<title>Preface:</title>
<p>The unique merits of Ramban&#x2019;s Commentary on the Torah have been touched upon in the Prefaces to the preceding two volumes: Genesis and Exodus. Here the attention of the reader is drawn to the following consideration:</p>
<p>The primary concern of the Commentary is to explain the text of the Torah and not to rationalize on it. True, throughout his work on this Book of Leviticus, Ramban achieves that rare combination of unflinching analysis of the basic laws of the Torah, together with an ordered reasoning of the philosophy thereof. Yet this is not the mainstay of the Commentary. Rather its main purpose is to clarify the precise meaning and intent of the word of G-d. The Torah is the summit of perfection, both in its totality and individual parts. When in the course of the study thereof, the Torah-student encounters difficulties, it is precisely at those points that the works of the great commentators throughout the generations constitute the answer to the prayer recited daily before the <italic>Sh&#x2019;ma</italic> in the morning: &#x201C;O put it into our hearts to understand and to discern &#x2026; &#x201D;</p>
<p>The Book of Leviticus has many different and difficult topics. Some &#x2014; such as those dealing with dietary laws and various festivals &#x2014; are surely familiar to the reader; others &#x2014; in particular the laws of the offerings, purity and impurity etc. &#x2014; may be difficult to comprehend at first. It is hoped that this translation of Ramban&#x2019;s Commentary, with the explanatory notes on the same page, assisting the reader at every turn, will fully clarify these subjects. The elaborate Index at the end of the book, will further facilitate to locate additional material on each topic. Attention is also called to the fact that references to the explanation of certain Hebrew terms, such as <italic>Asham talui, Kilayim, Sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic> etc. are included in the Index.</p>
<p>As in the first two volumes of this Commentary, it is my pleasant duty to gratefully acknowledge the services of Mr. Henry Petzenbaum and Mr. Joseph Salomon of Shilo Publishing House, Inc. for their painstaking care in the composition, correction and excellent appearance of the work as a whole.</p>
<p>Special recognition is due to Rabbi Berel Berkovits of London, England, for his invaluable suggestions on reading the manuscript.</p>
<p>May the Almighty deem me worthy to bring the translation of Ramban&#x2019;s Commentary on the remaining Books of the Torah to a conclusion &#x2014; <italic>l&#x2019;hagdil Torah ul&#x2019;ha&#x2019;adirah</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;for the sake of magnifying the Torah and manifesting its beauty.&#x201D;</p>

<title>The Book of Leviticus</title>
<p>&#x2018;VAYIKRA&#x2019; (AND HE CALLED).<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> This book is the law of the priests and the Levites.<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> In it G-d explains matters concerned with all the offerings and watching over the Tabernacle [that it should not become defiled].<sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> This is because one book [i.e., the second book of the Torah] was dedicated to the Egyptian exile and the redemption therefrom, and He completed it with an account of the building of the Tent of Meeting and the Glory of G-d which filled the Tabernacle,<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> therefore He now commanded Moses about the offerings and about watching over the Tabernacle, in order that the offerings effect atonement for [the children of] Israel, and that their sins should not bring about the removal of the Divine Glory. Thus He commanded <italic>the priests that come near unto the Eternal</italic> that <italic>they sanctify themselves</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup> warning them against defilement of the Sanctuary and its hallowed offerings,<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup> and also that they are not <italic>to break through to come up unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup> just as He said, <italic>Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the ark-cover which is upon the ark, that he die not; for I appear in the cloud upon the ark-cover</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup> which is similar to the warning [given at the Revelation] <italic>lest they break through unto the Eternal to gaze, and many of them perish</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn9">9</xref></sup> After that<sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup> He set limits to the Tabernacle, even as He had marked off Mount Sinai when the Glory of the G-d of Israel was there.</p>
<p>Thus the greatest part of this book deals with the offerings, the laws of the offering itself and of those who perform its rite and of the place where it is to be brought; some commandments are also mentioned incidentally to those dealing with the offerings. Thus at first He commanded concerning the freewill offerings,<sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup> and prohibited the eating of fat and blood on account of [mentioning] them.<sup><xref rid="fn12">12</xref></sup> Following that He commanded concerning the offerings that are to be brought upon committing a sin,<sup><xref rid="fn13">13</xref></sup> and incidentally to these He mentioned the laws of forbidden foods;<sup><xref rid="fn14">14</xref></sup> for they defile the person, and he who eats them or touches them must not touch any hallowed thing, nor come into the Sanctuary, and if he does go in there [or eat of the hallowed things] while in a state of uncleanness, he has to bring the offering of higher or lower value<sup><xref rid="fn15">15</xref></sup> which He had already mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup> After that it was necessary to mention the law of the leper<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup> and the ordinances of the woman in childbirth<sup><xref rid="fn18">18</xref></sup> and of the <italic>zav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup> and <italic>zavah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn20">20</xref></sup> in order to tell that they must bring an offering [at the end of the period of their uncleanness], and to warn them further concerning their uncleanness &#x2014; as He said at the end [of these laws], <italic>Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile My Tabernacle that is in the midst of them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn21">21</xref></sup> As a result of mentioning these laws, He warned afterwards about those persons with whom it is forbidden to have sexual relations,<sup><xref rid="fn22">22</xref></sup> since association with them defiles, and their sin is called &#x201C;defilement&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup> and brings about the removal of the Divine Glory, and exile.<sup><xref rid="fn24">24</xref></sup> Besides, he who commits any of these sins [of forbidden sexual relations] unwillfully, must bring the sin-offering which He mentioned already in the verse, <italic>And if anyone sin through error</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn25">25</xref></sup> Following that He mentioned the commandment of the Sabbath and the appointed seasons of the Eternal<sup><xref rid="fn26">26</xref></sup> on account of the offerings [which are brought on those days], just as He said, <italic>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</italic> etc. <italic>to bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn27">27</xref></sup> In most of the sections of this book He speaks with reference to the priests: <italic>Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> <italic>Command Aaron and his sons</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn29">29</xref></sup> In the section of <italic>Kedoshim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn30">30</xref></sup> however, there are some commandments addressed to the children of Israel, but most of them are mentioned because of some connection with the offerings or matters similar to them. I will explain them in their place with the help of the Holy One, blessed be He.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1">(1) I.e., <italic>And G-d called unto Moses</italic>. &#x2014; The third book of the Torah thus receives its title from the first Hebrew word of the book. The English title Leviticus is derived from the Septuagint &#x2014; the first Greek translation of the Bible &#x2014; which gave it that name because a major part of the book is devoted to the laws relating to the priests and Levites. In the Talmud and related literature it is called Torath Kohanim (Law of the Priests). This is to be distinguished from the early Rabbinic commentary on the book, known also as Torath Kohanim. See further, Notes 65, 73, and 121.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2">(2) Further, 25:32: <italic>But as for the cities of the Levites</italic> etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3">(3) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 15:31: <italic>Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile My Tabernacle that is in the midst of them</italic>. The reference could not be to the actual guarding of the Tabernacle done by the priests and Levites every night throughout the night, (see &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, pp. 31-32), for that duty is mentioned in the Book of Numbers (18:4). It may possibly be also a hint to the special Service on the Day of Atonement which was designed to atone for any uncleanness that may have occurred in the Tabernacle or any part thereof (see further 16:16, and 33). By bringing the prescribed offerings on that day Israel fulfilled its duty of &#x201C;watching over the Tabernacle&#x201D; that it should not continue in its state of defilement but instead should be restored to its pristine purity and holiness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4">(4) Exodus 40:34.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5">(5) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 19:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6">(6) See Ramban further, 5:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn7">(7) Exodus 19:24. Ramban&#x2019;s thought there is clearly based on his exposition [at the beginning of <italic>Seder Terumah</italic> &#x2014; <italic>ibid.</italic>, 25:1, Vol. II, pp. 435-436] that the Tabernacle constituted a continuation of the presence of the Divine Glory which had descended upon Mount Sinai. Ramban therefore continues here to show that the strictures which applied at the time of the Revelation find their parallels in the laws concerning the Tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn8">(8) Further, 16:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn9">(9) Exodus 19:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn10">(10) I.e., in the Book of Numbers (5:1-3). See Ramban there on Verse 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn11">(11) Freewill offerings are those which can be brought at any time by any individual. These include: the burnt-offering (Chapter 1), the meal-offering (Chapter 2), and the peace-offering (Chapter 3). On the other hand, the sin-offering (Chapter 4) and the guilt-offering (Chapter 5:14-26) can be brought only to expiate certain sins if committed unintentionally, and therefore are not freewill offerings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn12">(12) Further, 3:17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn13">(13) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Chapters 4-5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn14">(14) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Chapter 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn15">(15) This offering was so called [the offering of higher or lower value] because it did not have to be of one specified kind, but varied in accordance with the means of the transgressor who has to offer it. See in my translation of Rambam&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, pp. 82-83.</ftnote>

<title>Vayikra</title>
<h1>1</h1>
<p>1. AND HE CALLED UNTO MOSES; AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO HIM. Scripture states [the fact that G-d called to Moses] here and not in other places, because <italic>Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn31">31</xref></sup> and to draw near the place <italic>where G-d was</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn32">32</xref></sup> except through G-d calling him [to come into the Tent of Meeting]. For Moses had already been told, <italic>and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn33">33</xref></sup> <italic>where I will meet with thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn34">34</xref></sup> Since he knew that <italic>the Eternal that sitteth upon the cherubim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn35">35</xref></sup> was there, Moses was afraid to come into the Tent at all until He called him, just as it was at Mount Sinai where it is said, <italic>and on the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn36">36</xref></sup> Or it may be that Moses did not know that the Glory of G-d was in the Tent and that the communication to him would be from there,<sup><xref rid="fn37">37</xref></sup> since the cloud did not cover the Tent of Meeting until the eighth day of the installation according to the opinion of our Rabbis;<sup><xref rid="fn38">38</xref></sup> and after this call Moses came into the innermost part of the Tent [i.e., the Holy of Holies], just as the Rabbis have interpreted:<sup><xref rid="fn39">39</xref></sup> &#x201C;Aaron was not to enter [the Sanctuary except at the prescribed time], but Moses was not included in this command.&#x201D; This is the plain meaning of this verse. I have explained it already above.<sup><xref rid="fn40">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>But our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn41">41</xref></sup> that &#x201C;all communications [that came to Moses], whether they are introduced by the word <italic>dabeir</italic> (speak), or by <italic>emor</italic> (say), or <italic>tzav</italic> (command), were preceded by a call,&#x201D; that is to say, G-d said to him, &#x2018;<italic>Moses, Moses</italic>&#x2019; and he answered, &#x2018;<italic>Here am I</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn42">42</xref></sup> This was a way of expressing affection and encouragement to Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn43">43</xref></sup> Now according to this opinion, Scripture mentioned the expression [<italic>And He called unto him</italic> &#x2026;] here, because it was the first communication that came to Moses from the Tent of Meeting, thus teaching us concerning all the other communications that such was His procedure with him all the time and with the whole Torah. The expression <italic>out of the Tent of Meeting</italic> refers according to the Rabbis to the preceding words, [the interpretation of the verse thus being]: &#x201C;and He called unto him out of the Tent of Meeting; and the Eternal spoke to him in the Tent,&#x201D; for Moses was already there [in the Tent].<sup><xref rid="fn44">44</xref></sup> The explanation of the verse according to its plain meaning and sense is: &#x201C;and the Eternal called unto Moses and spoke unto him, out of the Tent of Meeting.&#x201D;</p>
<p>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], this verse is like, <italic>And unto Moses He said: &#x2018;Come up unto the Eternal.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn45">45</xref></sup> Its secret is known from the Revelation on Mount Sinai<sup><xref rid="fn46">46</xref></sup> and the Ten Commandments. I have alluded to it already.<sup><xref rid="fn45">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. WHEN ANY MAN BRINGETH OF YOU AN OFFERING UNTO THE ETERNAL OF THE CATTLE. The meaning of this verse is as follows: &#x201C;when any man of you brings from the cattle an offering to the Eternal, of the herd or of the flock you shall bring it.&#x201D; The reason for this command is that since He commanded afterwards concerning fowl-offerings<sup><xref rid="fn47">47</xref></sup> and meal-offerings,<sup><xref rid="fn48">48</xref></sup> He said here that when a man brings an offering of cattle, he must bring it of one of these two kinds [herd and flock], but not a wild beast nor any other cattle. Thus he who offers a beast [as an offering to G-d], violates a prohibition which is derived from a positive commandment [and carries the force of a positive commandment], just as the Rabbis have said in the third chapter of Tractate Zebachim:<sup><xref rid="fn49">49</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Yochanan said: one who offers the limbs of a [kosher] beast [upon the altar of G-d] transgresses a positive commandment.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C; &#x2018;TAKRIVU&#x2019; (YE SHALL BRING). This teaches that two [or more] persons may bring a freewill burnt-offering in partnership. YOUR OFFERING. This teaches that a burnt-offering may be brought as a freewill offering of the [entire] public [not only of groups of individuals]. This refers to the burnt-offering of the altar&#x2019;s summertime<sup><xref rid="fn50">50</xref></sup> which was supplied from the surplus [of the half-shekels of the past year].&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>The meaning of the Rabbi&#x2019;s interpretation is thus to state that if many persons voluntarily offer to bring a burnt-offering, it thereby becomes a burnt-offering of partners, for what difference is there between two persons who combine to bring an offering, and ten or a thousand who associate to do so? But the burnt-offering for the altar&#x2019;s summer-time which is supplied from the surplus [of the previous year&#x2019;s half-shekels], is deemed a &#x201C;burnt-offering of the public&#x201D; because the authorities [of the Sanctuary who receive the donations for the offerings] do so with the implied condition [that they may spend them at their discretion, and the burnt-offering of the public is distinguished in certain respects from a burnt-offering of partners]. Thus according to Rashi all burnt-offerings that are brought by many persons &#x2014; except those which come from the surplus of the half-shekels &#x2014; have the law of burnt-offerings of partners, and they all require the laying of [their owners&#x2019;] hands upon the offering,<sup><xref rid="fn51">51</xref></sup> and the libations connected with them<sup><xref rid="fn52">52</xref></sup> are taken from the owners [while &#x201C;burnt-offerings of the public&#x201D; need no laying of hands, and the libations are supplied by the Temple treasury]. Perhaps according to the opinion of Rashi it is permitted for the general public to offer [money] beforehand in order to bring a burnt-offering of fowls, which may be brought as a freewill offering by two [or more] persons but may [never] come as a freewill offering of the public, and similarly they [may combine to bring] a peace-offering, concerning which the Sages have said<sup><xref rid="fn53">53</xref></sup> that it may be brought by partners as a freewill offering but may not be brought by the public<sup><xref rid="fn54">54</xref></sup> &#x2014; and in that case it is called &#x201C;a burnt-offering of partners,&#x201D; or &#x201C;a peace-offering of partners.&#x201D; They [i.e., the burnt-offering of fowls and the peace-offering], were only excluded in that they cannot be brought from the [money of the] baskets [containing the surplus of half-shekels which were already donated by the public for the general upkeep of the offerings, and not specifically donated for a burnt-offering or peace-offering].</p>
<p>We may possibly say that if the public wanted originally to set aside a fund for freewill offerings, and they collected it [for that purpose] as they collected the <italic>shekalim</italic> for the Daily [public] Offerings and the Additional Offerings [of Sabbaths and festivals], that there may then be a freewill public-offering of the cattle,<sup><xref rid="fn55">55</xref></sup> and it will not require the laying of hands on it, being that it is included in this verse [as a public offering]. As long as it is the majority of Israel who donated money to that end, the offering is called &#x201C;a freewill offering of the public.&#x201D; [This rule applies only to the freewill burnt-offering of the cattle] but does not apply to the burnt-offering of fowls, nor to the peace-offering. But if a minority of the people donated towards the freewill burnt-offering, [even if they are a large group], they are deemed as individuals [who bring such an offering in partnership, which would thus require the laying on it of the owners&#x2019; hands, and the libations would have to be supplied by the owners]. This is the correct explanation.</p>
<p>4. AND HE SHALL LAY HIS HAND. This means his two hands, for we find it stated: <italic>and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn56">56</xref></sup> <italic>and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn57">57</xref></sup> and the Rabbis interpreted it to mean: &#x201C;the hands of each and every individual.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn58">58</xref></sup> Thus [it is clear that] both hands were required for it. In the case of the goat designed to be sent [to Azazel] it is expressly stated, <italic>And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn59">59</xref></sup> If so, I do not know why Scripture wrote &#x201C;his hand&#x201D; [in the singular] in all other cases of the laying of hands. Perhaps it is for the purpose of deriving therefrom what the Rabbis have interpreted:<sup><xref rid="fn60">60</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>His hand</italic> &#x2014; and not the hand of his proxy.&#x201D; For had it been written &#x201C;his hands&#x201D; [in the plural we would have interpreted it] to require the laying of both hands, and we would not have been able to exclude the proxy. But now that [we derive from other verses that] both hands must be laid upon the offering, [we must conclude that] He only wrote the singular [indicating the hands of only one person], to exclude a proxy, for although a man&#x2019;s proxy is like the man himself<sup><xref rid="fn61">61</xref></sup> in all other places, we should not consider him so in the case of the laying of hands. In Torath Kohanim we find:<sup><xref rid="fn62">62</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And Aaron shall lay both his hands</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn59">59</xref></sup> This teaches that the laying of hands upon the offering must be done with both hands, and forms the general rule for all cases of laying of hands, that they be done with both hands.&#x201D;</p>
<p>AND IT SHALL BE FAVORABLY ACCEPTED FOR HIM TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR HIM. &#x201C;For what kind of sins does [the freewill burnt-offering] effect atonement for the person that brings it? Should you say, for sins [where punishment if wilfully committed] is excision, or any of the [four] deaths imposed by the court, or death by the hands of Heaven, or stripes, the punishment for all these sins is already stated, [and atonement is affected by those punishments, and therefore not by this offering]&#x0021; You must conclude that [the freewill burnt-offering] effects atonement only for transgression of a positive commandment,<sup><xref rid="fn63">63</xref></sup> and for the violation of a negative commandment that is juxtaposed to a positive commandment.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn64">64</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, and it is a Beraitha<sup><xref rid="fn65">65</xref></sup> in Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn66">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>But I wonder&#x0021; Where is &#x201C;the punishment&#x201D; for these sins already stated, since offerings only effect atonement for unwilful violations?<sup><xref rid="fn67">67</xref></sup> Now we could say that [the freewill burnt-offerings] atone for those unwilful sins which the penalty [if committed wilfully] is death by the hands of Heaven, or stripes, or any of the [four] deaths imposed by the court, in such cases that do not obligate one to bring a sin-offering,<sup><xref rid="fn68">68</xref></sup> such as smiting one&#x2019;s father or mother, or cursing them,<sup><xref rid="fn69">69</xref></sup> just as the sin-offering atones for the unwilful sins for which the penalty [if committed wilfully] is excision. But perhaps it appeared to the Sages that since Scripture expressly states the punishment for both the wilful and unwilful commission of sins punishable by death imposed by the hands of the court or by excision, [stating that if committed wilfully, the sinner is liable to one of the above punishments, and if committed unwilfully, he must bring a sin-offering], and it further set forth the punishment of those liable to death by the hands of Heaven or stripes for certain sins, if committed wilfully, but did not mention in these [last two categories] any punishment if the sins are committed unwilfully &#x2014; therefore it appeared [to the Sages] that Scripture had completely set forth their case.<sup><xref rid="fn70">70</xref></sup> For why should Scripture have explained the punishment of some sins if committed either wilfully or unwilfully, and explained the punishment for other sins [only] if committed wilfully, but not if committed unwilfully, and did not say that he is obligated to bring a burnt-offering? Therefore the Sages concluded that in the case of those sins for which one is liable to death by the hands of Heaven or stripes, they are only punishable if committed wilfully, as explained in Scripture, but if committed unwilfully there is no burden of sin at all and they do not need any atonement. This is the meaning of the saying of the Rabbis [in the Torath Kohanim<sup><xref rid="fn66">66</xref></sup> mentioned by Rashi]: &#x201C;their punishment has already been stated,&#x201D; meaning that Scripture had already stated the whole punishment that G-d desired to impose on them. But for the wilful transgression of a positive commandment<sup><xref rid="fn63">63</xref></sup> and for the violation of a negative commandment that is juxtaposed to a positive commandment,<sup><xref rid="fn64">64</xref></sup> where Scripture mentioned no punishment whatever, and it is impossible that no penalty should be inflicted for them at all, in these cases the sinner is atoned for by this burnt-offering, if he brought it of his own freewill.</p>
<p>It is possible to say that because He did not use in the case of the freewill offerings<sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup> the expression: &#x201C;to make atonement for him concerning the error which he committed,&#x201D; as He said with reference to the offerings brought for sins committed unwilfully,<sup><xref rid="fn71">71</xref></sup> and instead He said, <italic>and it shall be favorably accepted</italic>, it appeared to our Rabbis that the meaning thereof is that [the burnt-offering] effects atonement for those who wilfully commit certain sins, seeing that these persons are not [hitherto] favorably accepted by Him. For he who commits a sin unwilfully is yet, in spite of his sin, considered favorably accepted by G-d. If so, it is impossible that the burnt-offering effect atonement for wilful sinners except for those who transgress a positive commandment or a negative commandment that is juxtaposed to a positive commandment, in which cases no punishment has been mentioned in Scripture, but they are not pleasing to G-d because they violated His commandment. With what can these men become favorably accepted by their Master?<sup><xref rid="fn72">72</xref></sup> With this gift&#x0021;</p>
<p>I have seen in the Agadah,<sup><xref rid="fn73">73</xref></sup> in Vayikra Rabbah:<sup><xref rid="fn74">74</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai taught: The burnt-offering only comes to effect atonement for sinful thoughts of the heart. Said Rabbi Levi: It is a clear Biblical text: &#x2018;<italic>V&#x2019;ha&#x2019;olah al ruchachem</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn75">75</xref></sup> (<italic>And that which cometh into your mind</italic>) <italic>shall not be at all</italic><sup><xref rid="fn76">76</xref></sup> &#x2014; the <italic>olah</italic> (burnt-offering) effects atonement for those things which come into your mind. Similarly it says of Job: <italic>and he offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, &#x2018;It may be that my sons have sinned, and blasphemed G-d in their hearts</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn77">77</xref></sup> This proves that the burnt-offering only comes to effect atonement for sinful thoughts of the heart.&#x201D; The reason why [the burnt-offering was singled out for this purpose] is because it is a sin that no one recognizes except G-d [Who knows our secret thoughts]; therefore it is wholly burnt to G-d.</p>
<p>The expression <italic>v&#x2019;nirtzah lo</italic><sup><xref rid="fn78">78</xref></sup> refers back to <italic>the Glorious Name</italic> mentioned [in the preceding verse: <italic>to the door of the Tent of Meeting he shall bring it for his acceptance before the Eternal</italic>], meaning that he should be favorably accepted by Him through this offering which effects atonement for him. This is similar in expression to these verses: <italic>for wherewith should this fellow &#x2018;yithratzeh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>reconcile himself</italic>) <italic>unto his lord?;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn79">79</xref></sup> <italic>and the light of Thy countenance because &#x2018;r&#x2019;tzitham&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>Thou wast favorable to them</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn80">80</xref></sup> and many others. It is possible that <italic>v&#x2019;nirtzah</italic> is a by-word for the sin, meaning that the sin is finished for him, so that he may now be forgiven, similar to these expressions: &#x2018;<italic>ki nirtzah avonah</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>that her guilt is paid off</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn81">81</xref></sup> <italic>until the land &#x2018;rotz&#x2019;thah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>had been paid</italic>) <italic>her Sabbaths</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn82">82</xref></sup> <italic>and they &#x2018;yirtzu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>shall be paid</italic>) <italic>the punishment of their iniquity</italic><sup><xref rid="fn83">83</xref></sup> &#x2014; all these being expressions of completion. It is further possible to say in line with the first interpretation, that the sin will be as if it were &#x201C;agreeable&#x201D; [not objectionable before G-d], meaning that His anger will no longer be kindled against him.</p>
<p>5. AND HE SHALL SLAUGHTER THE BULL BEFORE THE ETERNAL. AND THE PRIESTS, AARON&#x2019;S SONS, SHALL OFFER THE BLOOD. &#x201C;All acts from receiving [the blood in a vessel] onwards are the duty of the priests. This teaches that the slaughtering [of the offering] is valid if performed by a <italic>zar</italic> (non-priest). <italic>&#x2018;V&#x2019;hikrivu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and they shall offer</italic> &#x2026;) &#x2014; this refers to &#x2018;receiving&#x2019; [the blood], and the sense thereof is the bringing [of the blood to the altar]. Thus we learn that both of them [receiving the blood and bringing it to the altar], are to be done by Aaron&#x2019;s sons.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>But it is not correct.<sup><xref rid="fn84">84</xref></sup> Instead, the Midrash of our Rabbis states:<sup><xref rid="fn85">85</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>V&#x2019;hikrivu</italic> &#x2014; this is the receiving of the blood.&#x201D; For the term <italic>v&#x2019;hikrivu</italic> does not mean the bringing of the blood near to the altar, namely the <italic>holachah</italic> (carrying of it). Instead, <italic>v&#x2019;hikrivu</italic> is an expression similar to the word <italic>korban</italic> (offering) and it signifies receiving [of the blood in a vessel] and sprinkling it upon the altar. Thus He mentioned bringing it [to the door of the Tent of Meeting], laying hands on it, and slaughtering it with reference to the owner of the offering, and after the slaughtering He immediately mentioned the sons of Aaron. It accordingly follows that receiving the blood is in itself a duty to be performed by the priests, and may only be done by a qualified priest and with vessels dedicated to the Temple Service; and [it follows] all the more that bringing it to the altar and sprinkling it [can be done only by a qualified priest]. Moreover, even carrying of the limbs to the ramp [leading to the altar] is invalid if done by a non-priest, for so the Rabbis interpreted:<sup><xref rid="fn86">86</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And the priest shall offer it all, and cause it to ascend in fumes upon the altar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn87">87</xref></sup> &#x2014; this refers to carrying of the limbs to the ramp.&#x201D; If so, carrying the blood to the altar also may be done only by a priest with all the conditions of priesthood.</p>
<p>6. AND HE SHALL FLAY THE BURNT-OFFERING. He is commanded to flay it while it is whole and afterwards he sever it. The expression <italic>and he shall flay &#x2026; and he shall sever</italic> refers to the owner of the offering [even if he is a non-priest], just as He said, <italic>and he shall lay his hand</italic> &#x2026;<sup><xref rid="fn88">88</xref></sup> <italic>and he shall slaughter</italic><sup><xref rid="fn89">89</xref></sup> [which may also be done by a <italic>zar</italic> &#x2014; a non-priest], for flaying and severing are not functions relating to the actual offering and are therefore valid if done by a <italic>zar</italic>. This is why [in the following verse] He says again, <italic>And the sons of Aaron</italic> [<italic>the priest shall put fire upon the altar</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn90">90</xref></sup> Similarly, it is valid that the washing of the inwards be done by a <italic>zar</italic>. Hence He says, <italic>But its inwards and its legs he shall wash in water</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn91">91</xref></sup> that is, the owner of the offering, and afterwards, <italic>and the priest shall cause all to ascend in fumes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn91">91</xref></sup> He states it in the plural, <italic>and they shall put</italic> &#x2026;<sup><xref rid="fn90">90</xref></sup> <italic>and they shall set the pieces</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn92">92</xref></sup> because all duties performed by the priests are commanded in this form, since there are many priests gathered in the House of G-d to attend to the burnt-offerings, and <italic>in the multitude of the people is the King&#x2019;s glory</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn93">93</xref></sup> but it is not indispensable, since further on He taught, <italic>and the priest shall set them in order</italic><sup><xref rid="fn94">94</xref></sup> [thus showing that even a single priest may perform all the acts].<sup><xref rid="fn95">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE SHALL FLAY &#x2026; AND HE SHALL SEVER &#x2026; AND THE SONS OF AARON THE PRIEST SHALL PUT FIRE UPON THE ALTAR.<sup><xref rid="fn90">90</xref></sup> This is not the correct order of these actions, for the right way is that the priests should first put fire upon the altar, and only then should they sever the limbs. Such indeed was the order of the arrangement of the Daily Offering.<sup><xref rid="fn96">96</xref></sup> Similarly, the verse stating, <italic>And the priests, Aaron&#x2019;s sons, shall set the pieces, the head and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn92">92</xref></sup> and afterwards, <italic>But its inwards and its legs he shall wash in water</italic><sup><xref rid="fn91">91</xref></sup> &#x2014; does not mean to command that it be done in that order, for &#x201C;the setting&#x201D; [mentioned in Verse 8] refers to &#x201C;the burning&#x201D; of the pieces which He commanded further on [in Verse 9]: <italic>and the priest shall cause all to ascend in fumes</italic>. If so, the correct order of performance cannot be that he should bring up the pieces, and the head and the fat, and set them upon the fire that is upon the altar, and only afterwards should he wash the inwards and the legs and burn them&#x0021; Rather, he first severed it and washed it, and then he brought everything up and set them on the fire to be burnt. The reason [for the order] of the verses is thus as follows: First He mentioned the sprinkling of the blood<sup><xref rid="fn89">89</xref></sup> in order to teach that this comes before everything else. Then He gave the commandment concerning the burning of the limbs, stating [in Verse 6 before us] that he should flay [the animal] and sever it in order to set the pieces upon the fire after washing the inwards and the legs, and then he should burn them all at one time, this being the sense of the expression <italic>and the priest shall cause &#x2018;all&#x2019; to ascend in fumes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn91">91</xref></sup> The reason why Scripture repeated [the commandment] concerning the limbs, stating, <italic>and they shall set them&#x2026;upon the fire</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn92">92</xref></sup> <italic>and the priest shall cause all to ascend in fumes</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn97">97</xref></sup> is in order to teach us that after he arranges them upon the fire, he should not depart until the fire has taken hold of them and consumed them so that the fumes thereof ascend. Similarly, the reason why He preceded to mention the flaying and severing to that of making the fire, is in order to teach us that in a freewill burnt-offering [discussed in this section], there is no obligation to set the fire upon the altar before [these activities] as is the case with the Daily Offering, concerning which we were commanded, <italic>and the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn98">98</xref></sup> this being the first thing of all that was done <italic>in everything that pertaineth to the altar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn99">99</xref></sup> as is explained in Tractate Yoma.<sup><xref rid="fn96">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. &#x2018;V&#x2019;ETH HAPADER.&#x2019; Onkelos translated it: <italic>tarba</italic> (fat), and this is also the concensus of opinion of all commentators, the word (<italic>pader</italic>) having no companion in the Hebrew language. In my opinion the word is not a generic term for all kinds of fat, but signifies specifically the thin layer of fat which spreads over and divides between the inwards, and the word <italic>pader</italic> is one of those terms whose letters are interchangeable, thus: <italic>pader &#x2014; pared</italic> (division), [and is so called] since it divides between the upper and the lower inwards. That is why our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn100">100</xref></sup> that [when the limbs are taken up to the altar] the <italic>pader</italic> is spread over the throat of the animal at the place where the act of slaughter was performed, for this is considered regard for Him Who is on high, since that fat is fit to be spread and serve as a cover. It is also customary among the nobility of nations to spread it over a roast. If, however, the word <italic>pader</italic> is indeed a generic term for all kinds of fat, [it is my opinion that] fat is so called because it is the greasy substance which is &#x201C;separated&#x201D; from the flesh, and such in fact is the term used as an equivalent for fat by students of nature, as I will mention.<sup><xref rid="fn101">101</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. A BURNT-OFFERING. &#x201C;[He shall burn it] with the intention that it should be a burnt-offering [and not an offering of another category]. &#x2018;ISHEIH&#x2019; (A FIRE-OFFERING). When he slaughters it he should slaughter it with the intention of [burning it by] fire, [as will be explained further on]. Wherever the word <italic>isheih</italic> occurs, it is an expression of fire. PLEASING &#x2014; it is pleasing to Me that I have commanded and My will was done.&#x201D; This is the language of Rashi.</p>
<p>Now the Rabbi did not explain what is meant by &#x201C;the intention of [burning it by] fire.&#x201D; In the Gemara<sup><xref rid="fn102">102</xref></sup> the Rabbis have said: &#x201C;this is to exclude <italic>kabobo</italic>, which may not be done.&#x201D; Now the commentators<sup><xref rid="fn103">103</xref></sup> explained this to mean that he should slaughter it with the intention of placing it on flames burning the pile of wood upon the altar, and not of placing it upon dying coals which are in the process of being extinguished. To me it appears that the intention he needs to have is that the fire should burn it completely, and not that it should just be roasted there a little, the word <italic>kabobo</italic> being similar to the expression of the Rabbis in the chapter entitled &#x201C;A stubborn and rebellious son: &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn104">104</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>k&#x2019;basar kiba</italic> (like partly-roasted meat) which thieves eat.&#x201D; In Tractate Erubin we also find:<sup><xref rid="fn105">105</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>v&#x2019;nichbeiv</italic> (let him roast it) and eat it.&#x201D; Now some books have a reading in Tractate Zebachim:<sup><xref rid="fn102">102</xref></sup> &#x201C;this is to exclude <italic>gabobo</italic> (straw), which may not be done.&#x201D; Accordingly the meaning thereof is that he should have the intention to put it on a fire of wood, as it is written, <italic>on the wood that is on the fire</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn106">106</xref></sup> and he should not intend to put it upon a fire made of stubble and straw, similar to that which we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup><xref rid="fn107">107</xref></sup> &#x201C;If a double-stove had been heated with stubble and <italic>gabobo</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now this verse mentions a reason for the offerings, namely, that they are <italic>a fire-offering, of a pleasing odor unto the Eternal</italic>. The Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup><xref rid="fn108">108</xref></sup> that the reason for the offerings is because the Egyptians and the Chaldeans in whose lands the children of Israel were strangers and sojourners, used always to worship the herd and the flock, the Egyptians worshipping the sheep and the Chaldeans worshipping the demons whom they imagined as assuming the form of goats. To this day men of India never slaughter the herd. It was for this reason that He commanded [Israel] to slaughter these three species [of cattle: the herd, the flock, and the goats], to the Revered Name, so that it be known that the very act which the idol-worshippers considered to be the utmost sin [i.e., slaughtering the above species], that same act should be done as an offering before the Creator, and through it Israel&#x2019;s sins would be forgiven. For such is the way to cure people of false beliefs, which are the diseasees of the human soul, for all diseases and sicknesses are healed by medicines which are antithetical to them. These are the words [the Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon], and he expounded them at great length.</p>
<p>But these words are mere expressions, healing casually a severe wound<sup><xref rid="fn109">109</xref></sup> and a great difficulty, and making <italic>the table of the Eternal polluted</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn110">110</xref></sup> [as if the offerings were intended only] to remove false beliefs from the hearts of the wicked and fools of the world, when Scripture says that they are <italic>the food of the offering made by fire, for a pleasing odor</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn111">111</xref></sup> Moreover, [if the offerings were meant to eliminate] the foolish [ideas] of the Egyptians, their disease would not thereby be cured. On the contrary, it would increase the cause of sorrow, for since the intention of the above-mentioned wicked ones was to worship the constellations of the sheep and the ox, which according to their opinion possess certain powers [over human affairs], and which is why they abstain from eating them in deference to their power and strength, then if these species are slaughtered to the Revered Name, it is a mark of respect and honor to [these constellations]. These worshippers themselves were in the habit of so doing, as He has said, <italic>And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn112">112</xref></sup> and those who made the [golden] calf sacrificed to it.<sup><xref rid="fn113">113</xref></sup> Now the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] mentions<sup><xref rid="fn108">108</xref></sup> that the idol-worshippers used to sacrifice to the moon on the days of new-moon, and to the sun when it rose in a particular constellation known to them from their books. The disease of idolatry would surely have been far better cured if we were to eat [these animal-deities] to our full, which would be considered by them forbidden and repugnant, and something they would never do&#x0021;</p>
<p>Furthermore, when Noah came out of the ark with his three sons, there were as yet no Chaldeans or Egyptians in the world, yet he brought an offering, which was pleasing to G-d, as concerning it Scripture says, <italic>And the Eternal smelled the pleasing odor</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn114">114</xref></sup> and on account of it <italic>He said in His heart, &#x2018;I will not again curse the ground any more for man&#x2019;s sake.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn114">114</xref></sup> <italic>Abel likewise brought of the first-born of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Eternal had regard unto Abel and to his offering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn115">115</xref></sup> Yet there was as yet not the slightest trace at all of idol-worship in the world&#x0021; Balaam said, &#x2018;<italic>I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn116">116</xref></sup> His intent<sup><xref rid="fn117">117</xref></sup> then was not to eradicate from [Balak&#x2019;s mind] evil beliefs, nor was he commanded to bring the offerings. Instead, Balaam did so in order to approach G-d so that he would be reached by His communication. The Scriptural expression concerning the offerings is, <italic>My food which is presented unto Me for offerings made by fire, for a pleasing odor unto Me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn118">118</xref></sup> Far be it that they should have no other purpose and intention except the elimination of idolatrous opinions from the minds of fools&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn119">119</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is far more fitting to accept the reason for the offerings which scholars<sup><xref rid="fn120">120</xref></sup> say, namely that since man&#x2019;s deeds are accomplished through thought, speech and action, therefore G-d commanded that when man sins and brings an offering, he should lay his hands upon it in contrast to the [evil] deed [committed]. He should confess his sin verbally in contrast to his [evil] speech, and he should burn the inwards and the kidneys [of the offering] in fire because they are the instruments of thought and desire in the human being. He should burn the legs [of the offering] since they correspond to the hands and feet of a person, which do all his work. He should sprinkle the blood upon the altar, which is analogous to the blood in his body. All these acts are performed in order that when they are done, a person should realize that he has sinned against his G-d with his body and his soul, and that &#x201C;his&#x201D; blood should really be spilled and &#x201C;his&#x201D; body burned, were it not for the loving-kindness of the Creator, Who took from him a substitute and a ransom, namely this offering, so that its blood should be in place of his blood, its life in place of his life, and that the chief limbs of the offering should be in place of the chief parts of his body. The portions [given from the sin-offering to the priests], are in order to support the teachers of the Torah, so that they pray on his behalf. The reason for the Daily public Offering is that it is impossible for the public [as a whole] to continually avoid sin. Now these are words which are worthy to be accepted, appealing to the heart as do words of Agadah.<sup><xref rid="fn73">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], there is a hidden secret contained in the offerings. You may be introduced to it by that which our Rabbis have said in the Sifre<sup><xref rid="fn121">121</xref></sup> and at the end of Tractate Menachoth:<sup><xref rid="fn122">122</xref></sup> &#x201C;Shimon ben Azai said: Come and see what is written in the section of the offerings&#x0021; It does not say with reference to them <italic>E-il</italic> (G-d), nor <italic>Elokecha</italic> (thy G-d), nor <italic>Elokim</italic> (G-d), nor <italic>Sha-dai</italic> (Almighty), nor <italic>Tze-baoth</italic> (G-d of &#x2018;Hosts&#x2019;), but only, <italic>Yod Hei</italic> &#x2014; the Proper name of G-d [the Tetragrammaton &#x2014; &#x2018;Eternal&#x2019;] &#x2014; in order not to give an opponent [i.e., a believer in plurality] an occasion for a point of attack.<sup><xref rid="fn123">123</xref></sup> Perhaps you might say that He is in need of food, Scripture therefore says, <italic>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn124">124</xref></sup> I have only commanded you to bring the offerings in order that My Will should be said and fulfilled.&#x201D; In the beginning of Torath Kohanim we also find:<sup><xref rid="fn125">125</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Yosei says: Wherever an offering is mentioned by Scripture, the Tetragrammaton is used, in order not to give an opportunity for heretics to rebel&#x201D; [by finding pluralistic allusions against the principle of Unity]. These are the words of the Rabbis of blessed memory.</p>
<p>Now it is true that in the section of the Torah where the offerings are commanded it does not say <italic>E-il</italic> or <italic>Elokim</italic> (G-d). But we do find [elsewhere in Scripture] verses as follows: <italic>and thou shalt offer burnt-offerings thereon unto the Eternal &#x2018;Elokecha&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thy G-d</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn126">126</xref></sup> <italic>the bread of &#x2018;Elokeihem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>their G-d</italic>), <italic>they do offer;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn127">127</xref></sup> <italic>thou shalt sanctify him</italic> [the priest], <italic>for he offereth the bread of &#x2018;Elokecha&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thy G-d</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn128">128</xref></sup> In the psalm mentioned above it is written, <italic>Offer unto &#x2018;Elokim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>G-d</italic>) <italic>the offering of thanksgiving</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn129">129</xref></sup> It is further written: <italic>For our fathers have acted treacherously, and done that which was evil in the sight of the Eternal our G-d, and have forsaken Him &#x2026; Also they have closed the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy place unto &#x2018;Elokei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the G-d of</italic>) <italic>Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn130">130</xref></sup></p>
<p>But the whole subject is explained in the Torah [itself], as it is said, <italic>My offering, My bread &#x2018;l&#x2019;ishai&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>for My fire-offerings</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn131">131</xref></sup> and it is <italic>said, the food of &#x2018;isheh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the fire offering</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn132">132</xref></sup> meaning that the offerings are the food of <italic>isheh</italic>, and from it they are for the <italic>ishim</italic> &#x2014; the word <italic>isheh</italic> being an expression for &#x201C;fire.&#x201D; Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that <italic>isheih</italic> is an adjectival noun, meaning &#x201C;a fire-offering,&#x201D; qualifying the word &#x201C;all&#x201D; [<italic>and the priest shall cause &#x2018;all&#x2019; to ascend in fumes</italic>];<sup><xref rid="fn133">133</xref></sup> and in the case of the meal-offering where it says, <italic>and the priest shall cause to ascend in fumes the memorial-portion of it upon the altar, &#x2018;isheih&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a fire-offering</italic>), <italic>of a pleasing odor unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn134">134</xref></sup> [the word <italic>isheih</italic>] is adjectival to the word <italic>kometz</italic> [&#x201C;handful&#x201D; &#x2014; mentioned in the first part of the verse]. But this is not so. Rather, the word <italic>isheih</italic> is a noun like <italic>eish</italic> (fire), and <italic>olah isheih</italic> [mentioned in Verse 9 before us] is like <italic>olath eish</italic> (a burnt-offering of fire), <italic>of a pleasing odor unto the Eternal</italic>, and so are all similar expressions, their meaning being like <italic>lechem isheh</italic> (the food of the fire-offering).<sup><xref rid="fn135">135</xref></sup> The reason, however, why He did not say <italic>eish</italic> but said <italic>isheih</italic> [comprised of the letters: <italic>alef, shin, hei</italic>] is [to allude to] the plain meaning thereof, <italic>as it hath been shown thee in the mount</italic><sup><xref rid="fn136">136</xref></sup> at the Giving of the Torah, which refers to the offering in the attribute of justice. The slaughtering [of the offering] must be to the Name of the Eternal alone, meaning that [he who slaughters it] must have no intention to do so to anything else in the world, save unto the Name of the Eternal only, this being the meaning of the expression &#x2018;<italic>olah hu &#x2026; isheh hu</italic>&#x2019; (it is <italic>a burnt-offering &#x2026; a fire-offering</italic>)&#x2026;<sup><xref rid="fn137">137</xref></sup> That is why the verse says, <italic>For the &#x2018;ishei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>fire-offerings</italic>) <italic>of the Eternal, the bread of their G-d, they offer, and they shall be holy</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn138">138</xref></sup> for the offering of their G-d is unto the &#x2018;<italic>ishei</italic> of the Eternal; and therefore the Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn122">122</xref></sup> that in [the sections of the Torah giving] the commands for the offerings, it does not mention <italic>E-il</italic> or <italic>Elokim</italic> (G-d),<sup><xref rid="fn139">139</xref></sup> but <italic>a fire-offering unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn140">140</xref></sup> <italic>a pleasing odor unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn141">141</xref></sup> for the intention must be unto the Eternal alone, and he who performs the acts of offering it up should have no other intent or thought save only to the Proper Name [i.e., the Tetragrammaton]. This is the sense of the saying of the Sages:<sup><xref rid="fn142">142</xref></sup> &#x201C;Scripture has ordered all these Services to be devoted to the Proper Name.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And in the Torath Kohanim<sup><xref rid="fn143">143</xref></sup> it is said: &#x201C;<italic>Unto the Eternal</italic> &#x2014; unto Him Who created the world.&#x201D; It is this which the psalm states: <italic>Offer unto G-d the offering of thanksgiving, and pay thy vows unto the Most High;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn129">129</xref></sup> <italic>For the Eternal is the Most High, Fearful, a Great King over all the earth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn144">144</xref></sup> The vow [to bring the offering] may also only be taken unto the Proper Name. It is this which the psalm states, <italic>G-d, thy G-d, am I. I will not reprove thee for thy offerings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn145">145</xref></sup> just as He said, <italic>I am the Eternal thy G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn146">146</xref></sup> This is the sense of the whole psalm wherein it says, &#x2018;<italic>E-il Elokim Hashem</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>G-d, G-d, the Eternal</italic>) <italic>hath spoken, and called the earth</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn147">147</xref></sup> using the full Divine Name<sup><xref rid="fn148">148</xref></sup> in reference to the world,<sup><xref rid="fn149">149</xref></sup> and mentioning therein the offerings. It is with reference to this too that it is said [speaking of the offerings], <italic>They shall come up with acceptance on Mine altar, and I will glorify My glorious house</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn150">150</xref></sup> meaning to say that the offerings shall be brought for acceptance, which is upon His altar, and He will then glorify His glorious house when they go up for a pleasing odor, the word <italic>nicho&#x2019;ach</italic> (pleasing) being derived from the expressions: &#x2018;<italic>nachah</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>there rests</italic>) <italic>the spirit of Elijah on Elisha;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn151">151</xref></sup> &#x2018;<italic>vatanach</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>and there rested</italic>) <italic>the spirit upon them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn152">152</xref></sup> Likewise all terms of <italic>korban</italic> (offering) [from the root &#x2018;<italic>karav</italic>&#x2019;, near] are expressions of approaching, and unity. Therefore, it says, <italic>Nor did they offer burnt-offerings in the holy place unto the G-d of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn153">153</xref></sup> for the burnt-offering in the holy place is to the G-d of Israel. The angel taught Manoah the concept of the offerings when he said, <italic>Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn154">154</xref></sup> meaning that if Manoah were to make him food he would not accept it from him, as it would be unfit and an offering which is an abomination to G-d. <italic>But if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, unto G-d</italic> alone <italic>thou must offer it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn154">154</xref></sup> Then will it be for acceptance as the fire-offerings of the Eternal, as indeed <italic>the angel of the Eternal ascended in the flame of the altar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn155">155</xref></sup> Thus is the subject [of the offerings] explained and clarified. <italic>May the good Lord pardon</italic>&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn156">156</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND IF HIS OFFERING BE OF THE FLOCK. This section deals with the burnt-offering of the flock, and the law thereof is in every detail like that of the burnt-offering of the herd. That is why He shortened here the command, and did not mention &#x201C;and he shall lay his hands&#x201D; [upon the offering], nor &#x201C;and it will be acceptable&#x201D; [as mentioned above]. He said here in addition, however, that it be slaughtered <italic>on the side of the altar, northward before the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn157">157</xref></sup> in order to explain that the expression <italic>before the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn158">158</xref></sup> mentioned in connection with the bullock means the side of the altar northward. The meaning of <italic>yerech</italic> [<italic>of the altar</italic>] is &#x201C;the side&#x201D; of the altar, and in the northerly direction. The verse thus teaches that the ramp of the altar was on the south side, where the front of the altar was, concerning which it is said, <italic>before the Eternal, in front of the altar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn159">159</xref></sup> I have already explained the reason why the slaughtering was to be done on the north side.<sup><xref rid="fn160">160</xref></sup> Scripture states without specification, <italic>round about the altar</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn161">161</xref></sup> for the reference is to the altar mentioned above, <italic>that is at the door of the Tent of Meeting</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn162">162</xref></sup> It does not state [in this section] <italic>and he shall flay</italic> it, since it has already been mentioned [in the preceding section].<sup><xref rid="fn163">163</xref></sup> It states <italic>and the priest shall set them in order</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn164">164</xref></sup> to teach us that it is sufficient if one priest attends [to all the acts of the offering of the burnt-offering brought by an individual] as I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn163">163</xref></sup> for the sections on the offerings complement each other, the points not mentioned in one being explained in the other.</p>
<p>14. OF TURTLEDOVES OR OF YOUNG PIGEONS. Scripture chose these two species [of birds] because they are accessible and can be more easily caught than other [birds], just as our Rabbis have mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn165">165</xref></sup> with reference to <italic>any of the sheep, and any of the goats</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn166">166</xref></sup> that [Scripture chose these species so that] a person should be able to bring an offering from those animals that feed at his crib, and should not have to take his weapons, quiver and bow, <italic>to go out on the hunt to bring it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn167">167</xref></sup> He chose grown-up turtledoves<sup><xref rid="fn168">168</xref></sup> because they abstain [from pairing with strangers] and attach themselves only to their mates, and once they lose their companions they never associate with others. So Israel cleave to the Eternal their G-d,<sup><xref rid="fn169">169</xref></sup> and never attach themselves to another deity, Pigeons, on the other hand, are very jealous and as a result of their jealousy they part [from their previous mates] and take on other mates. Therefore He chose them [as offerings] only when they are young, before their mating begins, for as long as the pigeon is young it is attached with greater love to the nest where it is reared than are all other fowls. Our Rabbis have mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn170">170</xref></sup> that if a person touches the nest of all other fowls to take therefrom the young ones or the eggs, they leave it and never nest therein again, but the pigeon never abandons it under any condition. And so is [the people of] Israel. They will never exchange their Creator and His Torah, but &#x201C;either Jews or nailed to the stake.&#x201D; He did not choose cocks [as offerings although they are readily accessible] because of their inclination to lewdness.</p>
<p>Now the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup><xref rid="fn171">171</xref></sup> that the reason for choosing grown-up turtledoves and young pigeons as offerings is that these are the best of their species, since old pigeons are less tasty. But this is not true, for young pigeons are almost inedible as a result of their excessive moistness. If, however, we are to take into consideration their natural tendencies as far as eating them is concerned, it is possible that they were chosen for their special qualities; for turtledoves have a propensity to sharpening of the mind, and young pigeons have a propensity to benefit greatly those who are not fully-matured physically, such as youths in the intermediate stage between boyhood and maturity, and the like.</p>
<p>15. AND THE PRIEST SHALL BRING IT UNTO THE ALTAR. This &#x201C;bringing&#x201D; means bringing it up onto the altar, signifying that the priest is to bring up the bird onto the altar and nip off its head there, as the nipping off may only be done on top of the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn172">172</xref></sup> It is for this reason that the Rabbis interpreted:<sup><xref rid="fn172">172</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And the priest shall bring it</italic> &#x2026; Could you possibly think that a non-priest could come near the altar? If so, why does it say <italic>the priest &#x2026; shall nip off?</italic> It is to teach us that the nipping off be done [not with an instrument but] only by the priest himself.&#x201D; &#x201C;<italic>And he shall nip off &#x2026; and cause it to ascend in fumes &#x2026; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out</italic>. Is it possible to say that after he has burnt it, he should squeeze the blood out? But [the order of the wording] is to teach us that just as the burning of the head is to be done separately [as is indicated here in the verse, <italic>and he shall nip off its head, and cause it to ascend in fumes</italic>], and that of the body is to be done separately [as is stated further on in Verse 17: <italic>and he shall cleave it &#x2026; and cause it to ascend in fumes</italic>], so also the nipping off has to be done in this way, the head separately and the body separately. The plain meaning of the verse, however, is that the wording is to be inverted: and he shall nip off and cause it to ascend in fumes, and before the burning its blood shall have been wrung out.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>Now it is impossible to say [that the order of the verse can be explained to mean] that he should nip off its head and burn it, and afterwards wring the blood of the body on the wall of the altar and then burn the body, since no limbs of any offering may ever be burnt [on the altar] before the sprinkling of the blood, the principle <italic>for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life</italic><sup><xref rid="fn173">173</xref></sup> applying to all offerings. Therefore the Rabbis interpreted the verse [to mean] that Scripture intended only to liken the nipping off to the burning, so that in both cases the head should be treated by itself and the body by itself. The plain sense of the verse, however, is that &#x201C;he should nip off its head in order to burn it on the altar,&#x201D; thus teaching that the nipping off should be done in order to burn the head [separately, and not dispose of it otherwise], just as he will burn the body, concerning which He said, <italic>and the priest shall cause it to ascend in fumes</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn174">174</xref></sup> for such is Scriptures&#x2019; way of speaking about all offerings, as I have explained in connection with the severance into pieces of the burnt-offering.<sup><xref rid="fn163">163</xref></sup> However, Scripture states here, <italic>and the priest shall cause it to ascend in fumes</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn174">174</xref></sup> and did not say &#x201C;and he shall cause <italic>all</italic> to ascend&#x201D; [as it said above in Verse 9, in the case of the burnt-offering of the herd], because [here in the case of the burnt-offering of the fowl] the burning thereof was done in two separate stages: first he burnt the head, and then he removed the crop [from the body], and cleft it by the wings, and then he burnt the body, as we have been taught in Tractate Zebachim.<sup><xref rid="fn172">172</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND HE SHALL REMOVE &#x2018;ETH MURATHO B&#x2019;NOTZATHAH.&#x2019; &#x201C;<italic>Muratho</italic> refers to the place of the digested food, namely &#x2018;its crop.&#x2019; <italic>B&#x2019;notzathah</italic> means &#x2018;together with its entrails.&#x2019; The word <italic>notzah</italic> is a term for anything which is loathsome. Similarly: <italic>for &#x2018;natzu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>they are become loathsome</italic>) <italic>and are wandered away</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn175">175</xref></sup> That is what Onkelos intended in translating &#x2018;<italic>b&#x2019;notzathah&#x2019;</italic> as <italic>b&#x2019;uchleih</italic> (with its digested food). This is also the interpretation of Aba Yosei ben Chanan who said<sup><xref rid="fn172">172</xref></sup> that he removes the stomach together with it [i.e., the crop]. But our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn176">176</xref></sup> he cuts out with a knife an opening around the crop like a flap, and removes it together with the feathers [on the skin].&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>But it is not correct. For the word <italic>notzah</italic> in all places only means actual feathers. Similarly, <italic>for &#x2018;natzu&#x2019; and are wandered away</italic><sup><xref rid="fn175">175</xref></sup> means that they have acquired feathers [wings] to fly away from their places and go into exile, and there too they will [constantly] wander, not finding a resting-place. Similarly: <italic>for &#x2018;natzoh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>she must fly away</italic>) <italic>and get away</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn177">177</xref></sup> The Jerusalem Targum rendered [the above-mentioned verse: <italic>for &#x2018;natzu&#x2019; and are wandered away</italic>]:<sup><xref rid="fn175">175</xref></sup> &#x201C;for they are &#x2018;quarrelsome&#x2019; and have also wandered away.&#x201D; The Targum thus derived the word <italic>natzu</italic> from the expression, <italic>when men &#x2018;yinatzu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>strive</italic>) <italic>together</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn178">178</xref></sup> and the verse is thus stating that &#x201C;they strive with all the nations and wander away from them, and do not continue to live among them.&#x201D; This is a correct interpretation. But the word <italic>notzah</italic> in the sense of &#x201C;loathsome&#x201D; as the Rabbi [Rashi] has it, is not found. The interpretation of Aba Yosei which made it incumbent upon the priest to take also the stomach with the crop, is [not because he considers the word <italic>b&#x2019;notzathah</italic> to mean &#x201C;the place of its entrails,&#x201D; as Rashi understood him, but rather] because the crop and the gullet together with the stomach, comprising the organs for the digestion of food [in the bird], are all included in the term <italic>muratho</italic>, because in the stomach the food turns into <italic>r&#x2019;ie</italic> (dung). Aba Yosei thus does not differ at all with the First Sage who says that he should take it with the &#x201C;feathers,&#x201D; for we have been taught in a Mishnah of the sixth chapter of Tractate Zebachim<sup><xref rid="fn179">179</xref></sup> [with reference to the order of the burnt-offering of the bird]: &#x201C;He [i.e. the priest] came then to the body, and removed the crop and the feathers and the entrails that came forth with the crop, and cast them on the place of ashes.&#x201D; This Mishnah is in accordance with the teaching of Aba Yosei<sup><xref rid="fn180">180</xref></sup> and yet it mentions &#x201C;the feathers&#x0021;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn181">181</xref></sup></p>
<p>Onkelos&#x2019; opinion [in translating <italic>b&#x2019;notzathah</italic> as <italic>b&#x2019;uchleih</italic>, is not because he considered this to be the Aramaic rendition of the word <italic>b&#x2019;notzathah</italic>, so that you might think that he is of the opinion that the Hebrew word means &#x201C;the place of its digested food,&#x201D; as Rashi thought, but rather Onkelos&#x2019; opinion] is like that of the Sages, that he removed only the crop and its feathers together with the food therein which is the <italic>mur&#x2019;ah</italic> [but he did not remove its entrails]. Since the priest takes hold of the crop and removes the food therein with it, therefore Onkelos rendered it: &#x201C;and he shall remove <italic>yath zfokeih b&#x2019;uchleih</italic>,&#x201D; the expression being as if it had said: &#x201C;and he shall remove <italic>uchleih bizfokeih</italic>,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn182">182</xref></sup> for <italic>uchleih</italic> [according to Onkelos] is the Aramaic for the Hebrew <italic>muratho</italic> [as <italic>muratho</italic> is associated with the word <italic>r&#x2019;ie</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;dung,&#x201D; and &#x201C;food&#x201D; turns into dung], whereas <italic>zfokeih</italic> is the translation for the Hebrew <italic>b&#x2019;notzathah</italic> [as will be explained]. The verse [according to Onkelos] thus means as follows: he should remove the <italic>mur&#x2019;ah</italic>, which is the food, with the plumage upon it, meaning that he takes the crop with its skin and the feathers upon it. In a similar way Onkelos translated [the Hebrew <italic>&#x2018;ki sh&#x2019;mi b&#x2019;kirbo&#x2019; &#x2014; for My Name is in him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn183">183</xref></sup>]: <italic>arei bishmi meimreih</italic> (&#x201C;for in My Name is his word&#x201D;),<sup><xref rid="fn184">184</xref></sup> which, according to the Hebrew, he should have rendered into Aramaic as follows: <italic>arei sh&#x2019;mi b&#x2019;meimreih</italic> (for My Name is in his word). But Onkelos changed the order of the wording because of a certain reason known to him.<sup><xref rid="fn185">185</xref></sup> So also he translated the verse: <italic>And the two ends of the two wreathen chains</italic><sup><xref rid="fn186">186</xref></sup> &#x2014; &#x201C;and the two wreathen chains of the two ends.&#x201D; There are many other such cases.</p>
<p>17. AND HE SHALL REND IT &#x2018;BICHNAFAV&#x2019; &#x2014; &#x201C;together with its feathers. He need not pluck out the feathers of its plumage. <italic>Knafav</italic> means the actual feathers [not the wings].&#x201D; This is the language of Rashi. But it is not correct, for if so, then Scripture does not mention from which place he is to rend [the bird], whether from its front or back. Rather, the meaning thereof is as follows: &#x201C;he shall rend it at the place of its wings,&#x201D; for the letter <italic>beth</italic> [in the word <italic>bichnafav</italic>] serves here as &#x201C;the <italic>beth</italic> of apparatus,&#x201D; [teaching that the rending is to be done from the back of the bird where &#x201C;the wings&#x201D; are, for <italic>knafav</italic>, as will be explained, means &#x201C;its wings,&#x201D; and not &#x201C;its feathers&#x201D; as Rashi explained]; similar to the expression, <italic>ba&#x2018;aron</italic>, (in the ark), <italic>ba&#x2019;bayith</italic>, (in the house), or <italic>ba&#x2019;sadeh</italic> (in the field). <italic>Knafav</italic> does not mean &#x201C;feathers&#x201D; [as Rashi wrote], but is similar to all expressions of <italic>knafayim</italic> mentioned in Scripture [which mean wings]: <italic>every bird, whatever hath &#x2018;kanaf&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>wings</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn187">187</xref></sup> <italic>and he stretcheth &#x2018;knafav&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>his wings</italic>) <italic>towards the south</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn188">188</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>&#x2018;bichnaf&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the skirt</italic>) <italic>of his robe</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn189">189</xref></sup> <italic>Notzah</italic> is the down [the soft under-plumage] on the body of birds, something like that which is written, <italic>a great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of &#x2018;hanotzah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>down</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn190">190</xref></sup> Similarly we have learned [in the Mishnah]:<sup><xref rid="fn191">191</xref></sup> &#x201C;Large feathers and down are both capable of contracting uncleanness and conveying uncleanness, and join together [with the flesh to make up the required size that is needed to convey uncleanness].&#x201D; The Rabbis have also said:<sup><xref rid="fn192">192</xref></sup> &#x201C;excepting the beak and claws, the large feathers and the down.&#x201D;</p>
<h1>2</h1>
<p>1. AND HE SHALL POUR OIL UPON IT AND PUT FRANKINCENSE THEREON. 2. AND HE SHALL BRING IT TO AARON&#x2019;S SONS. &#x201C;This teaches that the pouring of the oil and the mingling of it together with the flour [of the meal-offering] is valid if done by a non-priest. TO AARON&#x2019;S SONS THE PRIESTS; AND HE SHALL TAKE OUT HIS HANDFUL. From the taking of the handful [for the altar] and onwards is the duty of the priests.&#x201D; This is the language of Rashi. Now we have to explain that the duty of the priests does not begin with the taking of the handful, for bringing the meal-offering near [to the altar] precedes the taking of the handful, and that too is invalid when done by a non-priest, as He said, <italic>and he shall present it unto the priest, and he shall bring it nigh unto the altar</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn193">193</xref></sup> and afterwards it says, <italic>and the priest shall remove from the meal-offering the memorial-part thereof</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn194">194</xref></sup> which is the handful. Thus you see that it is the priest who brings the meal-offering near the altar, to the south-west corner thereof,<sup><xref rid="fn195">195</xref></sup> and after that he removes the handful [to be burnt on the altar]. So also we have learned [in the Mishnah]:<sup><xref rid="fn196">196</xref></sup> &#x201C;The acts of laying hands upon the offering, the wavings,<sup><xref rid="fn197">197</xref></sup> bringing [the meal-offering] near [to the altar], and removing the handful are performed by men and not by women.&#x201D; In explanation thereof the Rabbis said [there in the Gemara]:<sup><xref rid="fn196">196</xref></sup> &#x201C;bringing near [can be performed only by men] because it is written, <italic>And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall bring it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn198">198</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>the sons of Aaron</italic> but not the daughters of Aaron.&#x201D; This being the case, the bringing near [of the meal-offering to the altar] is the duty of the sons of Aaron. But the intention of the Sages in saying: &#x201C;From the taking of the handful and onwards is the duty of the priests&#x201D; [as quoted by Rashi above], is to say that from this taking of the handful mentioned in this verse and onwards, is the duty of the priests, but not these things which Scripture mentioned here as preceding the taking of the handful, since He mentioned already in this section pouring the oil [and mingling it with the flour], putting the frankincense thereon and bringing it to the priest, and [the priest&#x2019;s] removing the handful. However, bringing it near to the altar is not mentioned here, [but is stated further on in <italic>Seder Tzav</italic> 6:7] that all those things stated here before the taking of the handful &#x2014; namely, pouring the oil and mingling it with the flour, and bringing it to the priest &#x2014; are valid if done by a non-priest.</p>
<p>11. NO MEAL-OFFERING, WHICH YE SHALL BRING UNTO THE ETERNAL, SHALL BE MADE WITH LEAVEN. Here He prohibited the bringing of a meal-offering in leaven form. After that He said, <italic>Ye shall not &#x2018;thaktiru&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>cause to ascend in fumes</italic>) <italic>either any leaven or honey</italic>, in order to prohibit the leavening of the handful and burning it upon the altar, this being included in the expression <italic>ye shall not cause to ascend in fumes</italic> &#x2026; All terms of <italic>haktarah</italic> are expressions of burning aromatics, for druggists say<sup><xref rid="fn199">199</xref></sup> that honey would have been appropriate for the incense,<sup><xref rid="fn200">200</xref></sup> but the Torah prohibited it.<sup><xref rid="fn201">201</xref></sup> Scripture states <italic>any of it</italic> in order to prohibit [leaven or honey] even as a part of it, that is to say, even in one half of the handful. Similarly, one is liable to the punishment of stripes for mixing [leaven or honey with the handful in such a way that it is not recognized], because Scripture included it in saying, <italic>for ye shall not cause to ascend in fumes &#x2018;any&#x2019; leaven or &#x2018;any&#x2019; honey</italic>, as is explained in Tractate Menachoth<sup><xref rid="fn202">202</xref></sup> and in Tractate Pesachim.<sup><xref rid="fn203">203</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reason why Scripture mentions here <italic>minchah hi</italic><sup><xref rid="fn204">204</xref></sup> [in the feminine] while it is written <italic>hu</italic> [in the masculine], and similarly in all places,<sup><xref rid="fn205">205</xref></sup> [will be understood]<sup><xref rid="fn206">206</xref></sup> from the section, <italic>Behold, I send a messenger before thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn207">207</xref></sup> So also &#x2018;<italic>ha&#x2019;ishah hahi&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>that woman</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn208">208</xref></sup> [is written <italic>hahu</italic> in the masculine, while it is read <italic>hahi</italic> in the feminine], because the feminine is potentially included in the masculine.</p>
<p>It is possible that the reason why we are forbidden to bring leaven and honey [upon the altar] is as the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] states in the Moreh Nebuchim,<sup><xref rid="fn209">209</xref></sup> where he says that he found it written in their books that the custom among the idolaters was to offer all their meal-offerings only in leavened form, and to season all their sacrifices with honey; therefore He forbade bringing them on His altar. Our Rabbis have similarly said with reference to monuments [of one stone raised in order to sacrifice on it], that this was a favored mode of worship in the days of the patriarchs,<sup><xref rid="fn210">210</xref></sup> and afterwards G-d hated it<sup><xref rid="fn211">211</xref></sup> because [the Canaanites] had made it an ordinance of an idolatrous character, as He said, <italic>which the Eternal thy G-d hatheth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn211">211</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concerning the reason why we were commanded to offer salt with every offering,<sup><xref rid="fn212">212</xref></sup> [Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon] also said<sup><xref rid="fn209">209</xref></sup> that it is because the idolaters rejected it and did not offer it at all to their idols; [therefore He commanded us to have salt in every offering]. It is possible that [we are commanded to offer salt because] it is not respectful that the food which is offered up to G-d should have no flavoring, being without salt,<sup><xref rid="fn213">213</xref></sup> similar to that which is written, <italic>Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn214">214</xref></sup> That is why the Sages excluded wood and blood<sup><xref rid="fn215">215</xref></sup> from the requirement of being offered with salt [since they are not edible]. Or it may be that there is in all these matters some secret hidden from us.</p>
<p>In the case of leaven and honey Scripture speaks in the plural [<italic>for &#x2018;ye&#x2019; shall not cause to ascend in fumes, either any leaven or honey</italic>] because it speaks to Aaron and his sons. After that it says, <italic>And every meal-offering of &#x2018;thine&#x2019; shalt &#x2018;thou&#x2019; season with salt</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn212">212</xref></sup> because it refers to him who brings the meal-offering, concerning whom it said at the beginning of the section, <italic>And if thy offering be a meal-offering of the stewing-pan;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn216">216</xref></sup> and the reason [why it refers to salting by the person who brings the offering, is because] it is valid if done by a non-priest,<sup><xref rid="fn217">217</xref></sup> just as pouring the oil and mingling it with the flour are [as explained above in Verse 2]. <italic>Upon all thine &#x2018;offering&#x2019; thou shalt offer salt</italic><sup><xref rid="fn218">218</xref></sup> means &#x201C;upon all thine offerings&#x201D; [in the plural], for all offerings have to be offered with salt, just as the meal-offering.</p>
<p>13. NEITHER SHALT THOU SUFFER THE SALT OF THE COVENANT OF THY G-D TO BE LACKING FROM THY MEAL-OFFERING. &#x201C;For a covenant was established with salt as far back as the six days of Creation, for the lower waters [i.e., those of the oceans] were promised that they would be offered upon the altar in the form of salt, and [also as water] at the libation of water, on the Festival of Tabernacles.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn219">219</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, and it is a homiletic exposition of the Sages.<sup><xref rid="fn220">220</xref></sup> Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted it in line with the plain meaning of Scripture as follows: &#x201C;I have brought you into a covenant and made you swear that you would not offer a saltless offering, nor shall it [i.e., a saltless offering] be eaten,<sup><xref rid="fn221">221</xref></sup> because it is a mark of contempt.&#x201D; Now since salt is the covenant of the offerings, Scripture made this accord the pattern for all such agreements, saying of the gifts given to priests and the dynasty of David that they are [an everlasting] <italic>covenant of salt</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn222">222</xref></sup> meaning that they are as everlasting as the covenant of salt of the offerings. There, however, Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained:<sup><xref rid="fn223">223</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>A covenant of salt</italic> &#x2014; a covenant decreed, it being of the root, <italic>a fruitful land into a salt waste</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn224">224</xref></sup> since a salt waste is as if it has been decreed [upon it that nothing should grow therein].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn225">225</xref></sup> But there is no sense to his words.</p>
<p>Now it seems to me that since Scripture here states, <italic>the covenant of thy G-d</italic>, and does not say &#x201C;the covenant of the Eternal,&#x201D; which would have been in consonance with the language of the section and the way all the offerings are mentioned [throughout Scripture], or did not say, &#x201C;the covenant of the Eternal thy G-d&#x201D; &#x2014; that the reason for this is because salt is derived from water, and it is through the power of the sun which shines upon it that it becomes salt. Now the nature of water is that it soaks into the earth and makes it bring forth and bud; but after it becomes salt it destroys every place and burns it, <italic>that it is not sown, nor beareth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn226">226</xref></sup> Since a covenant is inclusive of all attributes, water and fire come into it, and <italic>unto</italic> her <italic>shall come the former dominion</italic><sup><xref rid="fn227">227</xref></sup> &#x2014; the Kingdom of G-d, just like salt which seasons all foods and helps to preserve them, but destroys them when they are over-saturated with it. Thus salt is like the covenant. It is for this reason that Scripture states, <italic>Ought ye not to know that the Eternal, the G-d of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt</italic><sup><xref rid="fn228">228</xref></sup> forever? For this too is the attribute of David. Therefore He says in connection with the offerings, <italic>it is an everlasting covenant of salt</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn223">223</xref></sup> for the covenant is &#x201C;the salt of the world,&#x201D; and by virtue of it [the world] exists or may be destroyed. I have already taught you to understand from our words in other places the meaning of these three words, <italic>brith olam hi</italic> (<italic>it is a perpetual covenant</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn229">229</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. V&#x2019;IM (AND IF) THOU BRING A MEAL-OFFERING OF FIRST-FRUITS. &#x201C;The word <italic>im</italic> (if) here has the meaning of <italic>ki</italic> (when), for the bringing [of this meal-offering of the first-fruits] is not a voluntary matter, since Scripture speaks here of the meal-offering of the new barley, which is obligatory.<sup><xref rid="fn230">230</xref></sup> Similarly, &#x2018;<italic>V&#x2019;im&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and if</italic>) <italic>the Jubilee of the children of Israel shall be</italic><sup><xref rid="fn231">231</xref></sup> [means &#x2018;when&#x2019; the Jubilee will be &#x2014; for it is bound to come].&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>The correct interpretation is that He used the expression <italic>im</italic> (if) because He is not commanding the performance now of this precept [namely bringing the meal-offering of the new barley], and He is thus saying: &#x201C;When you offer a meal-offering baked on the griddle<sup><xref rid="fn232">232</xref></sup> you shall do it in such-and-such a way; and if you offer a meal-offering of the stewing-pan,<sup><xref rid="fn233">233</xref></sup> you shall make it in another way; and if the meal-offering you will bring will be the one of first-fruits, you should do it in this manner.&#x201D; Thus the word <italic>im</italic> is here to be understood in its literal sense [namely, &#x201C;if&#x201D;]. Then the meaning of the verse, &#x2018;<italic>V&#x2019;im&#x2019;the Jubilee of the children of Israel shall be</italic><sup><xref rid="fn231">231</xref></sup> is as follows: [The heads of the fathers&#x2019; houses of the tribe of Manasseh] said to Moses: &#x201C;Even &#x2018;if&#x2019; the children of Israel will inherit the Land forever, and will be privileged to sanctify the year of the Jubilee, the inheritance [of Zelophchad] will not return to us&#x201D; [because his daughters might marry men from other tribes, which would cause the land to be transferred to other tribes].</p>
<p>It is also possible that He is stating: &#x201C;And if you bring a meal-offering of the first-fruits, you shall do it in this prescribed way,&#x201D; as if He were to say, &#x201C;if the Eternal your G-d will bring you into the Land, and you will reap the harvest thereof and bring the meal-offering of the first-fruits, you shall do it in such-and-such a manner; &#x201D; for G-d always mentions the inheritance of the Land to them conditionally, just as He said, <italic>For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment &#x2026; then will the Eternal drive out all these nations from before you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn234">234</xref></sup> and so also in many places.</p>
<h1>3</h1>
<p>1. AND IF HIS OFFERING BE A SACRIFICE OF PEACE-OFFERINGS: IF HE OFFER OF THE HERD, WHETHER MALE OR FEMALE. The reason why the burnt-offering may only be male,<sup><xref rid="fn235">235</xref></sup> whereas in the case of the peace-offering it can be male or female, and the sin-offering must only be female,<sup><xref rid="fn236">236</xref></sup> is very clear, since the <italic>olah</italic> (the burnt-offering) is as its name indicates, [i.e., &#x201C;ascension&#x201D; &#x2014; being that it reaches above all Divine attributes], whilst <italic>sh&#x2019;lamim</italic> (the peace-offering) is of the expressions: <italic>and all My pleasures &#x2018;yashlim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he will perform</italic> &#x2014; literally: he will &#x201C;perfect&#x201D;);<sup><xref rid="fn237">237</xref></sup> &#x2018;<italic>avanim sh&#x2019;leimoth</italic>&#x2019; (whole stones).<sup><xref rid="fn238">238</xref></sup> The sin-offering is in order to appease Him <italic>with the present that goeth before</italic><sup><xref rid="fn239">239</xref></sup> Him. I have already written on this matter.<sup><xref rid="fn240">240</xref></sup> The guilt-offering must be a male,<sup><xref rid="fn241">241</xref></sup> because the sin-offering is brought for those transgressions [for which, if committed wilfully, the sinner] incurs the penalty of excision, in order that <italic>the spirit return unto G-d who gave it,</italic><sup><xref rid="fn242">242</xref></sup> but the guilt-offering is not brought for those transgressions for which [if committed wilfully] one incurs excision, and therefore it is as if it were for <italic>a pleasing odor</italic> just like the burnt-offering.<sup><xref rid="fn243">243</xref></sup> The sin-offering of the prince is a he-goat,<sup><xref rid="fn244">244</xref></sup> because the prince is the sovereign unto whom judgment [rightfully] belongs,<sup><xref rid="fn245">245</xref></sup> and he fights the battles of G-d and lives by his sword;<sup><xref rid="fn246">246</xref></sup> therefore his offering is the same as the he-goat brought in case of idol-worship [by the congregation].<sup><xref rid="fn247">247</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND AARON&#x2019;S SONS SHALL CAUSE IT TO ASCEND IN FUMES. This is like His saying further on, <italic>And the priest shall cause them to ascend in fumes</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn248">248</xref></sup> for there He alludes to all those portions of the offering which are burnt on the altar, [hence He refers to them in the plural, while here He alludes to the offering as such, and therefore He speaks of it in the singular]. The interpretation [of the Rabbis] on it is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn249">249</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And Aaron&#x2019;s sons shall cause it to ascend</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn250">250</xref></sup> <italic>And the priest shall cause it to ascend</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn251">251</xref></sup> <italic>And the priest shall cause them to ascend</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn252">252</xref></sup> Why are all these verses mentioned? <italic>And Aaron&#x2019;s sons shall cause it to ascend</italic><sup><xref rid="fn250">250</xref></sup> &#x2014; only if the offering is acceptable, but not if it has become disqualified. <italic>And the priest shall cause it to ascend</italic><sup><xref rid="fn251">251</xref></sup> &#x2014; [this teaches] that he should not mix the fats of one offering with those of another [even though they are both of the flock]. <italic>And the priest shall cause them to ascend</italic> &#x2014; [this teaches] that he should burn them all at one time.&#x201D;</p>
<p>9. &#x2018;CHELBO&#x2019; (THE FAT THEREOF) &#x2018;HA&#x2019;ALYAH TH&#x2019;MIMAH&#x2019; (THE FAT TAIL ENTIRE). The term <italic>cheilev</italic> (fat) in the Sacred Language indicates that part of the fat which is separate from the meat and not joined to it. <italic>Shuman</italic>, on the other hand, is that fat which is intertwined with the meat and cannot be separated from it, something like that which Scripture states: &#x2018;<italic>Vayishman Yeshurun</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>But Jeshurun waxed fat</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn253">253</xref></sup> <italic>so they did eat, and were filled &#x2018;vayashminu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and became fat</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn254">254</xref></sup> &#x2018;<italic>hashmein</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>make fat</italic>) <italic>the heart of this people;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn255">255</xref></sup> <italic>and my flesh is lean &#x2018;mishamen&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and hath no fatness</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn256">256</xref></sup> <italic>and it shall be rich &#x2018;v&#x2019;shamein&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and fat</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn257">257</xref></sup> <italic>my soul is satisfied as with marrow &#x2018;vadeshen&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and fatness</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn258">258</xref></sup> and similarly in all places. But <italic>cheilev</italic> is the fat which is separate from the meat and covered by a membrane, and is easily peeled off. The Hebrew language never interchanges these terms [<italic>cheilev</italic> and <italic>shuman</italic>] in any place. Thus we say, <italic>basar shamen</italic> (fat meat), but not <italic>basar cheilev</italic> [since <italic>cheilev</italic>, as explained, is the fat which is separate and distinguished from the meat]. Similarly in languages of other nations these terms are separate. The term <italic>cheilev</italic> is sometimes used metaphorically, as is written, <italic>when ye set apart &#x2018;chelbo&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the best thereof</italic>) <italic>from it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn259">259</xref></sup> since the good part of the produce which is taken up [to be given to the priest], Scripture figuratively calls <italic>cheilev</italic>, just as the <italic>cheilev</italic> is set apart in the offerings. &#x2018;<italic>Cheilev kilyoth</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>the kidney-fat</italic>) <italic>of wheat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn260">260</xref></sup> &#x2014; Scripture here compares wheat to the kidneys and the fat therein, just as it states, <italic>and of the blood of the grape thou drankest foaming wine</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn260">260</xref></sup> although wine is not blood [hence we must conclude that Scripture only uses these terms figuratively]. <italic>And ye shall eat the &#x2018;cheilev&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>fat</italic>) <italic>of the land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn261">261</xref></sup> means that they shall eat the best of the bullocks, sheep, and goats and all animals. Such is the usage of this figure of speech.</p>
<p>Now the tail does not contain any <italic>cheilev</italic> at all,<sup><xref rid="fn262">262</xref></sup> but rather has in it <italic>shuman</italic> (fat) which is not separate from the meat thereof, just as there is <italic>in every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn263">263</xref></sup> This is confirmed by doctors who in their studies of nature have established the fact that <italic>cheilev</italic> [fat which is separate from the meat], is never to be found [in the animal] near the hide, nor in a limb which is always in movement [such as the tail]. The doctors have further said that the nature of <italic>shuman</italic> found in the ribs, sides and tail, which is not separate from the meat, is warm and moist, whilst that fat which can be separated from the meat, such as that which is upon the kidneys, is cold and moist, thick and coarse; it is difficult for the stomach to digest it fully, and it easily spoils; it also increases the white fluid<sup><xref rid="fn264">264</xref></sup> and constipates.</p>
<p>If so, the verse stating, <italic>Eat ye not any &#x2018;cheilev&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>fat</italic>) <italic>nor blood</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn265">265</xref></sup> does not include the <italic>shuman</italic> (fat) which is upon the tail, for that is not <italic>cheilev</italic> by name or nature. If all fat were to come under the term <italic>cheilev</italic>, then all fat in an animal &#x2014; on the shoulders and sides &#x2014; would not be allowed to be eaten&#x0021; For Scripture does not say: &#x201C;All fat which is offered unto G-d ye shall not eat&#x201D; [so that you would include in this prohibition the fat of the tail, since it is offered as a fire-offering on the altar]. Rather, He states that &#x201C;the <italic>cheilev</italic> (fat) of all cattle which are brought as offerings upon the altar, must not be eaten.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn266">266</xref></sup> It is indeed impossible to say that He prohibited all these fats of the animal which are offered on the altar, for if so the kidneys and the lobe above the liver would be forbidden to be eaten [since they are offered on the altar]&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn267">267</xref></sup> Rather, whatever fat comes under the term <italic>cheilev</italic> [as explained above], is forbidden to be eaten, even though it is not brought on the altar, such as the fat on the spleen; and that which is not called <italic>cheilev</italic> may be eaten even though it is offered on the altar, such as the [fat of the] kidneys and the lobe above the liver, and similarly also that of the tail [which even though it is brought on the altar, may be eaten because it is <italic>shuman</italic> and not <italic>cheilev</italic>]. Similarly, Scripture states in connection with the command of the installation of the priests, <italic>And thou shalt take of the ram &#x2018;ha&#x2019;cheilev&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the fat</italic>) <italic>and the tail;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn268">268</xref></sup> and at the performance thereof it is written, <italic>And he took the fat, and the tail</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn269">269</xref></sup> for the tail is not <italic>cheilev</italic>. Now this verse [before us] which states &#x2018;<italic>chelbo ha&#x2019;alyah th&#x2019;mimah</italic>&#x2019;, means that he shall offer up [from the peace-offerings] the fat thereof, together with the entire fat tail, meaning that when he removes the &#x201C;entire fat tail&#x201D; until the rump-bone, he must take with it much fat that is attached to it on the inside. Thus the Rabbis have said in Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn270">270</xref></sup> &#x201C;This tells us that he must also take the fat near the tail, which is the fat between the sinews [in the loins].&#x201D;</p>
<p>In my opinion the purport of this verse is also like that of the other verse: <italic>And he shall offer of it all &#x2018;chelbo&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the fat thereof</italic>)<italic>: &#x2018;ha&#x2019;alyah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the fat tail</italic>), <italic>and the fat that covereth the inwards</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn271">271</xref></sup> So here likewise He says, <italic>And He shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings</italic> all the fat thereof. In these two verses [just quoted], He first makes a general statement, that [the priest] should offer all the fat thereof, and then He mentions in detail all the parts that he should offer [namely, <italic>the fat tail entire &#x2026; and the fat that covereth the inwards &#x2026; and the two kidneys, and the fat upon them &#x2026; and the lobe above the liver</italic> &#x2026;]. Now not everything that is mentioned here is <italic>cheilev</italic> [fat forbidden to be eaten], for the two kidneys [themselves] and the lobe above the liver are not at all included in the term <italic>cheilev</italic>. Thus He stated in the section of <italic>Bayom Ha&#x2019;shemini:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn272">272</xref></sup> <italic>And &#x2018;ha&#x2019;cheilev&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the fat</italic>), <italic>and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn273">273</xref></sup> mentioning the <italic>cheilev</italic> by itself and then the other inwards by themselves, even as He said, <italic>And thou shalt take of the ram &#x2018;ha&#x2019;cheilev&#x2019; and the tail</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn268">268</xref></sup> If so, the reason why the tail is offered [on the altar] is not because it is included here in Verse 9] in the term <italic>chelbo</italic>. Rather, He states here that the priest should burn [on the altar] from the peace-offerings all the fat thereof, and then He proceeds to explain all the inwards [which he should offer], some being <italic>cheilev</italic> and some not. The meaning of the verse in the case of the sin-offering stating, <italic>And all the fat thereof he shall take away, as &#x2018;cheilev&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the fat</italic>) <italic>is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn274">274</xref></sup> is not to refer only to that which is strictly speaking <italic>cheilev</italic>, for if that were so, the kidneys and the lobe on the liver [which are not <italic>cheilev</italic>] would not be offered up in the case of the sin-offering. Rather, the intention of the verse is that he is to take away the <italic>cheilev</italic> together with all the things that are removed from the peace-offerings. Similarly, [the verse stating in the case of the she-lamb brought as a sin-offering], <italic>And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn275">275</xref></sup> means that he is to take away as he had done in the case of the peace-offerings, meaning everything that he had taken away there, including the tail with its fat. Similarly, <italic>And they put the &#x2018;chalavim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>fats</italic>) <italic>upon the breasts, and he caused the fats to ascend in fumes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn276">276</xref></sup> means [the <italic>cheilev</italic>] together with all that is removed from them.</p>
<p>I have had to discuss this point at length in order to shut up the mouths of the Sadducees,<sup><xref rid="fn277">277</xref></sup> may their name be erased [from memory], for in matters of Torah it has been said, <italic>Answer a fool according to his folly</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn278">278</xref></sup> and the Rabbis have also said,<sup><xref rid="fn279">279</xref></sup> &#x201C;Be diligent in learning Torah, in order to<sup><xref rid="fn280">280</xref></sup> be able to answer the unbeliever.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Gaon Rav Saadia<sup><xref rid="fn281">281</xref></sup> explained it to them,<sup><xref rid="fn282">282</xref></sup> by saying that <italic>chelbo ha&#x2019;alyah</italic> is missing a connective <italic>vav</italic>, which would make it: <italic>chelbo veha&#x2019;alyah</italic> &#x2014; (its fat &#x201C;and&#x201D; the tail) [thus clearly meaning that the tail is not included in the <italic>cheilev</italic>]. But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra refuted Rav Saadia Gaon by saying [that &#x201C;from a grammatical point of view this could not be possible, for if so] it should have said <italic>chelbo elyato</italic><sup><xref rid="fn283">283</xref></sup> or <italic>hacheilev ha&#x2019;alyah</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn284">284</xref></sup> But Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s refutation is not valid, for we find [Scripture stating], <italic>And all Israel and their elders, and officers, and their judges</italic>&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn285">285</xref></sup> I will yet mention<sup><xref rid="fn286">286</xref></sup> a great mistake which Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra made in his arguments with them [i.e., the Karaites], in which he spoke more wrongly than they.<sup><xref rid="fn287">287</xref></sup> However, the Gaon&#x2019;s interpretation is not correct,<sup><xref rid="fn288">288</xref></sup> and surely it is not an argument sufficiently persuasive to permit the eating [of the tail because of it]. But the interpretation which our Rabbis advanced<sup><xref rid="fn289">289</xref></sup> on the verse, <italic>Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn290">290</xref></sup> that He prohibited only [that kind of fat like] the fat of the ox which is common to all [i.e., the sheep and the goat, thus excepting the fat of the tail of the sheep, which is not found in the ox], that is a proper interpretation [from which we may clearly know that the tail is permitted to be eaten]&#x0021; But in order not to give contestants an occasion to dispute [the tradition of the Rabbis], we have had to bring the [other] proofs and arguments which we have written.</p>
<p>12. AND IF HIS OFFERING BE A GOAT. He mentions here the species, thus meaning, &#x201C;if of the species of goats is his offering,&#x201D; [and thus includes male and female]. This is like the opinion of Onkelos who translated: &#x201C;and if of the &#x2018;<italic>bnei</italic>&#x2019; (species of) the goats is his offering.&#x201D; Similarly, that which He said in connection with the burnt-offering, <italic>whether of the sheep, or of the goats</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn291">291</xref></sup> also means of their species [for since the male of the goats is called <italic>tayish</italic>, the verse there which speaks of a burnt-offering which can be only a male, must perforce mean &#x201C;the species of the goats,&#x201D; which automatically includes the males].</p>
<p>In my opinion<sup><xref rid="fn292">292</xref></sup> the Sacred Language is not particular as to the names of animals, for the majority of them have the same name for both male and female, such as camel, ass, rock-badger, hare, and swine, and among the birds the young pigeon and the turtle-dove. Even among the species which do have different names for the male and female &#x2014; such as <italic>shor</italic> and <italic>parah</italic> (ox and cow), <italic>kesev, kisbah</italic> (he-lamb, ewe-lamb), <italic>tayish</italic> and <italic>eiz</italic> (he-goat and she-goat) &#x2014; Scripture is not particular, and will sometimes say <italic>seh</italic> and <italic>shor</italic> of the female, similar to that which is written, &#x2018;<italic>V&#x2019;shor o seh</italic>&#x2019; [literally: &#x201C;and ox or lamb] <italic>ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn293">293</xref></sup> which applies only to the dam and the lamb [it being permissible to slaughter the male parent and its young in one day], in accordance with the opinion of the Sage who says<sup><xref rid="fn294">294</xref></sup> that [in animals] one does not take into consideration the seed of the male parent. Similarly, <italic>of &#x2018;ha&#x2019;izim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the goats</italic>) <italic>for a burnt-offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn291">291</xref></sup> means of the <italic>t&#x2019;yashim</italic> (the he-goats). <italic>And if his offering be an &#x2018;eiz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a goat</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn295">295</xref></sup> means a male or female [since a peace-offering, which is the subject of this verse, can be brought either from the male or the femals]. So also, <italic>And if his means suffice not for a &#x2018;seh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>lamb</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn296">296</xref></sup> means <italic>a ewe-lamb or a she-goat</italic> [as is expressly stated there in the preceding verse].<sup><xref rid="fn297">297</xref></sup></p>
<h1>4</h1>
<p>2. IF A SOUL SHALL SIN IN ERROR. Since the process of thinking is centered in the soul, and it is the soul which commits the error,<sup><xref rid="fn298">298</xref></sup> Scripture mentions here <italic>nefesh</italic> (soul). The reason for the offerings for the erring soul is that all sins [even if committed unwittingly] produce a particular &#x201C;stain&#x201D; upon the soul and constitute a blemish thereon, and the soul is only worthy to be received by the countenance of its Creator when it is pure of all sin. Were it not so, then all the fools of the world would be deserving to come before Him. It is for this reason that the erring soul brings an offering, through which it becomes worthy of approaching <italic>unto G-d who gave it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn299">299</xref></sup> It is on account of this that Scripture mentions here <italic>nefesh</italic> (soul). Our Rabbis have interpreted:<sup><xref rid="fn300">300</xref></sup> &#x201C; &#x2018;<italic>Nefesh</italic>&#x2019; (A soul) &#x2014; this [word is used to] include proselytes and slaves&#x201D; [thus teaching us that they too are under the obligation of bringing this offering, since the term <italic>nefesh</italic> is inclusive of them as well].</p>
<p>Now in the case of the sin-offering of the anointed priest [first discussed here in Verses 3-12], He does not say &#x201C;and [the priest] shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven,&#x201D; as He mentions in the case of other sinners &#x2014; namely, the whole congregation,<sup><xref rid="fn301">301</xref></sup> the prince,<sup><xref rid="fn302">302</xref></sup> and the common man.<sup><xref rid="fn303">303</xref></sup> Perhaps the reason for this is that due to his great importance he cannot obtain atonement nor be forgiven completely until he prays and beseeches his G-d, <italic>for he is the messenger of the Eternal of hosts</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn304">304</xref></sup> and he must be of clean and pure hands [so that he can never be reproached with anything; hence in addition to the offering he must bring, he must also pray especially for forgiveness].</p>
<p>Scripture does not mention here, when speaking about the bulls which were to be entirely burnt,<sup><xref rid="fn305">305</xref></sup> that the burning of those portions offered on the altar is &#x201C;of a pleasing odor,&#x201D; or that it is &#x201C;a fire-offering unto the Eternal.&#x201D; The reason for this is that since part of them is burnt outside [the camp of Israel], it is therefore not for &#x201C;the fire unto the Eternal.&#x201D; In the case of the goat of the prince [which he brings as his sin-offering],<sup><xref rid="fn306">306</xref></sup> He mentioned &#x201C;atonement&#x201D; [<italic>and the priest shall make atonement for him</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn307">307</xref></sup> but did not state that it is &#x201C;a fire-offering, of a pleasing odor unto the Eternal,&#x201D; because the offering is a <italic>sa&#x2019;ir</italic> (a goat).<sup><xref rid="fn308">308</xref></sup> In the case of the sin-offering of the common person, He mentions that it is <italic>for a pleasing odor unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn309">309</xref></sup> but does not mention &#x201C;a fire-offering,&#x201D; for it is self-understood that it is such, since the whole purpose of the fire-offering is to the Eternal. The student learned [in the mystic lore of the Cabala] will understand.</p>
<p>14. WHEN THE SIN WHEREIN THEY HAVE SINNED IS KNOWN [THEN THE ASSEMBLY SHALL OFFER A YOUNG BULLOCK &#x2026;]. It is self-understood that they cannot offer a sin-offering until they know that they have sinned. [So why does Scripture mention it?] But it is a linguistic expression of the [Hebrew] language to say, &#x201C;and when it becomes known to them that they have sinned, they should bring their offering.&#x201D; Therefore He did not mention it [in Verse 3] in the case of the anointed priest, because there was no need for it. It is possible that [the reason why the verse says, <italic>when their sin wherein they have sinned is known</italic>, is not merely as a linguistic expression but to indicate] that the assembly is not obliged to bring this sin-offering unless they have definite knowledge of their sin but not if it is merely a doubt, as in the case of the suspensive guilt-offering.<sup><xref rid="fn310">310</xref></sup> Our Rabbis have interpreted,<sup><xref rid="fn311">311</xref></sup> [that the verse says, <italic>the sin &#x2026; is known</italic>, to teach that] &#x201C;if the court knew that they had given an [incorrect] decision [on one of two kinds of forbidden food, such as fat and blood, declaring that one of them may be eaten], but did not know which one it was that they permitted, [and the people had eaten both], I might think that the court is obligated to bring a sin-offering [as they usually are when they give an incorrect decision which the people followed]. Scripture therefore says, <italic>when &#x2018;the&#x2019; sin wherein they have sinned is known</italic> &#x2014; not when only the sinners are known.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn312">312</xref></sup> This is not mentioned in the case [of the sin-offering] of the anointed priest, since He said there: <italic>If the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn313">313</xref></sup> thus declaring [the law of the sin-offering of] the anointed priest to be like that of the public.</p>
<p>22. &#x2018;ASHER&#x2019; A PRINCE SINNETH. &#x201C;The word <italic>asher</italic> is [here] derived from the expression <italic>ashrei</italic> (happy). Happy is the generation whose prince brings an offering for atonement [even] for his error.<sup><xref rid="fn314">314</xref></sup> [Torath Kohanim].<sup><xref rid="fn315">315</xref></sup> 23. &#x2018;O&#x2019; HIS SIN BE KNOWN TO HIM &#x2014; &#x2018;if&#x2019; his sin be known to him. There are many verses where the word <italic>o</italic> (or) is used in the sense of <italic>im</italic> (if), and conversely where <italic>im</italic> is used in the sense of <italic>o</italic>. Similarly, <italic>&#x2018;o&#x2019; it be known that the ox was wont to gore</italic><sup><xref rid="fn316">316</xref></sup> [means &#x2018;if&#x2019; it be known, and the word <italic>o</italic> which ordinarily means &#x2018;or&#x2019; is here used in the sense of &#x2018;<italic>im</italic>,&#x2019; meaning &#x2018;if&#x2019;].&#x201D; Thus the language of Rashi.</p>
<p>Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: &#x201C;The sense of <italic>asher nasi yechta</italic> is as if the expression were inverted, making it read: <italic>asher yechta nasi</italic> (if &#x2018;he who sins is the prince&#x2019;), and it is connected with [the section] above, <italic>And if the whole congregation of Israel shall err</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn317">317</xref></sup> It is thus as if He had stated here: &#x2018;and if he who sins is the prince [and he knows it of himself], or his sin be made known to him by others.&#x2019; Scripture, however, adopts a short form of expression, [omitting to state &#x2018;that he knows the sin himself,&#x2019; or that it was made known to him &#x2018;through others&#x2019;], but the meaning is that either it becomes known to the prince by himself that he sinned, &#x2018;<italic>o hoda eilav</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>or it be made known to him</italic>) &#x2014; i.e., that another man who saw him doing it informed him of it. The grammatical form of <italic>hoda</italic> is then a past causative [like <italic>hodi&#x2019;a</italic> &#x2014; a man &#x2018;informed&#x2019; him], this being similar to &#x2018;<italic>v&#x2019;heitzar lecha</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn318">318</xref></sup> [the meaning of which is as if it said &#x2018;<italic>v&#x2019;heitzir lecha</italic>&#x2019; in the causative, i.e., <italic>and he will besiege thee</italic>]. The subject, however, is missing [for it should have said here, or &#x2018;another man&#x2019; inform him, and there it should have stated, and &#x2018;the enemy&#x2019; will besiege thee], just as &#x2018;<italic>asher&#x2019; bore her to Levi</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn319">319</xref></sup> [which should have read &#x2018;<italic>asher ishto</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>whose wife</italic>) <italic>bore her to Levi</italic>]. [All these are the words of Ibn Ezra.].</p>
<p>But there is no need for all this, since the uses of the word <italic>asher</italic> are many. In some cases it indicates time, such as: &#x2018;<italic>ka&#x2019;asher</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>when</italic>) <italic>Joseph came unto his brethren;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn320">320</xref></sup> &#x2018;<italic>ka&#x2019;asher</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>when</italic>) <italic>they had eaten up the corn</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn321">321</xref></sup> and the like. Similarly, here too [<italic>asher</italic> is like <italic>ka&#x2019;asher</italic> and indicates time]: &#x2018;<italic>when&#x2019; a prince sinneth</italic>, with the <italic>kaf</italic> of cognizance [which would make it <italic>ka&#x2019;asher</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;when&#x201D;] missing. So also, <italic>The blessing, &#x2018;asher&#x2019; ye shall hearken unto the commandments of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn322">322</xref></sup> means &#x2018;<italic>ka&#x2019;asher</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>when</italic>) <italic>ye shall hearken. &#x2018;Asher&#x2019; ye have seen the Egyptians today, ye shall see them again no more</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn323">323</xref></sup> means &#x2018;<italic>ka&#x2019;asher</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>when</italic>) <italic>ye have seen them</italic> [today ye shall see them no more]. <italic>Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread &#x2018;asher&#x2019; I commanded thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn324">324</xref></sup> means &#x2018;<italic>ka&#x2019;asher</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>when</italic>) <italic>I commanded thee</italic>. At times this word [<italic>asher</italic>] is missing [not a <italic>kaf</italic> but] a <italic>beth</italic>. Thus: <italic>And also Maacah his mother he</italic> [King Asa of Judah] <italic>removed from being queen, &#x2018;asher&#x2019; she made an abominable image for an Asherah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn325">325</xref></sup> means <italic>&#x2018;ba&#x2019;asher&#x2019; she made an abominable image for an Asherah</italic>, which denotes &#x201C;because,&#x201D; just like, &#x2018;<italic>ba&#x2019;asher&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>because</italic>) <italic>thou art his wife</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn326">326</xref></sup> The expression <italic>o hoda eilav</italic> [is thus not a causative, as Ibn Ezra would have it, which would make it to mean &#x201C;or that it was made known to him by another person; &#x201D; rather, it] refers to the guilt, stating that when a person will <italic>do any one of all the things which the Eternal his G-d hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn327">327</xref></sup> and deserving of punishment, or it be known to him and he will achieve atonement by means of an offering. The sense of the verse is thus: &#x201C;he will either be guilty [and deserving of punishment], or bring an offering and he will be forgiven.&#x201D; The reason for the expression: <italic>the Eternal his G-d</italic>, is to state that even though he is the king, and the lord upon whom there is no fear of mortal man, he is yet to fear <italic>the Eternal his G-d</italic>, for it is He who is <italic>the Lord of lords</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn328">328</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>that he</italic> (the king) <italic>may learn to fear the Eternal his G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn329">329</xref></sup> means that the king is to take to heart [the knowledge] that there is a Supreme One above him, Who is his G-d and in Whose power is his life and kingdom.</p>
<p>25. AND THE REMAINING BLOOD THEREOF SHALL HE POUR OUT AT THE BASE OF THE ALTAR OF BURNT-OFFERING. This is the same altar already mentioned [in the first part of the verse: <italic>and he shall put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering</italic>]. But such is the linguistic expression of the [Hebrew] language to mention the subject instead of [merely] the definite article [thus repeating &#x201C;of burnt-offering&#x201D; rather than just saying &#x201C;the altar&#x201D;]. Similarly, <italic>and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and he shall slaughter the bullock</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn330">330</xref></sup> Our Rabbis have Midrashic interpretations on these verses, for <italic>the law of the Eternal is perfect</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn331">331</xref></sup> there being nothing in it which is omitted or redundant.</p>
<h1>5</h1>
<p>1. AND HE IS A WITNESS, WHETHER HE HATH SEEN OR KNOWN<sup><xref rid="fn332">332</xref></sup> These are not three separate matters, for it is impossible that one be a witness without seeing and knowing. Rather, Scripture is stating that if one <italic>hear the voice of adjuration</italic> that a party to a law-suit adjures him, concerning a matter in which he is a witness either by seeing or knowing of it, <italic>if he does not tell it</italic> he has committed an iniquity. Now the witness is not obligated to bring this offering unless he knows such a testimony that the party in suit who adjured him [to give witness] would have legally won his case because of it [and the witness nonetheless withheld his evidence]. It is for this reason that our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn333">333</xref></sup> interpreted [on the basis of the verse before us] that there is testimony which is valid by seeing without knowing, and [testimony which is valid] by knowing without seeing. How so? [Reuben says to Shimon:] &#x201C;I have delivered to thee a maneh<sup><xref rid="fn334">334</xref></sup> [as a loan] in the presence of such-and-such persons,&#x201D; and [Shimon] claims &#x201C;this never happened,<sup><xref rid="fn335">335</xref></sup> let the witnesses [you claim to have], come and testify.&#x201D; This is a case of seeing without knowing [since although they saw Reuben handing the money to Shimon, they do not know the nature of this delivery, whether it was as a loan, or repayment of a loan that Shimon had originally made to him].<sup><xref rid="fn336">336</xref></sup> [If Reuben says to Shimon:] &#x201C;You have admitted to owing me a maneh,<sup><xref rid="fn334">334</xref></sup> in the presence of such-and-such persons,&#x201D; [and Shimon replies]: &#x201C;let them come and testify,&#x201D; this is a case of knowing without seeing [and even though they did not see, they must testify what they know, and hence are liable if they withhold their evidence].</p>
<p>But in line with the plain meaning of Scripture, we need not [explain] the &#x201C;seeing&#x201D; here [to mean seeing] without knowing. Rather, the sense of the verse is as follows: <italic>whether he hath seen</italic>, meaning that he saw the loan or the sale completely [i.e., with knowledge], <italic>or known</italic>, i.e., that he heard [the defendants to the suit] admitting that transaction in the presence of witnesses, but he did not see it.</p>
<p>Now He does not state here: &#x201C;and it is hidden from him,&#x201D; [as He does in the following verse], because in this case [where the witness swears that he knows of no testimony for the party that adjures him to come and testify before the court], he is obligated to bring the offering [mentioned here in these verses] whether he swore [entirely] wilfully, or was in error on the oath whilst wilfully denying his knowledge of evidence. If, however, at the time of giving the oath he had forgotten the testimony, there is no guilt upon him.</p>
<p>2. AND IT IS HIDDEN FROM HIM<sup><xref rid="fn337">337</xref></sup> &#x2014; &#x201C;that is, he had forgotten his state of uncleanness. AND HE INCURRED GUILT &#x2014; by eating holy food or by entering the Sanctuary.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Now [Rashi&#x2019;s] intent is not that the [requirement of] eating the holy food or entering the Sanctuary is derived from the word <italic>v&#x2019;asheim</italic> (and he incurred guilt), for this word is used with reference to all the sin-offerings mentioned previously.<sup><xref rid="fn338">338</xref></sup> But this section deals in a brief manner with those points which are self-understood. For there is no sin involved in touching a carcass of an unclean beast or swarming thing [which defiles the person]. Even the priests have not been warned against it. So it is impossible that Scripture should require a person to bring an offering just because he touched them and thereby became defiled. Rather, Scripture is stating that when a person becomes defiled and forgets his state of uncleanness, or when he swears [an &#x201C;oath of utterance&#x201D;]<sup><xref rid="fn337">337</xref></sup> and forgets the oath, and he incurs guilt by violating it &#x2014; for either of these sins committed through forgetfulness, he is required to bring an offering. Now it is self-understood that the mere forgetfulness of his state of uncleanness involves no sin, except [if in that state] he ate holy food or entered the Sanctuary. Nor is there any sin in the mere forgetfulness of an oath, except if he violated it. This is the literal explanation of the verses in this section. Our Rabbis have further interpretations on this section strengthening this explanation.</p>
<p>5. AND HE SHALL CONFESS THAT WHEREIN HE HATH SINNED. 6. AND HE SHALL BRING HIS GUILT-OFFERING. This was not the [order of the] procedure.<sup><xref rid="fn339">339</xref></sup> Rather, he first brought the sin-offering and laid his hands upon it, and then confessed, similarly to that which is [explicitly] said further on, <italic>And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn340">340</xref></sup> Here, however, Scripture does not state &#x201C;and he shall lay his hand,&#x201D; because He explained previously in the case of all sin-offerings<sup><xref rid="fn341">341</xref></sup> that they require the laying of hands, and similarly, in the case of freewill offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn342">342</xref></sup> But He did not explain [the duty of] confession above in the case of the other sin-offerings, [although it is required in those cases as well].</p>
<p>In line with the simple meaning of Scripture it would appear that here He said <italic>and he shall confess</italic>, because in the case of an &#x201C;oath of testimony&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn332">332</xref></sup> the offering is to be brought even if the oath was taken wilfully. So also in the case of an &#x201C;oath of deposit&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn343">343</xref></sup> He mentioned, <italic>then they shall confess their sin which they have done</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn344">344</xref></sup> But in the case of the sin-offering brought for transgression in error, He did not mention confession.<sup><xref rid="fn345">345</xref></sup> But in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn346">346</xref></sup> the expression, <italic>and he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned</italic>, refers to everything mentioned in this section, including the defiling of the Sanctuary and the holy food, and an &#x201C;oath of utterance,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn337">337</xref></sup> which offerings have to be brought [only] when [the sins are] committed in error, and [in the case of] all other sin-offerings [which are also brought only when the transgression was done in error, the need for confession when bringing them] is derived from here. He mentioned confession, however, [specifically] here because the &#x201C;oath of testimony&#x201D; and the &#x201C;oath of utterance&#x201D; do not make one liable to excision [if done wilfully, unlike the sin-offering which is brought only for those sins committed in error which, if committed wilfully, incur the punishment of excision], and yet He requires confession in these cases, and [thus it follows] all the more that in the case of the fixed<sup><xref rid="fn347">347</xref></sup> sin-offerings mentioned above, he must confess [since his sin, were it to be committed wilfully, would incur] the penalty of excision. Our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn348">348</xref></sup> that the expression here, <italic>and he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned</italic> is a general principle in the case of all sin-offerings, that they require confession. The verses written in the section of <italic>Naso</italic>, stating, <italic>and that soul shall be guilty. Then they shall confess their sin which they have done</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn349">349</xref></sup> is to include all guilt-offerings [in the requirement of confession]. So it is explained in the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn348">348</xref></sup> There the Rabbis have interpreted: &#x201C;<italic>And that soul shall be guilty. Then they shall confess</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn349">349</xref></sup> This establishes the general rule for all those executed [by the court] that they require confession&#x201D; [to achieve full forgiveness of their sin].</p>
<p>7. AND IF HIS MEANS SUFFICE NOT FOR A LAMB. Scripture has been lenient towards these sinners by allowing them to bring an offering of either higher or lower value. It is possible that the reason for the leniency with regard to the offering in the case of oaths [i.e., the &#x201C;oath of testimony&#x201D; and the &#x201C;oath of utterance&#x201D;, as explained above] is because the punishment is not excision [were they to be done wilfully]. In the case of defilement of the Sanctuary and the holy food [He mitigated the obligation of the offering] because the person who did it erred whilst engaged in performing a religious duty, for the priest who eats the holy food or enters into the Sanctuary to prostrate himself or to bring an offering is engaged in performing a religious duty, and his intention is towards Heaven. Therefore even though he sinned on account of having forgotten his state of uncleanness, Scripture gave him more ways of atonement.</p>
<p>Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that the reason why one [of the two birds brought by the poor man in the offering of higher or lower value] was a burnt-offering, is so that it should be offered on the altar in lieu of the fats of the animal sin-offering [brought by the affluent person].<sup><xref rid="fn350">350</xref></sup> He has explained it well.</p>
<p>15. AND HE SHALL BRING &#x2018;ASHAMO&#x2019; (HIS GUILT-OFFERING) UNTO THE ETERNAL. This offering is called <italic>asham</italic> (&#x201C;guilt-offering&#x201D; &#x2014; as distinguished from the sin-offering), just as He has said [here in the verse] <italic>after the shekel of the Sanctuary, for a guilt-offering</italic>. But <italic>he shall bring &#x2018;ashamo&#x2019; unto the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn351">351</xref></sup> mentioned above in the case of the offering of higher and lower value means, &#x201C;and he shall bring his offering unto the Eternal,&#x201D; for that offering was a sin-offering, as He said, <italic>a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn351">351</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now it has not been explained why the name of one offering is &#x201C;a sin-offering,&#x201D; and that of the other, &#x201C;a guilt-offering,&#x201D; since they both come to effect atonement for sin&#x0021; We cannot say that the reason is since the sin-offering is a female [unlike the guilt-offering which is male, and therefore the word <italic>asham</italic> which is masculine cannot be applied to the female sin-offering], for there are sin-offerings which are male &#x2014; namely the goats [brought as sin-offerings in case of the public worshipping idols,<sup><xref rid="fn352">352</xref></sup> or the usual sin-offering of the prince],<sup><xref rid="fn352">352</xref></sup> and the bullocks [brought by the anointed priest as a sin-offering,<sup><xref rid="fn353">353</xref></sup> as well as his bullock on the Day of Atonement].<sup><xref rid="fn353">353</xref></sup> Again, it cannot be said that [the guilt-offering is so called] on account of the severity of the sin [for which it is brought], for behold, the leper brings two offerings &#x2014; the name of one being &#x201C;the sin-offering&#x201D; and the name of the other, the &#x201C;guilt-offering&#x0021;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn354">354</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears to me that the term <italic>asham</italic> denotes some serious deeds for which the person who did it deserves to be <italic>shameim</italic> (ruined) and destroyed because of it, similar to the expressions: &#x2018;<italic>ha&#x2019;ashimeim</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>destroy them</italic>), <italic>O G-d;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn355">355</xref></sup> the pastures of the wilderness waste away.<sup><xref rid="fn356">356</xref></sup> So also: &#x2018;<italic>Te&#x2019;sham Shomron</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>Samaria shall be laid waste</italic>), <italic>for she hath rebelled against her G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn357">357</xref></sup> and <italic>we are &#x2018;asheimim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn358">358</xref></sup> &#x2014; means &#x201C;we are being punished.&#x201D; The word <italic>chatath</italic> (sin) denotes something which has turned aside off the way, this being of the expression, <italic>every one could sling stones at a hair-breadth and not &#x2018;yachti&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>miss</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn359">359</xref></sup> Now the guilt-offering for robberies,<sup><xref rid="fn360">360</xref></sup> and the guilt-offering for carnally knowing a handmaid already promised in marriage<sup><xref rid="fn361">361</xref></sup> would then be called <italic>asham</italic> [indicating a serious sin] because they have to be brought even for wilful commission of the sin. So also the <italic>asham</italic> (guilt-offering) of the Nazirite [which he brings for becoming defiled by a dead body, even if his defilement was caused wilfully,<sup><xref rid="fn362">362</xref></sup> and is therefore deserving to be <italic>shameim</italic> &#x2014; destroyed]. The guilt-offering for misusing sanctified objects,<sup><xref rid="fn363">363</xref></sup> however, even though it is brought only when the sin was committed in error, yet because it concerns <italic>the holy things of the Eternal</italic>, it is called <italic>asham</italic>, because the great sin that he did makes him deserve to be <italic>shameim</italic> (destroyed) because of it, even as it is called <italic>me&#x2019;ilah</italic> (treachery).<sup><xref rid="fn364">364</xref></sup> The reason for the name [<italic>asham</italic>] of the leper&#x2019;s offering<sup><xref rid="fn365">365</xref></sup> is because a leper is regarded as dead,<sup><xref rid="fn366">366</xref></sup> and thus he is <italic>shameim</italic> (ruined) and destroyed. The leper&#x2019;s first offering, then,<sup><xref rid="fn365">365</xref></sup> is called <italic>asham</italic> in order to protect him from the guilt for which he is &#x201C;ruined,&#x201D; and the second is the sin-offering which effects atonement for his errors.</p>
<p>The reason for the suspensive guilt-offering<sup><xref rid="fn367">367</xref></sup> is because the owner thinks that he is not liable to be punished [since his sin has not been confirmed]; therefore Scripture was more severe with him in the case of his doubt than in that of certainty [of sin], requiring him to bring a ram of the value of <italic>shekels of silver</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn368">368</xref></sup> whilst if the sin is confirmed, he brings a sin-offering which could be worth only a <italic>danka</italic> [a small Persian coin &#x2014; the sixth of a <italic>denar</italic>]. Scripture calls it <italic>asham</italic> in order to say that it must be worth two <italic>s&#x2019;laim</italic> just like the graver guilt-offerings [i.e., like the guilt-offering brought for appropriating sanctified objects, and that brought for carnally knowing a handmaid already promised in marriage, which must be worth at least two <italic>s&#x2019;laim</italic>], thus indicating to the sinner [since he is in doubt as to whether he has sinned], that if he treats it lightly and will not bring his [offering for] atonement, he will be destroyed by his sin. This is the sense of the verse, &#x2018;<italic>Asham hu, ashom asham lashem</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>It is a guilt-offering &#x2014; he hath surely incurred guilt before the Eternal</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn369">369</xref></sup> That is to say, although this offering is brought only on a doubtful sin, <italic>it is a guilt-offering</italic>, for he has surely incurred guilt before the Eternal Who knows all hidden things, and if indeed he did sin before Him, He will requite him. Similarly, that which He said above, <italic>and he shall bring his guilt-offering</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn370">370</xref></sup> is because among those sins mentioned above are also those which require the bringing of an offering even when they are committed wilfully, such as for the &#x201C;oath of testimony; &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn332">332</xref></sup> therefore He mentions the term <italic>asham</italic> with reference to them although the offering is called a sin-offering.</p>
<p>Also by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], a female offering for a sin is called <italic>chatath</italic> (sin-offering), and the male offering is called <italic>asham</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn371">371</xref></sup> The goats<sup><xref rid="fn352">352</xref></sup> and the bullocks<sup><xref rid="fn353">353</xref></sup> [even though they are male] are also called <italic>chatath</italic> (sin-offering), because they are brought [as an atonement] for sin.</p>

<ftnote id="fn43">(43) Accordingly, the call to Moses that is mentioned at the beginning of this book was not for the purpose of giving him permission to come into the Tent of Meeting, but rather to express G-d&#x2019;s affection for Moses and His inspiriting him for the communication. If so, it stands to reason, Ramban continues, that this kind of call [&#x201C;Moses, Moses&#x201D;] came to him on all occasions when he received a Divine communication. The reason why it is mentioned specifically here, etc. (see text).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn44">(44) For since the purpose of the call was not to give permission to Moses to enter, but rather to show him affection, the sense of the verse may then be explained as follows: &#x201C;and G-d called him out of the Tent and He spoke to him in the Tent&#x201D; where he already was.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn50">(50) When there was a lack of private offerings [due to the long summer days], freewill burnt-offerings were supplied from the surplus of the half-shekels of the previous year.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn54">(54) Peace-offerings of the public were only brought on the Festival of Shevuoth (see further, 23:19).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn55">(55) In other words, the freewill public burnt-offering for the altar&#x2019;s summertime need not be limited exclusively to that brought out of the surplus in the baskets containing the previous year&#x2019;s shekels. Money may be collected originally from the public for the purpose of bringing a freewill offering, and the offering will have the status of a public-offering in the sense that [like a public burnt-offering] it will not need the laying of hands on it, which is required in the case of an individual offering. Thus Ramban differs from Rashi&#x2019;s opinion above that even the combination of a large group of individuals does not alter the status of the offering, which remains an offering of individual partners. Or it may be that Ramban means that even according to Rashi, if the community agreed beforehand, and the money was not left to be donated individually, but collected in the same way that the <italic>shekalim</italic> were collected, it thereby gains the status of a public-offering. Hence Ramban&#x2019;s expression: &#x201C;We may possibly say&#x201D;, i.e., in explanation of Rashi.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn58">(58) I.e., the word &#x201C;hands&#x201D; does not refer to &#x201C;Aaron and his sons,&#x201D; thus implying that each lay one hand, but to each individual laying his two hands on the offering. The source of this interpretation is unknown to me.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn63">(63) The Torah cites no punishment for failure to fulfill a positive commandment [with the two exceptions of not slaughtering the Passover-offering, and not being circumcised]. If a person thus failed to fulfill a positive commandment &#x2014; such as dwelling in a booth on the Festival of Succoth &#x2014; his bringing a freewill burnt-offering effects atonement for this sin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn64">(64) A case in point is the prohibition against taking an entire bird&#x2019;s nest, with the mother-bird and its young (Deuteronomy 22:6). If, however, he did infringe upon the law, he is obliged to observe a positive commandment that the Torah stated next to the prohibition &#x2014; <italic>Thou shalt in any wise let the dam go</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic>, Verse 7). Hence the usual punishment of stripes is not incurred for infringing the negative commandment, since the positive commandment &#x201C;remedies&#x201D; the prohibition. Yet it needs atonement, and the bringing of the burnt-offering expiates for it. &#x2014; It is important to note that during the laying of hands on the offering the owner, in case of sin-offerings, confessed the sin for which he brought the offering, and so also in the case of guilt-offerings. Similarly, on bringing a burnt-offering he confessed the transgression for a positive commandment etc. [as explained here in the text]. In the case of the peace-offering, he uttered words of praise to G-d (Mishneh Torah, <italic>Hilchoth Ma&#x2019;asei Korbanoth</italic> 3:14-15).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn65">(65) Beraitha (literally: &#x201C;outside&#x201D;) is a teaching or tradition of the Tannaim that had been excluded from the Mishnah and incorporated in other collections. The Tosephta, Mechilta, Sifra (Torath Kohanim), and Sifre contain these Beraithoth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn66">(66) Torath Kohanim <italic>Vayikra</italic> 4:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn67">(67) &#x201C;Punishments&#x201D; [such as &#x201C;excision etc.&#x201D;] are incurred only for <italic>wilful</italic> violation of the negative commandments, while offerings for atonement are brought only for <italic>unwilful</italic> violations. So how could Rashi state, &#x201C;Should you say [that the freewill burnt-offering is brought] for such sins that make one liable to excision etc., the punishment for those sins has already been stated&#x201D;? Where are those &#x201C;punishments&#x201D; for <italic>unwilful</italic> violations mentioned? For <italic>unwilful</italic> violations no punishments are ever incurred&#x0021;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn68">(68) The general rule is that a sin-offering is brought only for such a sin unwilfully committed for which the penalty if committed wilfully would be excision. Ramban is thus suggesting: we could say that the freewill burnt-offering atones for those unwilful sins for which the penalty is death by the hands of Heaven etc., and for all those sins for which the penalty is death by the court and yet do <italic>not</italic> require the bringing of a sin-offering for unwilful violation. Examples follow in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn69">(69) The reason why the sin-offering is not brought for the unwilful violation of these negative commandments is that the punishment of excision is not incurred in case of the wilful violation thereof. See Note 68 above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn70">(70) Thus Scripture made it clear that in the case of those sins for which the penalty is death by the hands of Heaven or stripes if committed wilfully &#x2014; no offering for expiation is needed when committed unintentionally. Rashi and the Torath Kohanim were thus correct in stating that the burnt-offering could not effect atonement for these unwilful sins, since &#x201C;the punishments&#x201D; have already been stated in Scripture both for wilful and unwilful sins, and therefore we could not say that the burnt-offering effects atonement for the above-mentioned sins if committed unwilfully.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn73">(73) The Agadah (homily) comprises all subjects in Rabbinical literature which do not aim directly at the exposition of the <italic>laws</italic> of the Torah, but which teach and edify on all subjects concerning the Torah. The Agadic literature is contained primarily in the Midrashim, as well as in the Talmud. It would appear that Ramban uses the term Agadah here in contradistinction to the Torath Kohanim previously mentioned, which is primarily a book of <italic>Halachah</italic> (law). There in the Torath Kohanim the purpose of the burnt-offering is as explained above; in the Agadah &#x2014; in Vayikra Rabbah &#x2014; it is assigned another purpose, as explained further on.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn74">(74) Vayikra Rabbah 7:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn75">(75) The Hebrew term for the burnt-offering is <italic>olah</italic> [literally, &#x201C;comes up&#x201D;]. There is thus here a suggestion that the <italic>olah</italic> is for those sinful thoughts &#x201C;which come into one&#x2019;s mind.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn78">(78) Up to here we have followed Silberman&#x2019;s translation of the phrase: &#x201C;and it shall be favorably accepted for him.&#x201D; Ramban now suggests three new interpretations: 1) &#x201C;and he will be favorably accepted by Him.&#x201D; 2) &#x201C;and the sin will be completed to him&#x201D; &#x2014; never to be mentioned again. 3) &#x201C;and it will be &#x2018;agreeable&#x2019; to Him.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn84">(84) Ramban understood Rashi as saying that the word <italic>v&#x2019;hikrivu</italic> has a primary meaning of &#x201C;receiving&#x201D; the blood in a vessel, which is the first process after the &#x201C;slaughtering&#x201D; mentioned immediately before in the verse, and a subsidiary meaning [from the root &#x2018;<italic>karav</italic>&#x2019;, to bring near] of &#x201C;bringing&#x201D; it to the altar. To this Ramban objects that &#x2018;<italic>v&#x2019;hikrivu</italic>&#x2019; is not derived from the root &#x2018;<italic>karav</italic>&#x2019;, implying bringing near, and hence cannot sustain the interpretation of &#x201C;bringing it near&#x201D; the altar even as a subsidiary meaning. Rather, it is associated with the word &#x2018;<italic>korban</italic>&#x2019; (offering), and has only one meaning, that of &#x201C;receiving&#x201D; the blood, which is the first stage in offering. If so, whence do we know that bringing it near the altar may also be done only by priests [and is invalid if done by a non-priest]? To this Ramban replies that it is a logical deduction [&#x201C;if receiving the blood may only be done by priests, it follows &#x2018;all the more&#x2019; that bringing it to the altar, which is a later stage in its offering, has this requirement&#x201D;]. A careful reading of Rashi and Ramban clearly indicates this interpretation.</ftnote>

This is the gist of Ramban&#x2019;s argument. It is more readily understood in the light of Ramban&#x2019;s explanation on the development of idolatry in Exodus Chapter 20, Verse 3, which indicates that the early idolators believed in a Supreme G-d.

<ftnote id="fn117">(117) I.e., G-d&#x2019;s intent.

<ftnote id="fn119">(119) This concludes Ramban&#x2019;s array of arguments against Rambam&#x2019;s rationale of the offerings. It is important to point out that many great authors came to Rambam&#x2019;s defense, as there are many Scriptural and Rabbinical sources which seem to confirm his opinion, and the questions Ramban raised have been answered by them. A summary of them will be found in my Hebrew commentary, pp. 11-12. See there also for the unique approach of Rabbi Meir Simcha in harmonizing the theories of both Rambam and Ramban.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn120">(120) The reference is to Ibn Ezra. This is clearly apparent in Ramban&#x2019;s language in his sermon called Torath Hashem Temimah, where he writes: &#x201C;Now the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra on the matter of the offerings is that they are an atonement for the soul. The explanation of the matter on the basis of his opinion is that the offerings &#x2026; &#x201D; (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, p. 164). It is thus clear that what follows is Ramban&#x2019;s interpretation of the way he understood Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s thought. This explains why the following exposition is not found verbatim in Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s writings. See my Hebrew commentary (beginning with the third edition, p. 532).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn121">(121) Sifre, <italic>Pinchas</italic> 143. &#x2014; The Sifre is the Tannaitic Midrash on the Books of Numbers and Deuteronomy. It is equivalent to the Torath Kohanim [or Sifra] on the Book of Leviticus, and the Mechilta on the Book of Exodus.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn123">(123) &#x201C;They will bring proof from the fact that a deity with such-and-such a name commanded that the meal-offering be brought to him, and a deity of another name commanded that the bullocks [be offered to him], and a deity of a third name commanded that the ram [be offered to him]&#x201D; (Rashi <italic>ibid.</italic>), &#x2014; In his work on the Torah &#x201C;Meshech Chochmah&#x201D; (at the beginning of <italic>Seder Shoftim</italic>) Rabbi Meir Simchah explains the intent of Shimon ben Azai&#x2019;s words in the following pertinent way: &#x201C;It is known that the name <italic>Elokim</italic> means Master of all (natural) forces, or the Force of forces (see Ramban, Vol. I, p. 25). Hence if the name <italic>Elokim</italic> or <italic>E-il</italic> had been used in the section of the offerings it would have given an opportunity to the opponents [of the belief in the true Unity of G-d] that He is in need of food [i.e., in need of replenishing His powers]. Therefore only the Tetragrammaton is used in this whole section in order to indicate that His Existence is the only true Existence, and that everything exists only through His true Existence, for they are all in need of Him, but He is not in need of them nor of any of them.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn131">(131) Numbers 28:2. &#x2014; The word <italic>l&#x2019;ishai</italic> [vowelled with a <italic>patach</italic>] means, &#x201C;for My <italic>ishim</italic> &#x2014; fires,&#x201D; as alluded to further on. See also my Hebrew commentary, p. 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn132">(132) Further, 3:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn133">(133) The verse reads: <italic>and the priest shall cause &#x2018;hakol&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>all</italic>) <italic>to ascend in fumes on the altar &#x2018;olah&#x2019;</italic>, (<italic>a burnt-offering</italic>) <italic>&#x2018;isheih&#x2019;</italic> &#x2026; Now the word <italic>isheih</italic> which is in the masculine, is the adjective to the word <italic>hakol</italic> which is also in the masculine, and not to the word <italic>olah</italic> which is in the feminine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn134">(134) Further, 2:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn135">(135) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 3:11. In other words, although here in Verse 9 it is stated <italic>isheih</italic>, and so also in many other places, the word is yet to be understood as <italic>isheh</italic>, which is surely a noun and not an adjectival noun (as Ibn Ezra explained it).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn138">(138) Further, 21:6.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn173">(173) Further, 17:11. Ramban&#x2019;s intention is to defend Rashi&#x2019;s explanation. At first sight, one could suggest an alternative explanation, which would leave the words of the verse in the correct order, namely that the nipping off and burning mentioned in the verse refer to the <italic>head</italic>, and the wringing of the blood can nonetheless be done <italic>subsequently</italic> because it refers to the body&#x2019;s blood. Rashi, however, was compelled to invert the word-order because this suggested explanation is impossible, as explained by Ramban.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn176">(176) Zebachim 65b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn177">(177) Jeremiah 48:9. Here too, the word <italic>natzoh</italic> is derived from the original root meaning &#x201C;feathers&#x201D; &#x2014; hence: &#x201C;she must fly away.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn180">(180) For according to the Sages he removes only the crop but not the entrails.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn181">(181) This proves that Aba Yosei also interprets the word <italic>b&#x2019;notzathah</italic> to mean with &#x201C;its feathers,&#x201D; and not, as Rashi explained it. that Aba Yosei interprets it to mean &#x201C;the place of its digested food, namely the crop.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn182">(182) Ramban is thus saying that Onkelos in translating the Hebrew phrase <italic>muratho b&#x2019;notzathah</italic> as <italic>yath zfokeih b&#x2019;uchleih</italic>, did not put it in the order of the wording of the Hebrew; instead, it is as if he had inverted it and rendered it <italic>yath uchleih bizfokeih</italic>, as the Aramaic <italic>uchleih</italic> is the equivalent of the Hebrew <italic>muratho</italic>, and the Aramaic <italic>bizfokeih</italic> is the equivalent of the Hebrew <italic>b&#x2019;notzathah</italic>, as explained in the text. The reason for this change is, as explained by Ramban, because the food (<italic>muratho</italic>) is only removable by means of taking away the crop (<italic>zfokeih</italic>). Ramban then brings a number of proofs to illustrate that it is Onkelos&#x2019; habit to change the order of the Hebrew wording when it appears better to him to do so.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn200">(200) This explains why the Torah uses here the term <italic>thaktiru</italic>. For since honey is mentioned in the verse, and honey would have improved the scent of the incense, Scripture uses a term which is applicable to the burning of aromatics.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn201">(201) In the words of the Talmud Yerushalmi (Yoma IV, 5): &#x201C;Bar Kappara taught: Druggists in Jerusalem used to say: had the smallest amount of honey been put into the incense no one could have stood its scent.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn216">(216) Verse 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn217">(217) In view of the fact that the salting was done on top of the altar, which no non-priest was allowed to approach, Ramban must mean that if it happened that the non-priest salted it before the offering was taken up to the altar, it need not be salted again. See my Hebrew commentary p. 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn218">(218) Verse 13. The word <italic>korbancha</italic> (<italic>thine offering</italic>) is in the singular. Since this might be interpreted to refer only to the meal-offering mentioned in this verse, Ramban proceeds to explain that it means here &#x201C;offerings&#x201D; in the plural, for all offerings etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn219">(219) During the morning Daily Whole-offering on the seven days of the Festival of Succoth, there was in addition to the regular libation of wine, a libation of water on the altar. The drawing of the water from the fountain of Shiloah was marked by a great public festivity held in the Court of the Sanctuary during the evenings of the festival. They were known as the <italic>Simchath Beth Ha&#x2019;sho&#x2019;evah</italic> (Rejoicing of the Drawing of the Water).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn221">(221) Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s intention in using this phrase [&#x201C;Nor shall it be eaten&#x201D;] is unclear to me. Perhaps he means that the priests when eating the flesh of certain offerings [such as the sin-offering, guilt-offering etc., or the Israelite eating the peace-offering] must salt it, otherwise the food is without flavor and thus they show their contempt for it, as they did not take the effort to prepare it properly.

<ftnote id="fn237">(237) Isaiah 44:28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn238">(238) Deuteronomy 27:6. Since the peace-offering is brought in order to bring peace into the world, it performs the function of harmonizing all attributes, such as justice and mercy. Hence it may be brought from the male or female (Ricanti). See my Hebrew commentary, p. 19; also Note 240 further.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn258">(258) Psalms 63:6. It should be noted that this verse does not contain the root <italic>shuman</italic>, but <italic>deshen</italic>. We must assume then that Ramban considered them equivalent terms. This is strengthened by an examination of the Hebrew wording of the verse: &#x2018;<italic>k&#x2019;mo cheilev vadeshen tisba nafshi</italic>.&#x2019; Now <italic>deshen</italic> is thus in parallelism to <italic>cheilev</italic>; hence <italic>deshen</italic> must here be understood as <italic>shuman</italic>, as explained above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn259">(259) Numbers 18:30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn260">(260) Deuteronomy 32:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn261">(261) Genesis 45:18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn262">(262) Having established the premise that the term <italic>cheilev</italic> has a figurative meaning, Ramban now proceeds to his main theme here: that the tail of the animal contains no <italic>cheilev</italic> [which is the term for the fat which is forbidden to be eaten] at all, but rather it contains <italic>shuman</italic> [which is the fatty substance contained in the meat which cannot be separated from it, and is permitted to be eaten]. At the end of this lengthy discussion it will be made clear that Ramban&#x2019;s intention is to refute a major contention of the Karaites, who prohibited the eating of the fat of the tail, while the true tradition of the Rabbis permits it to be eaten. See further, Note 277.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn263">(263) Ezekiel 24:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn264">(264) The ancients believed that a person&#x2019;s physical and mental constitution is determined by the proper balance of the four bodily fluids which exist in every man. These are &#x201C;the four humors&#x201D; &#x2014; the red, the white, the green, and the black &#x2014; which vary constantly in man and determine his state of health and disposition at any given moment. Since the eating of <italic>cheilev</italic> increases the white fluid beyond the proper proportion, it affects the health of the person adversely.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn265">(265) Further, Verse 17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn266">(266) Ramban&#x2019;s intent is to refer to the following verse: <italic>For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men present an offering unto the Eternal, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people</italic> (further, 7:25). Now the verse does not state &#x201C;For whosoever eateth the fat which men present as an offering &#x2026; &#x201D; [so that you could argue, since the tail and the fat thereon are offered upon the altar, therefore they may not be eaten]. Rather, the verse states, <italic>For whosoever eateth the fat &#x2018;of the beast&#x2019; of which men present an offering</italic> &#x2026; , thus teaching that the <italic>cheilev</italic> of any animal which <italic>can be</italic> brought as an offering &#x2014; whether it is actually brought as a hallowed offering or is eaten as common food &#x2014; is forbidden to be eaten. Thus the verse establishes that <italic>cheilev</italic> of the ox, sheep, and goat [from which offerings can be brought] is forbidden to be eaten, whether it be an offering or common food. See further, Note 277.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn267">(267) Verses: 4 and 10, etc. And yet even the Karaites do not forbid these foods&#x0021;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn277">(277) So also in Ibn Ezra here. The &#x201C;Sadducees,&#x201D; strictly speaking, were a sect during the Second Temple that denied the authority of the oral tradition. The name Sadducee, however, became a synonym for all those who denied Talmudic authority. The reference here is definitely to the Karaites &#x2014; a sect which appeared in the Gaonic period (760 Common Era) which rejected the authority of the Oral Law, and based itself on individual interpretation of the Torah. A major contention of theirs (based upon the present verse) was that the tail is forbidden to be eaten since it is here called <italic>cheilev</italic>. See also Maimonides who writes: &#x201C;the heretics who here in the Orient are called Karaites&#x201D; (&#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, p. 160).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn278">(278) Proverbs 26:5. Ramban&#x2019;s allusion [in his words &#x201C;for in matters of Torah it has been said, <italic>Answer</italic> &#x2026; &#x201D;] is to a point the Sages have made regarding an obvious contradiction in the Book of Proverbs. In Verse 4 there it states, <italic>Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him</italic>, and immediately in the following verse it states, <italic>Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes</italic>. The Sages explained that there is no contradiction: &#x201C;in matters of Torah answer him, but in other matters do not&#x201D; (Shabbath 30b). It is to this principle that Ramban alludes in writing, &#x201C;for in matters of Torah it has been said &#x2026; &#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn279">(279) Aboth 2:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn280">(280) &#x201C;In order to.&#x201D; In our standards text of the Mishnah: &#x201C;and know what to.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn281">(281) See in Exodus, Vol. II, p. 99, Note 230.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn282">(282) I.e., the Karaites. &#x201C;Saadia persisted in fighting Karaism with literary weapons; and throughout his checkered life he continued to combat its apostles with unrelenting vigor, so that he became the most dreaded and most hated opponent of the [Karaite] sect down to our own times&#x201D; (H. Malter, &#x201C;Saadia Gaon,&#x201D; p. 262).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn283">(283) In other words, since <italic>chelbo</italic> comes with the pronominal suffix [meaning &#x201C;its fat&#x201D;], the word <italic>ha&#x2019;alyah</italic> (the tail) should likewise have come in that form: <italic>elyato</italic> (&#x201C;its tail&#x201D;).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn284">(284) Or since <italic>v&#x2019;ha&#x2019;alyah</italic> (according to Saadia Gaon&#x2019;s interpretation) comes without the pronominal suffix, the word <italic>chelbo</italic> should also not have it, making it &#x2014; <italic>hacheilev v&#x2019;ha&#x2019;alyah</italic>. Thus Ibn Ezra is saying that the Karaite interpretation still stands, for since it is written <italic>chelbo ha&#x2019;alyah</italic> it would appear that <italic>ha&#x2019;alyah</italic> is in apposition to <italic>chelbo</italic>, thus explaining: &#x201C;What is <italic>chelbo? Ha&#x2019;alyah</italic>.&#x201D; &#x2014; Ramban, however, will refute this argument of Ibn Ezra, bringing proof from another verse in Scripture which mentions two nouns together, and yet one is written with a pronominal suffix and the other without. Thus Saadia Gaon&#x2019;s refutation of the Karaite interpretation is valid, and the tradition that the tail is not <italic>cheilev</italic> is confirmed. See, however, further in text where Ramban comments on the Gaon&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn285">(285) Joshua 8:33. Here <italic>u&#x2019;zkeinav</italic> (and their elders) comes with a pronominal suffix, and <italic>v&#x2019;shotrim</italic> (and officers) does not. In our case too it is therefore correct to say, as Saadia Gaon does, that <italic>chelbo ha&#x2019;alyah</italic> means <italic>chelbo v&#x2019;ha&#x2019;alyah</italic>, and the two nouns do not stand in apposition to each other, thus proving that the <italic>alyah</italic> is not <italic>cheilev</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn286">(286) Further, 7:25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn287">(287) Ramban&#x2019;s intent is to Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s statement there that <italic>cheilev</italic> of a cattle slaughtered as common food is not forbidden to be eaten (see above Note 266). That opinion is more harmful than what the Karaite have said. For in abstaining from eating the fat of the tail no infringement of the Torah is incurred, whilst in eating of the <italic>cheilev</italic> of cattle slaughtered as common food, one violates a prohibition of the Torah&#x0021;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn288">(288) In other words, Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s argument against the Gaon&#x2019;s interpretation is surely not valid, as explained above. Yet the Gaon&#x2019;s interpretation is also not persuasive, since his explanation is dependent upon a missing connective <italic>vav</italic>, making the word <italic>ha&#x2019;alyah &#x2014; v&#x2019;ha&#x2019;alyah</italic> (&#x201C;and&#x201D; the tail). Such an interpretation is not sufficiently convincing to base thereon the permission to eat the tail.</ftnote>

Then follows the verse: <italic>And if his means suffice not for a &#x2018;seh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>lamb</italic>). The word <italic>seh</italic> in this case must perforce mean a ewe-lamb or she-goat. Thus it is proven that Scripture uses the term <italic>seh</italic> also for the female.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn298">(298) Up to this chapter the subjects dealt with have been the burnt-offering, the meal-offering, and the peace-offerings &#x2014; all of which are voluntary and are not brought for the commission of sin.

This was unlike the procedure done to the sin-offering of the prince and the common man, of which only the fats were burnt on the altar, whereas the meat was eaten by the priests (further, 6:17-23). Hence the name given to the first two categories of sin-offerings [&#x201C;bulls to be entirely burnt&#x201D;].</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn309">(309) Verse 31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn310">(310) The <italic>asham talui</italic> (suspensive guilt-offering) is brought in case of doubt about one of those major sins for which the penalty if committed wilfully is excision, and a sin-offering if committed unintentionally. This offering is called a suspensive guilt-offering. An example of a case of a doubt which calls for such an offering is the following. Suppose a person has before him two pieces of fat, one of which is Scripturally-forbidden food, and the other is permitted to be eaten, and he eats one of the two [whilst the other is eaten by another person or lost]. A doubt then arises in his mind as to whether the piece he has eaten was the permitted or the forbidden food. In such a case he must bring an offering so as to effect atonement, and this is called a suspensive guilt-offering. If it is later established that he ate the forbidden fat, he must then bring a sin-offering (See Maimonides, &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, pp. 79-80). The point Ramban makes thus is that the verse before us teaches that the sin-offering of the assembly can be brought only when it is definitely confirmed that it has sinned [unintentionally], unlike the suspensive guilt-offering of the individual which is brought in case of doubt.</ftnote>

The particular &#x201C;sin,&#x201D; however, is not known, since the court does not know which of the forbidden foods it was that they incorrectly ruled to be permitted. In such a case, this verse teaches us that they do not bring a sin-offering. Horayoth 7b.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn331">(331) Psalms 19:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn332">(332) The section here discusses the offering of higher or lower value (see above, Note 15), the verse before us stating that this offering is required in the case of a false oath concerning testimony. Thus, if the person interested in the evidence called upon him by an oath, adjuring him that if he knows any evidence favorable to him he should testify before the court, and he swore that he knows of no testimony concerning him, when in fact he does know, in such a case, if he swore either unintentionally or wilfully, he must offer what is called an offering of higher or lower value. See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, pp. 82-83. In the following verse another transgression for which this offering is required is mentioned. &#x2014; Ramban now proceeds to explain the sense of the triple expression, <italic>and he is a witness, or knows, or saw</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn333">(333) Shebuoth 33b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn334">(334) A Hebrew unit of weight and value, equal to the sixtieth part of a talent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn335">(335) And Shimon claims: &#x201C;Let such and such persons come and testify that they saw you [Reuben] delivering me the money, and I will pay you&#x201D; (Rashi, <italic>ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn336">(336) But since Shimon denied that this transaction had ever taken place, and says that if Reuben can produce the witnesses he claims he has to testify that they saw Reuben delivering him money, he will pay Reuben &#x2014; then the witnesses&#x2019; testimony that they <italic>saw</italic> Reuben giving Shimon money is sufficiently valid to obligate Shimon to pay Reuben, although they did not <italic>know</italic> the nature of that transaction. If therefore they withhold their testimony, they are liable to bring the offering dealt with here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn337">(337) This is the second type of case for which the offering of higher or lower value is required. It is known as &#x201C;the defilement of the Sanctuary or its hallowed things.&#x201D; Thus if a person who has been made unclean by any of the primary sources of uncleanness, unintentionally enters the Sanctuary, or unintentionally eats meat that is holy, he must bring the above-mentioned offering. A third &#x2014; and final &#x2014; case is if one swears an oath of utterance [&#x201C;I shall eat&#x201D; or &#x201C;I shall not eat&#x201D; and the like], and unintentionally fails to keep it. In this case too he is required to bring this offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn338">(338) Above, Chapter 4, Verses 13, 22, and 27.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn339">(339) For the offering had to be brought first, then the laying of hands was performed during which [while his hands lay on the offering] he confessed his sin (see Note 64 above). Hence the expression <italic>and he shall bring his guilt-offering</italic> must mean &#x201C;and he who comes to bring an offering to effect atonement for his guilt &#x2026; &#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn340">(340) Further, 16:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn341">(341) Above, Chapter 4, Verses 4, 15, 24 and 29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn342">(342) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Chapter 1, Verse 4; Chapter 3, Verses 2, 8 and 13. See also Note 11 above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn343">(343) If Reuben says to Shimon, &#x201C;Give me my deposit which you have,&#x201D; and Shimon replies &#x201C;I swear I have naught of yours,&#x201D; or if Shimon said, &#x201C;I have naught of yours,&#x201D; and Reuben says, &#x201C;I adjure thee&#x201D; and he answers &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; &#x2014; in this case too Shimon is liable to bring an offering [in addition to the restitution] even if he wilfully swore falsely. The offering, however, is not the one of higher or lower value mentioned in this section &#x2014; but a guilt-offering, as explained further on (in Verses 23-26). Ramban mentions the &#x201C;oath of deposit&#x201D; here only to liken it to the &#x201C;oath of testimony&#x201D; in the sense that the offerings in each case are brought even if committed wilfully. This is a novel point in the law of offerings, for all other offerings brought for commission of a sin effect atonement only in case the transgression has been committed in error; otherwise, <italic>the offering of the wicked is an abomination</italic> (Proverbs 21:27). Ramban thus suggests [in line with the plain meaning of Scripture] that since the offerings in these two cases &#x2014; that of the &#x201C;oath of testimony&#x201D; and the &#x201C;oath of deposit&#x201D; &#x2014; are required to be brought even when committed wilfully, therefore the Torah mentions in their cases the subject of confession. But in the case of all other sin-offerings, since they are brought only when the transgression was committed in error, there is no need for confession of sin. However, Ramban will immediately refute this position, for the Rabbis have clearly interpreted that all sin-offerings require confession of sin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn344">(344) Numbers 5:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn345">(345) &#x201C;But [when bringing] the sin-offering for a sin committed in error he does not confess&#x201D; (Tur in quoting the language of Ramban).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn346">(346) Sifre <italic>Zuta</italic> 5:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn347">(347) As distinct from the offering of higher or lower value, where the offering varies according to the means of the transgressor, a fixed sin-offering must be of an animal and is alike for poor and rich, so that if the poor cannot afford it he is not obligated to bring another offering in its stead, as is the case of the offering of higher or lower value. See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, pp. 78-79.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn348">(348) Sifre <italic>Naso</italic> 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn349">(349) Numbers 5:6-7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn350">(350) I.e., in view of the fact that nothing of the bird sin-offering is burnt on the altar, while the fats of the animal sin-offering are burnt thereon, Scripture therefore required that the poor man who cannot afford the animal offering, should bring two birds, one for a sin-offering [which is the required offering in this case], and an additional bird as a burnt-offering, to take the place of the fats of the animal sin-offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn351">(351) Above, Verse 6. In this case the word &#x2018;<italic>ashamo</italic>&#x2019; [literally, &#x201C;guilt&#x201D;] is not the name of the offering, but merely indicates &#x201C;the offering &#x2014; i.e., a sin-offering &#x2014; brought because of guilt.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn352">(352) A male goat is brought as a sin-offering by the prince (above, 4:23), and by the public for worshipping idols (Numbers 15:24), as well as on the Day of Atonement (further, 16:5). Among the Additional Offerings brought by the public on the New Moon (Numbers 28:15) and the Festivals (<italic>ibid.</italic>, Verse 22, etc.) is also a he-goat as a sin-offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn353">(353) Bullocks are brought as sin-offerings by the anointed priest (above, 4:3), by the court (<italic>ibid.</italic>, Verse 14), and by the High Priest on the Day of Atonement (further, 16:3).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn354">(354) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Chapter 14, Verses 12 and 19. How could one person have a simultaneous liability to bring these two offerings?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn355">(355) Psalms 5:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn356">(356) I have found no such verse. Possibly it is a paraphrase of the verses in Jeremiah 9:9-10, where the prophet bewails the emptiness of the destroyed <italic>pastures of the wilderness</italic>, and predicts that the cities of Judah will be <italic>sh&#x2019;mama</italic> (wasted away). Thus both phrases occur in juxtaposition, and Ramban deduces therefrom the underlying idea of the root <italic>shamam</italic>. Perhaps it is a combination of Isaiah 24:6 [where the word <italic>vaye&#x2019;shmu</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;and they wasted away&#x201D;] and Joel 1:19 [where <italic>the pastures of the wilderness</italic>] are mentioned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn357">(357) Hosea 14:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn358">(358) Genesis 42:21. Thus in place of the usual translation &#x201C;we are guilty&#x201D; [concerning our brother] Ramban interprets it to mean &#x201C;we are being punished&#x201D; on account of our brother.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn359">(359) Judges 20:16.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn365">(365) The leper&#x2019;s first offering [on the day he is cleansed] is the guilt-offering (further, 14:12). After that he brings a sin-offering (<italic>ibid.</italic>, Verse 19). In the light of the above explanation of the term <italic>asham</italic>, Ramban suggests a reason why the leper brings the two offerings at the same time when both atone for sin, and why the guilt-offering first. There is indeed a third offering &#x2014; namely, the burnt-offering &#x2014; that the leper brought on that day (<italic>ibid.</italic>, Verse 20). But since that presents no difficulty, Ramban does not refer to it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn366">(366) Nedarim 64b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn367">(367) See Note 310 above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn368">(368) Verse 15. &#x2014; I.e., two <italic>s&#x2019;laim</italic>. See also Rashi on Verse 18 [speaking of the suspensive guilt-offering]: &#x201C;<italic>a ram &#x2026; with thy valuation</italic> &#x2014; according to the value stated above&#x201D; [in Verse 15, i.e., at least two shekels].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn369">(369) Verse 19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn370">(370) Above, Verse 6. The question arose (see Ramban at beginning of this verse), why the Torah calls it <italic>ashamo</italic> (his guilt-offering) when it is really a sin-offering &#x2014; Ramban now proposes to answer that &#x201C;it is because etc.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn371">(371) In other words, the determining factor for the difference in the names between the <italic>chatath</italic> and the <italic>asham</italic> is whether the offering is male or female. For the fuller mystical implication, see my Hebrew commentary, p. 26.</ftnote>

<title>Tzav</title>
<h1>6</h1>
<p>2. &#x2018;TZAV&#x2019; (COMMAND) AARON. In the [preceding] section of <italic>Vayikra</italic>, Scripture stated, <italic>Speak unto the children of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn372">1</xref></sup> for there He gave the command about the bringing of the offerings, and it is upon the Israelites to bring them. But here He states, <italic>Command Aaron and his sons</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn373">2</xref></sup> for He now speaks of the rites of the offerings and these are performed by the priests.</p>
<p>Now Rashi wrote: &#x201C;<italic>Command Aaron</italic>. The expression &#x2018;command &#x2026;&#x2019; always implies urging [to fulfill the command] at once, and also for future generations. Rabbi Shimon said: Scripture found it especially necessary to urge, in cases where fulfillment of a command involves monetary loss.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn374">3</xref></sup> But the explanation of Rabbi Shimon was not [said] with reference to this command, for here there is no monetary loss involved to the priests to whom this command was given. Indeed, they gain profit and reward from all the offerings,<sup><xref rid="fn375">4</xref></sup> even the burnt-offering.<sup><xref rid="fn376">5</xref></sup> Rather, the intention of the First Sage [whom Rashi quoted] in saying, &#x201C;the expression &#x2018;command &#x2026;&#x2019; always implies urging [to fulfill the command] at once and also for future generations,&#x201D; was to say that in those sections of the Torah where Scripture wanted to urge fulfillment, saying that they should be fulfilled immediately and that they apply throughout the generations, it uses this expression of &#x201C;command &#x2026; &#x201D; But in other sections it will say, &#x201C;speak&#x201D; to the children of Israel, or &#x201C;say&#x201D; unto them. With this [generalization] Rabbi Shimon differed, saying that sometimes<sup><xref rid="fn377">6</xref></sup> this expression [&#x201C;command &#x2026; &#x201D;] occurs in a matter which is not to be fulfilled immediately and throughout the generations, but it is used because the command involves a monetary loss. Such [a use of the word] &#x201C;command&#x201D; is that found in the case of the oil of the lighting<sup><xref rid="fn378">7</xref></sup> [where, according to Rabbi Shimon, the expression &#x201C;command &#x2026; &#x201D; is used because it applies immediately and for all generations, as well as for the reason that it involves a monetary loss], and that which Scripture states, <italic>Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn379">8</xref></sup> [which is a case where the use of the expression &#x201C;command&#x201D; can only be because monetary loss is involved, since it did not apply at once, but only after they had taken possession of the Land].</p>
<p>It is possible that we say that our command does involve a monetary loss to the priests, as a result of that which it says further on [in this section], <italic>This is the offering of Aaron and his sons</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn380">9</xref></sup> which is a continuation of this command. However, at the beginning of the Sifre,<sup><xref rid="fn381">10</xref></sup> the opinions [of the First Sage and that of Rabbi Shimon] are taught in a manner indicating that they hold opposing views.<sup><xref rid="fn382">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>THIS IS &#x2018;TORATH&#x2019; (THE LAW OF) THE BURNT-OFFERING. &#x201C;This text is intended to teach us that the burning of the fats and limbs of offerings is valid [if performed anytime] during the whole night [following the day on which they were slaughtered]. It is also intended to teach us which of the disqualified offerings, although already brought up on to the altar, must be taken down, and which of them if already brought up need not be taken down. For all expressions of <italic>torath</italic><sup><xref rid="fn383">12</xref></sup> [introducing a group of laws] denote inclusion &#x2014; one law for all offerings that are brought up on to the altar, including some disqualified ones, namely that if they are already brought up on to the altar, they need not be taken down.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>But this law does not [in fact] apply to <italic>everything</italic> that has already been brought up on to the altar, but only to all offerings proper, for if drink-offerings<sup><xref rid="fn384">13</xref></sup> are brought on to the altar [when they are not supposed to be] they must be taken down; and even if the libations are correctly offered up and the offering is disqualified, or the offering is correctly offered up and the libations disqualified, and definitely where both are disqualified &#x2014; in all these cases, the offering itself is not to be taken down again, and the libations are to be taken down&#x0021; For such is the sense of the inclusive term <italic>torath ha&#x2019;olah</italic> (<italic>the law of the burnt-offering</italic>), teaching, &#x201C;one law for all that goeth up [as the due of the altar-fires]&#x201D; but not for the drink-offerings [since they are not poured on the fires, but into a silver bowl placed at the south-west corner of the altar],<sup><xref rid="fn385">14</xref></sup> nor for the blood [which was sprinkled on the sides of the altar], in accordance with the words of Rabbi Yehoshua.<sup><xref rid="fn386">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now this verse [also] teaches that we should not <italic>offer</italic> the burnt-offering at night, but if it was slaughtered and its blood sprinkled [on the altar] during the daytime, we may burn its limbs all night, the same law applying to the fats of the peace-offering. And the explanation of the expression &#x2018;<italic>hi ha&#x2019;olah</italic>&#x2019; is as if it said: &#x2018;<italic>tiheyeh&#x2019; ha&#x2019;olah</italic> (the burnt-offering &#x201C;shall be&#x201D;) <italic>on the firewood upon the altar all night</italic>. He uses the word <italic>hi</italic> [literally: &#x201C;she&#x201D;] in order to exclude<sup><xref rid="fn387">16</xref></sup> those things which the Rabbis have specified in the interpretation thereof. Now according to the [Rabbinical] interpretation this verse does not teach us that we are to bring up the limbs [of the offerings] from the ground to the altar at night, for this [principle] they have already derived from another verse, <italic>Neither shall the fat of My feast remain all night until the morning</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn388">17</xref></sup> [which the Sages interpreted<sup><xref rid="fn389">18</xref></sup> to mean, &#x201C;<italic>Neither shall the fat of My feast remain</italic> on the stone pavement of the Court below, <italic>all night until the morning</italic>, but you should bring it up to the altar&#x201D;]. For it is from that verse that the Rabbis have derived the law that [fats and limbs of the offerings] become disqualified [for the altar] if they remained upon the pavement [until the morning], but they may be brought up to the altar at any time during the night. Here Scripture speaks of those limbs which had already been brought up during daytime, [to teach] that the priest turns them over on the altar during the whole night until the morning. It is for this reason that He says <italic>hi ha&#x2019;olah</italic> [using the definite article], meaning: &#x201C;the one which has already come up&#x201D; on the altar. It also teaches us that even those that are invalid, are not to be brought down again, [once they were taken up onto the altar], provided they became invalid in the Court of the Sanctuary [such as where they had remained overnight or had been unclean, etc.; but if they became invalid before reaching the Sanctuary Court, such as an animal that had been set apart for idolatry, or had been worshipped etc., these must be brought down].<sup><xref rid="fn390">19</xref></sup> It also teaches that [invalid] drink-offerings<sup><xref rid="fn384">13</xref></sup> must come down [since they do not go upon the fires on the altar],<sup><xref rid="fn385">14</xref></sup> and so also the blood [which had become invalidated], as I have written.</p>
<p>AND THE FIRE OF THE ALTAR SHALL BE BLAZING IN IT. Scripture is stating that it should burn on the altar during the whole night, it being a positive commandment that the priests should put on at daytime a lot of wood in order that it should not be burnt up completely and the fire [should not] become extinguished from it [during the night]. In my opinion, that which He said, <italic>Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn391">20</xref></sup> is a commandment directed to the priests to keep fire burning continually upon the altar, just as He said, <italic>and the priest shall kindle wood upon it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn392">21</xref></sup> commanding them that they should be careful about this &#x2014; to set fire in order and put enough wood on it to keep the fire burning continually, all day and all night. He gave an additional caution by means of a negative commandment, [<italic>it shall not go out</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn391">20</xref></sup> meaning that it should never be allowed to become extinguished. Thus if the priests were careless and the fire became extinguished they would transgress this negative commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn393">22</xref></sup> It is for this reason that our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn394">23</xref></sup> that [in addition to the large wood-stack burning on the altar] there was a second wood-stack solely for the purpose of keeping up the fire. And that which Scripture states, <italic>And the fire upon the altar shall be blazing in it; it shall not go out</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn392">21</xref></sup> is a redundant verse, and is therefore interpreted by our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn395">24</xref></sup> as having reference to all people, teaching that whoever extinguishes the fire, transgresses a negative commandment. Even if he extinguishes only one of the live coals of the wood-stack, he is liable to whipping, whether he put it out on top of the altar, or whether he extinguished it below [on the pavement of the Court] after he had taken it down. It appears to me that he violates only one negative commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn396">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND THE PRIEST SHALL PUT ON &#x2018;MIDO&#x2019; (HIS GARMENT OF) LINEN. &#x201C;This is a reference to the <italic>k&#x2019;toneth</italic> (tunic). Why then does Scripture here call it <italic>mido</italic> [which means &#x2018;his measure&#x2019;]? It is to indicate that the tunic is to be made to his measure. AND HIS LINEN BREECHES SHALL HE PUT UPON HIS FLESH &#x2014; that there should be nothing interposing between them.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>Now the [daily] removal of the ashes [from the altar, which is the subject-matter of this verse], must be done with the priest wearing the [four] garments of priesthood,<sup><xref rid="fn397">26</xref></sup> as no Service can be performed with only two of the [four] garments&#x0021; However, He mentioned only these two garments because of new points that are added here to them, namely, that the tunic must be made to the priest&#x2019;s measure. This means to say that if it was raised [above his feet], being so short that it did not reach his feet, and he performed therein one of the acts of offering, his Service is invalid. It further teaches that there must be nothing intervening between the breeches and his flesh. But the law requires equally that the priest who removes the ashes from the altar should wear all [four] priestly garments, for since Scripture mentioned that the removing of the ashes must be done with priestly garments, we know [automatically] that it requires four for the common priest and eight for the High Priest.<sup><xref rid="fn397">26</xref></sup> So also is it explained in the second chapter of Tractate Yoma<sup><xref rid="fn398">27</xref></sup> and in Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn399">28</xref></sup> &#x201C;Why does Scripture repeat the term <italic>yilbash</italic> [&#x2018;he shall put on&#x2019; &#x2014; &#x2018;<italic>V&#x2019;lavash hakohein</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>and the priest shall put on</italic>) <italic>his linen garment, and his linen breeches &#x2018;yilbash&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he shall put</italic>) <italic>upon his flesh</italic>]? It is to include the turban and the belt&#x201D; [which the priest is also to put on for the removing of the ashes].</p>
<p>Now Onkelos translated the word <italic>mido</italic> as <italic>levushin</italic> [&#x201C;garments&#x201D; &#x2014; as opposed to Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation, according to which it refers only to one garment, the tunic]. It would appear then that according to Onkelos, the word <italic>mido</italic> is a term which includes all of the priest&#x2019;s garments, as if the verse were stating, &#x201C;and the priest shall put on linen garments.&#x201D; Similarly we are to understand the expressions: &#x2018;<italic>madav</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>his clothes</italic>) <italic>rent;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn400">29</xref></sup> <italic>that cometh down upon the collar &#x2018;midothav&#x2019;</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn401">30</xref></sup> which means upon the edge of his garments; <italic>girded with &#x2018;mido&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>his apparel</italic>) <italic>of war</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn402">31</xref></sup> which means his garments. This then will be in accordance with the opinion of the Sage who says<sup><xref rid="fn403">32</xref></sup> that the belt of the common priest was unlike the belt of the High Priest.<sup><xref rid="fn404">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND HE SHALL PUT OFF HIS GARMENTS, [AND PUT ON OTHER GARMENTS, AND CARRY FORTH THE ASHES WITHOUT THE CAMP UNTO A CLEAN PLACE].<sup><xref rid="fn405">34</xref></sup> &#x201C;This was not compulsory for him to do so, but it would be a matter of propriety, so that he should not soil the garments in which he regularly ministers at the altar, by the removal of the ashes to a place without the camp. Garments worn when boiling the pot for one&#x2019;s master, one should not wear when pouring out a glass of wine for him. That is why He said, <italic>and he shall put on other garments</italic> &#x2014; of [a quality] inferior [to those in which he ministers at the altar].&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Now the intent of our Rabbis in this remark was to state that the taking of the ashes [to a place outside the camp] must be done with the priests wearing the priestly garments, and thus the <italic>other garments</italic> [mentioned in the verse] are not ordinary clothes. Thus I do not know the source for that which the Rabbi [Rashi] said, that &#x201C;it was not compulsory&#x201D; [that he remove the garments in which he performs the regular Divine Service, and put on other garments when taking out the ashes to a place outside the camp]. For it would appear that it is a positive commandment to the priest, that the garments in which he performs the acts of offering, including the [daily] lifting up of the ashes, be clean ones, and that he must not perform the regular Divine Service with those garments in which he takes the ashes [outside the camp]. This commandment [of the changing of the garments] is of the nature of a servant&#x2019;s etiquette towards his master. Therefore the priests should have more expensive garments for performing the acts of offering, and ones of inferior quality for removing the ashes [to a place outside the camp or city of Jerusalem].</p>
<p>All this is in accordance with this reasoning which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote [i.e., that the removal of the ashes must be done in priestly garments]. But there are some of our Rabbis mentioned there in Tractate Yoma<sup><xref rid="fn406">35</xref></sup> who say that the taking out of the ashes did not have to be done in priestly garments. Thus the verse stating, <italic>and he shall put on other garments</italic> means &#x201C;ordinary clothes,&#x201D; and this is also the plain meaning of the verse, commanding the priest that he should not soil <italic>the linen garments, which are the holy garments</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn407">36</xref></sup> with the taking out of the ashes; instead he is to put on ordinary clothes.</p>
<p>7. AND THIS IS THE LAW OF THE MEAL-OFFERING. This section, according to the plain meaning of Scripture, adds [to Chapter 2 above where the law of the meal-offering was discussed] four commandments about the meal-offering: that [the residue be] eaten unleavened, that it be eaten <italic>in the Court of the Tent of Meeting</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn408">37</xref></sup> that <italic>every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn409">38</xref></sup> and that whatever touches it becomes holy.<sup><xref rid="fn410">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now according to the Rabbinical interpretation thereof, there are many new teachings added [in this section, among them being the following]: that even of a meal-offering brought by priests the handful is taken out [and burnt on the altar, in the same way as the residue which must be burnt on the altar];<sup><xref rid="fn411">40</xref></sup> that the priest must bring it near <italic>before the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn412">41</xref></sup> which means to the western corner [of the altar, since the Tent of Meeting where the ark of the covenant stood, was to the west of the altar, and therefore nearest to it], and <italic>in front of the altar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn412">41</xref></sup> which means to the southern corner [since the ramp of the altar which is its &#x201C;front,&#x201D; was on the south side thereof]. Thus you find that it had to be &#x201C;presented&#x201D; [i.e., brought near] to the southwestern corner of the altar. [And this section further teaches:] <italic>And he shall take up from it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn413">42</xref></sup> a handful &#x2014; &#x201C;from it&#x201D; as one joined mass, meaning that he is not to bring one tenth of an ephah of flour [which is the amount brought for a meal-offering] in two receptacles [but it must be a full tenth of an ephah in one receptacle], nor is he to make a fixed measure that holds as much as his handful [to remove the amount of flour for the altar, but he must do it with his hand]. He also states, <italic>It shall not be baked as anything leavened</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn414">43</xref></sup> This is to liken all the stages of work [in the preparation of the meal-offering] to baking, thus teaching that one is also liable for kneading and rolling it if it be leavened, and that for each and every such act he transgresses a negative commandment and is liable to whipping on each count.</p>
<p>10. I HAVE GIVEN IT AS THEIR PORTION OF MY OFFERINGS. Even to apportion it [i.e., the residue of the meal-offering which the priests are to eat] they are not permitted to do until after the parts given to the fire [i.e., the handful] have gone up on the altar. It is from here that we learn that the same law applies to all hallowed offerings, as it is written, <italic>I have given it as their portion of My offerings; it is most holy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn415">44</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>It shall not be baked as anything leavened. Their portion</italic> &#x2026;<sup><xref rid="fn416">45</xref></sup> &#x2014; even the residue [which the priests receive as their share of the meal-offering] may not be baked with leaven. <italic>As the sin-offering, and as the guilt-offering</italic> &#x2014; this teaches that just as the sin-offering must come from ordinary money,<sup><xref rid="fn417">46</xref></sup> and can be offered only at daytime, and the priest performs all its acts with his right arm &#x2014; so also this meal-offering must come from ordinary money, and be brought at daytime, and its acts must be performed with the priest&#x2019;s right hand. <italic>Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn409">38</xref></sup> &#x2014; it may be apportioned even amongst those priests who have a bodily blemish [such as are mentioned further in Chapter 21:16-21 as disqualifying them from performing the acts of offering, but they may eat the residue of the meal-offering].</p>
<p>Now with regards to the meal-offering of the priests He added [this command]: <italic>And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt; it shall not be eaten</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn418">47</xref></sup> On this the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup><xref rid="fn419">48</xref></sup> that the reason [for the meal-offering of the priest being entirely burnt] is because every priest offered up his own meal-offering himself, and if he were to offer it and eat the residue of it himself, it would appear as if he had brought no offering. For nothing was offered of an ordinary individual&#x2019;s meal-offering<sup><xref rid="fn420">49</xref></sup> except the frankincense and the handful of the flour. If then, in addition to the fact that the whole offering was small, he who offered it were to eat it himself, he would imagine<sup><xref rid="fn421">50</xref></sup> that he had brought no offering at all. Therefore [the Torah required] that it be entirely burnt.</p>
<p>18. THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SIN-OFFERING. In <italic>Seder Vayikra</italic> He commanded concerning [the offerings in the following order]: the burnt-offering, the meal-offering, the peace-offerings, the sin-offering and the guilt-offering, [the reason for this order being] that at first He spoke about the freewill offerings [namely the burnt-offering, the meal-offering and the peace-offerings], and afterwards He mentioned those offerings which are obligatory upon the sinner. Here, however, [in <italic>Seder Tzav</italic>] the explanation is given first in connection with the burnt-offering and meal-offering, and only then about the sin-offering and guilt-offering, because He wished to explain the laws of the most holy offerings [in one group], since there is one law for them all, as He said [above in Verse 10] with reference to the meal-offering, <italic>it is most holy, as the sin-offering and the guilt-offering</italic>, and only afterwards He explains the law of those offerings which are less holy [namely, the peace-offerings].</p>
<p>Now in this section [dealing with the sin-offering] He added many new laws. [The verse] <italic>This is the law of the sin-offering</italic> teaches that there is one law for all sin-offerings,<sup><xref rid="fn422">51</xref></sup> meaning that even the blood of &#x201C;the inner sin-offerings&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn423">52</xref></sup> [if sprinkled upon a garment] must be washed off [<italic>in a holy place</italic>]. I might think that this applies also to a sin-offering brought from a bird, Scripture therefore says <italic>zoth</italic> [<italic>&#x2018;zoth&#x2019; torath hachatath</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;this&#x2019; is the law of the sin-offering</italic>) &#x2014; and the word <italic>zoth</italic> denotes exclusion]. He also states here [in the verse before us], <italic>in the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered shall the sin-offering be slaughtered before the Eternal</italic>, thus indicating that all sin-offerings must be slaughtered only on the northern side of the altar, since in the section of <italic>Vayikra</italic> this was stated only with reference to the sin-offering of the prince<sup><xref rid="fn424">53</xref></sup> and of the individual;<sup><xref rid="fn425">54</xref></sup> therefore here [in this section] they are all included &#x2014; the sin-offerings of the public and &#x201C;the inner sin-offerings.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn423">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Rabbis have further interpreted: <italic>Most holy</italic>, this comes to include the peace-offerings of the public,<sup><xref rid="fn426">55</xref></sup> teaching that they may only be slaughtered on the northern side of the altar, as all offerings of the most holy degree are required to be slaughtered on the northern side. <italic>Hi</italic> (this) &#x2014; <italic>&#x2018;this&#x2019; is the law of the sin-offering</italic>, comes to exclude the thanks-offering<sup><xref rid="fn427">56</xref></sup> and the ram of the Nazirite<sup><xref rid="fn428">57</xref></sup> [thus teaching that they may be slaughtered anywhere in the Temple Court, as their holiness is of a lesser degree]. He further commanded here to give the meat of the sin-offerings to the sons of Aaron<sup><xref rid="fn429">58</xref></sup> &#x2014; that is, to the males and not the daughters of Aaron &#x2014; and commanded them to eat it <italic>within the Court of the Tent of Meeting</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn430">59</xref></sup> In addition He mentioned [in this section] many new laws concerning absorption [of the taste of] the sin-offerings [by the vessels in which they are boiled].<sup><xref rid="fn431">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. THOU SHALT WASH IT IN A HOLY PLACE. Scripture laid down a strict law in connection with the blood [of a sin-offering] which became absorbed by a garment, giving it the law it [the blood] had before it was sprinkled [on the garment, namely] that it may not be taken outside the curtains<sup><xref rid="fn432">61</xref></sup> [and therefore it must be washed within the Court]. He states, <italic>and the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn431">60</xref></sup> This too is to be broken in the holy place [i.e., within the Court], and the pieces of pottery are swallowed up in the place [where they are broken],<sup><xref rid="fn433">62</xref></sup> and there does not have to be any scouring and rinsing at all [as required if it was boiled in a copper pot]. Similarly, the scouring and rinsing required if [the meat of the sin-offering] was boiled in a copper pot<sup><xref rid="fn431">60</xref></sup> have to be done in a holy place, for all the verses [i.e., Verses 20-21] are connected with &#x201C;the holy place&#x201D; mentioned [above in Verse 19: <italic>in &#x2018;a holy place&#x2019; shall it be eaten, in the Court of the Tent of Meeting</italic>].</p>
<p>23. AND EVERY SIN-OFFERING, WHEREOF ANY OF THE BLOOD IS BROUGHT INTO THE TENT OF MEETING etc. &#x201C;This means that if the priest brought any of the blood of &#x2018;an outer sin-offering&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn423">52</xref></sup> into the interior of the Sanctuary it becomes invalidated, [and the offering may not be eaten, and must be burnt].&#x201D; Thus the language of Rashi. According to this opinion, the phrase <italic>to atone in the holy place</italic> which Scripture says [in continuation], is not to be understood in its simple sense, since this blood does not [in fact] bring atonement, for it became invalidated as soon as it was brought into the Sanctuary, and it is on account of that very invalidation that it is to be burnt. Rather, the expression <italic>to atone</italic> means [according to Rashi] that if he brought it into the interior &#x201C;with the intent to atone,&#x201D; [namely] to sprinkle there of its blood as is done with the blood of &#x201C;the inner sin-offerings,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn423">52</xref></sup> even though he has not [in fact] atoned with it, meaning that he has not sprinkled any of its blood, it is nonetheless invalidated from the moment of entry, and [the offering] is to be burnt. It is possible according to this that if he brought it in with the intent of not sprinkling thereof at all [in the Sanctuary], that the offering remains valid. According to the words of Rabbi Shimon,<sup><xref rid="fn434">63</xref></sup> it only becomes invalidated if he &#x201C;atoned&#x201D; with the blood, meaning that he actually sprinkled thereof in the same manner as is done in the case of &#x201C;the inner sin-offerings&#x201D; [i.e., in front of the Veil and on the comers of the golden altar].<sup><xref rid="fn435">64</xref></sup> It is for this reason that Scripture states <italic>to atone</italic> &#x2014; not [meaning] that he actually effected atonement, but that he brought of its blood to atone with it, and, according to his thinking, effected atonement. The meaning of the term &#x201C;into the interior&#x201D; [which Rashi mentioned above] is &#x201C;into the Sanctuary.&#x201D; The same [is also the meaning of the phrase] &#x201C;if he brought into the &#x2018;interior of the interior&#x2019; [i.e., the Holy of Holies]&#x201D; of the bullock of the anointed priest,<sup><xref rid="fn436">65</xref></sup> or that of &#x201C;forgetting a matter of law,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn437">66</xref></sup> or of the goats brought for worshipping the idols,<sup><xref rid="fn438">67</xref></sup> namely that if he brought their blood into a more interior place than that designated for them, [since in these cases of sin-offering the blood is to be brought into the Sanctuary proper to effect atonement], then the offerings become invalidated. Scripture states <italic>&#x2018;of&#x2019; the blood</italic> in order to indicate that even bringing in part of the blood invalidates the offering. Thus if the priest received the blood in two cups, and brought only one of them into the interior, the offering is invalidated.</p>
<p>By way of the plain meaning of Scripture,<sup><xref rid="fn439">68</xref></sup> the verse speaks only with reference to &#x201C;the inner sin-offerings,&#x201D; concerning the burning of which He had already commanded,<sup><xref rid="fn440">69</xref></sup> and here Scripture came to add a negative commandment against eating them,<sup><xref rid="fn441">70</xref></sup> for this section is intended to complete the laws of sin-offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn442">71</xref></sup> This is the interpretation of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean in the Torath Kohanim<sup><xref rid="fn443">72</xref></sup> and in Tractate Zebachim.<sup><xref rid="fn444">73</xref></sup></p>
<h1>7</h1>
<p>8. AND THE PRIEST THAT OFFERETH ANY MAN&#x2019;S BURNT-OFFERING, EVEN THE PRIEST SHALL HAVE TO HIMSELF THE SKIN OF THE BURNT-OFFERING. This law applies to all offerings, and although Scripture mentions only the burnt-offering, it holds good of the sin-offering and guilt-offering mentioned above.<sup><xref rid="fn445">74</xref></sup> Such is not the case, however, in reference to the peace-offerings [the skin of which belongs to the owner]; therefore Scripture mentioned the law of the priests&#x2019; due in the middle of the offerings, before it speaks of the peace-offerings [further on in Verses 11-21].</p>
<p>The interpretation of the Rabbis as found in the Torath Kohanim is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn446">75</xref></sup> &#x201C;[From the verse here] I know only that the skin of the burnt-offering [belongs to the priest]. Whence do I know that the same law applies to the skins of [the other] most holy offerings? Scripture therefore says, <italic>that offereth</italic>. Or perhaps I might think that I am to include [also] the skins of the offerings which are holy to a lesser degree [such as the peace-offering etc.]; Scripture therefore says, <italic>burnt-offering</italic>, thus teaching that just as the burnt-offering is distinguished by being of the most holy degree of offerings, [so also this law holds good of all most holy offerings], thus excluding those which are holy in a minor degree.&#x201D;</p>
<p>By way of the plain meaning of Scripture, it was not necessary to state this law [that the skin of the animal belongs to the priest] in connection with the sin-offering and guilt-offering, since they are part of the gifts given to the priests,<sup><xref rid="fn447">76</xref></sup> and the priests thus are entitled to the meat and also the skin, but in the case of the burnt-offering [where the priests do not receive any of the meat, since it is wholly burnt on the altar], it was necessary for Scripture to say that they do acquire the skin. This is the interpretation of Rabbi [Yehuda Hanasi] who says,<sup><xref rid="fn448">77</xref></sup> &#x201C;Essentially we need this verse only for the skin of the burnt-offering [to teach that it belongs to the priest], since the skin always follows the meat&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn449">78</xref></sup> [and here Scripture tells us that it is not to be burnt with the meat]. So also is it explained in the Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn449">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND EVERY MEAL-OFFERING THAT IS BAKED IN THE OVEN, [AND EVERYTHING MADE IN THE BOILING POT, AND IN THE PAN, SHALL BE THE PRIESTS THAT OFFERETH IT]. The simple explanation of this verse is apparent, namely that He is commanding here that if one vows to bring one of the three kinds of meal-offering &#x2014; the one baked in the oven, or made in the boiling pot, or in the pan &#x2014; that they should all be given exclusively to the priest who offered them. Then He states concerning all the other meal-offerings, &#x2014; such as if a person vowed to bring a meal-offering without specification of which kind, in which case he brings it of fine flour, and the meal-offering of first-fruits,<sup><xref rid="fn450">79</xref></sup> which are both mixed with oil; and the meal-offering of the sinner<sup><xref rid="fn451">80</xref></sup> and of the suspected adulteress<sup><xref rid="fn452">81</xref></sup> which are dry [without oil and without frankincense] &#x2014; that they should be divided <italic>among all the sons of Aaron</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn453">82</xref></sup> that is to say, among all priests of their Father&#x2019;s House.<sup><xref rid="fn454">83</xref></sup> The meaning of the expression, <italic>and every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry</italic> &#x2014; is that a meal-offering which is of fine flour only, whether it be mixed with oil or dry, which is not one of these [three] mentioned above [the one baked in the oven, or made in the boiling pot, or in the pan &#x2014; belongs to all priests who were ministering on that day, and not exclusively to the priests who offered them]. The reason for the difference between them is because [in the case of the three meal-offerings mentioned above] the priest took pains in baking them, and therefore he deserves to be given a greater reward. [All this is in accordance with the plain meaning of Scripture].</p>
<p>Our Rabbis, however, did not want to explain the verses in this way because Scripture said, <italic>and every meal-offering, mingled with oil or dry</italic>, which includes <italic>all</italic> possible meal-offerings, since they are all either mingled with oil or dry. Therefore the Rabbis understood the expression <italic>it shall be the priest&#x2019;s that offereth it</italic> [mentioned here in Verse 9 in connection with the three meal-offerings: the one baked in the oven, etc.] as meaning that it shall belong to all pure priests who are present there. Similarly, when He said, <italic>And the priest that offereth any man&#x2019;s burnt-offering</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn455">84</xref></sup> and <italic>the priest that maketh atonement therewith, he shall have it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn456">85</xref></sup> these verses are only intended to say that they do not belong to the owners who brought them, but that in reward for offering them they belong to the pure priests who are present there, for all of them are engaged in offering them, whether physically or by command, since any individual priest or two or three of them who offered up [the particular offering], did so with the permission of all of them and acting as their deputy, and all of them would stand by the offering. <italic>As is the share of him that goeth down to the battle, so shall be the share of him that tarrieth by the baggage; they shall share alike</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn457">86</xref></sup> After He had said [in general terms] that they shall belong to the priests as a reward for their service, He explained it again in detail: <italic>and every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn453">82</xref></sup> which includes all meal-offerings, <italic>shall all the sons of Aaron have</italic>, meaning all the officiating priests mentioned [in the preceding verses], <italic>one as well as another</italic>, that is to say, all clean priests of the Father&#x2019;s House,<sup><xref rid="fn454">83</xref></sup> as they are all the officiating priests mentioned previously. Thus Scripture [first] mentioned the meal-offerings by their individual names &#x2014; the one baked in the oven, or made in the boiling pot, or in the pan &#x2014; and then mentioned them all again in a general rule, saying [that they belong to all the priests], <italic>one as well as another</italic>, meaning that one priest should only have [of the kind of meal-offering] that the other priest has, [and they cannot give one priest his share of one kind of meal-offering, and the others a share of another kind]. Even if the meal-offering was of fine flour, each is to be given his share from that offering.<sup><xref rid="fn458">87</xref></sup> Scripture thus states that this law applies to meal-offerings, and all the more so to the other offerings, which are of greater monetary value. It is tradition which decides [in favor of the Rabbis&#x2019; interpretation mentioned above],<sup><xref rid="fn459">88</xref></sup> and it is furthermore for the benefit of [all] the priests and conducive to peace in the Sanctuary.</p>
<p>It is possible that the interpretation of the verses according to this opinion of the Rabbis is as follows: &#x201C;<italic>And every meal-offering that is baked in the oven, and everything made in the boiling pot, and in the pan, shall be the priest&#x2019;s that offereth it; and every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry</italic> shall [also] be so, and <italic>all the sons of Aaron shall have it, one as well as another</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn460">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. THEN HE SHALL OFFER &#x2018;AL&#x2019; THE OFFERING OF THANKSGIVING. The commentators<sup><xref rid="fn461">90</xref></sup> have explained the word <italic>al</italic> as meaning &#x201C;with&#x201D; &#x2014; <italic>with the offering of thanksgiving</italic>. Similarly, <italic>&#x2018;al&#x2019; the cakes of leavened bread</italic><sup><xref rid="fn462">91</xref></sup> means &#x201C;with them.&#x201D; The correct interpretation appears to me that the word <italic>al</italic> is here to be understood in its ordinary sense [i.e., &#x201C;upon&#x201D;], meaning that he should add bread &#x201C;upon&#x201D; the offering. Similarly, <italic>&#x2018;al&#x2019; the cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn462">91</xref></sup> means that he is to bring cakes of leavened bread, and adding &#x201C;upon&#x201D; them he is to bring <italic>his offering</italic>, which is the unleavened bread mentioned [in Verse 12 before us] &#x2014; all these breads [thirty unleavened cakes and ten leavened ones] he is to bring <italic>upon the offering</italic> [of thanksgiving]. Scripture thus made the leavened bread the chief part of the offering, &#x201C;adding&#x201D; upon it the rest of the bread [i.e., the unleavened bread, by stating &#x201C;upon the cakes of leavened bread he shall present <italic>his offering,&#x201D;</italic> which means &#x201C;his unleavened bread&#x201D;], because the unleavened breads are more than all the other kinds.<sup><xref rid="fn463">92</xref></sup> Scripture changed the expression, stating, [<italic>he shall present his offering</italic>] <italic>of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving</italic><sup><xref rid="fn462">91</xref></sup> [while here in Verse 12 it merely says, <italic>the offering of thanksgiving</italic>], in order to allude to the Rabbis&#x2019; interpretation regarding it, namely that the bread does not become holy in itself [in the sense that it cannot be redeemed, or that it becomes invalid if carried outside the wall of the city, etc.] until the offering is slaughtered, and [also] that it should be slaughtered &#x201C;upon&#x201D; it [the bread], that is to say, with the intention that the bread should become holy with it [the offering].</p>
<p>Now Rashi wrote: &#x201C;<italic>Then he shall bring with the offering of thanksgiving</italic> four sorts of bread: cakes, wafers, and cakes mingled with oil &#x2014; these three kinds being of unleavened bread. And it further states, <italic>with cakes of leavened bread</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn462">91</xref></sup> [thus making four kinds], and each kind consisted of ten cakes. Thus it is explained in Tractate Menachoth.<sup><xref rid="fn464">93</xref></sup> And their total measure was five Jerusalem seahs, which are six measures according to the Wilderness measure,<sup><xref rid="fn465">94</xref></sup> or twenty tenths [of the ephah].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn466">95</xref></sup> Now the Rabbi [Rashi] did not mention in connection with these twenty tenths [of flour] that ten of them were for the leavened cakes, a tenth for each one, and the other ten tenths for the unleavened ones, thus making three unleavened cakes to each tenth of flour.<sup><xref rid="fn467">96</xref></sup> The Rabbis interpreted that this is so on the basis of the verse, <italic>&#x2018;al&#x2019; cakes of leavened bread</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn462">91</xref></sup> [which they explained<sup><xref rid="fn464">93</xref></sup> as meaning]: &#x201C; &#x2018;Corresponding to&#x2019; [the amount of flour used in the preparation of the ten] leavened cakes, use the same amount to bring therefrom [the thirty] unleavened cakes. Thus there were twenty tenths [of an ephah of flour], ten for the leavened cakes and ten for the unleavened. Ten tenths were used for the leavened ones, thus making one tenth of flour for each of [the ten] leavened cakes, and ten tenths for the unleavened ones, thus making three cakes to one tenth of flour. Thus there were forty cakes altogether.&#x201D;</p>
<p>14. AND OF IT HE SHALL PRESENT ONE OUT OF EACH OFFERING &#x2014; one whole cake [for <italic>a heave-offering unto the Eternal</italic>]. Thus he takes as a heave-offering four cakes [and gives them to the priest].</p>
<p>But I wonder&#x0021; When Scripture excluded [first-fruits] from the prohibition against burning leaven [on the altar],<sup><xref rid="fn468">97</xref></sup> by stating, <italic>as an offering of first-fruits ye may bring them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn469">98</xref></sup> [which means that &#x201C;the two loaves&#x201D; of the Festival of Shevuoth were to be brought of leavened dough, as clearly mentioned further on in Scripture],<sup><xref rid="fn470">99</xref></sup> why did it not say that [the ten leavened cakes of] the thanks-offering [are also an exception]? But this is not really a question. For Scripture states, <italic>and unto the altar they</italic> [i.e., leaven and honey] <italic>shall not come up for a sweet savor</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn469">98</xref></sup> and of the [forty] breads of the thanks-offering, none came up on the altar at all, for they require only waving.<sup><xref rid="fn471">100</xref></sup> Even though in the case of the showbread<sup><xref rid="fn472">101</xref></sup> He did say that one commits a transgression if one brought it in a leaven state<sup><xref rid="fn473">102</xref></sup> [although there too none of the loaves are burnt on the altar], that is because of the frankincense that was on it which was <italic>to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn474">103</xref></sup> But of the bread of the thanks-offering, nothing at all came up on the altar [hence the Torah permitted the ten loaves to be leavened]. Perhaps Scripture only had to mention that exception [<italic>as an offering of first-fruits ye may bring them</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn469">98</xref></sup> because of the honey,<sup><xref rid="fn475">104</xref></sup> since it was not clearly stated concerning the first-fruits [which were brought of &#x201C;the seven kinds&#x201D;]<sup><xref rid="fn476">105</xref></sup> that they may be brought from honey [and it therefore had to be explicitly stated in that verse], and thus He also included leaven with it, saying of both of them, <italic>as an offering of first-fruits ye may bring them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn469">98</xref></sup> With reference to leaven, however, since it is clearly explained in its correct place [that the &#x201C;two loaves&#x201D; of the Festival of Shevuoth constitute an exception to the usual negative commandment], there was no need any more to mention it as an exception [when mentioning the general negative commandment], just as Scripture has not specified the exception to the rule about the Sabbath, when stating <italic>every one that profaneth it shall be put to death</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn477">106</xref></sup> [by saying] &#x201C;except for the Service of the offerings&#x201D; [which may be done on the Sabbath], or in the case of <italic>thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother&#x2019;s wife</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn478">107</xref></sup> [by saying] &#x201C;except for a brother&#x2019;s childless wife&#x201D; [whom he is to marry].<sup><xref rid="fn479">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND THE FLESH OF THE OFFERING OF HIS PEACE-OFFERINGS FOR THANKSGIVING SHALL BE EATEN ON THE DAY OF HIS OFFERING. &#x201C;There are here many terms of amplification [all the seemingly redundant words thus being intended to widen the scope of the law]. Thus they include in this law the sin-offering and guilt-offering, the Nazirite&#x2019;s ram,<sup><xref rid="fn480">109</xref></sup> and the Festal-offering of the fourteenth day of Nisan,<sup><xref rid="fn481">110</xref></sup> that they may all be eaten for a day and a night.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But it is not correct, for the Festal-offering of the fourteenth day of Nisan may be eaten for two days and the one intervening night, like the rest of the peace-offerings. So also we have been taught in Tractate Pesachim:<sup><xref rid="fn482">111</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Neither shall any of the flesh, which thou offerest on the first day at even, remain all night until the morning</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn483">112</xref></sup> Scripture speaks here of the Festal-offering of the fourteenth day of Nisan, teaching that it may be eaten for two days and the one intervening night,<sup><xref rid="fn484">113</xref></sup> and when Scripture states <italic>on the first day &#x2026; until the morning</italic>, it means the second morning.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn485">114</xref></sup> Rashi himself wrote this in the <italic>Seder R&#x2019;eih Anochi</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn483">112</xref></sup> Here, however, the Rabbi [Rashi] follows the words of Ben Teima,<sup><xref rid="fn482">111</xref></sup> who says that the Festal-offering of the fourteenth of Nisan which comes with the Passover-offering,<sup><xref rid="fn481">110</xref></sup> is like the Passover-offering, and may be eaten [only] on that day [the fourteenth of Nisan] and the following night, and may be eaten only roasted and until midnight, [like the Passover-offering] which is eaten only at night [but not on the fourteenth day]. But according to Ben Teima, these amplifications [referred to by Rashi] only come to indicate that it [the Festal-offering accompanying the Passover-offering] is like the Passover-offering in every respect, coming only from the sheep, a male of the first year,<sup><xref rid="fn486">115</xref></sup> since it is written, <italic>Neither shall the offering of the feast of the Passover be left unto the morning</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn487">116</xref></sup> [which Ben Teima interpreted to mean: &#x201C;<italic>the offering of the feast</italic>, namely the Festal-offering; <italic>of the Passover</italic>, namely the Passover-offering,&#x201D; the same law thus applying to both], as it is stated there.<sup><xref rid="fn488">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>But that which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote here [namely, that the terms of amplification of the verse teach that the Festal-offering is to be eaten only for a day and a night] is on the basis of a Beraitha<sup><xref rid="fn489">118</xref></sup> taught in the Torath Kohanim,<sup><xref rid="fn490">119</xref></sup> which states as follows: &#x201C;<italic>And the flesh of the offering of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving, shall be eaten on the day of his offering</italic>. This verse comes to teach that those offerings which Scripture states are to be eaten for one day [and the following night] may only be eaten during that time [and not for two days and the intervening night, as is the period assigned for the peace-offering]. I would only know that such is the law for the thanks-offering [i.e., the offering itself, which is mentioned explicitly in the verse]. Whence do I know to include the breads thereof? Scripture therefore says, <italic>his offering</italic>. Whence do I know to include the offspring of the thanks-offering and animals substituted for it in the same law? Scripture therefore says, <italic>&#x2018;and&#x2019; the flesh</italic>. Whence do I know to include the sin-offerings and guilt-offering [that they, too, may be eaten only during the day and the ensuing night]? Scripture therefore says, <italic>the offering</italic>. Whence do I know to include the Nazirite&#x2019;s peace-offering,<sup><xref rid="fn480">109</xref></sup> and the peace-offerings which come on account of the Passover-offering? Scripture therefore says, <italic>his peace-offerings</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This is the Beraitha<sup><xref rid="fn489">118</xref></sup> [taught in the Torath Kohanim]. Now the Rabbi [Rashi] explained<sup><xref rid="fn491">120</xref></sup> the phrase &#x201C;the peace-offerings which come on account of the Passover-offering&#x201D; as referring to the Festal-offering of the fourteenth day of Nisan, which comes together with the Passover-offering, [thus providing the authority for his comment here that the Festal-offering of the fourteenth of Nisan may be eaten only during the day and ensuing night.] Thus also I have found in Tractate Pesachim, in the Chapter <italic>Mi Shehayah</italic> (If any man shall be unclean),<sup><xref rid="fn492">121</xref></sup> that Rashi gave two explanations of this phrase &#x2014; &#x201C;the peace-offerings which come on account of the Passover-offering&#x201D; &#x2014; and wrote [after explaining the first interpretation]: &#x201C;Another explanation is that it means the Festal-offering of the fourteenth. This explanation I have heard.&#x201D; Here then [in his commentary on the Torah] the Rabbi relied on the interpretation he had heard [and consequently he wrote that the Festal-offering of the fourteenth may be eaten only for one day and the following night].</p>
<p>But the matter is not so. [The correct explanation of the phrase] &#x201C;peace-offerings which come on account of the Passover-offering,&#x201D; is that it refers to [those animals] which remain over from the Passover-offering,<sup><xref rid="fn493">122</xref></sup> such as where the owners substituted another one for it, or where the owners of a Passover-offering fulfilled their duty<sup><xref rid="fn494">123</xref></sup> by bringing another offering. [In these cases they are to be eaten only for one day and the ensuing night], as since they were at the beginning only meant to be eaten for one day and the ensuing night, [namely the night following the day on which they were slaughtered, as is the law of all Passover-offerings], so also in the end [i.e., when they are offered up as peace-offerings they are to be eaten only for one day and the ensuing night]. But the Festal-offering of the fourteenth [since it is not originally brought as a Passover-offering], is eaten for two days [and the intervening night] in accordance with the words of the Sages. So also we have been taught in that very same Beraitha<sup><xref rid="fn490">119</xref></sup> at the end thereof: &#x201C;<italic>And on the morrow</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn495">124</xref></sup> This verse comes to teach that those offerings which [Scripture states] are to be eaten for two days [and the intervening night] may only be eaten during that time. I know only that this applies to the peace-offering [which is clearly mentioned in the verse]. Whence do I know to include the Festal-offering which comes at its proper time [i.e., the regular Festal-offering of the <italic>fifteenth</italic> day of Nisan]? etc. Now I know to include the Festal-offering which comes at its regular time. Whence do I know to include the Festal-offering which comes with the Passover-offering [that it may be eaten only for two days and the intervening night]? etc.&#x201D; [Thus it is clearly stated that the Festal-offering of the <italic>fourteenth</italic> may be eaten for only two days and the intervening night, and not as Rashi wrote that it may be eaten only for one day and the following night].</p>
<p>16. AND ON THE MORROW &#x2018;V&#x2019;HANOTHAR&#x2019; (AND THAT WHICH REMAINETH) OF IT SHALL BE EATEN. &#x201C;The letter <italic>vav</italic> [in the word <italic>v&#x2019;hanothar</italic> &#x2014; &#x2018;and&#x2019; that which remaineth] is redundant [thus the meaning of the verse is: &#x201C;and on the morrow, that which remaineth of it shall be eaten&#x201D;]. There are many examples of this in Scripture, such as: <italic>and these are the children of Zibeon: &#x2018;v&#x2019;ayah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and Ajah</italic>) <italic>and Anah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn496">125</xref></sup> So also: <italic>to give &#x2018;v&#x2019;kodesh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;and&#x2019; the Sanctuary</italic>) <italic>and the host to be trampled upon</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn497">126</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, and so did Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra interpret the verse.</p>
<p>In my opinion the meaning of the verse is as follows: Since He said, <italic>it shall be eaten on the day that he offereth his offering, and on the morrow</italic>, this might imply that it is a commandment that it [the peace-offering] be eaten in two days, [namely] that he should eat part of it on the first day, and should leave part of it to be eaten on the morrow. Therefore He explained again, <italic>&#x2018;and&#x2019; that which remaineth</italic> is to be eaten on the first day and also on the morrow [if by chance it was not all eaten on the first day]. But he is not to leave some over intentionally, nor is he permitted to leave it all over to be eaten on the second day. Rather, it is a commandment that he should eat it on the first day, and that which is left over by chance, should be eaten on the morrow previously mentioned.</p>
<p>This matter we have learned from the words of our Rabbis, who have said in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn498">127</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>On the day that he offereth it, shall it be eaten</italic>. It is a commandment that it be eaten thereof during the first day. I might think that he is commanded to eat the whole of it; Scripture therefore says, <italic>and on the morrow</italic>. I might then think that it is a commandment to eat it in two days; Scripture therefore states, <italic>and that which remaineth</italic> &#x2014; if it remains, it remains [i.e., it may still be eaten]. If [we are to go by the expression] <italic>and that which remaineth</italic>, I might think that if he left it all over for the second day it is invalid [since that does not come under the term &#x201C;remaineth&#x201D; which indicates only a part thereof]; Scripture therefore says [<italic>that which remaineth of it</italic>] <italic>shall be eaten</italic>, even all of it.&#x201D; And even if you hold the <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>v&#x2019;hanothar</italic> (and that which remaineth) to be redundant, [as Rashi explained], the verse can also be explained to mean: &#x201C;and on the morrow that which remained of it [from the first day] may be eaten,&#x201D; but not that he is to leave it over intentionally.</p>
<p>But I do not know why Rashi held the <italic>vav</italic> of the verse, <italic>to give &#x2018;v&#x2019;kodesh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;and&#x2019; the Sanctuary</italic>) <italic>and the host to be trampled upon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn497">126</xref></sup> to be redundant, since the meaning of the verse is that [the angel] is asking: &#x201C;How long shall the transgression give appalment, and how long shall the Sanctuary and the host be trampled underfoot?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn499">128</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND THAT WHICH REMAINETH OF THE FLESH OF THE OFFERING ON THE THIRD DAY SHALL BE BURNT WITH FIRE. The verse does not mean to say that that which is left over on the third day must be burnt, but it may be eaten during the preceding night, for our Rabbis have already derived from the verse in the section of <italic>Kedoshim Tih&#x2019;yu &#x2014; and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn500">129</xref></sup> that whatever remains after any part of the two days, must be burnt [and thus may not be eaten on the night preceding the third day]. But the expression, <italic>on the third day</italic>, is not connected with <italic>that which remaineth</italic>, but with <italic>shall be burnt with fire</italic> [the sense of the verse thus being as follows: &#x201C;and that which remaineth of the flesh of the offering, shall be burnt with fire on the third day&#x201D;]. The verse thus states that that which was left over of the flesh of the offering which was not eaten on the day when it was offered nor on the morrow, shall be burnt with fire on the third day in the morning. It is this which the Rabbis intended when saying [of the peace-offerings]<sup><xref rid="fn501">130</xref></sup> that &#x201C;they are eaten for two days and the one intervening night,&#x201D; for on the second night [preceding the third day] they are neither eaten nor burnt, for Scripture required that the burning of invalidated hallowed offerings should be at daytime, just as the offering of the valid ones can only be at daytime.</p>
<p>21. OR AN UNCLEAN BEAST. Scripture speaks here briefly, mentioning only some of the unclean objects. But the same law applies to all [sources of uncleanness], for even if he touched the carcass of a clean animal and then ate holy food, he is liable to this [punishment of] excision. The nature of this excision I will explain in the section of forbidden marriages,<sup><xref rid="fn502">131</xref></sup> with the help of G-d.</p>
<p>25. FOR WHOSOEVER EATETH THE FAT OF THE BEAST, OF WHICH MAN PRESENTS AN OFFERING &#x2026; SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM HIS PEOPLE. It is impossible that the explanation of the phrase: <italic>of the beast</italic> [<italic>of which man presents an offering</italic>], is that this beast is itself an offering, so that an unconsecrated animal be excluded from this prohibition, since in the section of <italic>Vayikra</italic>, Scripture has already prohibited all fat in an unqualified manner,<sup><xref rid="fn503">132</xref></sup> without any condition or exception. Here too it prohibited at first <italic>all fat of ox, or sheep, or goat</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn504">133</xref></sup> and it further decreed against eating <italic>the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn505">134</xref></sup> and these cannot be brought as offerings to G-d. Besides, He said there [in the section of <italic>Vayikra</italic>], <italic>It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn506">135</xref></sup> and the expression <italic>in all your dwellings</italic> is never found in any matter connected with offerings. In speaking of the gifts of the priests He says many times, <italic>a statute forever</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn507">136</xref></sup> but does not mention &#x201C;in all your dwellings,&#x201D; because the offerings are not &#x201C;a statute forever in all your dwellings,&#x201D; as they only apply in the Tabernacle and <italic>in the place which the Eternal shall choose</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn508">137</xref></sup></p>
<p>Let not the eyes of him who is mistaken<sup><xref rid="fn509">138</xref></sup> be blinded by the verse, <italic>And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the offering of your G-d; it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn510">139</xref></sup> For it is eating of the new crop that is forbidden by law of the Torah in all places, and Scripture is saying that we are not to eat bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears forever in all our dwelling places, until that same day on which we bring the offering of the new barley in the Sanctuary. If the offering is not brought [as when the Sanctuary is destroyed], it does not become forbidden henceforth to eat of the new crop [i.e., after the end of the sixteenth day of Nisan], for He did not say, &#x201C;ye shall not eat until ye have brought the offering of your G-d,&#x201D; but instead the prohibition extends <italic>until this selfsame day</italic> only. Rather, the meaning of <italic>until this selfsame day</italic> is the one on which you bring the offering when you are in a position to do so, the reason being that the offering should be a new meal-offering [but when you are not able to bring the offering, as when the Sanctuary is destroyed, the prohibition is only <italic>until this selfsame day</italic>]. It is possible that the word <italic>hayom</italic> (<italic>the day</italic>) is connected also with [the latter part of the verse:] &#x201C;<italic>until this selfsame day, until the day ye have brought the offering of your G-d</italic>,&#x201D; [thus clearly indicating that the prohibition depends on the <italic>day</italic> the offering is brought, and not on the actual bringing thereof].</p>
<p>The complete proof that the explanation of the phrase [in the verse before us] <italic>the beast of which man presents an offering</italic>, is &#x201C;of the kind of beast from which man presents an offering,&#x201D; [and not &#x201C;of the beast which is itself an actual offering,&#x201D; so that the unconsecrated beast would be excluded from the prohibition against eating of the fat thereof,] is that it says also in the section on valuations, <italic>And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the Eternal, all that any man giveth of such unto the Eternal shall be holy</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn511">140</xref></sup> and it explains that this means the kind of beast whereof men bring an offering to G-d. And so also, <italic>And if it be any unclean beast, of which they may not bring an offering unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn512">141</xref></sup> here clearly stating, &#x201C;any unclean beast of the kind from which offerings are not brought.&#x201D; There is no difference whatever between stating it in the plural &#x2014; <italic>whereof men bring</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn511">140</xref></sup> <italic>of which they may not bring</italic><sup><xref rid="fn512">141</xref></sup> &#x2014; or saying it in the singular [as in the verse before us], <italic>of which man presents</italic>, for the meaning is &#x201C;the kind of beast of which man presents an offering.&#x201D; Similarly He said, <italic>And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn513">142</xref></sup> which means the kind of beast of which ye may eat, but not that the particular beast may be eaten [since it is expressly prohibited as meat, as it died without being slaughtered properly].</p>
<p>Now since He prohibited all fat of a beast whereof an offering is brought, but not of the kind of which offerings are not brought, it might enter one&#x2019;s mind to say that a beast which died of itself or was torn [by other beasts] is regarded as a kind from which offerings may not be brought [and therefore their fats may be eaten]; therefore it was necessary to mention [in Verse 24] that [the fats of these animals] are forbidden, and it is this which He said, <italic>and ye shall in no wise eat of it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn505">134</xref></sup> meaning that he who eats it is liable to excision as with all other fats, as He forbade the fat of the entire class of beasts from which offerings are brought, even of those animals which died of themselves or were torn by [wild] beasts. He states, <italic>they may be used for any other service</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn505">134</xref></sup> meaning to say that [the fat of a clean animal which died of itself or was torn by beasts] has no law of uncleanness of carrion [but is like ordinary food which has become unclean],<sup><xref rid="fn514">143</xref></sup> for since He said, <italic>and their carcasses ye shall not touch</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn515">144</xref></sup> He states concerning the fat thereof that one may touch it and use it for any other service. Now if the prohibition of eating fat would apply only to that of actual offerings, why was it necessary to say there in the section of <italic>Vayikra, Ye shall not eat any fat</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn503">132</xref></sup> when He had already commanded [in the preceding verse] that it be brought up on the altar <italic>as a sweet savor</italic>, and how could we eat of the fire-offering of G-d? Why did He not also prohibit the eating of the lobe above the liver and the two kidneys, which are removed from the offerings [and burnt on the altar &#x2014; yet these may be eaten in the case of ordinary clean animals because they do not come under the term <italic>cheilev</italic> (fat)].<sup><xref rid="fn516">145</xref></sup> Moreover, why was it necessary to mention here, <italic>Ye shall eat no fat of ox, or sheep, or goat</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn504">133</xref></sup> when it is known that offerings can be brought only from them [it thus being obvious that the prohibition of <italic>cheilev</italic> applies to all clean animals &#x2014; hallowed or unhallowed]&#x0021; The reason why Scripture said concerning dedicated offerings that became invalidated [because of a blemish they received, in which case they are redeemed and may then be slaughtered and eaten as ordinary food], <italic>Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn517">146</xref></sup> and did not mention anything concerning the fat, I shall explain when G-d helps me to reach there.</p>
<p>30. THE FAT UPON THE BREAST. It appears from this verse according to its plain meaning that the breast was waved with the fat, but not the thigh. Thus the verse which states, <italic>And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn518">147</xref></sup> means that afterwards [after he had waved the fats with the breasts], he waved them [i.e., the breasts and the thigh] by themselves. But our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn519">148</xref></sup> that the priest placed the fats upon the hand of the owner of the offering, with the breast and thigh above them, [and waved them]. According to their opinion, the reason why waving is mentioned only in connection with the breast, is in order to serve the basis for the interpretation which they have said: &#x201C;If [the parts which are to be waved] became unclean, but one of them was left [which remained clean], whence do we know that it needs waving? Scripture therefore says, <italic>that the breast may be waved</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn520">149</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. WHICH THE ETERNAL COMMANDED TO BE GIVEN THEM IN THE DAY THAT THEY WERE ANOINTED. The order of the verse is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn521">150</xref></sup> &#x201C;Which the Eternal commanded, on the day that they were anointed, to be given them from the children of Israel, by a statute forever.&#x201D; And the explanation of the phrase <italic>in the day that they were anointed</italic>, is &#x201C;at the time of the anointment.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>in the day when they were presented to minister</italic><sup><xref rid="fn522">151</xref></sup> means: &#x201C;at that time when He separated them&#x201D; [to minister as priests]. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that &#x201C; &#x2018;<italic>b&#x2019;yom</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>in the day</italic>) <italic>that they were anointed</italic> means <italic>mi&#x2019;yom</italic> (<italic>from the day</italic>) that they were anointed.<sup><xref rid="fn523">152</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>and that which remaineth &#x2018;babasar ubalachem</italic>&#x2019; [literally: &#x201C;in the meat and in the bread&#x201D;]<sup><xref rid="fn524">153</xref></sup> means <italic>mibasar umilechem</italic> (&#x201C;of the meat and of the bread&#x201D;).</p>
<p>38. WHICH THE ETERNAL COMMANDED MOSES IN MOUNT SINAI. According to our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn525">154</xref></sup> all the commandments were expressly told to Moses on Mount Sinai, in their general rules, their specific regulations and their minute details, and some of them were repeated in the Tent of Meeting. Thus [all] the commandments in the Book of Vayikra (Leviticus) [which is prefaced by the verse stating it was made known in the Tent of Meeting], are repetitions [of those said on Sinai, which is the sense of the verse before us]. By way of the plain meaning of Scripture, the meaning of the verse is:<sup><xref rid="fn526">155</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Which the Eternal commanded Moses in Mount Sinai</italic>, and <italic>in the day that he commanded the children of Israel</italic> in the wilderness of Sinai <italic>to present their offerings unto the Eternal</italic>,&#x201D; for He gave the commandment about the consecration-offerings [of the priests] <italic>in Mount Sinai</italic>, as also in the case of the burnt-offering and sin-offering [which were part of the consecration], and He commanded concerning the meal-offering, guilt-offering, and peace-offerings, <italic>in the wilderness of Sinai</italic>, in the Tent of Meeting.</p>
<p>It is possible that the expression <italic>in Mount Sinai</italic> means &#x201C;in this place in front of Mount Sinai,&#x201D; which is in the Tent of Meeting. Similarly, <italic>It is a continual burnt-offering, which was offered in Mount Sinai</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn527">156</xref></sup> does not mean on the mountain itself, for the continual burnt-offering [i.e., the Daily Whole-offering brought for all Israel] began only in the Tent of Meeting, as it is written, <italic>Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs of the first year day by day continually</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn528">157</xref></sup> So also: <italic>And they set forward from the Mount of the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn529">158</xref></sup> [which means &#x201C;from before the Mount of the Eternal&#x201D;]; <italic>ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain</italic><sup><xref rid="fn530">159</xref></sup> [which means &#x201C;in front of this mountain&#x201D;]. The sense of all these verses is that Israel had encamped before Mount Sinai nearby, as it is written, <italic>and there Israel encamped before the Mount</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn531">160</xref></sup> There [in the wilderness of Sinai] they stayed until they journeyed from there to the wilderness of Paran.<sup><xref rid="fn532">161</xref></sup> Thus they made the Tent of Meeting and erected it before the Mount on its east side, and it was there that they began offering the Daily Whole-offering. In the second year [after the exodus] they were commanded concerning the standards,<sup><xref rid="fn533">162</xref></sup> and they set the Tent of Meeting <italic>in the midst of the camps</italic><sup><xref rid="fn534">163</xref></sup> when they journeyed. It is for this reason that Scripture says here that <italic>this is the law of the burnt-offering</italic><sup><xref rid="fn535">164</xref></sup> and of all the offerings which G-d commanded [Moses] <italic>in Mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded</italic> [<italic>the children of Israel</italic>] &#x2026; <italic>in the wilderness of Sinai</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn536">165</xref></sup> Scripture thus states that it was in Mount Sinai and in the desert of Sinai, in order to inform us that it was not on the mountain itself, in the place of the Glory where G-d told to Moses the Ten Commandments, nor in the desert of Sinai after they had journeyed from before the Mount. Rather, it was in the wilderness of Sinai, in front of the mountain within its environs and nearby, and there was the Tent of Meeting, as He said at the beginning of the subject of the offerings, <italic>And He called unto Moses, and the Eternal spoke unto him out of the Tent of Meeting</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn537">166</xref></sup> and now He informed us of the place of the Tent of Meeting.</p>
<h1>8</h1>
<p>2. TAKE AARON. &#x201C;This section [concerning the seven days of consecration of the priests] was said seven days before the [final] erection of the Tabernacle [which took place on the first day of Nisan],<sup><xref rid="fn538">167</xref></sup> for there is no strict chronological order in the narrative of the Torah.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn539">168</xref></sup> Thus the language of Rashi. But why should we invert the words of the living G-d&#x0021; Moreover, in the section of <italic>On the first day of the first month</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn540">169</xref></sup> He commanded concerning the erection of the whole Tabernacle, the clothing of Aaron and his sons and the anointing of all of them, and there He narrated Moses&#x2019; deeds in the matter of the erection of the Tabernacle,<sup><xref rid="fn541">170</xref></sup> but did not mention anything concerning Aaron and his sons till here. And how could it be that He separated one subject into two sections, [as follows from Rashi], placing the later one [i.e., the final erection of the Tabernacle which took place on the first of Nisan, as recorded in the Book of Exodus], before the earlier one [i.e., the seven days of consecration that began on the twenty-third of Adar which He placed here in the Book of Leviticus]&#x0021;</p>
<p>Rather, the correct interpretation is that we say that Moses was commanded about the erection of the Tabernacle on the twenty-third day of Adar, and he erected it [on that day]. As soon as the Tabernacle stood in its position G-d, blessed be He, <italic>Who sitteth upon the cherubim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn542">171</xref></sup> called Moses and commanded him about the actions involved in the bringing of the offerings &#x2014; all those sections from the beginning of the Book of <italic>Vayikra</italic> until here. [This was because] He wanted to teach him the actions and statutes of all the offerings before he offered up any of them, since among the initiation-offerings were the sin-offering, burnt-offering and peace-offering, and they could only know all their laws from these sections with which He preceded [to command <italic>him</italic>]. Afterwards He said to him, <italic>Take Aaron and his sons with him</italic> etc., to urge him on when the time came for performing what He had told him at first &#x2014; <italic>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto Me etc</italic>.,<sup><xref rid="fn543">172</xref></sup> adding here, <italic>And assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the Tent of Meeting</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn544">173</xref></sup> so that it should be done in the presence of all of them, that they should know that G-d, blessed be He, chose Aaron and his sons [to minister unto Him].</p>
<p>By way of the proper interpretation of Scripture, Moses was commanded about the building of the Tabernacle prior to the incident of the golden calf [as is the order of these chapters in the Book of Exodus],<sup><xref rid="fn545">174</xref></sup> and when the Holy One, blessed be He, became reconciled to him and promised him that He would cause His Divine Glory to dwell among them, Moses understood of his own accord that the command concerning the Tabernacle remained valid as before, and he then commanded Israel regarding it, as I have explained in the section of <italic>Vayakheil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn546">175</xref></sup> After they had completed the work, he was then told the section of <italic>On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn547">176</xref></sup> and he was then told, <italic>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the Tent of Meeting</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn548">177</xref></sup> Thus Moses knew that Aaron and his sons also remained in their esteemed and beloved position before G-d. Here He urged them again on the first day of the consecration, at the time of performing the command [<italic>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons</italic> etc.]<sup><xref rid="fn548">177</xref></sup> Thus all the sections of the Torah are in chronological order, except that He placed before its sequence the verse, <italic>And the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn549">178</xref></sup> which in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn550">179</xref></sup> was on the eighth day of the initiation, in order to arrange in order the whole matter of the erection of the Tabernacle, it being the customary way of Scripture in all places to finish a subject that it has started to explain.<sup><xref rid="fn551">180</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND HE WASHED THEM WITH WATER. It appears likely to me that Scripture tells that he [Moses] washed all of them, but nonetheless it was not done to all of them together. Rather, he washed Aaron and clothed him with his garments and anointed him, and afterwards he washed his sons and anointed them.</p>
<p>7. AND HE PUT UPON HIM THE TUNIC AND HE GIRDED HIM WITH THE BELT. This was the order in which Moses did it. But in the section containing the command, He said, <italic>and thou shalt put upon Aaron the tunic, and the robe of the ephod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn552">181</xref></sup> [and mentioned the belt only later on in the section, and not right after the tunic, as here], because there He wanted to mention the belt for Aaron and his sons in one command, saying, <italic>And thou shalt gird them with belts, Aaron and his sons</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn553">182</xref></sup> Thus Moses clothed Aaron with the tunic and the belt, and afterwards with the robe and the ephod, in the order mentioned there.<sup><xref rid="fn554">183</xref></sup> Here [when performing the command] <italic>he girded him with the skilfully-woven band of the ephod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn555">184</xref></sup> before he placed the breastplate upon him,<sup><xref rid="fn556">185</xref></sup> [while in the section containing the command the breastplate is mentioned <italic>before</italic> the skilfully-woven band of the ephod], for Moses knew that the usual way of dressing is that immediately after putting on a garment, one girds it with the belt made for it. Therefore, he girded him with the belt immediately after the tunic, and with the skilfully-woven band [of the ephod] immediately after the ephod, it being improper that the putting on of the ephod should be done with intermissions. But there [in the section containing the command] it is said, <italic>and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the skilfully-woven band of the ephod</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn554">183</xref></sup> because He dealt briefly there with the subject of the breastplate, and did not say that it be placed on the ephod, nor that he should put in it the Urim and the Thummim,<sup><xref rid="fn557">186</xref></sup> since He had already commanded all this in explaining the work of the ephod and the breastplate.</p>
<p>10. AND MOSES TOOK THE ANOINTING OIL, AND ANOINTED THE TABERNACLE &#x2026; 12. AND HE POURED OF THE ANOINTING OIL UPON AARON&#x2019;S HEAD. This too<sup><xref rid="fn558">187</xref></sup> Moses did in the proper order, for so he was commanded [in the section on the making] of the oil of anointment: <italic>And thou shalt anoint therewith the Tent of Meeting</italic> etc., <italic>and thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn559">188</xref></sup> Therefore Moses did not want to anoint the Tabernacle until he had clothed Aaron, and then he anointed them together, so that the one who is to perform the Divine Service should be ready, as it were, to come at once into the Sanctuary to minister. It sufficed to do so in the case of Aaron, for he was <italic>the holy one of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn560">189</xref></sup> although in the command regarding the erecting of the Tabernacle it is written, <italic>and thou shalt anoint the Tabernacle, and all that is therein</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn561">190</xref></sup> and afterwards, <italic>and thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shalt wash them with water. And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn562">191</xref></sup> for there He arranged all that was done to Aaron and his sons in one verse.<sup><xref rid="fn563">192</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND HE SPRINKLED THEREOF [i.e., of the anointing oil] UPON THE ALTAR. Rashi commented: &#x201C;I do not know where Moses was commanded about these sprinklings.&#x201D; It is possible that that which He said of the altar, <italic>and thou shalt sanctify the altar, and the altar shall be most holy</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn564">193</xref></sup> means that he should add this sanctification to the altar through the sprinklings [of the anointing oil], and it could not be done merely by anointing the altar, for the expression <italic>and the altar shall be most holy</italic>, means that he should give it an additional sanctity above that of the other anointed things in the Tabernacle and all its vessels. Moses thus sanctified the altar in the same way that he was commanded to do to the ministering priests, concerning whom He said, <italic>and thou shalt sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn565">194</xref></sup> since the altar, which is the vessel for the offerings, is not of a lesser degree of holiness than the garments of the ministering priests, and it is an inference from minor to major [that if the garments had to be sprinkled with the anointing oil, surely the altar, being more holy, had to be sprinkled]&#x0021; And so also is it said with reference to the Day of Atonement, <italic>And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it</italic> [the altar] <italic>with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn566">195</xref></sup> Thus [we see that] all sanctifications of the altar were done by sprinklings, and it follows all the more so that [when the altar was consecrated] at the very beginning that it had to be sanctified by sprinkling from uncleanness and &#x201C;strangeness&#x201D; [i.e., from that which is not holy].</p>
<p>Scripture did not mention here [in Verse 13] the anointing of Aaron&#x2019;s sons, for it is self-evident that Moses did to them as he did to their father, in accordance with that which he was commanded, <italic>And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn567">196</xref></sup> and He included it here in saying with reference to the sons that everything was done <italic>as the Eternal commanded Moses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn568">197</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears to me that the anointing of Aaron&#x2019;s sons was not done by means of pouring the oil on their heads, for that is said only of Aaron, <italic>Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his</italic> [Aaron&#x2019;s] <italic>head, and anoint him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn569">198</xref></sup> but the anointing of the sons is not mentioned there at all, as it was not done by means of pouring the oil as in Aaron&#x2019;s case. It is [also] possible that there was no anointing of the sons, except for the sprinklings which Moses sprinkled on Aaron&#x2019;s sons and their garments from the oil of anointment. Thus you see in the section of <italic>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn570">199</xref></sup> that He commanded to anoint the father [i.e., Aaron], as it says, <italic>Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn569">198</xref></sup> but did not command to anoint the sons at all, either by pouring of the oil, or by anointing. However, in the section of the erection of the Tabernacle He says, <italic>And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn567">196</xref></sup> because He did not mention the sprinklings there at all, [hence He mentioned &#x201C;anointing,&#x201D; whilst referring really to sprinkling]. Similarly, in the section of the oil of anointment [the verse mentions anointing of Aaron and his sons<sup><xref rid="fn559">188</xref></sup> because it does not mention the sprinklings at all]. But <italic>both</italic> sprinkling and anointing are nowhere mentioned with reference to the sons of Aaron in one place. Therefore I say that he only did one of the two to them, namely, the sprinklings.</p>
<p>15. AND HE PURIFIED THE ALTAR. &#x201C;He cleansed it and purified it from anything &#x2018;strange&#x2019; [not holy], so that it might enter into a state of holiness. AND HE SANCTIFIED IT by this rite. TO MAKE ATONEMENT UPON IT &#x2014; from that time onward for all atonements of sin.&#x201D; This is the language of Rashi.</p>
<p>If this is so, then Scripture is saying that by these means the altar was hallowed and made fit to effect atonement upon from that time onward. This is similar to that which is said in the Book of Ezekiel, <italic>Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; so shall they consecrate it. And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings, and I will accept you, saith the Eternal G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn571">200</xref></sup> Here He teaches that this consecration is done with blood, but the burning of the fats is no hindrance to the consecration of the altar, for in succeeding generations too it is no hindrance to the atonement [if the fats of the offering were not burnt on the altar].</p>
<p>But in the Tosephta of the section of consecration<sup><xref rid="fn572">201</xref></sup> I have seen [the following text]: &#x201C;I know not what is this atonement for the altar. [I must say that] from here<sup><xref rid="fn573">202</xref></sup> you learn that this atonement was only necessary because Moses said: &#x2018;When the call was issued to bring freewill donations for the Sanctuary, the people pressured each other, both men and women, and some donated without their complete will; let this be an atonement so that they should not donate to the Sanctuary anything which had been taken by force.&#x2019; And so it also says, <italic>For I the Eternal love justice, I hate robbery in a burnt-offering</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn574">203</xref></sup> Rashi has also mentioned this already in the section of <italic>V&#x2019;atah Tetzaveh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn575">204</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND THE BULLOCK, &#x2018;V&#x2019;ETH ORO&#x2019;(AND ITS SKIN), AND ITS FLESH, AND ITS DUNG, HE BURNT WITH FIRE. Included in the term &#x201C;the bullock&#x201D; are those parts which were burnt that are not included in &#x201C;the flesh,&#x201D; namely the bones, sinews, horns, and hoofs, besides its skin, its flesh, and its dung. Or perhaps the <italic>vav</italic> [in the word <italic>v&#x2019;eth &#x2014; v&#x2019;eth oro</italic> (&#x2018;and&#x2019; its skin)] is one of those redundant letters [thus making the sense of the verse: &#x201C;and the bullock &#x2014; its skin, and its flesh, etc.&#x201D;], it being similar to the verse, <italic>And the heifer shall be burnt in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall be burnt</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn576">205</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND THE RAM WAS CUT INTO PIECES. This cutting into pieces was done only after flaying, but Scripture shortened its account here by omitting the flaying, since He had already commanded about it in the section of the burnt-offering.<sup><xref rid="fn577">206</xref></sup> He states [here in this verse], <italic>and Moses caused the head, and the pieces to burn</italic> [on the altar], which means &#x201C;at the time of burning it,&#x201D; namely, after <italic>he washed the inwards and the legs in water</italic> [mentioned in the following verse]. It is with reference to this that He states, <italic>and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn578">207</xref></sup> for after the washing he burnt everything at the same time. Scripture, however, separated them [stating here in Verse 20 that he burnt the head and the pieces, etc., and afterwards in Verse 21 that he washed the inwards and the legs], so as to teach us that the pieces do not need washing.</p>
<p>22. AND HE PRESENTED THE OTHER RAM, THE RAM OF &#x2018;HAMILU&#x2019;IM&#x2019; (CONSECRATION). I have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn579">208</xref></sup> that the meaning of &#x201C;consecration&#x201D; is that the priests should be fully empowered to perform the Divine Service, and that this term is applied to both the altar itself and to those who perform the Service. Thus all these offerings [the bullock of the sin-offering, the ram of the burnt-offering, etc.,] were brought for the purpose of consecrating the priests, as it is written, <italic>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto Me in the priest&#x2019;s office: take one young bullock and two rams without blemish</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn580">209</xref></sup> The second ram, however, is here called specifically <italic>the ram of consecration</italic>, because it was the last of these offerings, and it was after it that their consecration was completed and they ministered before Him, blessed be He, for all these offerings were indispensable in the matter.</p>
<p>It is possible that the [purpose of the] sin-offering was to effect atonement for the altar and to sanctify it, for it is so written;<sup><xref rid="fn581">210</xref></sup> and that the burnt-offering was to expiate for the priests, like the atonement effected by all freewill burnt-offerings,<sup><xref rid="fn582">211</xref></sup> and the second ram which was the peace-offering, was a thanksgiving to G-d for having given them in His house and within His walls a monument and a memorial.<sup><xref rid="fn583">212</xref></sup> Thus it was only the peace-offering which was brought for the purpose of consecration, and therefore it alone is here called &#x201C;the ram of <italic>milu&#x2019;im</italic>&#x201D; (consecration). It is called <italic>milu&#x2019;im</italic> [in the plural, although the offering for that purpose was, according to this interpretation, only one], because the fats and the thigh as well as the heave-offering of the bread were all burnt.<sup><xref rid="fn584">213</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. AND MOSES TOOK OF THE ANOINTING OIL, AND OF THE BLOOD WHICH WAS UPON THE ALTAR [AND SPRINKLED IT UPON AARON etc.]. I do not know whether he mixed [the oil with the blood] for these sprinklings, something like that which it says, <italic>and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn585">214</xref></sup> Nor has it become clear to me why Moses performed these sprinklings after the burning of the ram of consecration, for in the section containing the command about the consecration Services He mentioned first the sprinklings,<sup><xref rid="fn586">215</xref></sup> and only afterwards He said, <italic>And thou shalt take of the ram the fat, and the fat tail</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn587">216</xref></sup> Perhaps since He said there [in the same verse where He mentioned these sprinklings], <italic>and he</italic> [Aaron] <italic>and his garments shall be hallowed, and his sons and his sons&#x2019; garments with him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn586">215</xref></sup> Moses deduced that these sprinklings were the last things to be done to them, through which they would become completely holy, for in connection with anointing the priests He did not mention the term &#x201C;hallowed,&#x201D; nor in connection with the placing of the blood upon their thumbs.<sup><xref rid="fn588">217</xref></sup> [Therefore, since it is only stated in connection with the sprinklings of the oil and the blood that the priests are to become hallowed, Moses deduced that this was to be done <italic>after</italic> the burning of the ram of consecration.] And when it says here [immediately following Moses&#x2019; pouring the anointing oil upon Aaron&#x2019;s head], <italic>and he anointed him, to sanctify him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn589">218</xref></sup> it was not a complete sanctification until Moses had done the sprinklings, even as it says [in the verse before us, after he had done the sprinklings], <italic>and he sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons</italic>. Thus he completed the sanctification of the father and sons together by means of these sprinklings. The Rabbis have also said so in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn590">219</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And he sanctified Aaron</italic>. From here you learn that the sanctification of Aaron and his sons was completed only with the sprinkling of the blood.&#x201D;</p>
<p>32. AND THAT WHICH REMAINETH &#x2018;BABASAR UBALACHEM.&#x2019; The letter <italic>beth</italic> in these two words [which means literally: &#x201C; &#x2018;in&#x2019; the meat and &#x2018;in&#x2019; the bread&#x201D;] serves here as a <italic>mem</italic> the meaning thus being: &#x201C;and that which remains &#x2018;of&#x2019; the meat and &#x2018;of&#x2019; the bread. &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn591">220</xref></sup> Similarly: &#x2018;<italic>bayom ha&#x2019;shemini</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>&#x2018;on&#x2019; the eighth day</italic>), <italic>and forward</italic><sup><xref rid="fn592">221</xref></sup> [means <italic>miyom ha&#x2019;shemini</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;from&#x201D; the eighth day on]; <italic>and they oppressed and crushed the children of Israel &#x2018;bashanah hahi</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;in&#x2019; that year</italic>) <italic>eighteen years</italic><sup><xref rid="fn593">222</xref></sup> [means <italic>mishanah hahi</italic> &#x2014; <italic>from&#x2019; that year</italic>].</p>
<p>Scripture does not state: and that which remained &#x201C;till the morning,&#x201D; for they had already learned the law of the offerings and knew that these peace-offerings were to be regarded like the stricter offerings which are eaten for a day and a night,<sup><xref rid="fn594">223</xref></sup> [since they were accompanied by breads like a thanks-offering]. Or it may be that Scripture speaks briefly here because it is explained in the section containing the command of these offerings, <italic>And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain unto the morning</italic>, [<italic>then thou shalt burn the remainder</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn595">224</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. AND AT THE DOOR OF THE TENT OF MEETING SHALL YE ABIDE DAY AND NIGHT SEVEN DAYS, AND KEEP THE CHARGE OF THE ETERNAL, THAT YE DIE NOT. In the opinion of the Beraitha of Torath Kohanim,<sup><xref rid="fn596">225</xref></sup> the meaning of this verse is that <italic>they shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</italic><sup><xref rid="fn597">226</xref></sup> day and night at the time of the service, that is to say, until they finish all the work incumbent upon them at that time. This is a commandment which applies for all generations, that a priest may not leave the Sanctuary while he is ministering the Service,<sup><xref rid="fn598">227</xref></sup> and he is liable to death [by the hand of Heaven, for the transgression thereof]. It is with reference to this that He said about the High Priest, <italic>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane</italic> [<italic>the Sanctuary of G-d</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn599">228</xref></sup> The Rabbis have said about this:<sup><xref rid="fn596">225</xref></sup> &#x201C;When is he not permitted to go out of the Sanctuary [and must stay there in order] not to profane it? One must say that this applies only when he is ministering.&#x201D; And they have further interpreted:<sup><xref rid="fn596">225</xref></sup> &#x201C;[<italic>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</italic>,] <italic>lest ye die</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn600">229</xref></sup> From the negative you infer the positive [that if they do go out whilst ministering, they are liable to death by the hand of Heaven]. I would only know that Aaron and his sons, who were anointed with the oil of anointment, are liable to death [by the hand of Heaven] if they leave the Sanctuary while they are ministering. How do I know that the prohibition applies also to all priests at all times? Scripture therefore says, <italic>for the anointing oil of the Eternal is upon you</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn600">229</xref></sup> The meaning of that is as follows: since He did not say: &#x201C;for you are anointed with the anointing oil of the Eternal,&#x201D; but instead He said &#x201C;upon you,&#x201D; it is like the verse, <italic>and their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn601">230</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. AND AARON AND HIS SONS DID ALL THE THINGS WHICH THE ETERNAL COMMANDED BY THE HAND OF MOSES. Everywhere in this section it says <italic>&#x2018;as&#x2019; the Eternal commanded Moses</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn602">231</xref></sup> but here, since Aaron&#x2019;s sons added to the command [by bringing <italic>strange fire which He had not commanded them</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn603">232</xref></sup> He does not say it in this way, since they did not do as the Eternal commanded Moses. Rather, the verse states that they did all the things <italic>&#x2018;which&#x2019; the Eternal commanded</italic>, and they further added to them &#x201C;the strange fire&#x201D; of which He said that <italic>He had not commanded them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn603">232</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn372">(1) Above, 1:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn373">(2) Thus the question arises: Why are these two sections addressed differently?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn374">(3) Since Rashi understood Rabbi Shimon&#x2019;s statement as referring to the burnt-offering, it must be understood as follows: In the case of all other offerings, the priest eats part of the meat and thus derives some personal benefit, therefore he does not have to be urged on to perform their rites. In the case of the burnt-offering, however, he derives no benefit, since it is completely burnt on the altar; hence Scripture [speaking here of <italic>the law of the burnt-offering</italic>], preceded it by the expression, <italic>&#x2018;command&#x2019; Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the law of the burnt-offering</italic>, in order to urge them on to fulfill the commandment. &#x2014; Ramban, however, argues that even from the burnt-offering the priests do derive a personal benefit, namely, the hide (further, 7:8). Accordingly he will interpret Rabbi Shimon&#x2019;s statement as referring to another matter, as he explains further on.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn375">(4) The meat of the sin-offering and the guilt-offering is eaten completely by the priests. They are also given a share of the peace-offering (further, 7:34). The residue of the meal-offering after the handful was burnt on the altar, was eaten by the priests (<italic>ibid.</italic>, Verse 9).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn376">(5) This is a reference to the hide of the animal which belongs to the priest (further, 7:8). &#x2014; Rashi, however, considered this share of little value and hence he understood Rabbi Shimon&#x2019;s statement as applying to the burnt-offering, and that this was why the expression &#x201C;command &#x2026; &#x201D; is mentioned here, namely, because the priests incur a monetary loss, and hence they had to be urged on to fulfill the command. &#x2014; Thus according to Rashi, Rabbi Shimon differs with the First Sage, (<italic>Tanna Kamma</italic>) [when a Mishnah or a Beraitha cites a number of different authorities, and the first authority is mentioned annonymously, that opinion generally is referred to that of the <italic>Tanna Kamma</italic>] who said that the expression &#x201C;command &#x2026; &#x201D; is mentioned here because it is a commandment binding at once and also for future generations, while Rabbi Shimon holds that this is not the reason for its use; instead, the reason for the expression &#x201C;command &#x2026; &#x201D; is because in attending to the burnt-offering the priests suffer a monetary loss, and hence they have to be urged on. Ramban, however, argues that even in the case of burnt-offerings the priests incur no monetary loss, since they keep the hides, hence Rabbi Shimon also agrees with the First Sage that the reason for the use of the expression &#x201C;command &#x2026; &#x201D; in this context is because it is a command binding at once and for future generations. Ramban then continues by saying that Rabbi Shimon&#x2019;s statement has no bearing on our subject of the burnt-offering, but its meaning is as will be explained further on.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn377">(6) I.e., in other places. But here [in the case of the burnt-offering] Rabbi Shimon agrees with the reason stated by the First Sage. See Note 5 above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn378">(7) Further, 24:2: <italic>Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light</italic> &#x2026;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn379">(8) Numbers 35:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn380">(9) Further, Verse 13. This is interpreted by the Sages to mean that the High Priest is to bring a meal-offering every day, half of it in the morning and half thereof in the evening. The ordinary priest brought such a meal-offering at his installation into the priestly office, and it was known as the &#x201C;meal-offering of initiation.&#x201D; Since the money for these meal-offerings does not come from the public treasury but from the priests themselves, there is thus a monetary loss incurred by them, and hence the expression &#x201C;Command Aaron and his sons &#x2026; &#x201D; with which this section opens. If this is so, Rabbi Shimon&#x2019;s statement does refer to this section and Rashi was therefore correct in citing his words here &#x2014; as being <italic>an additional reason</italic> to that of the First Sage as to why the expression &#x201C;command &#x2026; &#x201D; is mentioned here. However, etc. (see text).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn381">(10) &#x201C;Sifre.&#x201D; This is the version found in all texts of Ramban &#x2014; but it should be &#x201C;Sifra,&#x201D; as it is found here in Torath Kohanim at the beginning of the <italic>Seder</italic>. See in <italic>Seder Vayikra</italic> Note 121.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn382">(11) Ramban&#x2019;s intent is as follows: When in a Tannaitic text the opinion of a second Sage is mentioned in the words: &#x201C;Rabbi &#x2026; says,&#x201D; it indicates that he differs with the opinion of the First Sage. Where, however, it states: &#x201C;Said Rabbi &#x2026; &#x201D; it usually means that he agrees with the former opinion, but he makes an additional point to strengthen it further. Here, however, [in the text of the Sifra before Ramban] it states: &#x201C;Rabbi Shimon says,&#x201D; and hence indicates that he <italic>differs</italic> with the opinion of the First Sage. [It must be noted though that the Sifra text that <italic>we</italic> have has: &#x201C;Said Rabbi Shimon,&#x201D; which vindicates that there is no difference of opinion between the two Sages. Ramban&#x2019;s Sifra text perforce must have had the reading: &#x201C;Rabbi Shimon says &#x2026; &#x201D; A similar reading is found in the Sifre <italic>Naso</italic> 1: &#x201C;Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai says &#x2026; &#x201D;]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn383">(12) In our Rashi text: <italic>torah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn384">(13) See Numbers 15:3-12 for the command that burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings had to be accompanied by an offering of wine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn385">(14) Succah 48a. There were two such bowls there, one for the wine-libation and the other for the special water-libation on the Festival of Succoth (see in <italic>Seder Vayikra</italic> Note 219). &#x201C;The bowl to the west was for water and that to the east was for wine&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>, 48 b).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn386">(15) Zebachim 83 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn387">(16) For just as the term <italic>torah</italic> (law) denotes inclusion (one law for all things), so does the word <italic>hi</italic> (&#x201C;she&#x201D; or &#x201C;it&#x201D;) denote exclusion, implying that the law under consideration does not apply to everything but is limited in its scope. It is the Sages who in their interpretation of the law determine in which cases it applies and in which it does not.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn388">(17) Exodus 23:18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn389">(18) Mechilta <italic>ibid</italic>. See also Ramban there.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn390">(19) See Zebachim 84a for full discussion of these cases.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn391">(20) Further, Verse 6. Ramban thus explains the impersonal language [&#x201C;shall be kept burning&#x201D;] as a command addressed to the priests.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn392">(21) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn393">(22) See further, Note 25 where Ramban differs with Rashi in interpreting the expression &#x2018;<italic>lo thichbeh</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>it shall not go out</italic>) which appears both in Verse 5 and Verse 6. Consequently Ramban writes here &#x201C;in my opinion,&#x201D; alluding to the fact that this is not in consonance with Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn394">(23) Yoma 22 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn395">(24) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Tzav</italic> 2:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn396">(25) Ramban&#x2019;s intent is to allude to Rashi who wrote [in Verse 6]: &#x201C;One who extinguishes the fire on the altar transgresses <italic>two</italic> negative commandments&#x201D; [i.e., &#x2018;<italic>lo thichbeh</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>it shall not go out</italic>) mentioned in Verse 5 and again in Verse 6]. According to Ramban, however, as explained above, the second <italic>lo thichbeh</italic> is a special prohibition to the priests who look after the altar not to be careless in permitting the fire to be extinguished. Hence there is only one verse [5] referring to <italic>any</italic> person who extinguishes the fire on the altar. Hence Ramban&#x2019;s expression, &#x201C;It appears to me that he violates only one negative commandment.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn397">(26) The ordinary priest ministered in four garments: the tunic, breeches, turban, and the belt. To these the High Priest added four more pieces of raiment: the breastplate, the ephod, the robe and the frontlet. &#x2014; The question then appears: since removing the ashes from the altar had to be done by a priest, why does Scripture here single out only two of the garments, the tunic and the breeches? &#x2014; The taking up of the ashes was the very first act in the day&#x2019;s Service in the Sanctuary. See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, pp. 38-39.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn398">(27) Yoma 22 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn399">(28) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Tzav</italic> 2:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn400">(29) I Samuel 4:12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn401">(30) Psalms 133:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn402">(31) II Samuel 20:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn403">(32) Rabbi Dosa (Yoma 12 b). See Ramban in <italic>Seder Pekudei</italic> (Exodus 39:28, Vol. II, p. 614).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn404">(33) The belt of the High Priest was made of blue, purple, scarlet [all wool] and twined linen. This is expressly stated in the Torah. The question appears as to how the belt for the common priests was made. Rabbi Dosa is of the opinion that it was made only of linen; Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi differs, holding that it was like that of the High Priest. Now since Onkelos, as explained by Ramban, explains the word <italic>mido</italic> as an inclusive term for &#x201C;all&#x201D; the priest&#x2019;s garments, and the verse states, <italic>and the priest shall put on &#x2018;mido&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>his &#x2018;garments&#x2019; of</italic>) <italic>linen</italic>, Onkelos accordingly must agree with Rabbi Dosa that the belt of the common priest was unlike that of the High Priest, as the belt of the common priest was only of linen. Hence it states that the common priest shall put on <italic>all</italic> his garments of linen which includes the belt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn405">(34) The subject-matter of this verse [4] should be clearly distinguished from that of the preceding verse. In Verse 3 the Torah commanded the priests to remove the ashes daily from the altar. This involved the priest&#x2019;s taking a silver pan and going up to the top of the altar, and afterwards &#x201C;he cleared away the cinders on either side and he scooped up the ashes in the center. He then descended, and when he reached the pavement he turned his face to the north and went along the east side of the ascent for about ten cubits, and then made a heap of the cinders on the pavement three handbreadths away from the ascent&#x201D; (Tamid 28 b). This process of course did not remove <italic>all</italic> the ashes from upon the altar. This was done from time to time when there was a need for it, when so much accumulated that there was no more room on the woodpile. Then it was removed to a place outside the camp or Jerusalem. It is this latter subject which is the theme of the present verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn406">(35) Yoma 23 b. See my Hebrew commentary p. 29, that the Sage holding this opinion is Rabbi Eliezer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn407">(36) Further, 16:32.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn408">(37) Verse 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn409">(38) Verse 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn410">(39) &#x201C;So that it becomes exactly like the meal-offering &#x2014; that if it had become disqualified to be eaten, the food which touched it is also disqualified. And if the meal-offering was fit to be eaten, the other food must also be eaten under the same stringency as the meal-offering&#x201D; (Rashi, Verse 11).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn411">(40) If a meal-offering is brought by a non-priest, a handful of it is taken off by a priest and burnt on the altar, while the residue is eaten by the priests. Now the Torah specifies, however, that if the meal-offering is brought by a priest, it is to be <italic>wholly</italic> burnt (further, Verse 16). The question appears: is it necessary that a handful thereof be taken by a priest and be burnt separately on the altar, or that the whole meal-offering should be burnt at the same time as a unit? According to the text in Ramban before us, the answer is clearly in the affirmative. Scholars, however, have pointed to the Talmud (in Menachoth 72 b) where the conclusion is contrary to this text. The suggestion has therefore been made that the text here is faulty, and should be emended to read: &#x201C;that even a meal-offering of priests requires &#x2018;oil and frankincense&#x2019; &#x201D; (mentioned in Verse 8). See my Hebrew commentary, p. 29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn412">(41) In Verse 7 before us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn413">(42) Verse 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn414">(43) Verse 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn415">(44) The verse thus says that the reason, why the priests are not permitted even to apportion the residue of the meal-offering amongst themselves until the altar&#x2019;s share has gone up as a fire offering, is because the meal-offering is most holy, therefore it follows that the same principle applies to all offerings, since they are all holy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn416">(45) The Hebrew text reads: <italic>lo thei&#x2019;apheh chametz chelkam</italic> &#x2026; The juxtaposition of the word <italic>chelkam</italic> (their portion) to the word <italic>chametz</italic> (leavened) is the reason for the Rabbis&#x2019; interpretation that the portion the priests receive from the meal-offering, neither may be baked with leaven.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn417">(46) One who is required to bring a sin-offering because of a transgression committed, cannot use sacred money [such as money of the Second Tithe, and the like]; but he must take some of his ordinary money and buy the offering with it. This principle is derived from the verse, <italic>And Aaron shall offer the bull of the sin-offering &#x2018;which is his&#x2019;</italic> (further, 16:6), that is, from the money which belongs to him. Sacred money, on the other hand, is not completely his to dispose of as he wishes.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn420">(49) The meal-offerings which accompanied the Daily and Additional Offerings brought in the name of all Israel, were wholly burnt on the altar (Menachoth 73 b). Hence Rambam speaks of the <italic>minchath yachid</italic> (the meal-offering of the individual).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn421">(50) &#x201C;<italic>V&#x2019;yidmeh</italic> (and he will imagine).&#x201D; Such is the text in Al Charizi&#x2019;s translation of the Moreh Nebuchim, which Ramban follows. The intent would seem to be that the priest who is offering his own meal-offering will imagine that he has performed no Divine Service, and therefore he might violate the laws regarding the eating of the residue. Hence the Torah prohibited him from eating it. In Ibn Tibbon&#x2019;s translation, however, the reading is: &#x201C;<italic>V&#x2019;lo yeira&#x2019;eh</italic> (and it will not appear),&#x201D; that is, to others, that a Service has been performed, and therefore they will hold the priest in disregard for eating it. That is why the Torah commanded that it be wholly burnt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn422">(51) See Note 16 above, that the term <italic>torah</italic> or <italic>torath</italic> (&#x201C;law&#x201D; or &#x201C;law of&#x201D;) at the beginning of a section, denotes inclusion, while <italic>hi</italic> denotes exclusion. So also the word <italic>zoth</italic> (this), as it says here in this case, <italic>zoth torath</italic> &#x2026; (<italic>this is the law of</italic> &#x2026;), means exclusion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn423">(52) Sin-offerings were of two kinds: (a) those whose blood was sprinkled on the outer altar, and are therefore referred to as the &#x201C;outer sin-offerings.&#x201D; These included most of the sin-offerings. After the sprinkling of the blood and the burning of the fats, the meat was eaten by the priests, (b) The second group was called &#x201C;the inner sin offerings,&#x201D; because their blood was taken into the interior of the Sanctuary to be sprinkled in front of the Veil overhanging the Holy of Holies, as well as on the golden altar (see above, 4:6-7; 17-18), and on the Day of Atonement also in front of the ark (further, 16:14-15). These sin-offerings were wholly burnt outside the camp [and later, after the Sanctuary was built, they were burnt outside the city of Jerusalem]. &#x2014; Now here in Verse 20 Scripture states the law regarding &#x201C;the <italic>outer</italic> sin-offerings,&#x201D; that if any of their blood was sprinkled upon a garment, the garment must be washed in a holy place [i.e., in the Court of the Sanctuary], But it does not say this law with regard to &#x201C;the inner sin-offerings.&#x201D; Since the section, however, begins with the expression [<italic>zoth</italic>] <italic>&#x2018;torath&#x2019; hachatath</italic> (<italic>this is &#x2018;the law&#x2019; of the sin-offering</italic>), and the word <italic>torath</italic> denotes inclusion, we know that the same law applies to both kinds of sin-offering.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn426">(55) Peace-offerings could be brought <italic>only by an individual</italic>, and they were considered of a lesser degree of holiness. Only once a year, namely, on the Festival of Shevuoth, were peace-offerings brought by the public (see further, 23:19). These were considered among &#x201C;the most holy offerings.&#x201D; Offerings which were most holy were slaughtered on the north side of the altar, and could be eaten only by male priests, within the Court of the Sanctuary, during the same day and night; those that were holy to a lesser degree were slaughtered in any part of the Court, and could be eaten by any person, within the enclosed city of Jerusalem, for two days and the intervening night. The thanks-offering and the Nazirite&#x2019;s ram, though holy to a lesser degree, could be eaten only the same day and the ensuing night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn427">(56) Further, 7:12. The thanks-offering is a form of peace-offering, and is therefore holy to a lesser degree.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn428">(57) Numbers 6:14. The ram of the Nazirite is a peace-offering (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn432">(61) The Court of the Tabernacle was enclosed by curtains (see Exodus 27:9-16). In the Sanctuary at Jerusalem it was surrounded by a wall. The sense of the expression is thus identical in both cases, namely, the Temple Court.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn438">(67) Numbers 15:24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn439">(68) Thus far we have followed the interpretation of Rashi which is based upon sources in the Talmud, which was as follows: &#x201C;<italic>and every</italic> outer <italic>sin-offering whereof any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to atone in the holy place</italic>, according to the priest&#x2019;s intent which was not, however, in accordance with the law &#x2014; since the blood of an outer sin-offering is to be sprinkled upon the outer altar &#x2014; that offering <italic>shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire</italic>.&#x201D; Ramban is now to suggest a totally different interpretation, namely, that the verse is not speaking of <italic>outer</italic> sin-offerings wrongly brought in, but establishes the principle that all &#x201C;<italic>inner</italic> sin-offerings&#x201D; [as enumerated in the text: &#x201C;the bullock of the anointed priest etc.&#x201D;] the blood of which <italic>is</italic> regularly brought into the interior, are not to be eaten by the priests, unlike that of &#x201C;the outer sin-offerings,&#x201D; whose meat is eaten by the priests (see Note 52 above). Ramban will conclude by saying that this is the interpretation of one of the Sages in the Torath Kohanim and Talmud.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn440">(69) Above, 4:12, 21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn441">(70) The command in Chapter 4 is a positive one; Ramban is saying that the verse here adds to this a negative command, not to eat of the flesh, in addition to the positive one to burn it. There is thus an additional penalty for one who eats of it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn442">(71) Ramban means to say that although Verses 17-22 clearly speak of <italic>outer</italic> sin-offerings [which are eaten], Scripture wished to complete here all laws pertaining to all sin-offerings, and thus we may interpret Verse 23 as indeed referring to <italic>inner</italic> sin-offerings (see note 68 above).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn443">(72) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Tzav</italic> 8:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn444">(73) Zebachim 82 a.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn449">(78) &#x201C;The bullocks which are burnt and the he-goats which are burnt [outside the camp], their skins are burnt with them, as it is said, <italic>and they shall burn in fire their skins, and their flesh</italic> (further, 16:27) (Torath Kohanim, <italic>Tzav</italic> 9:5). Hence the Torah had to explain that the burnt-offering is different; but in the case of the sin-offering and the guilt-offering, it was not necessary to mention that the skin belongs to the priest, for since he acquired the right to the meat, the skin naturally came with it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn450">(79) Above, 2:14-16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn451">(80) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 5:11-14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn452">(81) Numbers 5:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn453">(82) Verse 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn454">(83) The priests were divided into twenty-four groups. Each group came by turn to the Sanctuary for one week&#x2019;s service. These groups were in turn subdivided into Fathers&#x2019; Houses, each House ministering for one day out of the seven. On the festivals all the groups shared equally in the Service. See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, pp. 46-47.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn455">(84) Verse 8 &#x2014; stating that the skin of the burnt-offering belongs to the priest who offered it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn456">(85) Verse 7 &#x2014; stating that the meat of the sin-offering and guilt-offering belong to the priest that made the atonement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn457">(86) I Samuel 30:24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn458">(87) The point here is as follows. In the case of the three meal-offerings which are baked [i.e., the one baked in the oven, made in the boiling pot, and in the pan], even if the priest receives only a small part thereof, he can eat it readily. But in the case of the meal-offering of fine flour, if the share is small he will not be benefitted much by it. One might therefore think that he can receive his share from another kind of meal-offering, hence the law states that the apportionment must be only in that one kind.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn459">(88) In other words, even though the literal interpretation of the verses indicates that the three baked meal-offerings should all belong exclusively to the priest who was actively engaged in offering them, yet it is tradition which is the deciding factor that the Rabbis&#x2019; analysis of the verses, as explained above, is correct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn460">(89) This interpretation indicates clearly that <italic>all</italic> meal-offerings are mentioned alike in Scripture with respect to the share of all ministering priests on that day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn461">(90) So explained by Ibn Ezra.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn462">(91) Verse 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn463">(92) Flour comprising twenty tenths of an ephah (see Note 95) was divided equally for the baking of the unleavened and leavened breads. The unleavened breads were of three kinds [cakes, wafers, and cakes of flour saturated with oil &#x2014; as mentioned in Verse 12] each consisting of ten, thus making thirty unleavened breads. The leavened breads were ten. Thus while fewer in number, the leavened breads were yet larger, since the same amount of flour was used for the total amount of unleavened breads &#x2014; thirty &#x2014; as for the ten leavened breads. Of these four kinds of breads, one of each was given to the priest and the rest were eaten by the owner of the offering and his family.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn464">(93) Menachoth 77 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn465">(94) The Jerusalem measure was one sixth larger than that of the wilderness. Hence six seahs of Wilderness measure made five seahs of Jerusalem measure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn466">(95) An ephah is three seahs. Six seahs thus make two ephahs. Since in each ephah there are ten tenths [of the ephah], the two ephahs [comprising the six seahs] make twenty tenths of the ephah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn467">(96) There were three kinds of unleavened cake, each consisting of ten cakes, thus totaling thirty. Thus since thirty cakes were made out of the total of ten tenths of an ephah, it follows that three cakes were made out of each tenth.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn469">(98) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn470">(99) Further, 23:17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn471">(100) The Tur refutes this argument by pointing to the fact that nothing of &#x201C;the two loaves&#x201D; of the Festival of Shevuoth came up on the altar either; yet Scripture found it necessary to call attention to their being an exception to the prohibition against burning leaven on the altar, because of the offerings that came with the two loaves (see <italic>ibid.</italic>, Verse 18), and such is the case also with the thanks-offering. So the question recurs: Why did Scripture not call attention to the exception of the breads of the thanks-offering? The Tur answers that Scripture called attention only to an obligatory offering, such being the case of &#x201C;the two loaves&#x201D; on the Festival of Shevuoth, but not to a thanks-offering, which is a freewill offering. See further my Hebrew commentary pp. 33-34.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn472">(101) Twelve loaves were put on the golden table in the Sanctuary every Sabbath, with two spoons of frankincense beside them. On the following Sabbath the frankincense was burnt on the altar and the loaves were divided among the priests. None of the bread was offered on the altar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn473">(102) &#x201C; &#x2018;<italic>Kol</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>any</italic>) <italic>meal-offering, which ye shall bring unto the Eternal, shall not be made with leaven</italic> (above, 2:11), the word <italic>kol</italic> includes the showbread, that it too must not be leavened&#x201D; (Menachoth 57 a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn474">(103) Further, 24:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn475">(104) And not because of the leaven, as we have understood it till now.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn476">(105) I.e., the seven kinds of products for which the Land of Israel was famed: wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olive-oil, and [date] honey. See my translation of &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, pp. 133-134.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn478">(107) Further, 18:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn479">(108) Deuteronomy 25:5. See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, p. 217, that the duty of marrying the wife of a deceased brother who left no offspring comes before the duty of <italic>chalitzah</italic>. For various reasons the practice now established is to grant the widow <italic>chalitzah</italic>, and she is then free to marry.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn480">(109) Numbers 6:14. The Nazirite&#x2019;s ram was a peace-offering (<italic>ibid.</italic>) and a peace-offering may be eaten for two days and the one intervening night. Yet Scripture establishes here that the Nazirite&#x2019;s ram is an exception, and may be eaten as a thanks-offering which is only for a day and night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn481">(110) In order that the Passover-offering be eaten after one has satisfied one&#x2019;s hunger, a Festal-offering was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of Nisan which was eaten on the night of the fifteenth [i.e., the first night of Passover], before the Passover-offering was eaten. Now this Festal-offering was really a peace-offering, and hence it ought to be eaten for two days and the one intervening night. But according to Rashi it is here included in the law of the thanks-offering, to be eaten only for one day and a night. Ramban further on will differ with this opinion of Rashi, and hold that it has the usual law of peace-offerings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn482">(111) Pesachim 71 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn483">(112) Deuteronomy 16:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn484">(113) The explanation of the verse (Rashi <italic>ibid.</italic>) is thus as follows: &#x201C;<italic>Neither shall any of the flesh which thou offerest at even</italic> [i.e., towards eventide on the fourteenth of Nisan] <italic>remain on the first day</italic> [of the festival, i.e., the fifteenth day of Nisan] <italic>all night until the morning</italic> of the sixteenth,&#x201D; but it may be eaten only on the fourteenth and fifteenth days and the one intervening night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn485">(114) For since the expression &#x201C;on the first day&#x201D; means that it may be eaten the whole of the first day of the festival, the term <italic>laboker</italic> (<italic>until the morning</italic>) must perforce refer to the morning of the second day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn486">(115) Exodus 12:5. A peace-offering, on the other hand, can be brought of the cattle, male or female, regardless of the age (above, 3:1).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn487">(116) Exodus 34:25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn488">(117) Pesachim 70 a. Ben Teima thus interprets the verse to refer to two separate offerings, and derives the law that they are both to be eaten within the same time not from the amplification of Verse 15 before us, but from the explicit statement in Exodus 34:25: <italic>neither shall &#x2026; be left unto the morning</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn492">(121) Pesachim 96 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn493">(122) The term &#x201C;remain over from the Passover-offering&#x201D; includes besides the two cases mentioned in the text also the case if he set aside a certain sum of money for the buying of a Passover-offering, and not all the money was used up for that purpose, he must bring a peace-offering from the balance (Pesachim 70 b; Mishneh Torah <italic>Hilchoth Korban Pesach</italic> 4:10).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn494">(123) The Hebrew reads: &#x201C;<italic>shenithkapru</italic> (that they were forgiven)&#x201D; &#x2014; a term borrowed from a sin-offering. But in the case of the Passover-offering the sense is that the owners had fulfilled their duty through another offering.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn498">(127) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Tzav</italic> 12:11-12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn499">(128) The <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>v&#x2019;kodesh</italic> thus stands for the repetition of the phrase <italic>ad mathai</italic> (how long), and is therefore not redundant.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn508">(137) Deuteronomy 12:14. A reference to the Sanctuary in Shiloh and to its final location in Jerusalem.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn509">(138) The allusion is to Ibn Ezra who in Verse 20 wrote that the phrase <italic>in all your dwellings</italic> refers also to the offerings (see the verse mentioned in the text with reference to the new produce, and also the following note).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn510">(139) Further, 23:14. On the basis of this verse Ibn Ezra argued that <italic>in all your dwellings</italic> applies also to the offerings, since the verse refers to the <italic>omer</italic> (a measure of new barley brought as a meal-offering on the second day of Passover). But Ramban answers that the phrase refers not to the <italic>omer</italic>, but to the new crop which, through the offering of the <italic>omer</italic>, was henceforth permitted to be eaten (see &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. II, pp. 186-188). It is to this prohibition of eating of the new crop before the bringing of the <italic>omer</italic> [or before the end of the sixteenth day of Nisan], that the phrase <italic>in all your dwellings</italic> refers. Hence the phrase <italic>in all your dwellings</italic> which is stated in connection with the prohibitions against eating fat and blood (above, 3:17) must perforce mean that they are applicable everywhere, independent of the existence of the Sanctuary and its offerings.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn516">(145) See Ramban above, 3:9. Ramban is here arguing that if the prohibition against eating fats is restricted to those offered on the altar, why do we find no prohibition in connection with the other parts offered on the altar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn517">(146) Deuteronomy 15:23. Ramban&#x2019;s explanation of this subject is found there in 12:22.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn519">(148) Menachoth 61 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn520">(149) In Verse 30 before us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn521">(150) As the verse reads, it might appear that G-d only commanded that the priests be given these gifts of the peace-offerings, on the day they were anointed as priests, but not throughout the generations. Therefore Ramban explains the purport of the verse to be as explained in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn522">(151) Verse 35.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn523">(152) The letter <italic>beth</italic> in the word <italic>b&#x2019;yom</italic> (in the day) thus serves as a <italic>mem</italic> (<italic>mi&#x2019;yom</italic> &#x2014; from the day). Ibn Ezra thus solves the difficulty in the verse (see Note 150) by interpreting it as a command for the future.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn526">(155) The verse reads: <italic>Which the Eternal commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to present their offerings unto the Eternal, in the wilderness of Sinai</italic>. Now according to the interpretation of the Rabbis mentioned above, the sense of the verse is that the laws of the offerings were commanded to Moses &#x201C;in Mount Sinai,&#x201D; and were repeated to him in the Tent of Meeting &#x201C;in the wilderness of Sinai.&#x201D; Ramban will now explain that according to the plain meaning of Scripture this verse speaks of two separate occasions: the offerings of the seven-day consecration of the priests were commanded to Moses &#x201C;in Mount Sinai,&#x201D; whilst the laws of the other offerings were given to Moses &#x201C;in the wilderness of Sinai,&#x201D; that is, in the Tabernacle.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn538">(167) During each of the seven days of consecration Moses set the Tabernacle up and then dismantled it. But on the eighth day [which was the first of Nisan] the final erection took place, and it was no longer dismantled until they journeyed from Mount Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn539">(168) Since the final erection of the Tabernacle is already mentioned at the end of the Book of Exodus (40:17), and the section before us, according to Rashi, was said seven days <italic>before</italic> the final erection, we must perforce say that there is no strict chronological order in the narrative of the Torah. In other words, chronologically the proper place of this section here in the Book of Leviticus is before Exodus, Chapter 40&#x0021; Ramban will strongly dissent to this interpretation of Rashi.</ftnote>

Hence Ramban preceded this discussion with the expression, &#x201C;by way of the proper interpretation &#x2026; &#x201D; in order to indicate that his view is different than that stated elsewhere in Rashi&#x2019;s commentary.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Shemini</title>
<h1>9</h1>
<p>2. AND HE [Moses] SAID TO AARON: TAKE THEE A BULL-CALF FOR A SIN-OFFERING. Moses, our teacher, had been commanded about these offerings, as he said at the end [of the section], <italic>This is the thing which the Eternal commanded that ye should do</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn604">1</xref></sup> although this [command for these specific offerings] is not expressly mentioned. Similarly, <italic>And Moses said: This is the thing which the Eternal hath commanded: Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn605">2</xref></sup> [where the verse indicates that Moses received a Divine command although it is not specifically mentioned]. Also, <italic>I am the G-d of Beth-el</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn606">3</xref></sup> when Jacob related [to his wives all that G-d&#x2019;s angel had told him in the dream], even though it is not mentioned in Scripture that he was so told. I have already shown to you<sup><xref rid="fn607">4</xref></sup> many such examples in the sections on the commandments regarding the Passover.</p>
<p><italic>And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak</italic>. This means that Aaron is to speak to them thus, as it was His wish that Aaron should be the one who commands in the name of G-d, and that he should be the one who would bring the offerings, in order to elevate him in the eyes of the people. The correct interpretation is that the expression <italic>and unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak</italic>, means you [Aaron] and the elders mentioned [in Verse 1], since it was for that purpose that he called them,<sup><xref rid="fn608">5</xref></sup> so that they should speak to the children of Israel, as in the verse, <italic>And Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them: Draw out</italic> [<italic>and take you lambs</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn609">6</xref></sup> Or it may be that [Moses] said to each of the elders, <italic>and unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak</italic> [the singular word <italic>thou</italic> thus referring to each one of the elders]. Accordingly, the meaning of the section is as follows: <italic>and he</italic> [Moses] <italic>said to Aaron: Take thee</italic> etc., and to [each of] the elders he said, <italic>and unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak</italic>. For one who speaks to many people usually addresses his command to each person individually, something like that which it is said, <italic>And I commanded you at that time, saying</italic> etc.: <italic>Ye shall pass over armed before your brethren</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn610">7</xref></sup> There are many such cases in the Book of Deuteronomy [where Moses speaks to the whole congregation, when his message is actually addressed to each person individually].</p>
<p>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that the verse, <italic>And Moses said: This is the thing which the Eternal commanded that ye should do</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn604">1</xref></sup> means that &#x201C;Moses had already told them, <italic>this is the thing</italic>.&#x201D; If so, it is possible that the meaning of the verses be as follows: Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel, <italic>and Moses said: This thing which the Eternal has commanded</italic> me <italic>ye should do, that the Glory of the Eternal may appear unto you;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn604">1</xref></sup> <italic>and he said unto Aaron: Take thee a bull-calf</italic> etc.; <italic>and unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying: Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn611">8</xref></sup> Thus [Moses] spoke briefly at first [as in Verse 6] and then explained himself at the end [in Verses 2-4].</p>
<p>But this is not correct. Rather, after Moses had mentioned to them the offerings [which they were required to bring on that day], <italic>and they brought that which Moses commanded</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn612">9</xref></sup> he said to them again, <italic>This is the thing which the Eternal commanded that ye should do</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn604">1</xref></sup> meaning that they should bring the offerings in the order that he would command them, and afterwards the Glory of the Eternal would appear to them. Now since he had said, <italic>for today the Eternal appeareth unto you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn613">10</xref></sup> he went back and said that He would appear to them through His Glory.</p>
<p>Now these offerings [which were brought on the eighth day after the completion of the seven-day consecration of the priests], were not mentioned in the section of <italic>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto Me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn614">11</xref></sup> for there He only gave the command about the consecration, and their days of consecration were completed with the seven days and their offerings, but now on the eighth day, they themselves brought the offerings [whereas on the seven days of the consecration, the offerings were brought by Moses]. Thus these offerings [brought on the eighth day] were a kind of initiation for the priests, as was the meal-offering of the baken cakes<sup><xref rid="fn615">12</xref></sup> command for future generations [which were brought] <italic>on the day when he is anointed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn616">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that it was in order to atone for the incident of the golden calf that He now gave them these added offerings, for at the time when He commanded the section of <italic>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto Me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn614">11</xref></sup> the golden calf had not yet been made, as I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn617">14</xref></sup> and therefore He did not mention them [these offerings] there. It is thus not as Rashi wrote there,<sup><xref rid="fn614">11</xref></sup> that the bullock [offered on each of the seven days of consecration] was to atone for the incident of the golden calf, but these bullocks were to purify the altar,<sup><xref rid="fn618">15</xref></sup> and for Aaron and his sons in order <italic>to hallow them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn614">11</xref></sup> and it was this calf [brought] on the eighth day that was to atone for the incident of the golden calf. Thus Aaron&#x2019;s offerings [on this eight day] were the same as his offerings on the Day of Atonement,<sup><xref rid="fn619">16</xref></sup> [namely, the bull-calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, as mentioned in the verse before us], and the people&#x2019;s sin-offering [on this eighth day] was the same as their sin-offering on the Day of Atonement, namely, one <italic>he-goat for a sin-offering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn620">17</xref></sup> So also have the Rabbis said in the Tosephta of the section of consecration, in the Torath Kohanim,<sup><xref rid="fn621">18</xref></sup> that this calf [brought on the eighth day] was to atone for the incident of the golden calf. Thus they interpreted: &#x201C;For what reason did Israel bring more offerings [on this day] than Aaron?<sup><xref rid="fn622">19</xref></sup> It was on account of what He said to them: &#x2018;You [the people] have in your hands [sin] at the beginning, and you have in your hands [sin] at the end.&#x2019; You have sinned at the beginning, as it is written [when the brothers sold Joseph], <italic>and they killed a he-goat</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn623">20</xref></sup> and you have sinned at the end, as it is said, <italic>they have made them a molten calf</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn624">21</xref></sup> Therefore let them bring the he-goat [for a sin-offering] to atone for the incident connected with that of the he-goat, and let them bring a calf [as a burnt-offering] to atone for the incident of the golden calf.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It would appear that because the reason for Aaron&#x2019;s sin-offering [on this eighth day] was the same as that of his sin-offering on the Day of Atonement, therefore he burnt it [outside the camp]<sup><xref rid="fn625">22</xref></sup> as the one of the Day of Atonement is burnt,<sup><xref rid="fn626">23</xref></sup> even though this sin-offering [of the eighth day] was &#x201C;an outer sin-offering&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn627">24</xref></sup> [while that of the Day of Atonement was &#x201C;an inner sin-offering&#x201D;], for Moses did not explain that he should do so. But perhaps Aaron was indeed so commanded, and [it is not mentioned because] Scripture did not want to prolong the matter, it being known that Aaron would only do what Moses said, and that Moses would only say what G-d had commanded.</p>
<p>7. DRAW NEAR UNTO THE ALTAR. 8. AND AARON DREW NEAR UNTO THE ALTAR AND SLEW THE CALF. It seems to me in accordance with the plain meaning of Scripture that Moses said to Aaron: &#x201C;Draw near to the north side of the altar and offer there the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, for they are to be slaughtered on the north side of the altar.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn628">25</xref></sup> Moses, however, said it briefly since Aaron already knew [that these offerings were to be slaughtered on the north side of the altar].</p>
<p>Our Rabbis in the Torath Kohanim were, however, prompted by [the use of] these expressions to draw a parable [and to say]:<sup><xref rid="fn629">26</xref></sup> &#x201C;To what can this be compared? To a human king who married a woman, who in her shyness [did not dare to enter] before him. Her sister then approached her, saying, &#x2018;My sister, why did you enter this matter? Was it not in order that you serve the king? Embolden yourself and go in to serve the king&#x0021;&#x2019; Similarly did Moses say to Aaron: &#x2018;My brother&#x0021; Why were you chosen to be the High Priest? Was it not so that you minister before G-d? Embolden yourself and come and do your priestly activities.&#x2019; Some Rabbis say that Aaron saw the [horned] altar in <italic>the form of the bull</italic> [which &#x2014; as stated in Psalms 106: 20 &#x2014; Israel had worshipped], and he was frightened by it. Then Moses came near and said to him, &#x2018;My brother, Aaron, do not be afraid of that which you fear. Embolden yourself and come near it.&#x2019; This is why he said, <italic>draw near unto the altar</italic>, and [Aaron] drew near unto the altar &#x2014; with zeal.&#x201D; The reason for this [apparition which Aaron saw in the altar] was that since Aaron was <italic>the holy one of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn630">27</xref></sup> having no sin on his soul except for the incident of the golden calf, therefore that sin was firmly fixed in his mind, something like that which is said, <italic>and my sin is ever before me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn631">28</xref></sup> It thus appeared to him as if the form of the calf was there [in the altar] preventing his [attaining] atonement [through the offerings he was to bring]. That is why Moses said to him, &#x201C;Embolden yourself so that you should not be of such humble spirit,&#x201D; <italic>for G-d has already accepted</italic> his <italic>works</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn632">29</xref></sup> Other scholars explain that it was Satan who showed him this apparition, just as they have said there in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn633">30</xref></sup> &#x201C;My brother Aaron, although G-d has agreed to grant atonement for your sin, you must nonetheless close the mouth of Satan [through your offerings], lest he accuse you when you enter the Sanctuary etc.&#x201D; And the expression, <italic>and make atonement for thyself, and for the people</italic> means as follows: &#x201C;<italic>draw near unto the altar</italic> to bring all the offerings, <italic>and offer</italic> first <italic>thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself</italic> first with thy offerings, <italic>and for the people</italic> afterwards, through bringing their offering and atoning for them by means thereof.&#x201D; Thus Moses taught Aaron that the guiltless should come and effect atonement for those who are guilty.<sup><xref rid="fn634">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. BESIDES THE BURNT-OFFERING OF THE MORNING. Scripture had to mention this here, in order to teach us that the burnt-offering of the people [which was a special offering for that day] did not exempt [them from bringing] the Daily burnt-offering, nor did it precede it [as nothing may ever be offered before the Daily burnt-offering of the morning]. But Scripture did not have to mention this about the seven days of consecration [namely that the offerings of those days were to be offered <italic>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</italic>], because those were offerings of individuals [i.e., Aaron and his sons] to consecrate them as priests, and it is self-understood that such offerings did not exempt [them from bringing] the Daily burnt-offering, nor did they precede it.</p>
<p>In the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis have taught:<sup><xref rid="fn635">32</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And the meal-offering was presented; and he filled his hand therefrom and burnt it on the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning</italic>. What does this come to teach us? Shall we say it teaches us that if he could not obtain the meal-offering [which was offered with every burnt-offering] that he should nevertheless bring the animal [as a burnt-offering]? [That could not be the case], for it has already been stated, <italic>And the burnt-offering was presented, and he offered it according to the ordinances</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn636">33</xref></sup> If so, why does it say, <italic>and he burnt it</italic> [i.e., the meal-offering] <italic>upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning</italic>? It is to teach us that there were two meal-offerings there, one for the [Daily] burnt-offering and one [brought] by itself&#x201D; [for the burnt-offering of the people, which was a special offering of that eighth day].</p>
<p>The meaning of this text [of the Torath Kohanim] is as follows: Had Scripture stated, &#x201C;And the burnt-offering was presented, and he offered it according to the ordinance, besides the burnt-offering of the morning,&#x201D; the sense thereof would have been to teach that the Daily burnt-offering precedes [the other offerings], as He says in the section of the Additional Offerings, <italic>it shall be offered beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn637">34</xref></sup> <italic>beside the continual burnt-offering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn638">35</xref></sup> But since He mentioned the meal-offering &#x2014; stating, <italic>And the meal-offering was presented; and he filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it on the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning</italic> &#x2014; it appears that [the phrase, <italic>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</italic>] is said with reference to the meal-offering. Therefore the Rabbis commented that if it comes to say that he offered this meal-offering alone, but did not offer the drink-offering of the Daily burnt-offering nor that of the people&#x2019;s burnt-offering [of the eighth day], because he only found [ingredients] for this freewill meal-offering &#x2014; [that could not be the case]. For [in the preceding verse] it has already been stated, <italic>And the burnt-offering was presented, and he offered it according to the ordinance</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn639">36</xref></sup> which means that it was offered according to its ordinance, with the drink-offering. [Thus we cannot derive from here a principle that the lack of the drink-offering does not prevent the bringing of the offering itself, if the meal-offering and the wine for the drink-offering are not obtainable.] If so, why does it say, <italic>And the meal-offering was presented</italic> etc. <italic>and he burnt it on the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning</italic>? It is to teach that he offered this meal-offering [of the people&#x2019;s burnt-offering brought on the eighth day] &#x201C;<italic>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</italic> and its meal-offering,&#x201D; for this meal-offering was not the drink-offering [which is an obligatory part of the Daily burnt-offering], but was the <italic>freewill</italic> meal-offering of Israel [namely part of the burnt-offering of the people which they brought on that day].<sup><xref rid="fn640">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. &#x2018;V&#x2019;HAMECHASEH&#x2019; AND THAT WHICH COVERETH THE INWARDS. &#x201C;That is, the fat which covers the inwards.&#x201D; Thus the language of Rashi. But it does not appear to me to be correct, for why should He mention [only] this particular fat and not the other fats [which were burnt on the altar]?<sup><xref rid="fn641">38</xref></sup> Rather, the word <italic>hamechaseh</italic> in my opinion is a term for all the fats, since all fats which are burnt on the altar are &#x201C;covering&#x201D; [fats]. One is <italic>the fat which covereth the inwards</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn642">39</xref></sup> and the second is <italic>all the fat that is upon the inwards</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn642">39</xref></sup> and that too &#x201C;covers&#x201D; [the inwards]; the fat which is upon the kidneys covers them, as does also the fat <italic>which is upon the loins</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn643">40</xref></sup> This is similar to that which the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn644">41</xref></sup> &#x201C;Fat which the meat covers is permissible to be eaten, for the Merciful One said, the fat <italic>which is upon the loins</italic> [is called &#x2018;fat&#x2019;], and not that which is within the loins.&#x201D; This verse is thus a continuation of the above: <italic>and Aaron&#x2019;s sons delivered unto him the blood</italic><sup><xref rid="fn645">42</xref></sup> of the ox and the ram mentioned [in the first part of that verse], <italic>and the fat of the ox</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn646">43</xref></sup> but <italic>of the ram</italic> they presented to him the fat tail and &#x201C;the fat&#x201D; [as the word <italic>mechaseh</italic> indicates], and of the two [the ox and the ram, they presented to him] <italic>the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver</italic>. Scripture states, <italic>And they put the fat upon the breasts</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn647">44</xref></sup> for they placed the fat tail, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver at the bottom, and the [other] fats on the top of them, and everything upon the breasts. Thus the fats alone were visible above, this being the respectful way to burn them [on the altar].</p>
<p>20. AND HE BURNT THE FAT UPON THE ALTAR &#x2014; together with the others mentioned [namely, <italic>the fat tail, and that which covereth the inwards, and the lobe of the liver</italic>, and the breasts]. But because the burning of the fats is greater, He mentions [only] them. Similarly, <italic>it consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fats</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn648">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND AARON LIFTED UP HIS HANDS TOWARD THE PEOPLE, AND BLESSED THEM &#x2014; &#x201C;with the priestly benediction: <italic>The Eternal bless thee</italic> &#x2026;. <italic>The Eternal make His face shine upon thee &#x2026; The Eternal lift up His countenance upon thee &#x2026;</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn649">46</xref></sup> Thus the language of Rashi. But if so, the section of <italic>Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying: Thus ye shall bless the children of Israel</italic>, in the Book of Numbers,<sup><xref rid="fn650">47</xref></sup> takes chronological precedence over this section&#x0021; Perhaps it is [indeed] so since it is placed near to that which it says there, <italic>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the Tabernacle</italic><sup><xref rid="fn651">48</xref></sup> [which was on the first of Nisan &#x2014; &#x201C;the eighth day&#x201D; herein discussed].</p>
<p>It is possible to say that Aaron spread forth his hands towards heaven and blessed the people, just as Solomon did, as it is said, <italic>And Solomon stood before the altar of the Eternal in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands, toward heaven</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn652">49</xref></sup> and there it is said, <italic>And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying</italic>, etc.<sup><xref rid="fn653">50</xref></sup> Therefore Scripture does not mention that Moses commanded him to do so [i.e., to say the priestly blessing, since it had in fact not yet been given].</p>
<p>In the Beraitha<sup><xref rid="fn654">51</xref></sup> of the section of consecration in the Torath Kohanim I have seen it said:<sup><xref rid="fn655">52</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And he blessed them</italic>. This is an unspecified blessing [the nature of which] you do not know. Scripture [therefore] went back and explained it further on: <italic>The Eternal bless thee, and keep thee. The Eternal make His face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee. The Eternal lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn649">46</xref></sup> Nonetheless, I could still say that the Rabbis of this Beraitha were saying as follows: &#x201C;This blessing with which Aaron blessed the people of his own accord, is unspecified, and Scripture did not explain to us what it was. But the blessing that the priests have been commanded to say in all future generations, has been expressly set forth, it applying to all priests alike forever. Or it may be that [the Rabbis of this Beraitha] are of the opinion that here He commanded him [to say] the priestly blessing for that day, and later on [as stated in the Book of Numbers] this blessing was given to Aaron and his sons for the succeeding generations.</p>

<p>2. AND THERE CAME FORTH FIRE &#x2018;MILIPHNEI&#x2019; (FROM BEFORE) THE ETERNAL. The meaning of &#x201C;<italic>miliphnei</italic> the Eternal&#x201D; is like: &#x201C;from before the <italic>pnei</italic> (presence of) the Eternal.&#x201D; The student learned [in the mystic lore of the Cabala] will understand, for I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn656">53</xref></sup> The nature of the sin of Nadab and Abihu you may know from that which it says, <italic>and they offered &#x2018;strange fire&#x2019; before the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn657">54</xref></sup> and it does not say &#x201C;and they offered before the Eternal &#x2018;incense&#x2019; which He had not commanded them.&#x201D; Thus they put incense upon the fire, similarly to that which Scripture says, <italic>they shall put incense &#x2018;b&#x2019;apecha&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>before Thee</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn658">55</xref></sup> and they directed their thoughts only to this,<sup><xref rid="fn659">56</xref></sup> and thus it was not <italic>a fire-offering of a sweet savor</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn660">57</xref></sup> This is the sense of the expression, <italic>and they laid &#x2018;aleha&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>upon her</italic>) <italic>incense</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn661">58</xref></sup> and it does not say &#x201C;and they laid upon them [i.e., the censers] incense,&#x201D; as is said with reference to the company of Korah, <italic>and put fire therein, and put incense upon them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn662">59</xref></sup> and again it is said there, <italic>and put incense upon them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn663">60</xref></sup> But here it says <italic>upon her</italic>, to allude [to the fact] that they put the incense only on &#x201C;the fire,&#x201D; [and therefore it says], <italic>And there came forth fire from before the Eternal, and devoured them</italic>. It is possible that the verse which He said, <italic>Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn664">61</xref></sup> alludes to this, meaning that he should not cause it [the fire] to be strange. It is in connection with this that Scripture states, <italic>when they</italic> [Nadab and Abihu] <italic>drew near before the Eternal, and died</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn665">62</xref></sup> which means &#x201C;when they offered <italic>l&#x2019;phanav</italic> they died.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn666">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. THIS IS THAT THE ETERNAL SPOKE, SAYING: &#x2018;THROUGH THEM THAT ARE NIGH UNTO ME I WILL BE SANCTIFIED.&#x2019; &#x201C;Where had He spoken this? In the verse, <italic>and</italic> [the Tent] <italic>shall be sanctified &#x2018;bichvodi&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>by My Glory</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn667">64</xref></sup> Do not read the word as <italic>bichvodi</italic> (by My Glory) but <italic>bimechubodai</italic> (through My honored ones). Moses said to Aaron: &#x2018;My brother Aaron, I knew that this Sanctuary was to be hallowed by those who are beloved of the Holy One, blessed be He, and I thought that it would be either through me or through you. Now I see that your sons were holier<sup><xref rid="fn668">65</xref></sup> than I and you.&#x2019; &#x201D; Thus the language of Rashi, based on the interpretation of our Rabbis. But if so, the verse, <italic>and</italic> [the Tent] <italic>shall be sanctified &#x2018;bichvodi&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn667">64</xref></sup> means &#x201C;that it will become holy in the eyes of all the people through my honored ones, and they will know that I dwell therein.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra also wrote: &#x201C;<italic>This is that the Eternal spoke, saying</italic>, means: G-d had already told me that He would show His sanctity through those that were near to Him. This is similar in meaning to the verse, <italic>You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn669">66</xref></sup> And when I will show them this holiness of Mine, then I will become glorified before all the people and they will fear Me.&#x201D; But if this is so, then this is a statement not written [in the text], that G-d informed Moses of His ways and that such is the nature of His attribute&#x0021;</p>
<p>In my opinion there is no need for all this. For by way of the plain meaning of Scripture, the expression &#x201C;G-d spoke&#x201D; refers to His decrees, His thought, and the manner of His ways, and the term &#x201C;speaking&#x201D; is used with reference to all these [in humans]. Thus: <italic>I spoke with my own heart</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn670">67</xref></sup> means &#x201C;I reflected on this thought.&#x201D; <italic>And this is &#x2018;hadavar&#x2019; that Joshua did circumcise</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn671">68</xref></sup> means &#x201C;this is &#x2018;the cause&#x2019; why Joshua did so.&#x201D; &#x2018;<italic>Al d&#x2019;var</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>because of</italic>) <italic>the money</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn672">69</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>And let her be thy master&#x2019;s son&#x2019;s wife, as the Eternal hath spoken</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn673">70</xref></sup> means &#x201C;as He hath decreed.&#x201D; Likewise: <italic>In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite built Jericho; with his firstborn he laid the foundation thereof, and with his youngest son Segub he set up the gates thereof; according to the word of the Eternal, which He spoke by the hand of Joshua the son of Nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn674">71</xref></sup> Thus Moses said here: &#x201C;This incident is that which G-d decreed, &#x2018;saying to His heart&#x2019;: <italic>Through them that are nigh unto Me I will be sanctified</italic> so that they should not break forth into My sanctity; <italic>and before all the people I will be glorified</italic>, so that they treat My dwelling-place with respect.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x2018;VAYIDOM AHARON&#x2019; (AND AARON WAS SILENT). This means that he had cried aloud, but then he became silent. Or perhaps the meaning thereof is as in the verse, <italic>let not the apple of thine eye &#x2018;tidom&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>cease</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn675">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND MOSES CALLED MISHAEL AND ELZAPHAN, THE SONS OF UZZIEL THE UNCLE OF AARON, AND SAID UNTO THEM: DRAW NEAR, CARRY YOUR BRETHREN FROM BEFORE THE SANCTUARY OUT OF THE CAMP. I have found written in the Torath Kohanim in the section of the consecration:<sup><xref rid="fn676">73</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Eliezer says: the sons of Aaron died outside [the Sanctuary], in a place where the Levites [Mishael and Elzaphan] were permitted to enter, as it is said, <italic>So they drew near, and carried them in their tunics</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn677">74</xref></sup> If so, why then does it say, <italic>and they died before the Eternal?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn678">75</xref></sup> It was an angel who smote them [Nadab and Abihu] and thrust them out of the Sanctuary [and they did not die until they were outside it]. Rabbi Akiba says: they died inside the Sanctuary, as it is said, <italic>and they died before the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn678">75</xref></sup> If so, why does it say, <italic>So they drew near, and carried them in their tunics</italic><sup><xref rid="fn677">74</xref></sup> [since Levites are not permitted to enter the Sanctuary]? They put iron hooks on them, and dragged them and brought them out of the Sanctuary.&#x201D; Thus far is the text of the Beraitha,<sup><xref rid="fn654">51</xref></sup> and the meaning thereof is as follows: Even though priests are also forbidden to enter the Sanctuary except at the time of Service,<sup><xref rid="fn679">76</xref></sup> this prohibition applies only if they enter it needlessly. But one may enter the Sanctuary in order to remove an uncleanness, or to make Temple repairs. For thus we were taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn680">77</xref></sup> &#x201C;I might think one is not permitted to enter the Sanctuary to make the beaten plates [for a covering of the golden altar, or for the Holy of Holies]; Scripture therefore says, <italic>&#x2018;Only&#x2019; he shall not go in unto the Veil</italic><sup><xref rid="fn681">78</xref></sup> [the word &#x2018;only&#x2019; denoting an exception to the general law]; such is their command: priests may go in there [at any time to make the above repairs]. If there are no priests present, Levites may enter. If there are no [ritually] pure ones [priests or Levites], impure ones may go in. If there are no unblemished ones, blemished ones may enter there.&#x201D; Now on that day [when Nadab and Abihu died] there were no priests present [who could remove them from the Sanctuary where they had died], since [Aaron and his two remaining sons] were expressly commanded that they should not defile themselves for them.<sup><xref rid="fn682">79</xref></sup> But since it was possible to do it through dragging them out with iron hooks, [Mishael and Elzaphan] were not permitted to enter there. [Such is the opinion of Rabbi Akiba.] But Rabbi Eliezer, who is of the opinion [that an angel thrust Nadab and Abihu out of the Sanctuary, and they died outside, thinks] that since Scripture states of Mishael and Elzaphan, <italic>so they drew near</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn677">74</xref></sup> it was outside the Sanctuary [that they died], and therefore he does not say [as does Rabbi Akiba] that they dragged them outside in their tunics. The meaning of the expression <italic>in their tunics</italic><sup><xref rid="fn677">74</xref></sup> is that Nadab and Abihu were then dressed in the priestly garments. Moses thus commanded that they carry them <italic>out of the camp</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn677">74</xref></sup> and there they should strip them of their priestly garments, and clothe them in burial shrouds, and bury them, as was their custom with other people who died in the desert. After that they purified the sacred garments and they were used by the other priests.</p>
<p>6. LET NOT THE HAIR OF YOUR HEADS GO LOOSE. &#x201C;[This means]: do not grow your hair long. From this [the fact that Scripture forbade these particular mourners to let their hair grow long], we learn that a mourner is forbidden to cut his hair. [Moses thus said to them: Normally a mourner may not cut his hair], but you must not disturb the joy of G-d. THAT YE DIE NOT. But if you do this you shall die.&#x201D; Thus far the language of Rashi.</p>
<p>Now that which Rashi says, &#x201C;From this we learn that a mourner is forbidden to cut his hair,&#x201D; is merely a Scriptural support for a Rabbinic enactment.<sup><xref rid="fn683">80</xref></sup> Moreover, according to this explanation one cannot then interpret: &#x201C;But if you do this [i.e., you let your hair grow long] you shall die.&#x201D; Rather<sup><xref rid="fn684">81</xref></sup> it was optional in the case of Aaron&#x2019;s sons, Scripture stating: &#x201C;You are not <italic>obliged</italic> to let your hair grow long and rend your garments, as are other mourners; <italic>that ye die not</italic>, meaning that you will not be liable to death if you do so [i.e., neither let your hair grow nor rend your garments], but <italic>other</italic> mourners are liable [to death] if they fail to observe it.&#x201D; Thus also have the Rabbis said in the Gemara of <italic>Mashkin:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn685">82</xref></sup> &#x201C;A mourner who did not let his hair grow long, and did not rent his garments, is liable [to punishment of death], as it is said, <italic>Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes, that ye die not;</italic> but other mourners who do not let their hair grow long, or rend their garments, are liable [to that punishment].&#x201D; But this text is similar to other Rabbinic laws for which the Talmud merely found a Scriptural support, for letting one&#x2019;s hair grow long and rending one&#x2019;s garments when in mourning are only matters of Rabbinic ordinance. Or perhaps the mourning of the first day [after the death and burial] is a law given to Moses at Sinai, being derived from that of <italic>aninuth</italic> [the state of mourning <italic>before</italic> the burial of a relative] according to the opinion of the Gaonim.<sup><xref rid="fn686">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>But the real meaning of the verse is an admonition to Aaron&#x2019;s sons, and listen to the meaning thereof. Our Rabbis have already said<sup><xref rid="fn687">84</xref></sup> that a High Priest may bring an offering whilst he is still an <italic>onen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn688">85</xref></sup> but may not eat it. If any of his next of kin<sup><xref rid="fn689">86</xref></sup> die, he is not allowed to let his hair grow or rend his garments or defile himself for them, as it is said, <italic>he shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes; neither shall he enter</italic> [a tent containing] <italic>a dead body</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn690">87</xref></sup> Now since he is permitted to bring offerings whilst he is an <italic>onen</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn688">85</xref></sup> Scripture therefore said about him, <italic>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane the Sanctuary of his G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn691">88</xref></sup> This means that He warned him against going out of the Sanctuary and leaving the Service, for this would be a profanation of G-d&#x2019;s Name. Now this warning against leaving the Sanctuary at the time of the Service applies to all priests, except that in the case of the High Priest He taught that he may bring offerings whilst he is still an <italic>onen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn688">85</xref></sup> [whereas an ordinary priest must interrupt his Service and another one completes it, and he is not permitted to leave the Sanctuary until it is completed]. Accordingly, if the High Priest [on becoming apprised of the death of a near relative], leaves the Service and goes out of the Sanctuary whilst he is an <italic>onen</italic>, he is liable [to punishment] just like any [ordinary] priest who leaves the Service and goes as he pleases.</p>
<p>Now Moses warned Aaron here that he should not let his hair grow long, nor rend his garments, for this [negative] commandment applies to him [as High Priest] for all times. But his sons who were ordinary priests, were not permitted to bring offerings on that day since they were <italic>onenim</italic> [mourners whose dead are still unburied], and an <italic>onen</italic> who officiates profanes the Service. They were in fact obliged to defile themselves for their brothers, and similarly they were either permitted or obliged<sup><xref rid="fn692">89</xref></sup> to let their hair grow and to rend their garments. Yet Moses warned them against doing all this as a special decision [&#x201C;in order not to disturb the joy of G-d&#x201D; on that occasion, as mentioned above by Rashi]. Therefore Moses charged Mishael and Elzaphan that <italic>they</italic> should defile themselves for the dead, and not the priests. He further commanded [the priests] not to let their hair grow, nor to rend their garments, just like their father, [who as High Priest was not permitted to do so], and not to cry at all. This is the meaning of the verse, <italic>but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Eternal hath kindled</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn693">90</xref></sup> but not you. All this was in order not to disturb G-d&#x2019;s joy [by their displaying signs of mourning]. He treated this strictly by making them liable to death [by the hand of Heaven] if they would disturb the joyous occasion in any way.</p>
<p>It is possible that Moses was commanded about this from the mouth of the Almighty, even though it is not expressly written, or that he derived it from that which he was commanded [to relay to Aaron and his sons for the seven days of consecration], <italic>and ye shall keep the charge of the Eternal, that ye die not</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn694">91</xref></sup> [from which Moses learned] that <italic>the charge of the Eternal</italic> includes also the eighth day. Now it was revealed to and known by the Creator of the world that the sons of Aaron were destined to be <italic>onenim</italic>, and yet He commanded that they should not leave the Sanctuary; thus [we see that here exceptionally] they were not to defile themselves for the dead or to mourn at all.</p>
<p>Now <italic>the sons of Aaron, the priests that were anointed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn695">92</xref></sup> even though they were ordinary priests, yet [G-d] made the law applicable to them during the days of the consecration to be like the law of the priest anointed for war in future generations,<sup><xref rid="fn696">93</xref></sup> since he [too] must not let his hair grow long or rend his garments or defile himself for deceased relatives, just like the High Priest, but he may not perform the rites of offerings whilst he is an <italic>onen</italic> [although the High Priest may do so]. Thus Aaron&#x2019;s sons, too, did not perform the rites of the offerings on that day, as the Rabbis interpreted:<sup><xref rid="fn697">94</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And Aaron spoke unto Moses: Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn698">95</xref></sup> Did they [i.e., my sons] then bring the offering &#x2014; they who are ordinary priests? It was I [Aaron] that offered &#x2014; I who am the High Priest [who may offer even when being an <italic>onen</italic>].&#x201D; Now during this entire incident nothing [which was to be done during] the consecration was abolished, since the offerings had already been brought, and at night they all ate of the hallowed food which they were to eat. It is possible that this law applied to Elazar and Ithamar [Aaron&#x2019;s remaining sons] all their lives, namely, that their laws be like those of the priest anointed for war [as mentioned above], because they had been anointed with the oil of anointment, this being the sense of the expression, [<italic>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting &#x2026;</italic>] <italic>for the anointing oil of the Eternal is upon you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn699">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>I have already mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn700">97</xref></sup> the Beraitha of the Torath Kohanim<sup><xref rid="fn701">98</xref></sup> which states: &#x201C;<italic>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn699">96</xref></sup> I might think that [on becoming apprised of the death of a near relative, an ordinary priest may not leave the Sanctuary] whether he is ministering or not; Scripture therefore says, <italic>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn702">99</xref></sup> When is he not permitted to go out, so that [only by his staying there] he does not profane it? I must say that this applies only when he is ministering. <italic>Lest ye die</italic><sup><xref rid="fn699">96</xref></sup> &#x2014; from the negative you infer the positive [that if they do go out in the middle of their ministering, they are liable to death by the hand of Heaven]. <italic>For the anointing oil of the Eternal is upon you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn699">96</xref></sup> Why is this said? I might think that this tells me only that Aaron and his sons, who were anointed with the oil of anointment, are liable to death if they leave the Sanctuary whilst they are ministering. How do I know that [the prohibition applies also to] all priests at all times? Scripture therefore says, <italic>for the anointing oil of the Eternal is upon you</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn703">100</xref></sup> Similarly have I also seen in the Tosephta<sup><xref rid="fn704">101</xref></sup> of Tractate Sanhedrin: &#x201C;The Sages said to Rabbi Yehudah: The verse <italic>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary</italic><sup><xref rid="fn702">99</xref></sup> only applies at the time of ministration.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now according to this interpretation, the warning and punishment [under consideration] applied to [both] Aaron and his sons, so that if they went out from the door of the Tent of Meeting<sup><xref rid="fn699">96</xref></sup> at the time of performing the Service, they would be liable [to death by the hand of Heaven]. But since it was Aaron who brought the offerings on that day, therefore [Moses] warned him [especially] that he should not leave the Service and go out. His sons, however, were <italic>onenim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn688">85</xref></sup> on that day and did not perform the Service. If so, [the question appears]: how were they included in this warning [not to leave the Service and go out of the Sanctuary, when they were in fact doing no Service to begin with]? Perhaps we may say that Moses said to all of them, <italic>and ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</italic> at the time of the Service, <italic>lest ye die</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn699">96</xref></sup> and they knew that Aaron [as High Priest] could perform the rites of offering [although] an <italic>onen</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn688">85</xref></sup> and therefore he is included in the prohibition at once, but his sons are included in the prohibition and punishment whenever they would be fit for the Service from that day onwards. It is for this reason that He said here in an unqualified manner, <italic>and ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn699">96</xref></sup> and did not explain until when this [prohibition] applied, whether until the evening or the next day, since His intent was that they should not leave the Service, and this was to be a commandment applying to all generations.</p>
<p>It is possible that the command to the sons of Aaron was a special decision, that they should not go out from there on that day<sup><xref rid="fn705">102</xref></sup> [specifically], just as their father [could not leave], this being in honor of the joyous occasion [i.e., the culmination of the erection of the Tabernacle and inauguration of the priests], but ordinary priests throughout the generations are warned against leaving their Service on the basis of the verse which states, <italic>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn702">99</xref></sup> which means that any priest who goes out of the Sanctuary and leaves his Service profanes it thereby. Thus the verse here [<italic>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest ye die, for the anointing oil of the Eternal is upon you</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn699">96</xref></sup> is only necessary to derive the punishment, that whoever leaves the Service and goes out is subject to death [by the hand of Heaven], for it says, <italic>for the anointing oil of the Eternal is upon you</italic>, and that anointment is upon them for all generations, as it says, <italic>and their anointing oil shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn706">103</xref></sup> So also the Rabbis taught in the Beraitha of Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn707">104</xref></sup> &#x201C;From here the Rabbis have derived the principle that no mark of mourning whatever is shown for those executed by the court.<sup><xref rid="fn708">105</xref></sup> Perhaps you will say, &#x2018;We [the brothers] will go to our homes and mourn, grieve and cry [over the death of Nadab and Abihu], behold G-d has already commanded us not to go out of the Sanctuary.&#x2019; &#x201D; From this text it would appear that it was a special decision to the effect that those who died through the Heavenly Court, should be treated like those executed by a [human] court for transgressions, in which case the rule is that [the relatives of the executed] come and greet the judges and the witnesses.<sup><xref rid="fn709">106</xref></sup> Here too, they were to remain standing before G-d <italic>in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn710">107</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>In the day of his espousals</italic> &#x2014; this is the day of Sinai [i.e., the Giving of the Torah]. <italic>And in the day of the gladness of his heart</italic> &#x2014; this is the day [of the setting up] of the Tent of Meeting.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn711">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. DRINK NO WINE NOR STRONG DRINK. &#x201C;[Do not drink] wine to such an extent that it has an intoxicating effect.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. The meaning thereof is that if he paused during the drinking [of a fourth of a log of wine], or if he mixed a little water into it, he is free from punishment. The opinion of the Rabbi [Rashi] is thus that the priests were only prohibited from drinking wine, but not from other intoxicating drinks, the meaning of the term <italic>sheichar</italic> (strong drink) mentioned here being derived from the law of the Nazirite [where a similar expression appears,<sup><xref rid="fn712">109</xref></sup> and only wine is forbidden to him].<sup><xref rid="fn713">110</xref></sup> This is correct according to my opinion. But in the opinion of Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon],<sup><xref rid="fn714">111</xref></sup> however, other intoxicating drinks are prohibited [through a negative commandment, without being punishable by death, and the Service performed after drinking them is not invalidated, whereas for drinking wine the punishment is death by the hand of Heaven, and the Service is invalidated]; thus <italic>sheichar</italic> is to be understood in its plain sense [i.e., strong drink]. The reason why this commandment was given at that time, was in order that the priest should not go astray through the intoxicating effect of wine, and thus come to entertain some improper thought which might cause his death, as happened to [Aaron&#x2019;s] sons. It is possible that when the Rabbis interpreted<sup><xref rid="fn715">112</xref></sup> that Nadab and Abihu died because they entered the Sanctuary whilst intoxicated by wine, they meant to say that it was because of the wine they had drunk that they erred in the matter of the strange fire,<sup><xref rid="fn716">113</xref></sup> but not that their punishment actually was because they had drunk the wine, since they had not yet been warned against it. Rather, their punishment was because they erred with respect to the fire of G-d, as I have alluded to.<sup><xref rid="fn716">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHEN YE GO INTO THE TENT OF MEETING. &#x201C;From this verse I know only [that they are forbidden to drink wine and strong drink] when they go into the Sanctuary. Whence do I know that this applies also whenever they approach the altar? Entering the Tent of Meeting is mentioned here, and entering the Tent is also mentioned in connection with the washing of hands and feet.<sup><xref rid="fn717">114</xref></sup> Now just as there the Torah made approaching the altar similar to entering the Tent of Meeting, so here too it made approaching the altar like entering the Tent of Meeting.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, and that of the Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn718">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>It would appear from this analogy that a priest [drunk with wine] is not liable to death for approaching the altar or for entering the Sanctuary, unless he performed there some [Divine] Service, just as in the case of washing the hands and feet, where the admonition is only against performing the Service [without washing], as it says, <italic>or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn a fire-offering unto the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn717">114</xref></sup> In this form it is taught there in the Sifra:<sup><xref rid="fn719">116</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi<sup><xref rid="fn720">117</xref></sup> states: Here it says, <italic>when ye go into the Tent of Meeting</italic>, and there [in connection with the law of the priests washing their hands and feet] it says, <italic>when they go into the Tent of Meeting</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn717">114</xref></sup> Now just as there He made going out [of the Sanctuary] similar to going into it,<sup><xref rid="fn721">118</xref></sup> and the altar similar to the Tent of Meeting, and the penalty of death [by the hand of Heaven] is only if he performed the Service [without washing], so here also He made going out [of the Sanctuary] similar to going into it,<sup><xref rid="fn722">119</xref></sup> and the altar similar to the Tent of Meeting, and the punishment is only if he performs the Service [whilst intoxicated].&#x201D; That is to say, the liability [to punishment] is only if the priest performs the Service, whether he entered while drunk, or drank there [after he had come in] and then performed some Service. There [in the Sifra]<sup><xref rid="fn723">120</xref></sup> the Rabbis have said: &#x201C;<italic>It shall be a statute forever</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn724">121</xref></sup> This includes the pouring of oil [upon the flour of a meal-offering], mixing it, waving it, bringing near [the meal-offering to the altar], removing the handful and burning it, pinching a bird&#x2019;s head, and sprinkling the blood,&#x201D; [so that all these acts must not be done by the priest while drunk, and if he did any of them in that state, he is liable to death by the hand of Heaven]. For since Scripture stated, <italic>to burn a fire-offering unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn717">114</xref></sup> [I might have excluded these acts from this law since they are not &#x201C;a fire-offering&#x201D;], therefore it was necessary to include them [here in the verse before us].</p>
<p>It further appears that this liability [to punishment] does not apply where one offers up on a <italic>bamah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn725">122</xref></sup> That is why the Rabbis said there [in the Torath Kohanim]:<sup><xref rid="fn723">120</xref></sup> &#x201C;From this verse I know only that it is prohibited [to perform the Service] in the Tent of Meeting [while drunk]. Whence do I know to include the Sanctuary at Shiloh and the Eternal House at Jerusalem? Scripture therefore says, <italic>it shall be a statute for ever</italic>.&#x201D; For this prohibition applies to the priests performing their Services, and it was not necessary that it be a priest who performed the Service at a <italic>bamah;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn725">122</xref></sup> [therefore the prohibition did not apply there].</p>
<p>Now the meaning of the expression <italic>when ye go into the Tent of Meeting</italic>, is &#x201C;when you perform Service,&#x201D; and He used this expression because all the Services were done there, either inside the Tent or at the altar of the burnt-offering which was at the door of the Tent of Meeting. The general principle then, is that the prohibition and punishment in these matters are only to the effect that the priest should not perform the Service while drunk with wine or with hands and feet unwashed, likewise if he lacks any of the required priestly garments; but merely for entering the Sanctuary in these conditions, there is no prohibition in the Torah. Thus that which we have been taught in the Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn726">123</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Yosei says: In five things is the space between the Porch [of the Sanctuary] and the altar equal to the Sanctuary: that those priests may not enter there who have a blemish, or who have dishevelled hair,<sup><xref rid="fn727">124</xref></sup> or who have hands and feet unwashed&#x201D; and the whole Mishnah there &#x2014; all these are gradations of <italic>Rabbinic</italic> enactment [and are not matters prohibited by Scriptural law]. In the opinion, however, of Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon],<sup><xref rid="fn728">125</xref></sup> one who [wilfully] enters the Sanctuary [in the above-mentioned conditions] without performing the Service, [has also violated] a negative commandment, for which the punishment is not death [by the hand of Heaven but whipping].</p>
<p>15. THE THIGH OF HEAVING AND THE BREAST OF WAVING. &#x201C;This expression is similar to the verse, [<italic>the breast of the wave-offering, and the thigh of the heave-offering</italic>], <italic>which is waved, and which is heaved up</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn729">126</xref></sup> &#x2018;Waving&#x2019; is an expression for moving to and fro [in a horizontal direction]. &#x2018;Heaving&#x2019; is an expression for moving up and down. But why Scripture divided them, mentioning &#x2018;heaving&#x2019; in connection with the thigh and &#x2018;waving&#x2019; in connection with the breast, I do not know, for both of them [required] waving and heaving.&#x201D; Thus far is the language of Rashi.<sup><xref rid="fn730">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears to me that the reason for it is that during the [seven days of] consecration, the thigh was a heave-offering to G-d, being burned together with the bread and the fats,<sup><xref rid="fn731">128</xref></sup> and that which is set aside from a peace-offering [to be burnt on the altar] is called &#x201C;a heave-offering,&#x201D; just as it is said, <italic>And of it he shall offer one out of each offering for a heave-offering unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn732">129</xref></sup> and [it follows] all the more so that these parts [of the ram of consecration] offered on the altar, were all &#x201C;a heave-offering unto the Eternal.&#x201D; [Hence the expression &#x201C;the thigh of <italic>heaving</italic>.&#x201D;] It was not called by the term &#x201C;waving,&#x201D; for that movement [to and fro in a horizontal direction] was done to the thigh together with the fats and the bread so as to burn them unto the Eternal. The breast, however, was waved by itself, and was only different from the rest of the meat [which was to be eaten by the priests] in that it was waved, and it was through this waving alone that it became sanctified and that Moses acquired it as his portion.<sup><xref rid="fn733">130</xref></sup> Now since the right of Aaron and his sons to the breast and thigh [of peace-offerings] in future generations was [derived] from the day of their consecration as priests, when they acquired the thigh through its being a heave-offering to G-d and the breast through its being waved, whilst the rest of the meat belonged to the owners, therefore the thigh was forever called [the thigh of] &#x201C;heaving,&#x201D; and the breast that of &#x201C;waving,&#x201D; as was done to them on the day of [the priests] acquiring their rights to them.</p>
<p>&#x2018;AL ISHEI HACHALAVIM&#x2019; (UPON THE FIRE-OFFERINGS OF THE FAT). &#x201C;This is like: &#x2018;upon the fat of the fire-offerings.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn734">131</xref></sup> From here we learn that at the time of waving the fat-portions were beneath.&#x201D; This is the language of Rashi. But there is no need for it [i.e., to invert the verse, and to derive this law from the verse here]. For the word <italic>ishei</italic> (&#x201C;fire-offerings of&#x201D;) is an adjectival-noun qualifying the word <italic>chalavim</italic> (fats), just as He said, <italic>&#x2018;ishei Hashem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the fire-offerings of the Eternal</italic>) <italic>and His inheritance they</italic> [the priests] <italic>shall eat</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn735">132</xref></sup> The explanation of this verse is that it constitutes a reason for that which He said [in the preceding verse], <italic>for they</italic> [the offerings] <italic>are given as thy due, and thy sons&#x2019; due, out of the offerings of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn736">133</xref></sup> [With reference to this] He now said, <italic>The thigh of heaving and the breast of waving shall they</italic> &#x2014; that is, the children of Israel, mentioned [in the previous verse] &#x2014; <italic>bring upon the fire-offerings of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before the Eternal</italic>, that they [i.e., the thigh and the breast] be hallowed before Him, and they <italic>shall be thine and thy sons&#x2019; with thee, as a due forever</italic>. For this is not the place of the command concerning the waving,<sup><xref rid="fn737">134</xref></sup> but incidentally<sup><xref rid="fn738">135</xref></sup> we learn that at the time of waving the fats were beneath the others.</p>
<p>16. AND MOSES DILIGENTLY INQUIRED FOR THE GOAT OF THE SIN-OFFERING, AND BEHOLD, IT WAS BURNT. &#x201C;This was the he-goat of the Additional Offerings of the New Moon.<sup><xref rid="fn739">136</xref></sup> Three he-goats for sin-offerings were offered up that day: [the people&#x2019;s sin-offering brought especially on that day, as it is said], <italic>Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn740">137</xref></sup> and the he-goat brought by Nachshon [in honor of the dedication of the altar],<sup><xref rid="fn741">138</xref></sup> and the he-goat for the New Moon.<sup><xref rid="fn739">136</xref></sup> Of all these, it was only the he-goat for the New Moon that was burnt [although ordinarily it would have been eaten by the priests]. The Sages of Israel differed regarding the reason why it was burnt. Some say that it was burnt on account of some impure object that touched it, and some say it was burnt on account of the mourning [of Aaron&#x2019;s sons].&#x201D; All this is the language of Rashi.</p>
<p>It is in accordance with the opinion of those<sup><xref rid="fn742">139</xref></sup> who say that it was burnt on account of some impure object that touched it, that the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote on the verse, &#x201C;<italic>and if I had eaten of the sin-offering &#x2018;today&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn743">140</xref></sup> &#x2014; by &#x2018;day&#x2019; it was forbidden to eat thereof, but in the case of an <italic>onen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn688">85</xref></sup> on the night [following the death and burial] it is permitted [to eat the offering], since the [Scriptural] law of the <italic>onen</italic> applies only to the <italic>day</italic> of burial.&#x201D; Accordingly, if it was burnt on account of mourning, they should have [left it to be] eaten at night&#x0021; We must perforce say that those Rabbis [who say that it was burnt on account of mourning] are of the opinion that the [Scriptural] law of an <italic>onen</italic> [forbidding him to eat an offering] applies even on the night following the burial&#x0021; [Therefore Aaron&#x2019;s defense of his sons&#x2019; action in burning the sin-offering was correct, since they could not have eaten of it even at night. But Rashi, who is of the opinion that an <italic>onen</italic> may eat the offering at night, must hold that the reason why they burnt it, was on account of some impure object which touched the offering, as a result of which it could never be eaten, and hence Aaron&#x2019;s defense of them was completely correct.]</p>
<p>19. AND AARON SPOKE UNTO MOSES: BEHOLD, THIS DAY HAVE THEY OFFERED. &#x201C;What did Aaron mean to say by this? But [the explanation is]: Moses had said to them: &#x2018;Perhaps you sprinkled the blood of [the sin-offering of the New Moon] whilst you were <italic>onenim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn688">85</xref></sup> and an <italic>onen</italic> who performs the Service invalidates [the offering, and therefore you burnt it]?&#x2019; To this Aaron replied [that Moses should not be angry with his sons]: &#x2018;Did <italic>they</italic> bring the offerings [on that day] &#x2014; they who are ordinary priests? It was I that offered &#x2014; and I, as High Priest, am permitted to offer when an <italic>onen</italic>.&#x2019; &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn744">141</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. So too is it found in the Gemara [of Tractate Zebachim], in the Chapter <italic>Tebul Yom:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn745">142</xref></sup> [Moses said to Aaron&#x2019;s sons]: &#x201C;But perhaps you offered it [while you were <italic>onenim</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn688">85</xref></sup> and thus you invalidated it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But I wonder&#x0021; For all the offerings were brought before they became mourners, as it is written, <italic>and he</italic> Aaron] <italic>came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn746">143</xref></sup> and afterwards they entered the Tent of Meeting<sup><xref rid="fn747">144</xref></sup> and prayed, following which there came forth the fire [that consumed] the offerings<sup><xref rid="fn748">145</xref></sup> and only then did Nadab and Abihu offer up this incense&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn749">146</xref></sup> [So how could Moses have thought that Elazar and Ithamar had performed the Service while they were mourners because of the death of their brothers, since their death occurred only <italic>after</italic> the performing of the Service&#x0021;]<sup><xref rid="fn750">147</xref></sup> Perhaps Moses had not seen their acts, and was therefore afraid that they may have found the blood of this sin-offering [of the New Moon] which had not yet been sprinkled [upon the altar], and that they sprinkled it. So Aaron told Moses: &#x201C;The sprinkling was to be done by me, and when it was [in fact] sprinkled, it was done by my hand and thus the offering did not become invalidated by mourning [since the High Priest may bring offerings even when an <italic>onen</italic>].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn751">148</xref></sup> But the whole discussion [between Moses and Aaron] was theoretical, for nothing at all was done while they were in a state of mourning [since all the offerings had in fact been brought before the death of Nadab and Abihu].</p>
<h1>11</h1>
<p>1. AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND TO AARON, SAYING UNTO THEM: 2. SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The commandments [mentioned] in these sections apply to both Israelites and the priests, but their subject-matter affects mostly the priests, for they must always guard themselves from touching impure objects, since they have to come into the Sanctuary and eat the hallowed food [which they may not do when they are impure]. Moreover, when an Israelite errs in these matters, he has to bring an offering [to effect atonement for his transgression],<sup><xref rid="fn752">149</xref></sup> which the priests offer up. Furthermore, He commanded them, <italic>And that ye may put difference between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn753">150</xref></sup> thus they must instruct Israel concerning the impure and the pure so that they can be careful of them. It was for this reason that the communication about these laws came to both Moses and Aaron, or to Moses to say to Aaron, commanding both of them, <italic>speak unto the children of Israel</italic>, and this is the reason why these laws were said in the Book of the Laws of the Priests [i.e., this Book of Leviticus]. In this section He also warns against eating impure foods, so as not to defile the Tabernacle and its hallowed things.</p>
<p>2. AMONG ALL THE BEASTS THAT ARE ON THE EARTH. The plain meaning thereof is &#x201C;among all the beasts that are on &#x2018;the face of the earth,&#x201D; the expression being similar to &#x201C;all the beasts that are in the world.&#x201D; But the interpretation of the Rabbis is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn754">151</xref></sup> Since there are creatures in the sea whose law does not depend on these signs, but is like that of the fish, therefore He said, <italic>that are on the earth</italic>, excluding what is in the sea.</p>
<p>3. WHATSOEVER PARTETH THE HOOF, AND IS WHOLLY CLOVEN-FOOTED, AND CHEWETH THE CUD, AMONG THE BEASTS; THAT MAY YE EAT. The meaning of this verse is that every animal which has these two signs, you may eat, but you may not eat it if it has only one sign. Now it would have been proper if He would merely state the law in this general way. However, He singled out the camel, the rock-badger, and the hare<sup><xref rid="fn755">152</xref></sup> as having only the one sign of chewing the cud, and the swine as having the one sign of a parted hoof,<sup><xref rid="fn756">153</xref></sup> because there are no other animals in the world that have only one sign. He then repeated [as a general rule applying to those with no sign at all, and those with only one sign], <italic>Of their flesh ye shall not eat</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn757">154</xref></sup> which denotes a negative commandment.</p>
<p>Now Rashi wrote: &#x201C;From this verse I know only about these [four animals mentioned]. Whence do I know that other unclean animals that have no signs of purity, may not be eaten? You derive it by the rule of <italic>kal vachomer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn758">155</xref></sup> How is it with these four animals mentioned, that have some of the signs of purity? They are forbidden&#x0021; [It follows all the more so that those which have none of the signs, are surely forbidden to be eaten&#x0021;]&#x201D; In the words of the Sifra:<sup><xref rid="fn759">156</xref></sup> &#x201C;What is the law concerning those animals that have some of the signs of purity? They are forbidden to be eaten by a negative commandment. Is it not logical that other unclean animals which have none of the characteristics of purity, should be forbidden to be eaten by means of a negative commandment&#x0021; Thus we find that the camel, the rock-badger, the hare and the swine are explicitly forbidden by Scripture, whilst the other impure animals are forbidden on the strnegth of a <italic>kal vachomer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn758">155</xref></sup> It is also established that the positive commandment [regarding unclean animals] is Scriptural,<sup><xref rid="fn760">157</xref></sup> while the negative commandment regarding them is derived from a <italic>kal vachomer</italic>.&#x201D; Thus far is the text of the Beraitha.<sup><xref rid="fn759">156</xref></sup></p>
<p>But in my opinion this is not in accordance with the conclusion of the discussions in the Talmud. For if so, one would not be liable to whipping for eating of all the other unclean animals [which have <italic>none</italic> of the characteristics of purity], and which are forbidden only on the strength of a <italic>kal vachomer</italic>, for a law derived from logical argument is not one for which punishment can be administered.<sup><xref rid="fn761">158</xref></sup> Thus the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim<sup><xref rid="fn762">159</xref></sup> with respect to [having intercourse with] one&#x2019;s sister, which Scripture prohibited if she is <italic>the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn763">160</xref></sup> that it was necessary to find a Scriptural reference prohibiting one&#x2019;s sister if she be the daughter of both one&#x2019;s father and mother,<sup><xref rid="fn764">161</xref></sup> even though that prohibition might have been derived from a <italic>kal vachomer</italic>[for if the Torah prohibited a sister who is the daughter of either one&#x2019;s father or one&#x2019;s mother, surely she is prohibited] if she be the daughter of both one&#x2019;s father and mother&#x0021; [But the special Scriptural reference was necessary to teach us the principle] that a law derived from logical argument is not one for which punishment can be administered, as is stated in Tractate Yebamoth, Chapter <italic>Keitzad</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn765">162</xref></sup> But this Beraitha [quoted by Rashi] may either be in accordance with the opinion of the Sages who say that a law derived from a logical argument <italic>is</italic> one for which punishment can be administered, as stated in Tractate Sanhedrin,<sup><xref rid="fn766">163</xref></sup> or it cannot be satisfactorily explained.</p>
<p>Now the reason why whipping is [in fact] incurred for eating unclean beasts [which have none of the characteristics of purity, since they are only derived through a <italic>kal vachomer</italic>], is because Scripture states in connection with the rock-badger that it is prohibited because it <italic>parteth not the hoof</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn767">164</xref></sup> and in connection with the swine, because it <italic>cheweth not the cud</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn756">153</xref></sup> This being the case, any animal that does not chew the cud or have a parted hoof is included in the terms of this prohibition, and there is no need at all to derive them from a <italic>kal vachomer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn758">155</xref></sup></p>
<p>THESE MAY YE EAT. &#x201C;But not an unclean animal. Has it not already been forbidden by means of a negative commandment? But [this verse is stated] so that [if he eats of it] he transgresses both a positive and a negative commandment.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, and so it is found in the Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn768">165</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon] said<sup><xref rid="fn769">166</xref></sup> that this verse is in order to forbid human flesh &#x2013; &#x201C;<italic>these may ye eat</italic>, but not human flesh. Thus the flesh and the milk are forbidden by means of a positive commandment.&#x201D; But we have not found such an interpretation by our Rabbis. Perhaps he [Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon] thought this to be the case because of that which we have learned there in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn770">167</xref></sup> &#x201C;I might think that the flesh of those that walk on two legs and the milk of those that walk on two legs should also be forbidden to be eaten by means of a negative commandment? Therefore Scripture says: <italic>These ye shall not eat</italic> &#x2014; these are forbidden to be eaten by means of a negative commandment, but the flesh of those that walk on two legs and the milk of those that walk on two legs are not forbidden to be eaten by means of a negative commandment.&#x201D; From this text the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] may have deduced that they are not forbidden by means of a negative commandment, but are forbidden by means of a positive commandment, and he derived it from the verse: <italic>these may ye eat</italic>.</p>
<p>But the matter is not so. For our Rabbis have clearly said in connection with the blood of those that walk on two legs<sup><xref rid="fn771">168</xref></sup> and the milk of those that walk on two legs<sup><xref rid="fn772">169</xref></sup> that there is not even a commandment to abstain from eating them by Rabbinical enactment. If the flesh thereof would be prohibited [by Scriptural law], then [the blood and milk thereof would also be prohibited in accordance with the general rule]: &#x201C;anything that comes out of that which is impure, is also impure.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn773">170</xref></sup> The blood of crawling reptiles and that of human beings the Sages have excluded from the prohibition against blood, and they have said:<sup><xref rid="fn774">171</xref></sup> &#x201C;The blood of the crawling reptile is like its flesh, and one incurs whipping for eating a crawling reptile,&#x201D; meaning that it is <italic>not</italic> forbidden as blood [for the wanton violation of which one incurs excision]; thus they made it like flesh [but we find no such statement in connection with human blood]. Rather, when they said that there is no negative commandment against eating them, they meant to say that you cannot exclude them on the basis of it [i.e., on the basis of a <italic>specific</italic> Scriptural verse], and they are thus permitted. According to my opinion, however, this only applies to flesh [or blood] of a live person [which can not be prohibited on the basis of a definitive verse and hence if a person&#x2019;s teeth are bleeding he may suck the blood thereof and not be afraid of having committed a sin].<sup><xref rid="fn775">172</xref></sup> However, the Rabbis have learned in connection with a corpse by means of an analogous use of words found when speaking of it and of the heifer whose neck is broken<sup><xref rid="fn776">173</xref></sup> that it is forbidden to have any benefit from it.<sup><xref rid="fn777">174</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. &#x2018;V&#x2019;ETH HA&#x2019;ARNEVETH&#x2019; (AND THE HARE). This is a species of which both the male and female are so called in the Sacred Language, [although the word itself is feminine]. A similar case is <italic>haya&#x2019;anah</italic> (the ostrich)<sup><xref rid="fn778">175</xref></sup> [although the actual word is feminine in form, both male and female are indicated]. In fowls [a word of the same structure is] <italic>yonah</italic> (a pigeon), the name for the male not being different from that of the female. [On the other hand], there are many [animal species] the names of which are masculine in form, while their females have no specific name, such as <italic>gamal</italic> (camel), <italic>shafan</italic> (rock-badger), <italic>chazir</italic> (swine), <italic>&#x2018;dov oreiv&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a bear lying in wait</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn779">176</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;parah v&#x2019;dov tir&#x2019;enah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the cow and the bear shall feed</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn780">177</xref></sup> A similar case amongst fowls is the word <italic>tor</italic> (turtle-dove) [which, though masculine in form, denotes also the female]. It is for this reason that Scripture states, <italic>&#x2018;shtei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>two</italic>) <italic>turtle-doves, or &#x2018;shnei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>two</italic>) <italic>young pigeons</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn781">178</xref></sup> thus mentioning [the feminine form] <italic>shtei</italic> with reference to <italic>torim</italic> (turtle-doves) which is masculine in form, and [the masculine <italic>shnei</italic>] with reference to <italic>yonah</italic> (the young pigeon) [which is feminine in form], in order to inform us that there it does not matter which of them [one brings as an offering, whether male or female]. Do not refute me from the expressions of our Rabbis who say: &#x201C;cow and <italic>chazirah</italic> (sow);&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn782">179</xref></sup> &#x201C;a camel born of a <italic>gamlah</italic> (a she-camel),&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn783">180</xref></sup> for these are terms they improvised from similar forms in the language in order to make their intent clear. Now the reason why these four animals [the camel, rock-badger, hare, and swine] are forbidden [to be eaten] is that they do not have the two characteristics of purity.</p>
<p>8. AND THEIR CARCASSES YE SHALL NOT TOUCH. This is not a prohibition [saying that] we are not to touch these carcasses [of the animals that we are forbidden to eat]. Rather, Scripture states, <italic>and their carcasses ye shall not touch</italic>, for <italic>they are unclean to you</italic>, meaning to say, &#x201C;you cannot touch them without becoming unclean.&#x201D; The meaning thereof is to state that all those who touch them should be aware that they have become unclean and should therefore be careful not to enter the Sanctuary nor [to eat] of the hallowed offerings. Perhaps the meaning of the interpretation which our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn784">181</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And their carcasses ye shall not touch</italic> &#x2014; on a festival&#x201D; is to say that &#x201C;you should not touch them at a time when you want to be clean, for they are unclean [and by touching them you will also become unclean] and you will not be able to go up to the Sanctuary on the festival.&#x201D; But the [mere] act of touching them is not forbidden by means of a negative commandment, for he who touches carrion [even] on a festival does not incur whipping [by law of the Torah]. Thus that which the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn784">181</xref></sup> &#x201C;One is dutybound to purify oneself on a festival,&#x201D; is a commandment of Rabbinic authority, there being according to Scriptural law neither a positive nor a negative commandment, concerning the touching of carrion, except that of going up to the Sanctuary.<sup><xref rid="fn785">182</xref></sup> Or it may be that the interpretation,<sup><xref rid="fn784">181</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And their carcasses ye shall not touch</italic> &#x2014; on a festival,&#x201D; is a Scriptural text used as a support for the Rabbinical enactment,<sup><xref rid="fn683">80</xref></sup> like many other laws of the Sages taught there in the Torath Kohanim, which use Biblical texts as a &#x201C;support.&#x201D; It is also taught there:<sup><xref rid="fn786">183</xref></sup> &#x201C;Other Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn787">184</xref></sup> say: One might think that if a person touches a carcass [he violates a negative commandment and] is liable to whipping? Scripture therefore says, <italic>By these ye shall become unclean</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn788">185</xref></sup> From this one might think that if a person sees a carcass he must go and render himself unclean by [touching] it? Scripture therefore says, <italic>and their carcasses ye shall not touch</italic>. How are we to reconcile these two verses? We must conclude that [touching a carcass] is optional&#x201D; [i.e., neither obligatory, nor forbidden]. This is the main principle of the Scriptural law.</p>
<p>9. &#x2018;SNAPIR V&#x2019;KASKESES&#x2019; (FINS AND SCALES). &#x201C;<italic>Snapirim</italic> &#x2014; these are what [the fish] swim with. <italic>Kaskeses</italic> &#x2014; these are the scales attached to [the body of the fish].&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, and so also it is found in the Gemara of Tractate Chullin.<sup><xref rid="fn789">186</xref></sup> But you should not [be led to] understand from their language that these scales are really [inflexibly] fixed to their bodies and attached to the skin of the fish [so that they do not come off at all]. Rather, they are called &#x201C;fixed&#x201D; because they do not move to and fro from the fish, nor do they quiver as do the fins. They are the round coverings, the plates of which are like finger-nails, and they can be removed from the skin of the fish by hand or knife. But those [scales] which are fixed and attached to the skin of the fish and cannot be removed from the skin at all, are not <italic>kaskeses</italic> (scales), and the fish [which has them] is prohibited food. It is for this reason that the Sages in the Gemara<sup><xref rid="fn790">187</xref></sup> said that &#x201C;<italic>Kaskeses</italic> is the cover of the fish.&#x201D; In the words of the Tosephta:<sup><xref rid="fn791">188</xref></sup> &#x201C;The <italic>kaskasim</italic> are those [objects] which cover the fish, and the <italic>snapirim</italic> are those with which the fish moves.&#x201D; This is also the translation of Onkelos, who rendered the word <italic>kaskeses</italic> as <italic>klippin</italic>, [which means literally &#x201C;shells&#x201D;], for they are the &#x201C;shells&#x201D; of the fish which can be taken off and peeled away like the bark of trees and the peel of fruits. Such is also the meaning of the verse stating, <italic>and he</italic> [Goliath] <italic>was clad with a coat of &#x2018;kaskasim&#x2019;</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn792">189</xref></sup> for all their [war-] coats were made of rings, and some people made &#x201C;scales&#x201D; in them in order to close up the openings of the rings, so that thin arrows should not be able to penetrate them, and it was those &#x201C;scales&#x201D; that were called <italic>kaskasim</italic>. The Sages also mentioned them in the Gemara [Tractate Sanhedrin] in the Chapter <italic>Cheilek:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn793">190</xref></sup> &#x201C;Dressed in coats of mail made with scales.&#x201D; Now Jonathan the son of Uziel<sup><xref rid="fn794">191</xref></sup> translated [in the above-mentioned verse concerning Goliath that he was clad with] &#x201C;a coat of <italic>galbin</italic>,&#x201D; this being of the expression, <italic>the razor of &#x2018;hagalabim,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn795">192</xref></sup> which are &#x201C;leather workers.&#x201D; [By so translating, Jonathan thus] intended to say that the covering at the openings of the rings in this coat of mail was like that of the scales on a skin of a fish, as they used to boil hard skin and cover the coats of armor with them, a practice they do to this day. Understand this.</p>
<p>The reason why fins and scales [are signs of permissibility as food] is that those fish which have them always dwell in the upper clear waters, and they are sustained through the air that enters there. Therefore their bodies contain a certain amount of heat which counteracts the abundance of moistness [of the waters], just as wool, hair and nails function in man and beast. Those fish which have no fins and scales always dwell in the lower turbid waters, and due to the great abundance of moistness and gatherings of water there, they cannot repel anything. Hence they are creatures of cold fluid,<sup><xref rid="fn796">193</xref></sup> which cleaves to them and is therefore more easily able to cause death, and it [the cold fluid] does in fact cause death in some waters, such as stagnant lakes.</p>
<p>10. OF ALL THAT SWARM (&#x2018;SHERETZ&#x2019;) IN THE WATERS, AND OF ALL THE LIVING CREATURES THAT ARE IN THE WATERS. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that <italic>sheretz</italic> (&#x201C;swarming&#x201D; things) are the small species that are born [and bred] in the waters, while &#x201C;the living creatures&#x201D; are the species of male and female. But in my opinion the term <italic>&#x2018;sheretz&#x2019; that swarm in the waters</italic> denotes the fish which swim in the waters, for every expression of <italic>sheretz</italic> means movement, and the term <italic>all the living creatures that are in the waters</italic>, refers to the sea-animals, some of which have legs which they walk upon like creatures of the field. Thus there is one law alike for all of them [namely that those which do not have fins and scales are forbidden to be eaten]. The interpretation of the Torath Kohanim is:<sup><xref rid="fn797">194</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Living</italic>, this denotes the sea-animal. <italic>Creature</italic>, this includes the siren. I might think that its carcass conveys impurity in a tent [like that of a human body], as Ben Chachinai indeed says? Scripture therefore says [in the verse before us], <italic>they are detestable</italic>&#x201D; [as food, but they do not convey impurity to a person who comes into the tent where their carcass lies].<sup><xref rid="fn798">195</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND THEIR CARCASSES YE SHALL HAVE IN DETESTATION. &#x201C;This includes [in the category of forbidden food] <italic>yavchushin</italic> which have been filtered [through water]. <italic>Yavchushin</italic> are insects called <italic>mousclions</italic><sup><xref rid="fn799">196</xref></sup> in [old] French.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>But I wonder about it&#x0021; For this species [of <italic>mousclions</italic>] always comes out of wine, and flies about in the air and rests on the earth, and even while still in the air [before creeping upon the earth] it is already forbidden [as food], as we say [in Tractate Chullin] in the Chapter <italic>Eilu Treifoth:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn800">197</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rav Yoseif raised the question: [if an insect which grew in a fruit] flew off into the air [and before it rested on the earth, was swallowed knowingly by a person] what is the law regarding it?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn801">198</xref></sup> How much more so that it is forbidden when it rests continually all day upon vessels and upon the earth far away from the wine cellar, for it is already called <italic>a swarming thing that swarmeth upon the earth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn802">199</xref></sup> Rather, that species [mentioned by Rashi as <italic>mousclions</italic>] is called <italic>yitush</italic> (mosquito) &#x2014; and breeds in wine, as the Rabbis have said in the tradition concerning the wicked Titus,<sup><xref rid="fn803">200</xref></sup> [and is not the <italic>yavchushin</italic> of our verse]. But the <italic>yavchushim</italic> which are mentioned here [by Rashi, on the basis of the Torath Kohanim] is a species which is concealed in water, and one searches for it with a ladle and removes it, [the term <italic>yavchushim</italic> being] of the expression:<sup><xref rid="fn804">201</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Ein bochashin</italic> (one may not stir) a drink prepared of flour mixed with honey on the Sabbath.&#x201D; And in the Gemara of Tractate Zebachim, in the second chapter, [Resh Lakesh] said:<sup><xref rid="fn805">202</xref></sup> &#x201C;All things which serve to fill up the required measure of an immersion-pool, may also serve to fill up the water in the laver [from which the priests washed their hands and feet before ministering in the Sanctuary];<sup><xref rid="fn806">203</xref></sup> but they do not serve to fill up the required measure of one fourth of a log of water [for the washing of hands].&#x201D; On this [saying of Resh Lakesh] the Rabbis asked: &#x201C;[What did Resh Lakesh mean to exclude by saying that &#x2018;they&#x2019; do not fill up the required measure of water for the washing of hands]? Shall we say that he meant to exclude red <italic>yavchushim</italic>? In that case even if the immersion-pool is full of them, it is also valid&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn807">204</xref></sup> For we are taught [in a Beraitha]: Rabban<sup><xref rid="fn808">205</xref></sup> Shimon the son of Gamaliel says: Whatever originates from water, one may immerse oneself therein [to be rendered ritually pure],&#x201D; and red <italic>yavchushim</italic> is a species which originates from water [therefore Resh Lakesh could not have intended them, when he gave his rule excluding certain objects from being valid for <italic>completing</italic> the required measure of one fourth of a log for the washing of hands].<sup><xref rid="fn809">206</xref></sup> Similarly there are always found in the sediment of wine very white worms which are formed from the thickness of the wine, and which people filter, [and these are akin to the <italic>mousclions</italic> mentioned by Rashi].</p>
<p>Now I have seen in Rashi&#x2019;s commentaries there [in Tractate Zebachim]<sup><xref rid="fn805">202</xref></sup> that he wrote: &#x201C;Red <italic>yavchushim</italic>, these are a sort of wingless <italic>yitushim</italic> (mosquitoes) just like the small <italic>yavchushim</italic> which germinate at the bottom of our barrels of wine on the outside; and they are also formed in water.&#x201D; Perhaps it is this wingless species [of insects] which can only be removed from water through a filtering process, that Rashi refers to here [in his commentary to the Torah, when referring to <italic>yavchushim</italic> as <italic>mousclions</italic>], since in his vernacular these water-insects were also called by that name [not only the ones produced in wine]. However, in his commentary to Tractate Chullin<sup><xref rid="fn810">207</xref></sup> Rashi wrote: &#x2018;<italic>Yavchushim</italic>, these are like small <italic>yitushim</italic> (mosquitoes) found in wine-cellars,&#x201D; [and he mentioned nothing concerning the <italic>yavchushim</italic> which are created in water; hence in his commentary here on the Torah, Rashi, in speaking of <italic>yavchushim</italic>, must be referring to that kind of insect which germinates in wine; if so, his explanation is refuted by the Rabbinic sources quoted above which show that <italic>yavchushim</italic> germinate in water]&#x0021; The principle of the matter is that these <italic>yavchushim</italic> are a species that does not swarm upon the earth at all [and therefore is not included in the negative commandment mentioned further on in Verse 41, but is forbidden separately under the terms of the verse here dealt with].</p>
<p>13. AND THESE YE SHALL HAVE IN DETESTATION AMONG THE FOWLS. Of all fowls [existent], only those mentioned expressly in this section and their species &#x2014; such as those concerning which it says, <italic>after his kind</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn811">208</xref></sup> or <italic>after her kind</italic><sup><xref rid="fn812">209</xref></sup> &#x2014; are prohibited, since Scripture did not mention any signs of unclean birds [by which we may know that they are] forbidden, or of clean birds [by which we may know that they are] permitted. Instead, it said, <italic>And these ye shall have in detestation among the fowls</italic> &#x2014; [so that only those specifically mentioned are prohibited], and no others apart from these. Similarly, in connection with the swarming things which convey impurity, which Scripture mentioned in detail,<sup><xref rid="fn813">210</xref></sup> only those mentioned by name in the section are included in that law. Our Rabbis, however, have specified certain signs [of impurity as food] in birds, so that one may recognize through them that the fowls which lack those signs are not amongst those which are prohibited [here].</p>
<p>Now the most important sign [of unfitness as food] in fowls is preying, for every bird of prey<sup><xref rid="fn814">211</xref></sup> is invariably unfit [as food]. The Torah removed it [from us] as food, because its blood becomes heated up due to its cruelty, and is dark and thick, which gives rise to that bitter [fluid in the body] which is mostly black<sup><xref rid="fn815">212</xref></sup> and tends to make the heart cruel. There is not another fowl in the whole world that is a bird of prey apart from those mentioned in this section,<sup><xref rid="fn816">213</xref></sup> and therefore one may know that any fowl which is a bird of prey, is one of those mentioned here. Thus if it is known for sure that it does not prey, it may definitely be eaten, for amongst all the forbidden fowls, there is only one which does not prey, namely the bearded vulture or the osprey, and the Sages were not concerned about it [being eaten because of reliance on the fact that it does not prey], since it is not found in habitated places, but dwells always in wilderness. Perhaps it is because it dwells in wastelands and its blood is affected for the worse by the burning heat, like that of the birds of prey, that the Torah prohibited it as food together with them.</p>
<p>The Sages furthermore counted<sup><xref rid="fn789">186</xref></sup> amongst the signs [of fitness as food] that if a fowl be found which has an &#x201C;extra&#x201D; toe, and its crop and gizzard can be peeled, it is definitely fit [to be eaten], for the Sages knew that such a bird does not prey. But if it has only two of the three signs mentioned, we may not eat it; for the raven [which is a bird unfit as food, as stated in Verse 15], has an extra toe and a gizzard that can be peeled, and [therefore any bird that has only two signs of fitness] we suspect of being a raven or of its species, since they all have two tokens. It does not need to be said that if it has only one of the three signs mentioned we treat it as forbidden, for all the other forbidden fowls have one sign, except for the great vulture which has none of these three signs. Now the meaning of the term &#x201C;preying&#x201D; is that in hunting for food it chases after birds, catches them alive, presses on them with its claws and eats them, just as is done by the great hawk called <italic>astur</italic>, and the little hawk called <italic>ashproir</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn817">214</xref></sup> and in Arabic, <italic>butz</italic>. The above is the correct law of birds, as to which are forbidden food and which are permitted, and that which is the final result of the [discussions in the] Gemara, and is in accordance with that which we have searched and found to be so through the examination of birds.<sup><xref rid="fn818">215</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus the reason for certain birds being forbidden as food is on account of their cruel nature. It is also possible that the reason for certain animals [being forbidden] is similar, since no animal that chews the cud and has a parted hoof is a beast of prey, while the rest all devour others. There has also been found a difference in nature [between animals fit for food and those which are unfit], as the Sages have mentioned,<sup><xref rid="fn819">216</xref></sup> namely that all milks of animals fit for food, curdle, whereas all milks of those unfit for food, do not coagulate and cannot ever be made into cheese. Thus they are [physically] different. It is possible to say on the basis of this [difference in their natures, that those animals unfit for food] harm the procreative organs, so that the seed which gathers from their moisture is cold and extra-moist and will not beget at all, or not in the best and proper way, apart from the fact that there is a certain known benefit according to medical sciences [in eating those] animals that are permitted [by the Torah] as food. Now I have seen in some books of experiments<sup><xref rid="fn820">217</xref></sup> that if an infant drinks of the milk of a swine, that child will become a leper. This is a sign that there are very bad features to all unclean animals.</p>
<p>20. &#x2018;SHERETZ HA&#x2019;OPH&#x2019; (WINGED SWARMING THINGS). &#x201C;These are the thin, lowly creatures which crawl upon the ground, such as flies and hornets, mosquitoes and grasshoppers.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But I do not consider it to be correct, for a bird is not called <italic>sheretz</italic> (a swarming thing) on account of its smallness, nor is the unqualified term <italic>oph</italic> (bird) used because of the largeness of its body. The bat has very small legs, and many kinds of grasshoppers have larger ones than it, so why is the bat not called <italic>sheretz ha&#x2019;oph</italic> (a winged swarming thing) like the grasshoppers?<sup><xref rid="fn821">218</xref></sup> Rather, the meaning of <italic>sheretz ha&#x2019;oph</italic> is written [in Scripture immediately] after it: <italic>that go upon all fours</italic>. For all fowls that walk upon two legs, have erect necks, and their heads face upwards, and they always depend on their wings and flap them; therefore they are called <italic>oph kanaph</italic> (winged fowl),<sup><xref rid="fn822">219</xref></sup> or just <italic>oph</italic>. But those that have [four] legs walk lowly, with their neck and head bent downwards like creeping things, and therefore they are called <italic>sheretz ha&#x2019;oph</italic> (a winged creeping thing), as I have explained in <italic>Seder Bereshith</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn811">208</xref></sup> Similarly He referred back here and explained, <italic>And all &#x2018;sheretz ha&#x2019;oph&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>winged creeping things</italic>) <italic>which have four feet, are a detestable thing unto you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn823">220</xref></sup> the meaning thereof being as if He had said: &#x201C;<italic>all winged creeping things which have</italic> only <italic>four feet</italic> and do not have jointed legs [above their feet] as mentioned [in Verse 21 amongst the signs of purity], <italic>are a detestable thing unto you</italic>.&#x201D; The interpretation thereof in Torath Kohanim is:<sup><xref rid="fn824">221</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi<sup><xref rid="fn825">222</xref></sup> says: <italic>And all &#x2018;sheretz ha&#x2019;oph&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>winged creeping things</italic>) <italic>which have four feet, are a detestable thing</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn823">220</xref></sup> But if it has five feet, it is a clean species.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now in this section regarding winged creeping things there is only a positive commandment,<sup><xref rid="fn826">223</xref></sup> but in the Book of Deuteronomy there is a prohibition mentioned in connection with it, [namely], <italic>And all &#x2018;sheretz ha&#x2019;oph&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>winged creeping things</italic>) <italic>are unclean unto you; they shall not be eaten</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn827">224</xref></sup> It is on the basis of that verse there that whipping is incurred for violation thereof.</p>
<p>24. AND BY THESE YE SHALL BECOME UNCLEAN. &#x201C;<italic>By these</italic> which are to be mentioned further on in the section, <italic>ye shall become unclean</italic>. Here<sup><xref rid="fn828">225</xref></sup> Scripture teaches you that the carcass of an animal <italic>unfit</italic> for food conveys impurity, and in the subject at the end of the section<sup><xref rid="fn829">226</xref></sup> it explains [the law] concerning the carcass of an animal <italic>fit</italic> for food.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But if so, [the question arises], why did Scripture divide them and why did it treat them singly,<sup><xref rid="fn830">227</xref></sup> when it should rather have said [in one general statement], &#x201C;whosoever touches the carcass of any animal shall be unclean until the evening, and whosoever carries any of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening?&#x201D;</p>
<p>The correct interpretation is that here Scripture mentioned <italic>the carcass of them</italic> without qualification and did not mention &#x201C;death&#x201D; in connection with them, thus teaching that [the law of] ritual slaughtering [required to render animals fit for food] does not apply to them [the unclean animals mentioned here], and whoever touches them when they are no longer alive [whether they died by themselves or even if they were ritually slaughtered], becomes impure. But further on it states, <italic>And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn831">228</xref></sup> thus teaching that if it [an animal fit for food] was ritually slaughtered, it does not convey impurity [to a person who touches it]. Now the meaning of the section in mentioning [here]: <italic>And by these ye shall become unclean</italic>, is to state that all things referred to above &#x2014; namely, fishes, fowls, and grasshoppers &#x2014; do not have this [law of] impurity, but only those which He is about to mention further on, these being <italic>Every beast &#x2026; which is not cloven-footed, nor cheweth the cud</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn832">229</xref></sup> It is with reference to these that He states, <italic>they are unclean to you; every one that toucheth them shall be unclean</italic><sup><xref rid="fn832">229</xref></sup> with the uncleanness mentioned [in the preceding Verses 24-25: <italic>whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even. And whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even</italic>]. Then He continues by stating that any beast which walks upon its paws shall also convey impurity until the evening to a person who touches its carcass, and that a person who <italic>carries</italic> it shall, in addition, wash his clothes.<sup><xref rid="fn833">230</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>And these are they which are unclean unto you among the swarming things</italic><sup><xref rid="fn834">231</xref></sup> means among those which are to be mentioned further on.<sup><xref rid="fn835">232</xref></sup> Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra erred here.<sup><xref rid="fn836">233</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now above, in stating the prohibition of eating [an animal prohibited as food], Scripture mentioned those animals which are not cloven-footed and do not chew the cud, but it did not mention [the law] of beasts that walk upon their paws. Perhaps it is because it is not customary to eat them [on account of the danger involved in catching them] that He did not single them out, but left them [to be] included in the general principle which He had stated, that we should eat only the animal that parts the hoof and is cloven-footed and chews the cud, and not others, and <italic>chayah</italic> (beast) is included in the term <italic>beheimah</italic> (animal) as it is said, <italic>These are &#x2018;ha&#x2019;beheimah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the animals</italic>) <italic>which ye may eat &#x2026; the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn837">234</xref></sup> Our Rabbis in the Torath Kohanim have interpretations on this whole section. [Thus they explain the expression], <italic>Every beast</italic> [<italic>which parteth the hoof, but is not cloven-footed &#x2026;</italic>] <italic>is unclean to you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn832">229</xref></sup> to include a limb cut off from a living animal [in the law of conveying impurity].<sup><xref rid="fn838">235</xref></sup> <italic>And whatsoever goeth upon its paws</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn833">230</xref></sup> to include a limb cut off from a dead animal [in the law of conveying impurity]. For Scripture speaks at length and mentions many expressions of impurity in order to allude [to the law] that they convey impurity in whole or in part, either through the death of the whole body or through the death of one of its limbs, as when it was cut off from a living body.</p>
<p>HE SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN. The meaning of this expression in the whole section is that at night he becomes pure, if he had bathed his flesh in water [before sundown]. Scripture, however, speaks briefly [and therefore omitted] the bathing of the body, because it mentioned the washing of clothes of the one who <italic>carries</italic> anything unclean,<sup><xref rid="fn839">236</xref></sup> which means their immersion [in a ritual pool], and it follows all the more so that he must bathe his body. Then when Scripture finished mentioning all the impurities [conveyed by] carcasses and [dead] creeping things, it mentioned immersion [for those vessels which became impure through touching them]: <italic>it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn840">237</xref></sup> the same law applying to man, for it is from here that the principle is derived. In another section He explained, <italic>And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be home-born or a stranger, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn841">238</xref></sup> and He mentioned also the punishment for the violation thereof, <italic>But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn842">239</xref></sup> This is a general principle of all impurities [conveyed by] carrion, and from it the law is derived for [impurities conveyed by] creeping things. The matter of bathing [in the case of impurity conveyed by] creeping things has already been mentioned here, as I have written. Now Scripture was more severe in the case of a person who carries an impure object than in the case of a person who touches it, in requiring the bearer to wash his clothes, [but not one who only touches it], because it is natural that a person who touches does so with his hand lightly, while he who carries as a burden [does so in such a way] that it presses upon him, and in the majority of cases his clothes help him [in carrying].</p>
<p>32. AND EVERY THING UPON WHICH ANY PART OF THEM, WHEN THEY ARE DEAD, DOTH FALL, SHALL BE UNCLEAN: WHETHER IT SHALL BE ANY VESSEL OF WOOD etc. It appears to me in the interpretation of this verse that most likely the expression <italic>any of them, when they are dead</italic>, alludes to all those mentioned above &#x2014; impure animals, creeping things, and beasts. For why should He mention the law of impurity of vessels and garments only with reference to creeping things, when it applies also to carcasses? Similarly, all the rules that He mentions with reference to making food susceptible to impurity<sup><xref rid="fn843">240</xref></sup> [conveyed by creeping things], apply equally to all [forms of] impurity, and Scripture speaks of the general concept of them. Do not find it difficult to accept that the expression <italic>touch them when they are dead</italic> in the first verse<sup><xref rid="fn844">241</xref></sup> applies to the creeping things, while the same expression <italic>any of them when they are dead</italic> [in Verse 32 before us] applies to <italic>all</italic> things that convey impurity, for such is the case in many places in Scripture [where similar words apply to different things].</p>
<p>It is possible to say that Scripture waited until it had mentioned all impure things amongst cattle, beasts, and creeping things, and then at the end mentioned impurity of vessels with reference to one of them [namely, the creeping things], with which it had concluded this theme, in order that the law of all the others be derived from it, for the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn845">242</xref></sup> is that the expression <italic>any of them when they are dead</italic> [in Verse 32 before us] refers [only] to creeping things, and from that they learn that a creeping thing in [a minimal] size of a lentil conveys impurity.<sup><xref rid="fn846">243</xref></sup> Scripture dealt likewise with the subject of immersion, in mentioning at the end of all [the laws of] impurity, the impurity [conveyed by creeping things] to vessels and their purification by immersion,<sup><xref rid="fn847">244</xref></sup> and from it we learn the law of man and vessels with reference to all the impurities mentioned above.</p>
<p>IT MUST BE PUT INTO WATER, AND IT SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN; AND IT SHALL BE CLEAN. &#x201C;Even after it has been immersed, it is still impure with regard to the heave-offering, until the setting of the sun, and afterwards at the setting of the sun it becomes pure.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And the interpretation in the Torath Kohanim is:<sup><xref rid="fn848">245</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And it shall be unclean until the even</italic>. I might think that [it shall be impure] for all [purposes]; Scripture therefore says, <italic>and it shall be clean</italic>. But if so, I might think that it is pure for all purposes; Scripture therefore says, <italic>and it shall be unclean until the even</italic>. How then can this be explained? It is pure with respect to ordinary food<sup><xref rid="fn849">246</xref></sup> when it is still daytime [immediately after it was immersed to be purified], but regarding the heave-offering it is not held to be pure until it becomes dark.&#x201D; The interpretation of the verse according to the explanation of the Torath Kohanim is thus: &#x201C;it must be put into the water [before sundown] and it shall remain unclean till the evening.&#x201D; But by way of the simple meaning of Scripture [the verse is to be transposed, thus]: &#x201C;it must be put into water and it shall be clean, but it shall be unclean until the evening.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now Scripture mentioned in all the sections [that the impurity is] &#x201C;until the evening,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn850">247</xref></sup> because it refers to the degree of purity required for the holy heave-offering, as He said, <italic>The soul that toucheth any such</italic> [unclean things] <italic>shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water. And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because it is his bread</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn851">248</xref></sup> But the purification required for ordinary food or the [Second] Tithe<sup><xref rid="fn852">249</xref></sup> is attained after immersion alone, and it is not mentioned here because it is not mandatory upon an impure person to purify himself in order to eat ordinary food,<sup><xref rid="fn853">250</xref></sup> for if he wants to, he may eat it in a state of impurity.<sup><xref rid="fn854">251</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. OF ALL THE FOOD WHICH MAY BE EATEN, THAT ON WHICH WATER COMETH, SHALL BE UNCLEAN. Rashi commented: &#x201C;This verse according to its [Rabbinical] interpretations teaches many things. We learn that food does not become fit to be susceptible of impurity until water has once come upon it, and once water has come upon it, it can subsequently at any time become impure, even after it has become dry, etc. Our Rabbis have further learned from this verse that &#x2018;a secondary impurity&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn855">252</xref></sup> does not render vessels impure, for so we are taught etc. Again we learn that the coming of water upon vegetation makes it susceptible to impurity only after it has been plucked from the soil etc.&#x201D; And included among the principles [we learn from this verse], Rashi said: &#x201C;And we further learn that impure foodstuff does not convey impurity to other objects unless it [the former] consists of at least the size of an egg, for it says, <italic>of all the food which may be eaten</italic>, which means food which can be eaten in one gulp, and the Sages calculated that the esophagus does not hold more than a hen&#x2019;s egg.&#x201D; This is the language of the Rabbi [Rashi.].</p>
<p>But there is [too great a] brevity in Rashi&#x2019;s comment. For this verse speaks about foodstuff itself becoming impure, and does not refer to its <italic>conveying</italic> impurity to others. The Rabbi [Rashi], however, derived this principle from what the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn856">253</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Of all the food</italic> etc. <italic>shall be unclean</italic>. This teaches that food [upon which a dead creeping thing falls], is rendered impure even if it be of the smallest quantity. Now I might think that it can also <italic>convey</italic> impurity to other objects if the [original] impure food was of the smallest quantity; Scripture therefore says, <italic>which may be eaten</italic>. Thus you learn that it cannot render other things impure unless it is itself the size of an egg.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn857">254</xref></sup> But other authorities have already differed<sup><xref rid="fn858">255</xref></sup> with the Rabbi [Rashi], and they brought proofs that by Scriptural law foodstuffs do not [even] <italic>become</italic> impure at all unless they are of the size of an egg. Thus the interpretation of the Torath Kohanim [mentioned above] is merely a Scriptural support for a Rabbinic law,<sup><xref rid="fn683">80</xref></sup> the Rabbis having added [the stricture] that foodstuffs of even the smallest size also <italic>become</italic> impure [although they cannot convey impurity to others unless they themselves are the size of an egg]. The main interpretation of the verse is as the Rabbis have said there [in the Torath Kohanim]:<sup><xref rid="fn856">253</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>The food</italic>. This is to exclude food for cattle [that it is not susceptible to impurity]. <italic>Of all the food</italic> &#x2014; this is to include food for cattle which one intended to use for human consumption. <italic>Which may be eaten</italic>, excepting decomposed foods.&#x201D;</p>
<p>35. AND EVERYTHING WHEREUPON ANY PART OF THEIR CARCASS FALLETH SHALL BE UNCLEAN; WHETHER OVEN, OR RANGE FOR POTS, &#x2018;YUTATZ&#x2019; (IT SHALL BE BROKEN DOWN). Scripture teaches you here that the law of the oven and range for pots which are made of clay &#x2014; in which fire is kindled and bread baked &#x2014; is, [although they are] attached to the ground, like the law of earthenware pottery such as pots and jugs, which are burnt in a furnace and are movable objects, in that they too [oven and ranges], can become impure, and cannot [thereafter] be purified in an immersion-pool [in the same way that movable pottery cannot be purified].<sup><xref rid="fn858">255</xref></sup> Scripture states <italic>&#x2018;yutatz&#x2019;</italic> (it shall be broken down) and does not say <italic>yishaber</italic> [&#x201C;it shall be broken in pieces&#x201D; &#x2014; as it says in speaking of movable earthenware which has become impure,]<sup><xref rid="fn859">256</xref></sup> in order to teach that the oven and range need not be broken <italic>so that there shall not be found among the pieces thereof a shard to take fire from the hearth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn860">257</xref></sup> but instead they should be destroyed to the extent that they should no longer be capable of serving their [original] purpose. [The word <italic>&#x2018;yutatz&#x2019;</italic> is] further used to teach that they become impure even though they are attached to the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn861">258</xref></sup> and [the owner] must break down what he built, for the meaning of the term <italic>nethitzah</italic> is the breaking down of something built, such as the expressions: <italic>&#x2018;vatitzu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and ye broke down</italic>)<italic>the houses;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn862">259</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;nathatz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and he shall pull down</italic>) <italic>the house</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn863">260</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. NEVERTHELESS A FOUNTAIN OR A CISTERN WHEREIN IS A GATHERING OF WATER SHALL BE CLEAN. Scripture is stating that the waters in the immersion-pool whilst attached to the ground are not susceptible to impurity if any [source of] impurity should fall therein. BUT THAT WHICH TOUCHETH THEIR CARCASS SHALL BE UNCLEAN. The meaning thereof is as follows: &#x201C;but waters which touch the carcass [of any of the creeping things] shall become impure, [meaning that waters which are <italic>separated</italic> [from a gathering of water] are rendered impure if they touch their carcass. [The phrase, <italic>and</italic> [<italic>waters</italic>] <italic>which touch their carcass shall be unclean</italic>, must be referring to detached waters], for when the waters are still attached to the pool, they cannot [be said to] &#x2018;touch&#x2019; their carcass, but rather [Scripture should have said], their carcass &#x2018;fell&#x2019; into it.&#x201D; Scripture speaks of water in the singular [saying, <italic>v&#x2019;nogeia</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;and that which toucheth&#x201D;], just as it says elsewhere, <italic>the water of sprinkling was not sprinkled upon him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn864">261</xref></sup> Or it may be that Scripture is saying, &#x201C;and whatsoever touches their carcass shall be impure,&#x201D; and the intent is to include water and [the other] drinks mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn865">262</xref></sup> In general, this verse comes to teach that water is susceptible to impurity when it is detached [from a pool], but not when it is attached thereto, a principle that has not been mentioned heretofore.</p>
<p>Now in the Torath Kohanim we find that [the Rabbis gave this interpretation]:<sup><xref rid="fn866">263</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Yosei the Galilean<sup><xref rid="fn867">264</xref></sup> said: <italic>But that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean</italic>. By touching they [i.e., the eight dead creeping things] convey impurity, but not by carrying them.&#x201D; This too is feasible, that [the verse] is referring back to all the laws mentioned [in Verses 24-5] previously, and saying that creeping things convey impurity only by touch. Our Rabbis have further interpretations of the redundant expressions in this [whole] verse, all of them laws given to Moses on Sinai.</p>
<p>Now Scripture mentioned the purity of the immersion-pool and waters attached to the ground in speaking of [the impurity conveyed by] creeping things, but the same law applies to [that conveyed by] carrion [of animals forbidden as food, and of those permitted animals not slaughtered properly or which died by themselves]. It waited, however, to mention [the law concerning the purity of pools till now], until it had completed the enumeration of all objects that convey impurity. Or it may be that it is because creeping things frequently die in fountains or in cisterns. I have already mentioned my opinion<sup><xref rid="fn868">265</xref></sup> [that this verse mentions the impurity of vessels conveyed by creeping things and their purification by immersion, and from it we learn the law of people and vessels in connection with the other forms of impurity mentioned above].</p>
<p>37. &#x2018;ZERA ZEIRUA&#x2019; (SEED OF SOWING). &#x201C;<italic>Zera</italic> means &#x2018;seed&#x2019; of any kind of seed-plant. <italic>Zeirua</italic> is the noun (&#x2018;sowing,&#x2019; &#x2018;thing sown&#x2019;), like the expression, <italic>and let them give us &#x2018;zeiro&#x2019;im&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>edible seeds</italic>) <italic>to eat</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn869">266</xref></sup> [<italic>And if aught of their carcass fall upon any seed of sowing which is to be sown</italic>] <italic>it is clean</italic>. This is to teach you that food is not fit and susceptible of becoming impure until water has once come upon it.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>Now Scripture mentioned above, <italic>of all the food which may be eaten, that on which water cometh</italic> [<italic>shall be unclean</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn870">267</xref></sup> establishing the principle that foodstuff must first become susceptible to impurity [through coming into contact with water]. But there the Rabbis interpreted it to mean<sup><xref rid="fn871">268</xref></sup> the foodstuff is not rendered impure through the medium of the interior of an [impure] earthen vessel, unless it was made susceptible of receiving impurity by being moistened by water. But here Scripture added that even from [contact with] the creeping things themselves, foodstuff does not become impure unless it was made susceptible [by water]. So it is explained in the Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn872">269</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also possible to say that the expression <italic>of all the food which may be eaten</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn870">267</xref></sup> refers to the things mentioned above &#x2014; meat and various foods. But here He states that even seeds when taken out to be sown, can be rendered impure if they have become susceptible to impurity by being moistened by water. The reason for foodstuffs having to be made susceptible by water [before they can become impure], is that the uncleanness of [dead] creeping things and the other sources of impurity, attaches to foodstuffs in their state of moisteness, but not when they are dry. The Torah then, as an extra precautionary measure, declared impure those foods on which water had once come, although they have [subsequently] become dry, [if they were then touched by any of the sources of impurity], in order that the rule should not vary according to different standards. Now the law of making food susceptible of becoming impure applies also to the impurity [conveyed] by carrion, Scripture having mentioned it here for the reason we have stated above.<sup><xref rid="fn873">270</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. AND HE THAT EATETH OF THE CARCASS OF IT SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES, AND BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN. In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, the verse speaks here of one who eats in the way that people usually eat, namely, that he touches and carries what he eats, and therefore becomes impure by contact and by carrying. It was necessary to mention this case so that it should not occur to anyone that because of eating, his degree of impurity should be greater [than that resulting merely from contact and carrying]. It mentioned this law in regard to an animal fit for food [as mentioned in the preceding Verse 39], because a person can [easily] err with regard to it, thinking that it was slaughtered properly [and he will therefore eat it], but such errors do not normally occur with regard to forbidden animals, and the way of the Torah is to speak of what usually happens. But according to its [Rabbinic] interpretation,<sup><xref rid="fn874">271</xref></sup> the verse comes to prescribe the [minimum] size required to become impure through carrying or touching, namely an amount that can be called &#x201C;eating,&#x201D; which is the size of an olive and Scripture also mentioned this law in regard to carrion of an animal fit for food, whilst the same law applies to an animal not permitted as food, because He finished here the law of impurities.<sup><xref rid="fn875">272</xref></sup> According to the opinion of the interpretation of the Torath Kohanim,<sup><xref rid="fn876">273</xref></sup> all impurities [conveyed] by carrion [of animals fit for food and those which are unfit animals] are included here, and the section above<sup><xref rid="fn877">274</xref></sup> refers to limbs of animals. I have already mentioned this.<sup><xref rid="fn878">275</xref></sup></p>
<p>41. AND EVERY CREEPING THING THAT CREEPETH UPON THE EARTH IS A DETESTABLE THING; IT SHALL NOT BE EATEN. The meaning of this verse is as follows: He mentioned above the [eight] creeping things<sup><xref rid="fn879">276</xref></sup> in connection with impurity [conveyed through contact when they are dead], and expressly mentioned those that are impure, but did not speak at all of the prohibition of eating. It is for this reason that He now says, <italic>And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten</italic>, meaning to say that as far as eating is concerned, there is no difference between them, for they are all forbidden. Then He spoke of them again in detail [in the following verses], and increased the negative commandments about them, [in order to increase the liability] to whipping, just as Rashi mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn880">277</xref></sup></p>
<p>47. TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE UNCLEAN AND THE CLEAN. This means that we should distinguish between all things mentioned above, between the unclean and the clean, with regard to impurity[through contact]. AND BETWEEN THE ANIMAL THAT MAY BE EATEN. This is connected with the word &#x201C;soul&#x201D; mentioned [in the preceding verse], thus meaning: &#x201C;and between the living animal that may be eaten.&#x201D; Scripture is thus stating that we should distinguish as far as eating is concerned, between the living animal that may be eaten according to the Torah <italic>in the waters</italic> and <italic>upon the earth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn881">278</xref></sup> and the animal in them that may not be eaten. In the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis said:<sup><xref rid="fn882">279</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And &#x2018;hachayah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the beast</italic>) <italic>that may not be eaten</italic>. The Sages say, this establishes a prohibition against eating a [forbidden type of] beast.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn883">280</xref></sup> If so, there is a special negative commandment regarding it.</p>
<p>Now Rashi wrote: &#x201C;<italic>To make a distinction between the unclean and the clean</italic>. Is it necessary to tell us to distinguish between the cow and the ass? Have they not clearly been defined already [by distinguishing signs]? But the meaning is: [to make a distinction between] that which is forbidden <italic>for you</italic> and that which is permitted <italic>for you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn884">281</xref></sup> between the case of an animal of which <italic>only half</italic> of the windpipe was cut, [in which case, even if he cut through the whole gullet, it may not be eaten], and the case of an animal of which the <italic>greater part</italic> of the windpipe [or the entire windpipe] was cut through, [in addition to the gullet, or the greater part of it being cut through, which is permitted to be eaten].&#x201D; There [in Tractate Chullin]<sup><xref rid="fn885">282</xref></sup> it is taught: &#x201C;And how much is there between half and the greater part of it? As much as a hair&#x2019;s breadth,&#x201D; [and it is this which requires <italic>&#x2018;making a distinction&#x2019;</italic>]. Do not be disturbed here because of that which they said there in the Gemara<sup><xref rid="fn885">282</xref></sup> that it must be &#x201C;a greater part which is apparent to the eyes&#x201D; [thus a mere hair&#x2019;s breadth would not be sufficient], for the meaning of that was only in order to exclude the opinion of the Sage<sup><xref rid="fn886">283</xref></sup> who says that half and half is treated as if the majority [was cut through]; therefore they said that the part cut through must actually be a greater part, which is apparent to the eyes, not a half which we only <italic>treat</italic> in our minds [as the greater part], and we say that &#x201C;the greater part&#x201D; was cut through since the part <italic>not</italic> cut through is not larger than it [the part which <italic>was</italic> cut through]. But so long as more than half was [actually] cut through, it may be eaten, even if it be only by as much as a hair&#x2019;s breadth, as is clearly explained in that Beraitha,<sup><xref rid="fn885">282</xref></sup> and as it emerges from the discussion of the Gemara.</p>

It must be, Ramban suggests, because the reason for Aaron&#x2019;s sin-offering on this eighth day of the initiation was the same as that of his sin-offering on the Day of Atonement, which being &#x201C;an inner sin-offering&#x201D; is rightfully burnt outside the camp, and hence Aaron on this eighth day did similarly.

<ftnote id="fn638">(35) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn639">(36) Verse 16. This shows that the drink-offering was brought together with the people&#x2019;s burnt-offering of the eighth day, for otherwise it would not have been <italic>according to the ordinance</italic>. The question then re-appears: why is the phrase <italic>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</italic> mentioned in connection with the meal-offering?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn640">(37) For one might have thought that since the burnt-offering of the people brought especially on this eighth day was also a public one, it should be exempted from the duty of bringing a meal-offering, as the meal-offering of the Daily Whole-offering had already been brought; hence Scripture stated that this meal-offering which came with the people&#x2019;s burnt-offering, was offered &#x201C;<italic>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</italic> and its meal-offering.&#x201D; It should be pointed out that Ramban refers to this meal-offering as <italic>minchath-nedavah</italic> (&#x201C;<italic>freewill</italic> &#x2014; meal-offering&#x201D;) not because of its voluntary nature, namely that it be optional for Israel to bring it or not. The name <italic>minchath-nedavah</italic> is only to distinguish it from the meal-offering which constantly accompanied the Daily Whole-offering of the people, while this one represented the willing spirit of the people on this day.

It is for this reason that the burning of incense stays the plague. (Numbers 17:11-15). However, the priest who offered it had to direct his mind to the perfect Unity of G-d. And since Nadab and Abihu directed it only to the attribute of justice (see Note 58), therefore they were punished.&#x201D; See further, my Hebrew commentary p. 46.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn678">(75) Verse 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn679">(76) In other words, there is basically no difference between the priests and the Levites as far as the prohibition against a needless entry into the Sanctuary is concerned. If there is a need for it, such as removing an impure object from it, both are permitted [as explained further on in the text] to enter at any time. And if so, why the opinion of Rabbi Akiba that Mishael and Elzaphan put iron hooks on the bodies of Nadab and Abihu in order to remove them from the Sanctuary when they could have gone in directly and remove them? See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. II, pp. 66-67.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn684">(81) Ramban&#x2019;s point is thus: Instead of Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation &#x2014; &#x201C;<italic>That ye die not</italic>. But if you [the sons of Aaron] do this [i.e., let your hair grow long] you shall die&#x201D; &#x2014; the real explanation is as follows: &#x201C;<italic>That ye die not</italic>. You need not fear death for <italic>not</italic> letting your hair grow long,&#x201D; as other mourners would be so punishable if they would not let their hair grow.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn685">(82) This tractate of the Talmud is now called Moed Katan.

<ftnote id="fn687">(84) Moed Katan 14 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn688">(85) An <italic>onen</italic> by law of the Torah is a mourner on the day of death of his relative whether before or after burial on that day. [On the night following he is an <italic>onen</italic> by law of the Rabbis. If burial has not taken place on the day of death he continues to be an <italic>onen</italic> by law of the Rabbis. When burial finally takes place he is an <italic>onen</italic> by law of the Rabbis even after burial, but at night he is no longer considered an <italic>onen</italic> at all.] An <italic>onen</italic> is to be distinguished from an <italic>avel</italic> who is a mourner for a period of seven or thirty days. The laws of mourning as affecting the Divine Service in the Tabernacle and its holy offerings relate to the priest when he is an <italic>onen</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn689">(86) These are: mother, father, son, daughter, brother and sister by the same father. The Sages added: husband, wife, brother and sister by the same mother (Mishneh Torah, <italic>Shoftim, Hilchoth Avel</italic> 2:1).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn690">(87) Further, 21:10-11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn691">(88) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 12.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn703">(100) See Ramban above, 8:35, at end of verse, for explanation of this final interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn704">(101) &#x201C;Supplement.&#x201D; After the Mishnah was completed by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi, a contemporary of his, Rabbi Chiya, compiled a collection of Tannaitic statements and traditions closely allied in form to the Mishnah. The Tosephta follows the order of the tractates of the Mishnah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn705">(102) Having explained above that the admonition applied to Aaron&#x2019;s sons not on that eighth day, but its effect began from the following day onwards, when they would be permitted to minister in the Sanctuary, Ramban now writes that it was possibly a special decision that even on that eighth day they should not leave the Sanctuary, just like their father, who, as High Priest, was permitted to bring offerings as an <italic>onen</italic> and was therefore prohibited from leaving the Sanctuary. This was to serve as a mark of honor and indication of the joyousness of the occasion.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn707">(104) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Shemini Milu&#x2019;im</italic> 28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn708">(105) &#x201C;The analogy is not complete. For those executed by the court no one mourns, neither close relatives nor anyone else. Here only the close relatives were forbidden to mourn, while for others it was expressly commanded, <italic>let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Eternal hath kindled</italic>&#x201D; (Verse 6) (Rabad, in his commentary on Torath Kohanim).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn709">(106) Sanhedrin 46 a. &#x201C;As if to say, &#x2018;We have nothing against you in our hearts, for you have judged the judgment of truth&#x2019; &#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn710">(107) Song of Songs 3:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn711">(108) There are various versions to this interpretation. The final Mishnah in Tractate Taanith has it: &#x201C;<italic>In the day of his espousals</italic> &#x2014; this is the Giving of the Torah. <italic>And in the day of the gladness of his heart</italic> &#x2014; this is the building of the Sanctuary&#x201D; [in Jerusalem].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn712">(109) <italic>He shall abstain from wine and &#x2018;sheichar&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>strong drink</italic>) (Numbers 6:3).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn713">(110) The word <italic>sheichar</italic> must not therefore be understood as strong drink [as it is found in all English translations], but rather as &#x201C;strong wine.&#x201D; The <italic>vav</italic> in the Hebrew <italic>yayin v&#x2019;sheichar</italic> (literally: &#x201C;wine <italic>and</italic> strong wine&#x201D;) is thus to be understood as if it said <italic>yayin k&#x2019;shehu sheichar</italic> &#x2014; you must not drink &#x201C;wine when it is strong wine,&#x201D; or &#x201C;when it is intoxicating&#x201D; (Mizrachi). Rambam&#x2019;s opinion, however, as mentioned further on in the text, is that <italic>sheichar</italic> means &#x201C;strong drink,&#x201D; and the priests were warned against both &#x2014; wine and strong drink, although the punishment for violation was different for each.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn721">(118) If the priest who was in the Sanctuary touched something which necessitates washing of his hands and feet, or if he had given up his intent of doing any more ministration and then decides to do it, he must wash his hands and feet a second time, even though he is no longer, strictly speaking, &#x201C;entering the Sanctuary,&#x201D; since he is there already (Derech Hakodesh, commentary on the Sifra by Vidal Hatzarfati). See also my Hebrew commentary, p. 51, for a different commentary on this text by Rabad.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn722">(119) Thus if he drank the wine whilst inside the Sanctuary and performed the Service, he is liable just like when he drank the wine outside the Sanctuary and entered it in a state of intoxication (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn723">(120) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Shemini</italic> 1:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn724">(121) In Verse 9 before us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn725">(122) Literally: &#x201C;a high place.&#x201D; This was an altar built prior to the establishment of a central Sanctuary, on which offerings to G-d could be brought; on such an altar even a non-priest could perform the rites of offering. <italic>Bamoth</italic> were permitted until the eighth day of consecration when the Tabernacle was erected, but from that day onwards they were prohibited until the people came into the Land of Israel, when for a period of fourteen years comprising the conquest and division of the Land, the Tabernacle was at Gilgal, and <italic>bamoth</italic> were temporarily permitted. Then a central Sanctuary was built at Shiloh, which lasted for 369 years, and during that time the <italic>bamoth</italic> were again prohibited. After the Philistines destroyed the Sanctuary at Shiloh, the <italic>bamoth</italic> were once again permitted. This period [covering also the reigns of Saul and David] lasted 57 years, and is known as that of Nob and Gibeon. Then finally the Sanctuary at Jerusalem was built, and from then on the <italic>bamoth</italic> were prohibited forever, since that is &#x201C;the Eternal House,&#x201D; so that even when it was destroyed, the place is still holy. &#x2014; From this account it is thus clear why as stated in the Torath Kohanim [mentioned further on in the text] the central Sanctuary at Shiloh and &#x201C;the Eternal House&#x201D; at Jerusalem were alike as far as the prohibition to perform the Service while drunk is concerned. In both only a priest could perform the Service, while at a <italic>bamah</italic> even an Israelite was permitted to do it.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn729">(126) Exodus 29:27.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn730">(127) This whole text of Rashi quoted by Ramban is missing in all standard versions of Rashi. It is found, however, in the Reggio edition of 1475, &#x201C;Rashi&#x2019;s Commentary to the Pentateuch.&#x201D; This book incidentally was the first Hebrew book to appear in print. A facsimilie thereof has lately appeared in Jerusalem.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn731">(128) Exodus 29:22-25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn732">(129) Above, 7:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn733">(130) It is so clearly stated in Exodus 29:26: <italic>And thou</italic> [Moses] <italic>shalt take the breast of Aaron&#x2019;s ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave-offering before the Eternal; and it shall be thy portion</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn734">(131) Since the fats are burnt with fire they are called &#x201C;the fats of the fire,&#x201D; not &#x201C;the fire of the fats.&#x201D; This comment is found in Rashi&#x2019;s text as quoted by Mizrachi and other commentators. It is not in our printed texts of Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn735">(132) Deuteronomy 18:1. &#x2014; Ramban&#x2019;s intent is as follows: Rashi had inverted the expression in the verse before us because since the fats are burned with fire, they are called &#x201C;the fats of the fire,&#x201D; and not &#x201C;the fire-offerings of the fats&#x201D; as the verse literally has it. But Ramban quotes the above-mentioned verse from Deuteronomy to show that the word <italic>ishei</italic> does not have its precise meaning of &#x201C;the fires of,&#x201D; since the priests do not eat that which has actually been on the fire upon the altar. The word <italic>ishei</italic> must therefore be taken as an adjectival-noun for all offerings, since most of them are put upon the fire. Consequently the fats are not called <italic>ishei</italic> because of the fire, and the expression in the verse need not be inverted. &#x2014; Ramban now proceeds to comment on the second point that Rashi made, namely that from the verse here we learn that the fat-portions were at the bottom at the time of waving.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn736">(133) Verse 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn737">(134) It is above, 7:30. See Ramban <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn738">(135) Rashi therefore should not have written, &#x201C;From here we learn etc.,&#x201D; as it is not from here that we learn it, since the law of waving is mentioned elsewhere; here it is mentioned only incidentally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn739">(136) Numbers 28:15. &#x2014; The eighth day on which all the events described here, took place was the first of Nisan, the New Moon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn740">(137) Above, 9:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn741">(138) Numbers 7:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn742">(139) Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Shimon (Zebachim 101 a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn743">(140) Verse 19. These are Aaron&#x2019;s words to Moses in defense of his sons having burnt the sin-offering, saying, <italic>and if I had eaten the sin-offering today, would it have been pleasing in the sight of the Eternal</italic>? Now it is on the word &#x201C;today&#x201D; that Rashi comments: &#x201C;by day etc.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn744">(141) The reason, Aaron continued, why the sin-offering was burnt, is because there is a difference between <italic>occasional</italic> [such as the people&#x2019;s sin-offering brought on that particular day, and the sin-offering of Nachshon, prince of the tribe of Judah &#x2014; see Numbers 7:16] and offerings that are obligatory for all generations [such as the sin-offering of the New Moon]. &#x201C;If you [Moses] have been commanded that the occasional offerings be eaten by the priests even while they are <italic>onenim</italic>, you cannot apply this leniency in the case of offerings that are obligatory for all generations.&#x201D; As Verse 20 states, Moses was well-pleased with this answer, and as explained by Rashi, he was not ashamed to admit his error.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn745">(142) Literally: &#x201C;One who [having incurred some impurity] immersed himself [in an immersion-pool] on that day,&#x201D; but must wait for sunset to be perfectly pure. &#x2014; In passing it may be noted that in the time of Ramban all texts of the Talmud were in manuscript form, and page numbers were unknown. A reference to any particular place in the Talmud had to be made on the basis of the name of the chapter. Hence Ramban&#x2019;s expression here: &#x201C;and so it is in the Gemara, in the Chapter <italic>Tebul Yom</italic>.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn746">(143) Above, 9:22.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn749">(146) Verse 1 in this chapter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn750">(147) The Tur answers Ramban&#x2019;s question by pointing out that the verse in 9:23 speaks only of the particular offerings that were brought especially on that day, but mentions nothing of the sin-offering of the New Moon, obligatory for all generations. That offering had not yet been brought, and Moses therefore properly questioned them on it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn751">(148) And as to the reason why the offering was burnt, see above, Note 141.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn752">(149) See Ramban above, 5:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn753">(150) Above, 10:10. It should be noted at this point that the terms &#x201C;clean&#x201D; or &#x201C;cleanness,&#x201D; and &#x201C;unclean&#x201D; or &#x201C;uncleanness,&#x201D; are here in the translation used interchangeably with those of &#x201C;pure&#x201D; or &#x201C;purity&#x201D; and &#x201C;impure&#x201D; or &#x201C;impurity&#x201D;. This was felt necessary in order to convey the thought that uncleanness in the Biblical sense is not something that can be rubbed off with some material object. On the other hand, the terms &#x201C;pure&#x201D; and &#x201C;impure&#x201D; suggest a far greater measure of spirituality. The same comment applies equally to the following portions of the Torah &#x2014; <italic>Tazria, Metzora</italic>, etc.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn756">(153) Verse 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn757">(154) Verse 8. This is Ramban&#x2019;s concluding opinion, that the verse applies to both &#x2014; those animals having no sign at all, and the four mentioned as having only one sign. Ramban proceeds to show that from Rashi&#x2019;s text it would appear that this verse applies only to the four mentioned animals, while the prohibition against those having no sign at all is derived from another source. This explanation Ramban differs from in the text which follows.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn760">(157) <italic>These ye may eat</italic> (Verse 2). From this we deduce the converse, negative commandment, that any animal which does <italic>not</italic> have these two characteristics of a permissible animal, is not allowed as food; and a negative commandment derived from a positive commandment has the force of a positive commandment. Hence one who eats an impure animal violates both a positive commandment [<italic>these ye may eat</italic>, as explained above], and negative commandment [<italic>of their flesh ye shall not eat</italic>], See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. II, pp. 167-168).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn766">(163) The name of the Sage is Rabbi Shimon (Sanhedrin 86 a). See my Hebrew commentary, p. 54.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn767">(164) Verse 5. Thus, Scripture having stated <italic>the reason why</italic> the rock-badger is forbidden as food, it follows that any animal to which the same reason applies, is likewise forbidden on the strength of that verse, and not because of some other logical reasoning.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn776">(173) Deuteronomy 21:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn777">(174) Abodah Zarah 29 b. Thus Ramban agrees with Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Rambam) that the matters under discussion are forbidden, the difference of opinion among them being only as to which law is violated. It is a rule in the administration of punishment that the violator of the law must have been pre-warned by witnesses of the <italic>specific</italic> prohibition entailed and the punishment to which the violator would be subject to by the hand of the court. Ramban and Rambam thus differ as to the nature of the prohibition the violator must be reminded of, in order that he be punishable by the court.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn778">(175) Verse 16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn779">(176) Lamentations 3:10. The verb-form clearly shows that the word <italic>dov</italic> is masculine in form.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn780">(177) Isaiah 11:7. The verse clearly indicates that while <italic>parah</italic> is feminine in form, and <italic>dov</italic> is masculine in form, it nonetheless refers also to the female, as is shown by the feminine form of the verb <italic>tir&#x2019;enah</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn800">(197) &#x201C;These are accounted as <italic>treifah</italic> animals&#x201D; [so that they may not be eaten]. Chullin 67b. See in the Book of Exodus, <italic>Seder Mishpatim</italic>, p. 373, Note 189.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn801">(198) Shall we say that since it was <italic>capable</italic> of creeping upon the earth it is termed &#x201C;a swarming thing that swarms upon the earth&#x201D; and thus forbidden by Scripture as food or maybe it is only forbidden if it has <italic>actually</italic> swarmed upon the earth?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn802">(199) Further, Verse 41.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn803">(200) &#x201C;The wicked Titus&#x201D; was the Roman general who burnt the Second Temple, whose punishment in this world was, as the Midrash tells: &#x201C;They poured him a cup of wine, and the Holy One, blessed be He, prepared for him one <italic>yitush</italic> (mosquito) which entered into his nostrils&#x201D; and plagued him all his life (Vayikra Rabbah 22:2). Thus it is clear that the <italic>yitush</italic> breeds in wine: See Gittin 56 b for a full account of this mosquito in Titus&#x2019; brain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn804">(201) Shabbath 156 a. See my Hebrew commentary p. 57, that the reading in our text of the Gemara there, is different [namely, &#x201C;All authorities agree that one is permitted to stir etc.&#x201D;], and the exact source of Ramban&#x2019;s quotation is unknown to me.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn805">(202) Zebachim 22 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn806">(203) The required measure of water for an immersion-pool is for [[illegible]] seahs. The laver had to have enough water in it for four priests to be able to wash their hands and feet at the same time.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn807">(204) Resh Lakesh who used the expression <italic>mashlim</italic> (fill up), which implies merely a completion of measure by some addition, could therefore not have referred to these <italic>yavchushim</italic>, since even if the pool is composed entirely of them, it is also valid for immersion&#x0021; &#x2014; For Ramban&#x2019;s intent in quoting this text, see further, Note 206.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn808">(205) The title &#x201C;Rabban&#x201D; (&#x201C;our Rabbi&#x201D; &#x2014; instead of &#x201C;Rabbi&#x201D;) indicates that the person was the <italic>Nasi</italic> (head) of the Sanhedrin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn809">(206) Thus it is clearly shown that <italic>yavchushim</italic> are found in water, and Rashi&#x2019;s comment that <italic>yavchushim</italic> are those insects called [in old French] <italic>mousclions</italic> is therefore incorrect, since these germinate in wine, and in Hebrew they are called <italic>yitushim</italic>, while <italic>yavchushim</italic> germinate in water.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn813">(210) Verses 29-30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn814">(211) According to Rashi (Chullin 59 a) this means that the bird seizes its food from the ground in its claws, and eats it. Rabbeinu Tam explains it as meaning that it eats animals before they are dead. Ramban in his commentary (<italic>ibid.</italic>) interprets it as a bird of prey that kills by attacking with its claws. Further on in the text here Ramban will also elaborate on this characteristic.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn815">(212) See in <italic>Seder Vayikra</italic> Note 264.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn818">(215) In his commentary to Tractate Chullin 62 b, Ramban relates that in order to ascertain the meaning of the Talmudic texts on the difficult subject of the signs of birds, he conducted a lengthy investigation into the characteristics of all kinds of birds, realizing that &#x201C;we cannot deny things visible to the eyes.&#x201D; This is the background of his concise statement here: &#x201C;It is something we have searched etc.&#x201D; Discussions he held with hunters were also a part of that investigation.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn821">(218) See Genesis, Vol. I, pp. 47-48, where Ramban discusses the same theme. Here the subject is more fully developed.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn825">(222) See above, Note 117.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn826">(223) I.e., <italic>Yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things</italic> etc. (Verse 21), from which you derive the principle that those that do not meet these criteria, are forbidden to be eaten by means of a negative commandment, and a negative commandment derived from a positive commandment carries the force of the positive commandment. Hence he who eats forbidden winged swarming (or creeping) things transgresses a positive commandment, for which there is no punishment by the court. But in the Book of Deuteronomy, Ramban continues, there is also an express negative commandment against eating it. Hence he who eats it incurs whipping.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn827">(224) Deuteronomy 14: 19. See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, pp. 157-158; Vol. II, pp. 169-170.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn828">(225) In Verse 26. This part of the quotation from Rashi is also found in our Rashi texts on that verse, hence the use of the word &#x201C;here.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn829">(226) Verses 39-40.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn830">(227) The twofold question is to be understood as follows: Why did Scripture divide and discuss them in two separate sections, and why was it necessary that the laws referring to the impurity conveyed by touching the carcasses of <italic>unclean</italic> animals, were discussed in Verses 24-28 in detail, with separate verses for each category of these unclean animals, when one general statement could have covered all subjects?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn831">(228) Further, Verse 39.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn832">(229) Verse 26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn833">(230) Verses 27 and 28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn834">(231) Verse 29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn835">(232) There in Verse 29 and in Verse 30: <italic>the weasel, and the mouse</italic> etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn836">(233) Ibn Ezra explained the expression <italic>and by those ye shall become unclean</italic> (in Verse 24 before us) as referring to <italic>sheretz ha&#x2019;oph</italic> (winged creeping things) and also to the fowls unfit for food as mentioned above in Scripture. But this is a mistake, since no impurity is conveyed by a fowl unfit for food, nor by a winged creeping thing unfit for food.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn837">(234) Deuteronomy 14:4-5. Scripture begins here with <italic>beheimah</italic> and goes on to enumerate <italic>chayah</italic> (beasts).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn838">(235) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Shemini</italic> 6:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn839">(236) Verse 25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn840">(237) Further, Verse 32.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn841">(238) Further, 17:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn842">(239) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 16. I.e., if he ate holy food or entered the Sanctuary in an impure state.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn843">(240) Further, 34, 37-38.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn844">(241) In Verse 31: <italic>These are which are unclean to you among all that creep; whosoever doth &#x2018;touch them, when they are dead,&#x2019; shall be unclean until the even</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn845">(242) Chagigah 11 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn846">(243) Since Scripture (here in Verse 32) states <italic>&#x2018;any of them&#x2019; when they are dead</italic>, it shows that even though one has not touched the whole creeping thing but &#x201C;any&#x201D; part of it, he is rendered impure. &#x201C;Now since the sand-lizard [one of the eight creeping things that convey impurity] when born is the size of a lentil,&#x201D; therefore that amount of any of the eight creeping things when dead also conveys impurity (Chagiga <italic>ibid.</italic>). Thus according to the interpretation of the Rabbis, Verse 32 before us also speaks only of the impurity conveyed by creeping things, and not, as explained above, about all other impurities.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn847">(244) Verses 34-36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn848">(245) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Shemini</italic> 6:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn849">(246) In Tractate Yebamoth 74a the reading [instead of &#x201C;ordinary food&#x201D;] is &#x201C;the Tithe;&#x201D; i.e., eaten by the owner in the city of Jerusalem in a state of purity. But the law regarding it is less stringent than that which applies to <italic>terumah</italic> (the heave-offering) eaten by the priest. Thus if an Israelite who was impure immersed himself to be purified, he may straightaway eat of the Second Tithe, even though the sun has not yet set. But a priest who was impure and immersed himself before sunset, may not eat of the heave-offering until the sun has set and the stars have come forth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn850">(247) Verses 24-25, 27-28, 31-32.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn851">(248) Further, 22:6-7. &#x201C;The holy things&#x201D; here mean the <italic>terumah</italic> (the heave-offering).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn852">(249) See above, Note 246.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn853">(250) As explained above in Ramban, Verse 8, at the end.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn854">(251) Hence Scripture always speaks about the impure person being &#x201C;unclean till the even,&#x201D; because in order to be able to eat the heave-offering, the impure priest <italic>must</italic> purify himself, and wait till evening, whereas for ordinary food there is no requirement that it must be eaten in a state of purity, and thus no necessity to immerse oneself. If he does wish to eat it in a state of purity, however, he attains this immediately after immersion and even before sundown, as explained above in Ramban and in Note 246.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn855">(252) Or as generally also referred to &#x201C;a first degree of impurity.&#x201D; Reference here is to a person or vessel that touched one of the eight dead creeping things enumerated in Verses 29-30, which are considered &#x201C;fathers of impurity.&#x201D; The person or vessel that touched them become &#x201C;a first degree of impurity.&#x201D; There are many &#x201C;fathers of impurity.&#x201D; Thus the carrier of those animals that are unfit for food, or of those which are fit for food but have not been slaughtered in the proper ritual manner, mentioned above in this section, also belong to this category [[illegible]] &#x201C;a first degree of impurity.&#x201D; Now &#x201C;fathers of impurity&#x201D; can convey impurity to people and vessels, whereas &#x201C;a first degree of impurity&#x201D; can only convey impurity to foodstuffs and liquids.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn856">(253) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Shemini</italic> 9:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn857">(254) In other words, it was on the basis of this Torath Kohanim that Rashi interpreted the expression in the verse here, <italic>of all food which may be eaten</italic> as applying to &#x201C;impure&#x201D; food <italic>conveying</italic> impurity to others, the verse teaching us that the conveyor of the impurity must be of the size <italic>which may be eaten</italic>, which is, as explained above, the size of an egg. The verse could not refer to the original foodstuff itself becoming impure because of having touched a dead creeping thing [or any &#x201C;father of impurity&#x201D; &#x2014; see above Note 251], for in that case even the smallest quantity of food suffices to be rendered impure. &#x2014; But, Ramban continues, other scholars have already differed with Rashi on this point, bringing proof etc. (see text).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn858">(255) Tosafoth Shabbath 91 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn859">(256) Further. 15:12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn860">(257) Isaiah 30:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn861">(258) The novelty of this point is that generally whatever is attached to the ground is like the ground, and cannot become impure. The oven and range made of clay are thus an exception to this rule, for they are susceptible of impurity even though they are attached to the earth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn862">(259) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 22:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn863">(260) Further, 14:45.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn864">(261) Numbers 19:13. There too, Scripture uses the singular: <italic>lo zorak</italic> (was not sprinkled) in referring to water, although the Hebrew word <italic>&#x2018;mayim&#x2019;</italic> is in the plural form.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn865">(262) In Verse 34 above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn866">(263) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Shemini</italic> 9:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn867">(264) The Sage generally known as &#x201C;Rabbi Yosei&#x201D; was Rabbi Yosei ben Chalafta, a disciple of Rabbi Akiba. To distinguish between him and another great teacher of the same name, the epithet &#x201C;Galilean&#x201D; was added to the name of the latter. It is this Rabbi Yosei whose opinion is here quoted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn868">(265) Above, Verse 32.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn870">(267) Verse 34.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn872">(269) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Shemini</italic> 11:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn873">(270) See Ramban at end of Verse 36 above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn874">(271) Niddah 42 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn875">(272) And therefore He mentioned it in regard to the carrion of an animal fit for food, and from it we apply the rule to the carrion of an animal unfit for food. This is in accordance with similar explanations mentioned above.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn880">(277) Verse 44: &#x201C;<italic>Neither shall ye defile yourselves</italic>. This is repeated to indicate that a person transgresses many negative commandments if he eats the detestable things&#x201D; (Rashi).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn883">(280) For even though <italic>chayah</italic> (beast) is included in the term <italic>beheimah</italic> (cattle), as explained above in Verse 24, yet Scripture mentioned here a specific prohibition with regard to a forbidden <italic>chayah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn884">(281) I.e., between that which has been rendered forbidden for you because you have not slaughtered it properly, and that which has been rendered permitted for you through proper ritual slaughtering (Mizrachi).</ftnote>

<title>Tazria</title>
<h1>12</h1>
<p>2. Rashi commented: &#x201C;<italic>If a woman have conceived seed, and born</italic> [<italic>a male</italic>]. This includes a case where she gave birth to [the male child as] a fleshy mass which had dissolved, so that it became liquefied and like seed, in which case his mother becomes impure because of the birth&#x201D; [as if it were a normal child]. The explanation of this matter<sup><xref rid="fn887">1</xref></sup> is that we know that the child has been formed already in human form, and then became liquefied, for anything that does not have a human form is not considered a child, and similarly, whatever is not fit to become a creature with a soul, is not considered a child. But even if it is a fleshy dissolved mass at the time of birth, it makes the mother impure [for the prescribed number of days] provided we recognize its form, such as a foetus with its human parts fashioned, in which case the mother is certainly impure, and if not [i.e., the matter is in doubt] she is impure because of a doubt. This is what this verse comes to include according to the words of our Rabbis.<sup><xref rid="fn888">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now with regard to the implication of the verse the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn889">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Ishah ki thazria</italic> &#x2014;<sup><xref rid="fn890">4</xref></sup> if the woman emits seed first, she will bear a son.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn891">5</xref></sup> The intent of the Rabbis was not that the child is formed from the woman&#x2019;s seed, for although the woman has generative organs [i.e., ovaries] like those of the man, yet seed is not formed by them at all, or [if it is formed], that seed is not thick and does not contribute anything to the embryo. Rather, the Rabbis used the term &#x201C;she emits seed&#x201D; with reference to the blood of the womb, which gathers in the mother at the time of the consummation of coition, and attaches itself to the seed of the male. For in the opinion of the Rabbis the child is formed from the blood of the female and the white [semen] of the man, and both of them are called &#x201C;seed.&#x201D; Thus the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn889">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;There are three partners in [the formation of] man: The male emits the white [semen], from which are formed the sinews, the bones, and the white substance in the eye. The female emits a red secretion from which are formed the skin, the flesh, the blood, the hair, and the black substance in the eye.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn892">6</xref></sup> The opinion of doctors as to the formation [of the embryo of the child] is also the same. In the opinion of the Greek philosophers,<sup><xref rid="fn893">7</xref></sup> however, the whole body of the child is formed from [the substance of] the blood of the mother, the father only contributing that generative force which is known in their language as <italic>hyly</italic>, which gives form to matter.<sup><xref rid="fn894">8</xref></sup> For there is no difference at all between the egg of a chicken which is laid because it was fructified by a male, and that laid as a result of the mother rolling herself in the dust, except that the egg [that had been fructified by a male] germinates into a young bird, while the other is <italic>not sown, nor beareth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn895">9</xref></sup> because it is deprived of the elemental heat which is its <italic>hyly</italic>. And if so, the word <italic>tazria</italic> [in <italic>ishah ki thazria</italic>] will be like <italic>u&#x2019;cheganah zeiru&#x2019;eha thatzmiach</italic> (<italic>as the garden causeth the seeds that are sown in it to spring forth</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn896">10</xref></sup> And so did Onkelos render it: &#x201C;If a woman conceives.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x2018;D&#x2019;VOTHAH.&#x2019; &#x201C;This is an expression for anything which flows from her body, derived from the wording<sup><xref rid="fn897">11</xref></sup> for malady [<italic>madveh</italic>] and sickness, for no woman sees an issue of blood without becoming unwell, and her head and her limbs feeling heavy on her.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But I do not know on the basis of which root the word <italic>d&#x2019;vothah</italic> can be an expression in the Sacred Language for &#x201C;anything which flows.&#x201D; But it is possible that it is an expression of malady, on the basis of what the Rabbis have said,<sup><xref rid="fn898">12</xref></sup> &#x201C;and her head and limbs are heavy on her.&#x201D; So also is the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, who writes: &#x201C;<italic>D&#x2019;vothah</italic> is a noun and means sickness, for the blood which issues indicates a sickness in the woman.&#x201D; Now it is true that the flow constitutes a cleansing of surpluses [of blood], and due to the fact that her head and her limbs feel heavy upon her, the flow is perhaps termed &#x201C;a sickness.&#x201D; The correct interpretation, however, is that <italic>d&#x2019;vothah</italic> is an expression derived from the word <italic>madveh</italic> [which does not mean &#x201C;sickness,&#x201D; i.e., an unnatural occurrence in the body, since a woman&#x2019;s menses are natural; and <italic>d&#x2019;vothah</italic> is therefore like the terms] plague and pain, just as in the expressions: <italic>My heart is &#x2018;davoi&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>faint</italic>) <italic>within me;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn899">13</xref></sup> <italic>for this our heart is &#x2018;daveh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>faint</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn900">14</xref></sup> and like: <italic>the plague of his heart</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn901">15</xref></sup> Thus menstruation is an affliction upon the woman even though it is in her nature [to experience it regularly]. A similar expression is <italic>upon the bed of &#x2018;d&#x2019;voi&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>illness</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn902">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND SHE SHALL THEN &#x2018;TEISHEIV&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn903">17</xref></sup> (REMAIN) IN THE BLOOD OF PURIFICATION THREE AND THIRTY DAYS. &#x201C;The term <italic>yeshivah</italic> [literally: <italic>sitting</italic>] signifies here &#x2018;remaining,&#x2019; just like in the verses: <italic>&#x2018;vateishvu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and ye stayed</italic>) <italic>in Kadesh;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn904">18</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;vayeishev&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and he dwelled</italic>) <italic>by the terebinths of Mamre</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn905">19</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But if so, the verse is stating: &#x201C;for another thirty-three days she should still wait, touching no hallowed thing nor coming into the Sanctuary, even though they are days of purity as far as [physical relationship with] her husband,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn906">20</xref></sup> this being the sense of the expression <italic>in the blood of purification</italic>. Scripture uses this expression [<italic>&#x2018;remain&#x2019; in the blood of purification</italic>, instead of saying &#x201C;and she shall then be &#x2026; &#x201D;] in order to inform us that even though she sees no issue of blood during these [thirty-three days for a male child, or sixty-six for a female], she must still wait this entire period on account of the childbirth [before she may eat of the hallowed food or enter the Sanctuary]. It is possible that the expression <italic>teisheiv</italic> here is like in the verse, <italic>Many days &#x2018;teishvi&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thou shalt sit solitary</italic>) <italic>for me; thou shalt not play the harlot, and then thou shalt not be any man&#x2019;s wife</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn907">21</xref></sup> for a woman who has intercourse with her husband is called <italic>yosheveth lo</italic> (sitting for him). Now since He said in regard to the seven days [after the birth of the male child], <italic>she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of the sickness shall she be unclean</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn908">22</xref></sup> meaning that she be impure to her husband and for hallowed food during all these seven days, He now said that after the seven days she may sit for her husband [i.e., she may have intercourse with him] for thirty-three days in the blood of purification, but still she may not touch hallowed things nor come into the Sanctuary, even if she sees [no issue of blood], and she may be with her husband even if she sees [an issue].<sup><xref rid="fn909">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that a woman in the days of her menstruation is called <italic>niddah</italic> (shunned) because she was avoided by and kept distant from all people. Men and women would not approach her, and she would sit alone and not speak with them, for even her speech was considered by them impure, and they regarded the dust upon which she stepped to be impure as the dust of the decomposed bones of the dead. Our Rabbis have mentioned this.<sup><xref rid="fn910">24</xref></sup> Even her gaze was considered harmful, and I have already mentioned this in <italic>Seder Vayeitzei Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn911">25</xref></sup> Thus it was the custom of menstruants to sit in a special tent, this being the intent of Rachel&#x2019;s words to her father [Laban], <italic>Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn912">26</xref></sup> since it was their custom that a woman in that condition should not walk, nor let the sole of her foot step upon the ground. That is why the Torah was more stringent in regard to what the menstruant sits upon or lies upon [in that both the person who touches them and his garments are rendered impure]<sup><xref rid="fn913">27</xref></sup> than with respect to touching [the menstruant herself, in which case the person himself is rendered impure, but not his garments].<sup><xref rid="fn914">28</xref></sup> Similarly Scripture said in regard to the leper: <italic>he shall dwell</italic> [literally: &#x201C;sit&#x201D;] <italic>alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn915">29</xref></sup> and it did not say as it did in the case of the other impure persons, <italic>and he shall go out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn916">30</xref></sup> Rather, it mentioned the term &#x201C;sitting,&#x201D; meaning that he is to avoid walking, since his odor and breath are harmful. It is for this reason that Scripture says here that for another thirty-three days <italic>she shall &#x2018;sit&#x2019; in the blood of purification</italic>, in the same place where she sat in the [seven] days of impurity on account of the childbirth, and further prohibited by means of a negative commandment from touching hallowed things or coming into the Sanctuary during that time. The [Rabbinical] interpretation thereof is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn917">31</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>She shall continue</italic> [in the blood of purification for three and thirty days]. This comes to include a woman in hard labor during the eleven days,<sup><xref rid="fn918">32</xref></sup> that she be pure from <italic>zivah</italic> (the law of &#x2018;flux&#x2019;).<sup><xref rid="fn919">33</xref></sup> I might think that she should also be regarded as pure from [the impurity conveyed through] menstruation;<sup><xref rid="fn920">34</xref></sup> Scripture therefore says [<italic>as in the days of the impurity of her sickness</italic>] <italic>shall she be unclean</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn921">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THE BLOOD OF &#x2018;TAHORAH&#x2019; (PURIFICATION). According to Rashi this means that even though she sees [an issue of blood during this period of thirty-three days for a male child, and sixty-six for a female], she is nevertheless pure by law of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn909">23</xref></sup> And so did Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra write, that the meaning of the above expression is that &#x201C;it constitutes pure blood in contrast to the blood of the menstruant, and therefore does not convey impurity, G-d having decreed in the case of a male child [a forty-days period for the after-effects of the childbirth upon the mother &#x2014; seven impure days and thirty-three pure days], corresponding to the number of days necessary for the form of the male child to be completed in the womb, while that of the female child is double [fourteen impure days and sixty-six pure days, corresponding to the eighty days it takes for the female child to be formed in the mother&#x2019;s womb]. This is clear and tested.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But in my opinion the meaning of the word <italic>tahorah</italic> is cleanness [in a physical sense], similar in meaning to <italic>&#x2018;zahav tahor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>pure gold</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn922">36</xref></sup> which means smelted and refined. A similar expression is found in the verse, <italic>And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn923">37</xref></sup> Thus the meaning of the expression here is as follows. Having commanded that a woman who gives birth to a male child be impure for seven days <italic>as in the days of her impurity</italic>, because then she usually sees issues of blood from the interior of the womb [from which the menses are discharged], He further commanded that she should wait for another thirty-three days, staying in her house in order to cleanse her body; for during all these days she will emit the remnants of blood and the turbid, ill-smelling secretions which come from these bloods, and then she will become cleansed <italic>from the childbirth, pregnancy and conception</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn924">38</xref></sup> and she may come to the House of G-d. Now our Rabbis have received the tradition that during these [thirty-three days for a male child and sixty-six for a female], she is pure for her husband, because with reference to the seven impure days it says that they are <italic>as in the days of the impurity of her sickness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn908">22</xref></sup> but in connection with these [thirty-three days etc.] He said that she is impure as regards [eating or touching] hallowed things and entering the Sanctuary, but not for non-holy things nor for her husband, just as the Rabbis have said,<sup><xref rid="fn925">39</xref></sup> &#x201C;Her husband is not a holy object.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The reason that the time is doubled in the case of the birth of a female child [i.e., fourteen impure days and sixty-six pure days], is perhaps as Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said [as mentioned above] in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael, that the formation of a male child is completed on the forty-first day, and that of a female child on the eighty-first day. But according to the opinion of the Sages who say that both male and female are completed on the forty-first day, we must say that the reason [why the time is doubled in the case of a female child] is that the nature of the female is cold and moist, and the white [fluid] in the mother&#x2019;s womb is then exceedingly abundant and cold, this being the reason why she gave birth to a female child. Hence she needs a longer time to become clean [in a physical sense], on account of the abundant moisture in her which contains the ill-smelling blood, and on account of the coldness [of her body], as is well-known that sick people who suffer from cold need a longer period to restore their vigor than those who are hot.</p>
<p>7. AND HE SHALL OFFER IT BEFORE THE ETERNAL, AND MAKE ATONEMENT FOR HER; AND SHE SHALL BE CLEANSED FROM THE FOUNTAIN OF HER BLOOD. Scripture is stating that she shall offer a ransom for her soul<sup><xref rid="fn926">40</xref></sup> before the Eternal so that she shall be cleansed <italic>from the fountain of her blood</italic>, for a woman in childbirth has <italic>a troubled fountain and a tainted spring</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn927">41</xref></sup> and after she has completed the number of days of becoming clean [as explained above in Verse 4], or the days of the formation of the child, male or female,<sup><xref rid="fn928">42</xref></sup> she shall then bring a ransom for her soul so that her fountain should be stayed, and that she should become cleansed, for G-d, praised be He, &#x201C;heals all flesh and does wondrously.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn929">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn930">44</xref></sup> that [the reason for these offerings is] that at the moment that she bends down to give birth she rashly swears [because of the pains of childbirth]: &#x201C;I will no longer have relationships with my husband&#x201D; [so as not to conceive again]. The main purport of this statement of the Rabbis is that since she only swears on account of her pain, and the oath is moreover not capable of fulfillment, because she is subject to her husband, therefore the Torah wished for her to atone for that which came into her mind [and therefore commanded her to bring these offerings]. G-d&#x2019;s thoughts, blessed be He, are deep,<sup><xref rid="fn931">45</xref></sup> and His mercies are bountiful, for it is His desire to justify His creatures.</p>
<h1>13</h1>
<p>1. AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON. Because it is according to the word of the priest <italic>that every strife and every plague shall be</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn932">46</xref></sup> therefore this communication came also to Aaron. Or it may mean that G-d spoke to Moses that he should tell it to Aaron, as our Rabbis have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn933">47</xref></sup> It does not state here, &#x201C;speak unto the children of Israel,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn934">48</xref></sup> because it is the priests [who have the duty] when they see the impure [with leprosy] to force them to be quarantined and be cleansed. Now in the section dealing with cleansing of the leper it says, <italic>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses, saying: This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn935">49</xref></sup> [and there it mentions neither &#x201C;speak to the children of Israel,&#x201D; nor to the priests], because there is no need to urge the Israelite to become cleansed [when his plague of leprosy is healed], nor to urge the priest to perform the rites of the offerings, as they do so willingly. In the section dealing with a person suffering from an issue it does say, <italic>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn936">50</xref></sup> because since the matter is of an intimate nature, unknown to others, He admonished them that they should each inform the priest of their sickness.<sup><xref rid="fn937">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. &#x2018;SE&#x2019;EITH O SAPACHATH O BAHERETH&#x2019; (A RISING, OR A SCAB, OR A BRIGHT SPOT). &#x201C;These are the names of the plagues, each one whiter than the other.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that &#x201C;<italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> is a term for &#x2018;burning,&#x2019; the word being associated with the expressions: <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;hamaseith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and the beacon</italic>) <italic>began to arise up;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn938">52</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;va&#x2019;yisa&#x2019;eim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and</italic>) <italic>David</italic> (<italic>burned them</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn939">53</xref></sup> It is possible that it is called <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> [literally: &#x2018;uprising,&#x2019; &#x2018;swelling&#x2019;], because it is in the nature of fire to rise upwards. <italic>Sapachath</italic> is of the root: <italic>&#x2018;sphacheini&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>attach me</italic>), <italic>I pray;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn940">54</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;nispechu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and they shall cleave</italic>) <italic>to the house of Jacob</italic><sup><xref rid="fn941">55</xref></sup> &#x2014; signifying a sickness which attaches to one place. <italic>Bahereth</italic> is of the root, <italic>&#x2018;bahir&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>bright</italic>) <italic>in the skies</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn942">56</xref></sup> becoming a sort of sign or mark.&#x201D; [Thus far is Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s interpretation.] If so, the term <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> is the name of the plague caused by the bitter green burning fluid [in the body],<sup><xref rid="fn943">57</xref></sup> and <italic>bahereth</italic> is caused by the white fluid, and <italic>sapachath</italic> is brought about by a combination of both of these fluids. Now our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn944">58</xref></sup> &#x201C;The word <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> is always an expression of &#x2018;rising,&#x2019; and so it is stated in Scripture, <italic>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills &#x2018;hanisa&#x2019;oth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>that are lifted up</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn945">59</xref></sup> and <italic>sapachath</italic> always means &#x2018;attachment,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn946">60</xref></sup> and so it is stated in Scripture, <italic>&#x2018;sphacheini&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>attach me</italic>), <italic>I pray</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn940">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE PLAGUE BE DEEPER THAN THE SKIN OF THE FLESH. &#x201C;Every white color appears deep [in contrast to the darker color surrounding it], just as a color illuminated by the sun appears deeper than the shadow.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. For this reason when the Rabbi [Rashi] reached the following verse, stating, <italic>And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn947">61</xref></sup> he wrote, &#x201C;I do not know the meaning of this.&#x201D; The sense of Rashi&#x2019;s statement is as follows: It appeared to him difficult, for since the bright spot is white, it is impossible that the appearance thereof should <italic>not</italic> be deeper than the skin, even as the color of anything illuminated by the sun appears deeper than the shadow&#x0021;</p>
<p>Now we are in a position to remove this difficulty. For the verses do not speak of the appearance of a plague seeming deeper than the skin, unless two hairs in the plague become white [such being the case in Verse 3 before us]. But when it states [as it does in the following verse], <italic>and the hair thereof be not turned white</italic>, it says, <italic>and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn947">61</xref></sup> For such is the distinctive characteristic of anything illuminated by the sun: if there is something black scattered about in it, there will not be an appearance of depth to a person who looks at it. Now hair in its natural state is dark, and therefore destroys the appearance of depth of the plague. When the hairs in the plague have turned white or yellow,<sup><xref rid="fn948">62</xref></sup> then only does the whiteness of the plague shine brightly, and appears to anyone who looks at it from a distance as if it were deeper [than the skin of the flesh].</p>
<p>Yet despite all this, that which the Rabbi [Rashi] has said &#x2014; &#x201C;Every white color is deeper [in contrast to dark colors surrounding it]&#x201D; &#x2014; does not appear to me to be correct. For the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn944">58</xref></sup> &#x201C;The word <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> is always an expression of &#x2018;rising,&#x2019; &#x201D; and the <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> is white, as it is written, <italic>&#x2018;se&#x2019;eith l&#x2019;vanah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a white rising</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn949">63</xref></sup> and the Rabbis have further said:<sup><xref rid="fn950">64</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Se&#x2019;eith</italic> is [as white] as white wool, and its second [subsidiary] shade is as white as the membrane of an egg.&#x201D; Thus <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> is very white, and [according to Rashi] it should appear very deep, so why then do the Rabbis call it &#x201C;rising?&#x201D; Scripture also does not state anywhere concerning the color of <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> that it is deeper than the skin&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn951">65</xref></sup> And in the Torah Kohanim the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn952">66</xref></sup> &#x201C;What is the meaning of the term <italic>se&#x2019;eith?</italic> It is &#x2018;rising,&#x2019; just as the color of the shadow is <italic>higher</italic> than that of anything illuminated by the sun.&#x201D; And if every white color is deep [in contrast to a dark color surrounding it, as Rashi put it], then the fact is the opposite [of what the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim]&#x0021; Perhaps we may say that the terms <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> signifies &#x201C;rising&#x201D; in contrast to <italic>bahereth</italic>, so that if you place both of them together, the <italic>bahereth</italic> will appear as if illuminated by the sun, and the <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> at its side will have the appearance of the shadow, while both of them in relation to the skin [which is darker] will appear as deeper.<sup><xref rid="fn953">67</xref></sup> Yet Scripture [nonetheless] does not speak of the color of <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> as being deeper than the skin&#x0021;</p>
<p>The explanation of this matter appears to me to be as follows. There is a kind of white which shines into and dazzles the eyes just as the appearance of the sun does, with the result that the eyes are incapable of receiving the intense color of that whiteness, and therefore it seems to him [a person looking] as if it were deep, just as the color illuminated by the sun appears deeper than the shadow, because the eye can receive the darker color and it is fixed thereon, whereas the white color scatters the visionary power and appears further removed from it, and therefore seems to be deep. Thus the whiteness of <italic>bahereth</italic> which is a bright white like snow,<sup><xref rid="fn954">68</xref></sup> causes the visionary power to be weakened, just as it becomes weak in a place illuminated by the sun, provided that there is no black hair in the <italic>bahereth</italic>, in which case the visionary power concentrates on the black and from there it spreads out to the whole appearance of the plague and does not &#x201C;flee&#x201D; from it [on account of its intense whiteness, and therefore it does not appear to be deeper than the skin].<sup><xref rid="fn955">69</xref></sup> Now the plague known as <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> is also white, but its whiteness is not intense [as that of <italic>bahereth</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn956">70</xref></sup> and it does not weaken the visionary power; therefore the eye spreads out [over the whole plague] and sees it closely with the result that the <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> appears near to it and elevated, just as when one looks at the stars which appear to be high in the heavens.</p>
<p>Now in the case of an inflammation [in the skin, in which symptoms of leprosy occurred], Scripture mentions two colors, <italic>a white &#x2018;se&#x2019;eith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>rising</italic>) <italic>or a white &#x2018;bahereth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>bright spot</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn957">71</xref></sup> intermingled with red, and states concerning it, <italic>behold, it be in sight &#x2018;lower&#x2019; than the skin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn958">72</xref></sup> but does not say &#x201C;deeper&#x201D; [than the skin], because although that <italic>bahereth</italic> is an intense white, the redness in it lessens the &#x201C;depth&#x201D; thereof and makes it appear only slightly &#x201C;lower&#x201D; [than the skin].</p>
<p>But by way of the plain meaning of Scripture the phrase <italic>behold, it be in sight &#x2018;lower&#x2019; than the skin</italic> only refers back to the <italic>bahereth</italic>, but of <italic>the white se&#x2019;eith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>rising</italic><sup><xref rid="fn957">71</xref></sup> it does not say so.<sup><xref rid="fn959">73</xref></sup> And concerning both of them [<italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> and <italic>bahereth</italic>] Scripture says [in the case of an inflammation in the skin], <italic>But behold, if there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn960">74</xref></sup> for on account of the redness [which is intermingled in the white], and the blackness of the hair, the plague has lost even its appearance of being &#x201C;lower&#x201D; [than the skin] and is only &#x201C;dim.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In the case of a burning by fire Scripture mentions, <italic>and the quick flesh of the burnt part have a white &#x2018;bahereth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>bright spot</italic>), <italic>reddish-white or white</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn961">75</xref></sup> and then it continues [in the following verse] to state, <italic>and it be in sight &#x2018;deeper&#x2019; than the skin;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn962">76</xref></sup> [that refers back only] to &#x201C;the white&#x201D; [in the preceding verse, but not to the reddish-white, which, as explained above, does not appear to be &#x201C;deeper&#x201D; than the skin]. Then it states further on, <italic>But if the priest look on it, and behold, there be no white hair in the &#x2018;bahereth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>bright spot</italic>), <italic>and it be no lower than the skin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn963">77</xref></sup> In this case He mentioned the matter of being &#x201C;lower&#x201D; or not with reference [also] to &#x201C;the reddish-white&#x201D; [in Verse 24], thus teaching that the appearance of the plague either as &#x201C;deep&#x201D; or &#x201C;low&#x201D; is an indication of impurity, and that they are only pure if there is no appearance at all [of the bright spot] being &#x201C;lower&#x201D; than the skin, but instead it is only &#x201C;dim.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn964">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the Torah desired the purity of Israel and the cleanliness of their bodies, and it therefore took measures to keep this sickness [of leprosy] far from them at its very inception, for these colors [of the plagues] are not yet the real leprosy, but they lead to it. Doctors state in their books: &#x201C;We should fear <italic>beharoth</italic> [bright spots in the skin of the flesh] more than the leprosy itself.&#x201D; That is the reason why Scripture calls them when they are just beginning, <italic>the affliction of leprosy</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn965">79</xref></sup> meaning an affliction of a leprous nature, but not yet the actual leprosy. It is when the symptoms of impurity are clearly identified, after the leper has been put in quarantine [for a trial period], that Scripture says, <italic>it is leprosy</italic><sup><xref rid="fn966">80</xref></sup> meaning that it is possible that it is a genuine form of leprosy. At times Scripture will say of impurity, <italic>and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an affliction of leprosy</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn967">81</xref></sup> the meaning thereof being to state that the priest shall declare him impure at once, for it is an affliction of a leprous nature that will surely result in actual leprosy, and therefore it is advisable that he be separated from the people from that moment on. Similarly, <italic>and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an affliction</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn968">82</xref></sup> means that it is a great affliction which will not be healed [easily], but instead will grow the whole day and spread [into the skin] as it has done till now.</p>
<p>As to that which Rashi stated [in Verse 3 before us] that: &#x201C;It is a Scriptural ordinance [the reason of which is not known] that hair that has become white is a symptom of impurity&#x201D; &#x2014; <italic>this is the interpretation of the thing;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn969">83</xref></sup> <italic>it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn970">84</xref></sup> that person, for a plague which does not turn the hair white, is only an ugly spot in the skin, but not a secretion which will cause any sickness.</p>
<p>5. AND THE PRIEST SHALL LOOK AT HIM ON THE SEVENTH DAY, AND BEHOLD, IF THE PLAGUE STAY &#x2018;B&#x2019;EINAV.&#x2019; &#x201C;This means in its original color and size.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn971">85</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Similarly, <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;eino&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and the appearance thereof</italic>) <italic>was as the appearance of bdellium;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn972">86</xref></sup> and so also, <italic>&#x2018;k&#x2019;ein&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>like the color of</italic>) <italic>the crystal ice</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn973">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>But in the Torath Kohanim we have been taught as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn974">88</xref></sup> &#x201C;[From the expression here] I know only that the plague so appeared [i.e., in its original size] in his own [i.e., the priest&#x2019;s] eyes. Whence do I know that the same law applies if it so appeared in the eyes of his pupil? Scripture therefore says [in Verse 27]. <italic>But if the scall stay &#x2018;b&#x2019;einav.&#x2019;</italic> &#x201D; Now if so, the meaning of the verse here would be: &#x201C;and if the plague is at a stay in the sight of the aforementioned priest,&#x201D; namely that it has remained as it was, neither having changed its place nor having spread in the skin, wheresoever the priest looks [then he shall shut him up for another seven days]. The usage [of the term <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic> (eye)] is often found in the words of the Sages.<sup><xref rid="fn975">89</xref></sup> Thus: &#x201C;So it appears in my eyes.&#x201D; So also you find [in Scripture]: <italic>O man of G-d, I pray thee, let my life be precious &#x2018;b&#x2019;einecha&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>in thy sight</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn976">90</xref></sup> meaning, in your opinion and thought. Thus the verse here alludes to the principle that the priest in examining whether the plague has extended in the skin need only judge it as he sees it, but it is not necessary that [he base his decision] upon measuring the plague.</p>
<p>6. AND THE PRIEST SHALL SEE HIM A SECOND TIME THE SEVENTH DAY, AND BEHOLD, IF THE PLAGUE BE &#x2018;KEIHAH&#x2019; (DIM), AND THE PLAGUE BE NOT SPREAD IN THE SKIN, THE PRIEST SHALL PRONOUNCE HIM CLEAN. Rashi commented: &#x201C;<italic>Keihah</italic> means it has become paler<sup><xref rid="fn977">91</xref></sup> than its [former] color. [This allows the inference] that if the plague remains in its former color and has not extended in the skin, he is impure.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This indeed is the sense of the verse.<sup><xref rid="fn978">92</xref></sup> But the interpretation of our Rabbis is not so, for we have been taught in the Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn979">93</xref></sup> &#x201C;To cause to be put in quarantine [for a second week] such a plague which continues unchanged at the end of the first week; to pronounce pure such a plague which continues unchanged by the end of the second week.&#x201D; And in the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis have expressly said<sup><xref rid="fn980">94</xref></sup> that in the case of garments, if the plague is at a stay at the end of the first week, they are to be put in quarantine [for a second week], and if it be at a stay at the end of the second week, they are to be burnt; but in the case of a person, if the plague be at a stay at the end of the first week the priest is to put him in quarantine for another week, but if at the end of the second week it is still at a stay he is to pronounce him pure. And in Tractate Megillah the Rabbis have further said:<sup><xref rid="fn981">95</xref></sup> &#x201C;This excludes a leper who has been put in quarantine for a week, whose state of leprosy is determined not by his bodily condition, but merely by days.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn982">96</xref></sup> Now if it were necessary that the plague should become dim, then his purity <italic>would</italic> be dependent upon his bodily condition&#x0021; Rashi himself explained it there in such language, saying that the leper&#x2019;s purity is not dependent on the physical state of the plague, for if at the end of seven days a symptom of impurity &#x2014; white hair or extension of the plague &#x2014; is not found, the priest is to pronounce him pure although the plague has stayed in its appearance, that is at the end of the second week.<sup><xref rid="fn983">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rather, this is what the Sages said:<sup><xref rid="fn984">98</xref></sup> at the end of the second week, whether the plague has paled from the color of snow to [the shade of white of] the lime used in the Sanctuary, or like the white of an egg&#x2019;s membrane, or even if it has become stronger, namely, that it was at first like the lime [used in the Sanctuary] and then [at the end of the second week] it had become bright-white like snow, and all the more so if it remained in its original color &#x2014; as long as it did not spread in the skin, the priest pronounces it pure. If so, the interpretation of this verse is as follows: &#x201C;<italic>if the plague be &#x2018;keihah,&#x2019;</italic> meaning that it has turned into the color of another plague, such as from that of snow to that of lime, since <italic>it has not spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is but a scab</italic>.&#x201D; For in order that one should not say, &#x201C;since the plague has changed into the color of another plague it must be inspected from anew,&#x201D; Scripture therefore expressly taught that he is deemed pure. The same law applies if the color became stronger, since Scripture has already taught you that a change from color to color is not a symptom of impurity, but rather is considered as if it is at a stay, and as long as it did not spread in the skin [the afflicted person] is pure. Should you ask: &#x201C;But why did Scripture not mention expressly the case of a change to a stronger color [as being pure], and we would know that this is all the more so if it became paler?&#x201D; [The answer is that Scripture] came to teach you that although it became paler, if it spread in the skin he is nevertheless impure. Now the meaning of the word <italic>keihah</italic> is that the plague has become paler, changing to one of the colors of leprosy-signs, such as from that of snow to that of an egg&#x2019;s membrane, which can still be a leprosy-sign. But if it has become paler than the colors of leprosy-signs, in that case the person is already healed, and there is no longer a plague; thus even a spreading thereof no longer renders him impure at all. In a similar manner to this presentation has it been explained in the Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn984">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND THE PRIEST SHALL SEE, AND, BEHOLD, IF THERE BE A WHITE RISING IN THE SKIN, AND IT HAVE TURNED THE HAIR WHITE, AND THERE BE QUICK RAW FLESH IN THE RISING. The meaning of this verse is not that it is necessary for both to be present, namely, the white hair and the quick flesh [before the afflicted person is declared impure], since in the first section Scripture declared him impure because of white hair alone;<sup><xref rid="fn985">99</xref></sup> similarly, the appearance of the live flesh alone is a symptom of impurity. If so, the meaning of the verse is: &#x201C;<italic>and it have turned the hair white</italic>, or <italic>there be quick raw flesh in the rising</italic>.&#x201D; It mentions here white hair in the case of <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> (rising) although it stated it already in the case of <italic>bahereth</italic> (bright spot),<sup><xref rid="fn986">100</xref></sup> in order to teach us that in the case of both colors white hair is a symptom of impurity. Our Rabbis have explained<sup><xref rid="fn987">101</xref></sup> that the reason [why white hair is mentioned here when it has already been said above that it is a symptom of impurity] is in order to establish the minimum size of the quick flesh [mentioned here], that it must be large enough to contain the white hair, [the smallest number implied] being two.</p>
<p>12. AND IF THE LEPROSY BREAK OUT ABROAD IN THE SKIN, AND THE LEPROSY COVER ALL THE SKIN OF THE PLAGUE<sup><xref rid="fn988">102</xref></sup> FROM HIS HEAD EVEN TO HIS FOOT &#x2026; [HE IS CLEAN]. Now the breaking out of the leprosy is not deemed a symptom of purity, until it spreads over the entire body, except for the places which the Sages enumerated in the Mishnah,<sup><xref rid="fn989">103</xref></sup> which do not prevent a person who has turned completely white [from being pronounced pure]. If so, what is the meaning of the phrase <italic>all the skin of the plague</italic> [which would indicate that only the area of the plague need be turned white]? Rather, the meaning thereof is as follows: &#x201C;<italic>and the leprosy cover all the skin of the plague</italic> and <italic>from his head even to his foot</italic>.&#x201D; Scripture is thus stating that the place of the plague and the whole body have turned white, but if the whole body has become white, and the appearance of [the area of] the plague has turned to <italic>bohak</italic><sup><xref rid="fn990">104</xref></sup> or it became healed, the person is impure.</p>
<p>29. IF A MAN OR WOMAN HATH AN AFFLICTION UPON THE HEAD OR THE BEARD. &#x201C;Scripture intends to differentiate between a plague which is on a place where hair grows, and a plague on the flesh, for as regarding a plague on the flesh the symptom of impurity is white hair, while the symptom of a plague on a place where the hair grows is gold-colored hair &#x2014; that the black hair has turned into gold-colored. 30. &#x2018;NETHEK HU&#x2019; (IT IS A SCALL). This is the name of the plague on a place where hair grows.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>It would appear from this language that the difference between a plague upon the head or beard and a plague in the skin of the flesh, is that which Rashi mentioned, namely, the white hair and the gold-colored; thus if a plague occurs in any of its four colors<sup><xref rid="fn991">105</xref></sup> in a place where hair grows upon the head or beard, and if the hair became gold-colored, then the person is impure, just as he is impure if the hair turned white in a plague on the skin of the flesh. But how is it possible to say so&#x0021; Rashi himself has written [further on]: &#x201C;<italic>As the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn992">106</xref></sup> [It is like the color of the leprosy which is mentioned in the section dealing with plagues of the skin of the flesh, namely] that it makes one impure by means of any of the four white colors,<sup><xref rid="fn991">105</xref></sup> and it is not to be treated like the color of the <italic>nethakim</italic> (scalls) on the place where hair grows, which do not render a person impure by reason of the four colors: the <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> and its secondary shade, and <italic>bahereth</italic> and its secondary shade&#x0021;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn993">107</xref></sup> Now if [a <italic>nethek</italic>] does not render the person impure by means of one of these four colors,<sup><xref rid="fn991">105</xref></sup> then by what color and under what condition <italic>does</italic> it render one impure? Scripture has mentioned only the signs necessary for declaring him <italic>absolutely</italic> impure, namely, if gold-colored hair appeared in the <italic>nethek</italic> or spreading thereof took place<sup><xref rid="fn994">108</xref></sup> [but, according to Rashi, Scripture has left unspecified what color the <italic>nethek</italic> must be originally, in order that it be subject to inspection]&#x0021; Indeed, it seems that the Rabbi [Rashi] thought Scripture informed us of the name of the plague upon the head or beard by stating <italic>&#x2018;nethek hu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>it is a scall</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn995">109</xref></sup> meaning that this is its particular name, the designation by which it is recognized. Thus Scripture mentioned in the case of the plagues [in the skin of the flesh] their names and their colors, namely, <italic>&#x2018;bahereth l&#x2019;vanah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a bright spot which is white</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn996">110</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;se&#x2019;eith l&#x2019;vanah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a white rising</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn997">111</xref></sup> and in the case of the head it also mentioned its name [namely, <italic>nethek</italic>], for by that designation it is known, and that name indeed Scripture declared to be impure, and then it went back and explained the symptoms [of the <italic>nethek</italic>] for the person to be declared absolutely impure at the end [i.e., after he had been put in quarantine for a week]. This is the Rabbi&#x2019;s [Rashi&#x2019;s] opinion on the <italic>nethek</italic> (scall).</p>
<p>This interpretation of Rashi&#x2019;s opinion is further borne out by his words when he said that the sense of the following section, <italic>And the man whose hair is fallen off his head</italic><sup><xref rid="fn998">112</xref></sup> is to say that if a man&#x2019;s hair falls off his head and he becomes bald, <italic>he is clean</italic>; that is, &#x201C;he is clean from the impurity of <italic>nethakim</italic> (scalls in a hair-spot) on the head,&#x201D; and he is no longer rendered impure by the kind of plague called <italic>nethek</italic>, but instead he is subject to the laws of a plague on the skin of the flesh, [namely] <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> and its secondary shade, for since there is no hair there [after becoming bald] he is excluded from the law applying to the head or the beard.</p>
<p>But all this is not so. For as long as the head or beard contain hair, they do not render the person impure at all by means of any of the colors of leprosy [since they are not &#x201C;the skin of the body&#x201D;]. But when baldness affects a certain part of the head, the hair falling out from its very roots, and that place becomes smooth and clear of any hair, and then there grows in that baldness <italic>a gold-colored thin hair</italic><sup><xref rid="fn995">109</xref></sup> &#x2014; that is the impure plague [dealt with here]. It is for that reason that it is called <italic>nethek</italic> [of the root <italic>nothak</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;to tear away&#x201D;] because the hair has become removed from there, and it is not merely a name, as the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote. Rather, <italic>for as his name is, so is he</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn999">113</xref></sup> for [in order that the law of <italic>nethek</italic> should apply], it is necessary that the hair falls out [on the head or the beard] in a place [at least] the size of a bean, and after the natural falling out of this first hair from that place, if that gold-colored &#x201C;afflicted&#x201D; hair springs up, it is a symptom of impurity. This does not apply if the gold-colored hair come there before the baldness. So also we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn1000">114</xref></sup> &#x201C;If [<italic>a bahereth</italic>] appeared on the head or the beard,<sup><xref rid="fn1001">115</xref></sup> and then the head or the beard became bald, they are pure. If it were on the head or the beard before these grew hair, and they then grew hair and again became bald, Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov declares them impure, since both in the beginning and at the end they were impure. But the Sages declare them to be pure.&#x201D; And with regards to gold-colored hair which precede [the <italic>nethek</italic>] we have also been taught in a Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn1002">116</xref></sup> &#x201C;If gold-colored hair preceded the <italic>nethek</italic> (scall) it is pure. Rabbi Yehudah declares it impure. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: It neither renders the person impure, nor does it afford him protection.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1003">117</xref></sup> This whole topic is similarly taught also in the Sifra.<sup><xref rid="fn1004">118</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reason why Scripture does not mention &#x201C;the baldness&#x201D; at first [but instead begins Verse 29 before us by stating: <italic>If a man or woman hath an affliction upon the head or the beard</italic>], is because it mentioned with reference to the plague on the head or beard a &#x201C;deep appearance&#x201D; and &#x201C;gold-colored hair,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn995">109</xref></sup> and it is impossible that the appearance thereof should be deep in the same way that the color of the sun appears deeper than the shadow, as long as a person&#x2019;s black natural hair is still upon him. Therefore Scripture spoke about the customary way of people, for when plagues come upon their head, [that part of the head] first becomes bald, and then a plague arises in the baldness, in which the thin short gold-colored hair grows. Then [in Verse 30] Scripture explains <italic>&#x2018;nethek hu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>it is a scall</italic>), in order to make it quite clear that he is not to be declared impure unless there was a baldness.</p>
<p>Now in the opinion of most commentators<sup><xref rid="fn1005">119</xref></sup> this plague, namely, the <italic>nethek</italic>, need not have a <italic>bahereth</italic> (a bright spot) or <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> (rising) nor their subsidiary species,<sup><xref rid="fn993">107</xref></sup> nor any change of appearance in the skin of the head, but as soon as the hair fell out from a spot the size of a bean on the head or beard, and is entirely uprooted from its roots, that is the plague, and if thin gold-colored hair appears in it, the person is impure. This is <italic>the leprosy of the head or of the beard</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn995">109</xref></sup> For Scripture first declared the person impure <italic>if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and there be in it gold-colored thin hair</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn995">109</xref></sup> and then it mentioned that if <italic>the appearance thereof is not deeper than the skin</italic>, that the plague must be shut up for a week;<sup><xref rid="fn1006">120</xref></sup> then it declared him to be impure if [after this week] the <italic>nethek</italic> spread in the skin,<sup><xref rid="fn1007">121</xref></sup> the sense thereof being that [in the case of the spreading of the <italic>nethek</italic>] the appearance thereof need not be deeper than the skin, nor different in any way [for him to be declared impure]. Now surely these two symptoms [of impurity in the <italic>nethek</italic>], namely, spreading of the plague and appearance of gold-colored hair, are alike in their laws. If so, the verses intend to teach us that whether the appearance of the <italic>nethek</italic> is as deep as the appearance of a <italic>bahereth</italic>, or whether it is not as deep or is not different in any way [from the rest of the skin], as soon as the baldness occurs, the person is rendered impure if gold-colored hair appears in it or if the <italic>nethek</italic> spreads in the skin. There are many Beraithoth<sup><xref rid="fn1008">122</xref></sup> in the Sifra<sup><xref rid="fn1008">122</xref></sup> taught on this subject.</p>
<p>Yet [despite all this] it would appear that after the hair falls off from a spot on the head, it is not to be deemed a plague until a <italic>bahereth</italic> or its subsidiary species appears in that bald spot, or a <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> or its subsidiary species,<sup><xref rid="fn993">107</xref></sup> and then the <italic>bahereth</italic> or <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> renders the person impure if it grows gold-colored hair, just [as the <italic>bahereth</italic> or <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic>] render impure if in the skin of the flesh the black hair has turned white.<sup><xref rid="fn1009">123</xref></sup> For our verse which mentions <italic>an affliction upon the head or the beard</italic>, and then states, <italic>and, behold, if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn995">109</xref></sup> is alluding to the colors of the plagues previously mentioned,<sup><xref rid="fn991">105</xref></sup> meaning specifically <italic>bahereth</italic> and its subsidiaries and also <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> and its subsidiaries.<sup><xref rid="fn993">107</xref></sup> And this section is singled out in order to be made the subject of a special statement not similar to the general proposition, namely, that the colors of the plagues on the head do not render a person impure until the hair has fallen off. The effect of this is sometimes a more lenient ruling, and sometimes a more stringent one. The more lenient ruling is that they do not render the person impure by means of white hair, and the more stringent one is that he is to be pronounced impure by reason of the gold-colored hair. And the interpretation of the verse, <italic>And if the priest see the plague of the scall, and, behold, the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up</italic> [<italic>him that hath</italic>] <italic>the plague of the scall seven days</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1006">120</xref></sup> is similar to that mentioned above [in the section dealing with the plagues of the skin of the flesh]: <italic>And if &#x2018;bahereth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the bright spot</italic>) <italic>be white in the skin of the flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn996">110</xref></sup> for the expression <italic>&#x2018;nega hanethek&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the plague of the scall</italic>) [here in Verse 31] alludes to the principle that the [four] colors of the &#x201C;plagues&#x201D; apply to the <italic>nethek</italic> as well.</p>
<p>This matter requires further study of the Tosephta<sup><xref rid="fn1010">124</xref></sup> to Tractate Negaim. For we have been taught there as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn1011">125</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Nethakim</italic> (scalls) cause impurity in all colors, even white on black or black on white, and they cause impurity by means of thin yellow hair which appears to be gold-colored.&#x201D; Thus far [is the language of the Tosephta]. It would appear from this text that there has to be in the bald part some [distinguishing] color of a plague, either white on the skin of a black-haired man, like the [four] colors of plagues, or even a black plague on the skin of a white-haired man, like &#x201C;the black <italic>murphia</italic>&#x201D; which doctors mention, since Scripture always speaks of <italic>&#x2018;nega hanethek&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the plague of the scall</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1006">120</xref></sup> indicating that there has to be a plague in the <italic>nethek</italic>, but it did not specify any colors for them as it did in the case of [the plagues of] the skin of the flesh. And the second section, <italic>And the man whose hair is fallen off his head</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn998">112</xref></sup> teaches that the law of <italic>nethakim</italic> applies only if the hair falls off the middle of the head, and hair remains surrounding the <italic>nethek</italic> on all sides. But if the hair falls off from the back of the head, or towards the face, and that whole side becomes bald [and a plague appeared therein], its status is not to be determined by the symptoms of impurity of the head or beard [namely, gold-colored hair or the spreading of the <italic>nethek</italic>], but rather by the symptoms of plagues of the skin of the flesh [namely, the appearance of white hair or the spreading of the plague or quick flesh]. The reason for this [distinction between the various locations of the baldness of the head] is that it is in the nature of many people that some of their hair at the sides of the head, in the back or in front becomes bald, and the falling off of the hair there is no sign of sickness, but instead is like the rest of the body. But when the hair falls off from the middle of the head, the place where there normally is hair, it can only be a plague which caused it, that plague in our language being termed <italic>tinim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1012">126</xref></sup> and in Arabic it is called <italic>al sa&#x2019;afah</italic>. Accordingly Scripture excluded from this law hair which falls out from the front of his head and the back, since it is usual for people to become bald at those places. And the verse which states, <italic>But if there be &#x2018;bakarachath&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>in the bald towards the back of the head</italic>), <italic>or &#x2018;bagabachath&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the bald forehead</italic>), <italic>a reddish-white plague</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1013">127</xref></sup> means that these parts of the head convey impurity as does the rest of the body &#x2014; by the [four] colors of plagues whether there is a reddish mixture in the white or it be a plain white. Scripture further states <italic>as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn992">106</xref></sup> This means that [if there is baldness towards the back of the head or the forehead] he is also certified absolutely as impure by quick flesh or the spreading of the plague, which is &#x201C;the appearance of leprosy&#x201D; that is certified absolutely as impure in plagues of the skin of the flesh. Now our Rabbis have mentioned that it is not certified as impure by means of white hair, just as we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup><xref rid="fn1014">128</xref></sup> &#x201C;Quick flesh causes impurity <italic>bakarachath</italic> (in baldness towards the back of the head), or <italic>bagabachath</italic> (baldness in the forehead), whereas it is not so with the white hair.&#x201D; It is also so expressed in the Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn1015">129</xref></sup></p>
<p>But some of the commentators<sup><xref rid="fn1016">130</xref></sup> stated that the sense of the Scriptural sections is to differentiate between a person afflicted with a <italic>nethek</italic> [which is discussed in Verses 29-37] and with baldness [as mentioned in Verses 40-44]; and the meaning of the matter is that <italic>karachath</italic> and <italic>gabachath</italic> both denote plucking out of the hair in such a manner that it will never grow again, such as where he applied a certain ointment to the hair of his head which caused it to fall out, or where it fell out at its roots naturally, when the moisture [feeding it] dried up. Thus the meaning of this section according to this opinion is that at first Scripture spoke [in Verses 29-37] of <italic>nethek</italic>, which is a falling off or cutting of the hair, similar to the expressions: <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;nathuk v&#x2019;charuth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>or torn off, or cut</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn1017">131</xref></sup> <italic>as soon as the soles of the priests&#x2019; feet &#x2018;nithku&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>were drawn up</italic>) <italic>unto the dry ground</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1018">132</xref></sup> Then Scripture states [in Verses 40-44] that if the head be <italic>yimareit</italic>, meaning that the hair was plucked out by force, thus leaving the bald and shiny <italic>like burnished brass</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1019">133</xref></sup> similar to that which is written, <italic>it is furbished that it may glitter</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1020">134</xref></sup> which as is known will never grow hair again &#x2014; that is not a <italic>nethek</italic>, but rather this man <italic>&#x2018;keireiach hu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he is bald in the back of his head</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1021">135</xref></sup> or <italic>gibeiach hu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he is bald near his forehead</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1022">136</xref></sup> as other people who are bald, and <italic>he is clean</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1023">137</xref></sup>. But if there be in this baldness towards the back or front of the head one of the [four] colors of plagues<sup><xref rid="fn991">105</xref></sup>, he will be subject to the same law of impurity as is the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh, and through their symptoms, namely, quick flesh and the spreading of the plague in the skin [after having been shut up for a week]; except that the Sages in their interpretation excluded from [these symptoms of impurity] white hair [which in the skin of the flesh <italic>is</italic> a sign of impurity but not in baldness towards the back or front of the head]. The reason for this is that the hair of the head has been plucked out in such a way that it will never grow again, and even if a few hair appear by chance, they will never be black [so that they could through turning white on account of the plague, serve as a sign of impurity], nor will they have the characteristics of hair, but they will be merely some weak form thereof and white. This is the opinion of the French scholars in the commentary to Tractate Negaim.<sup><xref rid="fn1016">130</xref></sup> The sense of the Mishnayoth and Beraithoth taught there [in that tractate] tend to support their words. If so, <italic>nethek</italic> [mentioned in Verses 29-37] is the sickness [called in Arabic] <italic>sa&#x2019;afah</italic> [as stated above], or the well-known sicknesses called &#x201C;the sickness of the fox,&#x201D; and &#x201C;the path of the snake,&#x201D; all these being forms of sickness which can be remedied [so that the hair grows again]; but &#x201C;the plucking out&#x201D; of the hair [mentioned in Verses 40-44] is a form of baldness for which there is no help or remedy at all.</p>
<p>33. THEN SHALL HE BE SHAVEN, BUT &#x2018;V&#x2019;ETH HANETHEK&#x2019; (THE SCALL) SHALL HE NOT SHAVE. In line with the plain meaning of Scripture the verse warns that he should not use a razor on the place of the <italic>nethek</italic>, for even though there is no hair on it, yet if he passes the razor over it the skin will be scratched causing hair to grow in it; for such is the nature of people who have scabs on their heads, and all those who make their hair to fall off, to scratch the place on the head and also to make certain cuts in it with a knife.</p>
<p>But in the Torath Kohanim the Sages interpreted the verse as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn1024">138</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>But the &#x2018;nethek&#x2019; shall he not shave</italic>. But what is there to shave there?&#x201D; That is to say, has not the hair fallen off from it? [So what need is there for Scripture to warn him not to shave it?] &#x201C;Rather, the verse means, <italic>around</italic> the <italic>nethek</italic> he is not to shave. How can we explain this? He shaves the space outside it, but leaves [a circle] of two hairs [width] next to the <italic>nethek</italic>, so that it should be possible to discern if it spreads.&#x201D; It is this which Onkelos translated: &#x201C;and he shall shave around the scall, and that which is within the scall he shall not shave,&#x201D; for he is to leave on all its sides a row of two hairs in order to recognize [at the end of seven days] if the <italic>nethek</italic> has spread [in which case the priest will pronounce him impure]. And the meaning of the word <italic>v&#x2019;eth</italic> [<italic>v&#x2019;eth hanethek</italic>] is then like the expression, <italic>and David came near &#x2018;eth&#x2019; the people, and he saluted them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1025">139</xref></sup> which means that he came near them but he did not enter into their midst. [Here too it would mean, &#x201C;and &#x2018;in&#x2019; the <italic>nethek</italic> itself he shall not shave.&#x201D;] Or it may be that the meaning of <italic>v&#x2019;eth</italic> is like <italic>im</italic> (with), with the word <italic>asher</italic> (which) missing, the verse thus stating: &#x201C;and that [i.e., the hair] which is &#x2018;with&#x2019; the <italic>nethek</italic> he shall not shave.&#x201D; There are many such cases in Scripture.</p>
<p>47. AND WHEN THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IS IN A GARMENT. This is not in the natural order of things, nor does it ever happen in the world [outside Israel], and similarly leprosy of houses<sup><xref rid="fn1026">140</xref></sup> [is not a natural phenomenon]. But when Israel is wholly devoted to G-d, then His spirit is upon them always, to maintain their bodies, clothes and houses in a good appearance. Thus as soon as one of them commits a sin or transgression, a deformity appears in his flesh, or on his garment, or in his house, revealing that G-d has turned aside from him. It is for this reason that Scripture states, <italic>And I shall put the plague of leprosy in a house of the Land of your possession</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1027">141</xref></sup> meaning that it is G-d&#x2019;s punishment upon that house. Thus [the law of leprosy of houses] applies only in the Land which is <italic>the inheritance of the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1028">142</xref></sup> even as He said, <italic>When ye are come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1027">141</xref></sup> Now the reason [why this law does not apply outside the Land of Israel] is not because it is a duty which attaches to the ground<sup><xref rid="fn1029">143</xref></sup>, but the reason is because this matter [of Divine indication of sins] occurs only in the Chosen Land, wherein the Glorious Name dwells. And in the Torath Kohanim the Sages further interpreted<sup><xref rid="fn1030">144</xref></sup> that a house does not contract impurity until after the conquest and division [of the Land by Israel], and until after each and every individual clearly knows his portion. The reason for this law is that only then do they have the ease of mind to know the Eternal, and the Divine Glory dwells among them. I think similarly with reference to the law of leprosy in garments, that it applies only in the Land [of Israel], it being unnecessary to exclude [the application of this law] in places outside the Land, since they never occur there. For this reason also the law of leprosy in garments applies only to white garments, not to colored ones, because the color might perhaps have extracted this unclean phenomenon [i.e., the leprosy] in that place [in the garment] in a natural way, and it will then not be regarded as <italic>a finger of G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1031">145</xref></sup> Therefore garments colored by Heaven can contract impurity, according to the words of Rabbi Shimon.<sup><xref rid="fn1032">146</xref></sup> And by way of the simple meaning of Scripture, the reason why it repeats in every verse the expression &#x201C;<italic>the garment, or the skin, or the wrap and the woof</italic>,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1033">147</xref></sup> is because the matter is miraculous. Our Rabbis have interpretations for them [i.e., these repetitions], and all of them are found in the Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn1034">148</xref></sup></p>
<p>52. FOR IT IS A LEPROSY THAT IS &#x2018;MAM&#x2019;ERETH&#x2019; (FRETTING). &#x201C;<italic>Mam&#x2019;ereth</italic> is an expression of <italic>&#x2018;silon mam&#x2019;ir&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a pricking brier</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1035">149</xref></sup> The Midrashic interpretation is:<sup><xref rid="fn1036">150</xref></sup> attach a <italic>me&#x2019;eirah</italic> (curse) to it &#x2014; so that you will have no benefit from it.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And Onkelos translated: &#x201C;a leprosy that is <italic>mechasra</italic> (pricking).&#x201D; This interpretation he also derived from <italic>&#x2018;silon mam&#x2019;ir&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a pricking brier</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1035">149</xref></sup> for in Aramaic any shrub which causes a pricking pain is called <italic>chisra</italic>. Thus: &#x201C;<italic>k&#x2019;chizra</italic> (as a thorn) in a ball of wool;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1037">151</xref></sup> &#x201C;take thy good-natured advice and throw it over <italic>achizri</italic> (the hedge).&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1038">152</xref></sup> And the truth of the matter is that <italic>mam&#x2019;ereth</italic> is indeed an expression of curse, that it is to say, it is G-d&#x2019;s curse upon the garment and house, as I have mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1039">153</xref></sup> But the Midrash which states that it is forbidden to derive any benefit from it [a leprous garment] is based [not on the word <italic>mam&#x2019;ereth</italic> as Rashi had it, but] on the redundancy of expression.<sup><xref rid="fn1040">154</xref></sup> The same law applies to a leprous house, and it is derived from the verse, <italic>And he shall break down the house</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1041">155</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus also I have found in the Talmud Yerushalmi of Tractate Orlah:<sup><xref rid="fn1042">156</xref></sup> &#x201C;If stones were removed from a house affected with leprosy and made into plaster, some Rabbis taught that they become free of their impurity, and some taught that they do not become free of their impurity. Those who said that they become free, are also of the opinion that they may now be used [for some benefit], and those who say that they do not become free are also of the opinion that they are still forbidden [to be made use of], for it is written: <italic>it is a leprosy that is &#x2018;mam&#x2019;ereth&#x2019;</italic>, meaning, attach a curse to it and derive no benefit from it. Rabbi Abohu said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: All things which must be burnt, one may derive benefit from their ashes, except for the ashes of an idol. Rabbi Chiya the son of Yosei asked Rabbi Yochanan: &#x2018;There is the case of the ashes of a house [affected with leprosy], which is not related to idolatry, and yet you say that the ashes thereof are forbidden for any use [like the stones which have been turned into lime or plaster]&#x0021; Said Rabbi Yochanan to him: &#x2018;This is different,&#x2019; since [concerning a house affected with leprosy] it is written that it be &#x2018;broken down.&#x2019; &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1043">157</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn887">(1) Ramban is clarifying Rashi&#x2019;s words and saying that Rashi did not refer to a case where the abortion was a foetus filled with water, for in that event the mother does not become impure for the days prescribed for a male or for a female child.

For the next thirty-three days, even though she has an issue of blood, she is permitted to her husband, but she may not eat of the offerings nor come into the Sanctuary until the forty-first day, when she brings her prescribed offerings (Verses 6-8). For a female child the number of impure days are fourteen, and the waiting period until she may eat of the offerings etc. is sixty-six days, and she brings her offerings on the eighty-first day. &#x2014; It should be pointed out that this is the <italic>Scriptural</italic> law which explains the verses and the text of Ramban before us.

Rather, immediately after she has not seen blood following the seven-days for a male-child and fourteen for a female, and after she counted a further seven <italic>clean</italic> days, she is permitted to her husband. But if she again saw even a drop of blood as tiny as a grain of mustard, she is unclean. For although by Scriptural law it is clean blood, yet the custom has already been accepted in all Israel that no coition is permitted if there is clean blood, the law applicable thereto being in every respect like that of other [unclean] blood&#x201D; (Yoreh Deah 194:1, Rama).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn918">(32) It is important to clarify first certain basic <italic>Scriptural</italic> concepts in order to understand the text before us: (a) Commencing with the day on which a woman first sees a menstrual issue, she is to count seven days of impurity. During these days she remains impure, and forbidden to her husband, whether or not she sees another issue in the course of them. The issue, however, having ceased before the sun has set on the seventh day, she is to immerse herself that night in a ritual pool and may enter into conjugal relations. [However, for the Rabbinic ordinance as observed today, see Note 35.] (b) After these seven days of impurity effecting the menstruant, commences &#x201C;the eleven-day period&#x201D; (here referred to in the text) during which she becomes subject to the law affecting the <italic>zavah</italic> (a woman suffering a flux outside her regular period). That is to say, if during this period she sees one or two issues on the same day or on two consecutive days, she only has to immerse herself in a ritual pool on the following day, and returns to her purity with the setting of the sun. A woman suffering a flux of this kind is often referred to as &#x201C;a minor <italic>zavah</italic>.&#x201D; If, however, during the eleven-day period she sees one or more issues on three consecutive days, she becomes &#x201C;a major <italic>zavah</italic>,&#x201D; being under the obligation to count seven &#x201C;clean days&#x201D; after the complete cessation of the flux. And if in the course of these seven &#x201C;clean days,&#x201D; she sees another issue, she is to commence counting seven &#x201C;clean days&#x201D; anew. With the completion of the counting of seven completely &#x201C;clean days,&#x201D; the major <italic>zavah</italic> is to immerse herself in a ritual pool, bringing on the following day the prescribed offering (further, 15:29-30). Thus it is clear that by ordinance of the Torah, the law of the menstruant is far different from that of the <italic>zavah</italic>, to which she is subject during &#x201C;the eleven-day&#x201D; period, or the intervening time between her regular periods. See additionally, Note 35 as to the Rabbinic ordinance.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn919">(33) Thus a woman who was in protracted labor for <italic>three</italic> days of this &#x201C;eleven-day period&#x201D; [during which ordinarily the laws of <italic>zivah</italic> would have applied], and she saw issues on these three consecutive days, is yet <italic>not</italic> subject to this law. But, as the text continues, if she was in hard labor during her seven days of menstruation and she saw an issue, she is impure as a menstruant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn920">(34) See above, Note 32 (a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn921">(35) It is important to note that by Rabbinic ordinance a woman seeing an issue <italic>at any time whatever</italic>, is under obligation to count seven completely &#x201C;clean days&#x201D; after the cessation of the issue last seen &#x2014; irrespective of whether she has seen the last issue within the seven-day period, or at any time thereafter. She must then immerse herself in a ritual pool, whereupon she is considered purified, and may enter into conjugal relations &#x2014; the conditions attaching to the eating of hallowed food no longer of course being in force in our days because of the destruction of the Sanctuary and the absence of certain other means of ritual purification.</ftnote>

In other words, after she has completed the forty-day period for a male child and eighty days for a female &#x2014; whether the reason that the Torah decreed these days is as Ramban explained it, in accordance with the opinion of the Sages, or as Ibn Ezra explained it in accordance with that of Rabbi Yishmael (<italic>ibid.</italic>) &#x2014; she shall then bring etc.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn931">(45) See Psalms 92:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn932">(46) Deuteronomy 21:5. The following is the law of plagues or leprosy, which is the subject of the coming sections: &#x201C;All are qualified to inspect the leprosy-signs, but only a priest may pronounce them impure or pure&#x201D; (Negaim 3:1). If the priest was unskilled in these laws, a learned person would tell him to say &#x201C;pure&#x201D; or &#x201C;impure&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). &#x2014; It should also be pointed out that while <italic>tzara&#x2019;ath</italic> is generally translated as &#x201C;leprosy&#x201D; and as such represents a <italic>physical</italic> disarray in the body of the person, in Jewish tradition it also carries with it <italic>a moral and spiritual</italic> meaning as illumined further on by Ramban in Verse 47.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn933">(47) Mechilta, at beginning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn934">(48) As it says in the case of the offerings (above, 1:2, and elsewhere).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn935">(49) Further, 14:1-2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn936">(50) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 15:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn937">(51) In view of the fact that decisions of purity and impurity in cases where a man or woman saw a flux was <italic>not</italic> dependent upon the pronouncement of the priest, unlike the law in cases of leprosy (see Note 46 above), Ramban&#x2019;s words must be understood in the following sense: Since the priest has occasion to perform the Service in the Sanctuary, and even when he is outside it, he may eat <italic>terumah</italic> (the heave-offering), which he is forbidden to eat when impure, therefore the Israelite who is suffering from a flux and thus rendered impure must let the priest know of his condition, so that he should not be defiled on account of him. See my Hebrew commentary, Vol. II, p. 534 (beginning with the fifth edition).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn945">(59) Isaiah 2:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn946">(60) This means as follows: The two principal colors of leprosy-sign are <italic>bahereth</italic> and <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic>. To each of these two colors Scripture has added a <italic>sapachath</italic> &#x2014; a second shade of it. Thus the number of colors is four. See further, Notes 105 and 107, for the precise nature of these colors and their gradations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn947">(61) Verse 4. At this point it is necessary to explain some of the basic principles on which the following discussions of Ramban in this whole section of <italic>Tazria</italic> are based: (a) Any of the four colors of white (see Note 105) which appears <italic>in the skin of the flesh</italic>, does not of itself render the person impure, unless in addition it has one of the three symptoms of impurity, which are: if the plague has turned a minimum of two black hairs in the white patch in the flesh to white, or some &#x201C;quick flesh&#x201D; has appeared in the middle of the plague, or, if not having had one of these symptoms to begin with, the person was shut up for seven days, and then it was seen that the white patch of the plague had spread in the skin. (b) If any of these four colors appear in a place where there was an inflammation or a burning inflammation, the person is rendered impure only by means of one of these two symptoms: hair changing color from black to white, or the spreading of the white patch of the plague in the skin. The appearance of &#x201C;quick flesh&#x201D; in this case is <italic>not</italic> a sign of impurity. (c) If a plague appears in the hair, the symptoms of impurity are one of two: if the plague has caused a minimum of two hairs to turn gold-colored, or if it has spread in the skin. (d) A special lengthy discussion appears in Ramban (further in Verse 29) as to the precise nature of the plague which the Torah calls <italic>nethek</italic> (Verse 30), and which laws regulate it. Other laws pertinent to these discussions are clearly set forth in the text. Finally, it should be noted that a person shut up or quarantined for a week by the priest is rendered unclean in every respect as a leper that is certified unclean, except that he need not go with unkempt hair and rent garments; also, if declared &#x201C;clean&#x201D; by the priest at the end of the week he need not do the cutting off of the hair and the bringing of the bird-offerings etc., as they are required of the leper that had been certified unclean when healed of his leprosy (see further Chapter 14) (Megillah 8 b).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn948">(62) Further, Verse 30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn949">(63) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn950">(64) Shebuoth 5 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn951">(65) Further in Verses 19-20 Scripture states: <italic>And in the place of the boil there is &#x2018;se&#x2019;eith l&#x2019;vanah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a white rising</italic>) <italic>or &#x2018;bahereth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a bright spot</italic>) <italic>&#x2026; and the priest shall look; and behold, if the appearance thereof be &#x2018;shaphal&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>lower</italic>) <italic>than the skin</italic>. Now the word <italic>shaphal</italic> (lower) refers obviously to both <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> and <italic>bahereth</italic> mentioned before. But according to Rashi, Ramban asks, why does it not state concerning the color of <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> that it is <italic>&#x2018;amok min ha&#x2019;or&#x2019;</italic> (&#x201C;deeper&#x201D; than the skin) instead of &#x201C;lower&#x201D; than the skin, when, as Rashi put it, &#x201C;Every white color is &#x2018;deeper&#x2019; [in contrast to the black surrounding it]?&#x201D; And here too (in Verse 3 before us) it merely says that <italic>the appearance of &#x2018;the plague&#x2019; be deeper</italic>, but it does not say so about the <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic>&#x0021;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn952">(66) Torath Kohanim <italic>Tazria</italic>, Negaim 1:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn953">(67) Thus we have explained the saying of the Rabbis that <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> signifies &#x201C;rising,&#x201D; for it is only in contrast to <italic>bahereth</italic> which is bright-white like snow, that the duller color of <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> appears &#x201C;higher.&#x201D; Thus there is no contradiction between this statement of the Rabbis and that which Rashi said, that &#x201C;Every white color is deep etc.,&#x201D; since the above interpretation of the Rabbis concerning <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> was with reference to a contrast of a still brighter color. It still remains to explain why Scripture does not speak of <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> as appearing &#x201C;deeper&#x201D; than the skin, but instead speaks of it as being &#x201C;lower&#x201D; than the skin (see Note 65 above). This point Ramban will now proceed to explain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn954">(68) Negaim 1:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn955">(69) This explains Verse 4 which states: <italic>And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin</italic> &#x2014; on which Rashi had commented, &#x201C;I do not know the meaning of this,&#x201D; for the reason explained above. Ramban explains it on the basis of physical laws of nature, that since the verse continues to state, <italic>and the hair thereof be not turned white</italic>, therefore the visionary power of the eye concentrates on the black hair, and from there it spreads forth to the white plague, and consequently the whiteness does not appear deeper than the skin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn956">(70) The color of <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic>, as mentioned above, is as white as white wool.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn957">(71) Further, Verse 19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn958">(72) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 20. At this point Ramban interprets the phrase quoted as referring back to both <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> and <italic>bahereth</italic>. Further on he will explain it as referring only to <italic>bahereth</italic>. See further, Note 73.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn959">(73) For since Ramban has explained above that it is <italic>not</italic> in the nature of every form of white to appear deeper than the skin [unlike Rashi who stated categorically, &#x201C;Every white color is deep etc.,&#x201D; as a result of which Rashi found it difficult to explain the phrase in Verse 4: <italic>and the appearance thereof be &#x2018;not&#x2019; deeper than the skin</italic>, as mentioned above] and since <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> is only as white as white wool, unlike the <italic>bahereth</italic> which is bright-white like snow, therefore Scripture does not speak of it as appearing &#x201C;lower&#x201D; than the skin. Instead, the phrase, <italic>behold, it be in sight &#x2018;lower&#x2019; than the skin</italic> (Verse 20) refers back only to the white <italic>bahereth</italic>. It is only according to Rashi who wrote that &#x201C;Every white color appears deeper etc.&#x201D; that the phrase in Verse 20, <italic>behold, it be in sight &#x2018;lower&#x2019;</italic> etc. refers back to both <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> and <italic>bahereth</italic> mentioned in Verse 19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn960">(74) Verse 21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn961">(75) Verse 24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn962">(76) Verse 25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn963">(77) Verse 26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn964">(78) <italic>And if the &#x2018;bahereth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>bright spot</italic>) <italic>stay in its place &#x2026; but it be dim &#x2026; the priest shall pronounce him clean</italic> (Verse 28).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn965">(79) Verses 2, 3, 9, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn966">(80) Verse 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn967">(81) Verse 25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn968">(82) Verse 22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn969">(83) Daniel 5:26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn970">(84) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 4:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn971">(85) The literal meaning of <italic>b&#x2019;einav</italic> is &#x201C;in his eyes,&#x201D; i.e., the eyes of the priest examining the plague. Ramban will further on stress this literal meaning of the word.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn972">(86) Numbers 11:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn973">(87) Ezekiel 1:22. These two verses bear out Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation of <italic>einav</italic> as meaning &#x201C;its appearance,&#x201D; thus making the sense of the verse to be: and, behold, <italic>if the plague stay &#x2018;in its appearance.&#x2019;</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn974">(88) Further, Verse 37. Thus if after having shut the person up in a house for seven days, the priest is in doubt whether the plague has spread [in which case he would pronounce it at once as a genuine case of leprosy], but his son or pupil who saw it at the beginning says definitely that the affliction did not spread, the priest may follow their opinion and may shut him up for another seven days. See my Hebrew commentary p. 70, for further discussion of this point.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn975">(89) The term <italic>chachamim</italic> (Sages) is evidently used by Ramban here not in the strict sense of the term, as referring to the Sages of the Talmud, as I have not found this expression in Talmudic literature. It must then be a reference to the later scholars in whose writings this expression abounds.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn976">(90) II Kings 1:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn977">(91) Since the term <italic>nega</italic> (plague) is masculine, and <italic>keihah</italic> (pale) is in the feminine, the word <italic>keihah</italic> cannot be an adjective to <italic>nega</italic> [meaning: &#x201C;if the plague is pale&#x201D;]. Instead, it must mean, as Rashi points out, &#x201C;if the plague <italic>has become</italic> pale,&#x201D; serving as a verb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn978">(92) For since the verse states two conditions for the priest&#x2019;s pronouncement that the person is pure &#x2014; namely, if the plague has become paler, and the plague be not spread in the skin &#x2014; it is obvious that if only the first condition has been met, but not the second, that the person is impure. This is the meaning of Ramban&#x2019;s comment on Rashi&#x2019;s statement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn979">(93) Negaim 1:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn980">(94) Torath Kohanim, Negaim 2:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn981">(95) Megillah 8 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn982">(96) &#x201C;For if on the seventh day the symptoms of impurity are not found in the plague, namely, the black hair in it has not turned white, or that the plague did not spread in the skin, the priest will pronounce him pure, even though the plague is still at a stay&#x201D; (Rashi, <italic>ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn983">(97) If the plague has stayed in its appearance at the end of the first week that the infected person was shut up, Verse 5 clearly states, <italic>then the priest shall shut him up seven days more</italic>. The discussion here relates only to the end of the second week.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn984">(98) Torath Kohanim, Negaim 2:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn985">(99) Above, Verse 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn986">(100) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn987">(101) Torath Kohanim, Negaim 3:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn988">(102) It is clear from Ramban&#x2019;s words further on, that he interpreted the Hebrew <italic>eth kol or hanega</italic> literally: &#x201C;all the skin of the plague.&#x201D; It is generally translated though: &#x201C;all the skin of him that hath the plague.&#x201D; As explained further, Ramban also understands the verse to apply only where the leprosy covered the whole body, while the expression <italic>all the skin of the plague</italic> serves to teach us some new matter, as stated in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn989">(103) Negaim 8:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn990">(104) Further, Verse 39. &#x201C;Lentil-like spots, and between the spots the flesh shows bright with a pure brightness&#x201D; (Rashi, <italic>ibid.</italic>). Now the verse there concludes that <italic>bohak</italic> is pure. But Ramban here points out that if the leprosy broke out and covered all the person&#x2019;s body, except that the original place of the plague turned into <italic>bohak</italic>, he is impure, since before the rule of the present verse applies, the leprosy must spread also to cover the skin of the plague. The same rule applies even if the skin of the plague became completely healed, as mentioned next in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn991">(105) The four colors of the plagues are: <italic>bahereth</italic> (bright-white like snow), <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic> (white as white wool); <italic>sid ha&#x2019;heichal</italic> (the white lime used in the Sanctuary), and <italic>krum beitza</italic> (the membrane of an egg). Of these four shades the whitest is <italic>bahereth</italic>, the next is <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic>, the next <italic>sid</italic>, and the dullest is <italic>krum beitza</italic> (Rambam Mishneh Torah, <italic>Hilchoth Tum&#x2019;ath Tzara&#x2019;ath</italic> 1:2). See further Note 107.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn992">(106) Further, Verse 43.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn993">(107) <italic>Sid ha&#x2019;heichal</italic> is the secondary shade of <italic>bahereth</italic>, and <italic>krum beitza</italic> is the subsidiary species of <italic>se&#x2019;eith</italic>. A priest who does not distinguish between these four shades of white, and does not know them by name and how they are related to each other, has no authority to inspect the plague (Rambam, above, Note 105). He may, however, bring with him a learned person &#x2014; even if he be an Israelite &#x2014; who upon examining it will direct him to say &#x201C;pure&#x201D; or &#x201C;impure&#x201D; etc. (Rambam, <italic>ibid.</italic>, 9:2).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn994">(108) Verses 30, 36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn995">(109) Verse 30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn996">(110) Above, Verse 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn997">(111) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn998">(112) Further, Verse 40.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn999">(113) I Samuel 25:25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1000">(114) Negaim 7:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1001">(115) Now the head or the beard become impure only by a <italic>nethek</italic> (scall), and not by a <italic>bahereth;</italic> (a bright white spot). Thus when the <italic>bahereth</italic> first appeared on the head or the beard, the person remained pure. Later on when he became bald, in which case the law of <italic>bahereth</italic> might have applied, he also remains pure, because the <italic>bahereth</italic> preceded the baldness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1002">(116) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 10:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1003">(117) The law of hair which has become gold-colored because of the <italic>nethek</italic> provides that if there be two black hairs in it, the person is pure [although all the other hair have turned gold-colored]. But if there be in it two gold-colored hairs that were there before the <italic>nethek</italic> came, and turned the other black hair gold-colored, they do not afford protection to the <italic>nethek</italic>, and the person is impure. Thus Rabbi Eliezer&#x2019;s statement: &#x201C;It neither renders the person impure [if all the hair turned gold-colored before the <italic>nethek</italic> appeared], nor does it afford protection&#x201D; [thus we do not say that since it was naturally gold-colored before the <italic>nethek</italic> appeared, and not as a result of it, it is considered like black hair which renders the person pure, because although it is not in itself a symptom of the plague, it is nonetheless unable to protect the person from impurity unless its natural colors is black].</ftnote>

<title>Metzora</title>
<h1>14</h1>
<p>2. THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER IN THE DAY OF HIS CLEANSING: HE SHALL BE BROUGHT UNTO THE PRIEST. Scripture is stating that this shall be the law of the leper in the day that he wishes to be pronounced pure, that he should be brought to the priest, as he can never attain purity except by means of the priest&#x2019;s word. Then [in the following verse] Scripture tells that <italic>the priest shall go forth to</italic> the place of his [the leper&#x2019;s] habitation <italic>out of the camp</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1044">1</xref></sup> but he [the leper] is not to come to the priest even though his leprosy has been healed.<sup><xref rid="fn1045">2</xref></sup> The interpretation thereof in the Torath Kohanim is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn1046">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And he shall be brought unto the priest</italic>, this means that he is not to wait.&#x201D; If so, Scripture is stating that on the same day that he is cleansed, [meaning] that he is cured from his leprosy,<sup><xref rid="fn1047">4</xref></sup> he is to be brought even against his will to the priest. Similarly, the verses, <italic>And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1048">5</xref></sup> <italic>But if she be cleansed of her issue</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1049">6</xref></sup> mean when [the issues] will cease and the persons become cleansed of them, as I have explained [i.e., that the term &#x201C;cleansing&#x201D; in the verse before us means &#x201C;the healing&#x201D; of the leprosy, and the same meaning applies to &#x201C;the cleansing,&#x201D; of him or her that hath an issue]. This is the correct explanation.</p>
<p>4. THEN SHALL THE PRIEST COMMAND TO TAKE FOR HIM THAT IS TO BE CLEANSED TWO LIVING, CLEAN &#x2018;TZIPORIM&#x2019; (BIRDS). &#x201C;<italic>Living</italic>, this excludes birds which are <italic>treifah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1050">7</xref></sup> <italic>Clean</italic>, this excludes a bird unfit for food. Since the plagues of leprosy came as a punishment for slander, which is done by chattering, therefore Scripture required for the leper&#x2019;s cleansing that he bring birds which always twitter with a chirping sound.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>Now in view of the fact that Rashi wrote, &#x201C;<italic>Clean</italic>, this excludes a bird which is unfit for food,&#x201D; we can deduce that the [unqualified] term <italic>tziporim</italic> does not denote a permissible species of birds, but is instead a generic term for all birds [those permissible as food and those forbidden]. If so, the question appears: what is this &#x201C;chirping&#x201D; that they found [among the <italic>tziporim</italic>]? For there are many birds among which <italic>there is none that openeth the mouth, or chirpeth</italic>&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1051">8</xref></sup> Moreover, the interpretation [which Rashi quoted]: &#x201C;<italic>Living</italic>, this excludes birds which are <italic>treifah</italic>,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1050">7</xref></sup> is really subject to a controversy of opinion,<sup><xref rid="fn1052">9</xref></sup> and according to the Sage who says that a <italic>treifah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1050">7</xref></sup> can survive, this interpretation [of Rashi] is not correct. And in the Torath Kohanim we find this interpretation:<sup><xref rid="fn1053">10</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Living</italic>, not slaughtered. <italic>Clean</italic>, not unfit for food. <italic>Clean</italic>, not <italic>treifoth</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1054">11</xref></sup> Now the scholars who follow the simple meaning of Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn1055">12</xref></sup> say that every kind of bird [whether permissible as food or forbidden] is called <italic>tzipor</italic>, as is evidenced by the verses which state: <italic>&#x2018;tzipor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the fowl</italic>) <italic>of the air, and the fish of the sea;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1056">13</xref></sup> <italic>every &#x2018;tzipor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>bird</italic>) <italic>of every sort;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1057">14</xref></sup> <italic>And thou son of man &#x2026; speak &#x2018;l&#x2019;tzipor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>unto the birds</italic>) <italic>of every sort</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1058">15</xref></sup> Similarly, it says, <italic>and &#x2018;hatzipor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the birds</italic>) <italic>he did not divide</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1059">16</xref></sup> with reference to the turtle-doves and young pigeons<sup><xref rid="fn1060">17</xref></sup> [which are permissible birds, thus proving that the term <italic>tzipor</italic> is used with reference to both permissible and forbidden birds].</p>
<p>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the term <italic>tzipor</italic> is a generic term for all small birds that rise early in the morning to chirp and to sing, the term being associated with the Aramaic word <italic>tzaphra</italic> (morning). Similarly, the expression <italic>let him return v&#x2019;yitzpor&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1061">18</xref></sup> means, and arise &#x201C;early in the morning.&#x201D; The expression <italic>&#x2018;tzipor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the fowl of</italic>) <italic>the air</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1056">13</xref></sup> is said with reference to these small birds, because it is mostly they that fly high in the air. <italic>Every &#x2018;tzipor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>bird</italic>) <italic>of every sort</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1057">14</xref></sup> refers to two kinds, all the little ones and the big ones. <italic>If a &#x2018;kan tzipor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>bird&#x2019;s nest</italic>) <italic>chance to be before thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1062">19</xref></sup> speaks about the little ones which are many [and therefore likely to chance to be there], to teach that even when they are young, the finder must exercise mercy towards them. Similarly, <italic>therein &#x2018;tziporim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the birds</italic>) <italic>make nests</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1063">20</xref></sup> [means the little ones], for it is they that dwell on the boughs of the cedars of the Lebanon. <italic>Speak &#x2018;l&#x2019;tzipor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>unto the birds</italic>) <italic>of every sort</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1058">15</xref></sup> means that even the little ones should gather upon [the flesh of the mighty that have fallen in battle],<sup><xref rid="fn1064">21</xref></sup> for the big marauding birds will come by themselves. Similarly, <italic>Wilt thou play with him</italic> [the leviathan] <italic>&#x2018;katzipor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>as with a bird</italic>)? <italic>Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1065">22</xref></sup> [refers to the little birds], for it is the way of young boys to play with little birds. The language of the Sages also follows that usage: Any statue which bears in its hand a staff or <italic>&#x2018;tzipor&#x2019;</italic> (a bird)<sup><xref rid="fn1066">23</xref></sup> [one may not derive any benefit from, since these objects indicate that the statue is worshipped as an idol]; &#x201C;If a man wove into a garment one <italic>sit&#x2019;s</italic> length of a Nazirite&#x2019;s hair [from which one is forbidden to derive any benefit], the garment is to be burnt,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1067">24</xref></sup> [and when the Sages of the Gemara raised the question, &#x201C;why is this small piece not neutralized by the larger part of the garment?&#x201D; it was answered that this is a case where he wove into the garment &#x201C;the form of] a <italic>tziporta</italic>&#x201D; [a small bird, which made the whole garment more valuable, and therefore it is not neutralized by the larger part thereof, and hence must be burnt].<sup><xref rid="fn1068">25</xref></sup> The Sages also speak of &#x201C;<italic>tziporoth</italic> (birds of) the vineyard [however small].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1069">26</xref></sup> They also said: &#x201C;the meat of <italic>tziporim</italic> (birds) brings back a sickness to a sick man [who is recovering, and makes it worse&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1070">27</xref></sup> thus indicating that the term <italic>tzipor</italic> refers to a bird which one may eat]. Scripture further states, <italic>All &#x2018;tzipor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>birds</italic>) <italic>that are clean ye may eat</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1071">28</xref></sup> meaning all these many species of [permissible] birds, thus including [the living bird sent away by] the leper [into the open field<sup><xref rid="fn1072">29</xref></sup> as permissible food],<sup><xref rid="fn1073">30</xref></sup> by means of the word <italic>kol</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;All&#x2019; birds that are clean ye may eat</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1071">28</xref></sup> And the verse which states, <italic>But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the great vulture, and the bearded vulture, and the osprey</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1074">31</xref></sup> is [to be understood] as if it said, &#x201C;and these are they, from the flesh of which ye may not eat.&#x201D; It is for this reason [i.e., since the term <italic>tzipor</italic> includes both permissible and forbidden birds], that the Sages found it necessary to interpret:<sup><xref rid="fn1053">10</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Clean</italic>, not forbidden birds&#x201D; [but they would not have been able to derive it if the word <italic>tziporim</italic> had not been qualified]. In any case it is clear that <italic>tziporim</italic> are the small chirping birds. Similarly, <italic>Yea, the &#x2018;tzipor&#x2019; hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1075">32</xref></sup> also indicates that the word <italic>tzipor</italic> is not a name for all birds [for otherwise why should the verse mention both <italic>tzipor</italic> and the swallow, if the term <italic>tzipor</italic> already includes all birds]. Likewise, <italic>Wherein tziporim</italic> (<italic>the birds</italic>) <italic>make their nests, the stork makes the fir-tree her house</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1076">33</xref></sup> [indicates that <italic>tziporim</italic> does not include all birds, since the verse proceeds also to mention some specific birds].</p>
<p>It would appear from the words of our Sages that all birds permissible as food are called <italic>tzipor</italic>, but the leper was commanded to bring <italic>tziporei dror</italic> [&#x201C;free birds,&#x201D; a term which, as explained further on means birds which live in the house as well as in the field], for we have been taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn1077">34</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open field</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1078">35</xref></sup> Rabbi Yosei the Galilean said: &#x2018;This means a bird that lives outside all cities. And what kind of bird is it? It is the bird called <italic>dror</italic>&#x2019; &#x201D; [the free bird that lives in the house as well as in the field]. It is on the basis of this interpretation of the Rabbis that they further mentioned [in connection with the leper&#x2019;s birds] that they &#x201C;chatter&#x201D; [since it is usually these free birds which twitter].</p>
<p>It is possible that the requirement that the birds be of &#x201C;the free&#x201D; kind is a commandment [which is to be observed if possible, but is not indispensable], so that if it has already been done, they are all valid [whether free or unfree]. Therefore the Sages in the Torath Kohanim<sup><xref rid="fn1053">10</xref></sup> found it necessary to exclude forbidden bird&#x2019;s [which do not possess this characteristic of living in the house and in the field]. And so we have been taught in a Mishnah of Tractate Negaim:<sup><xref rid="fn1079">36</xref></sup> &#x201C;And he [the leper] brought two birds that are of the free type of bird.&#x201D; And it is furthermore taught there:<sup><xref rid="fn1080">37</xref></sup> &#x201C;It is a commandment that the two birds of the leper should be alike in appearance, in size and in value, and that they should be brought at the same time. Yet even if they are not alike, they are valid. If one was slaughtered and it was found that it was not a &#x2018;free bird,&#x2019; he should buy a partner for the second one.&#x201D; The reason [why he must buy a partner for the second one] although [as we have said above] if it has already been done, all birds [whether free or unfree] are valid, is that if they were of two different kinds [as in this case, where the slaughtered one was a non-<italic>dror</italic>, and the living one a <italic>dror</italic>], they <italic>are</italic> invalid. And in the Chapter <italic>Eilu Treifoth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1081">38</xref></sup> the Sages of the Gemara have said: &#x201C;A bird which scratches, is valid to be used for the purification of the leper. This is the white-bellied swallow concerning which Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages differed&#x201D; [as explained further on]. From these texts [it is clear] that the birds for the purification of the leper are not limited to one species, and that the purification is not to be done with <italic>any</italic> permissible bird, but rather the commandment is that it be done only with those birds that are <italic>dror</italic>, that is to say, &#x201C;which live in the house as well as in the field.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1082">39</xref></sup> Therefore the Rabbis said [in the above-quoted text] with reference to the white-bellied swallow, that since according to the Sages it is a bird which may be eaten, it is also valid for the purification of the leper, as it is included within [the category of those birds that are] <italic>dror</italic> [living in the house as well as in the field]. Yet nonetheless <italic>all</italic> permissible birds [even those that are not &#x201C;free birds&#x201D;] are valid, if the purification of the leper has already been done with them, since they are all included within the phrase, <italic>two living clean birds</italic>.</p>
<p>And we have been taught in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn1083">40</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Yashiyah said: &#x2018;Wherever it says in Scripture <italic>tzipor</italic>, it speaks of a permissible bird.&#x2019; Said Rabbi Yitzchak: &#x2018;A permissible bird is called <italic>oph</italic> (fowl) and also <italic>tzipor</italic> (bird), but a forbidden one is only called <italic>oph</italic>.&#x201D; Similarly the Rabbis mentioned also in the Gemara [of Tractate Chullin], in the Chapter <italic>Shilu&#x2019;ach Hakan</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1084">41</xref></sup> where they resolved that the term <italic>living</italic> [<italic>two &#x2018;living&#x2019; clean birds</italic>] means &#x201C;the ends of whose limbs &#x2018;live&#x2019; (exist), thus excluding birds from whom a limb is missing.&#x201D; Similarly [permissible] birds which are <italic>treifah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1050">7</xref></sup> are invalid [for the purification of the leper]. The Rabbis also interpreted there<sup><xref rid="fn1084">41</xref></sup> the term <italic>clean</italic> [<italic>two living &#x2018;clean&#x2019; birds</italic>] to exclude those birds which are of a permissible species but are forbidden to be eaten [for some special reason], such as birds belonging to a person of a city that went astray,<sup><xref rid="fn1085">42</xref></sup> or a fowl that killed a human being, or those that have been exchanged for an idol.<sup><xref rid="fn1086">43</xref></sup> This interpretation was derived by the Sages from the very language itself, since the term <italic>tzipor</italic> denotes only a permissible bird. It is clear then from this text, that all permissible birds [whether they are of the dror-type or not] are included within the category of <italic>tzipor</italic>.</p>
<p>I have further seen in the Yerushalmi of Tractate Nazir<sup><xref rid="fn1087">44</xref></sup> that the Sages of the Gemara said: &#x201C;But does an impure Nazirite really bring <italic>tziporim</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn1088">45</xref></sup> It is turtle-doves or young pigeons that he brings&#x0021; [To this question the reply was made:] &#x2018;There are some authorities who teach that all edible birds are called <italic>tziporim</italic>, and there are other authorities that teach that all birds, whether permissible or forbidden, are called <italic>tziporim</italic>.&#x2019; &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1089">46</xref></sup> Thus we are now left with a divergence of opinion [as to what the term <italic>tzipor</italic> denotes]&#x0021; Yet it is possible that the name applies only to the small birds. This appears so in the Gemara from what the Rabbis have said in Tractate Sotah:<sup><xref rid="fn1090">47</xref></sup> [In the process of his purification the leper is commanded to] &#x201C;bring a sufficient amount of water that the bird&#x2019;s blood may remain discernible in it.<sup><xref rid="fn1091">48</xref></sup> And how much is this? The fourth of a <italic>log</italic>.&#x201D; Upon this the Sages queried: &#x201C;If the bird was a large one so that the blood thereof &#x2018;pushed away&#x2019; the water [so that it was imperceptible], or the bird was a small one so that its blood was &#x2018;pushed away&#x2019; by the water [so that the blood was indiscernible], what is the ruling on these cases?&#x201D; On these questions [the Rabbis of the Talmud] explained: &#x201C;All standard measures laid down by the Sages were fixed with precision. The Sages estimated with reference to a &#x2018;free bird&#x2019; that you will not find one so big that the blood thereof will &#x2018;push away&#x2019; the water, nor will you find one so small that the blood thereof will be &#x2018;pushed away&#x2019; by the water.&#x201D; Now if all kinds of permissible birds were valid for [the purification of the leper], there are some birds the blood of which would &#x201C;push away&#x201D; many <italic>logim</italic> of water&#x0021; Perhaps the Sages established the above standard only with reference to a &#x201C;free bird&#x201D; which one is commanded to bring if this is possible, according to the interpretation of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean,<sup><xref rid="fn1092">49</xref></sup> [but if the purification has already been done with a large bird, it is also valid]. It has already been mentioned in the Gemara:<sup><xref rid="fn1093">50</xref></sup> &#x201C;Perhaps he saw a large <italic>tziporo</italic> (bird) and he called it <italic>gamal</italic> (camel).&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1094">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>The correct [and final] conclusion which emerges from all this discussion is that we say on the basis of this interpretation<sup><xref rid="fn1092">49</xref></sup> that any bird which is not a &#x201C;free one&#x201D; is invalid for the purification of the leper, even if the purification has already been done, since in the Mishnah thereof<sup><xref rid="fn1080">37</xref></sup> it was not taught: &#x201C;It is a commandment [to be fulfilled if possible] that the birds should be &#x2018;free birds,&#x2019; but even if they were not &#x2018;free birds,&#x2019; they are valid,&#x201D; as it taught concerning the requirement of equality [in appearance, size and value, that &#x201C;even if they are not alike, they are valid&#x201D;]; also, the correct conclusion is that all birds that are &#x201C;free birds&#x201D; are those that chatter. And that which the Rabbis said in the Torath Kohanim,<sup><xref rid="fn1053">10</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Clean</italic>, not those forbidden as food,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1095">52</xref></sup> is because even among the forbidden birds there are some species that possess this quality of <italic>dror</italic> [living in the house as well as in the field], such as the white-bellied swallow according to Rabbi Eliezer.<sup><xref rid="fn1096">53</xref></sup> Or perhaps the meaning of the Torath Kohanim is that it excludes those birds [whose prohibition is not because they belong to the forbidden species, but because of special circumstances] which make them &#x201C;forbidden to you,&#x201D; such as those birds which are nonetheless forbidden [as food or benefit, because they belonged to a person of a city that had gone astray,<sup><xref rid="fn1085">42</xref></sup> or those that have been exchanged for an idol],<sup><xref rid="fn1086">43</xref></sup> or those which are <italic>treifah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1050">7</xref></sup> just as the Rabbis resolved in the Gemara in the Chapter <italic>Shilu&#x2019;ach Hakan</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1084">41</xref></sup> This is the correct interpretation in my eyes. In the Agadah of the [Midrash] Rabbah we find this statement:<sup><xref rid="fn1097">54</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Simon said: These birds [brought by the leper for his purification] are noisy ones, symbolic of he who speaks slander [and as a punishment for which, the slanderer is stricken with leprosy]. Said the Holy One, blessed be He, &#x2018;Let that which is accompanied by sound [namely, these noisy birds] come to bring atonement for the evil sound [of the slanderer].&#x2019; And Rabbi Yehoshua the son of Levi said: The birds [brought by the leper for his purification] are of the &#x2018;free kind&#x2019; [that live in the house as well as in the field] and thus ate of the leper&#x2019;s bread and drank of his water. Now the following statement follows logically with stronger reason etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1098">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND CEDAR-WOOD, AND SCARLET, AND HYSSOP. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that &#x201C;[the cedar-wood and the hyssop] represent the tallest and the lowest in species of vegetation, as is evidenced by the words of wisdom of Solomon.<sup><xref rid="fn1099">56</xref></sup> Thus the law of the leper and the law of the house stricken with leprosy and the [law of] impurity [conveyed by] a corpse are closely related,<sup><xref rid="fn1100">57</xref></sup> and they resemble the Passover in Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn1101">58</xref></sup> And the meaning of the expression <italic>into the open field</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1102">59</xref></sup> is to an uninhabitated place, so that no infection might be caused.&#x201D; [Thus far are the words of Ibn Ezra.].</p>
<p>And in the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1103">60</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Into the open field</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1102">59</xref></sup> this means that he is not to stand in Joppa [which is on the sea] and let it go into the sea, nor is he to stand in Gabbath [a city which is on the edge of the desert] and let it go into the desert.&#x201D; Now if so, [that he may not let it go into the sea or into the desert], then the reason why it is sent into the open field is like the secret of the goat sent to Azazel,<sup><xref rid="fn1104">61</xref></sup> except that there it is sent <italic>for Azazel into the wilderness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1104">61</xref></sup> and here it is sent to the flying [destructive spirits] of the field.<sup><xref rid="fn1105">62</xref></sup> I will yet explain this with the help of G-d.<sup><xref rid="fn1106">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND IT SHALL BE ON THE SEVENTH DAY, THAT HE SHALL SHAVE ALL HIS HAIR, HIS HEAD AND HIS BEARD AND HIS EYEBROWS, EVEN ALL HIS HAIR HE SHALL SHAVE OFF. &#x201C;This is a general principle [<italic>he shall shave all his head</italic>] followed by an enumeration of particulars [already comprehended in the general proposition, i.e., <italic>his head</italic> etc.] and [this again is followed by] a generalization [<italic>all his hair he shall shave off</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1107">64</xref></sup> This is to include every spot of the body where there is a visible collection of hair&#x201D; [just like the head, beard and eyebrows]. This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>But in the Torath Kohanim it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn1108">65</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And he shall shave off all his hair</italic>. I might think this includes the hidden parts of the body; Scripture therefore states, <italic>his eyebrows</italic>. Just as the eyebrows are visible, so also [the expression] <italic>all his hair</italic> refers only to visible parts of the body, thus excluding hair which is in the hidden parts of the body. If so I might think, just as the eyebrows are in a place where there is a visible collection of hair, so we are to include [only] those places where there is a visible collection of hair. Whence do I know to include [in the commandment of shaving his hair] an invisible collection of hair [such as under the armpits, and between the legs], or a visible scattering of hair [such as on the stomach or ribs] or an invisible scattering of hair [such as the hair in the folds of the body]? Scripture therefore says, <italic>even all his hair he shall shave off</italic>.&#x201D; However, the Rabbi [Rashi] followed the interpretation of Rabbi Yishmael,<sup><xref rid="fn1107">64</xref></sup> who included only the hair between the legs, and excluded the hair under the armpits and on the whole body [since they are not &#x201C;visible collections of hair].&#x201D; But here the accepted law is that he shaves his body as smooth as a gourd, either because this is one [of the three instances] where the practice goes beyond the Biblical text,<sup><xref rid="fn1109">66</xref></sup> or because the accepted law is like the opinion of Rabbi Akiba, who [as a consequence of his wider method of exegesis] included the hair of the whole body [in the requirement of being shaved], and excluded only the hair within the nose [or ears]. So also have we been taught in a Mishnah [like Rabbi Akiba]:<sup><xref rid="fn1110">67</xref></sup> &#x201C;He passed the razor over the whole of his body,&#x201D; and it is further explained in the second chapter of Tractate Sotah.<sup><xref rid="fn1109">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY HE SHALL TAKE TWO HE-LAMBS WITHOUT BLEMISH, AND ONE EWE-LAMB. Scripture has not explained what is to be done with the two he-lambs and the one ewe-lamb. However, it mentioned concerning one of the he-lambs that the priest offer it as a guilt-offering,<sup><xref rid="fn1111">68</xref></sup> and further mentioned that he should offer up the sin-offering,<sup><xref rid="fn1112">69</xref></sup> <italic>and afterward he shall slaughter the burnt-offering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1112">69</xref></sup> This is because He has already mentioned in the section of <italic>Vayikra</italic> that the sin-offering should be a female,<sup><xref rid="fn1113">70</xref></sup> and that every burnt-offering should be a male.<sup><xref rid="fn1114">71</xref></sup> Therefore there was no need here to speak at length, it being known that [since the first he-lamb was a guilt-offering], the second he-lamb would be the burnt-offering, and the ewe-lamb would be the sin-offering.</p>
<p>18. AND THE REST OF THE OIL THAT IS IN THE PRIEST&#x2019;S HAND HE SHALL PUT UPON THE HEAD OF HIM TO BE CLEANSED; AND THE PRIEST SHALL MAKE ATONEMENT FOR HIM BEFORE THE ETERNAL. This atonement is accomplished by means of the priest&#x2019;s acts with the blood of the guilt-offering [as prescribed in Verse 14] and the oil [as set forth in Verses 15-18]. Similarly, the verse stating [in connection with a leper who is poor], <italic>to make atonement for him before the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1115">72</xref></sup> [carries the same meaning]. And in the Torath Kohanim we find it said:<sup><xref rid="fn1116">73</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And the rest of the oil that is in the priest&#x2019;s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, and the priest shall make atonement</italic>. &#x2018;If he put [the rest of the oil upon his head], he effected atonement for him, and if he did not put it thereon, he did not effect atonement.&#x2019; These are the words of Rabbi Akiba. Rabbi Yochanan the son of Nuri said: &#x2018;This is the <italic>residue</italic> of a commandment, [and therefore is not part of the commandment itself, and thus not indispensable]; whether he put it thereon or did not put it thereon, he has effected atonement.&#x2019; &#x201D; Now if so, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan the son of Nuri, the expression <italic>and the priest shall make atonement for him</italic>, refers [only] to the guilt-offering [which <italic>is</italic> indispensable in the final purification of the leper].</p>
<p>Now Scripture states [here] in the case of the guilt-offering, <italic>and the priest shall make atonement</italic>, and then states again in the case of the sin-offering, <italic>and he shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1117">74</xref></sup> and with reference to the burnt-offering and meal-offering it also states, <italic>and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1118">75</xref></sup> But we do not know the purport of all these expressions of atonement. Perhaps the guilt-offering effects atonement for the trespass that he committed before he was affected by his plague, and the sin-offering effects atonement for his sin which he committed during the time of the plague. For perhaps in his anguish <italic>he ascribed aught unseemly to G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1119">76</xref></sup> this being the significance of the expression <italic>because of his uncleanness</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1117">74</xref></sup> [used in connection with the sin-offering that he must bring]. The burnt-offering and meal-offering constitute a ransom for his soul, that he be worthy to be purified and return to his dwelling. Therefore He said, <italic>and the priest shall make atonement for him, &#x2018;and he shall be clean</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1118">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now in the Torath Kohanim it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn1120">77</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1117">74</xref></sup> Why is this said?<sup><xref rid="fn1121">78</xref></sup> Since it is said, <italic>And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1118">75</xref></sup> I might think that they are all indispensible for the purification of the leper, therefore Scripture states, <italic>and the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1117">74</xref></sup> thus teaching that the atonement is dependent [only] upon the sin-offering.&#x201D; It is possible that the expression <italic>and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1118">75</xref></sup> alludes to everything that has been done for him [i.e., for the leper&#x2019;s purification],for the birds [which he brought at the very beginning of his purification, followed by the three offerings brought on the eighth day, as discussed here] also came for the purpose of atonement and purification, for so He also said in connection with a plague in the house, <italic>and he shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1122">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. Scripture states with reference to plagues in houses, <italic>and &#x2018;I&#x2019; shall put the plague of leprosy</italic>, in order to allude to the fact that it was G-d&#x2019;s hand that did this, and not an act of nature at all, as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1123">80</xref></sup> It states, <italic>When ye are come into the land of Canaan</italic> etc. <italic>in a house of the Land of your possession</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1124">81</xref></sup> because He is speaking to all Israel [since Moses and Aaron did not come into the Land]. Now it would have been proper that after the verse, <italic>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1125">82</xref></sup> He should continue to state, &#x201C;Speak ye unto the children of Israel.&#x201D; But Scripture shortens the account since it is self-understood [that the command was to be given to the children of Israel who would enter the Land]. Or it may be that he spoke to them in the place of [i.e., as representing] all Israel, and hinted that the intention [of giving the commandment] now is merely to teach them all the laws of leprosy, and that they in turn should teach them to the priests, and Moses did not warn all Israel now [about these laws, as they did not apply until they came into the Land]. It was only those who came into the Land that he warned, <italic>Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn1126">83</xref></sup> for it was to them that he commanded at first to take heed in these ordinances.</p>
<p>43. AND IF THE PLAGUE RETURN AND BREAK OUT IN THE HOUSE. Now this plague which came in the other stones and in the other mortar [which replaced the original ones], is not identical with the first plague which was there, [but is a different outbreak]. It is thus unlike the &#x201C;breaking out&#x201D; of the leprosy mentioned in the case of a person<sup><xref rid="fn1127">84</xref></sup> and the spreading thereof, which mean that the plague returned to its former natural place, since the pus many times hides under the skin and retreats into the interior of the body, and afterwards it returns and spreads to the skin on its outside. Rather, the matter [of leprosy in a house] is as I have written in <italic>Seder Ishah Ki Thazria</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1123">80</xref></sup> that it is a plague and Divine intervention implying that <italic>the evil spirit from G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1128">85</xref></sup> is in that place. And in the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1129">86</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And if the plague come again, and break out in the house</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1130">87</xref></sup> This is like saying, &#x2018;That person has returned to his place.&#x2019; &#x201D; The meaning of the Sages is to state that the expression <italic>&#x2018;u&#x2019;parach&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and it break out</italic>) mentioned here [in connection with leprosy in a house], does not mean &#x201C;spreading out&#x201D; as it does in the verse [dealing with leprosy of a man], <italic>And if the leprosy &#x2018;paro&#x2019;ach tiphrach&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>break out abroad</italic>) <italic>in the skin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1131">88</xref></sup> but here it denotes a [fresh] outbreak in that place just like the expression, <italic>the rod of Aaron &#x2018;parach&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>was budded</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1132">89</xref></sup> The comparison that the Rabbis drew [i.e., that this is like saying, &#x201C;That person has returned to his place&#x201D;], is to allude to the matter we have stated, namely, that this is not a plague which comes into existence and spreads out [as in the case of leprosy of man], but is one outbreak after another, just like a man who left his place and then came back to sit in his former place, on a different chair which was prepared for him there. I have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn1123">80</xref></sup> the meaning of this &#x201C;breaking out&#x201D; [of leprosy in a house], as well as of the &#x201C;breaking out&#x201D; of leprosy in garments.<sup><xref rid="fn1133">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Scripture does not state here, &#x201C;and if the plague comes back, and breaks out &#x2018;in those stones&#x2019; &#x201D; [but instead it says, <italic>and breaks out &#x2018;in the house&#x2019;</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1130">87</xref></sup> for even if it broke out in another place of the house, and even if it was of another color, unlike that of the first plague, it is considered a recurring plague [i.e., one that recurs after removal of the stones, scraping and replastering, which necessitates the demolition of the house], and is not considered a plague appearing for the first time in the house. This is the sense of the expression <italic>in the house</italic> [<italic>and if the plague come again, and break out &#x2018;in the house&#x2019;</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1130">87</xref></sup> meaning that wherever it recurs in the house, it is governed by that law [which requires the demolition of the house]. The reason for this is that the evil spirit will not depart from that house, but will always be in one of the places in that house, to frighten its owners. So also the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn1134">91</xref></sup> I know only that [the house is to be demolished] if the plague returns to its former place. Whence do I know to include a return to any place in the house? Scripture therefore says, <italic>in the house</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1130">87</xref></sup> I know only that this rule applies if the plague recurs in its original color. Whence do I know that even if it recurs in a different color [it is governed by the same rule]? Scripture therefore says, <italic>and it break out</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1130">87</xref></sup> [meaning, in its original color or a different one].</p>
<p>Now the meaning of these verses according to the interpretation [of the Torath Kohanim] is as follows. <italic>And if the plague come again</italic> on the seventh day and returns <italic>in the house, after that the stones have been taken out, and after the house hath been scraped, and after it is plastered</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1130">87</xref></sup> or<sup><xref rid="fn1135">92</xref></sup> <italic>the priest shall come</italic> a second time <italic>and see, and, behold</italic>, that now <italic>the plague has recurred</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1136">93</xref></sup> <italic>in the house</italic> as it was at first, <italic>it is malignant leprosy &#x2026; and he shall break down the house</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1137">94</xref></sup> the two verses thus explaining that whether the plague recurred at the end of the first week or at the end of the second week, they are governed by one law [which requires the demolition of the house].<sup><xref rid="fn1138">95</xref></sup> Scripture did not need to say [in Verse 44] &#x201C;<italic>and the priest shall come and see, if the plague be &#x2018;pasah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>have recurred</italic>) <italic>in the house</italic> &#x2014; he shall then command that they take out the stones&#x201D; etc., [as Rashi would have it],<sup><xref rid="fn1139">96</xref></sup> for this verse [<italic>and the priest shall come &#x2026;</italic>] is connected with the verse [43] immediately preceding it, stating, <italic>if the plague come again &#x2026; after that the stones have been taken out</italic> at the end of the first week or the second week, when the priest comes, and he sees its recurrence, <italic>it is a malignant leprosy</italic>. Then Scripture further states, <italic>And if the priest shall come in</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1140">97</xref></sup> that is, at the end of the second week mentioned above [in Verse 44], <italic>and see it, and, behold, the plague hath not recurred</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1141">98</xref></sup> <italic>in the house, after that the house was plastered; then the priest shall pronounce the house clean</italic>, since it is healed of the plague, that is to say, it did not recur. Thus we now derive the principle that if a plague remained as it was during the first week and the second week, he removes the stones, scrapes away and replasters, and gives it another week, and if the plague returns, he demolishes the house. This is the correct interpretation of the verses in accordance with the [Rabbinical] interpretation thereof, for it is impossible to cut them, so to say, with a knife<sup><xref rid="fn1142">99</xref></sup> placing later verses first and earlier verses later, in a manner which is not all their meaning.</p>
<p>It is further possible that we say as a correct interpretation of the verses on this subject, that the term <italic>pasah</italic> in this section [which deals with leprosy in a house], is like <italic>parach</italic>, both of them being an expression of &#x201C;sprouting.&#x201D; Where a plague exists already, the term <italic>pasah</italic> denotes its growth and extension, and where there is no plague, it means its [original] sprouting and [subsequent] recurrence, since it is all a matter of growth. Onkelos also has rendered all [expressions of <italic>pasah</italic>] as <italic>oseiph</italic> (adding), and the term <italic>tosepheth</italic> (addition) is used of a growing thing which is added to another, such as in the expressions: <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;nosaph gam hu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>they be added also</italic>) <italic>to our enemies;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1143">100</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;nosphah nachalathan&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>then will their inheritance be added</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1144">101</xref></sup> and it may also be used of a matter which &#x201C;returns,&#x201D; such as: <italic>the Eternal &#x2018;yosiph&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>will set again</italic>) <italic>His hand;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1145">102</xref></sup> <italic>and they prophesied &#x2018;v&#x2019;lo yasaphu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>but they did so no more</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1146">103</xref></sup> meaning that [Eldad and Meidad] did not prophesy any more. Thus the meaning of the term <italic>pasah</italic> is that the plague &#x201C;returned.&#x201D; Now after the removing of the stones, [scraping and replastering], when Scripture speaks of <italic>pisayon</italic> [as it does in Verse 44 and 48], the meaning thereof is &#x201C;sprouting,&#x201D; as I have mentioned in connection with the term <italic>prichah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1147">104</xref></sup> If so, Scripture is stating: <italic>and if the plague came again and &#x2018;sprouted&#x2019; in the house, after that the stones have been taken out &#x2026; and the priest shall come and see, and, behold the plague has &#x2018;sprouted&#x2019; in the house &#x2026; then he shall break down the house</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1148">105</xref></sup> for every plague that returns is a sign of confirmed impurity. <italic>And if the priest shall come in, and see that the plague has not &#x2018;sprouted&#x2019;</italic> at all <italic>in the house, after the house was plastered</italic>, he shall pronounce it pure, <italic>because the plague has been healed</italic> by the removal of the stones, [scraping] and replastering.</p>
<p>Thus the law of a house wherein the plague recurs at the end of the first week has been explained here, that he removes the stones, scrapes and replasters, and gives it another week. If the plague returns the house is impure [and is to be demolished], and if it does not return it is pure. But where it remained at the end of the first week as it was [when he first saw it], and it recurred at the end of the second week, the law thereof was not explained in the Torah, but we derive it by means of a <italic>gzeirah shavah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1149">106</xref></sup> as follows: [the expression, <italic>and behold if the plague recur</italic> is found both in Verse 44: <italic>and the priest shall come</italic>, and in Verse 39: <italic>and the priest shall return</italic>, thus establishing that] &#x201C;<italic>coming</italic> [in Verse 44] and <italic>returning</italic> [in Verse 39] are identical in regard to their law,&#x201D; meaning that the law of &#x201C;coming&#x201D; which is stated at the end of the second week, is like the law of &#x201C;returning&#x201D; stated at the end of the first week, i.e., that in both cases if the plague recurred, he removes the stones, scrapes and replasters and gives it another week.<sup><xref rid="fn1150">107</xref></sup> Similarly, if the plague remained as it was [at the end of] the first and second weeks, and recurred [at the end of] the third week, the law thereof is not mentioned in the Torah, but it is derived by means of another <italic>gzeirah shavah:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1149">106</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;im bo yavo hakohein&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and if the priest shall come in</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1151">108</xref></sup> thus establishing that the priest&#x2019;s third coming is identical in law to his coming the second time.<sup><xref rid="fn1152">109</xref></sup> Thus the verses are explained in line with their simple meaning, while the [Rabbinical] interpretations were derived by a <italic>gzeirah shavah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1149">106</xref></sup> taught to Moses on Sinai. And that which the Rabbis said in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn1153">110</xref></sup> &#x201C;What does Scripture refer to? etc.&#x201D; [from which you might think that these interpretations were originally established by the Rabbis, and not based on the <italic>gzeirah shavah</italic> taught to Moses on Sinai], is merely a Rabbinical support, since they wanted to find a basis in the Scriptural text for that principle which they had received by tradition established by the <italic>gzeirah shavah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1149">106</xref></sup> Similarly, what the Rabbis said there:<sup><xref rid="fn1154">111</xref></sup> &#x201C;If we are eventually to include a plague which recurred, even though it did not extend [in the law requiring the removal of the stones etc.], why then does Scripture say, <italic>And the priest shall come and see, and behold, if the plague be &#x2018;pasah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>extended</italic>)?<sup><xref rid="fn1155">112</xref></sup> Leave it.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1156">113</xref></sup> That is to say, we are to leave here the plain meaning of the verse and follow the interpretation, but not that we are to uproot the verse from its place and explain it as referring to another place. This is what appears to me to be correct in the meaning of this Scriptural section, so that the words of the Sages be upheld, and it is a fitting and appealing interpretation.</p>
<p>53. AND HE SHALL LET GO THE LIVING BIRD OUT OF THE CITY INTO THE OPEN FIELD, AND MAKE ATONEMENT FOR THE HOUSE, AND IT SHALL BE CLEAN. Now this atonement was effected by the bird which is to be sent away, the bird carrying away all his sins <italic>out of the city into the open field</italic>, like the atonement effected by the goat that is to be sent away.<sup><xref rid="fn1157">114</xref></sup> Now since the punishment of the plague which appears in a person&#x2019;s house is unlike [i.e., less in severity than] that of a plague which afflicts his body, Scripture did not make it necessary for him [the owner of the house] to bring a guilt-offering and sin-offering [as it required for the purification of a leper], because the first [stage of] atonement that the leper brings for his purification &#x2014; namely, the birds, the cedar-wood and the hyssop<sup><xref rid="fn1158">115</xref></sup> &#x2014; is sufficient for him [i.e., the owner of the house].</p>
<p>54. THIS IS THE LAW FOR ALL MANNER OF PLAGUE OF LEPROSY. This refers to leprosy of inflammation and the burnt part in the skin. Scripture mentioned them here first [although in the section on leprosy above they are not mentioned first]<sup><xref rid="fn1159">116</xref></sup> because of their frequency. Then it mentioned <italic>and for a scall</italic>, which is also frequent. Then Scripture mentioned here, <italic>and for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1160">117</xref></sup> followed by, <italic>and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1161">118</xref></sup> which are the first plagues with which Scripture opened this discussion: <italic>When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1162">119</xref></sup> Scripture always mentions the <italic>bahereth</italic> (bright spot) last, because it is the strongest and worst form of all the plagues.</p>
<h1>15</h1>
<p>11. AND WHOMSOEVER &#x2018;HAZAV&#x2019; (HE THAT HATH THE ISSUE) TOUCHETH, WITHOUT HAVING RINSED HIS HANDS IN WATER, HE SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES, AND BATHE HIMSELF IN WATER, AND BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN. Scripture calls the immersion [of the whole body of the impure object] &#x201C;rinsing in water,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1163">120</xref></sup> as is indicated by the verse here stating, <italic>and every vessel of wood</italic> [touched by a <italic>zav</italic>] <italic>shall be &#x2018;rinsed&#x2019; in water</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1164">121</xref></sup> [which means completely &#x201C;immersed&#x201D; in water], and similarly it calls the immersion of an [impure] garment &#x201C;washing,&#x201D; thus saying, <italic>then it shall be &#x2018;washed&#x2019; the second time, and shall be clean</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1165">122</xref></sup> The reason for these expressions is that it is necessary that there should be nothing interposing during the immersion [between the water and the utensil or the person], but he is to rinse his whole body in the water, even as the verse states, <italic>it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1166">123</xref></sup> similar to the expression, <italic>&#x2018;nachal shoteiph&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>an overflowing stream</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1167">124</xref></sup> And the meaning of the verse [here which specifies the hands] is because touching is done with the hands; therefore the verse states that when the <italic>zav</italic> touches anyone with his hands, and he has not &#x201C;rinsed&#x201D; them yet [i.e., &#x201C;immersed&#x201D; them, as explained above] by &#x201C;rinsing&#x201D; his whole body in water, that other person is impure. This is as if the verse had said, &#x201C;and whomsoever he that hath the issue toucheth with his hands, and he hath not yet bathed himself in water on the day of his purification, he shall wash his clothes, [and be impure until the even].&#x201D; Scripture had to use the term &#x201C;rinsing,&#x201D; in order to teach that the &#x201C;bathing&#x201D; it mentioned in the verse, <italic>and he shall bathe his flesh in running water</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1168">125</xref></sup> should be by means of rinsing and rubbing, so as to remove anything interposing [between the water and his body], as I have explained. It would not have been correct for Scripture to say that &#x201C;whomsoever he that has an issue touches, after having rinsed his hands in water, will <italic>not</italic> be rendered impure,&#x201D; [from which we would deduce that if he has not rinsed his hands in water, he shall be impure, thus indicating that his impurity is conveyed through his fingers], for He has already said, that whoever <italic>toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1169">126</xref></sup> meaning any part of the <italic>zav</italic>, is impure, the same law applying to objects that he lies on<sup><xref rid="fn1170">127</xref></sup> and rides on,<sup><xref rid="fn1171">128</xref></sup> and anything on which he sat,<sup><xref rid="fn1172">129</xref></sup> until he is purified of his issue, <italic>and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1168">125</xref></sup> Rather, Scripture [in using the term &#x201C;rinsing&#x201D;] alludes to his purification by means of complete immersion, as I have explained. And our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn1173">130</xref></sup> that Scripture expresses the immersion of the [whole] body of the <italic>zav</italic> by the term &#x201C;rinsing of hands,&#x201D; in order to teach you that the hidden parts of the body [such as the inside of the mouth, etc.] do not require &#x201C;the coming of water&#x201D; upon them, but only limbs which are visible, such as the hands.</p>
<p>The reason for the impurity of a man that suffers a flux is because it is a serious illness, and one of the contagious diseases. Therefore he requires an offering when healed in order to give thanks to G-d Who healed him and purified him [which is accomplished through the bird brought as a burnt-offering],<sup><xref rid="fn1174">131</xref></sup> and [in addition] he needs a sin-offering to effect atonement for his sin, so that it should not cause him any more sickness.</p>
<p>The reason for the impurity of semen,<sup><xref rid="fn1175">132</xref></sup> even though it is the nature of procreation, is analogous to the impurity of the dead, since the womb can be malfunctioning; thus the man does not know if his seed will be destroyed or a child will be born of it. When I will mention the reason for the impurity of the dead,<sup><xref rid="fn1176">133</xref></sup> with the help of Him Who takes life and gives life, the reason for the impurity of semen will be explained to you. I will also mention certain main principles when discussing the law of the menstruant.<sup><xref rid="fn1177">134</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Scripture was lenient in the case of a woman having an issue in her regular period, by not requiring her to bring an offering [as the <italic>zavah</italic>, the woman who sees blood outside her regular period, must do],<sup><xref rid="fn1178">135</xref></sup> because it is natural for her [to see blood at her period], and she is not healed of any sickness; rather, it declared her impure for seven days whether she saw [blood] for only one day or on all seven days.<sup><xref rid="fn1179">136</xref></sup> However, women do not by nature experience [the menstrual flow] for more than seven days, except when they have an extra flow on account of sickness. Thus when <italic>a woman has an issue of her blood many days out of the time</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1180">137</xref></sup> known to her, or if she adds to the time of those seven [menstrual] days, and has an issue of her blood for many more days, it is a form of sickness comparable to the flux of a man, and Scripture required her to bring an offering<sup><xref rid="fn1178">135</xref></sup> when she is healed, just as the <italic>zav</italic> has to bring.<sup><xref rid="fn1174">131</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Scripture has not mentioned immersion in the case of the woman. This is because after stating the law of the man that suffers a flux and his impurity, and then mentioning at the end, <italic>and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1168">125</xref></sup> it then went back and stated with reference to a woman, <italic>and if a woman have an issue</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1181">138</xref></sup> meaning just like a man that suffers a flux, <italic>her issue in her flesh be blood</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1181">138</xref></sup> not the white fluid as in a man; it then mentioned the impurity of the menstruant<sup><xref rid="fn1182">139</xref></sup> and the <italic>zavah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1183">140</xref></sup> followed by the statement concerning the <italic>zavah, and if she be cleansed of her issue</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1184">141</xref></sup> just as the <italic>zav</italic> is purified of his flux, <italic>then she shall number to herself seven days</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1184">141</xref></sup> just as the <italic>zav</italic> counts,<sup><xref rid="fn1168">125</xref></sup> <italic>and after that she shall be clean</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1184">141</xref></sup> [meaning] in the same way as the purity of the <italic>zav</italic> is effected [i.e., through immersion].</p>
<p>By way of the simple meaning of Scripture, a <italic>zavah</italic> would thus be required to have immersion <italic>in running water</italic> just like a <italic>zav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1168">125</xref></sup> [since the verse implies that her purity is attained in the same way as that of a <italic>zav</italic>], but the Sages have been lenient with regard to the impurity of a <italic>zavah</italic>, stating that she can become purified in the same way as all others who are purified of their impurity, namely, in the waters of a ritual pool [which do not have to be <italic>running</italic> water]. The reason [for their being lenient in the case of the impurity of a <italic>zavah</italic>] is because it was not necessary for Scripture to mention at all the expression, <italic>and after that she shall be clean</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1184">141</xref></sup> since the woman is included in the law of the man, and the verses were only necessary to mention the difference between a <italic>zav</italic> and <italic>zavah</italic>, that her flux must be of blood [and not white], and to distinguish between a flux in her regular period and outside the regular period. Therefore the Rabbis were of the opinion that [in the above phrase, <italic>and after that she shall be clean</italic>] Scripture intended to include an additional form of purification for her, saying, <italic>and after that she shall be clean</italic> like all those mentioned in the Torah, who are purified even without running water.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1044">(1) Verse 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1045">(2) Since the plague is a form of punishment, (see Ramban above, 13:47), the priest&#x2019;s visit to his habitation on the day that the affliction of leprosy is healed is an indication that his repentance has been accepted. Hence the Torah commands the priest to go to the person who had suffered the affliction, and not the other way (Klei Yakar).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1046">(3) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Metzora</italic> 1:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1047">(4) There is thus a distinct difference between the first interpretation, and that of the Torath Kohanim. At first we explained <italic>b&#x2019;yom tahoratho</italic> (<italic>on the day of his cleansing</italic>) as meaning: &#x201C;on the day that he is to be pronounced clean, he is to be brought to the priest, for no one else can so pronounce him&#x201D; (see Note 46 in <italic>Seder Tazria</italic>). But according to the Torath Kohanim the verse means: &#x201C;on the day he is actually &#x2018;cleansed&#x2019; of the sickness, i.e., on the day that he is physically healed of the affliction, there must be no delay and he is to be brought before the priest.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1050">(7) <italic>Treifah</italic> according to the accepted opinion (see Note 9 below), is an animal or bird suffering from one of certain organic diseases from which it is bound to die within twelve months, even though it be ritually slaughtered. Thus the word <italic>living</italic> excludes a bird which will die from a disease. Ramban further on will comment on this point.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1051">(8) Isaiah 10:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1052">(9) I.e., in Tractate Chullin 140a we find a difference of opinion among the Rabbis as to whether a <italic>treifah</italic> animal or bird can in fact survive for more than one year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1053">(10) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Metzora</italic> 1:12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1054">(11) In his commentary to the Torath Kohanim, Malbim explains this text as follows: &#x201C;First [the Tanna of this Beraitha] explains the simple meaning of the verse, saying: &#x2018;<italic>Living</italic> means not slaughtered; <italic>clean</italic> means not unfit for food.&#x2019; Then [the Tanna] says that according to the Midrash thereof, <italic>clean</italic> means not <italic>treifah</italic>, since that it may not be of a forbidden species, we know already from the word <italic>tzipor</italic>. This Sage further holds that a <italic>treifah</italic> can survive, and therefore birds which are <italic>treifah</italic> are not excluded by the word <italic>living</italic>,&#x201D; but instead are excluded by the term <italic>clean</italic>.</ftnote>

Now the emblem of the bird, as explained in the Gemara (41 a), is &#x201C;a symbol that [the idol in question] causes itself to be caught like a bird on behalf of the entire world.&#x201D; Hence the reference in the word <italic>tzipor</italic> must be to a small bird that can easily be caught. Rabbeinu Chananel explains the text of the Gemara in the following words: &#x201C;he holds the whole world in his hand as one holds a bird.&#x201D; Here too the reference is to a small bird that the holder can easily control in the palm of his hand.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1070">(27) Berachoth 57 b. Having proven that the term <italic>tzipor</italic> refers to a small bird, Ramban now begins to elucidate further that it means both a permissible and forbidden species of bird. Here in the text of Berachoth it definitely means a permissible bird, but further it will be shown that it may mean also a forbidden bird.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1071">(28) Deuteronomy 14:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1072">(29) Verse 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1073">(30) Ramban here alludes to a question that was raised in the Gemara (Chullin 140 a), as to whether the living bird of the leper that is sent into the open field is permissible to be eaten if caught by someone. To this the answer was given that one is permitted to eat it; for since the Torah stated <italic>&#x2018;All&#x2019; birds that are clean ye may eat</italic> (Deuteronomy 14:11), meaning any bird of a permissible species that is found may be eaten, now if the living bird of the leper were forbidden to be eaten, the Torah would not command the bird to be sent off, as this could involve a possible offense [since if the bird were not in fact permitted to be eaten, one might catch it without knowing that it had been used by the leper, and eat it]&#x0021; Now, concludes Ramban, this permission is based in the Talmud on the word &#x2018;all&#x2019; (&#x2018;<italic>All birds</italic> etc.) as explained above. This proves that the word <italic>tzipor</italic>, such as found here in the text before us, does not of itself only mean a permissible kind of bird. Rather, since it is a term for both the permissible and forbidden kind, it was therefore necessary for the Torath Kohanim here to establish that the leper&#x2019;s bird must be of a permissible species, from the word <italic>clean</italic> qualifying <italic>tziporim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1074">(31) Deuteronomy 14:12. Having established that the word <italic>tzipor</italic> means &#x201C;a small&#x201D; bird, whether of a permissible or forbidden kind, Ramban finds this verse difficult, since the expression <italic>of them</italic> [in translation of the verse: &#x201C;of which&#x201D;] apparently refers back to <italic>&#x2018;kol tzipor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>birds</italic>) mentioned in the previous verse [11], and yet it mentions here (in Verse 12) big birds like the great vulture, etc. In addition, the word <italic>tzipor</italic> in Verse 11 is explicitly qualified by the word <italic>&#x2018;t&#x2018;horah,&#x2019;</italic> thus excluding the great vulture. Ramban&#x2019;s answer follows in the text, where he explains that the expression <italic>of them</italic> does not refer back to <italic>&#x2018;kol tzipor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>all birds</italic>) previously mentioned, but rather means &#x201C;of their flesh,&#x201D; i.e., the flesh of these big birds about to be mentioned &#x2014; the great vulture, etc.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1087">(44) Yerushalmi Nazir I, 1. &#x2014; To understand the name &#x201C; &#x2018;Yerushalmi of Nazir,&#x201D; it is important to note that after the Mishnah was completed by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi &#x2014; also known as Rabbeinu Hakadosh &#x2014; in the Land of Israel [about the year 200 of Common Era] it formed, the basis of study in all academies of learning. But whereas hitherto all the great Yeshivoth were concentrated in the Land of Israel, after the completion of the Mishnah two groups of Yeshivoth came into prominence: those of the Land of Israel, and those of Babylon. Thus for a number of generations there existed side by side two groups of academies where the Mishnah was studied and interpreted. In the course of time, the continuous Roman persecutions forced the closing of the Palestinian schools of learning; but before they were finally closed, the Rabbis compiled their teachings in what is known as the <italic>Talmud Yerushalmi</italic> i.e., the Jerusalem Talmud. The academies in Babylon flourished for many centuries longer. Their teachings were later compiled [about the year 475 of Common Era] and are known as the Babylonian Talmud. To this day Talmudic study is almost exclusively devoted to the Babylonian Talmud, so that any tractate of the Talmud generally cited, is that of the Babylonian Talmud, unless specified as in the case before us: &#x201C;the Yerushalmi of Tractate&#x201D; so-and-so. A tradition has it that after the redaction of the Jerusalem Talmud, its Sages went down as a group to Babylon, and most of their teachings were incorporated into the text of the Babylonian Talmud. This explains why Talmudic study throughout the ages was concentrated almost entirely upon the Babylonian Talmud, while only the outstanding Rabbis of the generations devoted their studies also to the Jerusalem Talmud.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1088">(45) The question refers back to a statement in the Mishnah which reads: &#x201C;If a person said, &#x2018;I pledge myself to offer <italic>tziporim</italic> (birds),&#x2019; Rabbi Meir says that he becomes a Nazirite etc.&#x201D; The reason for this opinion of Rabbi Meir was explained there in the Gemara by Resh Lakish, that it is because a Nazirite whose consecration has been defiled, must bring <italic>tziporim</italic> as an atonement (Numbers 6:9-11). On this explanation of Resh Lakish, the Gemara asked: &#x201C;But does a Nazirite really bring <italic>tziporim</italic>? It is turtle-doves or young pigeons that he brings&#x0021;&#x201D; In other words, <italic>tziporim</italic> means birds which are of a forbidden kind, while the Nazirite must bring birds which are permissible to be eaten&#x0021; So how could the reason Resh Lakish advanced to explain Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s opinion be correct, since <italic>tziporim</italic> (forbidden birds) are not used at all by a Nazirite&#x0021; &#x2014; Ramban is thus beginning at this point to refute his own explanation which he had set forth, namely, that <italic>tzipor</italic> refers only to a permissible bird, since it is evident from the Yerushalmi that <italic>tzipor</italic> means a forbidden bird&#x0021; The final solution of the Yerushalmi follows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1089">(46) Hence he who said, &#x201C;I pledge myself to offer <italic>tziporim</italic>, becomes a Nazirite even according to those authorities that hold that the term <italic>tziporim</italic> denotes all kinds of birds, permissible ones or forbidden ones, for since it also denotes permissible birds, his intention was those birds that may be brought upon the altar (P&#x2019;nei Moshe).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1090">(47) Sotah 16 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1091">(48) Verse 5 here reads: <italic>And the priest shall command that one of the birds shall be slaughtered in an earthen vessel over running water</italic>. On this the Sages commented that the vessel must contain just enough water that the blood of the bird is discernible in it. And how much etc. (see text).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1092">(49) See text of Ramban above, quoting the Torath Kohanim at Note 34.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1093">(50) Shebuoth 29 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1094">(51) This text clearly shows that the term <italic>tzipor</italic> includes also large birds, and hence the above-mentioned explanation that it refers only to small birds is incorrect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1095">(52) Ramban&#x2019;s meaning is as follows. On this exclusion of forbidden birds by the Torath Kohanim one might ask: &#x201C;Since, as we have now established, the <italic>dror</italic>-characteristic of the bird is indispensable in the purification of the leper, meaning that if the birds did not have this quality of living in the house as well as in the field, the purification is invalid even if already done, why was it necessary for the Torath Kohanim to point to a special Scriptural source for the exclusion of forbidden birds; for such birds are not of the kind that live in the house as well as in the field, and we have said that if the birds lack this characteristic, the purification is invalid?&#x201D; Ramban answers that we must perforce say that even among forbidden birds there <italic>are</italic> some species that do have this characteristic of being able to live in the house as well as in the field, and hence it was necessary for the Torath Kohanim to exclude them by means of a special expression in the verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1096">(53) Mentioned above in the text, at Note 38.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1097">(54) Vayikra Rabbah 16:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1098">(55) &#x201C;If these birds that ate of his bread and drank of his water, effect atonement for the leper, how much more so do the priests who enjoy twenty-four kinds of gifts, effect atonement for Israel&#x0021;&#x201D; (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1099">(56) <italic>And he</italic> [Solomon] <italic>spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall</italic> (I Kings 5:13). The inference is clearly that Solomon&#x2019;s wisdom encompassed all vegetation, from highest to lowest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1100">(57) In each of these cases the cedar-wood and the hyssop are requirements in the process of purification. See further, 14:52 for the purification of a house that had been affected by leprosy, and Numbers 19:6 and 18, for the purification from the impurity conveyed by a corpse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1101">(58) Exodus 12:22. There the hyssop was required in the sprinkling of the blood upon the lintel and the two side-posts, so that the destroyer would not come into the Israelite houses. &#x2014; Ibn Ezra is thus intimating that in the cases of leprosy and impurity of a corpse, the purification was a sign that the destroyer would no longer approach that person or house, just as was its function in Egypt (Ezra L&#x2019;havin).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1108">(65) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Metzora</italic> 2:2-3.

<ftnote id="fn1136">(93) The Hebrew word is <italic>pasah</italic>, which is generally translated as &#x201C;spread.&#x201D; But Ramban has already explained above that in this section dealing with leprosy of a house, the term means &#x201C;recur&#x201D; and not &#x201C;spread.&#x201D; See Note 95.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1137">(94) Verse 45.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1138">(95) Ramban thus avoids a great exegetical difficulty which Rashi found in these verses. Principally it is as follows: Verse 44 states: <italic>And the priest shall come and see, and, behold, the plague be &#x2018;pasah&#x2019; in the house, it is a malignant leprosy; it is unclean</italic>. This is followed by Verse 45 which states: <italic>And he shall break down the house</italic> etc. Now Rashi, who interpreted the word <italic>pasah</italic> here in Verse 44 in the same way as in leprosy of man, meaning that &#x201C;it spread out,&#x201D; found this difficulty: since the Rabbis have said that every plague that recurs in a house after the removal of stones, scraping and replastering, is a sign of impurity, and requires the whole house to be demolished, why then does the verse state here <italic>pasah</italic>, since the same law applies even if the plague did not spread out? Accordingly Rashi transposed the order of the verses, placing Verse 45 [<italic>And he shall break down the house &#x2026;</italic>] after Verse 43 [<italic>And if the plague come again &#x2026;</italic>], and Verse 44 [<italic>And the priest shall come &#x2026;</italic>] after Verses 46 and 47 [<italic>and he that eateth in the house &#x2026;</italic>]. Ramban later remarks that this transposition of the verses is like &#x201C;cutting the verses with a knife.&#x201D; Ramban on the other hand explained the verses on these two premises: (a) the term <italic>pasah</italic> in this section on leprosy of a house, means &#x201C;recur,&#x201D; and not &#x201C;spread.&#x201D; (b) <italic>&#x2018;u&#x2019;va hakohein&#x2019;</italic> in Verse 44 does not mean &#x201C;<italic>then</italic> the priest shall come,&#x201D; or &#x201C;<italic>and</italic> the priest shall come,&#x201D; but rather &#x201C;<italic>or</italic> the priest shall come.&#x201D; Thus Verse 43 speaks of the recurrence of the plague at the end of the <italic>first</italic> week [after the removal of the stones etc.], and Verse 44 speaks of the case when it recurred at the end of the <italic>second</italic> week. In each of these cases the law is as stated in Verse 45: <italic>And he shall break down the house &#x2026;</italic> Thus according to Ramban all the verses are in order. The text of Ramban which follows sets forth this exposition in more detail.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1139">(96) Since Rashi explained the word <italic>pasah</italic> as &#x201C;spreading,&#x201D; he was also forced &#x2014; besides transposing Verse 44 [<italic>And the priest shall come and see &#x2026;</italic>] to follow after Verse 47 as mentioned above &#x2014; to explain that if at the end of the second week after the house was shut up, the priest found that the plague has spread then Verse 40 (&#x0021;) reapplies: <italic>then the priest shall command that they take out the stones &#x2026;</italic> and he gives it another week. If it returns, he demolishes the house, and if it does not return, it is pure. [[illegible]] It is this re-introduction of Verse 40 here in the order of the verses that Ramban finds unnecessary, as explained in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1140">(97) Verse 48.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1141">(98) Here too (in Verse 48) the word is <italic>pasah</italic>, which Rashi would explain as &#x201C;spread&#x201D; or &#x201C;extended&#x201D; [and it is so rendered in most translations], but Ramban explains it as meaning &#x201C;recur.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1142">(99) Reference is to Rashi&#x2019;s exposition of the verses. See above, Note 95.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1148">(105) Verses 43-45.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1149">(106) Literally: &#x201C;a similarity of phrases.&#x201D; It is one of the Thirteen principles of exegesis established by Rabbi Yishmael, by which the Torah is expounded (see above, Note 64). Thus where a similarity of phrases occurs in two different texts, the strictures mentioned in one text may equally apply to the second text, even though they are not mentioned there. It is important to note in this connection that an analogy from such congruent expressions cannot be established of one&#x2019;s own accord; it must be an authorized tradition that this similarity of phrases is to be applied, in order to establish such an analogy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1150">(107) This is clearly stated in Verse 40 with regard to the end of the first week. The above analogy establishes that the same law applies to the end of the second week, although it is not clearly specified.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1151">(108) Verse 48.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1152">(109) The root <italic>bo</italic> (coming) together with the verb <italic>yavo</italic> (he will come) suggest two &#x201C;comings&#x201D; &#x2014; thus making the priest&#x2019;s coming into the house to examine the status of the plague at the end of the third week, comparable in its law to that of his second visit, as explained in the text.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1155">(112) Verse 44. See also above, Note 98.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1156">(113) I.e., &#x201C;This is not the proper place of the verse, since that verse speaks of the case of a plague that remained as it was during the first week, to which the priest has therefore given a second week to be shut up, and at the end of the second week he comes and sees that it has spread.&#x201D; See above, Note 96, that Rashi transposed Verse 44 and read it after Verse 47. This is all predicated upon the interpretation of the term <italic>pasah</italic> as meaning &#x201C;spreading&#x201D; or &#x201C;extending.&#x201D; The phrase in the Torath Kohanim <italic>hanach lo</italic> (&#x201C;Leave it&#x201D;) is therefore interpreted as explained above [on the basis of the Rabad&#x2019;s commentary there, which follows Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation]. Ramban who has explained the term differently, as explained above in the text, is therefore bound to give a different interpretation of the expression in the Torath Kohanim, which now follows in the text: &#x201C;That is to say, that we are to leave etc.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1163">(120) Ramban&#x2019;s intention is to explain that in order that the <italic>zav</italic> become pure, he must immerse himself completely in water, this being implied in the term <italic>shataph</italic> (rinsing), as the following verse indicates. And the reason why Scripture uses the term &#x201C;rinsing,&#x201D; and why also it speaks here only of the hands having been rinsed, will be explained further on in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1164">(121) Verse 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1165">(122) Above, 13:58. Here too it does not mean merely washing the garment, but its immersion in a ritual pool. See Rashi <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>

<title>Acharei Moth</title>
<h1>16</h1>
<p>1. AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO MOSES, AFTER THE DEATH OF THE TWO SONS OF AARON. The meaning of the phrase <italic>after the death of the two sons of Aaron</italic>, is that immediately after the death of his sons He had warned Aaron against [drinking] wine or strong drink [when going into the Tent of Meeting], so that he should not die,<sup><xref rid="fn1185">1</xref></sup> and now He told Moses in addition to warn him so that he should not die when he draws near the Eternal [even in a sober condition, but at a time when he is not commanded to do so].<sup><xref rid="fn1186">2</xref></sup> It is likely that these two commandments were both conveyed on the day after the death of Aaron&#x2019;s sons, for on the actual day [when the deaths occurred, Aaron] was a mourner, and the holy spirit does not rest upon man in moments of sadness,<sup><xref rid="fn1187">3</xref></sup> and the communication concerning the prohibition against wine came to Aaron,<sup><xref rid="fn1188">4</xref></sup> and in that selfsame day this commandment [stated in the section before us] was also told to Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn1189">5</xref></sup> Scripture, however, preceded the prohibitions with which He warned Israel <italic>that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile My Tabernacle that is in the midst of them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1190">6</xref></sup> [before dealing with the commands specific to Aaron], and only afterwards He wrote the warning [applying to] the individual [i.e., this section, which was to be conveyed by Moses to Aaron, as the verse states: <italic>And the Eternal said unto Moses:</italic> &#x2018;<italic>Speak unto Aaron thy brother</italic> etc.&#x2019;].<sup><xref rid="fn1191">7</xref></sup> But in my opinion the whole Torah is written in consecutive order, and in all places where He changed the order, placing an earlier event in a later position, Scripture clearly states so, such as the verses: <italic>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses in Mount Sinai</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1192">8</xref></sup> [later on] in this book, [the laws of which were declared to Moses in the Tent of Meeting]; <italic>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the Tabernacle</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1193">9</xref></sup> in the following book [i.e., the Book of Numbers], and similar such statements. Therefore Scripture stated here <italic>after the death</italic>, in order to inform us that this [communication] was [given to Moses] immediately after the death of the two sons of Aaron [and according to the historical sequence of events, it should have been placed in Chapter 10 above, where the account of events following their death is given].</p>
<p>And in the opinion of our Rabbis who said<sup><xref rid="fn1194">10</xref></sup> [by way of a parable, that this verse can be compared to the case of a physician who warned his patient not to eat cold things or sleep in a damp place, and another physician warned him likewise but added]: &#x201C;so that you should not die as that person died;&#x201D; thus &#x201C;this [second physician] put him on his guard more than the first one,&#x201D; [according to this comment of the Rabbis] the meaning of the verse will be, that G-d said to Moses these words: &#x201C;<italic>After the death of the two sons of Aaron</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1195">11</xref></sup> <italic>when they drew near before the Eternal</italic>, speak to him <italic>that he come not at all times into the holy place &#x2026; that he die not</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>2. SPEAK UNTO AARON THY BROTHER. The meaning of the epithet <italic>thy brother</italic> is that &#x201C;you are to warn him because he is your brother, for even though you are not under this prohibition against coming [into the holy place at all times, thus you might think that Aaron, too, is not subject to this restriction, since he is your brother, nonetheless] Aaron, your brother, <italic>is</italic> under the prohibition against coming [into the holy place at all times].&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that this Scriptural section indicates that Aaron&#x2019;s sons [died because they] brought the fire of incense into the innermost part of the Sanctuary.<sup><xref rid="fn1196">12</xref></sup> But in my opinion this is not correct. For the verses which mention their sin always say, <italic>when they offered &#x2018;strange&#x2019; fire before the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1197">13</xref></sup> And if [you accept as] proof that they entered into the innermost part of the Sanctuary, the prohibition with which G-d warned Moses concerning their father [i.e., Aaron], so that he die not [as Ibn Ezra said], then [you should] certainly accept as proof [that they died because] they entered the Sanctuary whilst intoxicated by wine, the prohibition that was said to Aaron himself immediately after their death, [<italic>Drink no wine nor strong drink</italic> etc.]&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1185">1</xref></sup> Moreover, how could it have occurred to them to enter on that day the [innermost] part [of the Sanctuary] which [even] their father did not enter, for Aaron burnt the incense on the &#x201C;inner&#x201D; altar [which stood in the Sanctuary proper], and why should they bring in their incense to a place further inside [the Sanctuary] than their father&#x0021; Now I have already hinted at the nature of their sin,<sup><xref rid="fn1198">14</xref></sup> and the language of the verses point thereto. But the expression <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;korvatham&#x2019;</italic> (when they approached) [does not mean, as Ibn Ezra interpreted it, &#x201C;<italic>when they approached</italic> by entering the innermost part of the holy place&#x201D;, but] according to its plain meaning is like the expression <italic>&#x2018;uv&#x2019;korvatham&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and when they come near</italic>) <italic>to the altar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1199">15</xref></sup> <italic>to minister</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1200">16</xref></sup> Thus the verse here is stating that Aaron&#x2019;s sons died when they ministered before G-d. If so, [the sense of the warning here] is that He warned Aaron that he should only minister in the place which He commands [that it be done], and at the time He specifies for it.</p>
<p>It is possible that the sense of the verse is similar to that which our Rabbis have said,<sup><xref rid="fn1201">17</xref></sup> that the people were speaking perversely of the incense, saying, &#x201C;Through it Nadab and Abihu [Aaron&#x2019;s sons] died etc.&#x201D; Therefore Scripture stated that <italic>after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the Eternal</italic> with the incense, He said to Aaron that he should come even nearer before the Eternal than they did, and <italic>with</italic> incense, for if he comes into the holy place [i.e., the Holy of Holies] <italic>without</italic> the incense, he will die, for with it he shall enter there first, just as He said, <italic>and he shall bring it within the Veil &#x2026; and the cloud of the incense will cover the ark-cover that is upon the testimony, that he die not</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1202">18</xref></sup> This then is the meaning of the phrase [here in Verse 2 before us], <italic>for I will appear in the cloud upon the ark-cover</italic>, meaning that he [Aaron now, and the High Priest in succeeding generations] is only to enter there with the incense whose cloud rises up there [upon the ark-cover], even as He said, <italic>and the cloud of the incense will cover the ark-cover</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1203">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT HE COME NOT AT ALL TIMES INTO THE HOLY PLACE WITHIN THE VEIL. The meaning of the expression <italic>at all times</italic> is that since He had already mentioned the Day of Atonement, saying, <italic>And Aaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it</italic> [i.e., the golden altar which stood within the Sanctuary ] <italic>once in the year</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1204">20</xref></sup> therefore He stated here that Aaron is not to come at any time <italic>into the holy place</italic> [<italic>within the Veil</italic>], except <italic>with this</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1205">21</xref></sup> [procedure], that is to say, on the day that he brings these offerings to effect atonement. Later on in this section He explains with what Aaron shall enter, just as He said, <italic>and he shall bring it within the Veil</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1206">22</xref></sup> and then He specifies the day, that it be <italic>in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1207">23</xref></sup> and then He states again that it be [only] <italic>once in the year</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1208">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The secret of <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;zoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>With this</italic>) <italic>shall Aaron come into the holy place</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1205">21</xref></sup> is analogous to the secret of <italic>&#x2018;zoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>this is</italic>) <italic>the token of the covenant which I have established</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1209">25</xref></sup> I have already explained it.<sup><xref rid="fn1210">26</xref></sup> Our Rabbis alluded to it in saying in Vayikra Rabbah:<sup><xref rid="fn1211">27</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Yudan explained the verse [<italic>&#x2018;With this&#x2019; shall Aaron come into the holy place</italic>] with reference to the High Priest when entering the Holy of Holies: he came with many bundles of commandments [fulfilled by Israel] in his possession. He came in there by merit of [their studying] Torah, as it is said, <italic>and &#x2018;this&#x2019; is the law;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1212">28</xref></sup> by merit of circumcision, as it is said, <italic>&#x2018;This&#x2019; is My covenant, which ye shall keep;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1213">29</xref></sup> by merit of keeping the Sabbath, as it is said, <italic>Happy is the man that doeth &#x2018;this&#x2019;</italic> [<italic>&#x2026; that keepeth the Sabbath</italic>];<sup><xref rid="fn1214">30</xref></sup> by the guarding influence of Jerusalem, as it is said, <italic>&#x2018;This&#x2019; is Jerusalem;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1215">31</xref></sup> by the guarding influence of the [twelve] tribes, as it is said, <italic>and &#x2018;this&#x2019; is that their father spoke unto them;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1216">32</xref></sup> by the guarding influence of Judah, as it is said, <italic>And &#x2018;this&#x2019;</italic> [Moses said] <italic>for Judah;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1217">33</xref></sup> by the guarding influence of the congregation of Israel, as it is said, <italic>&#x2018;This&#x2019; thy stature is like to a palm-tree;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1218">34</xref></sup> by merit of [Israel having observed the law of] the heave-offering, as it is said, <italic>And &#x2018;this&#x2019; is &#x2018;ha&#x2019;terumah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the offering</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn1219">35</xref></sup> by the merit of [Israel giving] the tithes, as it is said, <italic>and try Me now with &#x2018;this;&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1220">36</xref></sup> by the merit of bringing the offerings, as it is said, <italic>With &#x2018;this&#x2019; shall Aaron come</italic>.&#x201D; This text requires a lengthy exposition, but it is all explained in our commentary [in various places].<sup><xref rid="fn1221">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. HE SHALL PUT ON THE LINEN TUNIC OF &#x2018;KODESH&#x2019; (HOLINESS). &#x201C;This means that they [i.e., all the garments of the High Priest] must be of the Sanctuary [treasury, and not of his own possession].&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.<sup><xref rid="fn1222">38</xref></sup> Thus the following phrase which states, <italic>they are garments of &#x2018;kodesh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>holiness</italic>) must therefore mean that all the garments [even those of the ordinary priests], must come from the Sanctuary [treasury]. And [so] it is stated in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn1223">39</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>&#x2018;Kodesh yilbash&#x2019;</italic> (&#x2018;He shall put on&#x2019; the linen tunic &#x2018;of holiness&#x2019;), this means that these [garments of the High Priest] are to be of the Sanctuary. From this phrase I would only know concerning these garments [i.e., the four garments worn by the High Priest when he ministered in the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement]. Whence do I know to include the other garments of the High Priest [i.e., the eight golden garments in which he officiated throughout the year], and the garments of his brethren the priests [that they too must all come from the Temple treasury]? Scripture therefore says, <italic>they are garments of &#x2018;kodesh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>holiness</italic>). It is a conclusion by analogy that all garments [worn by all priests] should be of the Temple treasury&#x201D; [since they all come under the term <italic>&#x2018;garments of holiness&#x2019;</italic>].</p>
<p>By way of the simple meaning of Scripture, just as He said, <italic>and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1224">40</xref></sup> referring to the eight [golden] garments, He states that these [four garments worn by the High Priest on the Day of Atonement] are also holy garments. Their secret is analogous to <italic>the man clothed in linen</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1225">41</xref></sup> and therefore He informed him that <italic>they are holy garments</italic>. And in Vayikra Rabbah the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1226">42</xref></sup> &#x201C;As the Service performed Above, so is the Service below. Just as of the Service Above it is said, <italic>one man in the midst of them clothed in linen</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1227">43</xref></sup> so of the Service below it is said, <italic>he shall put on the holy linen tunic</italic>.</p>
<p>HE SHALL PUT ON &#x2026; HE SHALL BE GIRDED &#x2026; HE SHALL BE ATTIRED.<sup><xref rid="fn1228">44</xref></sup> [The Scriptural use of these multiple expressions is] explained by the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn1229">45</xref></sup> &#x201C;Since we are finally bound to include [among the requirements for the Service on the Day of Atonement] another set of [four linen] garments [when he brought out the spoon and censer from the Holy of Holies] in the afternoon of that day, then I might think that if he has no other set of garments he should not put on those he wore in the morning [when he first entered the Holy of Holies]. Scripture therefore says <italic>he shall put on &#x2026; he shall be girded &#x2026; he shall be attired</italic>&#x201D; [thus indicating by the multiple use of these expressions that the High Priest may wear these vestments again in the afternoon].</p>
<p>Now Rashi commented: &#x201C;<italic>&#x2018;Yitznoph&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he shall be attired</italic>). [The word is to be understood as the Targum rendered it:] <italic>yocheith b&#x2019;reishei</italic> which means &#x201C;he shall &#x2018;place&#x2019; it upon his head.&#x201D; This is like <italic>&#x2018;vatanach&#x2019; his garment by her</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1230">46</xref></sup> which the Targum rendered &#x2018;<italic>v&#x2019;achthethei</italic>,&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;and she &#x2018;placed&#x2019; [his garment by her].&#x201D; But Onkelos&#x2019; opinion [in translating the Hebrew word <italic>yitznoph</italic> as &#x201C;placing&#x201D;] is not clear to me, for the term <italic>tzniphah</italic> means &#x201C;winding&#x201D; [something] around the head like a turban,<sup><xref rid="fn1231">47</xref></sup> so why did he translate it merely as &#x201C;placing,&#x201D; and did not render it by an [Aramaic] word which is used specifically for actual &#x201C;winding&#x201D;? Perhaps there is no equivalent expression for it in the Aramaic language, for even the expression in [the Book of] Isaiah, <italic>&#x2018;hatzniphoth&#x2019; and the mantles</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1232">48</xref></sup> Yonathan ben Uziel rendered <italic>kitoraya</italic> (&#x201C;crownings&#x201D; surrounding the head). Thus both [Onkelos and Yonathan] had no Aramaic equivalent for <italic>tzniph</italic> [in the Book of Isaiah] <italic>and mitznepheth</italic> [in the Torah &#x2014; Exodus 28:4], and therefore both of them used the same term derived from the Sacred Language &#x2014; <italic>mitznephta</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1233">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND THE OTHER LOT FOR AZAZEL. &#x201C;This was a high mountain &#x2014; a flinty precipitous peak, as it is said, <italic>a land which is cut off</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1234">50</xref></sup> This is the language of Rashi. And in the Torath Kohanim [the Rabbis have said]:<sup><xref rid="fn1235">51</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>For Azazel</italic>. This means the &#x2018;hardest&#x2019; place in the mountains. I might think that it refers to an inhabited place; Scripture therefore says <italic>into the wilderness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1236">52</xref></sup> Whence do we know that it be a precipitous peak? Scripture therefore says, <italic>unto a land which is cut off</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1234">50</xref></sup> Accordingly the meaning of the word <italic>la&#x2019;azazel</italic> is to &#x201C;a hard&#x201D; place, [the root of the word <italic>azazel</italic> being <italic>az</italic> &#x2014; strong], with the letter <italic>za&#x2019;yin</italic> doubled just like <italic>&#x2018;izuz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>strong</italic>) <italic>and mighty</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1237">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote: &#x201C;Said Rav Shmuel:<sup><xref rid="fn1238">54</xref></sup> &#x2018;Although it is [only] with reference to the goat of the sin-offering that it is written [explicitly] that it was <italic>for the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1239">55</xref></sup> the goat which was sent away [to Azazel] was also for the Eternal.&#x2019; But there is no need for this [comment]. For the goat which was sent away was not an &#x201C;offering&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1240">56</xref></sup> since it was not slaughtered. Now if you can understand the secret of the word after &#x2018;Azazel,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1241">57</xref></sup> you will know its secret [that of Azazel] and the secret of its name,<sup><xref rid="fn1242">58</xref></sup> since it has companions in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1243">59</xref></sup> And I will reveal to you part of the secret by hint: when you will be at thirty-three<sup><xref rid="fn1244">60</xref></sup> you will know it.&#x201D; [Thus far are the words of Ibn Ezra]. Now of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra it may be said that <italic>he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1245">61</xref></sup> and I will not be <italic>the talebearer who revealeth</italic> his secret,<sup><xref rid="fn1246">62</xref></sup> since our Rabbis of blessed memory have already revealed it in many places. Thus they have said in Bereshith Rabbah:<sup><xref rid="fn1247">63</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And the &#x2018;sa&#x2019;ir&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1248">64</xref></sup> <italic>shall carry upon him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1249">65</xref></sup> this is a reference to Esau, as it is said, <italic>Behold, Esau my brother is a man who is &#x2018;sa&#x2019;ir&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>hairy</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1250">66</xref></sup> <italic>All &#x2018;avonotham&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>their iniquities</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1249">65</xref></sup> [read]: <italic>&#x2018;avonoth tam&#x2019;</italic> (the sins of him who has been called <italic>tam</italic>, &#x2018;a man of integrity&#x2019;), as it is said, <italic>and Jacob was a man &#x2018;tam&#x2019;</italic> (&#x2018;of integrity&#x2019;).&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1251">67</xref></sup> It is explained more clearly in the Chapters of the great Rabbi Eliezer:<sup><xref rid="fn1252">68</xref></sup> &#x201C;The reason why<sup><xref rid="fn1253">69</xref></sup> they would give Sammael [i.e., Satan] a conciliatory gift on the Day of Atonement, was so that he should not annul [the effect of] their offerings, as it is said, <italic>one lot for the Eternal, and the other lot for Azazel</italic>, the lot of the Holy One, blessed by He, to be a burnt-offering,<sup><xref rid="fn1254">70</xref></sup> and the lot of Azazel to be &#x2018;the goat of sin,&#x2019; bearing upon it all the iniquities of Israel, as it is said, <italic>And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1255">71</xref></sup> When Sammael saw that he could find no sin on the Day of Atonement amongst them [the children of Israel], he said to the Holy One, blessed by He: &#x2018;Master of all worlds&#x0021; You have one people on earth who are comparable to the ministering angels in the heavens. Just as the ministering angels are barefooted, so are the Israelites barefooted [i.e., do not wear leather shoes] on the Day of Atonement. Just as the ministering angels do not eat or drink, so is there no eating or drinking in Israel on the Day of Atonement. Just as the ministering angels have no joints [in their feet, and therefore cannot sit or lie down], so do the Israelites stand on their feet on the Day of Atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn1256">72</xref></sup> Just as there is peace in the midst of the ministering angels, so do the Israelites bring peace among themselves on the Day of Atonement. Just as the ministering angels are free from all sin, so are the Israelites free from all sin on the Day of Atonement.&#x2019; And the Holy One, blessed be He, hears the testimony concerning Israel from their prosecutor, and He atones for the altar and for the Sanctuary, <italic>and for the priests and for all the people of the assembly</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1257">73</xref></sup> as it is said, <italic>And he shall make atonement for the most holy place</italic> etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1257">73</xref></sup> Thus far is the language of this Agadah (tradition) in which the Rabbis have informed us of his name [i.e., Sammael] and the nature of his deeds.</p>
<p>Now this is the secret of the matter. They used to worship &#x201C;other gods,&#x201D; namely, the angels, bringing offerings of a sweet savor to them, similarly to that which it says, <italic>and thou didst set Mine oil and My incense before them. My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savor, and thus it was; saith the Eternal G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1258">74</xref></sup> You have to contemplate the Scriptural text as it is written and [also] as [it is read according to the] Masoretic tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn1259">75</xref></sup> Now the Torah has absolutely forbidden to accept them as deities, or to worship them in any manner. However, the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded us that on the Day of Atonement we should let loose a goat in the wilderness, to that &#x201C;prince&#x201D; [power] which rules over wastelands, and this [goat] is fitting for it because he is its master, and destruction and waste emanate from that power, which in turn is the cause of the stars of the sword, wars, quarrels, wounds, plagues, division and destruction. In short, it is the spirit of the sphere of Mars, and its portion among the nations is Esau [Rome], the people that inherited the sword and the wars, and among animals [its portion consists of] the <italic>se&#x2019;irim</italic> (demons) and the goats. Also in its portion are the devils called &#x201C;destroyers&#x201D; in the language of our Rabbis, and in the language of Scripture: <italic>se&#x2019;irim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1260">76</xref></sup> (satyrs, demons), for thus he [i.e., Esau] and his nation were called <italic>sa&#x2019;ir</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1261">77</xref></sup> Now the intention in our sending away the goat to the desert was not that it should be an offering from us to it &#x2014; Heaven forbid&#x0021; Rather, our intention should be to fulfill the wish of our Creator, Who commanded us to do so. This may be compared to the case of someone who makes a feast for his master, and the master commands the person making the feast, &#x201C;Give one portion to that servant of mine,&#x201D; in which case the host gives nothing [of his own] to that servant, and it is not to show him honor that he acts in that way to him, but everything is given to the master and it is the master that gives a gift to his servant; the host only observes his command and does in honor of the master whatever he commanded him to do. The master, however, out of his own compassion for the host, wanted all his servants to derive some enjoyment from it [the feast], in order that they may all speak of his [the host&#x2019;s] praise and not of his shortcomings.</p>
<p>This then is the reason [for having someone] who casts the lots [on the two goats]. If the priest were to dedicate them merely, by word of mouth [without casting the lots], saying, &#x201C;one for the Eternal&#x201D; and &#x201C;one for Azazel,&#x201D; that would be like worshipping [Azazel] or taking a vow in its name.<sup><xref rid="fn1262">78</xref></sup> Rather, the priest <italic>set</italic> the two goats <italic>before the Eternal at the door of the Tent of Meeting</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1263">79</xref></sup> for both of them were a gift to G-d, and he gave to His servant that portion which came to him from G-d. It is he [i.e., the priest] who cast the lots on them, but it is His hand that apportioned them, something like that which it says, <italic>The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing of it is of the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1264">80</xref></sup> Even after the casting of the lots, the priest placed the two goats <italic>before the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1265">81</xref></sup> thus proclaiming that both are His and that by sending one away [to the desert] we intend merely to fulfill G-d&#x2019;s wish, just as it said, <italic>And the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive &#x2018;before the Eternal,&#x2019; to make atonement over him, to send him away</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1265">81</xref></sup> That is the reason why we do not ourselves do any act of slaughtering [of that goat, as this would imply that it is a proper offering which requires slaughtering]. And Onkelos rendered the expression (<italic>one lot for the Eternal, and one lot for Azazel</italic>) as: &#x201C;one lot for &#x2018;the Name of&#x2019; the Eternal and one lot for Azazel;&#x201D; [thus he was careful not to translate &#x201C;and one lot <italic>for the name of</italic> Azazel&#x201D;], because the one was &#x201C;for the Name of the Eternal&#x201D; and not for him [Azazel], and the second was &#x201C;for Azazel&#x201D; but not &#x201C;for the name of Azazel.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is for this reason that our Rabbis have interpreted:<sup><xref rid="fn1266">82</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And My statutes shall ye keep</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1267">83</xref></sup> These are matters against which the evil inclination raises accusations, and the idolaters likewise bring charges, such as the [prohibition against] wearing clothes made of a mixture of wool and linen, [the law of] the Red Heifer, and of the goat that is sent away [to Azazel].&#x201D; Now these idolaters have not accused us [according to our Rabbis] in connection with the offerings, for these are <italic>the fire-offerings unto the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1268">84</xref></sup> But they accuse us in connection with the goat that is sent away [to Azazel], because they think that we act as they do. Similarly they accuse us in connection with the Red Heifer, because it is slaughtered <italic>without the camp</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1269">85</xref></sup> but [in truth] the purport thereof is analogous to that of the goat sent away [to Azazel], which is to remove the spirit of impurity, as it is said of the future, <italic>And also I will cause the</italic> [false] <italic>prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the Land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1270">86</xref></sup> On this basis you will understand the reason why the person who sent forth the goat to Azazel must wash his garments [as they were rendered impure],<sup><xref rid="fn1271">87</xref></sup> and likewise he who burns the Red Heifer,<sup><xref rid="fn1272">88</xref></sup> and what our Rabbis have mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn1273">89</xref></sup> concerning the requirement of washing the garments [of those priests who are in charge] of the burning of the bulls and he-goats which were to be wholly burnt [outside the camp, i.e., outside the city of Jerusalem].<sup><xref rid="fn1274">90</xref></sup> Thus Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra intimated to you that you will know the secret of [sending away the goat to Azazel] when you reach the verse, <italic>And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1275">91</xref></sup> The word [Azazel] is a compound one [made of two words].<sup><xref rid="fn1276">92</xref></sup> There are many such cases. Thus the matter is explained, unless you pursue a further investigation from this subject to that of the Separate Intelligences<sup><xref rid="fn1277">93</xref></sup> and how the spirits [are affected by] the offerings &#x2014; [the influence upon the spirits] being known through the study of necromancy,<sup><xref rid="fn1278">94</xref></sup> while that of the [Separate] Intelligences is known by means of certain allusions of the Torah to those who understand their secrets. I cannot explain more, for I would have to close the mouths of those who claim to be wise in the study of nature, following after that Greek [philosopher Aristotle] who denied everything except that which could be perceived by him [through the physical senses], and he, and his wicked disciples, were so proud as to suspect<sup><xref rid="fn1279">95</xref></sup> that whatever he could not conceive of through his reasoning is not true&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1280">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND HE SHALL GO OUT UNTO THE ALTAR THAT IS BEFORE THE ETERNAL AND MAKE ATONEMENT FOR IT, etc. The sprinklings before the ark-cover [in the Holy of Holies]<sup><xref rid="fn1281">97</xref></sup> effected atonement for impurity that befell the innermost part of the Sanctuary and its hallowed things. The sprinklings in front of the Veil in the Tent of Meeting [which divided between the holy place and the most holy],<sup><xref rid="fn1282">98</xref></sup> effected atonement for impurity that befell the Sanctuary and its holy things, such as the candelabrum, the table, the showbread, and the Veil itself. The applications of the blood upon [the horns of] the inner altar and the [seven] sprinklings upon its top<sup><xref rid="fn1283">99</xref></sup> effected atonement for impurity that befell this altar itself and its holy things, such as the incense [which was burnt on it twice daily]. It is for this reason that Scripture divided them [these three parts of the Service] and mentioned &#x201C;atonement&#x201D; in each case.<sup><xref rid="fn1284">100</xref></sup> In the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis derived this interpretation from a verse written at the end [of this part of the Service], <italic>And when he hath finished making an atonement for the holy place, and the Tent of Meeting, and the altar</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1285">101</xref></sup> On this verse the Rabbis commented:<sup><xref rid="fn1286">102</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Making an atonement for the holy place</italic>, this refers to the innermost part of the Sanctuary [i.e., the Holy of Holies]. <italic>The Tent of Meeting</italic>, this is the Sanctuary. <italic>The altar</italic>, that is the inner altar. This teaches that they are each a separate act of atonement. From this the Sages have deduced that if [the High Priest] made some of the applications of the blood within [the Holy of Holies], and the blood then became spilt, he must bring other blood and start again with the applications [done] within [the Holy of Holies]. But if he <italic>finished</italic> the applications within [the Holy of Holies], and the blood then became spilt, he must bring other blood and start again with the applications [done] on [the Veil] outside<sup><xref rid="fn1287">103</xref></sup> [in the Sanctuary]. If he finished the applications outside [in the Sanctuary] and the blood then became spilt, he must bring other blood and start again with the applications on the altar, etc. [since they are each a separate act of atonement].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1288">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND HE SHALL PUT THEM UPON THE HEAD OF THE GOAT. Such an expression is not used with reference to the bullock of Aaron [over which he confessed his own sins and those of the other priests], nor in relation to the goat of the sin-offering of the Eternal, nor regarding the leaning of hands upon any of the offerings. This is because all offerings were brought for acceptance <italic>upon the fires of G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1268">84</xref></sup> [which burnt on the altar], and thus they effected pardon and atonement. But this [goat that was sent away to Azazel], since it was not for G-d, and the recipient thereof [i.e. Sammael] has no power to offer atonement or pardon, therefore the goat merely carries the people&#x2019;s sins away, and [the accusing angel] must answer &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; against his will.<sup><xref rid="fn1289">105</xref></sup> When the Israelites are free from all sins and transgressions [as after the moment of confession of sins over the goat sent to Azazel], he indeed carries their sins away, as is mentioned in many verses in the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn1290">106</xref></sup> and the prophets. This then is [the meaning of the expression], <italic>and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1291">107</xref></sup> That was the reason why the thread of crimson wool<sup><xref rid="fn1292">108</xref></sup> turned white at the time when the goat was sent away to Azazel, i.e., at the moment that he pushed it over the cliff, when it was broken in pieces, as is mentioned in the words of the Sages.<sup><xref rid="fn1293">109</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND AARON SHALL COME INTO THE TENT OF MEETING. &#x201C;Our Rabbis have said that this is not the proper place of this verse [which ought rather to follow Verse 25], and they explained the reason for their saying so in Tractate Yoma,<sup><xref rid="fn1294">110</xref></sup> stating: The whole section is written according to the procedure [which was actually followed in the Service on the Day of Atonement], except for this &#x2018;coming&#x2019; [of the High Priest into the Holy of Holies] which was actually done after he offered his burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of the people [stated in Verse 24], and after the burning of the fats of the bullock [of Aaron] and the goat [of the sin-offering of the people], which rites were performed outside the Sanctuary [proper, as stated in Verse 25, i.e., in the Sanctuary Court, and therefore done by the High Priest dressed] in golden garments. [It was only after he had done these things that] he immersed himself [in a ritual pool] and washed his hands and feet and took them [the golden garments] off,<sup><xref rid="fn1295">111</xref></sup> and put on the linen garments, and then he came into the Tent of Meeting [as mentioned in our verse] to take out [from the Holy of Holies] the spoon and the censer in which he had burnt the incense in the innermost part of the Sanctuary. <italic>And then he shall put off the linen garments</italic> after he had taken them [the spoon and the censer] out, and attires himself in his golden clothes for the Daily burnt-offering brought in the afternoon.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1296">112</xref></sup> All this is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>Now this is truly a case where the verse calls aloud for elucidation. For it is not at all conceivable that [the verse] should command that Aaron come into the Tent of Meeting for no purpose whatsoever other than that of taking off his garments<sup><xref rid="fn1297">113</xref></sup> and being naked in G-d&#x2019;s temple, and that he should leave the garments there to decay&#x0021; Rather, we must perforce interpret the verse thus: <italic>And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting</italic> to do some act of the Service which Scripture found it unnecessary to mention, that is, the removal of the spoon and the censer [which he had left in the Holy of Holies when he had burnt the incense there]. The explanation of the [order of the] verses is thus as follows. Having mentioned at first, <italic>And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Eternal, that the cloud of the incense may cover the ark-cover that is upon the testimony, that he die not</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1298">114</xref></sup> meaning to say that he is to place the incense upon the fire until the cloud of the incense goes up, and then he is to go out immediately, leaving there the spoon [in which he had carried the incense] and the censer [which contained the coals of fire, and upon which the incense was now burning], and which he would in any case have to remove later on from there, Scripture therefore says, <italic>and Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting</italic> in order to enter within the Veil [and to bring out] the things he had left there. Now the Scriptural section here did not mention all that the priest did at the beginning when [attired] in the golden garments, such as the [offering of the] Daily burnt-offering of the morning,<sup><xref rid="fn1296">112</xref></sup> but rather it began with the [special] Service performed on the Day of Atonement, which was done in the white [linen] garments, and it arranged the following procedure [of things to be done in these garments]: burning of incense within the Holy of Holies, the [rites of the] bullock [of Aaron] and of the goat [whose blood was sprinkled] within [the Holy of Holies], and the matter of the goat that was sent away to Azazel. All these rites were done in one order, and there was nothing left to be performed in these [white linen] garments except for the bringing out of the spoon and the censer [from the Holy of Holies]. Now it is always the custom of Scripture to finish a subject which it began, although there may be some matters which took place after that which it mentions later [as here, where the removal of the spoon and censer took place after the events of Verses 24-28, but is referred to before, in Verse 23, to finish the subject of the events done in the white garments]. Therefore Scripture states, <italic>and Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting</italic> in these [white linen] garments, to complete his Service, namely, the bringing out of the spoon and the censer which he has to remove from there, and after he came out from there <italic>he shall put off</italic> his garments <italic>which he put on</italic> in the morning at the time <italic>when he went into the holy place, and he shall leave them there</italic> where he took them off, thus teaching us that he is not to use them again on a subsequent Day of Atonement. Therefore Scripture completed in one sequence everything that was to be done during the whole day in the white garments. [Thus Scripture mentions the removal of the spoon and censer here in Verse 23, although it actually took place only later after the events mentioned in Verses 24-28, in order to complete in one sequence all the events done in the white garments]. Then it went back and said, <italic>and he shall bathe his flesh in water &#x2026; and put on his other vestments</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1299">115</xref></sup> i.e., those garments which are known to him from his ministry during the whole year, thus teaching that [whenever he changes on that day] from one set of garments to another, he had to immerse himself [in a ritual pool]. Then Scripture states, <italic>and &#x2018;he shall come forth,&#x2019; and offer his burnt-offering</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1299">115</xref></sup> for everything that had been done hitherto in the white garments is considered &#x201C;the Service within [the Sanctuary],&#x201D; while his ram<sup><xref rid="fn1300">116</xref></sup> and the ram of the people<sup><xref rid="fn1301">117</xref></sup> [which are the burnt-offerings] that He mentions [here in Verse 24: <italic>and he shall come forth, and offer his burnt-offering of the people</italic>], were done on the outer altar. Thus the section mentioned the High Priest&#x2019;s first attirement in the white garments, and required him to immerse himself [first in a ritual pool],<sup><xref rid="fn1302">118</xref></sup> and then it mentioned the final removal of these garments [after taking out the spoon and censer from the Holy of Holies], and required him to immerse himself [before he puts on the golden garments for the performance of the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon]. Thus we learn that he had to immerse himself [in a ritual pool] whenever there was a change of the garments.</p>
<p>Now in the opinion of Rashi this immersion of the High Priest for the bringing out of the spoon and the censer, took place after he had offered his ram and the ram of the people; [that is to say], between the Additional Offerings<sup><xref rid="fn1303">119</xref></sup> and the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon. This is also the opinion of all the Gaonim,<sup><xref rid="fn1304">120</xref></sup> and it would likewise so appear from the plain meaning of a Beraitha<sup><xref rid="fn1305">121</xref></sup> taught in the Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn1306">122</xref></sup> But we have found in the Yerushalmi:<sup><xref rid="fn1307">123</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Yochanan said, &#x2018;All Sages agree that the taking out of the spoon and the censer [from the Holy of Holies] was done <italic>after</italic> [the slaughtering of] the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon.&#x2019;&#x201D; And so did Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon] write.<sup><xref rid="fn1308">124</xref></sup> So also is the procedure taught in our Mishnah [following the High Priest&#x2019;s removal of the spoon and the censer]:<sup><xref rid="fn1309">125</xref></sup> &#x201C;He washed his hands and feet, took off [his white garments], went down and immersed himself, and they brought him the golden garments &#x2026; and he went into [the Sanctuary] to burn the [daily] incense of the afternoon.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1310">126</xref></sup> Rather, the order was as follows: The [special] Service of the Day of Atonement was performed in the white garments;<sup><xref rid="fn1311">127</xref></sup> his [the High Priest&#x2019;s] ram and the ram of the people, the Additional Offerings,<sup><xref rid="fn1303">119</xref></sup> the [burning of the] fats of the sin-offering,<sup><xref rid="fn1312">128</xref></sup> and [the slaughtering of] the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon were all done in the golden garments following the [High Priest&#x2019;s] third immersion; the taking out of the spoon and censer [from the Holy of Holies] was done in the white garments following the fourth immersion, while the [daily] burning of the incense of [the afternoon], the [daily] offering of the High Priest&#x2019;s cakes,<sup><xref rid="fn1313">129</xref></sup> the libations and [the kindling of] the lamps [in the candelabrum], were done in the golden garments following the fifth immersion.<sup><xref rid="fn1314">130</xref></sup> The reason for this [delaying of the removal of the spoon and censer until after the slaughtering of the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon] is because it [the removal of the spoon and censer] is not in itself a rite of Service, therefore they delayed it until all the acts of the day were done, as long as the five [required] immersions<sup><xref rid="fn1314">130</xref></sup> were fulfilled. Therefore they interrupted the regular order of rites in the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon, and [the High Priest] took out the spoon and censer [from the Holy of Holies] between the slaughtering of the burnt-offering and the burning of the incense.</p>
<p>27. AND THE BULLOCK OF THE SIN-OFFERING, AND THE GOAT OF THE SIN-OFFERING &#x2026; HE SHALL CARRY FORTH WITHOUT THE CAMP. In the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, <italic>&#x2018;he&#x2019; shall carry forth</italic> means Aaron, who has been mentioned in this section, [and he is to do it] by commanding others [to carry them forth without the camp]. The correct interpretation is that it means: <italic>yotzi hamotzi</italic> (&#x201C;whoever shall carry them forth, shall carry them forth&#x201D; without the camp).<sup><xref rid="fn1315">131</xref></sup> Similarly, the expression <italic>and they shall burn</italic> [in the verse before us] means, &#x201C;and they that burn them, shall burn them.&#x201D; Scripture states it in the plural, <italic>and &#x2018;they&#x2019; shall burn</italic>, in order to teach us that if many people were engaged in the burning thereof &#x2014; such as if one brought the fire, another arranged the wood of the pile, and another kindled the fire &#x2014; only the garments of him who kindled the fire in the bullocks themselves<sup><xref rid="fn1316">132</xref></sup> are rendered impure, as soon as the fire takes hold of the greater part of it. That is why Scripture goes back and states it in the singular, <italic>and he that burneth them shall wash his clothes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1317">133</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. &#x2018;TE&#x2019;ANU&#x2019; (YE SHALL AFFLICT) YOUR SOULS. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has already explained &#x2014; in order to silence the words of the Karaites,<sup><xref rid="fn1318">134</xref></sup> may their name be blotted out<sup><xref rid="fn1319">135</xref></sup> &#x2014; that all expressions of <italic>inuy</italic> (affliction) found in Scripture together with the word &#x201C;soul,&#x201D; mean fasting.</p>
<p>32. AND THE PRIEST WHO SHALL BE ANOINTED AND WHO SHALL BE CONSECRATED TO BE PRIEST IN HIS FATHER&#x2019;S STEAD. &#x201C;I might think that only [the High Priest] who has been anointed with the oil of anointment [may perform the Service on the Day of Atonement]. Whence do I know that a High Priest who is [inducted into office only] by many garments [i.e., the eight garments which distinguish him from all ordinary priests who wear only four garments, that he too may perform the Service on that day]? Scripture therefore says, <italic>and who shall be consecrated</italic>, by attiring the [eight] garments. Such were all the High Priests who functioned after the days of King Josiah [until the destruction of the Second Temple], for in his days the flask of anointing oil was hidden.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1320">136</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Now the Rabbi did not intend to say that it was only from the days of King Josiah that there were High Priests who were [inducted into office only by means of] many garments, for in the Gemara we find that the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1321">137</xref></sup> &#x201C;Who has precedence over whom [in being redeemed from captivity, etc.], a High Priest anointed with the oil of anointment, or one who was [inducted into office only] by his attiring himself in the many garments?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1322">138</xref></sup> Again the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1323">139</xref></sup> &#x201C;Does he [that killed a person unwittingly] return from the city of refuge [only] at the death of all of them [i.e., the High Priest anointed with the oil of anointment, and the one that was inducted into office only by his attiring himself in the many garments and one that had passed from his High-priesthood], or does he return at the death of one of them?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1324">140</xref></sup> [Thus it is clear] that they can all be found at one time. Rather, [Rashi&#x2019;s intent was that] if at any time [i.e., even when High Priests were still anointed with the oil of anointment], a priest was inducted [into the High-priesthood] by the many garments [worn by the High Priest], he was eligible to perform the Service of the Day of Atonement. For another priest was always prepared [in the High Priest&#x2019;s stead] for the Day of Atonement,<sup><xref rid="fn1325">141</xref></sup> and he was not anointed.<sup><xref rid="fn1326">142</xref></sup> Thus if some disqualification occurred to the High Priest [such as by becoming impure etc.], this priest served in his stead, as he was eligible to do so through his induction [to his position] by his attiring himself in the many garments, even if he was not anointed.</p>
<p>34. AND HE DID AS THE ETERNAL COMMANDED MOSES. This means that Aaron fulfilled all that he was commanded, and he was careful all his life not to enter the Holy of Holies except on the Day of Atonement in order to bring his offerings, according to all that G-d commanded Moses.</p>
<h1>17</h1>
<p>2. SPEAK UNTO AARON, AND UNTO HIS SONS, AND UNTO ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.<sup><xref rid="fn1327">143</xref></sup> Since this section contains the warning that all offerings are to be brought only in the Tent of Meeting [i.e., in the Sanctuary Court], He therefore admonishes the priests who perform the rites of the offerings that they are not to perform the rites outside [the Sanctuary Court], and He also admonishes the Israelites that they should bring them there to G-d, and not offer them outside by themselves.</p>
<p>The correct interpretation of this section is as our Rabbis have mentioned,<sup><xref rid="fn1328">144</xref></sup> that He forbade Israel whilst in the desert to eat an ordinary meal of meat<sup><xref rid="fn1329">145</xref></sup> [i.e., one which was not part of an offering], and they were to eat only the meat of peace-offerings [the fat portions and the blood of which] had been offered upon the altar of G-d. Therefore He said that whoever wants to slaughter any of the three kinds of animals from which all offerings are brought, namely, the ox, lamb, and goat, must bring them <italic>unto the door of the Tent of Meeting</italic>, and make them <italic>offerings of peace-offerings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1330">146</xref></sup> bringing the fats and the blood upon the altar of G-d, and then he may eat the meat thereof according to the law [of peace-offerings, which is that the priest is given the breast and the right thigh, and the rest of the meat is eaten by the owner and his family for two days and the intervening night]. He further stated that if he slaughtered them in any other place, he is liable to the punishment of excision.<sup><xref rid="fn1331">147</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears likely from the language of Scripture that at first [i.e., in Verse 3-7] He declared a person liable to the punishment of excision in the case of any slaughtering outside [the Sanctuary Court] even of unconsecrated animals, this being the prohibition against eating an ordinary meal of meat,<sup><xref rid="fn1329">145</xref></sup> and He stated that the reason for it is so that they should consecrate them to G-d <italic>and the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1332">148</xref></sup> and burn on it the fat. Afterwards [in Verses 8-9] He warned against making an altar to G-d outside [the Sanctuary Court] and offering on it the peace-offerings mentioned [in Verse 5] or a burnt-offering, as used to be done with holy offerings at the time when the <italic>bamoth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1333">149</xref></sup> were permitted, but they were to offer them to G-d in front of <italic>the door of the Tent of Meeting</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1334">150</xref></sup> Thus He ordered all slaughterings, whether of unconsecrated<sup><xref rid="fn1335">151</xref></sup> or consecrated animals, to be done only within [the Sanctuary Court]. Therefore He said in the Book of Deuteronomy, <italic>But when ye go over the Jordan, and dwell in the Land</italic> etc., <italic>then it shall come to pass that the place which the Eternal your G-d shall choose to cause His Name to dwell there, thither ye shall bring &#x2026; your burnt-offerings, and your peace-offerings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1336">152</xref></sup> stating further, <italic>Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest; but in the place which the Eternal shall choose</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1337">153</xref></sup> This was to state that the prohibition against slaughtering consecrated animals outside [the Sanctuary Court] remains in force as long as the Chosen House of G-d exists,<sup><xref rid="fn1338">154</xref></sup> but He permitted slaughtering of ordinary [unconsecrated] animals [at all places]. It is this which He states, <italic>However thou mayest slaughter and eat flesh in all thy gates</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1339">155</xref></sup> meaning to say that this prohibition stated here &#x2014; not to slaughter unconsecrated animals at all, but rather to bring them all as peace-offerings upon the altar of G-d &#x2014; will not apply in the Land. And He explained there the reason: <italic>When the Eternal thy G-d shall enlarge thy border</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn1340">156</xref></sup> meaning to say that the prohibition was only in the beginning when they were in the desert, so that it was easier for them to bring all their offerings to the door of the Tent of Meeting, but after He will enlarge their border [and they will inhabit a wide area], they may eat an ordinary meal of meat<sup><xref rid="fn1329">145</xref></sup> by slaughtering [the animal] in their city, except for consecrated animals [which they must slaughter only in the Sanctuary Court]. This is the reason why He mentions here [in Verse 3], <italic>What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that slaughtereth &#x2026; within the camp or that slaughtereth out of the camp</italic>. Thus He mentions also those who slaughter <italic>out of the camp</italic>, so that they [too] should be obliged to bring them to the door of the Tent of Meeting; for although an ordinary meal of meat will be permissible when G-d will enlarge their borders, because they are not near the place of the Sanctuary, He does not likewise permit it in the desert, even outside the camp, because they are not far from the altar of G-d as they will be in the Land when G-d will enlarge their borders, at which time He permitted them an ordinary meal of meat.<sup><xref rid="fn1329">145</xref></sup></p>
<p>This is the proper interpretation of these verses, and it corresponds to the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael<sup><xref rid="fn1328">144</xref></sup> on these sections of the Torah. From this section here originates [what Rabbi Yishmael] said, that &#x201C;at first [i.e., as long as Israel was in the desert] they were forbidden to have an ordinary meal of meat.&#x201D; This is the fitting interpretation of the verse by way of the plain meaning of Scripture. It [also] coincides with the saying of the Rabbis in the Agadah:<sup><xref rid="fn1341">157</xref></sup> &#x201C;The Rabbis say: There are many things which the Holy One, blessed be He, prohibited, and in another place permitted them again.<sup><xref rid="fn1342">158</xref></sup> You may know this [from the following instance]. The Holy One, blessed be He, forbade Israel to slaughter and eat an animal unless they brought it to the door of the Sanctuary [and slaughtered it as a peace-offering]. Whence do I know this? Because it is written, <italic>and he hath not brought it into the door of the Tent of Meeting</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1343">159</xref></sup> What is written there? <italic>Blood shall be imputed unto that man</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1343">159</xref></sup> And here [in the Book of Deuteronomy] He again permitted it to them, as it is said, <italic>thou mayest eat flesh, after all the desire of thy soul</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1340">156</xref></sup> Whence do I know [that this applies to the time after their entry into the Land]? From that which is stated there on this subject, <italic>When the Eternal thy G-d shall enlarge thy border</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1340">156</xref></sup> As for that which Rashi has commented [here in Verse 3 on the expression, <italic>what man soever there be that slaughtereth an ox, or lamb</italic> etc.] that &#x201C;Scripture is speaking of consecrated animals etc.&#x201D; [while we have explained above that Verses 3-6 refer to ordinary animals, the answer is that Rashi here follows] the opinion of that Sage<sup><xref rid="fn1344">160</xref></sup> who says that an ordinary meal of meat<sup><xref rid="fn1329">145</xref></sup> was never prohibited at all [even when Israel was in the desert]. It is in accordance with that opinion that the Beraitha was taught in the Torath Kohanim,<sup><xref rid="fn1345">161</xref></sup> but the explanation of the verses in a manner that accords with them, and the approach of the words of the Sages in the traditions,<sup><xref rid="fn1346">162</xref></sup> as well as in most places,<sup><xref rid="fn1347">163</xref></sup> is as we have explained.</p>
<p>4. BLOOD SHALL BE IMPUTED UNTO THAT MAN. This means that [his guilt is as] of the time of Creation.<sup><xref rid="fn1348">164</xref></sup> The verse is thus stating: &#x201C;Now of all living creatures except man, I [the Eternal] have declared their blood to be as water, <italic>and their flesh as dung</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1349">165</xref></sup> just as it is said [at the time of Noah], <italic>as the green herb I have given you all</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1350">166</xref></sup> But if one slaughters an animal outside the camp, then [since it is forbidden to be eaten], it shall be imputed to him as if he had shed blood [of a fellow man].&#x201D;</p>
<p>7. AND THEY SHALL NO MORE SACRIFICE THEIR SACRIFICES &#x2018;LA&#x2019;SE&#x2019;IRIM&#x2019; AFTER WHOM THEY GO ASTRAY. &#x201C;<italic>La&#x2019;se&#x2019;irim</italic> means &#x2018;unto the demons.&#x2019; Similarly it states, <italic>&#x2018;u&#x2019;se&#x2019;irim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and demons</italic>) <italic>shall dance there</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1351">167</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, derived from the Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn1352">168</xref></sup> Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that &#x201C;the demons are so called [<italic>se&#x2019;irim</italic>, a word which is connected with <italic>sei&#x2019;ar</italic>, meaning &#x2018;hair&#x2019;], because on seeing them a person&#x2019;s hair stands up on his body. But it is likely that they are called <italic>se&#x2019;irim</italic> [a word which also means &#x2018;goats&#x2019;], because mentally deranged persons see them in the form of goats. And the word &#x2018;more&#x2019; [in the verse before us, <italic>and they shall no &#x2018;more&#x2019; sacrifice</italic> &#x2026;] indicates that the Israelites used to do so in Egypt. <italic>After whom they go astray</italic> denotes that whoever seeks after them and believes in them &#x2018;goes astray&#x2019; from his G-d, since he thinks that there is a power that can cause good or evil apart from the Glorious and Fearful Name.&#x201D; [Thus far the words of Ibn Ezra.]</p>
<p>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has indeed hinted at the truth concerning the word &#x201C;more,&#x201D; as I have written above.<sup><xref rid="fn1353">169</xref></sup> The name <italic>se&#x2019;irim</italic> will also be made clear to you there. They are also called <italic>sheidim</italic> [&#x201C;demons,&#x201D; as Rashi interpreted here &#x2014; a word which is connected with <italic>shodad</italic>, meaning &#x201C;devastate, despoil, ruin&#x201D;], because they dwell in &#x201C;devastated&#x201D; places, such as the desert, and their principal habitat is in the far corners [of the earth], such as the northern extremity of the earth which is wasteland on account of the cold climate.</p>
<p>Know that just as the formation at the original Creation of man&#x2019;s body as well as that of all living creatures, vegetation and minerals, was from the four elements,<sup><xref rid="fn1354">170</xref></sup> which were combined by Divine power to form material bodies which as a result of their thickness and coarseness could be perceived by the five senses,<sup><xref rid="fn1355">171</xref></sup> even so there was a creation from only two elements, fire and air, resulting in a body which cannot be felt, nor perceived by any of the [five] senses, just as the soul of an animal cannot be perceived by human senses because of its delicacy. The body [of these creatures of two elements] is of a spiritual nature; on account of its delicacy and lightness it can fly through fire and air. And just as the combination of the four elements in any object is the cause of its existence and its destruction [since everything that is composite must ultimately revert to its original components],<sup><xref rid="fn1356">172</xref></sup> so is it with these beings created from a combination of only two elements; when the elements combine, the creature lives, and when they separate [decompose], it is like the dead. It is for this reason that our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1357">173</xref></sup> &#x201C;Six characteristics have been said of <italic>sheidim</italic>, in three they are comparable to the ministering angels and in three to human beings. The three things in which they are comparable to the ministering angels are that they have wings, they fly, and they know what is about to happen, as do the ministering angels. [On this statement the Gemara asked: ] &#x2018;How can it enter your mind to say that the <italic>sheidim</italic> know the future [when even the ministering angels do not know it]&#x0021; Say rather thus: They hear [from behind <italic>the Curtain of heaven</italic>] what is about to happen.&#x2019; The three things in which they are comparable to human beings are that they eat and drink, procreate, and die as do human beings.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1358">174</xref></sup> Now the cause of death generally is the separation [decomposition] of the components of the body, this being true of all kinds of bodies [whether they are composed of the four elements like humans or of only two, like <italic>sheidim</italic>]. The reason for their ability to fly is because of the lightness of the [two] elements [fire and air] of which they are composed, as may also be seen in the case of a fowl, in which, because the elements of fire and air dominate over the small parts of the other two elements [earth and water], the fowl can hover in the air and fly [although it is composed of all four elements]. Surely, then, the above-mentioned creatures that have nothing in them of the heavy elements [earth and water], possess great hovering power in the air, to be able to fly tirelessly. The matter of &#x201C;eating&#x201D; [mentioned above in connection with these creatures] means their deriving nourishment from the moisture of water and the odors of fire, something like the fire that <italic>licked up the water that was in the trench</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1359">175</xref></sup> This is the purpose of the burnings which necromancers perform to the demons. The reason [for their need to &#x201C;eat&#x201D;] is that the fire in the air causes the drying up of their bodies, which must therefore be restored just as man&#x2019;s need for food is due to depletion in his body. As for that which has been said concerning their &#x201C;hearing what is about to happen,&#x201D; it is because in the course of their flying on high they become aware of things that are about to happen from the powerful forces contained in the atmosphere, these being &#x201C;the princes of the quiver.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1360">176</xref></sup> It is also from there that &#x201C;those who have wings tell matters&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1361">177</xref></sup> of the future, as has been tested by enchanters,<sup><xref rid="fn1362">178</xref></sup> and as I will explain in its place<sup><xref rid="fn1363">179</xref></sup> with the help of G-d. But neither of them know what is to happen <italic>for many days to come and for times that are far off;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1364">180</xref></sup> but they can only inform of that which is to happen in the near future, as we know from their encounters [i.e., those of enchanters], that they gain knowledge from the <italic>sheidim</italic> as to what has been decreed to come. Therefore Onkelos rendered the verse, <italic>They sacrificed unto demons, &#x2018;lo eloha&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>no gods</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1365">181</xref></sup> as &#x201C;they sacrificed unto demons in which there is no utility,&#x201D; meaning that there is no need for them, as they do not prevent harm that is destined to come, neither do they do anything productive, nor do they inform of times far off so that a person may knowingly guard himself. It is this which is the sense of the expression, <italic>lo eloha</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1365">181</xref></sup> which is as if it said, &#x201C;no power or rulership,&#x201D; for the word <italic>Elokim</italic> is an expression of strength and power, [a composite word consisting of the words] <italic>e-il heim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1366">182</xref></sup> Thus the verse is stating that demons have no strength or power whatsoever, and hence there is no need for them, <italic>for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1367">183</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. FOR THE LIFE OF THE FLESH IS IN THE BLOOD; AND I HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU UPON THE ALTAR TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR YOUR SOULS. The sense of this verse is to state that He forbade us [to eat] blood because He has given it to us to be upon the altar and to effect atonement for our souls, and it is therefore the part dedicated to G-d, just as is the case with the forbidden fat.<sup><xref rid="fn1368">184</xref></sup> And if one should ask: &#x201C;Why then has He forbidden us to eat the blood of a wild animal and that of a fowl, from which offerings are not brought?&#x201D; We will dismiss the questioner by saying that it was His wish to keep us far away from eating any kind of blood, in order that we should never make a mistake therein [and eat forbidden blood as a result of failing to distinguish between one kind of blood and another]. In the case of fat, however, He did not [categorically] forbid all kinds of fat, because [the permissible kind of fat] is distinguishable from the non-permissible.<sup><xref rid="fn1369">185</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup><xref rid="fn1370">186</xref></sup> that the Chaldeans loathed blood, considering it impure, and only those who sought to establish contact with the demons and to foretell the future would eat it. Now the Torah always seeks to destroy these foolish theories, by [ordaining measures which are] contrary to their ideas. Therefore He prohibited the eating of blood and chose it as the means of purifying [the impure] by means of the sprinklings thereof,<sup><xref rid="fn1371">187</xref></sup> and to throw it upon the altar of G-d for atonement. Therefore He said, <italic>I will set My face against that soul that eateth blood</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1372">188</xref></sup> just as He said with reference to him who gives of his children to Molech,<sup><xref rid="fn1373">189</xref></sup> because this [practice of eating blood] leads to a kind of idol worship, such words not being stated concerning any other commandment. Now these words [of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon] are sensible in themselves, however the verses do not indicate [that the reason for the prohibition against eating blood is] so [as the Rabbi has said], for they always state the reason for that prohibition to be, <italic>For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1374">190</xref></sup> <italic>For the life of the flesh is in the blood</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1375">191</xref></sup> And in the Book of Deuteronomy He again states, <italic>Only be steadfast in not eating the blood; for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1376">192</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is proper, therefore, to explain the reason for the prohibition against eating blood by saying that G-d created all lower creatures for the purpose of man, since only he amongst all of them recognizes his Creator. Nonetheless, He did not at first permit man to eat anything except for vegetation, but no living creatures at all, just as is stated in the Chapter of Creation where it is said, <italic>Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed</italic> etc. <italic>for food</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn1377">193</xref></sup> but when the flood came and they [the lower creatures] were saved by the merit of Noah, and he brought offerings from them to G-d which were acceptable before Him,<sup><xref rid="fn1378">194</xref></sup> He gave man permission to slaughter [and eat them], just as He said, <italic>Every moving thing that liveth shall be for food for you; as the green herb have I given you all</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1379">195</xref></sup> since their existence was because of man. Thus He permitted man to use their bodies for his benefit and needs because their life was on account of man&#x2019;s sake, and that their soul [i.e., blood] should be used for man&#x2019;s atonement when offering them up before Him, blessed be He, but not to eat it, since one creature possessed of a soul is not to eat another creature with a soul, for all souls belong to G-d. The life of man just as the life of the animal are all His, <italic>even one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1380">196</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now in the opinion of the Greek philosopher [i.e., Aristotle] as interpreted by those who scrutinize his words, it was out of the Active Intellect<sup><xref rid="fn1381">197</xref></sup> that there emitted a very fine and bright flash and glitter of light, from which came forth the spark which is the soul of the animal. It is thus in a certain sense a real soul. It therefore has sufficient understanding to avoid harm, and to seek its welfare, and a sense of recognition towards those with whom it is familiar, and love towards them, just as dogs love their masters, and they have a wonderful sense of recognition of the people of their households, and similarly pigeons have a sense of knowledge and recognition. Now it is also known that the food one eats is taken into the body of the eater <italic>and they become one flesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1382">198</xref></sup> If one were to eat <italic>the life of all flesh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1374">190</xref></sup> it would then attach itself to one&#x2019;s own blood and they would become united in one&#x2019;s heart, and the result would be a thickening and coarsensss of the human soul so that it would closely approach the nature of the animal soul which resided in that which he ate, since blood does not require digestion as other foods do, which thereby become changed, and thus man&#x2019;s soul will become combined with the blood of the animal&#x0021; And Scripture states, <italic>Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1383">199</xref></sup> It is for this reason that He said, <italic>For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the flesh thereof</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1374">190</xref></sup> for all flesh, whether man or beast, has its soul in the blood, and it is not fitting to mix the soul that is destined to destruction with that which is to live [in the hereafter]. Rather, it is to be as an atonement upon the altar to be acceptable before G-d. This is the sense of the expression, <italic>Therefore I said to the children of Israel: No soul of you shall eat blood</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1384">200</xref></sup> meaning: &#x201C;Because the blood is identical with the soul, and it is not proper that one soul devour another, therefore I had compassion upon man&#x2019;s life and gave it [the animal&#x2019;s soul] to him upon the altar, so that the soul of the animal should effect atonement for his soul.&#x201D; Thus we have been taught in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn1385">201</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Only be steadfast in not eating the blood</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1376">192</xref></sup> Rabbi Yehudah says, [From the fact that it states, <italic>only be steadfast</italic>, which indicates that a special effort was required], you learn that they were addicted to eating blood etc. <italic>For the blood is the life</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1376">192</xref></sup> &#x2014; this teaches you why it was prohibited. <italic>And thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1376">192</xref></sup> &#x2014; this prohibits the eating of a limb cut from a living animal.&#x201D; This is a hint and proof for what we have explained. It is for this reason that He further commanded that we are to cover up all blood of an [edible] wild beast or fowl [which have been ritually slaughtered]<sup><xref rid="fn1386">202</xref></sup> because their blood is not brought upon the altar, for even of fowls only two species [i.e., young pigeons and turtle doves] may be brought as offerings, and they too are not slaughtered [in the usual way];<sup><xref rid="fn1387">203</xref></sup> but in the case of cattle, most of them that are found among men may be slaughtered to the Glorious Name and their blood is used for atonement, and it is therefore not to be covered. There was no necessity to require the covering of the blood of an ordinary [unconsecrated] animal, since the slaughtering of cattle for ordinary meat was not permitted in the desert,<sup><xref rid="fn1388">204</xref></sup> and even afterwards [when Israel came into the Land of Israel and a meal of ordinary meat was permitted], the commandment of the Torah is directed to the majority [and since in most cases cattle were brought as offerings, and their blood would be needed for the altar, therefore He did not require covering of the blood even if the cattle were not slaughtered as offerings].</p>
<p>14. THE BLOOD THEREOF IS &#x2018;B&#x2019;NAFSHO&#x2019; (ALL ONE WITH THE LIFE THEREOF). &#x201C;Its blood represents its life, since life is dependent upon the blood.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But it is not correct.<sup><xref rid="fn1389">205</xref></sup> Rather, it is possible to explain that the word <italic>b&#x2019;nafsho</italic> here means &#x201C;in its body,&#x201D; Scripture thus stating, &#x201C;<italic>for as to the life of all flesh</italic>, it is the blood in its body.&#x201D; Similarly [we find the word <italic>nefesh</italic> meaning &#x201C;body&#x201D; in these verses]: <italic>&#x2018;Nafsho&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>his person</italic>) <italic>was laid in iron;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1390">206</xref></sup> <italic>seventy &#x2018;nefesh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>persons</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn1391">207</xref></sup> <italic>he</italic> [the Nazirite] <italic>shall not come near to a dead &#x2018;nefesh,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1392">208</xref></sup> meaning &#x201C;a body,&#x201D; since &#x201C;the body&#x201D; of anyone that is possessed of a <italic>nefesh</italic> (soul) is also called <italic>nefesh</italic>.</p>
<p>In my opinion Scripture mentioned three expressions with reference to blood, which constitute but one reason. First it stated, <italic>For the life of the flesh is in the blood</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1393">209</xref></sup> Then it changed and said [in Verse 14 before us], <italic>For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof</italic>, meaning to say that the blood is the life, and the life is in the blood, as both are mixed together, similarly to wine when diluted with water, in which case the water is in the wine and the wine in the water, and each one is &#x201C;in&#x201D; the other. Afterwards it explained [in the second half of Verse 14 before us, stating <italic>for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof</italic>], that the blood is the very life, meaning to say that both have become one inseparable substance, so that you can never find blood without life nor life without blood, as is known of the air<sup><xref rid="fn1394">210</xref></sup> which originates in the heart, that it is the <italic>hyly</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1395">211</xref></sup> from which proceed all dispositions [of man], supplying the substance which gives nutrition and makes blood, and it is the blood which in turn creates it and sustains it. [The relationship between life and blood is thus] like that of matter and form in all physical creatures, where the one cannot be found without the other. Now our Rabbis interpreted the three punishments of excision which Scripture mentioned with reference to blood<sup><xref rid="fn1396">212</xref></sup> in the following way:<sup><xref rid="fn1397">213</xref></sup> &#x201C;One verse prohibits the eating of that blood with which life escapes [when cutting the throat of the offering, since it has been given for atonement upon the altar]; one verse prohibits the eating of blood which escapes when slaughtering [an ordinary, unconsecrated animal], and one verse prohibits the eating of blood, that [of a fowl or wild animal, which when slaughtered] must be covered.&#x201D; This saying of the Rabbis explains why the punishment of excision was mentioned three times, but the reason for the different Scriptural expressions concerning the life and the blood [of the animal] is as I have explained.</p>
<h1>18</h1>
<p>2. SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. Since this chapter deals with [the laws of] prohibited sexual intercourse which apply equally to all Israel, therefore He said only, <italic>Speak unto the children of Israel</italic>, and did not specify the priests but included them together. Therefore He said at first, <italic>I am the Eternal your G-d</italic>, just as He did in the Ten Commandments [which He began with the words, <italic>I am the Eternal thy G-d</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1398">214</xref></sup> And the meaning of the verse, <italic>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: I am the Eternal your G-d</italic>, is as if He said, &#x201C;Say unto them in My Name, &#x2018;I am the Eternal your G-d.&#x2019;&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them: Ye shall be holy, for I the Eternal your G-d am holy</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1399">215</xref></sup> [means: &#x201C;say unto them in My Name, &#x2018;Ye shall be holy&#x2019;&#x201D;].</p>
<p>It is possible that the reason [why the verse does not say: &#x201C;this is what G-d commanded,&#x201D; is not because it means: &#x201C;say unto them in My Name&#x201D; as explained above, but] is rather as follows: When Moses came out from before the Eternal without the veil<sup><xref rid="fn1400">216</xref></sup> [on his face], <italic>and he came out, and spoke unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1401">217</xref></sup> he did not need to say to them: &#x201C;Thus said the Eternal,&#x201D; for it was known to them that it was His spirit that spoke through him [Moses] and His word was upon his tongue,<sup><xref rid="fn1402">218</xref></sup> and that he did not speak in his own name. Similarly, in many places in the Book of Deuteronomy it is stated in the same way, such as: <italic>And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto My commandments, which I command you this day &#x2026; that I will give the rain of your Land &#x2026; And I will give grass in thy fields</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1403">219</xref></sup> and [it is known that] Moses is not the one <italic>who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1404">220</xref></sup> and makes the grass grow in the fields, but it is G-d, blessed be He [that does these things]. Similarly it is said, <italic>But the Eternal hath not given you a heart to know &#x2026; And I have led you forty years in the desert &#x2026; Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink; that ye might know that I am the Eternal your G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1405">221</xref></sup> The meaning of the expression <italic>to love the Eternal your G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1406">222</xref></sup> [which is stated in the third person, when that same verse begins in the first person, <italic>And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto My commandments</italic>], has already been explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1407">223</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, the Scriptural command, <italic>After the doings of the land of Egypt &#x2026; shall ye not do</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1408">224</xref></sup> is a reference to [the practice of sacrificing to] the demons mentioned above [in 17:7]; <italic>and after the doings of the land of Canaan &#x2026; shall ye not do</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1408">224</xref></sup> is an allusion to the forbidden sexual relationships, in which the Canaanites <italic>were very bad and sinful</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1409">225</xref></sup> as He stated at the end of this section, <italic>For all these abominations have the men of the Land done</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1410">226</xref></sup> And in the opinion of our Rabbis in the Torath Kohanim,<sup><xref rid="fn1411">227</xref></sup> the Egyptians were also addicted to carnality, in all forms of the forbidden relationships, and with males and cattle. This is the truth, [as Scripture states] that <italic>there were also sodomites in the Land</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1412">228</xref></sup> referring [to <italic>the abominations of the nations</italic>] which were there from the beginning till now. Scripture further testifies concerning them, <italic>the Egyptians, thy neighbors, great of flesh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1413">229</xref></sup> and it further says, <italic>whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1414">230</xref></sup> the term &#x201C;flesh&#x201D; being a euphemism [for the sexual organ]. Similarly, in the expressions, <italic>his flesh ran with his issue</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1415">231</xref></sup> <italic>and her issue in her flesh be blood</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1416">232</xref></sup> [the term &#x201C;flesh&#x201D; is an allusion to the sexual organ].</p>
<p>4. MINE ORDINANCES SHALL YE DO. &#x201C;These are matters prescribed in the Torah which, even if they were not prescribed, one would know that they ought to be prescribed.&#x201D; Thus the language of Rashi. And in the Torath Kohanim it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn1417">233</xref></sup> &#x201C;These are matters written in the Torah which, even if they were not written, would deserve to have been written, such as robberies, forbidden sexual relationships, idolatry, bloodshed and blasphemy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now by way of the simple meaning of Scripture, the term <italic>mishpatai</italic> (Mine ordinances) is to be understood in its simple sense. It is a reference to the laws stated in the section of <italic>V&#x2019;eileh Hamishpatim</italic> (<italic>And these are the ordinances</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1418">234</xref></sup> and in the whole Torah. Therefore He states here, <italic>which if a man do, he shall live by them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1419">235</xref></sup> as these laws were given so that man should live, and for the development of countries, and peace among men, so that no one should cause harm to his fellowman or kill him. The prophet Ezekiel likewise mentioned many times with reference to these <italic>mishpatim</italic> (ordinances), <italic>which if a man do, he shall live by them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1420">236</xref></sup> while of the Sabbath he says, <italic>to be a sign between Me and them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1421">237</xref></sup> Similarly in the Book of Nehemiah it says, <italic>Thine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1422">238</xref></sup> But our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1423">239</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>He shall live by them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1419">235</xref></sup> &#x2014; but not die by them. This teaches that danger to live overrides the Sabbath laws and [all] the commandments.&#x201D; And according to the Midrashic interpretation it means:<sup><xref rid="fn1424">240</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>He shall live by them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1419">235</xref></sup> &#x2014; in the World to Come. Should you say it means that he shall live in this world, will he not in the end die&#x0021;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1425">241</xref></sup> And if so, the expression <italic>which if a man do, he shall live by them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1419">235</xref></sup> refers back [not only to the <italic>mishpatim</italic> (ordinances), as we explained before, but] also to <italic>chukothai</italic> [&#x201C;My statutes,&#x201D; those laws for which no reason is given, but the observance of which also assures one <italic>eternal</italic> life].</p>
<p>Know that man&#x2019;s [reward in] life for the observance of the commandments is in accordance with his preparation for them. For he who fulfills the commandments not for their own sake, but in order to receive a reward, will be rewarded on account of them in this world with longevity, riches, possessions, and honor. It is concerning this [kind of observance of the laws of the Torah] that it is said, <italic>in her left hand are riches and honor</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1426">242</xref></sup> which the Rabbis interpreted to mean:<sup><xref rid="fn1427">243</xref></sup> &#x201C;to those that stand on the left of it [i.e., to those who engage in the observance of the Torah not for its own sake], there are material riches and honor.&#x201D; Similarly, those who engage in the observance of the commandments so as to merit by them reward in the World to Come, these being the people who serve G-d out of fear [of punishment], will be found worthy on account of their intention to be saved from the judgments that will come upon the wicked, and their souls shall abide in joyfulness<sup><xref rid="fn1428">244</xref></sup> [in life eternal]. But those who engage in the observance of the commandments out of love, as is right and proper, together with worldly occupation, similar to what is mentioned in the Torah in the section of <italic>Im Bechukothai</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1429">245</xref></sup> <italic>And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1430">246</xref></sup> they will merit good life in this world according to the usual nature of things, and in life eternal, in the World to Come, their merits will still be complete before them [since the reward they received in their lifetime will not reduce that which is to come to them in the hereafter]. But those who abandon altogether the concerns of this world and pay no attention to it, acting as if they themselves were not creatures of physical being, and all their thoughts and intentions are directed only to their Creator, just as was the case with Elijah, [these people] on account of their soul cleaving to the Glorious Name will live forever in body and soul, as is evidenced in Scripture concerning Elijah<sup><xref rid="fn1431">247</xref></sup> and as is known of him in tradition,<sup><xref rid="fn1432">248</xref></sup> and as the Midrashim speak of Enoch<sup><xref rid="fn1433">249</xref></sup> and of those belonging to the World to Come who will rise at the resurrection. It is for this reason that on the subject of reward for observance of the commandments the verses speak [in various ways, such as]: <italic>that thy days may be long;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1434">250</xref></sup> <italic>that thou mayest live;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1435">251</xref></sup> <italic>and that thou mayest prolong thy days</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1436">252</xref></sup> For these expressions include all kinds of life, each according to his due.</p>
<p>6. NONE OF YOU SHALL APPROACH TO ANY THAT IS NEAR OF KIN TO HIM, TO UNCOVER THEIR NAKEDNESS. The reason for the prohibition of sexual relationships with one&#x2019;s near of kin is not expressly written [in the Torah]. The Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup><xref rid="fn1437">253</xref></sup> that [this law seeks to inculcate the lessons that] we should limit sexual intercourse, hold it in contempt, and perform it rarely. Now these women which Scripture has forbidden amongst the relatives of one&#x2019;s wife are forbidden because they are constantly together with him in his house,<sup><xref rid="fn1438">254</xref></sup> and the same applies to one&#x2019;s own relatives [sisters, aunts, and the wife of one&#x2019;s uncle], who are frequently with him and he is closeted together with them. A similar reason the Rabbi states for all forbidden relations. Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has already written<sup><xref rid="fn1439">255</xref></sup> likewise that since the passion of man&#x2019;s heart is like that of the animals, it was impossible for Scripture to forbid all females, and therefore it prohibited only those that are available to him at all times. But this is a very weak reason, that Scripture should make a person liable to the punishment of excision in the case of these forbidden relations, just because they are sometimes found together with him, and at the same time permit a man to marry many women, even in the hundreds and thousands&#x0021; And what harm would there be if a man would marry only his daughter, just as was permitted to the Noachides,<sup><xref rid="fn1440">256</xref></sup> or marry two sisters as did our patriarch Jacob? A person also could not do better than to give his daughter in marriage to his elder son, and they would inherit his possessions and multiply and increase in his house, for <italic>He created not</italic> the earth <italic>a waste, He formed it to be inhabited</italic>&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1441">257</xref></sup> We have no tradition as to [the reason of] this prohibition of forbidden relationships, but logically it would appear that there is in this matter one of the secrets of creation, which attaches to the soul and is part of the secret of the transmigration [of souls], to which we have already alluded.<sup><xref rid="fn1442">258</xref></sup></p>
<p>Know that sexual intercourse is held distant and in contempt in the Torah unless it is for the preservation of the human species, and therefore where there can be no offspring [such as in pederasty or carnal intercourse with beasts], it is forbidden. Similarly, where [the union is such that] the child born therefrom will not have a healthy existence, nor succeed from it, the Torah prohibited such a union. This is the sense of the expressions: <italic>el kol &#x2018;sh&#x2019;eir&#x2019; b&#x2019;saro</italic> [literally: <italic>to any &#x2018;flesh&#x2019; next to his flesh</italic>]; <italic>for he hath made naked &#x2018;eth sh&#x2019;eiro&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1443">259</xref></sup> [literally: <italic>his flesh</italic>]. Thus the Torah forbade these marriages on account of <italic>sh&#x2019;eir</italic> [i.e., because the forbidden relations constitute &#x201C;flesh&#x201D; next to one&#x2019;s own], the term <italic>sh&#x2019;eir</italic> being derived from the expression [in the verse], <italic>&#x2018;hanish&#x2019;ar&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he that is left</italic>) <italic>in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1444">260</xref></sup> Hence Scripture states, <italic>they are &#x2018;sha&#x2019;arah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>near kinswomen</italic>); <italic>it is lewdness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1445">261</xref></sup> meaning to say, &#x201C;these are not marriages, nor fit for such a relationship, for they will not succeed [in having healthy offspring, as explained above]; rather it is lewdness, mere thoughts of indecency.&#x201D; Thus the forbidden relationships are included in &#x201C;the statutes,&#x201D; the laws which constitute &#x201C;the decrees of the King.&#x201D; Now a decree is an ordinance which originates in the knowledge of the King, Who is wise in the management of His kingdom, and it is He Who knows the need for and the benefit of the command that He ordained, and He does not tell it to anyone except to His wise counsellors.</p>
<p>7. THE NAKEDNESS OF THY FATHER, AND THE NAKEDNESS OF THY MOTHER, SHALT THOU NOT UNCOVER. Rashi commented: &#x201C;<italic>The nakedness of thy father</italic> &#x2014; this refers to thy father&#x2019;s wife. <italic>And the nakedness of thy mother</italic> &#x2014; this is intended to include one&#x2019;s own mother, although she be not the wife of one&#x2019;s father. <italic>The nakedness of thy father&#x2019;s wife shalt thou not uncover</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1446">262</xref></sup> &#x2014; this is intended to include in this prohibition one&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s wife even after [the father&#x2019;s] death.&#x201D; Similarly Rashi explained: &#x201C;<italic>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father&#x2019;s brother</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1447">263</xref></sup> And what does this [uncovering of his] nakedness mean? <italic>Thou shalt not approach to his wife</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1447">263</xref></sup> This is indeed true according to the correct sense [of the verses]. But in the Gemara of Tractate Sanhedrin<sup><xref rid="fn1448">264</xref></sup> the Rabbis concluded that the verses, <italic>the nakedness of thy father</italic>, and <italic>the nakedness of thy father&#x2019;s brother</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1447">263</xref></sup> are prohibitions against carnal relationships with these males themselves [and not with their wives], and [are required] to make the offender liable to a double penalty if he committed it in error [lying carnally with his father or uncle].<sup><xref rid="fn1449">265</xref></sup> But I wonder, according to the opinion of the Sages [who explain the verse, <italic>the nakedness of thy father</italic> as being a prohibition against lying carnally with one&#x2019;s father], why did He not likewise admonish against lying carnally with a son or brother, in addition to prohibiting [sexual relationships with their] wives?<sup><xref rid="fn1450">266</xref></sup> Perhaps the Torah was more particular in guarding the honor of the elders. However, each and every verse in this section [of forbidden relationships] constitutes only one prohibition,<sup><xref rid="fn1451">267</xref></sup> there being here no case of two admonitions in one prohibition, for the command concerning sisters [in Verse 9] and also daughters [in Verse 10] each constitute but one prohibition [and not, as Rashi explained there, that each verse contains two prohibitions]. The correct interpretation by way of the simple meaning of Scripture appears to me to be that <italic>the nakedness of thy father, and the nakedness of thy mother</italic> [<italic>shalt thou not uncover</italic>], constitute but one negative commandment and one admonition, which forbids intercourse with one&#x2019;s own mother, for in having such intercourse he thereby uncovers the nakedness of his father and that of his mother. This is the sense of the [concluding] expression in this verse, <italic>she is thy mother</italic>, meaning that you have done with her two evils, in that you have uncovered the nakedness of your mother and that of your father. Following the admonition against uncovering the nakedness of one&#x2019;s father, which refers [as explained] to one&#x2019;s mother, He went back [in the following Verse 8] and admonished against [uncovering] the nakedness of one&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s wife, although she be not one&#x2019;s mother, saying, <italic>The nakedness of thy father&#x2019;s wife shalt thou not uncover; it is thy father&#x2019;s nakedness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1452">268</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father&#x2019;s brother</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1453">269</xref></sup> means [as the verse itself continues], <italic>thou shalt not approach to his wife</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1453">269</xref></sup> This is why it does not say &#x201C;and&#x201D; to [<italic>his wife thou shalt not approach</italic>].</p>
<p>9. THE NAKEDNESS OF THY SISTER, THE DAUGHTER OF THY FATHER, OR THE DAUGHTER OF THY MOTHER, WHETHER BORN AT HOME, OR BORN ABROAD, EVEN THEIR NAKEDNESS THOU SHALT NOT UNCOVER. &#x201C;<italic>Whether born at home, or born abroad</italic> &#x2014; this means whether [the court] says to your father, &#x2018;Keep her mother as your wife,&#x2019; or whether it has to say to him, &#x2018;Divorce her mother,&#x2019; as for instance when she [i.e., the mother] is a <italic>mamzereth</italic> or a <italic>nethinah</italic>&#x201D; [a <italic>mamzereth</italic> is the female product from one of the forbidden sexual relationships in this section, and a <italic>nethinah</italic> is a female descendant of the Gibeonites &#x2014; relationships with these women being in both cases punishable by whipping]. Thus the language of Rashi. But it is not correct, since this interpretation leads to the conclusion that a sister that is born from [a woman who is herself one of] the relations forbidden [to his father],<sup><xref rid="fn1454">270</xref></sup> is not included in this prohibition [against marrying one&#x2019;s sister. For since Rashi explained the expressions <italic>whether born at home, or born abroad</italic> as referring to the <italic>mother</italic>, whether she is a lawful wife or a <italic>mamzereth</italic> or <italic>nethinah</italic>, both of whom are forbidden to the father only by punishment of whipping, and not by excision, unlike all forbidden relations, then the illogical result follows that if the mother <italic>were</italic> one of those relations forbidden to his father by punishment of excision, then the son&#x2019;s sister born from that union would not be included in this prohibition]&#x0021; And yet all [sisters] are forbidden by excision [i.e., regardless of whether the sister was born of a union itself permitted, or forbidden by whipping only, or by excision], unless she be born of a bondwoman or a Cuthean woman [in which case she is not considered his sister at all]&#x0021;</p>
<p>And I wonder at the Rabbi [Rashi]&#x0021; For in the Gemara of Tractate Yebamoth<sup><xref rid="fn1455">271</xref></sup> in the second chapter it is clearly stated: &#x201C;Perhaps I can say that this excludes a sister born of a union forbidden by whipping [as in the case where his father married a <italic>mamzereth</italic> and she gave birth to a daughter, for I might say that the marriage, being forbidden, had no validity, and she is therefore not his &#x2018;sister&#x2019; in the sense that she is included in the prohibition against having intercourse with one&#x2019;s sister]&#x0021; Said Rav Papa: In unions punishable by whipping, the marriage, [although forbidden], has legal validity. For it is written, <italic>If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1456">272</xref></sup> Now is there before G-d a beloved one and a hated one [i.e., could it be supposed that the law should allow discrimination between the children of a favored wife and those of a hated wife]? Rather, you must say &#x2018;beloved&#x2019; denotes &#x2018;beloved for her well-chosen marriage&#x2019; [i.e., that it was blameless, since it was within the law], and &#x2018;hated&#x2019; means &#x2018;hated for her [illicit] marriage.&#x2019; And the Merciful One states, <italic>&#x2018;ki thihyena l&#x2019;ish&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>if a man &#x2018;have&#x2019;</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>two wives</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1457">273</xref></sup> Perhaps I might say that this excludes a sister born of a union punishable by excision [so that she is not his &#x2018;sister&#x2019; in the sense that she is included in the prohibition against having intercourse with one&#x2019;s sister]&#x0021; Said Rava: Scripture states, <italic>The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad</italic>, which means whether [the court] can say to your father, &#x2018;Keep [the mother as your wife],&#x2019; or whether it has to say to him, <italic>&#x2018;Hotzei&#x2019;</italic> [as explained further on], and yet the Merciful One states that she is <italic>thy sister</italic>&#x0021;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1458">274</xref></sup> Now the meaning of the word <italic>hotzei</italic> is that [the court] tells him, &#x201C;Take her out from your house, for she is not your [legitimate] wife, and the act of marriage has no legal validity in those cases where the union is punishable by excision or by any of the [four] deaths by the hand of the court.&#x201D; And yet notwithstanding this, one is punished for having intercourse with her because she <italic>is</italic> considered his sister&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1459">275</xref></sup> Only one&#x2019;s sister born from a bondwoman or a Cuthean woman is not included in this prohibition, since the offspring is of her own [legal] standing.</p>
<p>By way of the plain meaning of Scripture the verse is stating: &#x201C;<italic>The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born</italic> of a marriage, as when the father brought the woman into the home as a wife [and she gave birth to a daughter], <italic>or born abroad</italic>, as when the man found her outside, <italic>and lay hold on her, and lie with her</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1460">276</xref></sup> and she gave him birth [to a daughter], <italic>thou shalt not uncover their nakedness</italic>.&#x201D; Thus He mentioned [the prohibition concerning] a mother&#x2019;s daughter whether she be born in wedlock or from unchastity. For even though in either case she is only his mother&#x2019;s daughter and not his father&#x2019;s daughter, [and if so, why did Scripture have to mention both cases], yet one might have thought that a brotherly relationship [forbidding sexual intercourse] applies only to a sister born in wedlock, but not to one born from unchastity, where everything is &#x201C;free;&#x201D; therefore Scripture had to admonish against all [kinds of sisters]. There is yet another verse which He stated with reference to one&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s daughter, stating <italic>The nakedness of thy father&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s daughter, begotten of thy father</italic> [<italic>thou shalt not uncover</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1461">277</xref></sup> this being [a prohibition against having intercourse with] a sister who is one&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s daughter born of his legitimate wife. It was necessary that He state this, because having said [in Verse 9 before us], <italic>the nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father</italic>, without any qualification, and then in connection with <italic>the daughter of thy mother</italic> He explained <italic>whether born at home</italic> through marriage, <italic>or born abroad</italic> through unchastity, one might therefore have thought that one&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s daughter born in unchastity is permissible to him; for perhaps the Torah was not particular about a man&#x2019;s offspring born in unchastity, because these are not known to him; therefore He said in explanation, <italic>The nakedness of thy father&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s daughter</italic> [<italic>thou shalt not uncover</italic>], thus declaring that the daughter of one&#x2019;s father mentioned at first [in Verse 9 before us] is not one&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s daughter born of his legitimate wife [since that is specifically mentioned further on in Verse 11]. Also, because in the case of the Noachides the prohibition [against sexual intercourse] was only if the brotherhood was from the same mother, and not [if it was exclusively] from the father, Scripture therefore explains that with respect to Israelites, all are alike in the prohibition [whether they are born of one father or one mother].</p>
<p>The correct interpretation of this verse is what the Sages have said in the Gemara of Tractate Yebamoth;<sup><xref rid="fn1462">278</xref></sup> &#x201C;A man who has intercourse with his sister, who is also the daughter of his father&#x2019;s wife [through marriage]<sup><xref rid="fn1463">279</xref></sup> who is not his mother,<sup><xref rid="fn1464">280</xref></sup> is guilty both on account of his sister, and his father&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s daughter.&#x201D; And there in the Gemara the Rabbis explained the reason: &#x201C;Observe, it is written, <italic>the nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father</italic> etc.; what need was there for the expression, <italic>the nakedness of thy father&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s daughter</italic> etc.?<sup><xref rid="fn1461">277</xref></sup> In order to teach that he is guilty both on account of his sister, and his father&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s daughter.&#x201D; Thus Scripture repeats certain prohibitions in order to make one [who commits these abominable practices] guilty on many counts, for even with reference to creeping things [which we are forbidden to eat] He has repeated many prohibitions regarding one matter, in order to punish the offender on all counts.</p>
<p>17. IT IS &#x2018;ZIMAH&#x2019; (LEWDNESS). Onkelos translated: &#x201C;it is a sinful plan,&#x201D; and Rashi commented thereon, &#x201C;because your evil inclination counsels you to sin.&#x201D; But I know of no sense to this, for with regard to all forbidden relations and all other transgressions, it is the evil inclination that counsels one to sin&#x0021; [Why then is this verse prohibiting intercourse with a woman and her daughter, singled out by the use of this expression?] But the meaning of the matter is that the term <italic>zimah</italic> is derived from the expression, <italic>as &#x2018;zamam&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he had purposed</italic>) <italic>to do unto his brother</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1465">281</xref></sup> A proper thought is called <italic>m&#x2019;zimah</italic>, as it said, <italic>And no &#x2018;m&#x2019;zimah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>purpose</italic>) <italic>can be withholden from Thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1466">282</xref></sup> and lewdness that is thought of in secret is called <italic>zimah</italic>, similar to that which it is said, <italic>If my heart have been enticed unto a woman</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1467">283</xref></sup> and Scripture concludes, <italic>For that were &#x2018;zimah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a heinous crime</italic>); <italic>yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1468">284</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;zimatheich&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thy lewdness</italic>) <italic>and thy harlotries;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1469">285</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;zimath&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the lewdness of</italic>) <italic>thy harlotry</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1470">286</xref></sup> denoting these illicit acts committed in private and in public. In my opinion Scripture states <italic>it is &#x2018;zimah&#x2019;</italic>, in the case of [sexual relationships with] a woman and her daughter, and also a woman and her mother,<sup><xref rid="fn1471">287</xref></sup> in order to condemn the matter, saying that when one lies with the one, who is his wife, he thinks of the other one on account of their relationship and likeness, and thus lying with both of them is a cause of lewdness to him. This matter is similar to that which the Rabbis have mentioned:<sup><xref rid="fn1472">288</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against Me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1473">289</xref></sup> These are the children [who are the offspring] of nine different dispositions [in their parents] etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1474">290</xref></sup> It is for this reason that Scripture states here, <italic>the nakedness of a woman and her daughter</italic> etc., and similarly it says, <italic>And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is lewdness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1471">287</xref></sup> and does not say &#x201C;the nakedness of your wife&#x2019;s daughter, or your wife&#x2019;s mother, you shalt not uncover&#x201D; [but rather mentions them in each case together, by saying: <italic>the nakedness of a woman and her mother</italic>, or <italic>the nakedness of a woman and her daughter</italic>, in order to indicate that the prohibition is on account of thinking of the two together]. And the explanation of the verses here is as follows: At the beginning of the section He said, <italic>None of you shall approach to any that is &#x2018;sh&#x2019;eir&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>near of</italic>) <italic>flesh to him, to uncover their nakedness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1475">291</xref></sup> thus prohibiting [sexual intercourse with] those who are near of flesh to him, and He stated the reason for this to be, <italic>for theirs is thine own nakedness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1476">292</xref></sup> and so now [in Verse 17 before us] where He prohibits the wife&#x2019;s relations, He states <italic>&#x2018;sha&#x2019;arah heinah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>they are near kinswomen</italic>), meaning to say that they are also forbidden because they [the women] are near of flesh to each other, and lying with both of them would be lewdness, as I have explained. Similarly Scripture states, <italic>and each hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1477">293</xref></sup> meaning that he defiled her to her husband, for even when she will be with her husband, she will think of his father because of their likeness. Now Scripture calls lying with animals <italic>tevel hu</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1478">294</xref></sup> denoting [as Rashi explained] &#x201C;the mingling [from the root <italic>balal</italic>] of the human semen with that of the animal,&#x201D; and so it also says of lying with a daughter-in-law that <italic>they have done &#x2018;tevel,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1479">295</xref></sup> meaning that father and son will become joined to her as one person, and she will lie with both of them together in thought.</p>
<p>18. AND THOU SHALT NOT TAKE A WOMAN TO HER SISTER, TO BE A RIVAL TO HER, TO UNCOVER HER NAKEDNESS, BESIDE THE OTHER IN HER LIFETIME. Here Scripture explains the reason for the prohibition, stating that it is not proper for you to take a woman in addition to her sister, to be a rival one to another, for it is fitting that they love one another and not be rivals. He did not say so with respect to a woman and her daughter,<sup><xref rid="fn1480">296</xref></sup> or a woman and her mother,<sup><xref rid="fn1471">287</xref></sup> because they are &#x201C;near of flesh&#x201D; and therefore forbidden even after the death of the other [while in the case of two sisters, it is only during the lifetime of his wife, even if she is already divorced from him, that he may not marry her sister].</p>
<p>19. AND UNTO A WOMAN DURING HER SEPARATION FOR HER UNCLEANNESS, THOU SHALT NOT APPROACH TO UNCOVER HER NAKEDNESS. Scripture prohibited [having intercourse with] a menstruant woman for the reason I have mentioned,<sup><xref rid="fn1481">297</xref></sup> that the Torah permitted sexual intercourse only for the sake of raising children,<sup><xref rid="fn1482">298</xref></sup> and since the whole child or the greater part thereof is created out of the woman&#x2019;s blood, as I have already mentioned,<sup><xref rid="fn1483">299</xref></sup> and from the blood of menstruation it is not created at all [therefore the Torah prohibited intercourse with her during the period of her impurity]. Indeed, how could a child be formed out of this blood, since it is deadly poisonous, capable of causing the death of any creature that drinks or eats it&#x0021; Now when the womb contains a large amount of this blood of menstruation, the woman cannot become pregnant, as this blood is not endowed at all with the capacity for forming [a child]. Even if she were to become pregnant from other blood, and then derive nourishment from this blood, the child would die. Physicians have also mentioned already that if the foetus derives nourishment from the best of blood, and all its nutriment be of the best quality, but some of this blood of menstruation is mixed with it, it will cause it to go bad, and produce in the child inflammatory swellings and sores of all kinds. And in the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup><xref rid="fn1484">300</xref></sup> even if a small part of this [blood of menstruation] remains, in the foetus, the child will be a leper. By virtue, then, of all these reasons it was fitting that the Torah prohibit intercourse with a menstruant. The doctors have also told us in connection with it, a true experience, which is one of <italic>the wondrous works of Him Who is perfect in knowledge</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1485">301</xref></sup> in creation, that if a menstruant woman at the beginning of her issue were to concentrate her gaze for some time upon a polished iron mirror, there would appear in the mirror red spots resembling drops of blood, for the bad part therein [i.e., in the issue] that is by its nature harmful, causes a certain odium, and the unhealthy condition of the air attaches to the mirror, just as a viper kills with its gaze. And surely it is harmful to have intercourse with her then, since physically and mentally she is attached to the man&#x2019;s body and mind. Therefore Scripture prohibited it by saying, <italic>and her impurity will be upon him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1486">302</xref></sup> meaning that her condition is a contagious one. It is with reference to this that it states, <italic>the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1487">303</xref></sup> always mentioning in connection with her the term &#x201C;impurity,&#x201D; which is like that used in speaking of a creeping thing and of a leper, in which cases their impurity is within their bodies. It is possible that this is the sense of the expression, <italic>he hath bared her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1488">304</xref></sup> for that blemished fountain should be covered, and not bared in order to draw its bad and extremely harmful waters. Thus intercourse has been prohibited to <italic>the holy seed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1489">305</xref></sup> all the days of her impurity, until she immerses herself in water [i.e., in a ritual pool],<sup><xref rid="fn1490">306</xref></sup> for then she will be purified also in her thoughts,<sup><xref rid="fn1491">307</xref></sup> and become completely clean [in body and mind].</p>
<p>20. AND THOU SHALT NOT LIE CARNALLY<sup><xref rid="fn1492">308</xref></sup> WITH THY NEIGHBOR&#x2019;S WIFE. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: &#x201C;For there is a threefold purpose to sexual intercourse: one is to beget children, a second is to relieve the body of its fluids, and the third is for passion, which is likened to that of the animals. Now when Scripture said <italic>l&#x2019;zara</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1492">308</xref></sup> it means &#x2018;even <italic>l&#x2019;zara</italic>&#x2019; [i.e., even for the purpose of begetting children], and thus it prohibited [having intercourse with another man&#x2019;s wife] altogether.&#x201D; It is possible that He said <italic>l&#x2019;zara</italic> in order to mention the reason for the prohibition, since it will not be known to whom &#x201C;the child&#x201D; belongs, and as a result, great and wicked abominations<sup><xref rid="fn1493">309</xref></sup> might be done by both.<sup><xref rid="fn1494">310</xref></sup> Now Scripture did not mention [this expression <italic>l&#x2019;zara</italic> further on when it speaks] of the punishment [for this sin],<sup><xref rid="fn1495">311</xref></sup> because even for intimacy of the first stage without emitting seed, he is already liable to punishment. It is for this reason that [in the case of a suspected adulteress] Scripture states, <italic>and a man lie with her carnally</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1496">312</xref></sup> for it is on account of the <italic>zera</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1497">313</xref></sup> that he suspects her. Similarly in the case of a betrothed bondswoman it also says, <italic>lieth carnally</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1498">314</xref></sup> with her, because the prohibition is on account of the child that he will beget from a bondwoman [who is betrothed to a Hebrew servant].<sup><xref rid="fn1499">315</xref></sup></p>
<p>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that since another man&#x2019;s wife is completely forbidden to one, <italic>whosoever toucheth her shall not go unpunished</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1500">316</xref></sup> therefore Scripture had to say here <italic>l&#x2019;zara</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1492">308</xref></sup> For had it said only: &#x201C;and thou shalt not lie with thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife,&#x201D; it would have appeared that it forbids [by punishment of excision] even lying with her just for embracing and kissing, since here [in this section] it speaks only of those forbidden relations that are punishable with excision. Therefore it was necessary to mention that the intimacy was <italic>l&#x2019;zara</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1492">308</xref></sup> in order to explain that He is prohibiting here sexual intercourse. This is also the reason for the expression in the case of the betrothed bondswoman,<sup><xref rid="fn1498">314</xref></sup> because she is like another man&#x2019;s wife. Similarly it states in the case of another man&#x2019;s wife, <italic>And the man that committeth adultery with another man&#x2019;s wife</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1501">317</xref></sup> and it does not state &#x201C;lieth,&#x201D; for it is not mere lying with her that He prohibits [under punishment of death]. He does not state here [in the verse before us forbidding intercourse with another man&#x2019;s wife], &#x201C;to uncover her nakedness,&#x201D; for He only mentions this expression with reference to the next of kin and a menstruant,<sup><xref rid="fn1502">318</xref></sup> since the prohibition there is because of the uncovering, just as He said, <italic>for he hath made naked his near kin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1503">319</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND THOU SHALT NOT GIVE ANY OF THY SEED &#x2018;L&#x2019;HA&#x2019;AVIR&#x2019; (TO PASS THROUGH)<sup><xref rid="fn1504">320</xref></sup> &#x2018;LAMOLECH&#x2019; (TO MOLECH). This was an idol the name of which was &#x201C;Molech.&#x201D; Scripture mentions it with the definite article,<sup><xref rid="fn1505">321</xref></sup> since it was well-known to them from Egypt. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that it is possible that Molech is identical with <italic>Milcom the detestation of the Ammonites</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1506">322</xref></sup> And so indeed it would appear, for it is written, <italic>Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the detestation of Moab &#x2026; and for Molech the detestation of the children of Ammon</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1507">323</xref></sup> And this [name Milcom] was also well-known to them.<sup><xref rid="fn1508">324</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Rashi commented: &#x201C;And this was the manner in which the Molech was worshipped: he [the father] would hand over his son to the priests, and the priests lit two large pyres [one opposite the other], and they made the child pass on foot between the two fires. <italic>Thou shalt not give</italic>, this refers to [the father] handing over [the child] to the priests. <italic>&#x2018;L&#x2019;ha&#x2019;avir lamolech&#x2019;</italic> is the passing through the open fire.&#x201D; But this is not correct. For the Rabbis have already said in the Gemara of Tractate Sanhedrin:<sup><xref rid="fn1509">325</xref></sup> &#x201C;If he made him pass on foot [between the fires] the father is free from punishment [because that was not the customary way of worshipping the idol]; rather, [he is liable only if it was] &#x2018;like a leaping place of Purim,&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1510">326</xref></sup> meaning that he made him pass through the actual fire [by leaping through it]. Scripture mentions [both conditions to make the father liable to punishment]: a &#x201C;giving&#x201D; as it is said, <italic>and thou shalt not &#x2018;give&#x2019; any of thy seed</italic> &#x2026;], and the act of making him &#x201C;pass through the fire&#x201D; [as it is said in Deuteronomy 18:10: <italic>There shall not be found among you anyone that &#x2018;maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire&#x2019;</italic>], so that the father does not incur punishment unless he delivers his child to the priests [of Molech] and he [i.e., the father] made him pass through the fire, as is explained in Tractate Sanhedrin.<sup><xref rid="fn1509">325</xref></sup> Similarly, that which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote that the father hands him over to the priests and they make him pass through the fire &#x2014; and so he wrote also in his commentaries to Tractate Sanhedrin<sup><xref rid="fn1511">327</xref></sup> &#x2014; that does not appear to be so from the language of the Rabbis here in the Gemara.<sup><xref rid="fn1512">328</xref></sup> Moreover, how could the father be liable to death for the worship of Molech done by others [i.e., the priests]?<sup><xref rid="fn1513">329</xref></sup> The very language of Scripture, <italic>that maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1514">330</xref></sup> indicates that it is the father himself who passes him through the fire. Rather, the matter is as follows: the father himself delivers the child to the priests in the name of their detestation. It is with reference to this that it is written, <italic>he hath &#x2018;given&#x2019; his seed unto Molech</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1515">331</xref></sup> similar to what is done within the Sanctuary precincts, as it is written, <italic>and he shall give them unto the priest</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1516">332</xref></sup> Perhaps the priests waved the child before the Molech, or brought it near the idol, and then they returned it to the hands of the father, and he took him and passed him through the open flame, this being the sense of the expression, <italic>he that maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1514">330</xref></sup> And so the Rabbis have said in the Yerushalmi:<sup><xref rid="fn1517">333</xref></sup> &#x201C;[The penalty of death] is never incurred [by the father] unless he delivers the child to the priests, and then he [the father] takes him and passes him through the fire,&#x201D; that is to say, he takes the child from the priests, and he himself passes him through the fire. However, there was no actual burning of the child. For the Rabbis have said,<sup><xref rid="fn1509">325</xref></sup> &#x201C;If one passed himself through the fire, he is not liable&#x201D; [to death], which shows that the offender is alive even after he has passed through the fire. And so did Rashi explain [that there was no actual burning of the child].<sup><xref rid="fn1509">325</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet notwithstanding all this, it appears to me on the basis of decisive verses that the child <italic>was</italic> actually consumed by the flames, for Scripture states, <italic>and their sons, whom they bore unto Me, they have also made them pass through unto them &#x2018;to be devoured,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1518">334</xref></sup> and further on there it says, <italic>and when they had slain their children to their idols</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1519">335</xref></sup> meaning that they passed him through the fire until he was burnt or died in the fire, this being &#x201C;the slaying&#x201D; [mentioned in the verse], for the expression <italic>they have made them pass through unto them</italic> is a reference to the worship of Molech, and Scripture states <italic>to be devoured</italic> and also mentions the term slaying&#x0021; If so, when the Rabbis said [with reference to the Molech that it was] &#x201C;like a leaping place of Purim,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1510">326</xref></sup> they meant to say that they made the child pass through the flame many times, until he died in the burning fire. Thus by law of the Torah the father is liable to punishment from the moment of the child&#x2019;s first passing through, as soon as the fire takes hold of him, such as where one of his limbs took fire. It is for this reason that the Rabbis had to say that he who passes himself through the fire is not liable, [since the liability to punishment begins at the moment when the fire takes hold of one of his limbs, when he is still alive]. But the fire actually consumed the victim, as this was their sacrifice to Molech. And the expression of <italic>ma&#x2019;avir ba&#x2019;eish</italic> [which until now we have understood as &#x201C;passing through the fire&#x201D;] always denotes &#x201C;something burnt by fire, but not [totally] consumed thereby,&#x201D; for they used to put [the victim] in the fire, and then remove the body from there, and not let it turn into ashes like burnt [sacrifices], similar to utensils of gentiles [which, in order to be purified from the forbidden food they have absorbed], are made white-hot in the flame, and it is said of them, <italic>ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1520">336</xref></sup> And it is said of the Ammonites, <italic>and he made them pass through the brick-kiln</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1521">337</xref></sup> meaning that he burnt them just as they do to bricks in a baking furnace. If so, <italic>&#x2018;ma&#x2019;avir&#x2019; his son or his daughter through the fire</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1514">330</xref></sup> means placing him in the fire so that it should take hold of him, not merely passing him through it. And this is the meaning of <italic>ha&#x2019;avarah</italic> which is mentioned in connection with the Molech, which was by fire according to the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup><xref rid="fn1509">325</xref></sup> who derived it by means of a similarity of the term <italic>ha&#x2019;avarah</italic> [&#x201C;passing through,&#x201D; mentioned here in the verse before us, and in Deuteronomy 18:10]: &#x201C;just as there the &#x2018;passing through&#x2019; is in fire [as it is said, <italic>There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter &#x2018;pass through the fire&#x2019;</italic>], so here too the meaning is through the fire [although it is not clearly stated], and just as here it is to the Molech, so there too it is to Molech.&#x201D; Proof to the words of the Rabbis [that the meaning of this &#x2018;passing through&#x2019; mentioned here was by fire], is that which is written of King Josiah, <italic>And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1522">338</xref></sup> Thus the term <italic>ha&#x2019;avarah</italic> (&#x2018;passing through&#x2019;) mentioned here in connection with Molech means by fire. So also is it written of King Manasseh: <italic>He also made his children &#x2018;to pass through the fire&#x2019; in the valley of the son of Hinnom</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1523">339</xref></sup> And I have found it written of King Ahaz, <italic>And he also made his son &#x2018;to pass through the fire,&#x2019; according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the Eternal cast out from before the children of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1524">340</xref></sup> and in the Book of Chronicles it is stated [of the same king], <italic>and &#x2018;he burnt&#x2019; his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen whom the Eternal cast out</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1525">341</xref></sup> If so, <italic>ha&#x2019;avarah</italic> (the &#x2018;passing through&#x2019;) in fact was a burning with real fire.<sup><xref rid="fn1526">342</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now that which Scripture states, <italic>and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1527">343</xref></sup> [and it does not mention Molech], that was another idol, which was worshipped by burning the victims <italic>completely</italic> as a sacrifice [which was burnt to ashes]. They used to worship the Baal in a similar manner, as it is written of Jeremiah, <italic>Go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1528">344</xref></sup> and there it says further, <italic>and they have filled this place with the blood of innocents; and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire &#x2018;for burnt-offerings&#x2019; unto Baal; which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into My mind</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1529">345</xref></sup> And it is further written, <italic>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to make their sons and their daughters pass through unto Molech; which I commanded not, neither came it into My mind, that they should do this abomination</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1530">346</xref></sup> However, due to the fact that these two [last mentioned] verses speak of <italic>the high places of Baal</italic>, both being in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and the admonition in connection with both of them is identical: <italic>which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into My mind</italic>, and the Molech was [also] there in that impure place, as it is written in connection with King Josiah,<sup><xref rid="fn1531">347</xref></sup> it would appear from all this that they used to burn their children as sacrifices to Molech, which was the Baal, both names being closely associated, and meaning royalty and lordship. This is not the Baal of Peor<sup><xref rid="fn1532">348</xref></sup> or Baal-zebub,<sup><xref rid="fn1533">349</xref></sup> for this one [referred to by Jeremiah] was called Baal without any qualification, as Molech was so called, [without any qualification]. Scripture mentions in connection with the worship thereof the term <italic>ha&#x2019;avarah</italic> (passing through),<sup><xref rid="fn1530">346</xref></sup> because the main act of worship was by passing the children through [the two pyres] until the fire took hold of them, and it calls it &#x201C;burning&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1529">345</xref></sup> because they would die there. That is why they are called &#x201C;burnt-offerings&#x201D; [as it is said, <italic>to burn their sons in the fire for burnt-offerings</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1529">345</xref></sup> Similarly, I am of the opinion that <italic>the gods of Sepharvaim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1527">343</xref></sup> are also identified with Molech, for their surnames [Adrammelech and Anammelech]<sup><xref rid="fn1527">343</xref></sup> denote kingship [as the word <italic>melech</italic> indicates]. Both of them were worshipped in the same way, although one was called Adra,<sup><xref rid="fn1534">350</xref></sup> which is an expression of respect, and the second was called Ana which is of the root <italic>oneh</italic> (answers),<sup><xref rid="fn1535">351</xref></sup> and the name &#x201C;melech&#x201D; was attached to both, which is like Molech. The &#x201C;burning&#x201D; mentioned in connection with them<sup><xref rid="fn1527">343</xref></sup> was the death of the victims by fire, as I have explained [above]. But if we were to say that these detestations [Adrammelech and Anammelech] were not the Molech, then it is possible that because they were worshipped by means of sons and daughters being brought to them in fire, in a similar manner to that which it says about the Molech, therefore their names [Adra and Ana] were combined with his name, and form a <italic>melech</italic> (king) or Baal, but the modes of worship were not the same. For the Molech was worshipped with &#x201C;passing through&#x201D; [the fire], and the gods of Sepharvaim with burning,<sup><xref rid="fn1527">343</xref></sup> and the Baal with slaughtering first and then burning, like burnt-offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn1529">345</xref></sup> And it is further said [in Jeremiah] that in the place of the <italic>Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1522">338</xref></sup> there were also high places to Baal [as mentioned in connection with King Josiah, that he defiled that place so <italic>that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech</italic>], and it also mentions there the Molech [and Molech and Baal were to some extent identical, as stated above]. Thus that which Scripture states, <italic>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to make their sons and their daughters to pass through unto Molech</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1530">346</xref></sup> [which would seem to indicate that Molech and Baal are <italic>entirely</italic> identical, contrary to what we have said above], really means: &#x201C;and&#x201D; <italic>to make their sons and their daughters pass through</italic> [the fire] <italic>unto Molech</italic>.</p>
<p>Now our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1536">352</xref></sup> &#x201C;The father of Hezekiah king of Judah too [i.e., Ahaz] wanted to do so to him [in his infancy], and to burn him in the fire, but his mother saved him from death by rubbing him with the oil of<sup><xref rid="fn1537">353</xref></sup> a salamander.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1538">354</xref></sup> Now Ahaz &#x201C;made him pass through&#x201D; to Molech, as it is written, <italic>And he also made his son &#x2018;to pass through&#x2019; the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the Eternal cast out from before the children of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1525">341</xref></sup> this expression being identical to that used in the case of Molech; if so, [the &#x201C;passing through&#x201D; to Molech] meant actual burning until the fire took hold of the victim and he died. However, the righteous [Hezekiah] was saved by this salamander, which the Holy One, blessed be He, created for his sake.</p>
<p>By way of the simple meaning of Scripture they<sup><xref rid="fn1539">355</xref></sup> have said that the matter of &#x201C;making a son or daughter pass through the fire&#x201D; was one of the forms of sorcery, for it is in connection with sorcery that it is said, <italic>There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire, one that useth divination, a soothsayer, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1540">356</xref></sup> And in the case of King Manasseh Scripture likewise states, <italic>He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised soothsaying, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery and appointed them that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1541">357</xref></sup> and it is further written, <italic>and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1542">358</xref></sup> [these verses indicating that the rite of &#x201C;passing through the fire&#x201D; was some form of witchcraft], and the Molech was an idol to which they offered little children.<sup><xref rid="fn1543">359</xref></sup> But since we have found it written, <italic>that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1544">360</xref></sup> [which shows clearly that &#x201C;passing through the fire&#x201D; was in connection with the worship of Molech], the words of our Rabbis that all forms of worshipping Molech were by fire, have been shown to be trustworthy. But it is [also] possible [as the verses indicate] that they used this rite for false divination and to prophesy by means of it, according to their foolishness, these being the prophets of Baal who would first offer to him sacrifices of children, and then have vain dreams and <italic>a lying divination</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1545">361</xref></sup> Therefore the Torah associates the matter of the Molech with that of [the various kinds of] divination. For here [in the Book of Leviticus] it placed [the subject of the Molech] immediately before <italic>the soul that turneth unto the ghosts, and unto the familiar spirits</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1546">362</xref></sup> and in the Book of Deuteronomy<sup><xref rid="fn1547">363</xref></sup> the whole section is devoted to the subject of those who predict the future falsely.</p>
<p>Now Scripture [here in the verse before us] states that the act of passing children through the fire to Molech constitutes a profaning of G-d&#x2019;s Name,<sup><xref rid="fn1548">364</xref></sup> and in the other section [i.e., in <italic>Seder Kedoshim</italic>] it adds, <italic>to defile My Sanctuary, and to profane My Holy Name</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1549">365</xref></sup> Perhaps the meaning thereof is as follows: [To give of one&#x2019;s children to Molech is] &#x201C;<italic>to defile</italic> the people that is sanctified to My Name, whom I commanded, <italic>Sanctify yourselves, and be ye holy, for I the Eternal, Who sanctify you, am holy;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1550">366</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>And to profane My holy Name</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1549">365</xref></sup> when they commit this serious sin before Me.&#x201D; For thus He speaks of the serious sins, such as, <italic>and a man and his father go unto the same maid, to profane My holy Name</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1551">367</xref></sup> It is possible that He says so [<italic>to defile My Sanctuary</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1549">365</xref></sup> in connection with the Molech], because a father who sacrifices of his seed to Molech and afterwards comes into G-d&#x2019;s Sanctuary to bring an offering, defiles the Sanctuary, as his offerings are defiled and are an abomination to G-d, and he himself is forever defiled, having become impure by the evil he did; just as He said of [those who turn to] the ghosts and the familiar spirits, <italic>seek them not out, to be defiled by them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1552">368</xref></sup> and it is further written, <italic>and because they had defiled it with their idols</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1553">369</xref></sup> And He also mentions [in connection with the Molech] the profaning of G-d&#x2019;s Name [as it says, <italic>and to profane My holy Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1549">365</xref></sup>], because when the nations hear that he honored the Molech with his seed, and to G-d he brought an offering of his cattle, it will be a profaning of G-d&#x2019;s Name. It is concerning this that the prophet Ezekiel said, <italic>and their sons, whom they bore unto Me, they have also made them pass through unto them to be devoured. Moreover this they have done unto Me: they have defiled My Sanctuary in the same day</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1554">370</xref></sup> And the prophet continues, <italic>For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into My Sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of My house</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1555">371</xref></sup></p>
<p>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], Israel <italic>the holy seed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1556">372</xref></sup> is born in the house of G-d, this being the meaning of the expression <italic>whom they bore unto Me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1557">373</xref></sup> Thus he who sacrifices one of G-d&#x2019;s people to the Molech, defiles G-d&#x2019;s Sanctuary and profanes His Great Name, similar to the expression, <italic>And he</italic> [i.e., the High Priest] <italic>shall not profane his seed among his people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1558">374</xref></sup> It is for this reason that He said [of the person who gives of his seed to Molech], <italic>And I will set My face against that man</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1559">375</xref></sup> [and again], <italic>Then will I set My face against that man</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1560">376</xref></sup> The student learned in the mystic lore of the Cabala will understand.</p>
<p>Now the reason for the prohibitions against lying carnally with a male,<sup><xref rid="fn1561">377</xref></sup> or an animal,<sup><xref rid="fn1562">378</xref></sup> is well-known, as it is an abominable act and is not for the preservation of the human species, because [the copulation] of [male and male or of] man and animal will not beget offspring. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented:<sup><xref rid="fn1561">377</xref></sup> &#x201C;Since we find [Lot&#x2019;s daughter using] the expression, <italic>Behold, &#x2018;shachavti&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>I lay</italic>) <italic>yesternight with my father</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1563">379</xref></sup> [and she did not say, <italic>nishkavti</italic>, in the passive, or &#x201C;Behold, <italic>shachav imi avi</italic>, &#x2014; my father lay with me,&#x201D; this shows that the term <italic>shachav</italic>, although in the active form, refers to the person who commits that act as well as the passive partner who permits herself or himself to be thus abused]; thus it follows that the verse, <italic>And with a male &#x2018;lo thishkav&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thou shalt not lie</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1561">377</xref></sup> constitutes a prohibition both against the one who actively commits pederasty, and against the one who permits himself to be thus abused.&#x201D; [Thus far are the words of Ibn Ezra.] But if it be as Ibn Ezra said, why is the woman not included in the verse, <italic>And thou shalt not lie with any beast</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1562">378</xref></sup> [and it is clear that she is not so included from the fact that Scripture had to continue, <italic>Neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1562">378</xref></sup> for women are included in all admonitions of the Torah? Rather, the use of the expression, <italic>Behold, &#x2018;shachavti&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>I lay</italic>) <italic>yesternight with my father</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1563">379</xref></sup> is due to the fact that it was Lot&#x2019;s daughters who, through lying with him, [were instrumental in that affair] in order to beget seed of him. As is known, the seed comes either from the movement of the whole body, just as foam is formed in the mouths of galloping horses, or it is brought forth in the veins nearby [the sexual organ], where it gathers by the continuing motion thereof until it is emitted. Were they then not to have lain with Lot, his seed would not have come forth, for in his drunkenness he was like a silent stone.</p>
<p>25. AND THE LAND WAS DEFILED, THEREFORE DID I VISIT THE INIQUITY THEREOF UPON IT, AND THE LAND VOMITED OUT HER INHABITANTS. Scripture was very strict in forbidding these sexual relationships on account of the Land which becomes defiled by them, and which in turn will vomit out the people that do [these abominations]. Now forbidden sexual relationships are matters affecting personal conduct, and do not depend on the Land, [so why should the Land be affected by these personal immoral acts]? But the secret of the matter is in the verse which states, <italic>When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when He separated the children of men, He set the borders of the people</italic>, etc. <italic>For the portion of the Eternal is His people</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1564">380</xref></sup> The meaning thereof is as follows: <italic>The Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1565">381</xref></sup> created everything and He placed the power of the lower creatures in the higher beings, giving over each and every nation <italic>in their lands, after their nations</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1566">382</xref></sup> some known star or constellation, as is known by means of astrological speculation. It is with reference to this that it is said, <italic>which the Eternal thy G-d hath allotted unto all the people</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1567">383</xref></sup> for He allotted to all nations constellations in the heavens, and higher above them are the angels of the Supreme One whom He placed as lords over them, as it is written, <italic>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1568">384</xref></sup> and it is written, <italic>lo, the prince of Greece shall come</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1569">385</xref></sup> They are called &#x201C;kings,&#x201D; as it is written [there], <italic>and I was left over there beside the kings of Persia</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1568">384</xref></sup> Now <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1565">381</xref></sup> is <italic>G-d of gods, and Lord of lords</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1570">386</xref></sup> over the whole world. But the Land of Israel, which is in the middle of the inhabited earth,<sup><xref rid="fn1571">387</xref></sup> is the inheritance of the Eternal designated to His Name. He has placed none of the angels as <italic>chief, observer, or ruler</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1572">388</xref></sup> over it, since He gave it as a heritage to His people who declare the Unity of His Name, the seed of His beloved ones [i.e., the patriarchs]. It is with reference to this that He said, <italic>and ye shall be Mine own treasure from among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1573">389</xref></sup> and it is further written, <italic>so shall ye be My people, and I will be your G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1574">390</xref></sup> and you will not be subject to other powers at all. Now He [also] sanctified the people who dwell in His Land with the sanctity of observing the laws against forbidden sexual relationships, and with the abundant commandments, so that they [His people] would be dedicated to His Name. It is for this reason that He said, <italic>And ye shall keep all My statutes, and all Mine ordinances, and do them, that the Land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1575">391</xref></sup> and it is further written, <italic>But I have said unto you: &#x2018;Ye shall inherit their Land, and I will give it unto you to possess it&#x2019; &#x2026; I am the Eternal your G-d, Who have set you apart from the peoples</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1576">392</xref></sup> meaning to say, that He has set us apart from all the nations over whom He appointed princes and other celestial powers, by giving us the Land [of Israel] so that He, blessed be He, will be our G-d, and we will be dedicated to His Name. Thus the Land which is the inheritance of the Glorious Name, will vomit out all those who defile it and will not tolerate worshippers of idols, nor those who practise immorality. Now this section mentioned the Molech,<sup><xref rid="fn1577">393</xref></sup> which is a form of idolatry, together with the forbidden sexual relationships, and with reference to all of them He said, <italic>Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things; for in all of these the nations are defiled</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1578">394</xref></sup> <italic>and the Land vomited out her inhabitants</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1579">395</xref></sup> [thus showing that the Land is unable to contain idol worshippers or those who practise immorality]. And so also did He say in the second section [i.e., in <italic>Seder Kedoshim</italic>], <italic>and I have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be Mine</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1580">396</xref></sup> which is [the basis for] the strict prohibition against idolatry. Therefore He stated that it is because they are dedicated to His Name that He gave them the Land, as it is said, <italic>And I have said unto you: &#x2018;Ye shall inherit their Land, and I will give it unto you to possess it&#x2019; &#x2026; I am the Eternal your G-d, Who have set you apart from the peoples</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1576">392</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now outside the Land of Israel, although it all belongs to <italic>the Glorious Name</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1565">381</xref></sup> yet its purity is not perfect, because of &#x201C;the servants&#x201D; who hold sway there, and the nations go astray after their princes to worship them as well. It is for this reason that Scripture states, <italic>the G-d of the whole earth shall He be called</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1581">397</xref></sup> since He is the G-d of gods Who rules over all, and He will in the end <italic>punish the host of the high heaven on high</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1582">398</xref></sup> removing the celestial powers and demolishing the array of &#x201C;the servants,&#x201D; and afterwards He will punish <italic>the kings of the earth upon the earth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1582">398</xref></sup> This is the meaning of the verse stating, <italic>The matter is by the decree of &#x2018;irin&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the wakeful ones</italic>), <italic>and &#x2018;sh&#x2019;elta&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the sentence</italic>) <italic>by the word of the holy ones</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1583">399</xref></sup> meaning, the matter that was decreed on Nebuchadnezzar [that he be driven from men and eat grass as oxen etc.] is the pronouncement of the guarding angels and the sentence of the word of the holy ones, who have ordained on the powers emanating from them that it be so. They [the angels] are called <italic>irin</italic> [literally: &#x201C;the wakeful ones&#x201D;], because from their emanations proceed all the powers that stir all activities, similar to that which it says, <italic>and behold &#x2018;ir&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a wakeful one</italic>) <italic>and a holy one came down from heaven. He cried aloud, and said thus: &#x2018;Hew down the tree</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1584">400</xref></sup> &#x2014; [In the verse ] <italic>And &#x2018;sh&#x2019;elta&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the sentence</italic>) <italic>is by word of the holy ones</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1583">399</xref></sup> [the word <italic>sh&#x2019;elta</italic>] is like <italic>sha&#x2019;alu</italic>, meaning first &#x201C;they ask&#x201D; what is the will of the Supreme One about it, and afterwards they decree that it be so done. It is with reference to this that Daniel told Nebuchadnezzar, <italic>it is the decree of the Most High</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1585">401</xref></sup> for everything is from Him, blessed be He.</p>
<p>Thus <italic>the Glorious Name</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1565">381</xref></sup> blessed be He, <italic>is G-d of gods</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1570">386</xref></sup> in the whole world, and G-d of the Land of Israel which is <italic>the inheritance of the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1586">402</xref></sup> This is the meaning of the expression, <italic>and he will go astray after the foreign gods of the Land</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1587">403</xref></sup> for the gods are foreign to the Land of G-d and His inheritance. This is what Scripture means when it states [of the Cutheans who were settled by the king of Assyria in the cities of the kingdom of Israel], <italic>they knew not the manner of the G-d of the Land; therefore He hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the G-d of the Land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1588">404</xref></sup> Now the Cutheans were not punished in their own land when they worshipped their gods, by G-d sending lions among them, but only when they came into the Land of G-d and conducted themselves as before, did He send lions among them who slew them. And so the Rabbis taught in the Sifra:<sup><xref rid="fn1589">405</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And the Land vomit not you out also</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1590">406</xref></sup> The Land of Israel is unlike other lands; it is unable to contain sinners.&#x201D; And in the Sifre we find that the Rabbis taught:<sup><xref rid="fn1591">407</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And there was no strange god with Him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1592">408</xref></sup> [when He took Israel out of Egypt, and protected them during their wandering through the wilderness], so that none of the princes of the nations should have power to come and exercise authority over you, something like that which it is said, <italic>and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come</italic>, etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1569">385</xref></sup> This is the meaning of the saying of the Rabbis:<sup><xref rid="fn1593">409</xref></sup> &#x201C;Whoever lives outside the Land, is as if he had no G-d, for it is said, <italic>I am the Eternal your G-d, Who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be your G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1594">410</xref></sup> and it is further said, <italic>for they have driven me</italic> [David] <italic>out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of the Eternal, saying: Go, serve other gods</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1595">411</xref></sup> And in the Tosephta of Tractate Abodah Zarah the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1596">412</xref></sup> &#x201C;Now it is said, <italic>And I</italic> [Jacob] <italic>will come back to my father&#x2019;s house in peace, then shall the Eternal be my G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1597">413</xref></sup> and it is further said, <italic>to give you the land of Canaan, to be your G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1594">410</xref></sup> When you are in the land of Canaan I am your G-d. When you are not in the land of Canaan, I am not your G-d if it were at all possible to say so [for He is our G-d under all circumstances and in all places]. Similarly it is said, <italic>about forty thousand ready armed for war passed on in the presence of the Eternal unto battle</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1598">414</xref></sup> and it is further said, <italic>and the Land is subdued before the Eternal, and before His people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1599">415</xref></sup> But how could it enter one&#x2019;s mind that Israel subdued the Land before the Eternal [as if to say that they captured it for His sake]? But [this teaches that] as long as they are upon the Land, it is as if it were subdued [before Him, since He is their G-d, as explained above], but when they are not upon it, it is not subdued.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is on the basis of this matter that the Rabbis have said in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn1600">416</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And ye perish quickly from off the good Land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1601">417</xref></sup> Although I banish you from the Land to outside the Land, make yourselves distinctive by the commandments, so that when you return they shall not be novelties to you. This can be compared to a master who was angry with his wife, and sent her back to her father&#x2019;s house and told her, &#x2018;Adorn yourself with precious things, so that when you come back they will not be novelties to you.&#x2019; And so did the prophet Jeremiah say [to the people in exile in Babylon], <italic>Set thee up waymarks</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1602">418</xref></sup> These are the commandments, by which Israel is made distinctive.&#x201D; Now the verses which state, <italic>and ye perish quickly &#x2026; and ye shall lay up these My words</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1603">419</xref></sup> only make obligatory in the exile [the observance of those commandments] affecting personal conduct, such as the [wearing of] phylacteries and [placing of] <italic>Mezuzoth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1604">420</xref></sup> [these being specifically mentioned there in the following words of Scripture], and concerning them the Rabbis [in the above text of the Sifre] explained [that we must observe them] so that they shall not be novelties to us when we return to the Land, for the main [fulfillment] of the commandments is [to be kept] when dwelling in the Land of G-d. Therefore the Rabbis have said in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn1605">421</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And ye shall possess it, and dwell therein. And ye shall observe to do all the statutes</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1606">422</xref></sup> Dwelling in the Land of Israel is of equal importance to all the commandments of the Torah.&#x201D; A similar statement is also found in the Tosephta of Tractate Abodah Zarah.<sup><xref rid="fn1607">423</xref></sup> This in fact was the thought of the wicked ones who [misusing the intention of the above statement], said to the prophet Ezekiel [whose prophetic activity was in the Babylonian exile]:<sup><xref rid="fn1608">424</xref></sup> &#x201C;Our master Ezekiel, if a servant is sold by his master, does the master still have any claim to him?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1609">425</xref></sup> For it is said, <italic>and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all; in that ye say: We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1610">426</xref></sup> And this was the command of our patriarch Jacob <italic>to his household, and to all that were with him</italic>, at the time that they came into the Land, <italic>Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify yourselves</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1611">427</xref></sup> And G-d, <italic>by Whom</italic> alone <italic>actions are weighed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1612">428</xref></sup> [brought it about] that Rachel died on the way when they started coming into the Land,<sup><xref rid="fn1613">429</xref></sup> for on account of her own merit she did not die outside the Land, and for Jacob&#x2019;s merit, he could not dwell in the Land with two sisters [in their lifetime, since this is forbidden in the Torah, and the laws of the Torah were observed by our ancestors in the Land of Israel even before the Torah was given on Sinai], and she [Rachel] was the one by whose marriage the prohibition against two sisters took effect [since Jacob was already married to Leah]. It would appear that Rachel became pregnant with Benjamin before they came to Shechem, and while in the Land Jacob did not touch her at all, for the reason that we have mentioned. And the prophet states, <italic>And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have profaned My Land; they have filled Mine inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable things and their abominations</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1614">430</xref></sup> This matter [i.e., that the Land of Israel is the inheritance of the Eternal and thus cannot tolerate sinners] is found in many places in the Scriptures, and you will see it clearly after I have opened your eyes to it.</p>
<p>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented in the section of <italic>Vayeilech:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1615">431</xref></sup> &#x201C;We know that G-d is One, and changes arise because of those who receive [His beneficent deeds], but G-d does not change His deeds, as they are all done in wisdom. And included in the worship of G-d is to guard the ability to receive [His beneficence] according to the place [so that if a particular place is holier than others, one must observe there more strictly the laws of holiness]. Therefore it is written [of the Cutheans, that they did not know] <italic>the manner of the G-d of the Land</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1616">432</xref></sup> and of Jacob it is said [when he came into the Land he told his household], <italic>put away the strange gods</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1611">427</xref></sup> and the extreme opposite of [the sanctity of] the place [i.e., the Land of Israel] is indulging in forbidden sexual relationships, as they are [sins of the] flesh. The student versed [in the mysteries of the Torah] will understand.&#x201D; Thus are the words [of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra] of blessed memory.</p>
<p>Now do not refute me [in what I have written above, that Israel is under the direct guidance of G-d alone, and no celestial power determines their fate], by citing the verse, <italic>Michael your prince</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1617">433</xref></sup> for he is only a ministering angel who implores mercy for Israel, but is in no way a prince exercising any royalty or power. So was also <italic>the captain of the host</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1618">434</xref></sup> who appeared to Joshua at Jericho, showing him that G-d had sent him to fight their battles, similar to [that which happened in the days of] Hezekiah.<sup><xref rid="fn1619">435</xref></sup> Besides, this matter [of Michael imploring mercy for Israel] was when we were already outside the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>Now I do not have permission to explain on the subject of <italic>ha&#x2019;aretz</italic> (&#x201C;the earth&#x201D; or &#x201C;the Land&#x201D;) more than this.<sup><xref rid="fn1620">436</xref></sup> But if you will merit to understand the first &#x201C;earth&#x201D; mentioned in the verse of <italic>Bereshith</italic> (<italic>In the beginning G-d created the heaven and the earth</italic>), and also the one mentioned in the section of <italic>Im Bechukothai</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1621">437</xref></sup> you will know a profound and sublime secret, and you will further understand what our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1622">438</xref></sup> &#x201C;The Sanctuary on high is exactly opposite the Sanctuary below.&#x201D; I have already alluded to this on the verse, <italic>for all the earth is Mine</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1623">439</xref></sup> Now Scripture mentions that the people of the land of Canaan were punished on account of their immoral [sexual] deeds. And our Rabbis have said that they were warned about these matters from the time of creation, when these laws were declared to Adam<sup><xref rid="fn1624">440</xref></sup> and to Noah,<sup><xref rid="fn1625">441</xref></sup> for He does not punish unless He admonishes first. Scripture, however, did not state the admonition, but instead said that the Land would vomit them out, for the Land abhors <italic>all these abominations</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1626">442</xref></sup> Now the Canaanites were not the only ones who were admonished about these matters [for since these laws were declared to Adam and Noah, they applied to all mankind], and the Scriptural section mentions specifically, <italic>After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1627">443</xref></sup> which proves that the Egyptians also did all these abominations, and yet the land of Egypt did not vomit them out, nor did the lands of other nations vomit them out&#x0021; Rather, this whole subject shows the distinction of the Land [of Israel] and its holiness [so that it alone is unable to retain sinners]. Scripture states, <italic>and the Land vomited out</italic> [using a past tense, although the Canaanites were still living there], for from the time that He was to punish [them] for the sins committed upon her [i.e. the Land], having decreed destruction upon the Canaanites, it is as if the Land had already vomited them out. Or it may be that the expression, <italic>and the Land vomited out</italic> is a reference to above, similar to what is said, <italic>their defense is removed from over them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1628">444</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND THE SOULS THAT DO THEM SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM AMONG THEIR PEOPLE. &#x201C;His offspring is cut off, and his [own] days are shortened.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.<sup><xref rid="fn1629">445</xref></sup> Now in the matters of excision mentioned in the Torah there are three different expressions. One is that which states, <italic>that man shall be cut off;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1630">446</xref></sup> a second one is that which says, <italic>and the souls which do them shall be cut off</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1631">447</xref></sup> or <italic>that soul shall be cut off from before Me;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1632">448</xref></sup> and a third form of expression is that which states, <italic>that soul shall utterly be cut off, his iniquity shall be upon him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1633">449</xref></sup> Now of a [a person doing work on] the Day of Atonement Scripture states, <italic>that soul will I destroy from among his people</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1634">450</xref></sup> and on this the Rabbis commented in the Sifra:<sup><xref rid="fn1635">451</xref></sup> &#x201C;Excision is mentioned in many places in Scripture. But I do not know what it is. Now that it says, <italic>and I will destroy</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1634">450</xref></sup> it teaches that excision means &#x2018;destruction&#x2019; [of the soul].&#x201D;</p>
<p>The explanation of the subject is as follows. If someone eats forbidden fat or blood and he is [still] a righteous person whose merits outweigh [his sins], but he could not control his desire for it, and thus stumbled in this sin, his days will be shortened and he will die in his youth before reaching old age, which is sixty years,<sup><xref rid="fn1636">452</xref></sup> but his soul is not destined for destruction;<sup><xref rid="fn1637">453</xref></sup> rather, its portion will be in the World of Souls<sup><xref rid="fn1638">454</xref></sup> in accordance with the person&#x2019;s good deeds, since he was a righteous man, and he will also have a portion in the World to Come, which is the world after the resurrection. Of this case it is said, <italic>that man shall be cut off</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1630">446</xref></sup> But [in the case of] one who, as a result of this grave sin, now has more sins [in gravity] than his merits, the punishment of excision for this weighty transgression affects the soul that sins after it is separated from the body, and it is cut off from life in the World of Souls.<sup><xref rid="fn1638">454</xref></sup> It is with reference to those liable to this form of excision that Scripture alludes, in saying, <italic>that soul shall be cut off from before Me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1632">448</xref></sup> And it is further written [in this connection], <italic>that soul will I destroy from among his people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1634">450</xref></sup> These sinners do not suffer bodily excision [as is the case in the first type mentioned above], but may sometimes live to reach many days, even old age and hoary heads, as it is written, <italic>and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his evil-doing</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1639">455</xref></sup> It is this which our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1640">456</xref></sup> &#x201C;But he whose sins outweigh his merits, including a non-Jew<sup><xref rid="fn1641">457</xref></sup> who sins with his body &#x2014; and Rav Papa said that this refers to a particular sin, that is to say, one who commits incest with one of the forbidden relations &#x2014; these descend to Gehenna and they are punished for twelve months; after twelve months their bodies are destroyed, and their souls burnt, and the winds scatter [their ashes] under the soles of the feet of the righteous etc.&#x201D; And there is a still more stringent form of excision, where both the body is cut off [from life in this world] and the soul [even from life in the World to Come]. It is of this [third kind of excision mentioned above] that it is said, <italic>Because he hath despised the word of the Eternal, and hath broken His commandment, that soul &#x2018;hikareith tikareith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>shall be utterly cut off</italic>), <italic>his iniquity shall be upon him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1633">449</xref></sup> And the Rabbis interpreted it:<sup><xref rid="fn1642">458</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>&#x2018;Hikareith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he shall be cut off</italic>) in this world; <italic>&#x2018;tikareith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he shall be cut off</italic>) in the World to Come,&#x201D; meaning to say that he shall die in his youth, and his <italic>life shall be as that of the depraved</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1643">459</xref></sup> in that his soul will not share in the life after the resurrection and he will have no portion in the World to Come. This double expression of excision is not stated in the Torah except in matters of idolatry and blasphemy. Our Rabbis have further interpreted in Tractate Shebuoth:<sup><xref rid="fn1642">458</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Because he hath despised the word of the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1633">449</xref></sup> This refers to one who throws off the yoke, [i.e., he denies the essential principle of the religion], and perverts the sense of the Torah. <italic>And he hath broken His commandment</italic>. This is one who breaks the covenant of the flesh&#x201D; [i.e., circumcision]. But this does not apply to all cases where excision is mentioned, it being explained there in the Gemara<sup><xref rid="fn1642">458</xref></sup> that the double expression of <italic>&#x2018;hikareith tikareith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he shall utterly be cut off</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1633">449</xref></sup> does not apply to all other people who are liable to excision by law of the Torah, except for those derived by interpretation of this verse; since this verse refers to a blasphemer and a worshipper of idols, and the Rabbis added by interpretations, those who deny the essential principle [of G-d&#x2019;s existence], and those hardened wicked ones [mentioned above]. This is similar to that which is said of them in the tradition,<sup><xref rid="fn1644">460</xref></sup> <italic>for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1645">461</xref></sup> These are the ones who are enumerated in the Mishnah<sup><xref rid="fn1646">462</xref></sup> and in the Beraitha:<sup><xref rid="fn1647">463</xref></sup> &#x201C;And these are they that have no share in the World to Come.&#x201D; And so also it appears, that not all those liable to excision are punishable by the death of their offspring, except for those where the word <italic>aririm</italic> (childless) is mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1648">464</xref></sup> And it is possible that all forbidden [sexual] relationships have been likened to each other [in this respect of the punishment, namely death of the offspring], but in the case of other sins for which excision is incurred, such as for eating forbidden fat and blood, we do not have [this aspect of punishment].</p>
<p>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented:<sup><xref rid="fn1649">465</xref></sup> &#x201C;There is a difference between <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;ha&#x2019;avad&#x2019;ti&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and I will destroy</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1634">450</xref></sup> and <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;nichr&#x2019;thah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>it shall be cut off</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1632">448</xref></sup> and I could not explain.&#x201D; The learned scholar [Rabbi Abraham] thought that the soul that is &#x201C;destroyed&#x201D; is destroyed for ever, and the one that is &#x201C;cut off&#x201D; is denied life for a time, <italic>and yet doth G-d not take away life</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1650">466</xref></sup></p>
<p>Know and understand that the forms of excision mentioned with reference to the soul, constitute a great [source for] trust in the existence of souls after death, and the granting of reward in the World of Souls.<sup><xref rid="fn1638">454</xref></sup> For in His saying, blessed be He, <italic>and that soul shall be cut off from among his people</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1651">467</xref></sup> <italic>or that soul shall be cut off from before Me</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1632">448</xref></sup> it denotes that <italic>the soul that sinneth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1652">468</xref></sup> shall be cut off in its iniquity, but other souls that did not sin, will exist before Him in the splendor on high. It is for this reason that He explains, <italic>that soul &#x2026; its iniquity shall be upon it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1653">469</xref></sup> for it is the sin that is in it which will cause it to be cut off. And the meaning of the matter is that <italic>the soul of man is the lamp of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1654">470</xref></sup> which has been breathed into our nostrils<sup><xref rid="fn1655">471</xref></sup> <italic>out of the mouth of the Most High</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1656">472</xref></sup> and <italic>the spirit of G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1657">473</xref></sup> as it is said, <italic>And He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1655">471</xref></sup> and so it remains in its [original] state and does not die [with the death of the body], for it is not a composite [of the four elements] so that it be subject to the law of existence and decomposition, as are all components. But the existence of the soul is fitting [for all time], living forever as do the Separate Intelligences.<sup><xref rid="fn1658">474</xref></sup> Therefore Scripture did not need to state that as a reward for [fulfillment of] the commandments the soul will exist [after the death of the body, for it is self-understood that it will exist from a knowledge of the nature of the soul], but instead it states that as a punishment for sins, the soul will be desecrated and defiled, and become cut off from its proper existence. This is the sense of the expression <italic>kareth</italic> (cutting off) which the Torah uses, intimating that it is like a branch cut off from the tree, from the roots of which it derives its nourishment. It is this which our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1659">475</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>From among his people</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1634">450</xref></sup> &#x2014; but his people are in peace.&#x201D; For the cutting off of <italic>the soul that sinneth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1652">468</xref></sup> proves the existence of all other souls that do not sin, these being <italic>his people</italic> [mentioned in the verse] which are in peace. And we have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn1660">476</xref></sup> that all assurances of the Torah, whether for reward or punishment, are all miraculous in nature, and are of the type of hidden miracles,<sup><xref rid="fn1661">477</xref></sup> the Torah always promising [certain blessings] in a non-natural manner [which result not from the processes of nature, but because of the observance of the law], and warning against [consequences which result not from the processes of nature, but as punishment for our violation of the law]. Therefore He warned here of <italic>kareth</italic> which is of a miraculous nature [since in the natural order of things the soul should exist forever], and did not promise the eternal existence of the soul [as a reward for observance of the commandments], since that is its natural state.</p>
<p>Now there are thirty-six sins<sup><xref rid="fn1662">478</xref></sup> for which the Torah prescribed excision as a punishment, many of them being in connection with prohibitions of forbidden sexual relationships, that is to say, forbidden sexual intercourse. Similarly, punishments of death imposed by the court for forbidden sexual intercourse, are sixteen.<sup><xref rid="fn1663">479</xref></sup> But there is no death penalty at all for eating forbidden foods. The reason why these great punishments, such as death by the court and excision [by Heaven] are [imposed] for forbidden sexual relationships, is because immorality is something very abhorrent to the Torah, as is mentioned in this section and in many places of Scripture. The Sages always mention<sup><xref rid="fn1664">480</xref></sup> &#x201C;idolatry, immorality, and bloodshed&#x201D; [as being the three gravest sins], mentioning immorality after idolatry and before bloodshed [thus showing the greatness of the sin, in that it is mentioned immediately after idolatry]. This is like that which the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1665">481</xref></sup> &#x201C;The G-d of these people [i.e., the Israelites] abhors lewdness.&#x201D; There is also one of the great secrets of creation in this matter.<sup><xref rid="fn1666">482</xref></sup> And the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim:<sup><xref rid="fn1667">483</xref></sup> &#x201C;Because man&#x2019;s temptation to sexual intercourse is great, and because of the strong [natural] desire for it, which can cause many stumblings, a great punishment was needed in order to discipline people.&#x201D; This also is true.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1185">(1) Above, 10:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1186">(2) Ramban&#x2019;s intent is thus to explain that we should not think that this section was made known to Moses immediately after the death of Aaron&#x2019;s two sons, since the prohibition conveyed to Aaron against the ministering priests&#x2019; drinking wine, preceded it. The reason why Ramban finds this important to emphasize will be made clear further on. See Note 5.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1188">(4) Above, 10:8. Thus it must have been on the day after the day of the tragedy, when he was no longer a mourner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1189">(5) We may now understand why Ramban emphasized that the phrase <italic>after the death of the two sons of Aaron</italic> does not mean immediately after their death, since it was preceded by G-d&#x2019;s command to Aaron. For had the phrase meant &#x201C;immediately following their death,&#x201D; then it would have been possible that this command came to Moses on the day of the death of Aaron&#x2019;s sons. But now that the Divine command to Aaron preceded it, and that could not have taken place on the day of the tragedy [for the reason explained in the text], but only on the following day, it follows that the Divine command given to Moses, as contained in this section, was also communicated to him on the day after the death of Aaron&#x2019;s sons. Ramban&#x2019;s stressing of this is obviously intended to take exception to what Chizkuni clearly writes in his commentary, that it was on the selfsame day that the death occurred that the command contained in this section was communicated. On this Ramban commented: &#x201C;The holy spirit does not rest upon man in moments of sadness.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1195">(11) Thus the expression <italic>after the death</italic> is not a chronological note marking the occasion when this communication was given, but constitutes part of the Divine words, as if to say: &#x201C;Now that the death of Aaron&#x2019;s sons happened because they drew near etc., therefore speak to Aaron etc.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1196">(12) I.e., the Holy of Holies. This explains, according to Ibn Ezra, why He mentioned here the death of Aaron&#x2019;s sons, and then followed it up with the admonition against the priests entering at all times <italic>into the holy place within the Veil</italic> (M&#x2019;kor Chayim).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1202">(18) Further, Verses 12-13. According to tradition the High Priest first entered the Holy of Holies, and then put the incense upon the censer containing the coals of fire from the altar that stood in the outside Court. This Service, as will be explained further on, was done only on the Day of Atonement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1203">(19) Verse 13. Thus it will be shown that it is not the incense which brings death, for here Aaron went into the Sanctuary even further than his sons did, and he was protected by the incense. People will thus conclude that it is sin that brings death, and not the incense. This is clearly the trend of Ramban&#x2019;s thought.</ftnote>

The word <italic>terumah</italic> is here understood in the wider sense of &#x201C;something set apart.&#x201D; The portion given to the priest from the produce of the corn, etc. is therefore <italic>terumah</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn1221">(37) These explanations are found mostly on the Scriptural verses mentioned above, and the meaning of those left unexplained can be surmized from those explained (Kur Zahav).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1222">(38) Rashi thus interprets the verse to mean: &#x201C;he shall put on the linen tunic of the Sanctuary.&#x201D; Ramban will later suggest that by way of the simple meaning of Scripture, the phrase means that &#x201C;he shall put on &#x2018;the holy&#x2019; linen tunic.&#x201D; It is so rendered in the J.P.S. translation.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1239">(55) As it is stated in the verse before us: <italic>one lot for the Eternal, and the other for Azazel</italic>, and in the following verse it is stated that <italic>the goat upon which the lot fell for the Eternal</italic> be offered <italic>for a sin-offering</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1240">(56) I.e., &#x201C;it was unlike all other offerings&#x201D; (Ohel Yoseph).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1241">(57) In Verse 10 it states <italic>&#x2018;la&#x2019;azazel hamidbarah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>for Azazel into the wilderness</italic>). The secret is thus that this is the desert&#x2019;s portion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1242">(58) &#x201C;For the name [Azazel] is derived from the word <italic>az</italic> (strong), which is indicative of the nature of the offering befitting him, and of the strength and might which are in his power&#x201D; (Peirush Mototh on Ibn Ezra).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1243">(59) I.e., in the purification of the leper (above, 14:7) and of a house afflicted by leprosy (<italic>ibid.</italic>, Verse 53). See Ramban <italic>ibid.</italic>, Verse 53.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1244">(60) This enigmatic text in Ibn Ezra is generally explained by his commentators [and is so clearly indicated further, by Ramban] as follows: If from the word Azazel [here in Verse 8] you will count ahead thirty-three verses, you will reach Chapter 17, Verse 7, which reads <italic>And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs, after whom they go astray</italic>. Here then is the secret of why the goat that was sent away to Azazel was not slaughtered, so that it should not appear as a form of sacrifice to the satyrs (Ohel Yoseph). See my Hebrew commentary, p. 88.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1245">(61) Proverbs 11:13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1246">(62) The above verse reads: <italic>He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets; but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter</italic>. Ramban thus after paying tribute to Ibn Ezra for remaining faithful to the spirit of the second half of the verse, now says that nor will he himself be in violation of the first half of the verse, since the Sages have already revealed that secret in many places.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1247">(63) Bereshith Rabbah 65:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1248">(64) Literally: &#x201C;the goat.&#x201D; But this Hebrew term <italic>sa&#x2019;ir</italic> was also used by Scripture with reference to Esau [as the text continues], in the sense of &#x201C;hairy.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1249">(65) Verse 22.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1252">(68) Pirkei d&#x2019;Rabbi Eliezer, Chapter 46.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1253">(69) This is in connection with what is told in the Pirkei d&#x2019;Rabbi Eliezer, that &#x201C;on the day the Torah was given to Israel, Satan said before the Holy One, blessed be He: &#x2018;Master of the universe, you have given me control over all the wicked, but over the righteous You have not given me control&#x0021;&#x2019; To this the Holy One, blessed be He, replied: &#x2018;You will have control over them on the Day of Atonement if they have sinned, and if not, you will have no control over them.&#x2019;&#x201D; Therefore etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1254">(70) In view of the fact that the goat for the Eternal was offered as a sin-offering [as stated in Verse 9]. Rabbi David Luria in his commentary to the Pirkei d&#x2019;Rabbi Eliezer, emends the text to read: &#x201C;the lot of the Holy One, blessed be He, to be <italic>a sin-offering</italic>.&#x201D; It would seem, however, that Ramban calls it a &#x201C;burnt-offering&#x201D; because although it was technically <italic>a sin-offering</italic>, it was completely burnt as is a burnt-offering (further, Verse 27) and not eaten as is a sin-offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1255">(71) Verse 22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1256">(72) This would seem to be a reference to the Sanctuary, where the Service on the Day of Atonement lasted continuously for almost the whole day, and since it was not permitted to sit in the Sanctuary Court, the people who were there had to stand on their feet the whole day (Rabbi David Luria). Based on this text the custom has spread among devout Jews to stand on their feet during the whole Day of Atonement (see Shulchan Aruch, <italic>Orach Chayim</italic> 619:5).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1257">(73) Verse 33.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1258">(74) Ezekiel 16:18-19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1259">(75) According to the Masorah we read in the above first verse: <italic>nathat</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;thou&#x2019; didst set Mine oil</italic> &#x2026;), but the Hebrew word is actually written with a letter <italic>yod</italic> at the end, which suggests the reading <italic>nathati</italic>, meaning: &#x201C;and &#x2018;I&#x2019; did set Mine oil and Mine incense before them for your sake; that is to say, the offering which you brought before Me, it is I who gave it to them,&#x201D; (Abusuala), as will be explained further on in the text. The same applies to the following verse where the Hebrew word is read <italic>unethatha</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;thou&#x2019; didst even set it</italic>), but it is actually written with a letter <italic>yod: unethati</italic>, meaning, &#x201C;and I did set it &#x2026;&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1261">(77) Genesis 27:11. Numbers 24:18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1262">(78) Sanhedrin 60 b: &#x201C;He who makes a vow in the name of an idol, transgresses a negative commandment,&#x201D; i.e., <italic>and make no mention of the name of other gods</italic> (Exodus 23:13, Rashi). Ramban&#x2019;s thought is thus clear. If the priest were to dedicate the two goats by word of mouth, without the casting of lots, that would be as if he was worshipping Azazel, a deed which is punishable by death, and in addition it would be making a vow in the name of an idol, which is also prohibited under penalty of whipping. In either case, then, he would be doing something which the Torah has prohibited.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1280">(96) The attitude of these philosophers, who claimed that whatever their minds could not understand was untrue, was especially obnoxious to Ramban. History has fully borne him out on this matter, for there are literally myriads of matters which the Medieval scholastics, conditioned as they were by Aristotelian concepts of the universe, considered impossible, and are now proven facts. And who can foretell the future of our present-day concepts of the universe? There are obviously facts which lie beyond the present-day grasp of the human mind, which will some day become firmly established. To deny their possibility just because we do not understand them, was to Ramban a manifestation of arrogance.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1286">(102) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Acharei</italic> 4:1-2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1287">(103) In relation to the Holy of Holies which is called &#x201C;within,&#x201D; the space in front of the Veil is called &#x201C;outside.&#x201D; But it is in fact within the Sanctuary. Opposite the Veil, towards the entrance of the Sanctuary, stood the inner [or golden] altar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1288">(104) But had they constituted one act of atonement, then even if the blood was poured away before he completed the applications on the altar, he would have to start again from the applications within the Holy of Holies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1289">(105) See Ramban above, Verse 8 [in connection with the quote from the Pirkei d&#x2019;Rabbi Eliezer about Sammael]. The particular expression of Ramban here is based upon a Rabbinic tradition (Shabbath 119 b) that two ministering angels, one good and one bad, accompany a person on the eve of the Sabbath on his way from the synagogue to his home. If the house is in order, the light is kindled, and peace reigns throughout, the good angel says, &#x201C;May it be so on the next Sabbath as well,&#x201D; and the bad angel answers &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; against his will, etc.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1291">(107) Verse 22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1292">(108) A thread of crimson wool was tied on the head of the goat as soon as the lot determined that it was to be sent to Azazel (Yoma 41 b). When the person who brought it there finally arrived at the ravine, he divided the threat and tied one half to the rock and the other half between the horns of the goat (<italic>ibid.</italic>, 67a). There was also a thread of crimson wool tied to the door of the Sanctuary (<italic>ibid.</italic>, 68 b). At the moment of the fulfillment of the Divine command concerning this goat, the threads miraculously turned white as a sign of the Divine forgiveness, as it is said, <italic>though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow</italic> (Isaiah 1:18) (Yoma 68 b).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1295">(111) So I have found in all editions of Rashi, including the first Reggio (1475) edition. But obviously the procedure was that he first removed the garments, and then immersed himself. The washing of hands and feet according to the Sages also took place before the removal of the garments (Yoma 31 b).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1296">(112) Numbers 28:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1297">(113) The verse as stated reads: <italic>And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall put off the linen garments &#x2026; and shall leave them there</italic>. Under no circumstances, as Ramban points out, can this be taken literally. It must then mean etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1298">(114) Verse 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1299">(115) Verse 24.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1309">(125) Yoma 70 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1310">(126) Thus the text indicates that the slaughtering of the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon had already taken place, for if not, the Mishnah would have stated: &#x201C;and they brought him the golden garments &#x2026; and he went out and offered the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon, and then he went into the Sanctuary to burn the incense etc.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1311">(127) Since this special Service followed that of the ordinary Daily burnt-offering of the morning, which was performed in the golden garments, and was also preceded by the priest immersing himself in a ritual pool, it followed that his attiring himself in the white garments to perform the special Service for the Day of Atonement was after his <italic>second</italic> immersion. This is important to note in order to understand the text which follows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1312">(128) Verse 25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1313">(129) Above, 6:13-15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1314">(130) Such was the law taught to Moses on Sinai, that &#x201C;on this day [i.e., the Day of Atonement] the High Priest immerses himself <italic>five</italic> times and washes his hands and feet <italic>ten</italic> times&#x201D; as he changes from one set of garments to another in the performance of the various rites of the day (Yoma 32 a, Rashi). Rashi&#x2019;s statement here on the verse before us that &#x201C;this is not its proper place&#x201D; is thus to be understood as follows: Since Scripture wanted to complete in one section everything that was to be done in the white garments during the whole day, as is its custom everywhere to finish a subject that it began, although there may be some minor matters which are mentioned afterwards but really took place before the conclusion of that subject, it therefore purposely stated it here, although the actual performance thereof took place at a later point in the Service of the Day of Atonement, as is explained in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1315">(131) The performer of the deed is thus implied in the verse, even though he is not specifically mentioned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1316">(132) According to the Keseph Mezukak, the reading should be: &#x201C;the bullock and the goats.&#x201D; See further in my Hebrew commentary, p. 93.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1317">(133) Verse 28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1318">(134) See above in <italic>Seder Vayikra</italic>, Note 277.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1319">(135) See a similar expression in Ramban above, 3:9 (towards end, at Note 277). Here, however, the Hebrew expression <italic>m&#x2019;chukei sheim</italic> may mean: &#x201C;those whose names are blotted out&#x201D; from the ranks of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1320">(136) Josiah did this in order to prevent the desecration of the sacred oil by the hands of the enemy when Israel was to go into exile (Horayoth 12 a). The ark of the covenant was also hidden at that time (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1321">(137) Horayoth 13 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1322">(138) It is thus clear that both kinds of High Priest can exist simultaneously.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1323">(139) Makkoth 11 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1324">(140) Numbers 35:25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1325">(141) &#x201C;Lest aught befall the High Priest to render him ineligible&#x201D; (Yoma 2 a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1326">(142) See my Hebrew commentary p. 93 for various reasons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1327">(143) Ramban is now to explain why this chapter [dealing with the prohibition of slaughtering any of the holy offerings outside the Sanctuary Court], is addressed to both the priests and all the children of Israel, which is an unusual form of address in the Scriptural laws.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1328">(144) Chullin 16 b. This is the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1329">(145) Literally: &#x201C;meat eaten out of desire to satisfy the appetite.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1330">(146) Verse 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1331">(147) Verse 4: <italic>and that man will be cut off from among his people</italic>. See Ramban further, 18:29 for the specific meaning of this form of punishment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1332">(148) Verse 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1333">(149) See above in <italic>Seder Shemini</italic>, Note 122 for full explanation of this term.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1334">(150) Verse 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1335">(151) I.e., originally brought as unconsecrated. When it is slaughtered in the Sanctuary Court as a peace-offering, it has naturally already become consecrated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1336">(152) Deuteronomy 12:10-11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1337">(153) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verses 13-14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1338">(154) Thus as long as the Tabernacle was at Shiloh, it was prohibited to bring offerings elsewhere. After its destruction by the Philistines, the <italic>bamoth</italic> were permitted. After the House of G-d was finally established in Jerusalem, the <italic>bamoth</italic> were again forbidden and never again permitted (Zebachim 112 b).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1339">(155) Deuteronomy 12:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1340">(156) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1341">(157) Devarim Rabbah 4:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1342">(158) The meaning of course is obvious, that under a different set of circumstances He permitted those matters which He had prohibited elsewhere. The case before us is the perfect example, as the text continues.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1343">(159) Verse 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1344">(160) Rabbi Akiba (Chullin 17 a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1345">(161) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Acharei</italic>, Chapters 6, and 9-10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1346">(162) This is a reference to the text from Devarim Rabbah quoted above, which bears out fully Ramban&#x2019;s explanation that when Israel was in the desert, an ordinary meal of meat was prohibited to them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1347">(163) Ramban means to say that while it is true that the Torath Kohanim is like Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation, yet most Rabbinic sources accept Rabbi Yishmael&#x2019;s opinion, as presented by Ramban.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1348">(164) Ramban&#x2019;s intention is as follows. At the time of Creation the slaughtering of any living creature as food was forbidden (see Ramban on Genesis 1:29, Vol. I, pp. 56-58). Only after the flood was the killing of animals permitted (<italic>ibid.</italic>, 9:5, pp. 134-135). Hence the meaning of the verse here is that if one slaughters an animal outside the camp, then since it is forbidden to him as food, it shall be imputed to him as if he is guilty of bloodshed &#x201C;as at the time of Creation.&#x201D; See also Ramban here on Verse 11.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1353">(169) Above, 16:8 [beginning with the paragraph: &#x201C;And this is the secret of the matter. They used to worship etc.&#x201D;].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1354">(170) Fire, water, earth, and air. See Vol. I, p. 26. These basic elements were first created by G-d, and out of a combination of them. He made man, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1355">(171) Sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1356">(172) See Ramban on Genesis 2:17, Vol. I, p. 75.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1357">(173) Chagigah 16 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1358">(174) Ramban now begins to explain the text quoted on the basis of certain scientific concepts that were prevalent in his times. A prefatory word is in place. The serious student will not look upon these concepts with an eye for criticism. The theory that the whole physical world is founded upon various combinations of four elements, was an Aristotelian legacy which ruled man&#x2019;s minds for a millenium. The extension of that theory into the elusive world of the spirit was logical. That scientists today have moved to other theories to explain the universe and the various phenomena of life, has no bearing upon the explanations which were accepted in the past, for who can foretell what knowledge will do to &#x201C;the established truths&#x201D; of today? The important thing in Ramban&#x2019;s presentation of this whole obstruse subject is his final conclusion that only G-d in His Providence exercises power over man&#x2019;s destiny.</ftnote>

Thus <italic>Elokim</italic> means &#x201C;the Force of all forces.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1368">(184) Above, 3:17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1369">(185) See Ramban above, 3:9, that even in the same animal the prohibited fat is distinguishable from the permitted fat. So also are the fats of a permitted fowl and wild beast [which are permitted to be eaten] distinguishable from those fats of a permitted animal that may not be eaten. This is not so in the case of blood; hence He prohibited all blood, even that of fowls and wild animals which are not offered upon the altar.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1380">(196) Ecclesiastes 3:19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1381">(197) A concept of great significance in Medieval philosophy, the Active Intellect denoted an incorporeal substance, the role of which was to make the forms of the imagination &#x201C;actual&#x201D; objects of the intellect, after they have been only &#x201C;potential&#x201D; objects of the intellect. Yehudah Halevi in his &#x201C;Al Khazari,&#x201D; when presenting the view of the philosophers, writes of it: &#x201C;This is the degree of the Active Intellect, namely, that angel whose degree is below the angel who is connected with the sphere of the moon&#x201D; (p. 37). It is out of that Active Intellect that the animal soul originated.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1388">(204) See Ramban above, Verse 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1389">(205) From the language of Rashi it would appear that the substance of the blood is identical with the life of the animal, and that is not correct in Ramban&#x2019;s opinion, since they are really two separate substances, and the blood of the animal is merely the &#x201C;carrier&#x201D; of its life. Hence Ramban will present other interpretations of the verse.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1393">(209) Verse 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1394">(210) The sense here is clearly &#x201C;the force of the heart beat&#x201D; pumping the blood. In Medieval learning it was explained as the element of air which originates in the heart, and which in turn supplies the blood and sustains the person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1395">(211) A Greek term indicating the primary matter created by G-d (see Vol. I, p. 23), and here used in a wider sense as the force in the heart which is the primary organ of life.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1402">(218) See II Samuel 23:2.

<ftnote id="fn1432">(248) The Talmud and Midrashim abound in instances which prove that Elijah&#x2019;s removal from earth was no interruption of his earthly existence. On the contrary, in countless appearances he traverses the world in order to protect the innocent etc. (see L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, IV, pp. 202-235).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1433">(249) Genesis 5:24: <italic>And Enoch walked with G-d, and he was not; for G-d took him</italic>. Many Midrashim describe his activity after his ascencion into heaven. See, however, Rashi <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1438">(254) &#x201C;For as a rule, the mother of the wife, her grandmother, daughter, granddaughter, and sister-in-law are often with her; the husband meets them always when he goes out, when he comes in, and when he is at his work&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>, Friedlander&#x2019;s translation). Now &#x201C;if we were allowed to marry any of them, and were only precluded from sexual intercourse with them without marriage, most people would constantly become guilty of misconduct with them. But as they are entirely forbidden to us &#x2026; there is reason to expect that people will not seek it, and will not think of it&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1439">(255) In the verse before us.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1442">(258) Genesis 38:8 (Vol. I, pp. 469-470).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1443">(259) Further, 29:19. See Ramban on Exodus 21:9 (Vol. II, pp. 356-7), where he elaborates on the meaning of this word <italic>sh&#x2019;eir</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1444">(260) Isaiah 4:3. The term <italic>sh&#x2019;eir</italic> denoting &#x201C;flesh&#x201D; or &#x201C;relative&#x201D; is something which &#x201C;remains&#x201D; with a person, as it is his own or next to his flesh.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1446">(262) Verse 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1447">(263) Verse 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1448">(264) Sanhedrin 54 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1449">(265) If the sin were committed knowingly, there would be no point in saying that &#x201C;a double penalty is incurred,&#x201D; since the punishment for either of these two sins is death by stoning, and death cannot be inflicted more than once. Hence &#x201C;the double penalty&#x201D; must be where he committed it unwittingly, in which case he must bring two sin-offerings. See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. II, pp. 315-317.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1450">(266) Verses 15-16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1451">(267) Hence the verse before us, <italic>the nakedness of thy father and the nakedness of thy mother</italic> does not constitute two separate prohibitions as Rashi explained it [one referring to one&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s wife, and one to one&#x2019;s own mother although she is not the wife of one&#x2019;s father, as stated above], but they are one prohibition, as explained further on in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1452">(268) Verse 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1453">(269) Verse 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1454">(270) I.e., if his mother had sexual relationships with one of the forbidden <italic>relations</italic>, the penalty for which is excision [and not mere whipping], it would follow that the child born from that union is not included under the terms of this prohibition; since by stating these two examples &#x2014; that the mother was either a <italic>mamzereth</italic> or a <italic>nethinah</italic>, with whom, in both of which cases, sexual intercourse is punishable only with whipping &#x2014; Rashi thereby seems to exclude from this verse the case where the mother was one of the forbidden <italic>relations</italic>, where the penalty is excision&#x0021; This conclusion is obviously incorrect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1455">(271) Yebamoth 23 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1456">(272) Deuteronomy 21:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1457">(273) The word <italic>thihyena</italic> is a word indicating legal status of marriage. Thus you must say that in the case of a marriage which is &#x201C;hated&#x201D; because it is punishable merely by whipping, [as in the case of a man marrying a <italic>mamzereth</italic>], the act of betrothal <italic>does</italic> take effect, and the daughter born from such a union is considered one&#x2019;s &#x201C;sister&#x201D; with respect to the prohibition before us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1458">(274) Since Verse 9 before us begins, <italic>The nakedness of &#x2018;thy sister,&#x2019;</italic> and yet goes on to mention the one <italic>&#x2018;born abroad,&#x2019;</italic> it is clear that even a daughter born of a union which is punishable by excision [as explained further on], is a &#x201C;sister&#x201D; with respect to this prohibition.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1459">(275) It is thus clear that even if the mother were one of those forbidden relations to his father with whom sexual intercourse is punishable by excision, the daughter born is still forbidden as a &#x201C;sister.&#x201D; This does not appear to be so from the language of Rashi before us, who singled out cases of marriages forbidden only by whipping, in which cases the betrothal is valid&#x0021; See above, Note 270.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1482">(298) See my Hebrew commentary p. 104, that Rabbeinu Bachya questioned this attitude of Ramban. It would also appear from Ramban&#x2019;s quote of Ibn Ezra further on in Verse 20, that the purpose of sexual intercourse is threefold, and the raising of children is only one purpose. Hence Ramban&#x2019;s statement here must be understood in the sense that the &#x201C;principal&#x201D; purpose thereof is the raising of children.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1490">(306) For no amount of washing the body can take the place of ritual immersion, where such is prescribed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1491">(307) This is obviously a reference to what Rambam wrote in his Mishneh Torah at the end of <italic>Hilchoth Mikvaoth</italic>, on the significance of immersion, that it is not merely a matter of removing mud or dirt which may be removed by water, but &#x201C;it is a Scriptural decree, the validity of the act depending upon the disposition of the heart. It is for this reason that the Sages have said. &#x2018;If he immersed himself without intention, it is as though he had not immersed himself at all&#x2019; (Chagigah 18 b) &#x2026; Thus he whose heart intends to purify himself, becomes purified as soon as the [actual] immersion is accomplished.&#x201D; It is clear, then, that since both body and soul must participate in the act of immersion, the effect and potency of the purification applies to both body and soul as Ramban here states, &#x201C;for then she will be purified also in her thoughts, and become completely clean.&#x201D; See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, pp. 117-119.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1495">(311) Further, 20:10: <italic>And the man that committeth adultery with another man&#x2019;s wife &#x2026; both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1496">(312) Numbers 5:13. The Hebrew <italic>shichvath zera</italic> literally means &#x201C;a lying of seed.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1497">(313) Literally: &#x201C;seed.&#x201D; In the light of what Ramban has written above, it may also mean that his jealousy is aroused on account of his children, whose legitimacy will henceforth be questioned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1498">(314) Further, 19:20. Here too the term used is <italic>shichvath zera</italic>, which literally means &#x201C;a lying of seed.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1499">(315) Kerithoth 11 a.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1502">(318) Verse 19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1503">(319) Further, 20:19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1504">(320) I.e., to let any of them pass through [the fire] to Molech. The implications will be fully discussed in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1505">(321) Since the prefix <italic>lamed</italic> [in the word <italic>lamolech</italic>] is vowelled with a <italic>pathach</italic> [instead of with a <italic>shva</italic> which would have made it <italic>l&#x2019;molech</italic>], it is quite clear that it is speaking of an idol that is known. See Ramban on Exodus 22:19. (Vol. II, p. 390) quoting Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1506">(322) I Kings 11:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1507">(323) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 7. Milcom of Verse 5, is thus identical with Molech of Verse 7. Hence the idol by the name of Molech mentioned here in the Torah appears to be, as Ibn Ezra wrote, <italic>Milcom the detestation of the Ammonites</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1508">(324) Ramban&#x2019;s intention is to forestall the following question: If, as we have said, Molech is the same as Milcom, why does Scripture call Milcom <italic>the detestation of the children of Ammon</italic>, when from the text here before us in the Torah it is plain that they knew the idol already from Egypt [as is explained in the text above]? To this question Ramban answers that it was also known to them by the name &#x201C;Milcom&#x201D; [in the time of Solomon]. Hence Scripture used that name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1509">(325) Sanhedrin 64 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1510">(326) &#x201C;Like children leaping over a bonfire&#x201D; (Rashi <italic>ibid.</italic>). The Talmudic text <italic>k&#x2019;mishvarto d&#x2019;puria</italic> is thus explained by Rashi &#x201C;as a leaping place of Purim,&#x201D; i.e., like a bonfire made on Purim for merriment, over which children leap. Ramban will later on explain that at the Molech the child was passed through the flames so many times that the flames actually burnt him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1511">(327) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 64 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1512">(328) The Gemara speaks there of a case where &#x201C;he made all his offspring pass through the fire&#x201D; &#x2014; an expression which indicates that it is the father himself who makes them pass through the fire.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1513">(329) In other words, if, as Rashi said, it is the priests who perform the rite of passing the child through the fire, it is they who do the forbidden act of worship and not the father. So how could he be made liable to punishment for the act of other people? The mere handing over of the child to the priests is not in itself an act of worship.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1525">(341) II Chronicles 28:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1526">(342) Ramban is thus suggesting that the word <italic>ha&#x2019;avarah</italic> (&#x201C;passing through&#x201D;) was really an <italic>hav&#x2019;arah</italic> (an actual burning of fire), since the verse in Kings speaking of King Ahaz uses the term <italic>ha&#x2019;avarah</italic>, while the verse in Chronicles describing the same acts of the same king uses the term <italic>hav&#x2019;arah</italic>. Thus it is clear that the two words are identical in meaning in this context.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1532">(348) Numbers 25:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1533">(349) II Kings 1:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1534">(350) In Sanhedrin 63 b the Talmud explains the word to mean &#x201C;the mule.&#x201D; The word <italic>adar</italic> in Aramaic means &#x201C;distinction,&#x201D; and the mule is so called because it gives distinction to its owner when travelling, because it carries all his belongings. The name Adrammelech thus means &#x201C;The mule is the king,&#x201D; or &#x201C;the animal which gives distinction to the king.&#x201D; See II Samuel 13:29, that the mule was ridden by princes, and I Kings 1:33 that it was ridden by the king. Ramban in explaining Adrammelech to be identical with Molech, thus suggests that the Sepharvites called their idol Adar, a name meaning &#x201C;distinction,&#x201D; and Adrammelech is &#x201C;the king of distinction.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1535">(351) This term according to the Talmud (Sanhedrin <italic>ibid.</italic>) is a reference to the horse because it &#x201C;answers&#x201D; its master when engaged in battle. See my Hebrew commentary p. 107, Note 44. The name Anammelech means &#x201C;The horse is the king,&#x201D; or &#x201C;the animal which answers the king&#x201D; in battle. Ramban here suggests, then, that Molech was called Anammelech because &#x201C;he is the king who answers.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1536">(352) Sanhedrin 63 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1537">(353) &#x201C;With the oil of&#x201D; &#x2014; this phrase is not mentioned in the Gemara. It is evidently Ramban&#x2019;s comment as to how it was done. Rashi, however writes that the application was done with the blood of the salamander (see following note).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1538">(354) &#x201C;A small reptile engendered in a fire that has burnt continually for seven years, and he who covers himself with its blood becomes fire-proof&#x201D; (Rashi <italic>ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1539">(355) Evidently the reference is to certain commentators. But I have not identified these.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1540">(356) Deuteronomy 18:10. The fact that all these practices are mentioned together proves that the rite of &#x201C;passing through the fire&#x201D; was also some form of witchcraft, while the actual burning of the victim was an entirely different matter, since that was a form of idol worship to Molech. All this we would say according to the plain meaning of Scripture. But see further, Note 359.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1541">(357) II Chronicles 33:6. Here too the same reasoning as in the previous note applies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1542">(358) II Kings 17:17. Here likewise it would seem that &#x201C;passing through the fire&#x201D; was a form of witchcraft, something different from the worship of Molech. But see the following note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1543">(359) Accordingly, in line with the plain meaning of Scripture we would say that the rite of &#x201C;passing through the fire&#x201D; was something different from the burning of the victim to Molech. But since we have found it written etc. (see text).</ftnote>

This hints at the first <italic>ha&#x2019;aretz</italic>, mentioned in the first verse of Creation, which Ramban has already explained in many places as referring to &#x201C;the higher earth,&#x201D; to which the souls finally return after their sojourn on the lower earth.</ftnote>

<h1>19</h1>
<p>2. SPEAK UNTO ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. Our Rabbis have already said<sup><xref rid="fn1668">1</xref></sup> that this section was addressed to the full assembly [of all Israel] because most of the fundamental principles of the Torah are dependent on it,<sup><xref rid="fn1669">2</xref></sup> this being the reason for the expression, <italic>speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel</italic>. This section, however, was mentioned here in [the book of] <italic>Torath Kohanim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1670">3</xref></sup> because it contains laws concerning the thanks-offering,<sup><xref rid="fn1671">4</xref></sup> and also because it states the punishments<sup><xref rid="fn1672">5</xref></sup> He commanded us to execute on those who do the abominable deeds mentioned [in the preceding sections], as well as [those for] the forbidden sexual relationships. These subjects have been included in this book [of <italic>Torath Kohanim</italic>] for the reason that we have written at the beginning of this book.<sup><xref rid="fn1673">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>YE SHALL BE HOLY. &#x201C;Abstain from the forbidden sexual relationships [mentioned in the preceding section] and from [other] sin,<sup><xref rid="fn1674">7</xref></sup> because wherever you find [in the Torah] a warning to guard against immorality, you find the mention of &#x2018;holiness.&#x2019;&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But in the Torath Kohanim I have seen it mentioned without any qualification [i.e., without any particular reference to immorality, as Rashi expressed it], saying:<sup><xref rid="fn1675">8</xref></sup> &#x201C;Be self-restraining.&#x201D; Similarly, the Rabbis taught there:<sup><xref rid="fn1676">9</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And ye shall sanctify yourselves, and be ye holy, for I am Holy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1677">10</xref></sup> Just as I am Holy, so be you holy. Just as I am Pure, so be you pure.&#x201D; And in my opinion, this abstinence does not refer only to restraint from acts of immorality, as the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote, but it is rather the self-control mentioned throughout the Talmud, which confers upon those who practice it the name of <italic>P&#x2019;rushim</italic> (Pharisees), [literally: &#x201C;those who are separated&#x201D; from self-indulgence, as will be explained, or those who practice self-restraint]. The meaning thereof is as follows: The Torah has admonished us against immorality and forbidden foods, but permitted sexual intercourse between man and his wife, and the eating of [certain] meat and wine. If so, a man of desire could consider this to be a permission to be passionately addicted to sexual intercourse with his wife or many wives, and be <italic>among winebibbers, among gluttonous eaters of flesh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1678">11</xref></sup> and speak freely all profanities, since this prohibition has not been [expressly] mentioned in the Torah, and thus he will become a sordid person within the permissible realm of the Torah&#x0021; Therefore, after having listed the matters which He prohibited altogether, Scripture followed them up by a general command that we practice moderation even in matters which are permitted, [such as in the following]: One should minimize sexual intercourse, similar to that which the Rabbis have said,<sup><xref rid="fn1679">12</xref></sup> &#x201C;So that the disciples of the Sages should not be found together with their wives as often as the hens,&#x201D; and he should not engage in it except as required in fulfillment of the commandment thereof. He should also sanctify himself [to self-restraint] by using wine in small amounts, just as Scripture calls a Nazirite &#x201C;holy&#x201D; [for abstaining from wine and strong drink],<sup><xref rid="fn1680">13</xref></sup> and he should remember the evils which the Torah mentioned as following from [drinking wine] in the cases of Noah<sup><xref rid="fn1681">14</xref></sup> and Lot.<sup><xref rid="fn1682">15</xref></sup> Similarly, he should keep himself away from impurity [in his ordinary daily activity], even though we have not been admonished against it in the Torah, similar to that which the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1683">16</xref></sup> &#x201C;For the <italic>P&#x2019;rushim</italic> (Pharisees), the clothes of the unlearned are considered as if trodden upon by a <italic>zav</italic>&#x201D; [or <italic>zavah</italic> &#x2014; a man or woman having suffered a flux], and just as the Nazirite is called &#x201C;holy&#x201D; because of guarding himself from the impurity of the dead.<sup><xref rid="fn1684">17</xref></sup> Likewise he should guard his mouth and tongue from being defiled by excessive food and by lewd talk, similar to what Scripture states, <italic>and every mouth speaketh wantonness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1685">18</xref></sup> and he should purify himself in this respect until he reaches the degree known as [complete] &#x201C;self-restraint,&#x201D; as the Rabbis said concerning Rabbi Chiya,<sup><xref rid="fn1686">19</xref></sup> that never in his life did he engage in unnecessary talk. It is with reference to these and similar matters that this general commandment [<italic>Ye shall be holy</italic>] is concerned, after He had enumerated all individual deeds which are strictly forbidden, so that cleanliness of hands and body, are also included in this precept, just like the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1687">20</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And ye shall sanctify yourselves</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1677">10</xref></sup> This refers to the washing of hands before meals. <italic>And be ye holy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1677">10</xref></sup> This refers to the washing of hands after meals [before the reciting of grace]. <italic>For I am holy</italic> &#x2014; this alludes to the spiced oil&#x201D; [with which they used to rub their hands after a meal]. For although these [washings and perfuming of the hands] are commandments of Rabbinic origin, yet Scripture&#x2019;s main intention is to warn us of such matters, that we should be [physically] clean and [ritually] pure, and separated from the common people who soil themselves with luxuries and unseemly things. And such is the way of the Torah, that after it lists certain specific prohibitions, it includes them all in a general precept. Thus after warning with detailed laws regarding all business dealings between people, such as not to steal or rob or to wrong<sup><xref rid="fn1688">21</xref></sup> one another, and other similar prohibitions, He said in general, <italic>And thou shalt do that which is right and good</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1689">22</xref></sup> thus including under a positive commandment the duty of doing that which is right and of agreeing to a compromise [when not to do so would be inequitable]; as well as all requirements to act &#x201C;beyond&#x201D; the line of justice [i.e., to be generous in not insisting upon one&#x2019;s rights as defined by the strict letter of the law, but to agree to act &#x201C;beyond&#x201D; that line of the strict law] for the sake of pleasing one&#x2019;s fellowman, as I will explain when I reach there [that verse], with the will of the Holy One, blessed be He. Similarly in the case of the Sabbath, He prohibited doing certain classes of work by means of a negative commandment,<sup><xref rid="fn1690">23</xref></sup> and painstaking labors [not categorized as &#x201C;work,&#x201D; such as transferring heavy loads in one&#x2019;s yard from one place to another, etc.] He included under a general positive commandment, as it is said, <italic>but on the seventh day thou shalt rest</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1691">24</xref></sup> I will yet explain this<sup><xref rid="fn1692">25</xref></sup> with the help of G-d.</p>
<p>FOR I THE ETERNAL YOUR G-D AM HOLY. This means to say that we will merit to cleave unto Him by being holy. This expression [<italic>I the Eternal your G-d</italic>] is similar to that of the first commandment in the Ten Commandments [which begins, <italic>I am the Eternal thy G-d</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1693">26</xref></sup> He commanded here, <italic>Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1694">27</xref></sup> for there [in the Ten Commandments] He commanded that we honor them,<sup><xref rid="fn1695">28</xref></sup> and here it is about fearing them. And he states here, <italic>and ye shall keep My Sabbaths</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1694">27</xref></sup> for there [in the Ten Commandments] He commanded concerning remembering it,<sup><xref rid="fn1696">29</xref></sup> and here about keeping it. We have already explained the meaning of both terms.<sup><xref rid="fn1696">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>He states, <italic>&#x2018;Al tiphnu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>Turn ye not</italic>) <italic>unto the idols</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1697">30</xref></sup> the term <italic>tiphnu</italic> (turn ye) being of the expressions: <italic>and if thy heart &#x2018;yiphneh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>turn away</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn1698">31</xref></sup> <italic>whose heart &#x2018;poneh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>turneth away</italic>) <italic>this day</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1699">32</xref></sup> The verse [here] is thus stating that one&#x2019;s heart should not turn away to the idols, to believe that there is some benefit in [worshipping] them, or that the events that they foretell will really transpire; rather, they and all their activities should appear to him <italic>as things of nought, and vanity</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1700">33</xref></sup> and future events occur only by decree of the Most High. And so also have our Rabbis said:<sup><xref rid="fn1701">34</xref></sup> &#x201C;It is forbidden to look at the statues [of the idols] themselves, because it says, <italic>&#x2018;Turn ye not&#x2019; unto the idols</italic>.&#x201D; Thus the Rabbis included within this prohibition even looking at the statues, so that one should not allow one&#x2019;s thoughts to dwell on their matters at all.</p>
<p>He states, <italic>nor make to yourselves molten gods</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1697">30</xref></sup> thus prohibiting them from the very moment that they are made. Admonitions against idolatry are stated in the Torah in many places.</p>
<p>In the Midrash of Vayikra Rabbah the Rabbis mentioned concerning this section [of the Torah the following text]:<sup><xref rid="fn1702">35</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Levi says: Because the Ten Commandments are included in this section [therefore it was proclaimed to the full assembly]. <italic>I am the Eternal thy G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1693">26</xref></sup> and here it is written, <italic>I am the Eternal your G-d. Thou shalt have no other gods</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1703">36</xref></sup> and here it is written, <italic>nor make to yourselves molten gods</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1697">30</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Eternal thy G-d in vain</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1704">37</xref></sup> and here it is written, <italic>And ye shall not swear by My Name falsely</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1705">38</xref></sup> <italic>Remember the Sabbath day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1696">29</xref></sup> and here it is written, <italic>and ye shall keep My Sabbaths</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1694">27</xref></sup> <italic>Honor thy father and thy mother</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1695">28</xref></sup> and here it is written, <italic>Ye shall fear every man his mother and his father</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1694">27</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not murder</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1706">39</xref></sup> and here it is written, <italic>Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbor</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1707">40</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not commit adultery</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1706">39</xref></sup> and here it is written, <italic>Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1708">41</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not steal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1706">39</xref></sup> and here it is written, <italic>Ye shall not steal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1709">42</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not bear false witness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1706">39</xref></sup> and here it is written, <italic>Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1707">40</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not covet</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1710">43</xref></sup> and here it is written, <italic>and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1711">44</xref></sup> Thus far is the text of the Midrash.</p>
<p>He states, <italic>And when ye offer an offering of peace-offerings unto the Eternal</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn1712">45</xref></sup> for after He prohibited the slaughtering of sacrifices, and all manner of worship to idols and to molten gods, and ordered that all Services be devoted to the Proper Name [i.e., the Tetragrammaton] exclusively, He stated here that when you shall bring an offering to the Eternal, it shall be <italic>lirtzonchem</italic> [&#x201C;of your desire&#x201D;], in order that your worship should be acceptable to Him and that He should be pleased with you,<sup><xref rid="fn1713">46</xref></sup> even as a servant reconciles himself to his master<sup><xref rid="fn1714">47</xref></sup> by doing all that he commands him to do, the expression [<italic>lirtzonchem</italic>] being similar to: <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;nirtzah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and it shall be accepted</italic>) <italic>for him to make atonement for him;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1715">48</xref></sup> <italic>but by the light of Thy countenance, because &#x2018;retzitham&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>Thou wast favorable unto them</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1716">49</xref></sup> And the meaning of the verse is to state that you are not to think that there is any benefit in idol worship, neither are you to do the service of <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1717">50</xref></sup> in order to receive a reward, but only to do His Will, for it is His simple Will<sup><xref rid="fn1718">51</xref></sup> that is proper and incumbent upon us [to do]. He states this with reference to the peace-offerings because they are of the lesser degree of holy offerings, which are eaten by the owners themselves [unlike the most holy offerings, such as the sin-offering, which may be eaten only by the priests, the verse thus saying] that the owners are to guard their thoughts, so that the offerings be brought with the proper intention, and this applies all the more so to the most holy offerings. Or it may be that [the verse here mentions peace-offerings] because peace-offerings are the [unique] attribute of Israel, just as our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1719">52</xref></sup> &#x201C;Noachides did not offer peace-offerings.&#x201D; The student learned [in the mysteries of the Cabala] will understand. And our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1720">53</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Lirtzonchem</italic> [literally: &#x2018;to your intent&#x2019;] slaughter the offering, meaning that you are to have the intention to slaughter it,&#x201D; for if he merely &#x201C;handles&#x201D; an offering [i.e., if he does the act of slaughtering without the intention of so doing], he invalidates [the offering].</p>
<p>12. AND YE SHALL NOT SWEAR BY MY NAME FALSELY. &#x201C;Why is this stated [when it has already been mentioned in the Ten Commandments]? Since it is said, <italic>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Eternal thy G-d in vain</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1704">37</xref></sup> I might think that one is liable only if he swore by the Proper Name of G-d. Whence do I know to include all &#x2018;substitute&#x2019; Names of G-d [such as Merciful, etc.]? Scripture therefore says, <italic>And ye shall not swear &#x2018;bishmi&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>by My Name</italic>) <italic>falsely</italic> &#x2014; by any Name I have.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language from the Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn1721">54</xref></sup> By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], <italic>And ye shall not swear by My Name</italic> refers to the Proper Name [i.e., the Tetragrammaton]. <italic>And thereby thou wilt profane the Name of thy G-d</italic> refers to the Name <italic>Elokim</italic> (G-d), from which Name all other &#x201C;substitute&#x201D; Names of G-d are derived. And there [in the Ten Commandments] it says at first <italic>the Name of the Eternal thy G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1704">37</xref></sup> and similarly, <italic>the Eternal will not hold him guiltless</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1704">37</xref></sup> meaning, by His Great Proper Name. And this is the meaning of the expression [here in the verse before us], <italic>and thou wilt profane</italic>, meaning that he who swears falsely by the Proper Name, will thereby be profaning the Name of <italic>Elokim</italic> [as all Divine Names are united in perfect Unity].<sup><xref rid="fn1722">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. THOU SHALT NOT CURSE THE DEAF. &#x201C;From this verse I know only [that one may not curse] the deaf. Whence do I know that one may not curse anybody? From the words of Scripture: <italic>Of thy people thou shalt not curse</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1723">56</xref></sup> If so, why does it state [here] &#x2018;the deaf&#x2019;? It is to teach us that &#x2018;the deaf&#x2019; has been singled out by Scripture [here] because [although he is unable to hear and feel hurt], he has the characteristic of being alive, thus exluding [from the scope of this prohibition] the dead [who, though they are like the deaf in their inability to hear and feel hurt], are unlike them in being no longer alive.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, and so it is taught in the Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn1724">57</xref></sup> But the interpretation of the Gemara<sup><xref rid="fn1725">58</xref></sup> is not so. Rather, Scripture first warned against [cursing] the dignitaries of the people, the judge or ruler, saying, <italic>Thou shalt not curse &#x2018;elohim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the judges</italic>) <italic>nor curse a ruler of thy people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1723">56</xref></sup> Then it gave another admonition [here] against cursing the unfortunate ones of the people, like the deaf, and from them [i.e., from both classes of people, the distinguished and the unfortunate] we learn by a general proposition that we must not curse anyone of the rest of the people, since from beginning to end [from &#x201C;the ruler&#x201D; to &#x201C;the deaf&#x201D;] they are all included in this prohibition.<sup><xref rid="fn1726">59</xref></sup> And the word <italic>b&#x2019;amcha</italic> (of thy people &#x2014; <italic>a ruler &#x2018;of thy people&#x2019;</italic>) is interpreted [by the Gemara] to mean<sup><xref rid="fn1727">60</xref></sup> only those who conduct themselves in the manner <italic>of thy people</italic>, thus excluding the wicked.</p>
<p>According to the plain meaning of Scripture, the verse mentions cursing the deaf [in order that we may deduce] that if in the case of one who cannot hear and will not become incensed by the curse, the Torah nonetheless admonished against cursing him, how much more so [is it prohibited to curse] one who hears and feels the insult, and will become hot-tempered because of it&#x0021; Moreover, Scripture always admonishes against doing that which is frequent, for a person is inclined to curse the deaf and put a stumbling-block before the blind since he does not fear them, because <italic>they know not, neither do they understand</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1728">61</xref></sup> Therefore [it states here], <italic>and thou shalt fear thy G-d</italic>, Who sees the secret things. And He added another prohibition against cursing rulers, the prince and the judge,<sup><xref rid="fn1723">56</xref></sup> because it is usual for people to curse them in their bed-chamber<sup><xref rid="fn1729">62</xref></sup> <italic>when in judging him he lets him go forth condemned</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1730">63</xref></sup> and there are many harms that are caused by cursing a prince or a judge, for the masses of people in their foolishness will hate them and will thus be stirred to rise up against them, while in truth the prince and judge establish the land by their justice.<sup><xref rid="fn1731">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. THOU SHALT NOT &#x2018;THEILEICH RACHIL&#x2019; (GO UP AND DOWN AS A TALEBEARER) AMONG THY PEOPLE. &#x201C;I say that because all those who sow discord [among brethren]<sup><xref rid="fn1732">65</xref></sup> and speak slander go into their friends&#x2019; houses in order to spy out what evil they can see or hear, so that they may tell it in the street &#x2014; therefore they are called <italic>holchei rachil</italic> or <italic>holchei regilah</italic> (&#x2018;those who go about spying&#x2019;) etc. And so did Onkelos translate [the verse before us]: <italic>lo theichul kurtzin</italic> [literally: &#x2018;thou shalt not eat <italic>kurtzin</italic>&#x2019;, which has the same meaning as], <italic>&#x2018;va&#x2019;achalu kartzeihon&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and they brought accusation against</italic>) <italic>the Jews;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1733">66</xref></sup> &#x2018;<italic>achlu kurtza</italic> (they slandered him) to the king.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1734">67</xref></sup> It appears to me that it was their custom to eat something in the house of him who accepted their slanderous words, this being a sort of final confirmation that the slanderer&#x2019;s words are well-founded, and that he would stand by them. It was this snack that was called &#x2018;the eating of <italic>kurtzin</italic>,&#x2019; [the word being associated with] the [Hebrew] expression, <italic>&#x2018;koreitz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he that winketh</italic>) <italic>with his eyes</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1735">68</xref></sup> for such is the manner of all who go about slandering, to wink with their eyes, and to insinuate slanderous matters in order that [others who happen to] hear them should not understand them.&#x201D; All this is the language of the Rabbi [Rashi].</p>
<p>But his explanation of this rendition of Onkelos has neither rhyme nor reason.<sup><xref rid="fn1736">69</xref></sup> For one who listens to a slanderer does not swear to him that he will believe his words, and [therefore the slanderer] need not give him a sign or token [to believe him]&#x0021; Even when one slanders a servant to his master,<sup><xref rid="fn1737">70</xref></sup> the master does not assure him that he will listen to him, and so what sense is there to this &#x201C;eating&#x201D; [by the slanderer, as Rashi mentioned]? And Nebuchadnezzar did what he decided to do on the basis of his own decision about the righteous ones,<sup><xref rid="fn1738">71</xref></sup> and He did not offer food to the slanderers [to establish the veracity of their report], neither did he swear to them [that he would believe them], nor did he in fact believe them. Instead, he asked [of the righteous ones], <italic>Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn1739">72</xref></sup> and he commanded that if henceforth they were to bow to the image of gold that he had made, he would forgive them for their transgressions in the past&#x0021; [All this shows that <italic>va&#x2019;achalu kartzeihon</italic> does not refer to a meal eaten by the slanderers, to serve as the final confirmation that their slander was well-grounded, since in the case of Nebuchadnezzar, where this expression occurs, the king did not accept their report&#x0021;] Nor did King Darius offer food to the slanderers of Daniel,<sup><xref rid="fn1740">73</xref></sup> except for <italic>the wormwood and the gall</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1741">74</xref></sup> and yet it is written of them, <italic>those men that &#x2018;achalu kartzohi&#x2019; of Daniel&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1742">75</xref></sup> And even if it is true that it was so done in those [later] times, but since Scripture states <italic>thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people</italic>, why should Onkelos have mentioned this foolish custom [of the slanderer eating a little snack in the house of him who listened to his slanderous words], when it does not affect the admonition itself? Instead, the essential meaning of the Aramaic expression here [i.e., <italic>lo theichul kurtzin</italic>, is not a prohibition against &#x201C;eating <italic>kurtzin</italic>,&#x201D; but] is only a term for the act of making a sound, this usage being common in the language of the Sages:<sup><xref rid="fn1743">76</xref></sup> &#x201C;And even if it were but goats, would they not <italic>achluyei michlulei</italic> (have to be shouted at)? And would you not have [to hire] a person <italic>l&#x2019;achluyei</italic> (to shout) at them?&#x201D; Jonathan [ben Uziel] translated: <italic>Cry aloud</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1744">77</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>&#x2018;achlei;&#x2019; and &#x2018;He will hiss&#x2019; unto them from the end of the earth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1745">78</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;yachlilei;&#x2019; &#x2018;and they shall roar&#x2019; against them like the roaring of the sea</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1746">79</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;yachlei&#x2019;</italic> against them. Similarly [Jonathan has translated] in many places. Thus the term <italic>achal</italic> [in Aramaic] denotes every form of making sound, whereby one makes his wish known without uttering words. Therefore this term was used [by the Sages, as mentioned above] to describe one who shouts at goats that enter a field, and [Jonathan used the same term in translating the Hebrew for] hissing,<sup><xref rid="fn1745">78</xref></sup> roaring<sup><xref rid="fn1746">79</xref></sup> and crying aloud.<sup><xref rid="fn1744">77</xref></sup> Now the way of talebearers is to come amongst a multitude of people, or before a ruler, and utter sounds in a guttural manner, and wink with their eyes, in order to hint that they have heard certain important matters until they press upon them that they tell them. This is why [talebearers in Aramaic] are called <italic>ochlei kurtzin</italic>, meaning &#x201C;those who roar with hints.&#x201D; And Onkelos who translated [the Hebrew] <italic>rechiluth</italic> (talebearing) [as <italic>theichul kurtzin</italic> &#x2014; muttering hints], rendered into Aramaic the idea of the Hebrew, and was not particular to explain the precise meaning of the Scriptural expression. Such is always his style, since his intention is to make the subject understandable [and not necessarily to translate literally]. But in the Sacred Language talebearers are called <italic>holchei rachil</italic>, from the expressions, <italic>all powders of the &#x2018;rachil&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>merchant</italic>)<italic>;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1747">80</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;rechulatheich&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thy merchandise</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1748">81</xref></sup> For the <italic>rocheil</italic> (peddler) goes about the whole day, buying merchandise in various other places, just as the Sages mention,<sup><xref rid="fn1749">82</xref></sup> &#x201C;peddlers that go around from town to town,&#x201D; [and similarly the <italic>holchei rachil</italic> carry tales as if they were merchandise, from place to place]. And this is the sense of the word <italic>b&#x2019;amecha</italic> (among thy people) &#x2014; <italic>Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer &#x2018;among thy people&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; since the talebearer walks among many people. To differentiate between the two [the talebearer and the peddler], the talebearer was called <italic>rocheil</italic>, in a verbal form, [as the term <italic>rocheil</italic> can also signify the act of talebearing], while the peddler was called <italic>rachil</italic>, which is an adjectival noun denoting the person himself, just like <italic>saris</italic> (chief), <italic>nazir</italic> (a Nazirite), the name <italic>rachil</italic> thus hinting that peddling is of his essence, and is an act which reflects upon his person.</p>
<p>17. THOU SHALT NOT HATE THY BROTHER IN THY HEART. Because it is the way of those who hate a person to cover up their hatred in their hearts, just as it is said, <italic>He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, but he layeth up deceit within him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1750">83</xref></sup> therefore Scripture speaks of the usual events, [mentioning, <italic>thou shalt not hate thy brother &#x2018;in thy heart,&#x2019;</italic> but the law forbids all hating, even if done openly]. THOU SHALT SURELY REBUKE THY NEIGHBOR, This constitutes another commandment, that we must teach him reproof of instruction.<sup><xref rid="fn1751">84</xref></sup> THOU SHALT NOT BEAR SIN BECAUSE OF HIM, for you will bear sin because of his transgression if you do not rebuke him. Onkelos&#x2019; rendition tends towards this explanation, for he translated, &#x201C;and do not receive guilt because of him,&#x201D; meaning that you should not be punished by his sin. Following these commandments He then said [in the following verse] that you are to love your neighbor. Thus he who hates his neighbor violates a negative commandment, and he who loves him, fulfills a positive commandment.</p>
<p>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the expression <italic>&#x2018;hochei&#x2019;ach tochiach&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thou shalt surely rebuke</italic>), is similar to <italic>&#x2018;V&#x2019;hochiach Avraham&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>And Abraham reproved</italic>) <italic>Abimelech</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1752">85</xref></sup> The verse here is thus stating: &#x201C;do not hate your brother in your heart when he does something to you against your will, but instead you are to reprove him, saying, &#x2018;Why did you do thus to me?&#x2019; and you will not bear sin because of him by covering up your hatred of him in your heart and not telling him, for when you will reprove him, he will justify himself before you [so that you will have no cause to hate him], or he will regret his action and admit his sin, and you will forgive him.&#x201D; After that He admonishes [in the following verse] that you are not to take vengeance of him, nor bear a grudge in your heart against him because of what he has done to you, for it is possible that he will not hate him, but yet he will remember in his heart his neighbor&#x2019;s sin against him; therefore He admonished him that he is to erase his brother&#x2019;s sin and transgression against him from his heart. Following that admonition, He commanded that he love him as himself.</p>
<p>18. AND THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF. This is an expression by way of overstatement, for a human heart is not able to accept a command to love one&#x2019;s neighbor as oneself. Moreover, Rabbi Akiba has already come and taught,<sup><xref rid="fn1753">86</xref></sup> &#x201C;Your life takes precedence over the life of your fellow-being.&#x201D; Rather, the commandment of the Torah means that one is to love one&#x2019;s fellow-being in all matters, as one loves all good for oneself.<sup><xref rid="fn1754">87</xref></sup> It is possible that since it does not say &#x201C;and thou shalt love <italic>&#x2018;eth rei&#x2019;acha&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1755">88</xref></sup> as thyself,&#x201D; but instead it likened them in the word <italic>&#x2018;l&#x2019;rei&#x2019;acha&#x2019;</italic> [which literally means &#x201C;to&#x201D; thy neighbor], and similarly it states with reference to a proselyte, <italic>and thou shalt love &#x2018;lo&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>him</italic>) [but literally: &#x201C;to&#x201D; him] <italic>as thyself</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1756">89</xref></sup> that the meaning thereof is to equate the love of both [himself and his neighbor, or himself and the proselyte] in his mind. For sometimes a person will love his neighbor in certain matters, such as doing good to him in material wealth but not with wisdom and similar matters. But if he loves him completely, he will want his beloved friend to gain riches, properties, honor, knowledge and wisdom. However [because of human nature] he will still not want him to be his equal, for there will always be a desire in his heart that he should have more of these good things than his neighbor. Therefore Scripture commanded that this degrading jealousy should not exist in his heart, but instead a person should love to do abundance of good for his fellow-being as he does for himself, and he should place no limitations upon his love for him. It is for this reason that it is said of Jonathan&#x2019;s [love for David], <italic>for he loved him as he loved his own soul</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1757">90</xref></sup> because Jonathan had removed [altogether] the attribute of jealousy from his heart, and he said [to David], <italic>and thou shalt be king over Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1758">91</xref></sup> etc.</p>
<p>Our Rabbis have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn1759">92</xref></sup> the matters of taking vengeance and guarding a grudge [which are here forbidden], that they apply to cases where there is no monetary obligation, such as, &#x201C;Lend me your sickle, lend me your hatchet.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1760">93</xref></sup> For in a case where his friend owes him money, such as because of damage that he caused him or for similar reasons, one is not obliged to let his friend go free. On the contrary, he should sue him before the court and receive payment from him, on the basis of the verse which states, <italic>as he hath done, so shall it be done to him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1761">94</xref></sup> and he [who caused the damage] is himself obliged to pay just as he must pay back that which he borrowed or robbed; and how much more so in matters of life, [the next of kin] should take vengeance and guard the grudge against the murderer, until the blood of his brother be redeemed by a court that will render judgment according to the laws of the Torah.</p>
<p>19. YE SHALL KEEP &#x2018;CHUKOTHAI&#x2019; (MY STATUTES). &#x201C;And these are they: <italic>thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind</italic>, etc. <italic>Chukim</italic> (statutes) are the decrees of the King for which there is no reason [given].&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But our Rabbis have not mentioned that the reasons for the commandments [mentioned in this verse] are hidden from us, and that the evil inclination and the idolaters raise objections against them, except in [the case of the prohibition against] wearing a garment made of wool and linen, but not in the case of mating of animals of diverse kinds [for which there is a reason, as will be explained later on].<sup><xref rid="fn1762">95</xref></sup> And the intention of the Rabbis [in defining &#x201C;statutes&#x201D; as the laws of the King for which there is no reason] was not that these are decrees of the King of kings for which there are no reasons whatever, <italic>for every word of G-d is tried</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1763">96</xref></sup> [They meant] only that &#x201C;statutes&#x201D; are like the enactments which a king promulgates for his kingdom, without revealing their benefits to the people, and the people, not sensing these reasons, entertain questions about them in their hearts but they accept them nonetheless out of fear of the government. Similarly, &#x201C;the statutes&#x201D; of the Holy One, blessed be He, are His secrets in the Torah, which the people by means of their thinking do not grasp as they do in the case of <italic>mishpatim</italic> [&#x201C;ordinances&#x201D; &#x2014; laws which conform to the human conception of justice], but yet they <italic>all</italic> have a proper reason and perfect benefit.</p>
<p>Now the reason for [the prohibitions against] <italic>kilayim</italic> [&#x201C;mixed kinds,&#x201D; as will be explained further on], is that G-d has created in the world various species among all living things, both plants and moving creatures, and He gave them a power of reproduction enabling them to exist forever as long, as He blessed be He, will desire the existence of the world, and He further endowed them with a power to bring forth [only] after their kind, and that they should never be changed, as it is said with reference to all of them [at the time of Creation], <italic>after its kind</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1764">97</xref></sup> This driving force in the normal mating of animals is for the sake of preserving the species, even as human beings engage in sexual activity for the sake of having children. Thus one who combines two different species, thereby changes and defies the work of Creation, as if he is thinking that the Holy One, blessed be He, has not completely perfected the world and he desires to help along in the creation of the world by adding to it new kinds of creatures. Moreover, the mating of diverse species of animals does not produce offspring, and even in the case of those that are by nature close to each other [such as the horse and the ass], from which offspring are born, such as mules, their seed is cut off, for they themselves [the mules] cannot produce offspring. Thus from the point of view of these two matters [i.e., the changing in the order of Creation and the sterility of the product, we see that] the act of combining different species is despicable and futile. Even when diverse species of vegetation are grafted together, their fruits do not reproduce afterwards, and they too are prohibited because of the two above-mentioned reasons [for the prohibition of mixing different species together]. This is the meaning of the prohibition [stated here in the verse], <italic>thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed</italic>, which in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn1765">98</xref></sup> constitutes a prohibition against grafting [diverse kinds of trees, or trees and vegetables, and is not a prohibition against merely sowing together diverse kinds of seed].<sup><xref rid="fn1766">99</xref></sup> But He has prohibited also the mere sowing together of diverse kinds of seed, because their nature and form change when they derive nutrition from each other, and thus each kernel of it is as if it were grafted together from two kinds. Similarly, He has forbidden to plow with an ox and an ass together,<sup><xref rid="fn1767">100</xref></sup> because it is customary among tillers of the soil to bring their working animals into one cattle-shed, and there they might come to mate with a diverse kind.<sup><xref rid="fn1768">101</xref></sup> And one of our colleagues<sup><xref rid="fn1769">102</xref></sup> adds to the reason for the prohibition against mixing seeds, that it is in order not to throw into disorder the primary forces which bring about the growth of the plants, when they derive nutrition from each other,<sup><xref rid="fn1770">103</xref></sup> as is indicated in the saying of our Rabbis in Bereshith Rabbah:<sup><xref rid="fn1771">104</xref></sup> &#x201C;Said Rabbi Simon: There is not a single kind of herb that does not have a constellation in heaven which smites it and says to it, &#x2018;Grow.&#x2019; It is with reference to this that Scripture says, <italic>Knowest thou &#x2018;chukoth shamayim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the statutes of heavens</italic>)? <italic>Canst thou establish &#x2018;mishtaro&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the dominion thereof</italic>) <italic>in the earth?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1772">105</xref></sup> &#x2014; [<italic>mishtaro</italic> being derived from the root <italic>shoter</italic> (executive officer)].&#x201D; Now he who grafts diverse kinds of plants or sows seeds of diverse kinds with the intention that they derive nutrition from each other, thereby destroys <italic>&#x2018;chukoth shamayim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the statutes of heavens</italic>). This is why He has said, <italic>Ye shall keep &#x2018;chukothai&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>My statutes</italic>), as they are the statutes of the heavens. And so did Rabbi Chanina in the name of Rabbi Pinchas say,<sup><xref rid="fn1773">106</xref></sup> that [the statutes mentioned here in the verse] are because of &#x201C;the statutes with which I formed My world.&#x201D; I have already written in the section of <italic>Bereshith</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1774">107</xref></sup> that all plants have their foundations in higher [forces], and it is from there that <italic>the Eternal commanded</italic> them <italic>the blessing, even life forever</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1775">108</xref></sup> Thus he who mixes different kinds of seeds, denies and throws into disorder the work of Creation.</p>
<p>NEITHER SHALL THERE COME UPON THEE A GARMENT &#x2018;KILAYIM SHA&#x2019;ATNEIZ&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1776">109</xref></sup> (MIXED OF LINEN AND WOOL). &#x201C;Why is this stated [here, since in Deuteronomy 22:11 quoted further on it is more explicitly stated]? But because it is said [there in Deuteronomy], <italic>Thou shalt not wear &#x2018;sha&#x2019;atneiz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a mingled stuff</italic>), <italic>wool and linen together</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1777">110</xref></sup> I might think that one is not to wear [loose pieces of] wool-shearings and stalks of flax; Scripture therefore states, <italic>a garment</italic>, [thus excluding from the terms of the prohibition the wearing of loose pieces of wool and flax which have not been woven together into a garment]. Whence do I know to include felted stuff [of linen and wool, which, though not spun and woven, are pressed into one material and worn as a garment]? Scripture therefore says, <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic> &#x2014; that which is <italic>shu&#x2019;a</italic> (combed), <italic>tavui</italic> (spun) and <italic>nuz</italic> (twisted) together. And I say that the word <italic>nuz</italic> is an expression for materials which are compressed and twined one with the other to be joined [into a coherent web].&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>But it does not appear to me to be correct, for felted stuff [of linen and wool] is not forbidden by law of the Torah, but only by enactment of the Rabbis, since it is only combed [but not spun and twisted, so why then did Rashi include it under the term <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic>,] since that word implies all three actions &#x2014; combing, spinning and twisting? And so we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn1778">111</xref></sup> &#x201C;Felted stuff [of wool and linen] is forbidden because it is combed,&#x201D; [which clearly indicates that it is not spun and twisted]. And in the Gemara the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1779">112</xref></sup> &#x201C;Perhaps I might say [that Scripture prohibited wool and linen if they were] only combed, or spun, or twisted&#x0021;&#x201D; And the Gemara came to the conclusion: &#x201C;The final law is as Mar Zutra [who said that this Scriptural prohibition applies only if all three acts were done], since the Merciful One expressed them all in one term&#x201D; [<italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic>, which as mentioned above is a combination of three words: <italic>shu&#x2019;a</italic> (combed), <italic>tavui</italic> (spun) and <italic>nuz</italic> (twisted)]. But the Beraitha taught in the Torath Kohanim, stating:<sup><xref rid="fn1780">113</xref></sup> &#x201C;I know only that a garment [must not be worn if made of wool and linen together]. But whence do I know to include felted stuff? From that which the verse states, <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic>&#x201D; &#x2014; that Beraitha intends to include things which are not &#x201C;a garment,&#x201D; on the basis of the verse <italic>Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1777">110</xref></sup> since the word &#x201C;garment&#x201D; is not mentioned there, [but it does not intend to teach, as Rashi interpreted it, that wool and linen even if only combed but not spun and twisted, are already forbidden as <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic>]. This interpretation [of the Torath Kohanim] is a basic principle, since even an article which is not &#x201C;a garment&#x201D; [if worn as a vestment] is also forbidden by law of the Torah to be made of wool and linen, such as where one plaits threads [of wool and linen] and makes of them a belt, or anything similar, providing only that the threads were combed, spun and twisted. The Torath Kohanim mentioned &#x201C;felted stuffs&#x201D; merely as a Biblical support for a Rabbinical enactment, since these are forbidden only by the law of the Rabbis, as they are not &#x201C;a garment&#x201D; [because the two diverse materials are only combed, but not spun and twisted].</p>
<p>Similarly, in respect of that which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote with reference to combing, that [the wool and linen] must also be compressed and twisted together, and in a similar manner he also wrote in his commentaries to the Gemara,<sup><xref rid="fn1781">114</xref></sup> other scholars,<sup><xref rid="fn1782">115</xref></sup> have already commented that Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation is not in accord with what the Rabbis have said [in the following text of the Talmud]:<sup><xref rid="fn1783">116</xref></sup> &#x201C;You must deduce from this<sup><xref rid="fn1784">117</xref></sup> that the upper knots<sup><xref rid="fn1785">118</xref></sup> in the Fringes are required by Scriptural law. For if you should think that they are not required by Scriptural law, why then did the Merciful One have to state a [special] permission for using mingled stuff of wool and linen in Fringes&#x0021; Do we not hold the law to be established that if one fastens two pieces together with only one stitch, it is not considered joined&#x0021;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1786">119</xref></sup> Thus the Rabbis [of the Talmud] have revealed to us that a garment made of linen, in which woolen fringes have been tied with two knots, constitutes diverse kinds by law of the Torah, even though they have not been compressed and twined together&#x0021;</p>
<p>Rather, the matter is as follows: Scripture here stated, <italic>Neither shall there come upon thee a garment &#x2018;kilayim sha&#x2019;atneiz,&#x2019;</italic> meaning to say that every garment that is made of a <italic>thread</italic> which has been combed, spun and twisted, we should not wear if it is <italic>kilayim</italic>, that is, of mingled stuff. And in the Book of Deuteronomy He explained in addition that we should not wear anything which was combed, spun and twisted of wool and linen if they be together, that is to say, if the wool and linen are joined together with [at least] two stitches. This means to say that [even] if the wool and linen were each combed, spun and twisted separately, they may not be attached together, for when they are joined they constitute <italic>kilayim</italic> (mingled stuff); just as He said [in the preceding verse there], <italic>Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1787">120</xref></sup> that is to say, if they are tied and joined to each other. And in the case of garments, fastening with two stitches already constitutes &#x201C;joining&#x201D; them, it being derived by the Rabbis from the word <italic>together</italic> [<italic>wool and linen &#x2018;together&#x2019;</italic>] that two stitches constitute a joining together. From there [i.e., from the verse in Deuteronomy where the word &#x201C;garment&#x201D; is not mentioned, as it is here in the verse before us], the Rabbis have learned that mingled stuff is forbidden although they are not in a garment, but even if one plaited threads of thick material, and made of them belts, although they were not woven [for a vestment], similar to what we are taught in a Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn1788">121</xref></sup> &#x201C;One may not tie a cord of wool on to one made of linen, in order to bind up the loins.&#x201D; And the expression <italic>nuz</italic> [in the word <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic>] is a shortened word<sup><xref rid="fn1789">122</xref></sup> in this composite term, just like the word <italic>tavui</italic> (spun), of which there is only the letter <italic>teth</italic> [in the word <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic>]. And the meaning thereof [i.e., of the word <italic>nuz</italic>] is in my opinion like the word <italic>naloz</italic> (perversing), of the expressions: <italic>an abomination to the Eternal is &#x2018;naloz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the perverse</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1790">123</xref></sup> meaning he who turns aside and perverses his paths; <italic>&#x2018;unelozim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and perverse</italic>) <italic>in their paths</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1791">124</xref></sup> meaning those who are crooked and turn aside [unto their crooked ways],<sup><xref rid="fn1792">125</xref></sup> for anything which is spun [like a thread] is turned and crooked. This is similar to what we are taught in a Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn1793">126</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Shimon<sup><xref rid="fn1794">127</xref></sup> says: [The meaning of the word <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic> is that he who disregards this law] is perverse and turns his Father in heaven against him,&#x201D; meaning to say that the Glorious Name turns away His merciful ways from him, similar to what is said, <italic>and with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself subtle</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1795">128</xref></sup> And in the language of the Sages, this word [<italic>naloz</italic>] is used in a shortened form, thus:<sup><xref rid="fn1796">129</xref></sup> &#x201C;This can be compared to a king&#x2019;s son <italic>sh&#x2019;noz</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1797">130</xref></sup> his heart upon him, and he took a digging tool to undermine his father&#x2019;s house,&#x201D; [the word <italic>sh&#x2019;noz</italic> meaning] that &#x201C;he turned his heart to an evil path.&#x201D; It is of the same root [as the word <italic>naloz</italic>, in its shortened form <italic>nuz</italic>], that the Sages have said in the Talmud [in Tractate] Sanhedrin:<sup><xref rid="fn1798">131</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Minizyathei</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1799">132</xref></sup> of the master, we could not have answered him at all,&#x201D; that is to say, if you had wanted to insist and turn away the matter [from the right course], we would not have known how to answer you at all. <italic>Nizyathei</italic> is thus like <italic>nilzyathei</italic>, that is to say, &#x201C;his turning away&#x201D; from the correct path. This is the true and correct interpretation in this matter [of <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic>]. It was for this reason that it was necessary for the Torah to grant permission for <italic>kilayim</italic> (mingled stuff) in Fringes,<sup><xref rid="fn1800">133</xref></sup> although the Fringes are not plaited and do not constitute a garment. This then is the law of the Torah [i.e., if the linen garment was made of threads which were combed, spun and twisted, and the woolen threads were likewise combed, spun and twisted, then these two kinds of threads must not be joined together]. However, the Sages prohibited it even if the threads were only made in one way &#x2014; either combed, or spun, or twisted. It is for this reason that we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn1778">111</xref></sup> &#x201C;Felted stuff [of wool and linen] is forbidden because it is combed. An edging of wool on a linen garment<sup><xref rid="fn1801">134</xref></sup> is forbidden since it interlaces the web of the garment.&#x201D; All these are prohibited by law of the Rabbis.<sup><xref rid="fn1802">135</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the reason for the prohibition of mingled stuff in garments is in order to keep far away from the mixing together of different species, and He therefore prohibited [the threads, i.e., of wool and linen] from which garments are usually made. But the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] had said in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup><xref rid="fn1803">136</xref></sup> that the reason for the prohibition of wearing a garment made of wool and linen, is because at that time this kind of garment was used by the priests and magicians to adorn themselves when performing their activities, and he [Maimonides] says that he found it so written in their books. And since this was for them a matter of great importance, and very much desired by them in order that they should do their activities [in honor of] the idols and demons, therefore the Torah removed it from being worn by all people, since the Torah intends to blot out their deeds and efface their memory.</p>
<p>20. AND WHOSOEVER LIETH CARNALLY WITH A WOMAN THAT IS A BONDMAID, &#x2018;NECHEREPHETH&#x2019; FOR A MAN &#x2014; &#x201C;&#x2018;Destined&#x2019; for a man. I know not of a similar usage of this root [<italic>choraph</italic>] in Scripture.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. It appears to me that it is associated with the expression, <italic>as I was in the days of &#x2018;chorpi,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1804">137</xref></sup> meaning, in the days of my youth. Similarly, <italic>my heart shall not &#x2018;yecheraph&#x2019; me so long as I live</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1805">138</xref></sup> meaning that I will not have the heart of a youth [who has not yet matured in wisdom]. The days of youth are called &#x201C;the days of <italic>choreph</italic>&#x201D; [a term which means &#x201C;winter&#x201D;], since the winter is at the beginning of the year, while the days of old age correspond to the summer which are the days of gathering in. Scripture, then, is stating here that she is a bondmaid, a young girl designated for a certain man, for a concubine who ministers to a man and with whom he has sexual relations, is called &#x201C;his maiden,&#x201D; just as every ministering person is also called [the master&#x2019;s] lad. It is very common in the language of the Sages to say of a woman who has sexual relations with a man, that she is &#x201C;an attendant to him.&#x201D; And it is this [relationship that is here called] <italic>necherepheth</italic>, meaning that she has become a maiden [&#x2014; attendant] to a man, and is known to him, called in the vernacular [i.e., in Spanish] <italic>mancipada</italic> (designated to a man). In the language of the Sages likewise we find the expression:<sup><xref rid="fn1806">139</xref></sup> &#x201C;that slave&#x2019;s girl&#x201D; [assigned to him by his master]. Thus the meaning thereof is that she is not completely as his wife, but he has betrothed her and she is to him a maiden-attendant.</p>
<p>&#x2018;BIKORETH&#x2019; (AN INVESTIGATION) SHALL BE MADE. &#x201C;It is for the court to investigate the matter in order not to make him liable to death [that is to say, if she were a free woman betrothed to a man, and she had committed adultery, the punishment would be death, but this is not the case in this instance]. BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT FREE, and her betrothal was not complete.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, and so did all the commentators<sup><xref rid="fn1807">140</xref></sup> interpret the verse. And if so, Scripture then is warning the court to make this investigation because she is like a married woman, and they might [easily] make a mistake [in deciding his punishment]. But their interpretation does not please me, for it is a fact that is self-understood that the matter will be investigated, and that the court will not kill a person in vain. For they do such an investigation in all cases involving the death penalty&#x0021;</p>
<p>Now it is my opinion that this [word <italic>bikoreth</italic>] is a unique one in Scripture, but it is a common term in the Aramaic language and in the expressions of our Rabbis, namely, the word <italic>hefkeir</italic> [&#x201C;ownerless&#x201D; &#x2014; with the letter <italic>beth</italic> in <italic>bikoreth</italic> and the letter <italic>fei</italic> in <italic>hefkeir</italic> interchanging]. For the word is essentially <italic>hevkeir</italic> [with the letter <italic>veth</italic>, which is equivalent to the <italic>beth</italic> in <italic>bikoreth</italic>], just as the Rabbis have said [in a Mishnah]:<sup><xref rid="fn1808">141</xref></sup> &#x201C;The School of Shammai say: <italic>Hevkeir</italic> [produce that is proclaimed ownerless] for the benefit of the poor [only], is deemed <italic>hevkeir</italic> [and therefore the produce is free from the obligation to give tithes, since ownerless produce is exempt from tithes].<sup><xref rid="fn1809">142</xref></sup> And the School of Hillel say: [It is not valid] unless the owner makes it equally free for the rich, just as in the Sabbatical year&#x201D; [when the produce of the field is free for poor and rich alike, and is exempt from tithes]. And again we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup><xref rid="fn1810">143</xref></sup> &#x201C;One may eat [produce of the Sabbatical year] which has been brought into the house <italic>al hamuvkar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1811">144</xref></sup> [only as long as similar produce is still found &#x2018;free&#x2019; in the field as food for the animals], but not as long as it is still found watched over in private ownership.&#x201D; Yonathan ben Uziel also translated, <italic>vain and light fellows</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1812">145</xref></sup> as &#x201C;idlers <italic>uvakrin</italic>,&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x201C;and &#x2018;free&#x2019; men&#x201D; [i.e., men defying the law]. <italic>By their lies and &#x2018;by their wantonness&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1813">146</xref></sup> [Yonathan ben Uziel translated] <italic>uvakrithon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1814">147</xref></sup> (&#x201C;and by their irresponsibility&#x201D;). They also say<sup><xref rid="fn1815">148</xref></sup> that the expression, <italic>and the seventh year thou shalt let it rest &#x2018;u&#x2019;n&#x2019;tashta&#x2019;</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1816">149</xref></sup> the Jerusalem Targum<sup><xref rid="fn1817">150</xref></sup> renders as <italic>uthevakarno</italic> [&#x201C;and thou shalt renounce ownership thereof,&#x201D; thus also using the root <italic>hefkeir</italic> in the form of <italic>hevkeir</italic>]. Similarly throughout the Mishnah [the term <italic>hefkeir</italic>] is written with a <italic>veth</italic> [i.e., <italic>hevkeir</italic>]. But in the Gemara they became used to saying <italic>hefkeir</italic> [with a <italic>fei</italic>], as these letters [the <italic>veth</italic> and the <italic>fei</italic>] were used interchangeably by them, just as from the expression <italic>the grains &#x2018;ovshu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>shrivel</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1818">151</xref></sup> they used the word <italic>&#x2018;ofshu&#x2019;</italic> (musty). This is likewise found in many places in the Scriptures, as I have mentioned on the verse <italic>Thou didst blow with Thy wind</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1819">152</xref></sup> And the interpretation of this verse [before us] is as follows: He says concerning this bondmaid that &#x201C;although she is &#x2018;attending&#x2019; this man, she is not considered his wife because she is to him <italic>bikoreth</italic>, that is to say, she is treated by him as a loose person, and therefore <italic>they are not to be put to death</italic> as is the law of the adulterer and the adulteress when the woman is [properly] married; <italic>for freedom has not been given to her</italic> [from her status as a bondmaid] to be his real wife [and therefore he who lies carnally with her is not to be put to death], but instead he is to bring a guilt-offering because <italic>she is designated for a man</italic>.&#x201D; And Onkelos who translated <italic>&#x2018;bikoreth&#x2019; shall be made</italic> as &#x201C;<italic>bikurto</italic> shall be made,&#x201D; uses a language similar to that of Yonathan ben Uziel, in his rendition [of the Hebrew <italic>ufochazim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1812">145</xref></sup> (and light follows)] as <italic>uvakrin</italic> (men defying the Law).<sup><xref rid="fn1820">153</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. &#x2018;VA&#x2019;ARALTEM ORLATHO&#x2019; THE FRUIT THEREOF. &#x201C;[This means literally]: &#x2018;ye shall close its closing,&#x2019; meaning that it shall be closed up and hidden so as not to have any benefit from it.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, and he has explained it well. And if so, <italic>&#x2018;erel&#x2019; of heart</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1821">154</xref></sup> means &#x201C;closed of heart,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1822">155</xref></sup> just as it is said, <italic>and I will rend the enclosure of their heart</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1823">156</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>&#x2018;areila&#x2019; is their ear</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1824">157</xref></sup> means &#x201C;their ear is closed and dulled so that no sound enters therein.&#x201D; And <italic>&#x2018;aral&#x2019; of the lips</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1825">158</xref></sup> means &#x201C;closed of lips,&#x201D; for defective speech is a result of an impediment and obstruction in the veins of the tongue, or sometimes in those of the lips, which have not been properly opened. Speech is referred to in Scripture by the term &#x201C;opening,&#x201D; thus: <italic>Open thy mouth for the dumb</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1826">159</xref></sup> [which means, &#x201C;speak up in the cause of the dumb&#x201D;]<italic>; Job opened his mouth;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1827">160</xref></sup> <italic>and the opening of my lips shall be right things;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1828">161</xref></sup> <italic>keep the doors</italic> [literally: &#x201C;openings&#x201D;] <italic>of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1829">162</xref></sup> Now Scripture uses the expression &#x201C;closing up&#x201D; with reference to the fruit of the first three years, so as to prohibit the deriving of any benefit from it, although it does not express it in this way with reference to other things from which we are also forbidden to derive any benefit [e.g., diverse kinds in a vineyard].<sup><xref rid="fn1830">163</xref></sup> This is because the appearance of the fruit in its earliest stage is called &#x201C;opening,&#x201D; just as it is said, <italic>the vine-blossom has opened</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1831">164</xref></sup> Therefore He said, <italic>three years shall it be &#x2018;areilim&#x2019; unto you</italic>, as if the fruits are closed up in the trees, and have not put forth buds nor opened blossoms.</p>
<p>The reason for this commandment is to honor the Eternal with the first of all our produce of the fruits of the tree and the increase of the vineyard, and that we are not to eat of them until we bring all the fruit of one year [i.e., the fourth year after the planting] <italic>for giving praise unto the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1832">165</xref></sup> Now the fruit of the first three years is not fit to be brought before <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1833">166</xref></sup> because it is small; neither does the tree in its first three years impart good taste or flavor into its fruit. Besides, most trees do not bring forth fruit at all until the fourth year. Therefore we are to wait with all of them [an equal period of time], and are not to taste of their fruit until we have brought of the planting which we have done, all its first good fruit to be holy before G-d, and there [in Jerusalem] we are to eat it and praise the Name of the Eternal. Thus this commandment is like that of the first-fruits.<sup><xref rid="fn1834">167</xref></sup> It is furthermore true that the fruit which comes forth from the tree when it is first planted, contains an abundance of moisture which attaches to and is harmful to the body and it is not good to eat it, just like a fish which has no scales and all food, forbidden by the Torah, which are harmful also<sup><xref rid="fn1835">168</xref></sup> to the body.</p>
<p>The Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] also gave in the Moreh Nebuchim the same type of reason for this commandment as he gave for most of these commandments, namely, that the magicians and sorcerers of those days used to practice certain deeds of witchcraft at the time of the planting of the trees, thinking that by so doing they would accelerate the coming out of the fruits before their natural time, and when the fruits appeared, they would offer them to the idol in the name of which that witchcraft was performed. Therefore the Torah commanded that the fruits which come out before three years [after the planting of the tree] should be forbidden [to derive any benefit from], in order that people should not come to practice these evil deeds, for most trees bring forth fruits in the fourth year, and that we are then to eat them before G-d [in Jerusalem], contrary to their eating of them before the idols.</p>
<p>26. YE SHALL NOT EAT WITH THE BLOOD. &#x201C;This passage has been explained in many different ways in Tractate Sanhedrin.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1836">169</xref></sup> This is the language of Rashi. Now the conclusion of that discussion in the Talmud is that all those interpretations [of the verse before us] are Torah-ordained, since Scripture included all manner of &#x201C;eating with the blood&#x201D; in one negative commandment. And if so, that which Scripture states in the case of Saul, <italic>Behold, the people sin against the Eternal, in that they eat with the blood</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1837">170</xref></sup> means that they transgressed one of the prohibitions included in this negative commandment, since they were eating of an animal [slaughtered properly] before its life had entirely left it. It is with reference to this that Scripture states there, <italic>And the people flew upon the spoil</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1838">171</xref></sup> like a bird of prey that tears its victim and eats it, <italic>and they took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the blood</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1838">171</xref></sup> Because of the abundance of spoil of cattle [that they had taken from the Philistines], as soon as [they were slaughtered properly and] their blood was spilled on the ground, they tore off their limbs and ate them before life had entirely left the animals.</p>
<p>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, this seems to have been a kind of witchcraft or divination, since [the meaning of this passage] may be deduced from its context; [i.e., from the second half of this verse which states, <italic>neither shall ye practice divination nor soothsaying</italic>, we may deduce that the first half of the verse, <italic>Ye shall not eat with the blood</italic> also refers to some form of witchcraft, as will be explained]. Thus they used to spill the blood [of the cattle] and gather it in a hollow, which was then attended, according to their opinion, by the satyrs, and they<sup><xref rid="fn1839">172</xref></sup> would eat at their tables to tell them future events. Now when the Israelites were at that time camping with Saul, they were very much afraid of the Philistines, and Saul did nothing except for inquiring of the Urim and Thummim,<sup><xref rid="fn1840">173</xref></sup> as it is said, <italic>Let us draw near hither unto G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1841">174</xref></sup> while the people were inquiring of the satyrs or of witchcraft to know their way and what to do, and they were eating <italic>with the blood</italic> in order to perform that craft [mentioned above]. It is for this reason that Scripture there states, <italic>Then they told Saul, saying: &#x2018;Behold, the people sin against the Eternal, in that they eat with the blood.&#x2019; And he said: &#x2018;Ye have dealt treacherously,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1842">175</xref></sup> meaning to say: &#x201C;Behold, G-d has wrought for you this day this great salvation, and you inquire of no-gods&#x0021; It is treachery&#x0021;&#x201D; I will yet explain the prohibition against soothsaying and enchanting.<sup><xref rid="fn1843">176</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. PROFANE NOT THY DAUGHTER, TO MAKE HER A HARLOT. &#x201C;This refers to one who gives his unmarried daughter [to a man] without the intention of betrothal. LEST THE LAND FALL INTO HARLOTRY. If you do so, the soil too will be unfaithful to you and it will produce its fruits in another place and not in your Land. And so does Scripture state, <italic>Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there hath been no latter rain, and thou hadst a harlot&#x2019;s forehead</italic> etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1844">177</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But I have not understood his opinion, for the term &#x201C;harlotry&#x201D; in the Torah nowhere applies to an unmarried woman, since it is the accepted decision of the law<sup><xref rid="fn1845">178</xref></sup> that if an unmarried man has sexual relations with an unmarried woman, without the intention of thereby making her his wife, he has [nonetheless] not rendered her thereby &#x201C;a harlot.&#x201D; And in Tractate Sanhedrin the Sages have clearly stated this principle:<sup><xref rid="fn1846">179</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by becoming a harlot</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1847">180</xref></sup> I might think that this applies even if she be unmarried.&#x201D; Thereupon the Rabbis asked:<sup><xref rid="fn1848">181</xref></sup> &#x201C;[But how could one think this to be the case?] Is it not written <italic>by becoming a harlot</italic> [and the term &#x2018;harlot&#x2019; applies only to a <italic>married</italic> woman who commits adultery]?&#x201D; To this question the Rabbis answered, that [the above supposition was] &#x201C;in accordance with the [unaccepted] opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who said that if an unmarried man has sexual relations with an unmarried woman, without the intention of thereby making her his wife, he <italic>does</italic> render her &#x2018;a harlot.&#x2019;&#x201D; [From this text it is obvious that the accepted opinion of the Sages is that if she was unmarried, he does <italic>not</italic> render her &#x201C;a harlot.&#x201D;] Similarly the Rabbis have said that the verse <italic>They</italic> [i.e., the priests] <italic>shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profaned</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1849">182</xref></sup> does not apply to an unmarried woman, but only to a proselytess and a freed bondwoman, or to one who had intercourse with a man in the nature of fornication, such as with a man whose betrothal to her would not be valid, as is explained in Yebamoth<sup><xref rid="fn1845">178</xref></sup> and in the Sifra:<sup><xref rid="fn1850">183</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>A woman that is a harlot</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1849">182</xref></sup> Rabbi Yehudah says that this refers to a sterile woman. But the Sages say: The word &#x2018;harlot&#x2019; refers only to a proselytess, a freed bondwoman, or to one who had intercourse with a man in the nature of fornication. Rabbi Eliezer says: Even if an unmarried man has sexual relations with an unmarried woman, without the intention of thereby making her his wife, this too [is a case of the &#x2018;harlot&#x2019;].&#x201D; Similarly the Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn1851">184</xref></sup> with reference to the prohibition, <italic>Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot &#x2026; into the House of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1852">185</xref></sup> that this has no application whatever to an unmarried woman. But the Beraitha taught in the Torath Kohanim<sup><xref rid="fn1853">186</xref></sup> [which is the source for Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation] and which is also mentioned in Tractate Sanhedrin<sup><xref rid="fn1854">187</xref></sup> [namely, that the verse before us refers to one who gives his <italic>unmarried</italic> daughter for immorality], may either be in accordance with the teaching of Rabbi Eliezer [mentioned above] and is not the final decision of the law, or it may be a case of one who gives his [unmarried] daughter for immorality with a person with whom she can contract no marital status, such as with a Cuthean or a slave, or any of those persons [with whom sexual relations are forbidden] by punishment of excision or death by the hands of the court, which is &#x201C;harlotry&#x201D; in the opinion of the Sages. It is this which they intended in saying, &#x201C;[this verse refers to] one who gives his unmarried daughter to a man without the intention of marriage,&#x201D; that is to say, to a man with whom it is impossible that there be a marital status.</p>
<p>Similarly, that which the Rabbi taught there in the Sifra<sup><xref rid="fn1855">188</xref></sup> with reference to the expression <italic>lest the Land fall into harlotry</italic>, that the fruits of the Land will turn faithless [and grow in other places and not in your Land], is a homiletic exposition derived from the word <italic>ha&#x2019;aretz</italic> (the Land), since it is not written &#x201C;lest <italic>the people</italic> of the Land fall into harlotry.&#x201D; But the main intention of this expression is [to establish] a second negative commandment, which the author of the &#x201C;Hilchoth Gedoloth&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1856">189</xref></sup> has already counted in his enumeration of the [three hundred and sixty-five] negative commandments, it being an admonition directed to the man who commits the immoral act and to the daughter herself, that she should not give herself over to immoral relationships. And it is on the basis of this [interpretation of the verse] that the Rabbis have said there in that Beraitha [in Torath Kohanim]: &#x201C;And similarly she who gives herself over to immoral relationships [transgresses a negative commandment].&#x201D; And the meaning of the verse is [as follows]: Since a daughter is in the control of her father, and he is permitted &#x201C;in her youth&#x201D; [i.e., when she is not yet twelve and a half years old] to betroth her to a man, and to cause her to enter the bridal-canopy, and one who violates or seduces her must pay the fine to the father [thus accordingly we might think that the father is at liberty to allow a man to have an immoral relationship with his unmarried daughter], therefore Scripture explained that he is not permitted to give her to anyone for immoral purposes, admonishing [first] the father [against doing it] by means of a negative commandment. After having admonished the father, He warned also those engaged in the harlotry, the man and the woman.</p>
<p>Now Rashi wrote in the section of <italic>Emor El Hakohanim:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1857">190</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>A harlot</italic>. This is a woman who has had sexual intercourse with a man who is forbidden to her [as a husband], such as those [whom she may not marry] under the penalty of excision, or a <italic>Nathin</italic> [a descendant of the Gibeonites<sup><xref rid="fn1858">191</xref></sup>] or a <italic>mamzer</italic>&#x201D; [i.e., a person born from a union which is itself prohibited under the penalty of excision]. Now this comment constitutes an admission on the part of Rashi that the term &#x201C;harlotry&#x201D; does not apply where marriage between them would be possible, except that he does include under this term [of &#x201C;harlotry&#x201D;] also those that are forbidden by means of a negative commandment [the punishment for which being whipping, such as marriage to a <italic>mamzer</italic>]. This is also Rashi&#x2019;s opinion in his commentaries on the Gemara<sup><xref rid="fn1859">192</xref></sup> [i.e., that &#x201C;harlotry&#x201D; applies to all cases where he is forbidden to her &#x2014; even if only under the penalty of whipping]. But this too is not correct, for it is only [by means of intercourse with] those whom she may not marry under the penalty of excision, or a Cuthean or a bondman with whom she can contract no marital status, that she is rendered a &#x201C;harlot&#x201D; so that a priest who takes her as his wife is liable to whipping because of [marrying] a harlot; but [as a result of intercourse] with those whom she is prohibited [to marry] by means of a [mere] negative commandment &#x2014; such as a <italic>mamzer</italic>, or an Ammonite or Moabite proselyte &#x2014; she is not rendered a &#x201C;harlot,&#x201D; and a priest who takes her as his wife is not liable to whipping. However, [as a result of that forbidden relationship], she becomes disqualified from eating the heave-offering and from marrying a priest.<sup><xref rid="fn1860">193</xref></sup> For it is written, <italic>And if a priest&#x2019;s daughter be married unto an &#x2018;ish zar&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1861">194</xref></sup> <italic>she shall not eat of that which is set apart from the holy things</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1862">195</xref></sup> [which the Sages interpreted<sup><xref rid="fn1863">196</xref></sup>]: as soon as she has intercourse with a man she may not marry, he disqualifies her [from eating the holy food].<sup><xref rid="fn1864">197</xref></sup> And [if she has intercourse with a man who is] guilty of transgressing a prohibition affecting only the priesthood [for which he is liable to whipping, such as a High Priest who had intercourse with a widow], she becomes a <italic>chalalah</italic> [a woman of impaired priestly status, and therefore she may not marry even a common priest, who is ordinarily allowed to marry a widow].<sup><xref rid="fn1865">198</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. YE SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS. There are many warnings in the Torah regarding [the observance of] the Sabbath, just as in the case of idolatry, because the law of the Sabbath too, is equal to all the commandments, for one who does not observe it, denies the [Divine] Creation and has no Torah at all.<sup><xref rid="fn1866">199</xref></sup> Our Rabbis have an interpretation on this verse. Thus they said here in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn1867">200</xref></sup> &#x201C;I might think that the building of the Sanctuary overrides the Sabbath; Scripture therefore states, <italic>Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and reverence My Sanctuary: I am the Eternal</italic>&#x201D; [meaning: &#x201C;not even the erection of the Sanctuary can override the keeping of the Sabbath&#x201D;]. And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], He commands here concerning the Great Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn1868">201</xref></sup> and the Sabbath which is His Sanctuary [on high], that it be both guarded and reverenced. For this reason the work on the erection of the Sanctuary [on earth] does not override the Sabbath and the Sanctuary [on high]. The student learned in the mysteries of the Cabala will understand.</p>
<p>32. THOU SHALT RISE UP BEFORE THE HOARY HEAD. &#x201C;I might think that one is to rise before an uncultured old man; Scripture therefore states, <italic>and thou shalt honor the face of &#x2018;zakein&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the old man</italic>). <italic>Zakein</italic> [from the root <italic>kanah</italic>, acquire] means only one who has &#x2018;acquired&#x2019; wisdom.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And the text of the Torath Kohanim,<sup><xref rid="fn1869">202</xref></sup> as it is taught in the Gemara of Tractate Kiddushin<sup><xref rid="fn1870">203</xref></sup> [is as follows: &#x201C;I might think that one is to rise before an uncultured old man; ] Scripture therefore states <italic>zakein</italic>, the word <italic>zakein</italic> meaning only one who is wise, as it is said, <italic>Gather unto Me seventy men &#x2018;miziknei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>of the elders</italic>) <italic>of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1871">204</xref></sup> And Rabbi Yosei the Galilean says: The word <italic>zakein</italic> means only one who has &#x2018;acquired&#x2019; wisdom, as it is said, <italic>The Eternal &#x2018;kanani&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>made me</italic>) [literally: acquired me, i.e., wisdom] <italic>at the beginning of His way</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1872">205</xref></sup> Now according to the words of both of them [i.e., the First Sage in this Beraitha and Rabbi Yosei the Galilean], this commandment [of honoring the aged] applies only if he is a scholar. And Onkelos who rendered the verse before us: &#x201C;thou shalt rise up before him who understands [the knowledge of] the Torah, and honor the face of the aged,&#x201D; would also seem to agree with this opinion [that <italic>zakein</italic> is one who &#x201C;acquired&#x201D; wisdom]. Yet despite all this, the concluding opinion of the Gemara in accordance with the final decision of the law is not so, for the Rabbis have said [in the Gemara]:<sup><xref rid="fn1870">203</xref></sup> &#x201C;Isi the son of Yehudah says: Any hoary head is included [under the terms of this commandment], and Rabbi Yochanan said: The final decision of the law is as Isi the son of Yehudah interpreted it.&#x201D; Thus Scripture is commanding [in the first half of the verse] to honor any old man, even the uncultured, that is, the unlearned, and then [in the second half of the verse] it gives another commandment concerning the <italic>zakein</italic>, that is one who has acquired wisdom, even if he be young and learned. It is possible that this is also the opinion of Onkelos, except that he translated <italic>the hoary head</italic> as &#x201C;young and learned&#x201D; [and hence the <italic>first</italic> half of his translation reads, &#x201C;thou shalt rise up before him who understands &#x2014; the knowledge of the Torah,&#x201D; meaning even if he is young and learned], since the term <italic>zakein</italic> [in the <italic>second</italic> half of the verse, which clearly means &#x201C;one who has acquired wisdom&#x201D;] came and indicated that the term <italic>hoary head</italic> includes all kinds of <italic>old age</italic>, whether old in the knowledge of the Torah or old in days.<sup><xref rid="fn1873">206</xref></sup></p>

<p>3. BECAUSE HE HATH GIVEN OF HIS SEED UNTO MOLECH, TO DEFILE MY SANCTUARY &#x2014; &#x201C;The congregation of Israel which is sanctified unto Me.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. I have already hinted at this,<sup><xref rid="fn1874">207</xref></sup> how on account of one man&#x2019;s sin the congregation of Israel which is sanctified to His Great Name can become defiled. And the Sages have [also] already hinted at this in their homiletic interpretations when saying:<sup><xref rid="fn1875">208</xref></sup> &#x201C;He who enjoys anything of this world without saying a benediction, is considered as if he had robbed the Holy One, blessed be He, and the congregation of Israel, as it is said, <italic>Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith: &#x2018;It is no transgression,&#x2019; the same is the companion of a destroyer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1876">209</xref></sup> The expression <italic>his father</italic> refers only to the Holy One, blessed be He, and <italic>his mother</italic> refers only to the congregation of Israel. <italic>The same is the companion of the destroyer</italic>, he is a companion of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, <italic>who caused Israel to sin</italic>, against their Father in heaven.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1877">210</xref></sup> For the purpose of Creation was that people should offer their benediction over [its bounties] to the Great Name, assuring thereby the existence of the world, but if that is not done, the Great Name is raised on high and the Divine Presence is removed from Israel, and surely this happens all the more so when a person offers his seed to the Molech, and thereby causes that He <italic>abhor the pride of Jacob</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1878">211</xref></sup> and His dwelling place [i.e., the Sanctuary]. This is the meaning of the expression, <italic>the people of the Land shall stone him with stones</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1879">212</xref></sup> for He did not say: &#x201C;he shall surely be put to death; they shall stone him with stones,&#x201D; as is mentioned in all such cases,<sup><xref rid="fn1880">213</xref></sup> but instead mentions <italic>the people of the Land</italic>, meaning to say that all the people of the Land &#x2014; all Israel &#x2014; are obliged to precede to stone him, for [having given of his seed to Molech] he has harmed everybody, because he has caused that the Divine Presence be removed from Israel. It is for this reason that Onkelos translated [the expression, <italic>the people of the Land</italic>]: &#x201C;the people of the house of Israel,&#x201D; for the term <italic>the Land</italic> alludes to the whole Land of Israel, not merely the land wherein the worshipper [of the Molech] happens to reside, this being similar [to the expression], <italic>for all the earth is Mine</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1881">214</xref></sup> The secret thereof you will also be able to understand from that which Scripture mentions with reference to [the punishment of] excision for worshipping the Molech, <italic>I also will set My face against that man</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1882">215</xref></sup> and again, <italic>then will I set My face against that man</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1883">216</xref></sup> meaning that My Great and Fearful Name will cut him off. The word &#x201C;I&#x201D; He did not mention in the case of excision for practicing the sorcery of the <italic>ov</italic> or the <italic>yide&#x2019;oni</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1884">217</xref></sup> nor in the case of any other such punishment. I have already stated the reason for all this to all who understand.<sup><xref rid="fn1885">218</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. TO GO ASTRAY AFTER THE MOLECH. &#x201C;This is intended to include any other idol that was worshipped in that way [i.e., by a person passing his children through the fire], even if that particular idol is ordinarily not worshipped that way.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Now Rashi has already written in the section of <italic>Acharei Moth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1886">219</xref></sup> that the Molech is &#x201C;an idol the name of which is &#x2018;Molech,&#x2019; and this was the way in which it was worshipped: he would hand over his child to the priests etc.&#x201D; But all this does not conform and agree properly with the Gemara&#x2019;s conclusion<sup><xref rid="fn1887">220</xref></sup> as it appears after deliberation. For according to the opinion of the Sage who says that Molech is an idol [and not a name for a form of witchcraft], the worship thereof was not by passing children through the fire, for if so there was no need at all for Scripture to mention this, [i.e., the passing through fire] since it would be included in the admonition against worshipping the idols [in the manner in which they are usually worshipped], of which there are many general prohibitions in the Torah, and it is also included in the punishment stated in the section <italic>If there be found in the midst of thee &#x2026; man or woman, that doeth that which is evil in the sight of the Eternal thy G-d, in transgressing His covenant, and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1888">221</xref></sup> Rather, we must perforce interpret [if Molech is the name of a particular idol] that the essential purpose of Scripture in mentioning [this particular form of worship], was only to make one liable for passing one&#x2019;s children [through fire] even if that particular idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner. And thus the Rabbis have said in the Gemara:<sup><xref rid="fn1887">220</xref></sup> &#x201C;And according to the Sage who is of the opinion that Molech is an idol, why did Scripture state [the punishment of] excision in the case of Molech [when it is already included in the general punishment for all idol-worship]? It is to apply it in the case of one who passes his son [through the fire in honor of any idol, even if that idol is] not ordinarily worshipped in that manner.&#x201D; And the same reasoning applies to the punishment and the admonition which Scripture mentioned with reference to it [this particular form of worship], that they were only necessary [if we hold that Molech is an idol] for the case of one who passed his son [through fire] to an idol which is not normally worshipped in that manner.</p>
<p>It would appear that according to this opinion [that the Molech was idol-worship, and that the main reason why Scripture mentioned this particular form of worship was to prohibit and punish the practice thereof even as an abnormal manner of worship of all other idols], that the term &#x201C;Molech&#x201D; is not a name for a particular graven image or statute, but is a general name for anything that is worshipped, &#x201C;anything which you accept as your king and take upon you as your god.&#x201D; In accordance with this opinion, the children of Ammon called their abhorrence Molech,<sup><xref rid="fn1889">222</xref></sup> because he was their king, the term Molech thus being a general name for all things honored [as deities], for it is derived from the term <italic>malchuth</italic> (royalty). It is thus not like the Rabbi [Rashi] said [in the preceding section of <italic>Acharei Moth</italic>], that Molech is &#x201C;an idol the name of which is &#x2018;Molech,&#x2019; and the manner of its worship&#x201D; was as mentioned. Similarly, that which Rashi wrote here that the phrase <italic>to go astray after the Molech</italic> &#x201C;is necessary to include any other idol that was worshipped in that way, even if that particular idol is ordinarily not worshipped in that way&#x201D; &#x2014; this interpretation too, is impossible [to accept] for the reason that we have mentioned, namely, that the essential basis for the punishment of excision mentioned specifically in the case of the Molech, is to make one liable for practicing before an idol even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner, and this includes all idols&#x0021; [Hence it is not necessary to include them on the basis of the phrase before us in Verse 5 &#x2014; <italic>to go astray after the Molech</italic> &#x2014; when this point is already established the overall statement of excision mentioned in Verse 3 which essentially prohibits that kind of worship to any idol, even if it is not normally worshipped in that way]&#x0021; It is also impossible to say that Scripture made one liable to excision in the case of that idol the name of which is &#x201C;Molech,&#x201D; although passing a child through the fire before it was not its usual mode of worship, and that then it reverts [in the verse before us, stating <italic>to go astray after Molech</italic>, in order, as Rashi said] to include in the punishment of excision he [who passes through the fire of his seed] to Peor or Merkulis [which was also an abnormal mode of worshipping them]. For why was it necessary for Scripture to mention it [i.e., Molech] altogether? Why was that idol [called &#x201C;Molech&#x201D; or &#x201C;Peor&#x201D; or &#x201C;Merkulis&#x201D;] different from all other idols [since the Torah has already prohibited passing one&#x2019;s children through fire before any idol, under punishment of excision even if that particular idol is ordinarily not worshipped that way]? Moreover, if so you would need a special verse to include one who passes his child through the fire to Peor or Merkulis in the punishment of stoning [if there were witnesses to his act and he was given the proper warning], just as Scripture [according to Rashi] included him in the punishment of excision [when there were no witnesses]&#x0021;</p>
<p>Rather, [we must conclude] that Scripture only mentioned the admonition, and the punishments of excision and stoning, in the case of Molech, with reference to one who passes his child through the fire to any idol whatsoever, even if that is not its usual mode of worship. Thus whether you say that the term Molech is a name for all idols [since the name is derived from the word <italic>malchuth</italic>, (royalty)] as we have explained, or whether you say [as Rashi does] that Molech is the name of a particular idol that was so called, [we must say, as explained above] that Scripture mentioned it [in order to prohibit this practice even] if it be an abnormal mode of worship [of that idol, i.e., Molech]; the same law applying to all idols, for this stringency is on account of the frightfulness of this mode of worship. All this is made clear in the Gemara of Tractate Sanhedrin<sup><xref rid="fn1887">220</xref></sup> according to this opinion which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote, that the Molech was an idol. But our Mishnah [which mentions first &#x201C;the idolator&#x201D; and then &#x201C;he that offers of his seed to Molech,&#x201D; thus indicating that Molech is not an idol, for otherwise this would have been included under the law of &#x201C;the idolator&#x201D;],<sup><xref rid="fn1890">223</xref></sup> is taught in accordance with the opinion of the Sage who says that Molech was not an idol, meaning to say, it was not worshipped in a manner of being accepted as a god, but instead it was like a practice of witchcraft, to <italic>seek on behalf of the living unto the dead</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1891">224</xref></sup> unto <italic>this dead dog</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1892">225</xref></sup> According to this opinion, one who passed his seed through the fire to Peor or Merkulis, is not liable [since that form of witchcraft was performed only before Molech, and the Torah specifically mentioned that this practice of witchcraft was done before Molech].<sup><xref rid="fn1893">226</xref></sup> Rashi&#x2019;s words in his commentaries to Tractate Sanhedrin<sup><xref rid="fn1894">227</xref></sup> are also as we have written. And the Beraitha taught in the Torath Kohanim<sup><xref rid="fn1895">228</xref></sup> [which was the source for Rashi&#x2019;s comment mentioned at the beginning of this verse]: &#x201C;<italic>And I will cut him off, and all that go astray after him, to go astray after Molech</italic>. This is intended to include the case of any other idol [which was worshipped in that way, that the worshipper is liable to the punishment of] excision&#x201D; &#x2014; the interpretation of this Beraitha is not based upon the redundant expression <italic>to go astray after Molech</italic>, as appears from the words of the Rabbi [Rashi]. Rather, the Beraitha is stating that this whole [Scriptural passage laying down the law of] excision is redundant, and therefore we are to apply it to any other idol that was worshipped in that way. It is this which the Rabbis have stated in the Gemara:<sup><xref rid="fn1896">229</xref></sup> &#x201C;Why is excision mentioned thrice [as the punishment] for idolatry?<sup><xref rid="fn1897">230</xref></sup> It is prescribed once for [worshipping an idol in] the customary manner; once for worshipping it in a non-customary manner,&#x201D; that is, if he sacrifices, or burns incense, or pours a libation, or bows down before an idol,<sup><xref rid="fn1898">231</xref></sup> which have been included under the punishment of death<sup><xref rid="fn1899">232</xref></sup> even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner, and here [in the verse before us] they are made liable to excision [in the absence of witnesses]. &#x201C;And once excision is mentioned for [the worship of] Molech&#x201D; [for Molech is <italic>not</italic> an idol, but a form of witchcraft which the Torah prohibited by means of this strong form of punishment]. And according to the Sage who says that Molech <italic>is</italic> an idol [we must perforce say that the reason why the Torah singled out the Molech is in order to prohibit and punish] passing a child through the fire before any idol whatever, even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner, as we have mentioned.</p>
<p>9. FOR WHATSOEVER MAN THERE BE THAT CURSETH HIS FATHER OR HIS MOTHER. The meaning thereof is that it refers back to the beginning of the section where He stated, <italic>Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1900">233</xref></sup> and He now states here, <italic>for whatsoever man there be</italic> that does not obey [this commandment] and <italic>curseth his father, or his mother, he shall surely be put to death</italic>, and by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], this verse is here stated because He had said [above], <italic>Sanctify yourselves therefore, and by ye holy; for I am the Eternal your G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1901">234</xref></sup> and <italic>I am the Eternal Who sanctify you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1902">235</xref></sup> meaning that it is <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1903">236</xref></sup> Who sanctifies us, for He is <italic>our Father</italic>, and <italic>our Redeemer from everlasting</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1904">237</xref></sup> and it is His Name; therefore he who curses those who participated in his formation, is liable to death. This is the reason for the law [of the punishment] of the adulterer and adulteress, [in the following verse], which He placed near here before [the law of] all forbidden relations [mentioned further on in this section].<sup><xref rid="fn1905">238</xref></sup> I have already alluded to this above.<sup><xref rid="fn1906">239</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Scripture mentions here some of the forbidden relations in order to make [one who has intercourse with them] liable to death, these being a man&#x2019;s wife,<sup><xref rid="fn1907">240</xref></sup> a father&#x2019;s wife,<sup><xref rid="fn1908">241</xref></sup> a daughter-in-law,<sup><xref rid="fn1909">242</xref></sup> a male,<sup><xref rid="fn1910">243</xref></sup> a woman and her mother,<sup><xref rid="fn1911">244</xref></sup> and the same law applies to a woman and her daughter and her daughter&#x2019;s daughter, for He mentioned here only some of the relations of a wife, but the same punishment applies to all those mentioned there<sup><xref rid="fn1912">245</xref></sup> in the admonition. And surely this applies all the more so to one&#x2019;s own relatives, such as his son&#x2019;s daughter and his daughter&#x2019;s daughter mentioned there,<sup><xref rid="fn1913">246</xref></sup> and needless to say, his [own] daughter. On all these matters there are also Rabbinical interpretations to establish their punishment. Similarly He mentioned here the punishment of death for lying with a beast.<sup><xref rid="fn1914">247</xref></sup> He mentioned excision again in the case of a menstruant<sup><xref rid="fn1915">248</xref></sup> [although this has already been included in a general statement above, 18:29], in order to declare him liable for mere sexual contact without completion of the act, this being the sense of the expression, <italic>he hath bared her fountain</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1915">248</xref></sup> Similarly [He has stated] in the case of a mother&#x2019;s sister and a father&#x2019;s sister, <italic>for he hath bared his near kin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1916">249</xref></sup> He mentioned an uncle&#x2019;s wife<sup><xref rid="fn1917">250</xref></sup> and also a brother&#x2019;s wife,<sup><xref rid="fn1918">251</xref></sup> in order to declare them liable to [the punishment of] dying childless, whether he had no children at the time when he commits the sin, or he did have [in which case none will survive him]. But the excision mentioned in the case of one&#x2019;s sister<sup><xref rid="fn1919">252</xref></sup> is redundant [being included in the general statement above, 18:29], and has therefore been interpreted by our Rabbis:<sup><xref rid="fn1920">253</xref></sup> &#x201C;Why was excision specified in the case of a sister etc.&#x201D; In line with the plain meaning of Scripture [excision was specified in the case of a sister] in order that Scripture should add [that it will be done] <italic>in the sight of the children of their people</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1919">252</xref></sup> meaning to state that <italic>their soul will perish in youth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1921">254</xref></sup> in such a way that people will see, understand and realize <italic>that the hand of the Eternal hath done this</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1922">255</xref></sup> and that the Holy One of Israel has decreed it.</p>
<p>The meaning of the expression <italic>he shall bear his iniquity</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1919">252</xref></sup> is that this sin will cleave to him from that time onwards, his deeds will not prosper, and the curse shall lie upon him,<sup><xref rid="fn1923">256</xref></sup> for G-d will strike him with sore sicknesses until He will destroy him with excision, something similar to what the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1924">257</xref></sup> &#x201C;A sign of [this type of] sin is one affected with dropsy.&#x201D; It was not necessary for Scripture to mention the other people who are liable to excision, such as one&#x2019;s mother<sup><xref rid="fn1925">258</xref></sup> and a wife&#x2019;s sister,<sup><xref rid="fn1926">259</xref></sup> because all that is needed to be stated about them we have already derived from those mentioned [here in this section].</p>
<p>17. AND IF A MAN &#x2018;YIKACH&#x2019; (SHALL TAKE) HIS SISTER. Scripture mentions the term <italic>kichah</italic> [&#x201C;taking,&#x201D; which generally denotes the taking of a woman as a wife] in the case of a sister, although betrothal to her is not valid, because a brother and sister sleep together in one house, and when his desire overpowers him, he takes her and draws her to himself, and he does not have to come to her as one does to a woman who is a harlot. Similarly it is the way of Scripture to use the term &#x201C;taking&#x201D; in the case of all those with whom one remains alone, for a wife and her mother,<sup><xref rid="fn1911">244</xref></sup> [a wife] and her son&#x2019;s daughter and her daughter&#x2019;s daughter,<sup><xref rid="fn1912">245</xref></sup> a wife and her sister,<sup><xref rid="fn1926">259</xref></sup> and a brother&#x2019;s wife<sup><xref rid="fn1927">260</xref></sup> are all [found] with him in one house [hence Scripture uses the term &#x201C;taking&#x201D; in each of these cases]. For a similar reason Scripture uses this expression in the following verse, <italic>A man shall not &#x2018;take&#x2019; his father&#x2019;s wife</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1928">261</xref></sup> The expression <italic>and he see her nakedness</italic> is an euphemism, since Scripture modifies its expression in speaking of forbidden relationships. Sometimes it calls sexual intercourse &#x201C;uncovering of nakedness,&#x201D; as it says in the case of most of the forbidden women, <italic>thou shalt not uncover her nakedness</italic>, for it is the way of those who commit fornication to uncover her skirts, similar to that which is said, <italic>and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1929">262</xref></sup> and at times it calls it &#x201C;entering,&#x201D; thus: <italic>If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1930">263</xref></sup> <italic>to come in unto us;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1931">264</xref></sup> <italic>and he came in unto her, and she conceived by him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1932">265</xref></sup> Many times Scripture calls it &#x201C;lying,&#x201D; and here it refers to it as &#x201C;seeing,&#x201D; since brother and sister lodge together and there is no need for uncovering of skirts. Similarly Scripture uses the euphemism &#x201C;knowing,&#x201D; as in the following expressions: <italic>And the man knew Eve his wife;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1933">266</xref></sup> <italic>and he knew her again no more;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1934">267</xref></sup> <italic>a virgin, neither had any man known her</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1935">268</xref></sup> And Scripture states [here in the verse before us] <italic>and she see his nakedness</italic>, meaning to say that she too desired his nakedness in her heart and consented thereto. Now it mentions these expressions only in the case of a sister, because in all forbidden relations when a man approaches a woman for the purpose of uncovering her nakedness, it is generally with her consent, and otherwise she can remove herself from him and cry for help, but in the case of a brother [and sister] who lodge together, it may be that it was done without her knowledge, and therefore Scripture mentioned that she too &#x201C;saw his nakedness.&#x201D;</p>
<p>IT IS &#x2018;CHESED.&#x2019; In the opinion of the commentators<sup><xref rid="fn1936">269</xref></sup> <italic>chesed</italic> here means &#x201C;shame,&#x201D; because all people will naturally be ashamed of this ugly sin, this being used here as in the Aramaic language, for Onkelos translated, <italic>for that were &#x2018;a disgrace&#x2019; unto us</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1937">270</xref></sup> &#x201C;for that were <italic>chisudo</italic> unto us.&#x201D; Yonathan ben Uziel also translated <italic>and I will lay it for &#x2018;a reproach,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1938">271</xref></sup> &#x201C;[and I will lay it for] <italic>chisudo</italic>.&#x201D; And in the language of the Sages [we find]:<sup><xref rid="fn1939">272</xref></sup> &#x201C;Because <italic>shechasdo</italic> (he shamed him) in public.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>lest he that heareth it &#x2018;y&#x2019;chasedcha&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1940">273</xref></sup> means &#x201C;lest he cause you shame upon your revealing the secret of another.&#x201D;</p>
<p><italic>And they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people</italic>. The intention thereof is as follows: &#x201C;You have done this secretly, but G-d will reveal your sin by bringing upon you a punishment before all the children of your people.&#x201D; He mentioned this with reference to a sin which is done in utmost secrecy, but it applies as well to all [sins punishable by] excision, as I have mentioned. <italic>He hath uncovered his sister&#x2019;s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity</italic>. This means that if he had uncovered his sister&#x2019;s nakedness against her will, he alone shall bear his iniquity, as Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented. But in my opinion the expression <italic>he hath uncovered his sister&#x2019;s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity</italic> means that each one of those mentioned [will bear the iniquity], just like the expression <italic>for he hath made naked his near kin; they shall bear their iniquity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1941">274</xref></sup></p>
<p>The correct interpretation of the word <italic>chesed</italic> [<italic>it is &#x2018;chesed&#x2019;</italic>] appears to me to be according to its plain sense [&#x201C;goodness,&#x201D; &#x201C;kindness&#x201D;]. So also is the opinion of our Rabbis.<sup><xref rid="fn1942">275</xref></sup> The verse is thus stating that the brother&#x2019;s kinship is kindness,<sup><xref rid="fn1943">276</xref></sup> and it is not proper for the uncovering of nakedness. Thus in the case of other relations Scripture mentions that the reason [for the prohibition of sexual intercourse] is because they are next of kin, but in the case of a brother [and sister] it mentions as the reason the kindness which should be among them. The word <italic>ish</italic> [<italic>and if &#x2018;a man&#x2019; shall take his sister</italic>] thus draws along with it a similar word [so that the expression <italic>it is &#x2018;chesed&#x2019;</italic> becomes &#x201C;it is <italic>ish chesed</italic>,&#x201D; meaning: &#x201C;it is a man who should have acted kindly to her, but he did the contrary, and hence his punishment is severe&#x201D;]. Or it may be that [the expression <italic>it is &#x2018;chesed&#x2019;</italic>] is like: <italic>and I am prayer</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1944">277</xref></sup> [which means: &#x201C;and I am &#x2018;a man of&#x2019; prayer&#x201D;<italic>; for thou art precious things</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1945">278</xref></sup> [which means: &#x201C;for thou art &#x2018;a man of&#x2019; precious things&#x201D;]<italic>; Behold, I am against thee, O arrogance</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1946">279</xref></sup> [which means: &#x201C;&#x2018;man of&#x2019; arrogance&#x201D;], in all of which cases the word <italic>ish</italic> (man) is missing [and here too that word is omitted, as if it were to say: &#x201C;it is <italic>ish chesed</italic>,&#x201D; as explained above]. Or it may be that Scripture in these cases refers to these men by their qualities [as if to say, &#x201C;kindness personifies the brother,&#x201D; &#x201C;I am all prayer,&#x201D; &#x201C;he is all preciousness,&#x201D; or &#x201C;arrogance personified&#x201D;. Thus Scripture is stating, <italic>And if a man shall take his sister &#x2026; and see her nakedness &#x2026; he is</italic> [to have been] <italic>the man of kindness, and they shall be cut off</italic>, for <italic>he hath uncovered his sister&#x2019;s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity</italic>. Thus He mentioned that the brother should have been <italic>the merciful man who doeth good to his own soul</italic>, but <italic>he was cruel and troubled his own flesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1947">280</xref></sup> For he should have done the kindness to her that brothers do, to give her in marriage to a husband, but he blemished and troubled her. Scripture ascribes the fault in such cases to the male, just as it is said, <italic>he hath uncovered his brother&#x2019;s</italic> [wife&#x2019;s] <italic>nakedness; they shall be childless</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1948">281</xref></sup> [and likewise here too it states, <italic>&#x2018;he&#x2019; hath uncovered his sister&#x2019;s nakedness</italic>]. Similarly it is my opinion that the expression, <italic>lest he that heareth it &#x2018;y&#x2019;chasedcha&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1940">273</xref></sup> means &#x201C;lest he that hears it will remove from you all kindness, because you have not shown kindness to your friend who entrusted you with his secret.&#x201D; [The word <italic>y&#x2019;chasedcha</italic> here meaning &#x201C;remove <italic>kindness</italic>&#x201D;] is like: <italic>l&#x2019;dashno</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1949">282</xref></sup> [the root of which <italic>deshen</italic> in its primary sense means &#x201C;to <italic>cover with</italic> ashes,&#x201D; but also has the opposite meaning of &#x201C;<italic>removing</italic> the ashes&#x201D;]<italic>; and all mine increase &#x2018;t&#x2019;shareish&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1950">283</xref></sup> [which, in its ordinary form, would mean &#x201C;to take root,&#x201D; but also has the opposite meaning of &#x201C;rooting out&#x201D;], and similar cases. [Likewise, <italic>y&#x2019;chasedcha</italic> which is of the root <italic>chesed</italic>, kindness, means in the verse quoted &#x201C;remove kindness,&#x201D; and does not mean &#x201C;shame.&#x201D;] For it appears to me unlikely that the word <italic>chesed</italic> in the Sacred Language should bear such opposite meanings [as &#x201C;kindness&#x201D; and &#x201C;shame&#x201D;], when Scriptural texts abound in the praise of <italic>chesed</italic> and use it in prayers. The term <italic>chisudo</italic>, however, in Aramaic is another matter. Even that language differentiates between the two usages; &#x201C;kindness&#x201D; is translated <italic>chisdo</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1951">284</xref></sup> and &#x201C;shame&#x201D; is translated <italic>chisudo</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1952">285</xref></sup> Now Rabbeinu Chananel<sup><xref rid="fn1953">286</xref></sup> wrote that <italic>&#x2018;chesed&#x2019; to any people is sin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1954">287</xref></sup> means &#x201C;reproach&#x201D; [i.e., that sin is &#x201C;a reproach&#x201D; to any people]. But in my opinion this too is an expression of contrast [as will be explained]. For &#x201C;righteousness&#x201D; and <italic>chesed</italic> are mentioned in that verse [thus: <italic>Righteousness exalteth a nation, but &#x2018;chesed&#x2019; to any people is sin</italic>], these being twin terms mentioned in all places, as for example: <italic>he that followeth after righteousness and &#x2018;chesed;&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1955">288</xref></sup> <italic>that I am the Eternal who exercises &#x2018;chesed,&#x2019; justice, and righteousness in the earth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1956">289</xref></sup> Rather, the meaning of the verse in my opinion is as follows: &#x201C;<italic>Righteousness</italic> if practiced <italic>exalteth a nation</italic>, but <italic>&#x2018;chesed&#x2019;</italic> (mercy, kindness) <italic>is a reproach to any people</italic> if it fails to practice it.&#x201D; Thus the verse is stating that upon righteousness and mercy depends the elevation or the decline of any people. Or it may be [that the verse is] stating: &#x201C;Righteousness exalts any individual nation that practices it, while many nations sin by their failure to do mercy.&#x201D; A similar example of such a verse is the one immediately preceding it: <italic>In the heart of him that hath discernment, wisdom resteth; but in the inward part of fools it maketh itself known</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1957">290</xref></sup> the meaning of which is that &#x201C;it makes itself known that [wisdom] is not there,&#x201D; for all who see them recognize by their deeds that they are fools <italic>and there is no understanding in them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1958">291</xref></sup> These two verses [thus express their thoughts in their second half] in a negative manner.<sup><xref rid="fn1959">292</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn1669">(2) Mizrachi on Rashi offers two explanations of this text: (a) Since the laws of this chapter are so fundamental, it was necessary for all the congregation to be present, so that if a doubt arises in anyone&#x2019;s mind as to precisely what Moses said, the other people can easily clarify it to him, which would not have been the case if the laws of this section were not declared to the full assembly. (b) Since these laws are so fundamental, men, women, and children were all present when Moses addressed them, whereas in the other sections of the Torah only the elders and the men were present.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1670">(3) Literally: &#x201C;the Law of the Priests,&#x201D; which is another name for the Book of Vayikra, or Leviticus. In other words, since the laws of this section are so fundamental to the entire congregation of Israel, why were they placed in the book which is essentially devoted to the laws of the priests and the offerings? The answer follows in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1671">(4) The Tur, quoting the language of Ramban, writes: &#x201C;peace-offerings.&#x201D; That is correct, since the following verses [5-8] refer only to the peace-offerings, and not the thanks-offering. There are important differences between them. A thanks-offering may be eaten only on the same day that it was slaughtered until midnight, whilst a peace-offering could be eaten for two days and the intervening night. Therefore Verses 6 and 7, speaking of permission to eat the offering for two days, could not possibly refer to the thanks-offering.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1737">(70) See Proverbs 30:10: <italic>Slander not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty</italic>. Ramban&#x2019;s intention is therefore as follows: Even in slandering a slave, where the slanderer runs the risk of incurring his curse, the master nonetheless gives the slanderer no assurance that he will listen to him, and so what sense is there to this &#x201C;eating&#x201D; on the part of the slanderer which Rashi mentioned?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1738">(71) This refers back to the proof Rashi mentioned above from the Book of Daniel 3:8, where it is said <italic>&#x2018;va&#x2019;achalu kartzeihon&#x2019; of the Jews</italic>, and it is told that certain slanderers came and informed Nebuchadnezzar that Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, were not bowing to his image of gold. As a result he called them and asked them if it was true. When they told him that they had no intention ever of bowing to his image of gold, he had them thrown into a burning furnace. But when they were saved by an act of G-d from the fiery furnace, the king had it proclaimed that no one must henceforth speak against the G-d of these righteous ones. &#x2014; Ramban now points out that when accepting the words of the slanderers, we find no reference to the king&#x2019;s offering them any food, a custom which Rashi mentioned as having been the basis for this expression <italic>va&#x2019;achalu kartzeihon</italic>. Furthermore, as is evidenced from the story, he did not even believe them at first, for he called Hananiah etc. and asked about it. And yet Scripture says <italic>&#x2018;va&#x2019;achalu kartzeihon&#x2019; of the Jews</italic>, which shows that this whole interpretation of Rashi in Onkelos&#x2019; translation of the verse is not borne out by Scripture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1739">(72) Daniel 3:14. Shadrach, Meshach, etc. were the Babylonian names that the chief of officers gave to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah (<italic>ibid.</italic>, 1:7).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1742">(75) In other words, in the same verse where their punishment is mentioned (<italic>ibid.</italic>,) it refers to them as <italic>those men that &#x2018;achalu kartzohi&#x2019; of Daniel</italic>, which shows that it was not a meal that the king offered them, but quite the contrary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1743">(76) Baba Bathra 5 a. The story there is told that Ravina had land on all four sides of a field belonging to a man called Runya. When Ravina put up a fence on all four sides separating his fields from that of Runya, the latter refused to pay his share of the expense. Thereupon Ravina at the time of the harvest said to his field laborer, &#x201C;Bring me a cluster of grapes from Runya&#x2019;s field when he is present there.&#x201D; When he was about to do it Runya rebuked him, shouting, &#x201C;Put it back.&#x201D; Ravina then said to Runya: &#x201C;Now you have shown that you are satisfied with the fence I have made. Even if only goats came into your field, would you not need to shout at them? Would you not need to hire a person to shout at them? [Hence you must share in the expense of the fence].&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1752">(85) Genesis 21:25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1753">(86) Baba Metzia 62 a. This teaching applies to a case where &#x201C;two people are together on a journey and one has a pitcher of water; if they both drink from it they will die, because there is not enough for both, but if only one will drink he will survive. Ben Petura taught that it is better that both should drink and die, rather than that one should see the death of the other. [This was held to be the law] until Rabbi Akiba came and taught: <italic>that thy brother may live with thee</italic> (further, 25:36), thy life takes precedence over the life of thy brother.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1754">(87) Thus: &#x201C;he is to speak in praise of his neighbor, and be as careful of his neighbor&#x2019;s property as he is careful of his own property, and be as solicitous of his neighbor&#x2019;s honor as he is of his own&#x201D; (Rambam, Mishneh Torah, <italic>Hilchoth Mada</italic>, 6:3).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1755">(88) In that case the command would have been to love the <italic>person</italic> of one&#x2019;s neighbor as much as one loves one&#x2019;s own self. But instead the verse says <italic>l&#x2019;rei&#x2019;acha</italic>, which means &#x201C;to [or &#x2018;for&#x2019;] your neighbor,&#x201D; thus teaching that that which is good &#x201C;for&#x201D; your neighbor you should love as if it were good for youself.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1762">(95) And so why did Rashi mention this prohibition of mating diverse kinds of cattle, as an example of a &#x201C;statute.&#x201D; when the Rabbis never mentioned it as such?</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1765">(98) Kiddushin 39 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1766">(99) This interpretation is based upon the fact that Scripture states, <italic>thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind; thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed</italic>. By placing these two prohibitions together, Scripture is teaching that just as in the case of cattle, the verse refers to well-definable objects [cattle], so in the case of sowing the field, Scripture refers to well-definable objects &#x2014; trees, vegetables, etc., &#x2014; and is not a mere prohibition against sowing diverse kinds of seed [although that too is forbidden], since these are not yet distinguishable.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1768">(101) This reason is also stated by Maimonides in the Guide of the Perplexed, III, 49 (p. 267 in Friedlander&#x2019;s translation).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1769">(102) This thought which appears in the following text is expressly mentioned in the commentary on the Songs of Songs ascribed to Ramban but actually authored by Rabbi Ezra, one of the chief Cabalists of the period (see my introduction to this book in Kithvei Haramban, Vol. II, p. 474). Ramban&#x2019;s expression here &#x201C;and one of our colleagues etc.&#x201D; thus clearly indicates that there was a group of scholars in Gerona who were dedicated to the study of the Cabala; and Ramban was one of that group. &#x2014; Several points worthy of note are to be made with this expression &#x201C;one of our colleagues.&#x201D; It indicates the reticence with which the study of Cabala was regarded at that time. For even when crediting the thought to another scholar Ramban avoids identifying him by name. The role of Rabbi Ezra as one of the leading Cabalists at that period is indeed an undefined one, although it is known for a certainty that his influence was far-reaching. Additionally, the term <italic>chaveireinu</italic> (our colleague) indicates the closeness with which the group kept together, so that anyone who was part of them was called a <italic>chaveir</italic> (a colleague). The expression &#x201C;one of our colleagues&#x201D; may perhaps also indicate that Rabbi Ezra and Ramban were regarded as equals, for otherwise he would have referred to him as a teacher or master.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1783">(116) Menachoth 39 a. To understand the following text it is necessary to clarify these two points: (a) The commandment of <italic>Tzitzith</italic> (Fringes) consists of making for each of the four corners of the garment four threads specially woven for that purpose. They are then passed through a hole situated a few thumbs&#x2019; breadth away from each of the four corners, the threads are doubled, and two knots are then formed at the lower edge of the garment, followed by a series of windings and other double knots (see &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, p. 22, for precise details). (b) A cardinal principle in Torah law is that, subject to certain general exceptions, any duty of fulfilling a positive commandment overrides a negative commandment (see Ramban on Exodus 20:8 &#x2014; Vol. II, pp. 309-310). This is derived from the juxtaposition of these two verses: <italic>Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together. Thou shalt make twisted cords upon the four corners of thy covering, wherewith thou coverest thyself</italic> (Deuteronomy 22:11-12). The closeness of the two verses intimates that the commandment of Fringes overrides the prohibition of <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic>, so that the Fringes may be made with threads of wool even if the garment itself is of linen. &#x2014; The Gemara now argues on the basis of the second principle mentioned, that we must say that the upper knots [formed at the lower edge of the garment] after the four threads are passed through the opening and doubled, are obligatory by law of the Torah, &#x201C;for should you think etc.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1784">(117) I.e., from the fact that the Torah intimated a special permission showing that the commandment of the Fringes overrides the prohibition of wearing <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic> (see Note 116 (b)).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1785">(118) &#x201C;Knots.&#x201D; The Hebrew is <italic>kesher</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;knot&#x201D; in the singular. But Ramban himself further on refers to &#x201C;two knots&#x201D; which are made at the lower edge of the garment. Basically, however, it is the first knot with which we are concerned, since if the threads are of wool and the garment of linen, and they are joined together with only one knot, which holds them together, nonetheless the prohibition of <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic> would be incurred by wearing them afterwards, were it not for the fact that in that case the Torah especially permitted it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1786">(119) Hence if the commandment of the Fringes required merely the passing of the four threads through the hole, and then doubling them, without tying them with a knot, there would have been no need for the Torah to intimate a special permission for <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic> in Fringes, since the woolen threads and linen garment would not be considered &#x201C;joined together.&#x201D; But if, on the other hand, after the threads are passed through the opening and are doubled they must then be tied with a knot, that constitutes already an act of joining the woolen Fringes and the linen garment together, which ordinarily would render it forbidden to be worn, and then we would understand that in the case of the Fringes, the Torah had to intimate a special permission. &#x2014; Thus far is the reasoning of the Talmud. Ramban now deduces from it, that in order to be included in the prohibition of <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic> it is not necessary that the wool and linen themselves be combed, spun and twisted together, as Rashi had written.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1787">(120) Deuteronomy 22:10. Now just as in this case the prohibition applies to joining together in work an ox and an ass, which are two separate creatures, even so in the verse on <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic> which follows, the prohibition applies only where the <italic>thread</italic> of wool was treated to all three actions separately, and so also the <italic>thread</italic> of linen, and then they were both <italic>joined</italic> together.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1788">(121) Kilayim 9:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1789">(122) Meaning: &#x201C;<italic>naloz</italic> (he preverses) <italic>umeiliez</italic> (and turns) his Father in heaven against him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>, 9:8). &#x201C;The word <italic>nuz</italic> is thus an expression of perverseness and crookedness, similar to the twisting of threads with each other. It is for this reason that the Merciful One had to permit expressly <italic>kilayim</italic> in Fringes, since in the case of the Fringes the threads must be twisted&#x201D; (Ramban in his commentary to Tractate Niddah, 61b).

<ftnote id="fn1794">(127) In our text of the Mishnah: &#x201C;Rabbi Shimon the son of Elazar.&#x201D; Ramban&#x2019;s version, however, suggests that it is Rabbi Shimon the son of Yochai, who is always referred to as &#x201C;Rabbi Shimon&#x201D; without further qualification.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1798">(131) Sanhedrin 41 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1799">(132) In our text of the Gemara: <italic>minezihuthei</italic>, which Rashi explains as meaning: &#x201C;if you had wanted &#x2018;to rail at us&#x2019; we could not have answered you at all. But as you spoke kindly, we will tell you many things that we have said about it.&#x201D; Ramban will explain the text before us [which conforms to the reading of the Munich Talmud manuscript] as meaning: &#x201C;if you had wanted to turn away the matter from the right course etc.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1800">(133) See above, Note 116 (b). Ramban&#x2019;s intention is that although the woolen <italic>Fringes</italic> are not plaited or woven together with the <italic>cloth</italic> of the four-cornered garment, to which they are later attached, nonetheless since the Fringes are <italic>themselves</italic> combed, spun and twisted, and then attached to the cloth which was likewise combed, spun and twisted, as explained above, that is a sufficient &#x201C;mingling of stuffs&#x201D; to constitute <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic>. Hence it was necessary for the Torah to grant permission etc.,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1801">(134) Even though the woolen edging is not woven together with the linen garment, but is merely attached to it by some artificial means (Tifereth Yisrael, Kilayim 9:9, Note 46).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1802">(135) In summary then, two major differences of opinion have appeared between Rashi and Ramban on the law of <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz:</italic> (a) According to Rashi the Scriptural prohibition applies where the wool and linen were <italic>either</italic> combed, <italic>or</italic> spun, <italic>or</italic> twisted. Hence felted stuff which is only combed, is forbidden by law of the Torah. According to Ramban, the Scriptural prohibition applies only where the wool and linen went through the process of all three acts mentioned, and therefore felted stuff which is only combed, is forbidden only by enactment of the Rabbis. (b) According to Rashi the prohibition of <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic> applies where the wool and linen were combed [or spun or twisted] <italic>together</italic>. According to Ramban, the prohibition applies where the <italic>threads</italic> of wool were separately combed, spun and twisted, and likewise the <italic>threads</italic> of linen were combed, spun and twisted, and then they were both attached to each other with a minimum of two stitches, or tied with a knot. &#x2014; Rambam&#x2019;s presentation of this law follows that of Rashi, while the Rashba follows that of Ramban.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1873">(206) For otherwise why did the Torah use two different terms: <italic>seiva</italic> (the hoary head) and <italic>zakein</italic> (the old man)? Onkelos thus reasoned that since <italic>zakein</italic> definitely means &#x201C;he who has acquired wisdom,&#x201D; it shows that <italic>seiva</italic> must mean all kinds of old people, whether learned or not learned. Hence in translating the verse he rendered <italic>zakein</italic> first and then <italic>seiva</italic>, although in the Hebrew text the order of the terms is the opposite. In short, then, it may be that Onkelos also agrees with the opinion of Isi the son of Yehudah that one must show honor to all kinds of old people, whether aged in the knowledge of the Torah or just aged in years.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1893">(226) If Molech is held to have been an idol, then, as explained in Ramban above, there was no need for the Torah to prohibit and punish its practice specifically, since it was included in the many general prohibitions against idolatry. We were therefore forced to say that the reason why the Torah specifically mentioned Molech and its practice, was to prohibit that practice to any idol, even if that particular idol was not normally worshipped in that way. Also, the term &#x201C;Molech&#x201D; must be an expression not for a particular idol, but for any idol, the word being of the root <italic>malchuth</italic> (royalty), as the act of idol worship meant that the idolator accepted the idol as his god. But if Molech is held to have been a form of witchcraft [and not a mode of idol worship], then if one is to perform that practice before Peor or Merkulis, it would not come under that specific prohibition which the Torah singled out, and hence he would be free from the punishment of death, although &#x2014; needless to state &#x2014; he has committed a heinous sin.</ftnote>

<h1>21</h1>
<p>1. SAY [UNTO THE PRIESTS] &#x2026; AND THOU SHALT SAY UNTO THEM. &#x201C;[The repetition of the verb <italic>say &#x2026; and thou shalt say</italic> is] to warn the adults about the children&#x201D; [that they observe this law]. This is Rashi&#x2019;s language on the basis of the words of our Rabbis.<sup><xref rid="fn1960">1</xref></sup> Now the meaning of this &#x201C;warning&#x201D; is to state that we are not to assist with our hands in the defilement of children [but it does not intend to warn us that we are obliged to prevent them from becoming defiled]. There are many admonitions in the Torah of this nature according to the interpretation of our Rabbis,<sup><xref rid="fn1960">1</xref></sup> such being the prohibitions against eating blood and swarming things, and against the defilement [of priests], and from them we learn that [it is applicable to] all prohibitions of the Torah, that we must not assist children in any case to transgress the law. But if they are doing it of their own accord, we<sup><xref rid="fn1961">2</xref></sup> are not commanded to prevent them [from so doing since they have not yet reached the training period of minors for religious practices, but if they have reached that stage, everyone is commanded to prevent them from doing a prohibited act].<sup><xref rid="fn1962">3</xref></sup> The meaning of the verse according to its interpretation is then: &#x201C;<italic>say unto the priests &#x2026; and thou shalt say</italic> it over again to them, that they are not to defile themselves,&#x201D; the purpose of the many warnings being [to teach] that all sons of Aaron are to be guarded from defilement, even the young ones. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said by way of the plain meaning of Scripture, that <italic>say unto the priests</italic> refers to the section mentioned above [i.e., <italic>Seder Kedoshim</italic>], since they [the priests] are the teachers of the Torah and it is they who admonish the people; <italic>and thou shalt say unto them</italic>, meaning those specific commandments which devolve upon them alone to observe, [as mentioned in this section]. But it is not correct [to interpret two such adjacent phrases as referring to two different sections].</p>
<p>In my opinion the plain sense of the verse is as follows: The meaning of <italic>emor</italic> (say) is like that of <italic>dabeir</italic> (speak): <italic>Give ear to &#x2018;amarai,&#x2019;</italic> O Eternal<sup><xref rid="fn1963">4</xref></sup> is like <italic>d&#x2019;varai</italic> (my words). A similar case is <italic>&#x2018;imrei&#x2019;</italic>(<italic>words of</italic>) <italic>truth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1964">5</xref></sup> So also: <italic>for it hath heard all &#x2018;imrei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the words of</italic>) <italic>the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1965">6</xref></sup> And the expression <italic>Go in unto Pharaoh &#x2018;v&#x2019;dibarta&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and thou shalt speak</italic>) <italic>to him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1966">7</xref></sup> is like <italic>v&#x2019;amarta</italic> (and thou shalt say). <italic>&#x2018;Vayedabeir Mosheh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>And Moses spoke</italic>) <italic>unto Aaron, and unto Elazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left: &#x2018;Take the meal-offering</italic>,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1967">8</xref></sup> is like <italic>vayomer Mosheh</italic> (<italic>and Moses said</italic>). And so also you find in many places that both [<italic>amor</italic> and <italic>dabeir</italic> are used in one verse, such as: ] <italic>&#x2018;Dabeir</italic> (<italic>Speak</italic>) <italic>unto the children of Israel, &#x2018;v&#x2019;amarta&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and say</italic>) <italic>unto them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1968">9</xref></sup> such usage [of the two verbs] being found in those sections where He wishes to warn them strongly [about a certain law] either because of the stringency of the matter, or on account of their habit to commit that sin. Thus <italic>&#x2018;emor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>say</italic>) <italic>unto the priests &#x2026; &#x2018;v&#x2019;amarta&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and thou shalt say</italic>) <italic>unto them</italic> [is like <italic>&#x2018;dabeir&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>speak unto the priests</italic>) <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;amarta&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and thou shalt say</italic>), as will be explained further on]. Similarly, <italic>Thus saith the Eternal, the G-d of Israel: Go &#x2018;v&#x2019;amarta&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and say</italic>) <italic>to Zedekiah king of Judah &#x2018;v&#x2019;amarta&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and say</italic>) <italic>unto him: Thus saith the Eternal</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1969">10</xref></sup> means &#x201C;Go <italic>dabeir</italic> (speak) to Zedekiah.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>&#x2018;Vatomer ha&#x2019;ishah ha&#x2019;t&#x2019;ko&#x2019;ith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>And when the woman of Tekoa said</italic>) <italic>to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and prostrated herself, &#x2018;vatomer&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and she said</italic>)<italic>: &#x2018;Help, O king&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1970">11</xref></sup> is like: &#x201C;<italic>vatedabei&#x2019;r ha&#x2019;ishah</italic> (<italic>and the woman spoke</italic>) to the king <italic>vatomer</italic> (<italic>and she said</italic>), &#x2018;Help, O king.&#x2019; &#x201D; The meaning of <italic>Say unto the priests &#x2026; and thou shalt say unto them</italic> is thus like &#x201C;speak to the priests and say to them,&#x201D; similar to [that which we find elsewhere], <italic>&#x2018;Dabeir&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>speak</italic>) <italic>unto the children of Israel, &#x2018;v&#x2019;amarta&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and say</italic>) <italic>unto them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1968">9</xref></sup> the meaning thereof being: &#x201C;speak to the people in My Name, and say thus to them,&#x201D; like, <italic>Go in unto Pharaoh, and say unto him:</italic> [<italic>&#x2018;Thus saith the Eternal: Let My people go&#x2019;</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1971">12</xref></sup> Now many scholars<sup><xref rid="fn1972">13</xref></sup> say that the meaning of <italic>&#x2018;dabeir&#x2019; unto the children of Israel</italic> is like that of the term <italic>kriah</italic> (calling), thus: &#x201C;call unto the children of Israel that they assemble themselves before you, and you shall say to them the following,&#x201D; and similarly <italic>&#x2018;emor&#x2019; to the priests</italic> means [&#x201C;call them] to assemble themselves and to listen.&#x201D;</p>
<p>[SAY UNTO] THE PRIESTS. The reason for [His mentioning the term] <italic>the priests</italic> [in this section is as follows]: In commandments relating to matters of the offerings He says, <italic>Command Aaron and his sons</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1973">14</xref></sup> and does not refer to them by the name &#x201C;the priests,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1974">15</xref></sup> because those subjects concern the offerings or the various degrees of holiness of the Sanctuary. But here He warns the priests that they should never defile themselves for the dead, even at a time when they do not come into the Sanctuary, this being a mark of distinction to them personally; therefore Scripture mentioned here <italic>the priests</italic>, meaning to say that it is because they are the priests of the Eternal and the ministers of our G-d that He told them to conduct themselves in a manner reflecting honor and greatness, and that they should never become defiled. Thus the priests who are unfit for the priesthood [i.e., those who are born from a marriage forbidden to their father], are excluded from this principle [i.e., they are permitted to defile themselves for the dead].</p>
<p>The explanation of <italic>&#x2018;lo yitama&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he shall not defile himself</italic> &#x2014; in the singular) is that you [i.e., Moses] are to tell the priests that none of them is to defile himself for the dead among his people. Or it may be that [the use of the singular in <italic>lo yitama</italic>] is connected with the expression of <italic>&#x2018;ba&#x2019;al b&#x2019;amav&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a chief man among his people</italic>) mentioned below in Scripture,<sup><xref rid="fn1975">16</xref></sup> and the meaning thereof [here] is: &#x201C;the chief man among his people is not to defile himself [for the dead].&#x201D; And the meaning of <italic>ba&#x2019;al b&#x2019;amav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1975">16</xref></sup> is like the expressions: <italic>&#x2018;miba&#x2019;alei Yehudah;&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1976">17</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;ba&#x2019;aleigoyim,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1977">18</xref></sup> namely &#x201C;the dignitaries&#x201D; or &#x201C;the lords&#x201D; among them [i.e., Judah<sup><xref rid="fn1976">17</xref></sup> and the nations<sup><xref rid="fn1977">18</xref></sup>], similar to the phrase: <italic>&#x2018;ba&#x2019;alav ein imo&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1978">19</xref></sup> &#x2014; &#x201C;the master is not with it; &#x201D; <italic>&#x2018;ba&#x2019;al habayith&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;the master of the house; &#x201D; as honored people are called &#x201C;lords.&#x201D; The verse here is thus stating: &#x201C;the honored one among his people [i.e., the priest] is not to defile himself for the dead, [in which case] he would be treating his honor with irreverence.&#x201D; Scripture is thus explaining that it is because of the distinction of the priest, seeing that he is fit to become the highest and most honored one among his people [i.e., the High Priest] that it warns him not to profane his distinction with the impurity of the dead. By means of this statement, Scripture intends to teach us that it should not occur to us to say that the warning [against the priests defiling themselves for the dead] is only when they come into the Tent of Meeting to perform the holy Service. Similarly in this whole section He states that all restrictions [on the priests mentioned here] are due to their distinction. Thus: <italic>she profaneth her father;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1979">20</xref></sup> <italic>and he shall not profane his seed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1980">21</xref></sup> Onkelos likewise translated [Verse 4]: &#x201C;The chief among his people shall not defile himself, to be profaned thereby.&#x201D; But in the Torath Kohanim<sup><xref rid="fn1981">22</xref></sup> [<italic>ba&#x2019;al b&#x2019;amav</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn1975">16</xref></sup> is interpreted [literally] to refer to &#x201C;a husband&#x201D; with reference to his wife, as Rashi has written.<sup><xref rid="fn1982">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. THEY SHALL BE HOLY UNTO THEIR G-D. Holiness signifies separateness, as I have explained in the section above.<sup><xref rid="fn1983">24</xref></sup> Scripture is thus stating that even in those things which are permissible to Israelites, the priests should exercise self-control, avoiding the impurity of the dead, and marrying of women who are unfit for them in purity and cleanliness.</p>
<p>8. FOR I THE ETERNAL, WHO SANCTIFY YOU, AM HOLY. The sense [of the plural form of <italic>you</italic>] is that it is addressed to the priests, just as He began, <italic>Say unto the priests</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1984">25</xref></sup> Or it may be that the expression <italic>I the Eternal, Who sanctify you</italic> means &#x201C;Who sanctifies all of you &#x2014; priests and [the rest of the] people,&#x201D; and the meaning thereof is as follows: &#x201C;Since the priest offers &#x2018;the bread&#x2019; of your G-d, <italic>he shall be holy unto thee</italic>, for through him I sanctify all of you and make My <italic>Shechinah</italic> (Divine Glory) dwell in your Sanctuary.&#x201D; It is possible by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala] that the above phrase refers back to the beginning of [this] verse,<sup><xref rid="fn1985">26</xref></sup> a matter which has already been explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1986">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. HE SHALL NOT LET THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD GO LOOSE etc. 11. NEITHER SHALL HE GO IN TO ANY DEAD BODY. The phrase [dealing with his hair, in Verse 10], is connected with <italic>any dead body</italic> in the following verse, thus stating that the High Priest is not to let his hair go loose nor rend his garments <italic>for any dead body</italic>, neither is he to enter a tent where there is a corpse.</p>
<p>12. NEITHER SHALL HE GO OUT OF THE SANCTUARY. &#x201C;He does not follow the bier [of a near relative]. Our Rabbis have further derived from this verse [the principle] that the High Priest may perform [the Divine Service] when he is an <italic>onen</italic> (a mourner),<sup><xref rid="fn1987">28</xref></sup> the meaning of the verse thus being as follows: Even if his father or his mother died, he need not leave the Sanctuary but he may perform the Service. <italic>Nor shall he profane the Sanctuary of his G-d</italic>, means that [the High Priest] does not profane thereby the Service by ministering when he is an <italic>onen</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1987">28</xref></sup> since Scripture permitted him to minister. From this you deduce that a common priest who officiated when he is an <italic>onen</italic>, does profane the Service.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>But these two interpretations [that Rashi mentioned, namely, that the High Priest is not to follow the bier of a near relative, and that he may officiate when he is an <italic>onen</italic>], are really opposing opinions, for since the verse <italic>permitted</italic> the High Priest not to leave the Sanctuary on account of his mourning, as a common priest must do, but instead he may [continue to] officiate when he is an <italic>onen</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1987">28</xref></sup> then there is <italic>no admonition here</italic> against his following the bier of his near relative.<sup><xref rid="fn1988">29</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>nor shall he profane the Sanctuary of his G-d</italic> is, according to this interpretation [of Rashi], nothing but a statement that the Service of the High Priest does not become profaned [although performed when he is an <italic>onen</italic>], from which you are to deduce that a common priest who officiates when he is an <italic>onen</italic>, does defile the Service. But if so, this verse is merely a negation, not a prohibition, and yet the &#x201C;masters of the <italic>Halachoth</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1989">30</xref></sup> counted it among the negative commandments in the Hilchoth Gedoloth&#x0021; Moreover, I have already quoted the Beraitha<sup><xref rid="fn1990">31</xref></sup> which is taught in the Torath Kohanim<sup><xref rid="fn1991">32</xref></sup> where it is clearly explained that this verse is a proper prohibition [and not a mere negation], as it is taught: &#x201C;<italic>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1992">33</xref></sup> I might think that [upon becoming apprised of the death of a near relative, an ordinary priest may not leave the Sanctuary] whether he is ministering or not; Scripture therefore says, <italic>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor shall he profane</italic>. When is he not permitted to go out [so that only by his staying there] he does not profane it? I must say that this applies only when he is ministering.&#x201D; And it further states there [in the Torath Kohanim ]:<sup><xref rid="fn1993">34</xref></sup> &#x201C;I would only know that this tells me that Aaron and his sons, who were anointed with the oil of anointment, are liable to death [by the hand of Heaven] if they leave the Sanctuary while they are ministering. How do I know that this [prohibition] applies also to all priests of all times? etc.&#x201D; Thus it is clear that the verse before us constitutes an actual negative commandment, prohibiting the priest from leaving the Service and going out [of the Sanctuary].</p>
<p>Therefore I say in order to maintain the words of all the Sages [i.e., of Rashi and of the author of the Hilchoth Gedoloth, as will be explained], that the main purpose of this verse is to admonish the High Priest not to leave the Sanctuary while he is ministering, on [becoming apprised of] the death of any near relative, and he is not to profane the Sanctuary by leaving its Service for the honor of the dead. Instead, the honor of the Sanctuary and its Service is to be greater to him than his honor of and love for the dead, and it follows all the more so that if he left his ministration for no reason at all, and went out of the Sanctuary, that he has violated this negative commandment. However, Scripture warned him with [especial] reference to the dead, in order [incidentally] to permit the High Priest to perform the Service when he is an <italic>onen</italic> (a mourner),<sup><xref rid="fn1987">28</xref></sup> and since it is permissible for him to perform it, therefore if he leaves it voluntarily it constitutes a profanation of the Sanctuary. This is the meaning of this verse, and I have already written it in the section of <italic>Vay&#x2019;hi Bayom Ha&#x2019;shemini</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1994">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>We find furthermore that our Rabbis have differed in the second chapter of Tractate Zebachim [on this matter, namely whether the verse before us is a prohibition, or a mere negation]. Thus they have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1995">36</xref></sup> &#x201C;How do we know that an <italic>onen</italic> [who performs] profanes the Service? Because it is written, <italic>Neither shall he</italic> [i.e., the High Priest] <italic>go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane;</italic> but any other priest who does not go out [of the Sanctuary], does profane it [i.e., if he officiates when he is an <italic>onen</italic>]. And Rabbi Ilai<sup><xref rid="fn1996">37</xref></sup> said, We derive it from this verse: <italic>Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1997">38</xref></sup> &#x2014; it is &#x2018;I&#x2019; [Aaron &#x2014; the High Priest] who offered&#x0021; From this you may learn that if they [Aaron&#x2019;s sons &#x2014; Elazar and Ithamar] had performed the rites of the offerings, they would have acted correctly [in burning them, since common priests who minister when in a state of <italic>aninuth</italic> (mourning) invalidate the Service] etc. And Rabbi Ilai, why does he not derive this principle from the verse, <italic>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane?</italic> He will answer you: Is it after all written, &#x2018;But any other priest who does not go out of the Sanctuary does profane it&#x2019;?&#x201D; The meaning of [Rabbi Ilai&#x2019;s answer] is that since Scripture states an admonition with reference to the High Priest, that he is not to leave the Sanctuary and that he should not profane the Service by leaving it [on becoming apprised of the death of a near relative], there is no implication here that a common priest <italic>does</italic> profane the Service if he officiates when he is an <italic>onen</italic> [and hence Rabbi Ilai resorted to another verse &#x2014; <italic>Behold, this day</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1997">38</xref></sup> &#x2014; from which he learned that a common priest who is an <italic>onen</italic> profanes the Service]. From this text, then, there is another proof that it is not [merely] a permission [that the Torah extended] to the High Priest, permitting him to perform the Service, and informing him that his ministration will not become profaned [as Rashi had stated it], for if that were the case, it <italic>would</italic> surely have followed that a common priest does profane it by ministering [when he is an <italic>onen</italic>]. Thus it appears from the interpretation of the text,<sup><xref rid="fn1998">39</xref></sup> that according to the opinion of the first answer [stated above, that we know that an <italic>onen</italic> profanes the Service from the verse about the High Priest, <italic>Neither shall he go out</italic> etc., which teaches by implication: &#x201C;but any other priest who does not go out, does profane it&#x201D;], it constitutes a mere negation as far as the High Priest is concerned,<sup><xref rid="fn1999">40</xref></sup> [to teach us] that he does not profane his Service [and invalidate it if he officiates whilst he is an <italic>onen</italic>], as is the language of Rashi. However, because in the Beraitha [quoted above] it is clearly stated that it is an admonition [an opinion held by the Hilchoth Gedoloth], we shall say that they<sup><xref rid="fn2000">41</xref></sup> hold that since the admonition pertains only to the High Priest, and by implication we reason that a common priest does go out [of the Sanctuary] and leave the ministration, from this we learn that [if the common priest would continue ministering], the Service would be profaned, for if it would have been valid, [the Torah] would not have permitted him to leave it. And so it is taught in the Torath Kohanim in this section:<sup><xref rid="fn2001">42</xref></sup> &#x201C;How do we know that if [the High Priest] officiates [whilst he is an <italic>onen</italic>] that his Service is valid? Because Scripture says, <italic>Nor shall he profane</italic>. But if a common priest officiates whilst in mourning, his Service <italic>is</italic> invalid.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now as to the text written in Tractate Sanhedrin:<sup><xref rid="fn2002">43</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Neither shall he go out &#x2018;min hamikdash&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>of the Sanctuary</italic>) &#x2014; this means that he may not follow after the bier with the bearers, but [he may go forth with them as long as they do not see one another, thus: ] when they [who form the funeral cortege] are hidden [from his view, as when entering an alley], he [the High Priest] appears; when they emerge, he disappears [in the alley]. These are the words of Rabbi Meir. But Rabbi Yehudah says: He may not go forth from the Sanctuary at all, for it is said, <italic>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary</italic>. &#x201D; And [in the Gemara there] the Rabbis explained that the reason of Rabbi Meir is that he interprets the verse as follows: &#x201C; <italic>&#x2018;u&#x2019;min hamikdash</italic> &#x2014; out of his sanctity &#x2014; he shall not go forth,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2003">44</xref></sup> and as long as he has some distinction [to remind him not to defile himself, namely, the fact that he is not in sight of the funeral cortege], he will not come to touch the dead. And Rabbi Yehudah [is of the opinion that] on account of his grief, he might by chance touch it.&#x201D; [Now this whole text would seem to indicate that the verse before us is an admonition whose purpose is to guard the sanctity of the High Priest, and not, as we have said above, that its purpose is to guard the sanctity of the Service&#x0021;] However, all this is merely a Scriptural support for a Rabbinic ordinance. It is they [i.e., the Rabbis] who [decided to] guard the dignity of the High Priest, that he should not go out after the bier, because he is not permitted to defile himself for near relatives; and since people are upset about their dead, [they feared] lest he will touch it, similar to that which is written, <italic>And Joseph fell upon his father&#x2019;s face</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2004">45</xref></sup> But a common priest must defile himself for his near relatives, and he is not so upset about other people that there is a fear lest he defile himself; [therefore there was no need for the Rabbis to institute a restriction against a common priest following the funeral cortege of people other than his near relatives]. Thus it is clear that all this is a mark of distinction [for the High Priest] by law of the Rabbis, and they gave it support by reference to this verse, as is the manner of <italic>asmachtoth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2005">46</xref></sup> in the Talmud. So also have I found in the Tosephta of Sanhedrin:<sup><xref rid="fn2006">47</xref></sup> &#x201C;The Sages said to Rabbi Yehudah: The verse <italic>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary</italic>, only refers to his leaving the Sanctuary at the time of ministration.&#x201D; There are also proofs in the Talmud Yerushalmi there,<sup><xref rid="fn2007">48</xref></sup> [to the correctness of this explanation], but this is not the place to mention them.<sup><xref rid="fn2008">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND HE SHALL TAKE A WIFE IN HER VIRGINITY. This means that he is not to wed a woman who is not a virgin, this being a negative commandment which is derived from a positive commandment [which carries the force of a positive commandment].<sup><xref rid="fn2009">50</xref></sup> Afterwards [in the following verse] He forbids the High Priest by means of a negative commandment to marry a widow or other disqualified woman, and then says, <italic>but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2010">51</xref></sup> thus commanding him [in a positive manner] to take a virgin as a wife. It is this which our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2011">52</xref></sup> &#x201C;He is forbidden [to marry] a widow, and he is commanded to marry a virgin.&#x201D; And so the Rabbis taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn2012">53</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>But a virgin</italic>. This teaches that he is commanded to marry a virgin.&#x201D;</p>
<p>15. AND HE SHALL NOT PROFANE HIS SEED AMONG HIS PEOPLE. &#x201C;Thus if he married one of these women who are disqualified for him, his offspring from her becomes profaned [i.e., disqualified] from the law of the sanctity of the priesthood.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>The Rabbi [Rashi] thus explained the verse [before us] as a mere negation, meaning: &#x201C;<italic>these shall he not take</italic> in order that he profane not his offspring.&#x201D; But in the opinion of our Rabbis, this constitutes a second negative commandment. Thus they have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2013">54</xref></sup> &#x201C;If [a High Priest or a common priest] betrothed and had intercourse with one of the women disqualified to him, he is subject to two penalties of whipping, once on account of <italic>he shall not take</italic>, and again on account of <italic>he shall not profane</italic>.&#x201D; And the Rabbis have also said there: &#x201C;If he has intercourse without betrothal, he is liable to whipping on account of <italic>he shall not profane</italic>.&#x201D; Thus it is clear that these are two negative commandments. They have also explained there the reason why, for [mere] betrothal without [subsequent] intercourse, he is not liable to whipping, because [Scripture says: <italic>he shall not take &#x2026; he shall not profane</italic>, meaning: ] Why must he not take [her as his wife]? &#x201C;In order that he may not profane&#x201D; [his offspring, and therefore if the marriage was not consummated, and he can have no offspring from her, he is not liable merely for the betrothal]. If so, the meaning of the expression, <italic>these shall he not take</italic>, is &#x201C;because I [the Eternal] admonish him against profaning his seed,&#x201D; and from this statement we ourselves deduce that his offspring from one of the disqualified women is profaned, [rendered unfit for the priesthood].</p>
<p>17. SPEAK UNTO AARON, SAYING: WHOSOEVER HE BE OF THY SEED THROUGHOUT THEIR GENERATIONS. He does not state here &#x201C;speak unto Aaron and his sons&#x201D; as He does in all [other] sections,<sup><xref rid="fn2014">55</xref></sup> because there in the Scriptural portions He commanded the laws of the offerings: <italic>This is the law of the burnt-offering;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2014">55</xref></sup> <italic>This is the law of the sin-offering</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2015">56</xref></sup> and <italic>of the guilt-offering</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2016">57</xref></sup> and so on [and these laws apply to all priests &#x2014; Aaron and his sons alike]. But here, if He were to have said &#x201C;Speak unto Aaron and his sons,&#x201D; He would have had to continue by saying: &#x201C;Whosoever <italic>of you</italic> be throughout your generations&#x201D; [which would have included Aaron among priests that might have a blemish, which this section discusses], and He did not want to warn Aaron himself about the law of blemishes, because <italic>Aaron the holy one of the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2017">58</xref></sup> is <italic>all fair</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2018">59</xref></sup> and there shall be no blemish in him. Instead He admonished him concerning his seed, that he is to teach them these laws and warn them throughout their generations. In the section on impurity immediately following, however, He does say: <italic>Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2019">60</xref></sup> because it is possible that even Aaron might happen to become impure by touching a corpse or a dead swarming thing.<sup><xref rid="fn2020">61</xref></sup> But when He comes to mention the impurity of leprosy or a flux, He again says, <italic>What man soever of the seed of Aaron</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2021">62</xref></sup> because this would not happen to the body [of Aaron], <italic>for he is the messenger of the Eternal of hosts</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2022">63</xref></sup> At the end of this section He states, <italic>So Moses spoke unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2023">64</xref></sup> [although Moses had been told, <italic>Speak unto Aaron, saying</italic>, etc.], because Moses wanted to warn Aaron&#x2019;s sons as well in order that they should receive the instruction directly from his mouth. He also said so <italic>to the children of Israel</italic>, which means that he warned the court of Israel on this matter.</p>
<p>Now in the Torath Kohanim I have found this text:<sup><xref rid="fn2024">65</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2025">66</xref></sup> Why is this said [since it has already been mentioned in the preceding verse]? But because it says <italic>the seed of Aaron</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2026">67</xref></sup> I would only know that this law [of blemishes] applies to Aaron&#x2019;s offspring. How do I know that it applies to Aaron himself? From the verse which states, <italic>For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2025">66</xref></sup> Similarly it has been taught there:<sup><xref rid="fn2027">68</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>The seed of Aaron</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2026">67</xref></sup> I would only know that this law [of blemishes] applies to Aaron&#x2019;s offspring. How do I know that it applies to Aaron himself? From the verse which states, <italic>For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish. &#x201D;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2025">66</xref></sup> Similarly it has been taught there:<sup><xref rid="fn2027">68</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>The seed of Aaron</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2026">67</xref></sup> I would only know that this law applies to Aaron&#x2019;s seed. How do I know that it applies to Aaron himself? From the verse <italic>and he is a leper, or hath an issue</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2021">62</xref></sup> Now [that which the Torath Kohanim states] &#x201C;Aaron himself,&#x201D; means [any] High Priest <italic>that shall be in his stead among his sons</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2028">69</xref></sup> [but it does not mean Aaron personally, since, as explained above, Scripture does not mention Aaron&#x2019;s name with reference to having a blemish or suffering from leprosy or an issue. It did, however, have to include the High Priest in the law of blemishes], because having permitted the High Priest [to officiate] whilst he is an <italic>onen</italic>, one might perhaps think that it also permits him [to officiate] although he has a blemish or leprosy. For this reason it became necessary to include him in this law. Or it may be that [the Torath Kohanim] <italic>is</italic> alluding to the law about Aaron himself, for the Torah in its prohibitions does not rely on a miracle. However, it concealed it [the prohibition] in connection with Aaron, in his honor, thus hinting that this would [in fact] not happen to him.</p>
<p>18. &#x2018;O (OR) CHARUM O (OR) SARU&#x2019;A.&#x2019; &#x201C;[<italic>Charum</italic>] is anyone whose nose is sunk between his two eyes, so that he is able to paint both his eyes [for cosmetic purposes] with one stroke.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And in the Torath Kohanim<sup><xref rid="fn2029">70</xref></sup> and in the Gemara of Tractate Bechoroth<sup><xref rid="fn2030">71</xref></sup> we have been taught: &#x201C;<italic>Charum</italic> is one whose nose is sunk. [How do I know about] one whose nose is obstructed? or one whose nose is turned up? or whose nose overhangs his lips? From the expression <italic>o charum</italic>, [the word <italic>&#x2018;o&#x2019;</italic> (or) includes these blemishes]. Aba Yosei says: The word <italic>charum</italic> means only one who can paint both his eyes with one stroke. But the Rabbis said to him: &#x2018;You have overstated it. Even though he cannot paint both his eyes with one stroke&#x2019;&#x201D; [because his nose is not so deeply sunken, he may nonetheless come within the term <italic>charum</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2031">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>The term <italic>charum</italic> is of the expressions: <italic>None &#x2018;cheirem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>doomed</italic>) <italic>who shall be &#x2018;yachoram&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>doomed of man</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn2032">73</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;hacharamti&#x2019;</italic>(<italic>and I shall utterly destroy</italic>) <italic>their cities</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2033">74</xref></sup> the meaning thereof being destruction. Now [a man with a sunken nose] is called <italic>charum</italic> because the nose determines the beauty of the face, just as the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2034">75</xref></sup> &#x201C;Evidence [as to the identity of a corpse] may not be given unless [from proof afforded by recognition] of the face together with the nose,&#x201D; and if someone&#x2019;s nose is unlike that of the appearance of normal people, the shape [of his face] is deemed &#x201C;destroyed.&#x201D;</p>
<p><italic>&#x2018;O gibein o dak o t&#x2019;valul b&#x2019;eino.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2035">76</xref></sup> The expression &#x2018;<italic>o gibein&#x2019;</italic> is connected with the word <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;eino&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>in his eye</italic>), meaning that he is either a <italic>gibein</italic> in his eye, or has a <italic>dak</italic> (membrane) or a <italic>t&#x2019;valul</italic> (a speck) in his eye, <italic>gibein</italic> meaning that the hair of his eyebrows are so long that they lie over his eyes, of the expressions: <italic>&#x2018;gav&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the side of</italic>) <italic>the altar;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2036">77</xref></sup> <italic>upon &#x2018;gabi&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>my back</italic>) <italic>plowed the plowers</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2037">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Scripture mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn2038">79</xref></sup> first [in Verse 18 before us] blemishes of missing limbs: <italic>a blind man, or a lame</italic>, and afterwards [it</p>
<p>mentioned blemishes which are a result of] the smallness of the limbs, such as the <italic>charum</italic> [whose nose is sunk into his face, and consequently is shorter than the normal nose], or a result of the largeness of the limbs, such as the <italic>saru&#x2019;a</italic> [meaning &#x201C;anything too long,&#x201D; as where one eye is larger than the other, or one leg longer]. Then in the following verse [19] it cites blemishes because of the breaking of bones even though he has all his limbs with him, nonetheless, if the bone is broken, he is disqualified [from ministering the Service]. Then [in Verse 20] He disqualified [a priest from performing the Service] even on account of a hideous appearance, such as one whose eyebrows overhang his eyes, or who has kernel-like growths in his eyes [like a membrane or a speck], and then it mentioned blemishes on the flesh of the body [such as scabs or scurvy], because he [the priest] must be clean and smooth [in flesh]. And afterwards He added [<italic>o m&#x2019;roach ashech</italic>, which means] one who has wind [and as a result of which] his testicles are swollen, even though it is a sickness common amongst older people, and is not a blemish in the bone or flesh. Now our Rabbis have explained<sup><xref rid="fn2039">80</xref></sup> many other blemishes which are deduced from these, for those mentioned in the Torah are merely the primary [categories of those] blemishes [deduced by the Rabbis].</p>
<h1>22</h1>
<p>2. SPEAK UNTO AARON AND TO HIS SONS, THAT THEY SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM THE HOLY THINGS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND THAT THEY PROFANE NOT MY HOLY NAME, WHICH THEY HALLOW UNTO ME. &#x201C;Transpose the verse<sup><xref rid="fn2040">81</xref></sup> and interpret it thus: &#x2018;that they [the priests when in a state of impurity] separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they [the children of Israel] hallow unto Me, and that they [the priests] profane not My holy Name.&#x2019; <italic>Which they hallow unto Me</italic>, this comes to include things hallowed by the priests themselves.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>But if we explain <italic>which they hallow unto Me</italic> as referring to [the things] which the priests themselves hallow, then there is no need for this transposition&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn2041">82</xref></sup> Rather, [according to this final interpretation mentioned by Rashi, the whole verse can be explained in the order it is written without transposing the phrases, in the following way: ] Scripture is stating: &#x201C;<italic>that they</italic> [the priests] <italic>separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they</italic> [the priests] <italic>profane not</italic> by means of them [i.e., the holy things] <italic>My holy Name</italic> [through eating them in a state of impurity], and that <italic>which they</italic> [the priests themselves] <italic>hallow unto Me</italic>&#x201D; [they should also not profane], meaning that they [the priests] should not profane the holy things which Aaron and his sons themselves hallow unto Me [and thus there is no need for transposing the verse.]&#x0021; And in the Torath Kohanim it is interpreted as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn2042">83</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>That they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel</italic>. For <italic>the holy things of the children of Israel</italic> [the priests] are liable to punishment for [eating] <italic>pigul</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2043">84</xref></sup> <italic>nothar</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2044">85</xref></sup> or when in a state of impurity, but they are not liable for [eating] <italic>pigul, nothar</italic>, or when in a state of impurity if they are holy things of non-Jews.<sup><xref rid="fn2045">86</xref></sup> <italic>The holy things of the children of Israel</italic>. From this I would only know that [the priests when in a state of impurity are not to eat of] the holy things of the children of Israel. How do I know [that this prohibition applies also to] the holy things which they themselves have hallowed? From the expression, <italic>which they hallow unto Me</italic>, which includes all of them&#x201D; [even those of the priests themselves]. But there [in the Torath Kohanim] no mention is made at all of a transposition of the verse [as Rashi said]&#x0021; And by the way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], <italic>which they hallow unto Me, I am the Eternal</italic> means that the priests are not to profane the Name which is hallowed to Him,<sup><xref rid="fn2046">87</xref></sup> since His Name is upon the Sanctuary of the Eternal [and therefore they should not cause My Presence to depart therefrom when they profane the holy things].<sup><xref rid="fn2047">88</xref></sup> I have already alluded to this in the section of <italic>&#x2018;V&#x2019;yikchu Li Terumah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>And they take for Me an offering</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2048">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. &#x2018;N&#x2019;VEILAH&#x2019; (THAT WHICH DIETH OF ITSELF) &#x2018;U&#x2019;TREIFAH&#x2019; (OR IS TORN OF BEASTS) HE SHALL NOT EAT TO DEFILE HIMSELF THEREWITH. Scripture is stating that [the priest] should be careful not to eat <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic> or <italic>treifah</italic> so that he should not become defiled therewith, and then it will be necessary for him to be separated from the holy things,<sup><xref rid="fn2049">90</xref></sup> and he will not be able to eat of them until he bathes his flesh in water, <italic>and when the sun is down, he shall be clean</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2050">91</xref></sup> And the reason [why He mentioned here the prohibition against eating <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic> and <italic>treifah</italic>], is that since He had referred to every sort of impurity which can occur to a person, seeing that He mentioned leprosy and an issue,<sup><xref rid="fn2051">92</xref></sup> which includes male and female, and the impurity of the dead,<sup><xref rid="fn2052">93</xref></sup> of semen,<sup><xref rid="fn2051">92</xref></sup> and of a swarming thing,<sup><xref rid="fn2053">94</xref></sup> therefore He goes back [in the verse before us] to warn [the priests to separate themselves] from the holy things when they are impure because of <italic>n&#x2019;veiloth</italic>, and He warned them about this by way of an admonition against eating them. And the reason [why He singled out <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic> and <italic>treifah</italic> in warning the priests not to eat them, and He did not mention those creeping things which also render the eater impure], is because a man&#x2019;s soul finds it loathsome to eat creeping things, but it does not find <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic> and <italic>treifah</italic> loathsome. Therefore He mentioned here [the prohibition against eating food which conveys] impurity in the case of [that food] which it is common [to eat]. Now the word <italic>treifah</italic> mentioned here [which renders the eater impure, must perforce] mean an animal that was torn by a lion or bear which killed it in the field, for when it is still alive [and is then slaughtered ritually] it does not convey impurity [although it may not be eaten. The term <italic>treifah</italic> which the Torah mentions here as conveying impurity to one who eats it, is applicable, however, even to an animal that was not killed when torn by beasts], for from the moment when it is torn by the lion [or any beast] it is called <italic>treifah</italic> (&#x201C;torn&#x201D;), whether it is alive or after its death.<sup><xref rid="fn2054">95</xref></sup> Thus He mentioned here all sources of impurity, for having stated that animals of the forbidden species [which are not mentioned here, although they do convey impurity to one who eats them], cannot be [made permissible by] ritual slaughtering,<sup><xref rid="fn2055">96</xref></sup> as I have explained in the section of <italic>&#x2018;Vay&#x2019;hi Bayom Ha&#x2019;shemini&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>And it came to pass on the eighth day</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2056">97</xref></sup> it is [automatically] included under the term of <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic> [which is mentioned here]. This is by way of the plain meaning of Scripture. The [Rabbinical] explanation<sup><xref rid="fn2057">98</xref></sup> likewise interprets [this verse as an admonition] about holy things with reference to impurity, namely that the verse speaks of the carrion of a bird of a permissible species<sup><xref rid="fn2058">99</xref></sup> [i.e., which died by itself, or has not been slaughtered properly], which has no defiling effect by means of contact or carrying, but [conveys] impurity only when in the [eater&#x2019;s] gullet, and thus it forbids him to eat [subsequently] of the holy things. And we must then explain [that when Scripture states here] <italic>&#x2018;u&#x2019;treifah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>or is torn of beasts</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2059">100</xref></sup> [it is in order to define the term <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic>, and to explain that this law of impurity of <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic> refers only] to those <italic>kinds</italic> [of birds] that can have a <italic>treifah</italic> [i.e., to those species which may usually be eaten if slaughtered properly, but which are nonetheless <italic>treifah</italic> if found to be suffering from certain organic diseases, and consequently forbidden to be eaten], thus excluding the carrion of a bird of one of the <italic>forbidden</italic> species, for in its class no <italic>treifah</italic> is ever possible [for such a bird, even if ritually slaughtered, is still <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic>, since the law of <italic>treifah</italic> only applies to such birds which, if they were healthy, would be permitted as food by means of ritual slaughter, which does not apply to these forbidden species], as is stated in the language of Rashi [here]. And as far as the impurity of other <italic>n&#x2019;veiloth</italic> is concerned, [so that the priest must be careful not to be defiled by them as this will make it necessary for him to be separated from the holy things, although they are not expressly mentioned in Scripture], they have been included in the Torath Kohanim on the basis of the following interpretation:<sup><xref rid="fn2060">101</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Or whosoever toucheth &#x2018;b&#x2019;chol&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>any</italic>) <italic>swarming thing</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2061">102</xref></sup> I would only know the swarming thing. How do I know to include <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic>? From the expression <italic>b&#x2019;chol</italic> (any).&#x201D;</p>
<p>14. AND IF A MAN EAT OF THE HOLY THING<sup><xref rid="fn2062">103</xref></sup> THROUGH ERROR, THEN HE SHALL ADD ITS FIFTH PART UNTO IT, AND SHALL GIVE UNTO THE PRIEST THE HOLY THING. &#x201C;He must give him a thing which is capable of becoming holy [like the original holy food of the priest that he ate, thus teaching] that he is not to pay him money, but fruits of a non-holy status, which then become <italic>terumah</italic> (a heave-offering).&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Thus the explanation of the verse is as follows: &#x201C;A man that eats the holy thing [i.e., the heave-offering which belongs to the priest], must add the fifth of that holy thing to it, <italic>and give to the priest</italic> this <italic>holy thing</italic> which is its original value and the added fifth.&#x201D; And since Scripture called it [the restitution] <italic>kodesh</italic> (holy thing), we deduce that it becomes as the original heave-offering [which he ate in error, and that it must therefore be] something which is capable of so becoming [namely fruits, but not money]. This is the correct explanation according to both the plain meaning of Scripture and the [Rabbinical] interpretation thereof. So also did Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra comment: &#x201C;<italic>And he shall give unto the priests &#x2018;eth&#x2019; the holy thing</italic>, means &#x2018;with&#x2019; the holy thing [i.e., he is to give the priest its original value with the added fifth, all in fruits]. Or it may that the word <italic>v&#x2019;nathan</italic> (and he shall give) draws along with it a similar word, and the sense of the verse is thus: &#x2018;then he shall add its fifth part to it and shall give unto the priest, and he shall give unto the priest the holy thing.&#x2019; But in my opinion [so continues Ibn Ezra], there is no need [for both interpretations] because of the word <italic>alav</italic> (to it).&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2063">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND THEY SHALL NOT PROFANE THE HOLY THINGS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &#x2014; &#x201C;by giving them to non-priests to be eaten.&#x201D; 16. AND SO CAUSE &#x2018;OTHAM&#x2019; (THEM) TO BEAR THE INIQUITY THAT BRINGETH GUILT. &#x201C;[The word <italic>otham</italic> here means] &#x2018;themselves,&#x2019; meaning that they [the priests) cause themselves to bear iniquity when they [the non-priests] eat the holy things which have been set aside as the heave-offering, and have become sanctified as such, and forbidden to them [the non-priests]. And Onkelos who rendered the verse: &#x2018;when they [the priests] eat them in impurity&#x2019; has translated it so unnecessarily.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2064">105</xref></sup> Thus far is the language of Rashi, of blessed memory.</p>
<p>But I did not understand Rashi&#x2019;s opinion. For it would appear from his words that this negative commandment constitutes a prohibition to the priests, that they are not to give the heave-offering to non-priests to eat of it. And if so, it would be fitting to explain [the word <italic>&#x2018;otham&#x2019;</italic> in the phrase] <italic>and so cause &#x2018;otham&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>them</italic>), as a pronoun for &#x201C;Israel,&#x201D; meaning that the priests will thereby burden the Israelites with <italic>the iniquity that beareth guilt</italic>, when they [the Israelites] eat the holy things&#x0021; Why then did Rabbi Yishmael find it necessary to interpret the word <italic>otham</italic> [as a reflexive form], meaning &#x201C;themselves&#x201D; [as Rashi mentioned]? Besides, this negative commandment is not mentioned [specifically] in the Talmud, but instead the priest is forbidden to do so as is the case with all other prohibitions [where we are forbidden to help or cause another person to commit a transgression].<sup><xref rid="fn2065">106</xref></sup> Rather, the explanation of the phrase <italic>the children of Israel</italic> [in Verse 15] is that it refers back to the beginning [part of that verse, thus making it as follows]: &#x201C;<italic>and</italic> the children of Israel <italic>shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel which they set apart unto the Eternal</italic>,&#x201D; the verse thus constituting a second admonition<sup><xref rid="fn2066">107</xref></sup> to the non-priest that he is not to eat of the holy things, [and the reason why it is repeated is] because He wanted to mention the punishment for the transgression thereof, stating <italic>and they will cause themselves to bear the iniquity</italic> etc. <italic>when they</italic> [the non-priests] <italic>will eat their holy things</italic>.</p>
<p>Now our Rabbis explained [that the reason for] the repetition of this admonition was to forbid the eating of <italic>tevel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2067">108</xref></sup> Thus they have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2068">109</xref></sup> &#x201C;Whence do we know that one who eats <italic>tevel</italic> is liable to death [by the hand of Heaven]? From the verse, <italic>And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel which &#x2018;yarimu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>they shall set apart</italic>) <italic>unto the Eternal</italic>. Now the verse refers to that which is <italic>yet</italic> to be offered [namely, the verse refers to the holy things &#x2014; the heave-offering and the tithes &#x2014; which are not yet set apart from the produce, so that it is all <italic>tevel</italic>];<sup><xref rid="fn2067">108</xref></sup> and then an identity of law is learned from the use of &#x2018;profanation&#x2019; here and in the case of the heave-offering:<sup><xref rid="fn2069">110</xref></sup> [just as there the penalty is death by the hand of Heaven, so here too].&#x201D;</p>
<p>However, in the Torath Kohanim I have found this text:<sup><xref rid="fn2070">111</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And they shall not profane</italic>. This includes one who anoints himself with or drinks [oil of heave-offering].<sup><xref rid="fn2071">112</xref></sup> <italic>The holy things of the children of Israel</italic>. For the things [declared] holy by the children of Israel, [a non-priest who eats of them by mistake] is liable to pay the priest their value and the added fifth [in fruits], but for the things [declared] holy by non-Jews, he [a non-priest] is not liable to repay [the priest] their value and the added fifth.<sup><xref rid="fn2072">113</xref></sup> I might think that he is liable [to pay a fifth] for the heave-offering that is in the <italic>tevel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2067">108</xref></sup> [as will be explained further on]; Scripture therefore states, <italic>that which &#x2018;yarimu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>they will set apart</italic>) <italic>unto the Eternal</italic>. For that which has been set apart they are liable to pay [an added fifth], but they are not liable to pay [an added fifth] for the heave-offering in the <italic>tevel</italic> [which has not yet been set apart]. <italic>And so they will cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt</italic>. This teaches us that for eating <italic>tevel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2067">108</xref></sup> one is also punishable by death [by the hand of Heaven].&#x201D; Now this [Beraitha of the Torath Kohanim] is not in accord with the way of the Gemara [mentioned above].<sup><xref rid="fn2073">114</xref></sup> But I say that the inclusion of anointing and drinking [in the prohibition of our verse] is only a Scriptural support for a Rabbinic ordinance, since drinking is included in the term eating [and just as a non-priest is Scripturally forbidden to eat the heave-offering, so too he is Scripturally forbidden to drink it, without the necessity for a special inclusionary phrase], whilst anointing oneself with it is [only] prohibited by Rabbinic ordinance. It is so clearly explained in the Yerushalmi.<sup><xref rid="fn2074">115</xref></sup> And since He stated with reference to <italic>tevel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2067">108</xref></sup> <italic>And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel</italic>, because they are going to set aside a part thereof for the Eternal [as the future tense in the word <italic>yarimu</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;they <italic>will</italic> set apart&#x201D; &#x2014; indicates], the Rabbis deduced from this that [only] the portion which is set apart [as the heave-offering] is called &#x201C;holy&#x201D;, and not the <italic>tevel</italic>. And if so, [eating <italic>tevel</italic>] is <italic>not</italic> included in the terms of the law, <italic>And if a man eat of &#x2018;the holy&#x2019; thing through error, then he shall add its fifth to it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2075">116</xref></sup> so that he be liable to pay the additional fifth.<sup><xref rid="fn2076">117</xref></sup> It is for this reason that He teaches again, <italic>and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt</italic>, thereby teaching that eating <italic>tevel</italic> is also punishable by death [by the hand of Heaven], for it is the heave-offering in the <italic>tevel</italic> that is mentioned here. In brief, this verse speak of <italic>tevel</italic> and warns with reference to that which is yet to be offered in the future, according to the interpretation of our Rabbis.</p>
<p>18. FOR ALL &#x2018;NIDREIHEM&#x2019; (THEIR VOW-OFFERINGS) AND FOR ALL &#x2018;NIDVOTHAM&#x2019; (THEIR FREEWILL-OFFERINGS). &#x201C;<italic>Nidreihem</italic> (their vow-offerings). This is when one says, &#x2018;I pledge myself [to bring an offering].&#x2019; <italic>Nidvotham</italic> (their freewill-offerings). This is when one says, &#x2018;This shall be [an offering].&#x2019; &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2077">118</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.<sup><xref rid="fn2078">119</xref></sup> It appears to me that because Scripture states <italic>&#x2018;l&#x2019;phalei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>to clearly utter</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2079">120</xref></sup> <italic>in fulfillment of a vow or for a freewill-offering</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2080">121</xref></sup> and similarly it always uses this [identical] expression in the section dealing with the drink-offerings,<sup><xref rid="fn2081">122</xref></sup> and likewise it is used in the verse, <italic>when a man &#x2018;yaphli&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>shall clearly utter</italic>) <italic>a vow of persons</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2082">123</xref></sup> and so also in the section dealing with the Nazirite<sup><xref rid="fn2083">124</xref></sup> &#x2014; [therefore it appears] that &#x201C;the vow&#x201D; is something which comes in connection with that which is beyond our power, the person in distress vowing unto G-d that &#x201C;if You will deal &#x2018;wondrously&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2084">125</xref></sup> with me to save me from this trouble, then I will bring a burnt-offering or peace-offering,&#x201D; similar to that which is stated: <italic>And Jacob vowed a vow, saying: &#x2018;If G-d will be with me;&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2085">126</xref></sup> <italic>And Israel vowed a vow unto the Eternal, and said: &#x2018;If Thou wilt deliver this people into my hand;&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2086">127</xref></sup> <italic>and they vowed vows</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2087">128</xref></sup> and so also all similar verses.</p>
<p>And our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2088">129</xref></sup> &#x201C;Which is a vow-offering? When he says, &#x2018;I pledge myself to bring a burnt-offering.&#x2019; [Which is] a freewill-offering? When he says, &#x2018;This [animal] shall be a burnt-offering.&#x2019; And what is the difference between a vow-offering and a freewill-offering? In the case of a vow-offering, one is responsible for it [and must replace it] if it dies or is stolen, [since he took upon himself a general obligation to offer an animal], but in the case of a freewill-offering, he is not responsible for it if it dies or is stolen&#x201D; [since he did not assume a general pledge upon himself, but merely said that this particular animal should be an offering]. Now the reason for this difference between them [a vow and a freewill-offering],<sup><xref rid="fn2088">129</xref></sup> is because the custom of those vowing in the time of their distress is to say, &#x201C;<italic>If G-d will be with me</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2085">126</xref></sup> [and guard me] in this [trouble], then I pledge myself to offer a burnt-offering or a [peace-] offering,&#x201D; and this is not usually called a freewill-offering, [since he has not yet set aside any particular animal for it]. But [a vow which is followed] by setting aside immediately [an animal] and giving it, is called &#x201C;a freewill-offering,&#x201D; because from the moment of giving, <italic>his spirit made</italic> him <italic>willing</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2089">130</xref></sup> Thus Scripture is stating here that whether he brings a burnt-offering or a peace-offering which he vowed at the time of his distress, or whether he brings them because his spirit made him willing &#x2014; in either case it must be perfect [without blemish], for perhaps we might have thought that [it is more important that] the vow-offering should be perfect than the freewill-offering. This is the meaning of the verse.</p>
<p>23. ANY OF THE HERD OR FLOCK THAT HATH A LIMB TOO LARGE OR TOO SMALL, THAT MAYEST THOU MAKE FOR &#x2018;NEDAVAH&#x2019; (A FREEWILL-OFFERING) &#x2014; &#x201C;for keeping the Temple in repair.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2090">131</xref></sup> &#x2018;UL&#x2019;NEDER&#x2019; (BUT FOR A VOW-OFFERING) IT SHALL NOT BE ACCEPTED &#x2014; &#x201C;for the altar. What hallowed thing is it that effects propitiation? I must say that it is something dedicated to the altar.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But according to this explanation, we must interpret the verse, <italic>that mayest thou make for &#x2018;nedavah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a freewill-offering</italic>), <italic>&#x2018;ul&#x2019;neder&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>but for a vow-offering</italic>) <italic>it shall not be accepted</italic> as stating: that [a blemished animal] may be given as a freewill gift or as a vow [to be sold so that its money is used] for the Temple repair, but not for acceptance [to be offered up itself] on the altar; for there is no difference between a <italic>neder</italic> (vow-offering) and <italic>nedevah</italic> (freewill-offering) in this respect at all, both being permissible for the Temple repair<sup><xref rid="fn2091">132</xref></sup> and prohibited for the altar [on account of the blemish in them], and Scripture has already mentioned this in the case of the burnt-offering, <italic>whether it be any of their vow-offerings, or any of their freewill-offerings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2092">133</xref></sup> and in the case of the peace-offering, <italic>in fulfillment of a vow-offering clearly uttered, or for a freewill-offering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2080">121</xref></sup> And such is the interpretation of our Rabbis in the Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn2093">134</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that we can improve the explanation as to the language of Scripture [i.e., why it uses here the term <italic>nedavah</italic> for a freewill gift for Temple repair]. For since most freewill gifts are given for Temple repair, as it is said with reference to the Tabernacle, <italic>all that were &#x2018;n&#x2019;div leiv&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>willing-hearted</italic>) &#x2026;<sup><xref rid="fn2094">135</xref></sup> <italic>brought the Eternal&#x2019;s offering</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2095">136</xref></sup> and similarly with reference to the Sanctuary it is said, <italic>As for me, in the uprightness of my heart &#x2018;hithnadavti&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>I have willingly offered</italic>) <italic>all these things</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2096">137</xref></sup> and so also in connection with the Second Temple it is said, <italic>beside &#x2018;ha&#x2019;nedavah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the freewill-offering</italic>) <italic>for the House of G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2097">138</xref></sup> and it is likewise written about the Temple repair, <italic>all the money that cometh into any man&#x2019;s heart to bring into the House of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2098">139</xref></sup> therefore it is [called] the freewill gift [without qualification, and Scripture here uses the term <italic>nedavah</italic> as referring not to a type of offering, but to the freewill gift for Temple repair]. And the reason for [this expression] is that there is nothing in connection with gifts for Temple repair which is obligatory, for [they are all brought only as a consequence of] willingness of the soul, and the custom of those who give a donation for Temple repair is that they bring it with [the language used in offering a] freewill-offering, &#x201C; &#x2018;This is&#x2019; for the building.&#x201D; Therefore wherever Scripture mentions <italic>nedavah</italic> without any qualification, it is for Temple repair, unless [the donor] expressly says that it is <italic>for a burnt-offering</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2092">133</xref></sup> or <italic>an offering of peace-offerings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2080">121</xref></sup> as mentioned above. But the term <italic>neder</italic> (vow) without any qualification is said with reference to the holy things of the altar: <italic>I will offer to Thee the offering of thanksgiving &#x2026; I will pay &#x2018;nedarai&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>my vows</italic>) <italic>unto the Eternal, yea in the presence of all His people, in the courts of the Eternal&#x2019;s House;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2099">140</xref></sup> <italic>I will come into Thy House with burnt-offerings, I will perform unto Thee &#x2018;nedarai&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>my vows</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn2100">141</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;Nedarecha&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>Thy vows</italic>) <italic>are upon me, O G-d; I will render thanks-offerings unto Thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2101">142</xref></sup> And those who give for the altar bring [their animals] with [the language used in offering a vow-offering], saying, &#x201C;If G-d will prosper me, I will come before Him with a burnt-offering.&#x201D; It is for this reason that Scripture says here, <italic>Any of the herd or flock that hath a limb too large or too small, that mayest thou make &#x2018;nedavah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a freewill gift</italic>) [for Temple repair], for whatever his heart offers freewillingly, <italic>but for a &#x2018;neder&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a vow</italic>) for G-d [i.e., for His altar] <italic>it shall not be accepted</italic>, just as He said, <italic>that ye shall not bring, for it shall not be acceptable for you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2102">143</xref></sup> For Scripture did not say here, &#x201C;<italic>nedavah &#x2018;takriv&#x2019; otho</italic> (thou mayest &#x2018;offer&#x2019; it as a freewill-offering),&#x201D; which would have been similar to the expression [of <italic>thakrivu</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;they shall offer&#x201D; on the altar] used in this whole section,<sup><xref rid="fn2103">144</xref></sup> but instead it says <italic>&#x2018;ta&#x2019;aseh otho&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thou mayest &#x2018;make&#x2019; it</italic>) &#x2014; meaning to say, you may make of it <italic>whatever thy hand attaineth to do by thy strength</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2104">145</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>but for a vow-offering it shall not be accepted</italic>. Now [the reason] the Sages were forced to say this [interpretation, i.e., that <italic>nedavah ta&#x2019;aseh otho</italic> here means that you may give the blemished animal as a gift to the Temple treasury, but may not bring it as an offering] is because it is in no way whatsoever possible to say that [an animal suffering from] any blemishes [mentioned in the <italic>preceding</italic> verses], namely, scabbed and scurvy,<sup><xref rid="fn2105">146</xref></sup> or even one whose testicles are bruised or crushed,<sup><xref rid="fn2106">147</xref></sup> be forbidden for any kind of offering, whether as a vow-offering or a freewill-offering, and then an animal which has any limb too long or too short [as mentioned in the verse before us] be forbidden for use only for some offerings, [i.e., vow-offerings] and permissible for others [i.e., freewill-offerings]&#x0021; Such a distinction [between the kinds of offering] is not found in the Torah with reference to blemishes or impurity in those who perform the rites of the offerings [i.e., the priests]&#x0021;</p>
<p>It is possible that He said that <italic>any of the herd or flock that hath a limb too large or too small</italic>, one may make into a freewill-offering [for the Temple repairs] by saying, &#x201C;This shall be [<italic>nedavah</italic> &#x2014; a gift]; &#x201D; but if he had vowed [for the Temple repairs by saying] &#x201C;I pledge myself [to donate] of the herd or flock,&#x201D; then if he brings a blemished animal it will not be acceptable for him, and he is not freed of his vow. We may thus say in accordance with the way [of interpretation] of our Rabbis that both [<italic>nedavah</italic> and <italic>neder</italic> mentioned in the verse before us] refer to gifts for the Temple repairs, since the expression <italic>&#x2018;ta&#x2019;aseh otho&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thou mayest &#x2018;make&#x2019; it</italic>) is unlike <italic>takriv otho</italic> [&#x201C;thou mayest &#x2018;offer&#x2019; it&#x201D; on the altar]. This is without doubt the truth.</p>
<p>Now Scripture mentioned the permissibility of making a gift for the Temple repairs in the case of an animal that has a limb too long or too short, which are congenital blemishes in the formation of the animal, and it follows all the more so that an animal having small blemishes by [later] occurrence, such as <italic>avereth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2105">146</xref></sup> which is blindness [caused] by the dimming of the eye, or a broken animal,<sup><xref rid="fn2105">146</xref></sup> and needless to say [an animal that is] scabbed or [suffering from] scurvy,<sup><xref rid="fn2105">146</xref></sup> [may be given as gifts for the Temple repairs]. It is possible that the verse [before us] is connected [with the preceding verse, thus]: &#x201C;<italic>Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wart, or scabbed, or scurvy</italic> &#x2026; and all <italic>herd or flock that hath any thing too long or too short, thou mayest make a freewill gift</italic> of any of these, <italic>but for a vow-offering</italic> [for the altar] <italic>none</italic> of these <italic>will be acceptable</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2106">147</xref></sup> for him, meaning that even if they had been taken up to the altar, they must be brought down.<sup><xref rid="fn2107">148</xref></sup> And in the Torath Kohanim [it is written]:<sup><xref rid="fn2108">149</xref></sup> &#x201C;Whence do we know to include all disqualifications in the herd or flock?<sup><xref rid="fn2109">150</xref></sup> From the verse, <italic>any of the herd or flock</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2110">151</xref></sup> <italic>that hath a limb too large or too small</italic>, which includes all disqualifications of the herd or flock.&#x201D; Our Rabbis have further included [a principle] within the expression <italic>that mayest thou make for a freewill gift</italic>, meaning that he may make [a blemished animal] as a gift for whatever [purpose in the Temple that] he pleases, but not unblemished animals, so that one who dedicates unblemished animals [which are fit for the altar] for Temple repairs, transgresses a positive commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn2111">152</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. AND WHETHER IT BE OF THE HERD OR FLOCK, &#x2018;OTHO V&#x2019;ETH B&#x2019;NO&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2112">153</xref></sup> (IT AND ITS YOUNG) YE SHALL NOT SLAUGHTER IN ONE DAY. &#x201C;[The law] applies only in the case of the female parent, it being forbidden to slaughter the dam and its male young, or the dam and its female young, but it does not apply to the male parent, and it is therefore permissible to slaughter the male parent and his young.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>The Rabbi [Rashi] thus decided that the conclusive decision of the law is in accordance with the opinion of the Sage<sup><xref rid="fn2113">154</xref></sup> who says that we do not take into consideration the male parentage [of animals]. And such also is the opinion of Onkelos [who translated: &#x201C;and whether it be the dam or the ewe, her and her young ye shall not slaughter in one day&#x201D;]. This is the correct decision [reached] in the Gemara [of Tractate Chullin]<sup><xref rid="fn2114">155</xref></sup> concerning the law of &#x201C;It and its young.&#x201D; But the way of Scripture when mentioning specifically the female [of the herd], is to call it <italic>parah</italic> (cow),<sup><xref rid="fn2115">156</xref></sup> and if so it would have been proper that Scripture say, &#x201C;and whether it be <italic>parah</italic> (cow) or ewe, her and her young.&#x201D; But since He had mentioned [at the beginning of this section], <italic>When any of the herd, or a sheep or a goat is brought forth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2116">157</xref></sup> and He mentioned the dam and its young by saying, <italic>then it shall be seven days under its dam</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2116">157</xref></sup> He therefore states [in the verse before us] that concerning these kinds of animals mentioned, namely, the herd and the flock, there is yet another commandment that <italic>it and its young</italic> mentioned above, must not be slaughtered <italic>in one day</italic> [and thus it is self-evident that the law applies only to the female parent].</p>
<p>31. AND YE SHALL KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS. The meaning of this is that here He admonished Israel to keep the commandments, that they should be careful with the offerings [that they should not have] blemishes, or be wanting in time, such as before completion of the seven days [after birth of the animal], and [that they may not be slaughtered] on the day that the dam had been slaughtered [or conversely], and that they bring the peace-offerings and the thanks-offering [properly as ordained], and that they slaughter them with the intention that they be accepted for them;<sup><xref rid="fn2117">158</xref></sup> thus He included therein all commandments together. Now He has already mentioned above with reference to the statutes and ordinances, <italic>And ye shall observe all My statutes, and all Mine ordinances</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2118">159</xref></sup> He states [here], <italic>And ye shall not profane My holy Name</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2119">160</xref></sup> which means to say that there should not be among you <italic>one who dealeth craftily</italic>, [<italic>whereas he hath in his flock a male, and voweth</italic>,] <italic>and sacrificeth unto the Eternal a blemished thing</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2120">161</xref></sup> just as He said with reference to the sons of Aaron, <italic>and they profane not My holy Name</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2121">162</xref></sup> warning them in connection with the offerings against impurity or blemishes.</p>
<p>32. AND I WILL BE HALLOWED AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The meaning thereof according to the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn2122">163</xref></sup> is that it constitutes a positive commandment, that we sanctify His Name by observing the commandments, and that [under certain circumstances] we submit to death rather than transgress them.<sup><xref rid="fn2123">164</xref></sup> This is the explanation of the following verse, <italic>That brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2124">165</xref></sup> which is a reason including all the commandments, meaning that it is fitting for them to sanctify His Name because we are His servants whom He has redeemed from Egypt.</p>

The priests have no greater duties with regard to the festivals than the Israelites, therefore He did not admonish Aaron and his sons in this section, but <italic>the children of Israel</italic>, a term which includes all of them together, since He did not explain the Additional Offerings [for the festivals] in this section.<sup><xref rid="fn2125">166</xref></sup> However, He mentioned the festivals here in Torath Kohanim (i.e. Book of Leviticus) because they are days of offerings, and He alludes to them, just as He said, <italic>And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2126">167</xref></sup> and at the end of this section He states, <italic>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a peace-offering, and drink-offerings</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2127">168</xref></sup> He did not, however, prolong the subject by explaining the Additional Offerings, since He did not want them to be binding upon the children of Israel when in the desert, and after He had counted [at the end of the desert period] those who were to come into the Land, as narrated in the Book of Numbers,<sup><xref rid="fn2128">169</xref></sup> and He commanded, <italic>Unto these the Land shall be divided</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2129">170</xref></sup> He then explained all the Additional Offerings in the section of <italic>Pinchas</italic>, which they were to offer in the Land immediately and throughout the generations. Therefore He said [here in this Book of Leviticus] with reference to [the Service on] the Day of Atonement, <italic>And he</italic> [i.e., Aaron] <italic>did as the Eternal commanded Moses</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2130">171</xref></sup> meaning that he did so in the desert [but the Additional Offerings for the other festivals were not binding in the desert].</p>
<p>Now He mentioned in this section the &#x201C;he-lamb of the sheaf&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2131">172</xref></sup> and the two lambs of the Festival of Shevuoth,<sup><xref rid="fn2132">173</xref></sup> because it is well-known that they were binding only in the Land, since they are brought on account of <italic>the bread</italic> [<italic>of the first-fruits</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn2133">174</xref></sup> concerning which He said, <italic>When ye are come into the Land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2134">175</xref></sup> but the observance of the days themselves [as festivals] was binding immediately.</p>
<p>He mentioned the Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn2135">176</xref></sup> among <italic>the appointed seasons which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2136">177</xref></sup> [although the Sabbath is not proclaimed by the children of Israel, since its sanctity has been affirmed by G-d and is fixed throughout the generations], because it is also &#x201C;an appointed day&#x201D; [invariably fixed by G-d as the holy day] and we may thus refer to it as &#x201C;a holy convocation.&#x201D; Afterwards, He separated the rest of the festivals from the Sabbath, saying of them <italic>which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2137">178</xref></sup> meaning on whatever day of the week they happen to fall, but the Sabbath is fixed and occurs [always] on the same day, hence it is not necessary that we proclaim it in its season.<sup><xref rid="fn2138">179</xref></sup> And in the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup><xref rid="fn2139">180</xref></sup> <italic>which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season</italic> alludes to the intercalations [of an extra month in a leap year] so that you proclaim them as festivals.<sup><xref rid="fn2140">181</xref></sup></p>
<p>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the meaning of the verse <italic>The appointed seasons of the Eternal, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are My appointed seasons</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2136">177</xref></sup> is that it refers [only] to the festivals mentioned further on in the sections: <italic>In the first month</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2141">182</xref></sup> [but it does not refer to the Sabbath]. It is for this reason that He states there once again, <italic>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2137">178</xref></sup> because He had interrupted with the subject of the Sabbath. Thus He states, <italic>The appointed seasons of the Eternal, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are My appointed seasons</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2136">177</xref></sup> meaning that no manner of <italic>servile</italic> work [be done on them], but the Sabbath you are to keep, making it a <italic>Sabbath of solemn rest</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2135">176</xref></sup> from <italic>all</italic> manner of work<sup><xref rid="fn2142">183</xref></sup> whatsoever, for He admonishes concerning the Sabbath many times. He further alludes here [to the law that even] when the Sabbath falls on one of [the days of] the festivals, we must not suspend [the law of the Sabbath] so that the preparation of food be permitted on it [as it is on a festival day when it falls on a weekday, but instead it is prohibited]. A similar case [where the phrase <italic>these are</italic> refers to the continuation of a subject which had previously been mentioned, because in the middle Scripture interrupts with another subject], is the verse, <italic>These are the words which the Eternal hath commanded, that ye should do them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2143">184</xref></sup> which refers to the Tabernacle and its vessels which he [Moses] will mention in the second section, and [in the next verses] he interrupts with the Sabbath: <italic>Six days shall work be done, and on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day</italic> etc.;<sup><xref rid="fn2144">185</xref></sup> and then he again says, <italic>This is the thing which the Eternal commanded &#x2026; Take ye from among you an offering</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2145">186</xref></sup> this being the [same] command that Scripture had mentioned at the beginning, but because it was interrupted with another subject, Scripture had to start from the beginning again.</p>
<p>Proof for this interpretation is that He does not mention [here] in the case of the Sabbath, <italic>and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</italic> as He mentions at each and every festival,<sup><xref rid="fn2126">167</xref></sup> and at the end of the section He states, <italic>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal &#x2026; beside the Sabbaths of the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2146">187</xref></sup> [This shows] that the Sabbaths are not included within the terms of <italic>the appointed seasons of the Eternal</italic>. A further proof is that in the second section [i.e., in Verse 4 where He reverts to the festivals after having mentioned the Sabbath], He does not say, <italic>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses, saying</italic>, as He says in the case of each and every festival;<sup><xref rid="fn2147">188</xref></sup> for the first communication [to Moses] was indeed concerning the commandments of the festivals, but He mentioned the Sabbath in order to exclude from it the law of the festivals [i.e., that when the Sabbath coincides with a festival, the preparation of food which is permitted on a festival day, is forbidden since it is also a Sabbath, as explained above], but not in order to explain its commandments and laws [and therefore there was no need to repeat the verse, <italic>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses, saying</italic>]. This is the reason why He does not state [here] about the Sabbath <italic>And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</italic>, as He states concerning the festivals,<sup><xref rid="fn2148">189</xref></sup> and He mentions it at the end together with the vow-offerings and the freewill-offerings<sup><xref rid="fn2149">190</xref></sup> which are not mentioned here, as I have explained [above]. And this is the intention of the interpretation of the Sages,<sup><xref rid="fn2150">191</xref></sup> who said: &#x201C;What has the matter of the Sabbath to do with the festivals? etc.,&#x201D; since the Sabbath is not included at all in the terms of <italic>the appointed seasons of the Eternal</italic>, but Scripture only put them in juxtaposition [for the reason mentioned above].</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>&#x2018;mikra&#x2019;ei kodesh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>holy convocations</italic>), is that all people should come together on that day and be assembled to sanctify it, for it is a commandment upon Israel to be gathered together in G-d&#x2019;s House on the festival day to hallow it publicly with prayer and praise to G-d, and with clean garments, and to make it a day of feasting, as it is said in the tradition,<sup><xref rid="fn2151">192</xref></sup> <italic>Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared, for this day is holy unto our Lord; neither be ye grieved, for the joy of the Eternal is your strength</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2152">193</xref></sup> Thus the expression <italic>mikra kodesh</italic> (<italic>a holy convocation</italic>) is similar to: <italic>&#x2018;kru&#x2019;ei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>those called</italic>) <italic>of the congregation;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2153">194</xref></sup> <italic>afterwards they eat &#x2018;ha&#x2019;kru&#x2019;im&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>they that are called</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2154">195</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over &#x2018;mikra&#x2019;eha&#x2019;</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2155">196</xref></sup> meaning the places where they are called to, and where those called of the congregation assemble. Onkelos, however, [in rendering the Hebrew <italic>mikra&#x2019;ei kodesh</italic> as <italic>m&#x2019;arei kadish &#x2014; &#x201C;</italic>holy events&#x201D;], understood [the word <italic>mikra&#x2019;ei</italic>] as similar to the expression <italic>that which &#x2018;yikra&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>shall befall</italic>) <italic>you in the end of days</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2156">197</xref></sup> an expression of &#x201C;event,&#x201D; meaning that whenever the festivals occur, you should make them holy. And our Rabbis of blessed memory have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2157">198</xref></sup> &#x201C;Proclaim them with [special] food and drink and clean garments;&#x201D; that is to say, the nature of these [festival] days should not be to you like that of other days, but instead you should make them occasions of holiness, changing them by food and dress from the common to the holy. This is also the opinion of Onkelos [who translated <italic>mikra&#x2019;ei kodesh</italic> as &#x201C;holy events&#x201D;].</p>
<p>7. YE SHALL DO NO MANNER OF &#x2018;M&#x2019;LECHETH AVODAH&#x2019; (SERVILE WORK). &#x201C;[Not] even such work as is considered by you important and necessary work, because the neglect of it would involve a monetary loss, as for example a matter that will not permit delay. So I understood from the Torath Kohanim which teaches as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn2158">199</xref></sup> &#x2018;I might think that on intermediate days of the festival<sup><xref rid="fn2159">200</xref></sup> it is also forbidden to do <italic>m&#x2019;lecheth avodah</italic> (servile work) etc&#x2019; &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2160">201</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>But this is not correct at all. For what reason is there that Scripture should say, &#x201C;Do not do [on the festival days even] such work that will not permit delay,&#x201D; and [the prohibition for] all other labors be deduced by a <italic>kal vachomer</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2161">202</xref></sup> and if so it would have been proper to say it in the same way in the case of the Sabbath too&#x0021; [However, with reference to the Sabbath it says <italic>Ye shall do &#x2018;no manner&#x2019; of &#x2018;m&#x2019;lachah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>work</italic>), and it does not say <italic>m&#x2019;lecheth avodah</italic> (servile work) as in the case of the festivals&#x0021;] Moreover, if it be [as Rashi explained it], then there is an allusion in the Torah to the effect that on the intermediate days of the festival it is permissible to do work that will not permit delay, but the Rabbis have said,<sup><xref rid="fn2162">203</xref></sup> &#x201C;Scripture has handed over this matter [of determining which activities are forbidden and which are permitted on the intermediate days of the festival] only to the Sages,&#x201D; which means that there is no allusion in the Torah as to which work is permitted and which is forbidden&#x0021; Again, the term <italic>avodah</italic> (work) includes all kinds of labors and purposes, [as the following verses indicate]: <italic>&#x2018;oveid&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he that tilleth</italic>) <italic>his ground shall have plenty of bread;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2163">204</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;va&#x2019;avadcha&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he shall serve thee</italic>) <italic>six years;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2164">205</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;avad&#x2019;ta&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thou shalt serve</italic>) <italic>thine enemy</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2165">206</xref></sup> &#x2014; and nowhere does the term <italic>avodah</italic> mean only work that permits no delay, which, if not done today, can no longer be done on the following day [as Rashi had written]&#x0021;</p>
<p>Rather, the meaning of <italic>m&#x2019;lecheth avodah</italic> (servile work) is all work that is not necessary in the preparation of food, similar to that which it is said, <italic>Six days &#x2018;ta&#x2019;avod</italic> (<italic>shalt thou labor</italic>)<italic>, and do all thy work;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2166">207</xref></sup> <italic>and in all &#x2018;avodah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>manner of work</italic>) <italic>in the field;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2167">208</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;ne&#x2019;evadtem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and ye shall be tilled</italic>) <italic>and sown;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2168">209</xref></sup> <italic>but Cain was an &#x2018;oved&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>tiller</italic>) <italic>of the ground</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2169">210</xref></sup> But work which is done in preparation of food is work of direct benefit, and is not [called] <italic>m&#x2019;lecheth avodah</italic> (servile work). This [distinction] is clearly explained in the Torah. For with reference to the Festival of Unleavened Bread where He said at first, <italic>no manner of work shall be done in them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2170">211</xref></sup> it was necessary to explain [in the same verse], <italic>Save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you;</italic> therefore with respect to the other festivals He shortened [the command] and said [as in the verse before us], <italic>ye shall do no manner of servile work</italic>, thus prohibiting all work which is not done in preparation of food, and informing us that the preparation of food is permissible on the festival days. And in no place does Scripture say concerning any of the festival days, that &#x201C;no manner of work&#x201D; [shall be done on it] without explaining [immediately] that the preparation of food is permissible on it, because the form <italic>m&#x2019;lecheth avodah</italic> (servile work) establishes that principle.<sup><xref rid="fn2171">212</xref></sup> However, in the section of <italic>All the firstling males</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2172">213</xref></sup> [where all the festivals are mentioned], He states with reference to the Festival of Unleavened Bread, <italic>and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the Eternal thy G-d; thou shalt do no work therein</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2173">214</xref></sup> [and yet Scripture does <italic>not</italic> follow it up with a permission for preparing food]&#x0021; The reason for this is that He had already clearly permitted<sup><xref rid="fn2174">215</xref></sup> the preparation of food on it [Passover], and it was therefore no longer necessary [there in the section of <italic>All the firstling males</italic>] to say in connection with it: &#x201C;all manner of servile work.&#x201D; He mentioned there merely &#x201C;work&#x201D; (<italic>thou shalt do no &#x2018;work&#x2019; therein</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2173">214</xref></sup> and did not say <italic>kol m&#x2019;lachah</italic> (&#x201C;all work&#x201D; or &#x201C;any manner of work&#x201D;) as He said with reference to the Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn2135">176</xref></sup> and the Day of Atonement,<sup><xref rid="fn2175">216</xref></sup> because the intention is, &#x201C;Do not do that work about which I have admonished you [elsewhere, i.e., &#x2018;servile work&#x2019;].&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now Rabbi Chananel<sup><xref rid="fn2176">217</xref></sup> wrote: &#x201C;<italic>Do no manner of &#x2018;m&#x2019;lecheth avodah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>servile work</italic>). This teaches that He only permitted [on a festival day] the preparation of food, as it is written in connection with this matter in another place: <italic>And in the first day</italic> [of Passover] <italic>there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2170">211</xref></sup> And because He mentioned there <italic>any manner of work</italic> [which indicates a prohibition covering even preparation of food], it was essential that He should explain [in the same verse]: <italic>save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you</italic>. The meaning of <italic>m&#x2019;lecheth avodah</italic> is work for the purpose of material possessions, such as sowing, harvesting, digging and the like, but the preparation of food is not <italic>m&#x2019;lecheth avodah</italic>.&#x201D; This is Rabbeinu Chananel&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>And the Beraitha in the Torath Kohanim [which Rashi quoted at the beginning of the section] is taught as follows in the correct texts thereof:<sup><xref rid="fn2177">218</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Do no manner of &#x2018;m&#x2019;lecheth avodah.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2178">219</xref></sup> This is intended to elucidate [the law] about the intermediate days of the festival, that it is prohibited to do work on them. I might think that any manner of <italic>m&#x2019;lecheth avodah</italic> (servile work) is forbidden on them. Scripture therefore states <italic>it</italic> [i.e., the eighth day of Tabernacles, <italic>is a day of solemn assembly</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn2179">220</xref></sup> meaning: <italic>it</italic> is a day on which all manner of servile work is forbidden, but on the intermediate days [of the festival] such work is not forbidden. These are the words of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean. Rabbi Akiba says: What need is there for Scripture to say: <italic>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2180">221</xref></sup> If it refers to the festivals, they are each stated [separately]&#x0021; If so, why is it said, <italic>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations</italic>? This refers to the intermediate days of the festival, on which the doing of work is forbidden. I might think that all manner of servile work is forbidden to be done on them. Scripture therefore states, <italic>it</italic> etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2179">220</xref></sup> [as quoted above].</p>
<p>The explanation of this Beraitha is [as follows]: Rabbi Yosei the Galilean interprets the verses, <italic>Ye shall do</italic> [<italic>no manner of servile work</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn2179">220</xref></sup> and <italic>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2180">221</xref></sup> as meaning that Scripture prohibits the doing of work on all [the days] which are termed &#x201C;the appointed festivals of the Eternal.&#x201D; Thus I might think that they are all alike with respect to this prohibition, and that any manner of servile work is prohibited to be done on [the intermediate days of the festival] just as on the first and eighth days [of Tabernacles], and [then] we would interpret the verses thus: <italic>Ye shall do no manner of servile work. These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2181">222</xref></sup> since a verse may be interpreted together with an antecedent phrase or even together with a penultimate phrase.<sup><xref rid="fn2182">223</xref></sup> It is for this reason that Scripture excludes it by saying, <italic>&#x2018;it&#x2019; is a day of solemn assembly; ye shall do no manner of servile work</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2180">221</xref></sup> meaning: &#x201C;the eighth day [of Tabernacles] is restricted as regards all servile work, but on the intermediate days of the festival the prohibition is not like that of [the eighth day], affecting all manner of &#x2018;servile work,&#x2019; but it is only &#x2018;work&#x2019; which He said they must not do,&#x201D; and [the precise nature of the work forbidden on the intermediate days of the festival] Scripture did not mention, nor did it allude to it at all, but entrusted it to the Sages [to establish which work is permitted and which is prohibited]. The text which Rashi brings [further on in Verse 36]<sup><xref rid="fn2183">224</xref></sup> is also to be explained in this way.</p>
<p>This Beraitha [of the Torath Kohanim] is taught in the Gemara of Tractate Chagigah in the following way:<sup><xref rid="fn2184">225</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Ye shall do no manner of servile work</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2185">226</xref></sup> This teaches us about the intermediate days of the festival, that it is forbidden to do work [on them]. These are the words of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean. Rabbi Akiba says etc.&#x201D; [as quoted above]. And there [in Tractate Chagigah] it is further taught: &#x201C;Just as [servile work] is forbidden on the seventh day [of Passover], so also it is forbidden on the sixth day; if so [I might think], just as the seventh day is restricted with respect to all work,<sup><xref rid="fn2186">227</xref></sup> so also the sixth day [as well as the other intermediate days of the festival] are restricted with respect to all work. Scripture therefore states <italic>&#x2018;ha&#x2019;shvi&#x2019;i&#x2019;</italic>, (<italic>&#x2019;the&#x2019; seventh day</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2187">228</xref></sup> meaning: &#x201C;the seventh day is restricted with regard to all work, but the sixth day is not restricted with respect to all work, for Scripture entrusted [the determining of which work is permitted and which is forbidden] only to the Sages, etc.&#x201D; Now the Gemara states that [on the seventh day of the festival we are] restricted against doing &#x201C;all work,&#x201D; but the Torath Kohanim [mentioned above] states &#x201C;all servile work.&#x201D; This is because in the interpretation [of the Gemara] the Sages chose the wording of the Scriptural text [and since in Deuteronomy 16:8 it says with reference to the seventh day of Passover, <italic>thou shalt do no &#x2018;work&#x2019; therein</italic>, the Gemara followed that expression, but the intention is really only to &#x201C;servile work&#x201D;], for with respect to a festival it cannot be said that &#x201C;all work&#x201D; is forbidden therein, but only &#x201C;all servile work.&#x201D; Thus both [the Torath Kohanim and the Gemara] meant the same thing, namely, that on the festival days all manner of servile work is forbidden, but on the intermediate days of the festival all manner of servile work is not forbidden; however, forbidden are those kinds of labor which [although] have not been set forth in the Torah, but which Scripture entrusted to the Sages [to be specified as forbidden].</p>
<p>And in the Sifre [we have been taught]:<sup><xref rid="fn2188">229</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Yishmael says: Since we have not been instructed that on the intermediate days of a festival it is forbidden to do work, therefore Scripture states, <italic>Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2173">214</xref></sup> [thus teaching that] just as the seventh day is restricted [as regarding work], so also is the sixth day [and all intermediate days of the festival] restricted. Now I might think that just as the seventh day is restricted with regard to all work, so also is the sixth day restricted with regard to all work. Scripture therefore states <italic>&#x2018;the&#x2019; seventh day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2187">228</xref></sup> thus teaching that the seventh day is restricted with regard to all work, but the sixth day is not restricted with respect to all work.&#x201D; This Beraitha too [speaking of &#x201C;all work&#x201D; being prohibited on the seventh day of Passover] is to be explained in accordance with the principle we have laid down [i.e., that the intention is &#x201C;all servile work,&#x201D; the Beraitha merely following the language of the verse, as explained above]. Thus we have discussed at length the matter of the Beraithoth dealing with this subject, in order that the words of our Rabbis, of blessed memory, should conform with the clear and correct interpretation which we have said of these verses.</p>
<p>Yet despite all this, I have found a contradiction to our words from a Beraitha taught in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn2189">230</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Ye shall do no manner of &#x2018;m&#x2019;lecheth avodah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>servile work</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2190">231</xref></sup> This teaches that the doing of work [on the first day of Passover] is forbidden. How do we know that the preparation of food is permitted thereon? Here it is stated <italic>a holy convocation</italic> [<italic>In the first day shall be &#x2018;a holy convocation&#x2019;; ye shall do no manner of servile work</italic>], and there<sup><xref rid="fn2191">232</xref></sup> it is said [with respect to the same day] <italic>a holy convocation</italic>. Now just as there [the verse explicitly] permits preparing food, so here too the intention is to permit the preparation of food [on the same day].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2192">233</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears to me that the term <italic>avodah</italic> was understood by our Rabbis, of blessed memory, in the sense of labor and toil which one does for another, [the usage being] similar to these expressions: <italic>&#x2018;avodath aved&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the work of a bondservant</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn2193">234</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;eved avadim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a servant of servants</italic>) <italic>shall he be unto his brethren;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2194">235</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;avdu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>they served</italic>) <italic>Chedorlaomer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2195">236</xref></sup> Similarly: <italic>&#x2018;avodath avodah va&#x2019;avodath masa&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the work of service, and the work of bearing burdens</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2196">237</xref></sup> which means the work of any task in the Tent [of Meeting], and the work of [bearing] burdens upon the shoulder. If so, it would be possible [to think] that light works which one does for one&#x2019;s own enjoyment are permissible, even though they are not for the preparation of food, while those difficult labors done in the course of preparation of food, which a servant performs for his master, are forbidden to be done. Therefore this [Beraitha just quoted from the Sifre] asked: &#x201C;Whence do we know that this permission [for certain works] refers to preparation of food, so that all work done in the preparation of food is permissible, even if it involves difficult labor, and that we should prohibit all other kinds of work, for even the easiest of them are called <italic>m&#x2019;lecheth avodah</italic>? From the similarity of phrases, <italic>a holy convocation</italic>, for there<sup><xref rid="fn2191">232</xref></sup> it is indicated that all works [even easy ones] are prohibited, and all works done for the preparation of food [even those difficult tasks that a servant does for his master, such as cooking, baking, etc.] are permitted to be done.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now I have seen the following text taught in the Mechilta:<sup><xref rid="fn2197">238</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2191">232</xref></sup> All works necessary for the preparation of food overrule the festival, but not all Services [in the Sanctuary, as will be explained] overrule the festival. Now [the argument may be advanced]: Let some works done for the preparation of food overrule the Sabbath&#x0021; And the following reasoning would favor it: If in a situation when all Services do not overrule the festival, nonetheless all works necessary for the preparation of food do overrule the festival, then in the situation where some Services [in the Sanctuary] do overrule the Sabbath, is it not logical that some works done for the preparation of food overrule the Sabbath&#x0021; Scripture therefore states, <italic>Save that which every man must eat</italic>, [<italic>that only may be done by you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2191">232</xref></sup> &#x2014; on the festival, but not on the Sabbath. It is thus established that although] some Services [in the Sanctuary] overrule the Sabbath, no work for the preparation of food may overrule the Sabbath.&#x201D; Now the meaning of the phrase [in the Beraitha] &#x201C;some Services [in the Sanctuary which overrule the Sabbath],&#x201D; is such things as offerings which are obligatory for the day, these being the Daily Whole-offering and the Additional Offerings; &#x201C;but the festival is not overruled by all Services [in the Sanctuary],&#x201D; these are vow-offerings and freewill-offerings [of individuals], or a freewill burnt-offering [which, although wholly for the altar, may yet not be offered on a festival]. But the meaning of the phrase [&#x201C;is it not logical that] <italic>some</italic> works for the preparation of food [overrule the Sabbath]&#x201D; has not been clarified to me. However, it alludes to what we have said, that work which is accomplished by means of great toil, akin to work [which a servant does for his master], is included in the prohibition, but that which is accomplished easily, and is customary for a man to do for himself, is permitted; or &#x201C;some works&#x201D; may mean [those necessary] for maintenance of life, and &#x201C;all works&#x201D; may mean abundance of dishes for pleasure. The principle then of <italic>&#x2018;m&#x2019;lecheth avodah&#x2019;</italic> [servile work &#x2014; stated in the case of the festivals], is thus to permit the preparation of food [since that is not within the terms of &#x201C;servile work&#x201D; which is forbidden on the festival].</p>
<p>8. AND YE SHALL BRING AN OFFERING MADE BY FIRE UNTO THE ETERNAL SEVEN DAYS. Scripture is stating that all seven days [of Passover] should be a festival <italic>to bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2198">239</xref></sup> but not that they are all equally forbidden as far as doing work, like on the first and seventh days. He did not explain [here the precise nature of] the offering, since He is going to mention it in a special section dealing with all the offerings of the festivals,<sup><xref rid="fn2125">166</xref></sup> when it is His wish that they should be binding on the children of Israel, and as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2199">240</xref></sup> And the interpretation of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn2200">241</xref></sup> is that [the intention of the verse here] is to state that we are to bring an offering under all circumstances, even if we do not have all the [required] Additional Offerings. This is a correct [explanation].</p>
<p>10. SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN YE ARE COME INTO THE LAND. Since He establishes a new commandment here in connection with each of the festivals, in addition to their being days of rest and holy convocation, therefore He singled out for each festival a special section, which begins with the charge, <italic>Speak unto the children of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2201">242</xref></sup> And since the time of the Festival of Weeks is dependent upon the <italic>omer</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2202">243</xref></sup> therefore He stated it all in one section. And because the Day of Remembrance [i.e., the New Year] and the Day of Atonement are in one month [Tishri], and both relate to one subject &#x2014; the [Divine] Judgment concerning man&#x2019;s sins and the atonement [achieved] by those who do repentance &#x2014; therefore He did not say concerning the Day of Atonement &#x201C;speak unto the children of Israel,&#x201D; since the first statement [about the New Year] was sufficient in this case. He made, however, two separate sections [of the <italic>omer</italic> and the Festival of Weeks, as also the New Year and the Day of Atonement], because they are different matters.</p>
<p>AND YE SHALL REAP THE HARVEST THEREOF. This means that you are not to reap <italic>any</italic> harvest in the Land until you have reaped the <italic>omer</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2202">243</xref></sup> and have brought it as <italic>the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest</italic>. Similarly, <italic>from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain shalt thou begin to number seven weeks</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2203">244</xref></sup> means &#x201C;from the time you begin to put the sickle to <italic>any</italic> standing grain, for it is forbidden to raise the sickle over standing grain until the day that you begin to count [seven weeks].&#x201D;</p>
<p>11. ON THE MORROW AFTER &#x2018;HA&#x2019;SHABBATH&#x2019; THE PRIEST SHALL WAVE IT. &#x201C;That is, the morrow after the first day of the Festival of Passover. For if you are to say it means [on the morrow of] the Sabbath of Creation [i.e., the weekly Sabbath], you have no indication which Sabbath is meant.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And indeed, this is the greatest of the proofs mentioned in the Gemara<sup><xref rid="fn2204">245</xref></sup> [to show that <italic>ha&#x2019;shabbath</italic> here is not to be interpreted literally as meaning the weekly Sabbath, but refers to the first day of Passover]; for what sense is there for Scripture to state that &#x201C;<italic>when ye are to come into the Land &#x2026; and shall reap the harvest thereof ye</italic> shall bring the sheaf on the morrow of the weekly Sabbath,&#x201D; which would mean that at any time of the year when we come into the Land and reap its harvest, the priest shall wave the sheaf on the morrow of the first Sabbath after we have come into the Land&#x0021; In that case the Festival of Weeks would have no [definite] starting point from which we are to count [the forty-nine days, so that on the fiftieth day we should celebrate that festival]&#x0021; Moreover, according to this way we would not know even in the years following [our entrance into the Land] when we are to begin counting [the forty-nine days], but only from the day that we first put the sickle to the standing grain at our will. But these are meaningless words&#x0021; If, however, the expression <italic>on the morrow after &#x2018;ha&#x2019;shabbath&#x2019;</italic> means &#x201C;on the morrow after [the first day of] the festival,&#x201D; in accordance with the tradition of our Rabbis, then the matter appears correctly. For at first Scripture commanded that we should observe in the first month the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days,<sup><xref rid="fn2205">246</xref></sup> and that on the first day there should be a solemn rest and on the seventh day a solemn rest,<sup><xref rid="fn2206">247</xref></sup> and we are not to do thereon any manner of servile work. Afterwards He stated that when we come into the Land we are to bring on the morrow of this rest-day [previously] mentioned, <italic>the sheaf of the waving</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2207">248</xref></sup> this being the first rest-day here mentioned. And He also taught that the [bringing of the] sheaf was not obligatory in the desert, nor outside the Land [since the section begins, <italic>When ye are come into the Land</italic> &#x2026; ]. However, the expressions, <italic>even unto the morrow after &#x2018;ha&#x2019;shabbath&#x2019; the seventh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2208">249</xref></sup> and <italic>seven &#x2018;shabbathoth&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2207">248</xref></sup> cannot possibly be interpreted as referring to a festival [as does the expression <italic>on the morrow after &#x2018;ha&#x2019;shabbath&#x2019;</italic> here in Verse 11 and also further in Verse 15.] Onkelos, however, rendered them as meaning &#x201C;week&#x201D;, but if so, there are two different usages of the same word in one verse&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn2209">250</xref></sup> And the commentators<sup><xref rid="fn2210">251</xref></sup> have written that this is a literary expression [Scripture using one term in the same instance with two different meanings], such as: <italic>they rode on thirty &#x2018;a&#x2019;yarim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>ass colts</italic>) <italic>and they had thirty &#x2018;a&#x2019;yarim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>cities</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2211">252</xref></sup> And in another place Scripture clearly states, <italic>Seven weeks shalt thou number</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2203">244</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>those that were to come in on &#x2018;ha&#x2019;shabbath,&#x2019; with those that were to go out on &#x2018;ha&#x2019;shabbath,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2212">253</xref></sup> [where both <italic>ha&#x2019;shabbath</italic> mean] &#x201C;week.&#x201D; Likewise, <italic>Saying: &#x2018;When will the New Moon be gone, that we may sell grain, &#x2018;v&#x2019;ha&#x2019;shabbath,&#x2019; that we may set forth corn?&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2213">254</xref></sup> [also means &#x201C;and the week&#x201D;], for since every seven days contain one Sabbath, and the enumeration of the days is with reference to it [the Sabbath],<sup><xref rid="fn2214">255</xref></sup> therefore one week is called &#x201C;one <italic>shabbath</italic>&#x201D;, this usage being well-known and common in the words of our Rabbis, such as: &#x201C;for twice <italic>b&#x2019;shabbath</italic> (in the week) the court sits in towns [on Mondays and on Thursdays].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2215">256</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that every <italic>shabbath</italic> mentioned [here] in the section means &#x201C;week.&#x201D; And the meaning of the expression <italic>on the morrow after &#x2018;ha&#x2019;shabbath&#x2019;</italic> is that on the day of the waving of the sheaf they should begin counting the week, and if so, that day will be &#x201C;on the morrow after the week&#x201D; which has passed, it being as if He had said: &#x201C;The day of the waving of the sheaf shall be on the morrow after the week with relation to the days that have passed by, and the first with reference to the weeks which he is to count until he finishes seven weeks.&#x201D; And since He mentioned the expression, <italic>and on the fifteenth day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2216">257</xref></sup> He thus states that [the priest] should wave the sheaf on the morrow after the week mentioned, and count therefrom seven weeks. One cannot mistake the expression [<italic>ha&#x2019;shabbath</italic>] as referring to the <italic>fourteenth</italic> day [of Nisan, thus making the offering of the <italic>omer</italic>, brought on the morrow, to be on the <italic>fifteenth</italic> day of Nisan, the first day of Passover], for of that fourteenth day He has said that only <italic>at dusk</italic> [<italic>is the Eternal&#x2019;s Passover</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2217">258</xref></sup> And the meaning of <italic>they shall be complete</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2207">248</xref></sup> is that a Sabbath together with its six days is called &#x201C;a whole&#x201D; Sabbath. And the meaning of the expression <italic>mimachorath ha&#x2019;shabbath</italic> [literally: &#x201C;<italic>from</italic> the morrow of the <italic>shabbath</italic>&#x201D;] is like <italic>b&#x2019;machorath ha&#x2019;shabbath</italic> (&#x201C;<italic>on</italic> the morrow of the <italic>shabbath</italic>&#x201D;). Similarly, <italic>Even unto &#x2018;mimachorath ha&#x2019;shabbath&#x2019; the seventh, shall ye number</italic> [<italic>fifty days</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn2218">259</xref></sup> [is like <italic>b&#x2019;machorath ha&#x2019;shabbath</italic> (&#x201C;<italic>on</italic> the morrow of the <italic>shabbath</italic>&#x201D;)] So also: <italic>It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it u&#x2019;mimachorath</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2219">260</xref></sup> [literally: &#x201C;and <italic>from</italic> the morrow,&#x201D; means <italic>u&#x2019;b&#x2019;machorath</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;and <italic>on</italic> the morrow]. Scholars<sup><xref rid="fn2220">261</xref></sup> have said that the letter <italic>beth</italic> cannot occur as a prefix in the word <italic>machar</italic> (tomorrow) or <italic>machorath</italic> (the morrow). [Therefore it states], <italic>And it came to pass &#x2018;mimachorath&#x2019;</italic> [literally: &#x201C;<italic>from</italic> the morrow&#x201D;] <italic>that Moses sat to judge the people</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2221">262</xref></sup> [which means &#x201C;<italic>on</italic> the morrow&#x201D;]. <italic>And the Eternal did that thing &#x2018;mimachorath&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2222">263</xref></sup> [literally: &#x201C;<italic>from</italic> the morrow,&#x201D; which means &#x201C;<italic>on</italic> the morrow&#x201D;], and similarly all such expressions.</p>
<p>15. AND YE SHALL COUNT &#x2018;LACHEM&#x2019; (UNTO YOU). The meaning thereof is similar to the expression <italic>And ye shall take &#x2018;lachem,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2223">264</xref></sup> thus establishing that the counting [of the forty-nine days of the <italic>omer</italic>] and the taking [of the <italic>lulav, ethrog</italic> etc. on the Festival of Tabernacles] be done by each and every person. Thus the counting must be done by word of mouth, and he should mention the number, just as our Rabbis have received it by tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn2224">265</xref></sup> This is unlike the expressions <italic>and he shall count &#x2018;lo&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>to himself</italic>) <italic>seven days for his cleansing;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2225">266</xref></sup> <italic>then she shall number &#x2018;lah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>to herself</italic>) seven days<sup><xref rid="fn2226">267</xref></sup> [referring to a man or woman who suffered a flux, in which case the counting of the clean days does not have to be uttered by word of mouth], because if they so wish, they may remain in their impurity; they must only beware not to forget their impurity [and enter the Sanctuary or eat holy food in a state of defilement, which Scripture strongly forbids].<sup><xref rid="fn2227">268</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>And thou shall number &#x2018;lecha&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>unto thee</italic>) <italic>seven Sabbaths of years</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2228">269</xref></sup> of the Jubilee, means [only] that you shall be heedful of the number so that you should not forget [when the Jubilee year falls, but the actual counting of the years does not have to be by word of mouth]. But in the Torath Kohanim I have found it said:<sup><xref rid="fn2229">270</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And thou shalt number unto thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2228">269</xref></sup> &#x2014; in the court.&#x201D; Now I do not know if the intention is to state that the Great Court [of seventy-one judges] is obliged [actually] to count the years and the Sabbatical cycles<sup><xref rid="fn2230">271</xref></sup> at the beginning of every year, and to recite a benediction before the counting as we do at the counting [of the forty-nine days] of the <italic>omer</italic>; or it may be that the intention [of the Torath Kohanim] is to state that the court should be careful in the counting of the years, and sanctify the fiftieth year.<sup><xref rid="fn2231">272</xref></sup> Thus the number of days from the day of the waving of the <italic>omer</italic> until the day of <italic>the holy convocation</italic> [i.e., the Festival of Weeks], is identical to the number of years of the [seven] Sabbatical cycles until the Jubilee, and the reason for them is the same. Therefore <italic>ye shall number fifty days</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2208">249</xref></sup> which means that one is to count seven weeks [comprising] forty-nine days,<sup><xref rid="fn2232">273</xref></sup> and sanctify the fiftieth day which he has counted [and make it a holy convocation], just as He said with respect to the Jubilee.<sup><xref rid="fn2228">269</xref></sup> This is the meaning of the word <italic>t&#x2019;mimoth</italic> (complete) &#x2014; [<italic>seven weeks shall there be &#x2018;complete&#x2019;</italic>], meaning that they be exactly that number, no less and no more, just as is the meaning of the expression: <italic>they shall be perfect</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2233">274</xref></sup> for anything additional or missing makes a thing imperfect.<sup><xref rid="fn2234">275</xref></sup> Thus the explanation of this section is that we are to begin counting the days <italic>in the beginning of the barley harvest</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2235">276</xref></sup> and bring of the first fruits of the harvest, <italic>of the fresh ears</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2236">277</xref></sup> a meal-offering unto the Eternal, and also to offer up with it an offering,<sup><xref rid="fn2237">278</xref></sup> and to finish the counting of the days in the beginning of the corn harvest, <italic>as a shock of grain cometh up in its season</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2238">279</xref></sup> and bring of it a meal-offering of fine corn flour unto the Eternal, and to offer with it also an offering.<sup><xref rid="fn2239">280</xref></sup> This is the reason why He mentioned these offerings in this section, because they are brought on account of the meal-offerings which are the main [commandment] of these festivals, but He did not mention the Additional Offerings brought on these festivals [which are enumerated in the Book of Numbers],<sup><xref rid="fn2240">281</xref></sup> even as He did not mention those of the rest of the festivals.</p>
<p>16. AND YE SHALL OFFER A NEW MEAL-OFFERING UNTO THE ETERNAL. The meaning of the expression <italic>a new meal-offering</italic> is that no meal-offering [of the new crop] is to be brought into G-d&#x2019;s House until they bring this one, as our Rabbis have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2241">282</xref></sup> It was necessary for Scripture to state, <italic>it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2242">283</xref></sup> with reference to the prohibition of [eating of] the new crop and the command to rest [from work] on the Festival of Weeks,<sup><xref rid="fn2243">284</xref></sup> because [the prohibition of eating of the new crop] depends on the waving of the sheaf,<sup><xref rid="fn2244">285</xref></sup> [and the Festival of Weeks is connected] with <italic>the new meal-offering</italic> [mentioned in the verse before us]. Thus this verse is intended to state that even after our exile to countries outside the Land, when the <italic>omer</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2202">243</xref></sup> and the [new] meal-offering are no longer offered, He nonetheless commanded concerning the observance [of the law of the new crop and resting on the festival], for the [prohibition against eating of the] new crop applies by law of the Torah in all places. It was not necessary to mention this in connection with the Day of Remembrance [i.e., the New Year], and similarly in connection with the Festival of Tabernacles He did not mention [that it is to be observed] &#x201C;in all your dwellings&#x201D; [because these two festivals are clearly not dependent upon the offerings in the Sanctuary]. He did, however, mention it with reference to the Day of Atonement,<sup><xref rid="fn2245">286</xref></sup> because since He had made our atonement dependent upon the offerings, as he mentioned in the section of <italic>Acharei Moth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2246">287</xref></sup> therefore He said here that the prohibition [of eating and working on that day] applies in all places [and at all times], as He stated <italic>it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2247">288</xref></sup> by fasting and resting from work, and [the absence of] the offerings does not prevent His [granting of] atonement. Similarly He did not mention here with reference to the Festival of Unleavened Bread: &#x201C;it is a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations,&#x201D; but in the section of <italic>This month shall be unto you the beginning of months</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2248">289</xref></sup> He did mention it,<sup><xref rid="fn2249">290</xref></sup> because since He had made there the matter dependent upon the Passover-offering, as it is said, <italic>and unleavened bread with bitter herbs they shall eat it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2250">291</xref></sup> therefore He had to state that [the Festival of Unleavened Bread] is <italic>an ordinance forever</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2251">292</xref></sup> <italic>in all your habitations</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2252">293</xref></sup> He mentioned [here] with reference to the Sabbath that it is to be observed <italic>in all your dwellings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2253">294</xref></sup> because since He had permitted work in the Sanctuary in the bringing of the Daily Whole-offering and the Additional Offerings, therefore He said that the prohibition [of work on the Sabbath] applies in all our dwelling places; for the intention of that expression is only to state: &#x201C;<italic>in all your dwelling places</italic>, but not in the House of the Eternal.&#x201D; And so the Rabbis have said in the Mechilta:<sup><xref rid="fn2254">295</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Ye shall kindle no fire in your dwelling places</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2255">296</xref></sup> In your dwelling places you may not kindle a fire, but you may kindle it in the Sanctuary.&#x201D; Similarly it says with reference to the prohibition of [eating] fat or blood, <italic>It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2256">297</xref></sup> because it was prohibited on account of the offerings, [therefore He stated that this prohibition is nonetheless independent of the offerings, and applies always and everywhere]. And so the Rabbis have said in Tractate Kiddushin:<sup><xref rid="fn2257">298</xref></sup> &#x201C;Why did the Merciful One write the expression <italic>in all your dwellings</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2256">297</xref></sup> in connection with [the prohibition against eating] fat or blood? It is because I might have thought that since this prohibition is written in connection with the offerings, therefore when there are offerings [i.e., when the Sanctuary is in existence] the prohibition is applicable, and when there are no offerings it is not applicable, thus the Torah wanted to teach us [that it is always applicable].&#x201D; There [in Tractate Kiddushin]<sup><xref rid="fn2257">298</xref></sup> the Rabbis also said: &#x201C;Why did the Merciful One write [here in this section &#x2014; in Verse 3] the expression <italic>in all your dwellings</italic> with reference to the Sabbath? It is because I might have thought that since it is written in connection with the festivals, the Sabbath should require sanctification by the court just as the festivals do, therefore the Torah wanted to teach us [that the Sabbath is independent of sanctification by the court]. The principle then is that the Torah does not mention this expression [<italic>in all your dwellings</italic>] with reference to any commandment which is a personal obligation, unless there is a necessity for some reason.</p>
<p>Now the expression: <italic>&#x2018;out of your dwellings&#x2019; ye shall bring two wave-loaves</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2258">299</xref></sup> [on the Festival of Weeks], is not similar to &#x201C;out of <italic>all</italic> your dwellings.&#x201D; Rather, its meaning is: &#x201C;<italic>out of</italic> the Land of <italic>your dwellings</italic>,&#x201D; excluding [the obligation to bring two loaves from the produce of] outside the Land of Israel, just as it is said, <italic>When ye come into the Land of your habitations which I give unto you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2259">300</xref></sup> And so the Rabbis have taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup><xref rid="fn2260">301</xref></sup> &#x201C;All the [meal-]offerings of the public or of an individual may come from the produce of the Land or outside the Land, save only the <italic>omer</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2202">243</xref></sup> and the two loaves.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2258">299</xref></sup> And even according to the Sage who says<sup><xref rid="fn2261">302</xref></sup> that the <italic>omer</italic> may be brought from the produce of outside the Land, he admits in the case of the two loaves [brought on the Festival of Weeks] that they may be offered only from what is grown within the Land [of Israel].</p>
<p>17. THEY SHALL BE BAKED WITH LEAVEN. Scripture commanded that these two loaves be leavened, because they are a thanks-offering to G-d for having kept for us <italic>the appointed time of the harvest</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2262">303</xref></sup> and a thanks-offering comes <italic>with cakes of leavened bread</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2263">304</xref></sup> Perhaps the [usual] prohibition of bringing leavened things as an offering<sup><xref rid="fn2264">305</xref></sup> is because leaven alludes to the attribute of justice, for it is called <italic>chametz</italic> (leaven), just as wine which sours is called <italic>&#x2018;chometz yayin v&#x2019;chometz sheichar&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2265">306</xref></sup> the word [<italic>chametz</italic>] being derived from the expression: <italic>the unrighteous &#x2018;v&#x2019;chomeitz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and ruthless man</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2266">307</xref></sup> for [vinegar of wine and vinegar of strong drink] are drinks whose original taste has been &#x201C;robbed&#x201D; from them, and they are therefore not suitable for [normal] drinking. Similarly, <italic>for my heart yithchameitz&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2267">308</xref></sup> means that it was &#x201C;in a ferment, and it lost its composure.&#x201D; Now since the offerings are brought to be acceptable before <italic>the Glorious Name</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2268">309</xref></sup> they are therefore not to be brought from objects which possess a strong power<sup><xref rid="fn2269">310</xref></sup> to change natural properties of other things [such as leaven], and similarly they are not to be brought from things which are completely sweet<sup><xref rid="fn2270">311</xref></sup> such as honey. [Instead, they are to come] only from things which are blended of different qualities, just as the Rabbis have said with reference to the creation of the world<sup><xref rid="fn2271">312</xref></sup> &#x201C;He combined the attribute of mercy with the attribute of justice, and created the world.&#x201D; Now on the Festival of Weeks which is the day of the Giving of the Torah [on Mount Sinai], the offering [i.e., the two <italic>leavened</italic> loaves and the various burnt-offerings, together with their meal-offering which is of <italic>unleavened</italic> bread, as stated in Verse 18] comes in accordance with the law of the thanks-offering [which was brought with ten <italic>leavened</italic> cakes and thirty <italic>unleavened</italic> cakes],<sup><xref rid="fn2272">313</xref></sup> for it is the day of the solemn assembly. The student learned in the mysteries of the Cabala will understand. And this is the secret of which our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2273">314</xref></sup> &#x201C;All offerings are destined to cease [in the World to Come],<sup><xref rid="fn2274">315</xref></sup> but the thanks-offering will never cease etc.,&#x201D; for in it are both unleavened and leavened [cakes], comparable to the World to Come [in which the Divine attributes of justice and mercy will forever be in perfect harmony].</p>
<p>22. AND WHEN YE REAP THE HARVEST OF YOUR LAND, THOU SHALT NOT WHOLLY REAP THE CORNER OF THY FIELD, NEITHER SHALT THOU GATHER THY GLEANING OF THY HARVEST: THOU SHALT LEAVE THEM FOR THE POOR. Rashi comments: &#x201C;He repeats once more these prohibitions [although they have been mentioned above, 19:9] in order to make one liable for transgressing two negative commandments [in each case].&#x201D; And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that the reason [for the repetition] is because the Festival of Weeks is the day on which <italic>the first-fruits of wheat harvest</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2275">316</xref></sup> [are brought as a meal-offering, in the form of the two leavened loaves], therefore He warned that &#x201C;you should not forget what I have commanded you to do in those days.&#x201D; The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the expression, <italic>And when ye reap the harvest of your Land</italic> alludes to &#x201C;the harvest&#x201D; mentioned at the beginning of this section,<sup><xref rid="fn2276">317</xref></sup> thus stating that when you will come into the Land and you reap the sheaf, <italic>the first-fruits of your harvest</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2276">317</xref></sup> <italic>thou shalt not wholly r,eap the corner</italic> of that field for the sake of the sheaf, neither shall you gather the gleaning, meaning to say that this commandment [of bringing the <italic>omer</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2202">243</xref></sup>] does not override these negative commandments.</p>
<p>24. IT SHALL BE UNTO YOU &#x2018;SHABBATHON&#x2019; (A SOLEMN REST). This means that it is to be a day of rest, to repose thereon [from work]. And our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2277">318</xref></sup> &#x201C;The word <italic>shabbathon</italic> (a solemn rest) amounts to a positive commandment.&#x201D; Thus one who does work on a festival day transgresses both a negative commandment and a positive commandment, and one who rests thereon fulfills a positive commandment. And in their opinion [that of the Rabbis],<sup><xref rid="fn2278">319</xref></sup> all the festivals have been likened one to another,<sup><xref rid="fn2279">320</xref></sup> for the word <italic>shabbathon</italic> is not mentioned in connection with the Festival of Unleavened Bread, nor in connection with the Festival of Weeks.</p>
<p>Now in the Mechilta on the section of <italic>Hachodesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2280">321</xref></sup> I have seen the following text:<sup><xref rid="fn2281">322</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And ye shall observe this day</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2282">323</xref></sup> Why is this said? Has it not already been stated, <italic>no manner of work shall be done in them?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2283">324</xref></sup> From this I would know only about matters which are considered <italic>m&#x2019;lachah</italic> [&#x2019;work&#x2019; on the Sabbath, and thus forbidden by the Torah]. How do I know about activities which are termed <italic>sh&#x2019;vuth</italic> [as explained later on]? From the verse which states, <italic>and ye shall observe this day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2282">323</xref></sup> which includes those activities which are termed <italic>sh&#x2019;vuth</italic>. I might then think that on the intermediate days of the festival those activities known as <italic>sh&#x2019;vuth</italic> are likewise forbidden, and the following reasoning would favor it etc;<sup><xref rid="fn2284">325</xref></sup> Scripture therefore states [with reference to the Festival of Tabernacles], <italic>On the first day shall be a solemn rest</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2285">326</xref></sup> [but not on the following intermediate days of the festival].</p>
<p>Thus the Sages interpreted the word <italic>shabbathon</italic> as indicating a complete rest on that day, desisting even from those activities which are not of the chief labors or their derivatives. But this interpretation is not clear to me. For if you say that this Mechilta is a mere Scriptural support for a Rabbinic ordinance, what reason is there for the Rabbis to use this language [i.e., &#x201C;How do I know about activities which are termed <italic>sh&#x2019;vuth</italic>?&#x201D; when instead they should have said, &#x201C;How do I know about activities which are not regarded as <italic>m&#x2019;lachah?</italic>&#x201D;], for the term <italic>sh&#x2019;vuth</italic> in the language of the Sages is always used with reference to activities forbidden by the Rabbis; and so how is it possible to say, &#x201C;How do I know that activities which are forbidden on account of <italic>sh&#x2019;vuth</italic> instituted by the Rabbis, are forbidden on the basis of a verse [in Scripture]&#x0021;&#x201D; The way in which such [Beraithoth make use of] Scriptural texts as a support for Rabbinical enactments, is by teaching [an interpretation in a verse] showing that they [such Rabbinical enactments] are based on the Torah, but they never say, &#x201C;That activity which is forbidden by the Sages, from what verse in the Torah do we derive it?&#x201D; Instead, this [Beraitha of the Mechilta] should have stated, &#x201C;Activities which are not in the category of <italic>m&#x2019;lachah</italic> (&#x2018;work&#x2019;),<sup><xref rid="fn2286">327</xref></sup> whence do we know that they are forbidden? From the word <italic>shabbathon</italic>&#x0021;&#x201D;</p>
<p>It appears to me that this interpretation intends to state that we are commanded by law of the Torah to have rest on a festival day even from activities which are not in the category of <italic>m&#x2019;lachah</italic> (&#x201C;work&#x201D;).<sup><xref rid="fn2286">327</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus we are not to be engaged the whole day in wearisome tasks: measuring out crops of the field, weighing fruits and gifts, filling the barrels with wine and clearing away the vessels, and moving stones from house to house and from place to place [although none of these activities is &#x201C;work&#x201D; in the strict sense of the term]. Similarly, if it be a city encompassed by a wall and its gates are locked at night, [and it is therefore according to law of the Torah treated as one domain, and the prohibition against taking out aught from one domain to another is inapplicable there], they would be loading heaps on asses, <italic>as also wine, grapes, and figs and all manner of burdens</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2287">328</xref></sup> they would bring on a festival; and the market place would be full for all business transactions, the shops standing open and the shopkeepers giving credit,<sup><xref rid="fn2288">329</xref></sup> the money-changers sitting before their tables with the golden coins before them, and the workers would rise early to go to their work and hire themselves out for such works [as described above] just as on weekdays, and so on&#x0021; And since all these matters do not entail <italic>m&#x2019;lachah</italic>, they would be permissible on a festival day and even on the Sabbath itself&#x0021; Therefore the Torah said that [the festival should be a day of] <italic>shabbathon</italic> (solemn rest), meaning that it should be a day of rest and ease, not a day of labor [and weariness]. This is a good and beautiful interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn2289">330</xref></sup></p>
<p>Afterwards I saw the other Mechilta of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai<sup><xref rid="fn2290">331</xref></sup> where it is taught in another form: &#x201C;I know only that it is forbidden [on a festival day to do] the kind of work for which, [if transgressed on the Sabbath through error], one must bring a sin-offering. How do I know that [it is forbidden to do] such works [on a festival day] for which one does not have to bring a sin-offering [if transgressed through error on the Sabbath], such as climbing a tree or riding on animals or swimming in the water, or slapping one&#x2019;s thighs or clapping one&#x2019;s hands? From the verse, <italic>no manner of work shall be done in them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2291">332</xref></sup> I know only concerning acts of [one&#x2019;s own] choice. How do I know concerning acts commanded [in the Torah], that we may not dedicate anything [to the Temple treasury], or make a vow of valuation, or devote anything [for Temple repairs, or for the priests], or set apart the heave-offering or the tithes? From the expression <italic>shabbathon</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2292">333</xref></sup> which means <italic>sh&#x2019;vuth</italic>&#x201D; (rest, abstention from ordinary occupation). In a similar way this [Beraitha] is taught in the Torath Kohanim with reference to the Day of Atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn2293">334</xref></sup> Now although these Beraithoth<sup><xref rid="fn2294">335</xref></sup> differ in their language and in their interpretations, perhaps they all intend one common thing, namely, to find some Scriptural support for activities forbidden by the Rabbis. But nonetheless, whether the interpretation of the first Beraitha [mentioned above] be as we have said [i.e., that it is forbidden by <italic>Scriptural law</italic> to do on a festival day activities which are not strictly speaking &#x201C;work,&#x201D; but are wearisome labors], or whether all [these Beraithoth] intend only to find a Scriptural support for matters forbidden by the Rabbis, the meaning of the term <italic>shabbathon</italic> is as we have explained, namely, that we should have a day of repose from labor and toil. This is indeed a very proper and excellent interpretation.</p>
<p>Thus we have been prohibited from doing [any of the main classes of] &#x201C;work&#x201D; on the Sabbath by a negative commandment,<sup><xref rid="fn2295">336</xref></sup> and [for the intentional transgression thereof is prescribed] the punishment of excision [if the court has no knowledge of the transgression or there are no witnesses, but if there are witnesses who testify, the punishment] is death &#x2014; but as for labors and toils [which are not strictly speaking &#x201C;work&#x201D;], we are commanded by means of this positive commandment;<sup><xref rid="fn2296">337</xref></sup> and on a festival day we are prohibited from doing &#x201C;work&#x201D; by a negative commandment, [the punishment for the intentional transgression thereof being whipping], and the doing of labors [which are not strictly speaking &#x201C;work&#x201D;] we are forbidden by means of a positive commandment. It is on this basis that the prophet [Isaiah] said, <italic>If thou turn away thy foot because of the Sabbath, from pursuing thy business on My holy day &#x2026; not doing thy wonted ways, nor pursuing thy business, nor speaking thereof;</italic> [<italic>then shalt thou delight thyself in the Eternal</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2297">338</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>a Sabbath of &#x2018;shabbathon&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>solemn rest</italic>) <italic>shall be for the Land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2298">339</xref></sup> means that [the seventh year] shall be a Sabbath of rest, that one is not to plow nor cultivate the Land at all. It is because of this that the Sages have interpreted [in the first Beraitha mentioned above] that on the intermediate days of the festival those activities known as <italic>sh&#x2019;vuth</italic> are not forbidden. But this is only according to the law of the Torah, for by Rabbinic enactment whatever one may not do oneself one is not permitted to say to a non-Jew to do, since even with reference to the Rabbinic prohibition against telling [a non-Jew to do work], the Sages were strict [in not permitting it on an intermediate day of the festival].<sup><xref rid="fn2299">340</xref></sup></p>
<p>A MEMORIAL OF T&#x2019;RUAH&#x2019; (A BLAST OF THE RAM&#x2019;S HORN) &#x2014; &#x201C;[a memorial by means of recitation of] Biblical verses which tell of Divine Remembrance, and verses which have reference to the blowing of the <italic>Shofar</italic> [the ram&#x2019;s horn], so that I shall recall in memory for your sake the Binding of Isaac, instead of whom a ram was offered.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>Now the Rabbi [Rashi] should have mentioned also the Rabbinic interpretation for the recitation of verses in which the Sovereignty of G-d is described,<sup><xref rid="fn2300">341</xref></sup> for it is impossible that Scripture should mention the verses of Divine Remembrance and of the <italic>Shofar</italic>, and should not mention also the verses of Sovereignty. And the Sages have already derived [the duty of reciting] them from the verse, <italic>And they shall be to you for a memorial before your G-d: I am the Eternal your G-d:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2301">342</xref></sup> &#x201C;There was no need for Scripture to state here, <italic>I am the Eternal your G-d</italic>. And why does it state <italic>I am the Eternal your G-d?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2302">343</xref></sup> It is stated only to establish a general law, that wherever you recite verses of Divine Remembrance you recite next to them those of Sovereignty,&#x201D; as it is taught in Torath Kohanim<sup><xref rid="fn2303">344</xref></sup> and in Tractate Rosh Hashanah.<sup><xref rid="fn2304">345</xref></sup> However, all these interpretations are only Scriptural supports for Rabbinic enactments. For the Rabbis have explicitly said:<sup><xref rid="fn2305">346</xref></sup> &#x201C;We are to go to the place where they blow the <italic>Shofar</italic>, and we are not to go to the place where they recite the Service&#x201D; [without the blowing of the <italic>Shofar</italic>. On this statement of the Beraitha the Rabbis of the Gemara asked: ] &#x201C;Surely this is so&#x0021; The blowing of the <italic>Shofar</italic> is commanded by law of the Torah, and the recitation of the verses is only by law of the Rabbis [and what need is there for the Beraitha to teach me that the law of the Torah takes precedence&#x0021;&#x201D; To this the Gemara answered: &#x201C;The Beraitha is] necessary only to teach this in a case where one is certain and one is in doubt.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2306">347</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rather, the expression <italic>a memorial of &#x2018;t&#x2019;ruah&#x2019;</italic> is like the verse, <italic>it shall be a day of &#x2018;t&#x2019;ruah&#x2019; unto you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2307">348</xref></sup> Scripture stating that we are to blow [the <italic>Shofar</italic>] on that day, and this shall be to us for a memorial before G-d, as it is said further on, <italic>and ye shall blow with the trumpets</italic> [<italic>over your burnt-offerings, and over the offerings of your peace-offerings</italic>]<italic>, and they shall be to you for a memorial before your G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2301">342</xref></sup> And since He said there, <italic>And in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in your New Moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the offerings of your peace-offerings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2301">342</xref></sup> whereas here He commanded only a <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic> [a blast of the horn] for this festival [the New Year], and following it He said, <italic>and ye shall bring an offering made by fire</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2308">349</xref></sup> we deduce that this <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic> [mentioned here] is not the same blowing which was done with the [silver] trumpets over the offerings. We furthermore [deduce] that this <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic> here was not done over the offerings, but it is obligatory upon all Israel [wherever they are], and is to be done with the <italic>Shofar</italic> [the ram&#x2019;s horn], for he had not yet commanded him [Moses] to make the trumpets, and all unqualified expressions of <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic> are done with the <italic>Shofar</italic>, as it is said, <italic>And thou shalt make proclamation with &#x2018;shofar t&#x2019;ruah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the blast of the horn</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2309">350</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Scripture did not explain the reason for this commandment, why [we must do] the blowing [of the horn], and why we need a memorial before G-d on this day more than on all other days, and why He commanded altogether that this day should be a holy convocation. But because this day comes at the beginning of the month in which the Day of Atonement occurs, it would appear that on the New Year there is a judgment before Him, blessed be He, <italic>for by these He judgeth the peoples</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2310">351</xref></sup> on the New Year He sits <italic>upon the throne as the righteous Judge</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2311">352</xref></sup> and afterwards in the course of the next ten days He forgives the transgression of His servants.<sup><xref rid="fn2312">353</xref></sup> Scripture is thus alluding to this matter which is well-known in Israel by word of the prophets and our holy ancestors.<sup><xref rid="fn2313">354</xref></sup> And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic> is that which has stood by our fathers and us, as it is said, <italic>Happy is the people that know the &#x2018;t&#x2019;ruah,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2314">355</xref></sup> similar in meaning to that which it is written, <italic>&#x2018;t&#x2019;ruath&#x2019;</italic>(<italic>the alarm of</italic>) <italic>war;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2315">356</xref></sup> for <italic>The Eternal is a man of war</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2316">357</xref></sup> If so, <italic>it shall be a day of &#x2018;t&#x2019;ruah&#x2019; unto you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2307">348</xref></sup> means that the day which is set aside for <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic> [i.e., when the world is judged according to the attribute of justice], will be to our succor [for we will be remembered in mercy].<sup><xref rid="fn2317">358</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>a memorial of &#x2018;t&#x2019;ruah,&#x2019; a holy convocation</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2318">359</xref></sup> means that there will be a remembrance [of mercy] in the <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic> [the quavering sound which alludes to the attribute of justice], and therefore it is <italic>a holy convocation</italic>. It was not necessary for Scripture to mention the <italic>Shofar</italic> [i.e., that &#x201C;it shall be a day of <italic>Shofar</italic> unto you&#x201D;], for the <italic>Shofar</italic> is already alluded to in the word &#x201C;day,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2319">360</xref></sup> and the <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic> is on [that &#x201C;day&#x201D;], and thus it is a day of judgment in mercy, not a <italic>&#x2018;t&#x2019;ruath&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>alarm of</italic>) <italic>war</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2316">357</xref></sup> It is for this reason that Scripture mentioned only the <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic> [but did not mention the <italic>t&#x2019;kioth</italic>, the accompanying plain sounds], because it is already a tradition received by our Rabbis which all Israel have seen [done] as far back as Moses our teacher, that each <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic> (quavering sound) has one plain accompanying sound before it and one after it. And why should Scripture mention the <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic>, and not mention the <italic>t&#x2019;kioth</italic> at all, neither in connection with the New Year nor the Day of Atonement [of the Jubilee year]?<sup><xref rid="fn2320">361</xref></sup> But it is because the <italic>t&#x2019;kiah</italic> [the plain accompanying sound] is the memorial, and it is the <italic>Shofar</italic> [all alluding to the attribute of mercy], and the <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic> is as its name indicates [i.e., a reference to the attribute of judgment].<sup><xref rid="fn2321">362</xref></sup> And because it [the <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic>] is wholly surrounded by mercy &#x2014; an accompanying plain sound before it and one after it &#x2014; therefore He said of those <italic>who know the &#x2018;t&#x2019;ruah&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2314">355</xref></sup> that through righteousness they will be exalted, <italic>for Thou art the glory of their strength</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2322">363</xref></sup> Thus it is clear that everything depends upon repentance,<sup><xref rid="fn2323">364</xref></sup> but on the New Year He is concerned entirely with the attribute of justice and conducts His world [by that attribute], and on the Day of Atonement He is concerned entirely with the attribute of mercy. It is this which is expressed in the saying of the Rabbis [with reference to these solemn days]:<sup><xref rid="fn2324">365</xref></sup> &#x201C;The King sitteth upon the throne of judgment etc.&#x201D; Thus the New Year is a day of judgment in mercy, and the Day of Atonement is a day of mercy in judgment.</p>
<p>From that which we have explained about this subject you will understand the sense of the verse written in [the section of] the journeyings [in the wilderness]: <italic>They shall blow &#x2018;t&#x2019;ruah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>an alarm</italic>) <italic>for their journeys. But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2325">366</xref></sup> For of their journeys it is written, <italic>and the angel of G-d journeyed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2326">367</xref></sup> and it is further written, <italic>And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said: &#x2018;Rise up, O Eternal, and let Thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate Thee flee before Thee,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2327">368</xref></sup> which is similar in meaning to the verse, <italic>The face of the Eternal is against them that do evil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2328">369</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>But when the assembly is to be gathered</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2329">370</xref></sup> it is said, <italic>Return, O Eternal, unto the ten thousands</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2330">371</xref></sup> similar in meaning to the verse, <italic>And there was a King in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2331">372</xref></sup> And the ten days between the New Year and the Day of Atonement allude to the Ten Emanations, for on the Day of Atonement He is exalted by them, <italic>and the Eternal of hosts is exalted through justice</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2332">373</xref></sup> as is known in tradition. Furthermore there is also a sign about this in the heavens, for this month of Tishri has as its constellation the zodiac sign of the Balance, thus signifying that in that month <italic>a just balance and scales are set by the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2333">374</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. &#x2018;ACH&#x2019; (BUT) ON THE TENTH DAY OF THIS SEVENTH MONTH IS THE DAY OF ATONEMENT. &#x201C;All expressions in the Torah of <italic>ach</italic> (but) and <italic>rak</italic> (only) indicate limiting qualifications, [and here the word <italic>ach</italic> indicates that the Day of Atonement] effects atonement &#x2018;only&#x2019; for those who repent, but it does not effect atonement for those who do not repent.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language on the basis of the words of our Rabbis.<sup><xref rid="fn2334">375</xref></sup> And if so, the explanation of the verse is that on the first day of this month [Tishri] there will be for all of you a day of <italic>memorial of &#x2018;t&#x2019;ruah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2335">376</xref></sup> [a blowing of the quavering sound which signifies judgment], for you will all be judged then before Him, but for some of you [i.e., those who repent] there will be on the tenth day of this month a day of atonement. Thus the meaning of the word <italic>ach</italic> is like that of <italic>bilvad</italic> (&#x201C;only,&#x201D; &#x201C;alone&#x201D;). Similarly, <italic>Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my son &#x2018;ach&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>only</italic>) <italic>this once</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2336">377</xref></sup> So also, <italic>&#x2018;harak ach b&#x2019;Moshe&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2337">378</xref></sup> means &#x201C;has He indeed spoken &#x2018;only&#x2019; with Moses?&#x201D; Likewise, <italic>&#x2018;Ach&#x2019; on the fifteenth day of the seventh month</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2338">379</xref></sup> means &#x201C;only on the fifteenth day [of Tishri] <italic>ye shall keep the feast of the Eternal seven days</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2338">379</xref></sup> not consecutively,&#x201D; for the Festival-offering [brought by the individual]<sup><xref rid="fn2339">380</xref></sup> does not override the Sabbath [and therefore it cannot mean seven days consecutively]. In the same way you are to explain [the word <italic>ach</italic>] in all the commandments, in accordance with the tradition of our Rabbis. Similarly, <italic>&#x2018;ach&#x2019; he is torn in pieces</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2340">381</xref></sup> means [that Jacob said] that nothing else [could have happened to Joseph] except that he was torn in pieces. So also, <italic>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah &#x2018;ach&#x2019; have done that which was evil in My sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have &#x2018;ach&#x2019; provoked Me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2341">382</xref></sup> means that they have done nothing else.</p>
<p>But by way of the plain meaning of Scripture the word <italic>ach</italic> means <italic>achein</italic> (&#x201C;surely&#x201D;), [a word which is used] to authenticate something, [as in the following expressions]: <italic>&#x2018;achein&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>surely</italic>) <italic>the thing is known;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2342">383</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;achein&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>surely</italic>) <italic>ye shall die like men</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2343">384</xref></sup> And here it means, &#x201C;Surely on the tenth day of the seventh month is the day of atonement,&#x201D; the expression constituting a [Divine] assurance on the authenticity of the matter, Scripture stating: &#x201C;On the first day of the month is the day of judgment, but indeed on the tenth of the month is the day of atonement, therefore you shall afflict your souls, and you shall do no manner of work.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>&#x2018;ach&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>surely</italic>) <italic>thou art my bone and my flesh;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2344">385</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;ach&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>surely</italic>) <italic>it is the king of Israel;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2345">386</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;ach&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>surely</italic>) <italic>G-d is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2346">387</xref></sup> So also is the meaning of the verse, <italic>&#x2018;ach&#x2019; ye shall keep My Sabbaths</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2347">388</xref></sup> which declares: &#x201C;Now I have commanded you concerning the work of the Tabernacle, but surely My Sabbaths you shall keep forever.&#x201D; So also in all cases [where the word <italic>ach</italic> is mentioned] it may be explained to you in this way, if you will understand them.</p>
<p>28. &#x2018;B&#x2019;ETZEM&#x2019; OF THIS DAY. The commentators<sup><xref rid="fn2348">389</xref></sup> have said that the meaning of this phrase is &#x201C;in this selfsame day.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>and ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears until &#x2018;etzem&#x2019; this day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2349">390</xref></sup> means &#x201C;until this selfsame day.&#x201D; So also, <italic>&#x2018;uch&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; the heaven for clearness</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2350">391</xref></sup> means &#x201C;the very&#x201D; heaven. But we cannot interpret that the word <italic>b&#x2019;etzem</italic> here alludes to the essence and power of this day<sup><xref rid="fn2351">392</xref></sup> [which is at daytime], just as our Rabbis have said with reference to the verses: <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; of this day entered Noah</italic> &#x2026; <italic>into the ark</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2352">393</xref></sup> [which the Rabbis interpreted to mean<sup><xref rid="fn2353">394</xref></sup> that because the neighbors threatened to kill him and destroy the ark should they see him entering it, therefore G-d told him to enter it <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; of this day</italic> &#x2014; in broad daylight]; <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; of this day the Eternal did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2354">395</xref></sup> [which the Rabbis similarly interpreted<sup><xref rid="fn2353">394</xref></sup> &#x201C;in broad daylight,&#x201D; because of the previous threats of the Egyptians not to let them go &#x2014; such an interpretation we cannot assume here], for it is written, <italic>and ye shall afflict your souls, in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2355">396</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>And ye shall make proclamation &#x2018;b&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; of this day a holy assembly</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2356">397</xref></sup> [stated with reference to the Festival of Weeks] includes the night as well. Now He did not mention this phrase <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; of this day</italic> with reference to the Sabbath nor the festivals, except for the Festival of Weeks and the Day of Atonement, and so also in the prohibition of <italic>chadash</italic> (the new produce)<sup><xref rid="fn2244">285</xref></sup> He said <italic>until &#x2018;etzem&#x2019; of this day</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2349">390</xref></sup> The reason for this appears to be that since He had said of the Festival of Weeks, <italic>from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the waving</italic> &#x2026; <italic>ye shall number fifty days</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2357">398</xref></sup> and then He stated, <italic>and ye shall present a new meal-offering &#x2026; Ye shall bring out of your dwellings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2358">399</xref></sup> etc., and dealt at length with the commandments of the offerings [in Verses 17-20], therefore it was necessary to state, <italic>And ye shall make proclamation &#x2018;b&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; of this day a solemn assembly;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2356">397</xref></sup> meaning that the very day is holy and the doing of work is forbidden on it, and it is not dependent upon the sheaf [of the waving brought on the second day of Passover], nor on the offerings. Similarly in the case of the Day of Atonement, since He had said, <italic>and ye shall afflict your souls, and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2359">400</xref></sup> and in the section of <italic>Acharei Moth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2360">401</xref></sup> He made the [complete] expiation dependent upon the offerings and on the goat sent [to Azazel],<sup><xref rid="fn2361">402</xref></sup> therefore it was necessary to state here, <italic>And ye shall do no manner of work</italic> on that very day, <italic>for it is a day of atonement</italic> in itself <italic>to make atonement for you</italic>, besides the expiation effected by the offerings. Similarly, <italic>until &#x2018;etzem&#x2019; of this day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2349">390</xref></sup> said in connection with the new produce [means that the prohibition of eating from the new produce continues] up to that very day, which is the day <italic>ye have brought the offering of your G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2349">390</xref></sup> thus stating that even if the [meal-] offering [of the new barley] has not been brought, the commandment applies to that very day &#x2014; so that the new produce<sup><xref rid="fn2244">285</xref></sup> is forbidden before that day and is permissible afterwards. This is the sense of His saying, <italic>it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2349">390</xref></sup> as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2362">403</xref></sup></p>
<p>We further find that Scripture mentions this phrase <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; of this day</italic> in the case of events which have been decreed to come at certain set times. Thus it says of Noah, <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; of this day entered Noah</italic> etc.;<sup><xref rid="fn2352">393</xref></sup> [and in case of the exodus it says,] <italic>And it came to pass &#x2018;b&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; of this day that all the hosts of the Eternal went out from the land of Egypt;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2363">404</xref></sup> [and when Moses was ordered to ascend Mount Nebo it says,] <italic>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses &#x2018;b&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; of that day, saying: &#x2018;Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto Mount Nebo.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2364">405</xref></sup> The reason for this expression in these [three] cases is that it is possible to think that Noah had brought into the ark beforehand many of the beasts and fowls [and on the selfsame day that <italic>he finished</italic> bringing them into the ark, he himself came in]; likewise it is possible [to think] that some Israelites had left Egypt before that time and on that day the exodus was completed, and so also that the command for Moses our teacher&#x2019;s ascension was given before that day, and on that day he actually went up. Therefore Scripture explained in all these [three] cases that [the particular events referred to in the verses] all took place on these selfsame days, not that they were started before and finished on those days, but they all happened [completely] on these very days. Similarly, <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; of this day was Abraham circumcised</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2365">406</xref></sup> means that many people were circumcised in one day, the verse thus stating Abraham&#x2019;s zeal in observing the commandments.</p>
<p>It further appears to me that the expression &#x201C;the <italic>etzem</italic>&#x201D; of any thing means &#x201C;its power and strength,&#x201D; the term being derived from the verses: <italic>my power &#x2018;v&#x2019;otzem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and the might</italic>) <italic>of my hand;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2366">407</xref></sup> <italic>strength &#x2018;v&#x2019;tha&#x2019;atzumoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and power</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2367">408</xref></sup> So also, <italic>One dieth &#x2018;b&#x2019;etzem tumo&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2368">409</xref></sup> means &#x201C;in <italic>the</italic> fulness of <italic>his</italic> strength.&#x201D; And since the bones form the structure of the body and its strength, they are so called [<italic>atzamoth &#x2014;</italic> from the word <italic>otzem</italic>, strength]. Thus <italic>&#x2018;k&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; the heaven for clearness</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2350">391</xref></sup> means that the purity of that which they saw [at Mount Sinai] was clear and strong, even as is a pure clear heaven. It is for this reason that He mentions about those specific days [of festivals referred to above] the expression <italic>etzem hayom</italic>, in order to indicate that these matters specified are of the very essence of the days, not because of other things added to them, namely the offerings brought on those days.</p>
<p>And so also did Onkelos translate [the word <italic>etzem</italic> as] &#x201C;<italic>bikran</italic> of that day,&#x201D; which [literally] means &#x201C; &#x2018;in the horn&#x2019; of that day,&#x201D; [i.e.,] in its essence and in its strength, the word <italic>bikran</italic> being related to these expressions: <italic>and all &#x2018;karnei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the horns</italic>) <italic>of the wicked will I cut off;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2369">410</xref></sup> <italic>my shield &#x2018;v&#x2019;keren&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and the horn of</italic>) <italic>my salvation;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2370">411</xref></sup> for since the strength [of the animal] is in its horns, therefore the substance of a thing is called <italic>karno</italic> [&#x201C;its horn&#x201D; &#x2014; its strength or essence]. In the language of the Sages we find:<sup><xref rid="fn2371">412</xref></sup> &#x201C;He pays the <italic>keren</italic> (the principal value) but he does not pay the [added] fifth.&#x201D; And some texts of Onkelos have <italic>bichran</italic> [with a <italic>chaph</italic> instead of <italic>bikran</italic> with a <italic>kuph</italic>], but it is all one, for in Scripture <italic>kova</italic> and <italic>chova</italic> both mean hat,<sup><xref rid="fn2372">413</xref></sup> and the Sages always make use of the term <italic>akava</italic> written with a <italic>kaph</italic> [meaning &#x201C;staying&#x201D;], which is derived from the expression, <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;lo y&#x2019;akveim&#x2019;</italic> [written with a <italic>kuph</italic>, and meaning: <italic>and He stayeth them not</italic>] <italic>when His voice is heard</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2373">414</xref></sup> The Rabbis also say <italic>mithkasheit</italic> [with a <italic>kuph</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn2374">415</xref></sup> from the word <italic>tachshitin</italic> [with a <italic>chaph</italic>, meaning &#x201C;ornaments&#x201D;]. They further say: &#x201C;If ants <italic>kors&#x2019;muha</italic>&#x201D; [with a <italic>kuph</italic>, meaning &#x201C;nibbled&#x201D; the crop],<sup><xref rid="fn2375">416</xref></sup> of the root: <italic>the boar out of the wood &#x2018;y&#x2019;chars&#x2019;menah&#x2019;</italic> [with a <italic>chaph</italic>, meaning: <italic>doth ravage it</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2376">417</xref></sup> And those other places where the expression <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; of this day</italic> is mentioned also mean: &#x201C;in the strength of that day,&#x201D; for they were matters which in the normal course of events could not happen in one day. Therefore Scripture stated that all the beasts and all the cattle and all the fowl and all creeping things upon the earth were gathered by &#x201C;the power&#x201D; of that day, by the decree of G-d upon them, for <italic>it was</italic> His <italic>mouth that commanded and the breath thereof it hath gathered them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2377">418</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>six hundred thousand men on foot, beside children</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2378">419</xref></sup> cannot be gathered together and go out as one man from the land of Egypt [all in one day], only by the strength of the day which was so decreed upon it by word of the Supreme One. And so also in the case of Moses our teacher, this expression [<italic>&#x2019;b&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; of this day</italic>] is intended to teach that on the day he was commanded to write this song, <italic>and teach it the children of Israel, put it in their mouths</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2379">420</xref></sup> <italic>and he finished speaking all these words</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2380">421</xref></sup> it was decreed upon him that he go up by the power of that day in which the Divine decree was given, to Mount Abarim, and then he said the section of <italic>&#x2018;V&#x2019;zoth Habrachah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>And this is the blessing</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2381">422</xref></sup> and afterwards he went up to the mountain &#x2014; all these activities being matters which would usually take many days, but they were all done by the power and strength of the day. Similarly, that three hundred and twenty men<sup><xref rid="fn2382">423</xref></sup> should be circumcised in one day in the house of Abraham was a thing that proceeded from G-d. Now the prophet Ezekiel said, <italic>they and their fathers have transgressed against Me, to &#x2018;etzem&#x2019; this day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2383">424</xref></sup> in order to include that very day in this group. So also the expression <italic>until &#x2018;etzem&#x2019; of this day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2349">390</xref></sup> of the prohibition of the new produce, means &#x201C;until and inclusive of this day&#x201D; [i.e., on the sixteenth of Nisan it is also forbidden to eat of the new produce, before the bringing of the meal-offering of the new barley], for the essence of a thing is its power and strength.</p>
<p>And our Rabbis have interpreted the expression <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;etzem&#x2019; of this day</italic> used in connection with the festivals, to mean<sup><xref rid="fn2384">425</xref></sup> &#x201C;on the day itself,&#x201D; that is to say, from the time the stars appear until they come out on the following night, thus excluding the additional time which the Sages have deduced must be added from profane unto holy [i.e., before the actual beginning of the festival, and after its actual end]. And in the cases of Noah, and the exodus from Egypt, and Moses&#x2019; [death], they interpreted that phrase to mean &#x201C;in the strength of the day,&#x201D; [that is] mid-day, as is stated in the Sifre,<sup><xref rid="fn2353">394</xref></sup> and Rashi wrote it in the section of <italic>Ha&#x2019;azinu</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2364">405</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. IT IS &#x2018;ATZERETH.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2385">426</xref></sup> &#x201C;I keep you back before Me. It is similar to the case of a prince who invited his children to a banquet for a certain number of days. When the time came for them to leave, he said, &#x2018;I beg of you stay with me for yet one more day, for your departure is so hard for me&#x0021;&#x2019; &#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And these are words of Agadah (homily) in Vayikra Rabbah.<sup><xref rid="fn2386">427</xref></sup></p>
<p>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], <italic>for in six days the Eternal made the heaven and the earth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2387">428</xref></sup> and the seventh day is the Sabbath which has no partner, and the congregation of Israel is its partner,<sup><xref rid="fn2388">429</xref></sup> as it is said, <italic>and the earth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2387">428</xref></sup> this being the eighth day. <italic>It is &#x2018;Atzereth</italic>,&#x2019; for there everything is assembled. Now with respect to the Festival of Unleavened Bread He commanded that it be observed for seven days, with the first and seventh [days] being holy, though <italic>they are all holy and the Eternal is among them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2389">430</xref></sup> From then on [i.e., beginning with the second day of Passover] we are to count forty-nine days[of the <italic>omer</italic>], which are seven weeks comparable to the [seven] &#x201C;days&#x201D; of the world,<sup><xref rid="fn2390">431</xref></sup> and then to sanctify the &#x201C;eighth day&#x201D; [i.e., the Festival of Weeks] just as the eighth day of Tabernacles [is holy]; and [the forty-nine days] counted between them are in the &#x201C;intermediate days&#x201D; of the festival, in the interval separating the first day and &#x201C;eighth day&#x201D; of the festival, this being the day of the Giving of the Torah when He made them <italic>to see His great fire</italic> and His words they heard <italic>out of the midst of the fire</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2391">432</xref></sup> Therefore our Rabbis, of blessed memory, always called the Festival of Weeks by the name of <italic>Atzereth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2392">433</xref></sup> [a name here used in the verse for the eighth day of the Festival of Tabernacles], for it is on &#x201C;the eighth&#x201D; day of the festival, which Scripture here so called by that name. And this is the [intention of the] saying of the Rabbis:<sup><xref rid="fn2393">434</xref></sup> &#x201C;The eighth day is a festival for itself&#x201D; with respect to <italic>&#x2018;p&#x2019;zar k&#x2019;shab,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2394">435</xref></sup> but yet it complements the first [seven] days<sup><xref rid="fn2395">436</xref></sup> since it is an emanation of the first days but is not like their unity. Therefore in the section of <italic>All the firstlings</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2396">437</xref></sup> He mentions in speaking of the three festivals &#x2014; the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Tabernacles &#x2014; [that the Festival of Tabernacles] is seven days<sup><xref rid="fn2397">438</xref></sup> and He did not mention the eighth day, for there He said, <italic>all thy males appear</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2398">439</xref></sup> This is thus clear.</p>
<p>39. WHEN YE HAVE GATHERED IN THE INCREASE OF THE LAND. &#x201C;[This is to state] that this seventh month [in which the Festival of Tabernacles occurs] must be at the time of the harvest. From here we learn that they were commanded to intercalate the years [with an extra month], because if there would be no such intercalation, the seventh month [i.e., Tishri] would sometimes fall in the middle of the summer, or in the winter.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And the words of the Torath Kohanim are as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn2399">440</xref></sup> &#x201C;Intercalate the years so that you make the Festival of Tabernacles at the time of the ingathering of the fruits. I might think that this refers to the ingathering of all the fruits; Scripture therefore says, <italic>Thou shalt keep the feast of Tabernacles &#x2026; after thou hast gathered in from thy threshing-floor and from thy wine-press</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2400">441</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>&#x2018;from&#x2019; thy threshing-floor</italic> but not all thy threshing-floor, <italic>and &#x2018;from&#x2019; thy wine-press</italic>, but not all thy wine-press. Now if I am to follow the expression <italic>after thou hast gathered in &#x2018;from&#x2019; thy threshing-floor</italic>, I might think that even if only a little [of it has been gathered in, the Festival of Tabernacles may already be observed in that part of the year, and there is no need then for intercalating an extra month at the end of the preceding winter]; Scripture therefore says [here], <italic>when ye have gathered in the produce of the land</italic>. How can these be reconciled? [In the following manner]: Try to intercalate the year so that the Festival of Tabernacles occurs when most of the fruits have already been gathered in.&#x201D; Now the Sages have already derived [the need for] intercalating the year from the verse <italic>Observe the month of &#x2018;aviv&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>spring</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2401">442</xref></sup> But there Scripture taught about [the intercalation of the year because of] the spring [i.e., so that the celebration of the exodus occurs in the month when there are ripe ears already, so that the sheaf of waving can be brought on the sixteenth of Nisan from the new barley], and here it teaches concerning the fruits of the trees [that most of them must be ripened at the time of the Festival of Weeks, so that they are ready to be brought as first-fruits to the Sanctuary, and that most of them are to be gathered in before the Festival of Tabernacles]. For so did the Sages teach us:<sup><xref rid="fn2402">443</xref></sup> &#x201C;The year is intercalated on account of three things: on account of ripe ears [that they be available at the time of Passover], fruits of the trees [at the time of the Festival of Weeks], and on account of the solstice [that the summer solstice should not occur after the passing of Tabernacles].<sup><xref rid="fn2403">444</xref></sup> Thus the need for intercalation is deduced automatically [from the statement] that this festival [of Tabernacles] is at the time of the ingathering [and if an extra month is not added at the end of the winter season, the festival might sometimes occur in the middle of the summer or winter].</p>
<p>The meaning, however, of the Scriptural verse here is as follows: It states, <italic>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</italic> all of <italic>which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring</italic> on all of them <italic>an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2404">445</xref></sup> However, <italic>on the fifteenth day of this seventh month</italic>, because it is the time when you have gathered in the increase of the land, <italic>ye shall keep the feast of the Eternal seven days</italic>. He said here in addition, <italic>on the first day shall be &#x2018;shabbathon&#x2019; and on the eighth day shall be &#x2018;shabbathon,&#x2019;</italic> meaning that you are to desist from work, and to rest on them, as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2405">446</xref></sup> And He further said that they should rejoice even more before G-d with the <italic>lulav</italic> and <italic>ethrog</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2406">447</xref></sup> for seven days, for it is a time of rejoicing because G-d has blessed you <italic>in all thine increase, and in all the work of thy hands, and thou shalt be altogether joyful</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2407">448</xref></sup> before Him. The meaning of the phrase [in the verse before us] <italic>ye shall keep the feast of the Eternal</italic>, is that you are to celebrate it before Him by giving thanks to His Name for your gathering of the harvest which came [in time]. Then He went back and stated again [further on in Verse 41], <italic>And ye shall keep it a feast unto the Eternal</italic>, in order to place next to it [the commandment], <italic>Ye shall dwell in booths</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2408">449</xref></sup> the meaning thereof being as follows: <italic>and ye shall keep it a feast seven days</italic> in the year by dwelling in booths, <italic>and all that are home-born shall dwell</italic> in them, thus stating that they shall make a festival of seven days by taking the <italic>lulav</italic>, and rejoicing before G-d, and dwelling in booths. And the interpretation thereof in the Torath Kohanim is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn2409">450</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And ye shall keep it a feast unto the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2410">451</xref></sup> Why is this stated? Since it is said, <italic>Seven days shalt thou keep a feast unto the Eternal thy G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2407">448</xref></sup> I might think that the Festival-offering<sup><xref rid="fn2339">380</xref></sup> must be brought on all seven days; Scripture therefore says here <italic>&#x2018;it&#x2019; &#x201D;</italic> [<italic>And ye shall keep &#x2018;it&#x2019; a feast</italic>, thus stating that this offering need only be brought once], etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2411">452</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. AND YE SHALL TAKE YOU ON THE FIRST DAY &#x2018;PRI EITZ HADAR&#x2019; (THE FRUIT OF GOODLY TREES). &#x201C;[That is, a tree] whose bark has the same taste as its fruit. <italic>Hadar</italic> [a fruit] that &#x2018;remains&#x2019; on its tree from one year to another, and this is the <italic>ethrog</italic>.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But these interpretations are merely Scriptural supports which our Rabbis taught<sup><xref rid="fn2412">453</xref></sup> as a basis for their tradition [that the reference here is to the <italic>ethrog</italic>]. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote: &#x201C;And they [i.e., the masters of tradition] have said the truth [that <italic>pri eitz hadar</italic> refers to the <italic>ethrog</italic>], for there is no fruit of the tree more beautiful (<italic>hadar</italic>) than the <italic>ethrog</italic>. The Rabbis&#x2019; interpreted that <italic>hadar</italic> means [the fruit] that &#x2018;remains&#x2019; on its tree [from one year to another], but this is merely a Scriptural support for a matter of tradition.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the tree which is called in the Aramaic language <italic>ethrog</italic>, is called in the Sacred Tongue <italic>hadar</italic>, for the meaning of the word <italic>ethrog</italic> is &#x201C;desirable,&#x201D; as [Onkelos] rendered: <italic>&#x2018;nechmad&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>pleasant</italic>) <italic>to the sight</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2413">454</xref></sup> &#x2014; &#x201C; <italic>dimrageig</italic> to see; &#x201D; <italic>&#x2018;lo thachmod&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>Thou shalt not covet</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2414">455</xref></sup> &#x2014; &#x201C;thou shalt not <italic>theirog</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2415">456</xref></sup> And we also say:<sup><xref rid="fn2416">457</xref></sup> &#x201C;from all the best, <italic>arag</italic> (most desirable) properties.&#x201D; And the terms <italic>hadar</italic> and <italic>chemdah</italic> are alike in meaning [&#x201C;desirable&#x201D;]. Thus the tree and the fruit [<italic>ethrog</italic>] are both called by one name [as <italic>hadar</italic> in Aramaic is <italic>ethrog</italic>], for such is the customary usage of names for most fruits: <italic>t&#x2019;einah</italic> [denotes both the fig tree and the fruit]; <italic>egoz</italic> (nut); <italic>rimon</italic> (pomegranate); <italic>zayith</italic> (olive) and other fruits [in all of which cases both the tree and its fruit have the same name], and similarly this tree and fruit are both called in Aramaic <italic>ethrog</italic>, and in the Sacred Tongue they are called <italic>hadar</italic>.</p>
<p>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture the verse is stating that we should take for ourselves a <italic>pri eitz hadar</italic> [&#x201C;the fruit of a tree called <italic>hadar</italic>&#x201D; in Hebrew, which is called <italic>ethrog</italic> in Aramaic], and that we take <italic>branches of palm-trees</italic>, and one <italic>bough of thick trees</italic> [known as <italic>hadas</italic>, the myrtle], and one bough of <italic>the willows of the brook</italic> [known as <italic>aravah</italic>]. Thus [we are to take] one of each of the [four] species, for the [plural] expression <italic>branches of palm-trees</italic> is connected with <italic>And ye shall take you</italic>, which refers to many people [so that each person is to take only one of these branches],<sup><xref rid="fn2417">458</xref></sup> since the final decision of the law is like Rabbi Akiba<sup><xref rid="fn2418">459</xref></sup> who says: &#x201C;Just as only one palm-branch is needed and only one <italic>ethrog</italic>, so also [we need only] one myrtle-branch and one willow-branch.&#x201D; Therefore Onkelos translated all these four species in the plural [<italic>ethrogin, lulavin</italic>, etc.], since they are all connected with the [preceding] phrase <italic>And ye shall take you</italic>, which refers to many people.<sup><xref rid="fn2417">458</xref></sup> And in [explanation of] the reason for this commandment, by way of homiletic discourse, the Rabbis have said that these [four] species are used to obtain the favor of G-d that He may give water.<sup><xref rid="fn2419">460</xref></sup></p>
<p>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], <italic>&#x2018;pri eitz hadar&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the fruit of the goodly tree</italic>) is the fruit in which there is a great deal of desire, and the first man sinned with it, as it is said, <italic>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2420">461</xref></sup> Thus the sin consisted [of taking the <italic>ethrog</italic>] alone,<sup><xref rid="fn2421">462</xref></sup> and we obtain His favor [by means of the <italic>ethrog</italic>] together with the other species &#x2026;<sup><xref rid="fn2422">463</xref></sup> From here you will understand and know that the <italic>ethrog</italic> is not bound up with the other three species, and yet it invalidates [the performance of the commandment] if it is not taken together with them, for it is comparable to <italic>Atzereth</italic> (the eighth day of Tabernacles)<sup><xref rid="fn2423">464</xref></sup> which is a festival of its own, and yet is supplementary to the first days.<sup><xref rid="fn2395">436</xref></sup> Thus they are one in potentiality but not in actuality. I have already explained the reason for this.<sup><xref rid="fn2423">464</xref></sup> Thus the meaning of the whole section is as follows: &#x201C;Ye shall keep the feast of the Great Name for the <italic>seven days</italic> of creation,<sup><xref rid="fn2424">465</xref></sup> and join on to them the eighth day, <italic>Atzereth</italic>, similar to what is said, <italic>For the leader with strong-music on the &#x2018;sheminith&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2425">466</xref></sup> [literally: &#x2018;the eighth&#x2019;]. And also on those seven days ye shall take <italic>the fruit of the tree</italic> called <italic>&#x2018;hadar&#x2019;</italic> [i.e., the <italic>ethrog</italic>] together with the palm-branch in union [with the myrtle-branch and the willow].<sup><xref rid="fn2426">467</xref></sup> That is why He mentioned first the <italic>ethrog</italic> [for it is not tied together with the palm-branch, which is in union with the other two species, since the <italic>ethrog</italic> alludes to the eighth day of the festival which is a feast of its own], but on the eighth day it is not necessary [to take these four species], for it is itself <italic>hadar</italic>. &#x201D; And this is the explanation of the verse, <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;chagothem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and ye shall keep it a feast</italic>) <italic>unto the Eternal seven days &#x2018;in the year,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2410">451</xref></sup> meaning that you are to keep it seven days &#x201C;with the year,&#x201D; that is with the surrounding and circular movement [around the altar in procession with the four species], related to the expressions: <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;chug</italic> (<italic>and the circuit</italic>) <italic>of heaven;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2427">468</xref></sup> <italic>and he marketh it out &#x2018;bam&#x2019;chugah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>with the compass</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2428">469</xref></sup> and so also: <italic>a multitude &#x2018;chogeig&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>keeping holyday</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2429">470</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our Rabbis have already alluded to this secret. Thus they have said in Vayikra Rabbah:<sup><xref rid="fn2430">471</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Pri eitz hadar</italic>, this alludes to the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, <italic>Honor &#x2018;v&#x2019;hadar&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and majesty</italic>) <italic>are before Him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2431">472</xref></sup> <italic>Branches of palm-trees</italic>, this refers to the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, <italic>The Righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2432">473</xref></sup> <italic>And boughs of thick trees</italic> [i.e., the myrtle-branch], this applies to the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, <italic>and He stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2433">474</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;V&#x2019;arvei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and willows of</italic>) <italic>the brook</italic>, this refers to the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, <italic>Extol Him that rideth &#x2018;ba&#x2019;aravoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>in the skies</italic>).&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2434">475</xref></sup></p>
<p>And in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn2435">476</xref></sup> &#x201C;What is meant by <italic>pri eitz hadar?</italic> It is as we translate it in Onkelos&#x2019; Targum: &#x2018;fruits of the tree, <italic>ethrogin</italic> and <italic>lulavin</italic>.&#x2019; And what is <italic>hadar?</italic> It is &#x2018;the majesty&#x2019; of all, which is &#x2018;the majesty&#x2019; referred to in the Song of Songs, as it is said, <italic>Who is she that looketh forth as the dawn</italic>, etc.?<sup><xref rid="fn2436">477</xref></sup> And why is it called <italic>hadar?</italic> Read not <italic>hadar</italic> (majesty), but <italic>hador</italic> (&#x2018;who resides therein&#x2019;), this being the <italic>ethrog</italic> which is separate from the group of the <italic>lulav</italic> [and myrtle-branch and willow], and yet the commandment of taking the <italic>lulav</italic> is not fulfilled without it [the <italic>ethrog</italic>]; and it is tied to all, since it is with each one, and all together they are combined as one. And what is the <italic>lulav</italic>? It is symbolic of the spinal cord. <italic>And boughs of thick trees</italic>, meaning a tree the branches of which cover its larger portion. This may be likened to a person who with his arms protects his head. Thus <italic>the bough</italic> is to the left, and <italic>the thickness</italic> to the right, and <italic>the tree</italic> in the middle.<sup><xref rid="fn2437">478</xref></sup> And why is it called <italic>eitz</italic> (tree)? Because it is the root of the tree. And what are <italic>&#x2018;arvei nachal&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>willows of the brook</italic>)? They are so called on account of the name of the place wherein they are affixed, which is <italic>nachal</italic> (brook, river), as it is written, <italic>All the rivers run into the sea</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2438">479</xref></sup> And what is &#x2018;the sea&#x2019;? I must say that it alludes to the <italic>ethrog</italic>. And how do we know that each <italic>midah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2439">480</xref></sup> of all these seven<sup><xref rid="fn2440">481</xref></sup> is called <italic>nachal?</italic> Because it is said, <italic>and from Mattanah to Nachaliel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2441">482</xref></sup> Read not <italic>Nachaliel</italic> [the name of a place], but <italic>nachalei E-il</italic> (the brooks of G-d) etc.&#x201D; Now this Midrash [referring to &#x201C;these seven&#x201D;] is in accordance with the opinion of the Sage<sup><xref rid="fn2442">483</xref></sup> who holds that we are to take three myrtle-branches, two willows, one <italic>lulav</italic>, and one <italic>ethrog</italic>, which is the final decision of the law according to the words of the Gaonim<sup><xref rid="fn2443">484</xref></sup> and all <italic>Rishonim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2444">485</xref></sup></p>
<p>42. ALL &#x2018;HA&#x2019;EZRACH&#x2019; (THAT ARE NATIVE) IN ISRAEL SHALL DWELL IN BOOTHS. &#x201C;<italic>Ezrach</italic> means native-born. <italic>Ha&#x2019;ezrach</italic> [literally: &#x2018;the&#x2019; native-born], this is to exclude women [from the obligation of dwelling in the booth, since the definite article denotes an exclusion. It was necessary that this exclusion be stated] so that you should not deduce from a similarity of expressions of <italic>the fifteenth day</italic> stated with reference to the Festival of Unleavened Bread,<sup><xref rid="fn2445">486</xref></sup> that women are obliged to dwell in a booth just as they are obliged to eat unleavened bread [on the night of Passover]. <italic>In Israel</italic>, this includes proselytes&#x201D; [that they are obliged to dwell in a booth]. This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And in the Torath Kohanim it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn2446">487</xref></sup> <italic>&#x201C;Ezrach</italic>, this is the native-born. <italic>Ha&#x2019;ezrach</italic>, this is intended to exclude women. <italic>&#x2018;All&#x2019; that are home-born</italic>, this is to include the proselytes and liberated slaves.&#x201D; And in line with the plain meaning of Scripture, by way of tradition [there is no need for a special source in Scripture here to include proselytes]. For since Scripture has stated, <italic>ye shall have one law</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2447">488</xref></sup> <italic>both for the stranger, and for him that is born in the Land</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2448">489</xref></sup> and it is further said, <italic>as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2449">490</xref></sup> there is no need to mention again in every place: &#x201C;all that are native-born and the stranger.&#x201D; Therefore He says <italic>all that are native in Israel</italic>, meaning all who are of Israel, <italic>from the greatest of them even to the least of them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2450">491</xref></sup> [to teach] that it is not sufficient that one of a household should dwell in a booth and the rest dwell in homes, but they should all dwell in booths. It is possible that the verse [uses the word <italic>ezrach</italic>] to teach that all who are <italic>like a leafy tree in its native soil</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2451">492</xref></sup> in their homes [are obliged to dwell in booths], except for those who are on a sea voyage, and those who travel on the road [who are exempt from dwelling in a booth].</p>
<p>43. THAT I MADE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TO ABIDE IN BOOTHS. &#x201C;This means the clouds of Glory&#x201D; [which surrounded the camp of the Israelites during their stay in the wilderness]. This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And in my opinion this is the correct interpretation [even] according to the literal sense of Scripture, for He commanded that the generations should know all the great deeds of the Eternal which He did wondrously with them, that He made them dwell in the clouds of His Glory like in a booth, similar to what is said, <italic>And the Eternal will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy</italic>. <italic>And there shall be a &#x2018;succah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>pavilion</italic>) <italic>for a shadow in the day-time from the heat</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2452">493</xref></sup> And since Scripture has already explained that <italic>the cloud of the Eternal was upon</italic> them <italic>by day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2453">494</xref></sup> <italic>and the pillar of fire by night</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2454">495</xref></sup> He just says here, <italic>that I made the children of Israel to abide in booths</italic>, [without explaining what kind of booths, but meaning] &#x201C;I made them booths out of the clouds of My Glory to protect them.&#x201D; Thus He commanded that at the beginning of the summer season we are to remember the exodus from Egypt by [calling] its month [the first of the months],<sup><xref rid="fn2455">496</xref></sup> and by observing its festival [of Passover], and He further commanded the remembrance of the continuous miracle which was done for them throughout the days of their stay in the wilderness, at the beginning of the winter season. And according to the opinion of the Sage who says<sup><xref rid="fn2456">497</xref></sup> that they made themselves booths in the literal sense, [we must explain that the reason why this commandment is to be observed at the onset of the winter season], is because they began to make them at the beginning of the winter, on account of the cold, as is customary in camps, and therefore He commanded [that we also make] them at that time. The sense of the remembrance is that they should know and remember that they were in the wilderness, and did not live in homes, <italic>and they found no city of habitation</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2457">498</xref></sup> for forty years, but G-d was with them and they lacked nothing.<sup><xref rid="fn2458">499</xref></sup></p>
<p>44. AND MOSES DECLARED UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THE APPOINTED SEASONS OF THE ETERNAL. The meaning thereof is as follows: The above sections contain admonitions directed to Aaron and his sons, and Moses therefore told them to Aaron and his sons, and sometimes He mentions after them also the children of Israel, as He said at the end of the section dealing with blemishes, <italic>So Moses spoke unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2459">500</xref></sup> for although Moses was only commanded, <italic>Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever be of thy seed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2460">501</xref></sup> he wanted to exhort the court of Israel about this matter [and therefore he also spoke <italic>to all the children of Israel</italic>]. Perhaps the reason [why he exhorted the court] is because a person covers up his blemishes, and the priest does not want to be disqualified on account of them from performing the Divine Service, for it is a [source of] shame and disgrace, therefore He exhorted the court about this matter. But here Scripture states that he declared the appointed seasons of the Eternal to all the children of Israel as one man, and it did not single out the sons of Aaron in these commandments, the reason being that the admonition applies to all alike, since the main [commandments] of these sections are that we are to rest on the Sabbaths and festivals, and to proclaim them holy convocations. None of the offerings are mentioned in these sections, except for the offering of the sheaf [on the second day of Passover], and the two loaves [on the Festival of Weeks], as they [these festivals] are the causes for their being offered. And in the section where the main offerings of the Day of Atonement are set forth,<sup><xref rid="fn2461">502</xref></sup> it says, <italic>Speak unto Aaron thy brother</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2462">503</xref></sup> [because it was Aaron&#x2019;s duty to perform the Service on that day].</p>
<p>And our Rabbis have interpreted [the verse before us] as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn2463">504</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Eternal</italic>. This teaches that Moses told Israel the laws of Passover on the Passover, and the laws of <italic>Atzereth</italic> [the Festival of Weeks]<sup><xref rid="fn2464">505</xref></sup> on <italic>Atzereth</italic>, and the laws of the Festival of Tabernacles on Tabernacles. In the very language that he heard it, in that language he told them all the sections.&#x201D; Onkelos also intended to imply this point, for he rendered the verse as follows: &#x201C;And Moses declared the order<sup><xref rid="fn2465">506</xref></sup> of the appointed seasons of the Eternal, and taught them to the children of Israel.&#x201D; It appears [from Onkelos&#x2019; additional phrase &#x201C;the order of &#x201D;] that his opinion is to allude [to the fact] that Moses taught the children of Israel the order of the festivals by means of the intercalation [of the years with an extra month], which was handed over to him by word of mouth on Sinai, this being alluded to in the Scriptural text, <italic>which ye shall proclaim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2466">507</xref></sup> holy convocations, and Moses taught the children of Israel by word of mouth the whole traditional order of the secret of intercalation.</p>
<h1>24</h1>
<p>2. COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. &#x201C;This is the section containing the [actual] commandment of lighting the lamps. And the section of <italic>V&#x2019;atah Tetzaveh</italic> (<italic>And thou shalt command</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2467">508</xref></sup> [where the same subject is mentioned], is stated only for the sake of giving an orderly account of the work of the Tabernacle, explaining what the purpose of the candelabrum is, and the sense of the verse there is as follows: &#x2018;<italic>and thou wilt</italic> at some future time <italic>command the children of Israel</italic> on this matter.&#x2019; &#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>But it does not appear to me to be correct, for that section [there in Exodus 27:20] is not in fact adjoined to the section of the candelabrum [which is mentioned previously in Exodus 25:31-40]; and [also] it has already been stated, <italic>And he lighted the lamps before the Eternal, as the Eternal commanded Moses</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2468">509</xref></sup> thus both the commandment and fulfillment were already mentioned and kept&#x0021; Rather, the need for [restatement of] this section is for two purposes. For there He commanded that <italic>they bring you</italic> a donation <italic>on the behalf of the children of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2469">510</xref></sup> that is to say, from every man with whom was found <italic>pure olive oil</italic> [<italic>beaten</italic>] <italic>for the light</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2467">508</xref></sup> together with the other donations for the Tabernacle. And so they did, as it is said, <italic>And the princes brought</italic> etc. <italic>and the spice, and the oil, for the light</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2470">511</xref></sup> And although it says there, <italic>it shall be a statute forever throughout their generations</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2469">510</xref></sup> this refers to the lighting of the lamps. But now the oil which the princes brought as a donation was used up, and therefore He commanded that the children of Israel take from the public treasury throughout the generations<sup><xref rid="fn2471">512</xref></sup> <italic>pure olive oil beaten for the light</italic>, as was the first oil [of the princes]. This is similar to the expression, <italic>that they bring thee a Red Heifer</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2472">513</xref></sup> meaning that they should seek it and it is to be brought from the public treasury. Also, there [in the section of <italic>V&#x2019;atah Tetzaveh</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn2467">508</xref></sup> He stated only, <italic>Aaron and his sons shall set it in order</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn2469">510</xref></sup> which might mean [set it in order] on the candelabrum, or without the candelabrum if it is broken or lost, as happened when they returned from the [Babylonian] exile.<sup><xref rid="fn2473">514</xref></sup> Therefore now He stated clearly, <italic>He shall order the lamps upon the pure candelabrum</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2474">515</xref></sup> teaching that they should only light the lamps upon the pure candelabrum. And the interpretation of our Rabbis is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn2475">516</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Upon the pure candelabrum</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2474">515</xref></sup> This means upon the very candelabrum itself, that he is not to support them [i.e., the lamps] with pieces of wood or pebbles [but the lamps are to be upon the candelabrum itself, with nothing intervening between them]. <italic>He shall set the lamps before the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2474">515</xref></sup> This teaches that he is not to set them outside the Sanctuary and bring them inside. <italic>Continually</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2474">515</xref></sup> even on the Sabbath; <italic>continually</italic>, even in impurity.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2476">517</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. &#x2018;V&#x2019;HAYTHAH&#x2019; (AND IT SHALL BE) FOR AARON AND HIS SONS &#x2014; &#x201C;[The feminine word <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;haythah&#x2019;</italic> refers to] the meal-offering,<sup><xref rid="fn2477">518</xref></sup> for anything which is offered of grain is included within the term <italic>minchah</italic> (meal-offering). [The masculine suffix in] <italic>&#x2018;va&#x2019;achaluhu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and they shall eat it</italic>), refers to the <italic>lechem</italic>&#x201D; [&#x201C;bread&#x201D; mentioned in Verse 7, which is a masculine noun]. This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. It is possible that the verb <italic>v&#x2019;haythah</italic> [&#x201C;and it shall be&#x201D; &#x2014; in the feminine] refers to each of the two <italic>ma&#x2019;arachoth</italic> [&#x201C;rows&#x201D; of six loaves mentioned in Verse 6, since <italic>ma&#x2019;arachah</italic> is in the feminine, and hence <italic>v&#x2019;haythah</italic> is also in the feminine]. And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabalah], <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;haythah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and it shall be</italic>) <italic>for Aaron and his sons</italic> refers back to <italic>brith olam</italic> [&#x201C;an everlasting covenant&#x201D; at the end of the preceding Verse 8, since the word <italic>brith</italic> is in the feminine], similar to what is said, <italic>&#x2018;Brithi haythah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>My covenant was</italic>) <italic>with him of life and peace</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2478">519</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND THE SON OF AN ISRAELITE WOMAN, WHOSE FATHER WAS AN EGYPTIAN, WENT OUT, etc. This means that he went out <italic>among the children of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2479">520</xref></sup> similar to the expression: <italic>and he went out into the midst of the city</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2480">521</xref></sup> meaning that he [Mordecai] went out from his house or from where he was abiding into the city. Similarly, this [son of an Israelite woman] went out from his tent or from his place, and came into the midst of the people, and they strove there. The meaning of the word <italic>bamachaneh</italic> [&#x201C;in the camp&#x201D; &#x2014; <italic>and the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together &#x2018;in the camp&#x2019;</italic>], is that the quarrel took place in the camp and many people heard it, and [when they heard the son of the Israelite woman blaspheming the Name], they took hold of him <italic>and they brought him unto Moses</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2481">522</xref></sup> into [his] tent. And the reason why Scripture mentions this episode here, is as the words of the Sage<sup><xref rid="fn2482">523</xref></sup> who says: &#x201C;He &#x2018;came forth&#x2019; from the section above [i.e., he began his argument by speaking contemptuously of a law mentioned in the above section], for he sinned with his lips concerning <italic>the fire-offerings of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2483">524</xref></sup> and an Israelite man rebuked him, whereupon they strove and he became angered and then blasphemed &#x201C;himself.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2484">525</xref></sup></p>
<p>The intention of the expression <italic>the son of an Israelite woman and a man of Israel</italic>, is to teach that if a non-Jew has sexual relations with a Jewish woman, the child is not deemed Jewish. And although we have rendered the final decision in the Gemara<sup><xref rid="fn2485">526</xref></sup> that if a non-Jew has sexual relations with a Jewish woman whether she is single or married, the child is a fully-qualified Jew, yet they have said,<sup><xref rid="fn2486">527</xref></sup> &#x201C;the child is &#x2018;rejected,&#x2019; &#x201D; meaning that it is disqualified for the priesthood;<sup><xref rid="fn2487">528</xref></sup> and certainly it is not considered a fully-qualified Israelite by name as far as genealogy is concerned, with respect to the standards [i.e., as to where he was to take his place under one of the four main standards that were set up],<sup><xref rid="fn2488">529</xref></sup> and inheriting of the Land, for it is written of them, <italic>according to the names of the tribes of their fathers</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2489">530</xref></sup> And that which the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn2490">531</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Among the children of Israel</italic>, this teaches that he had become a proselyte,&#x201D; does not mean that he needed conversion, for he was like all Israelites who entered into the covenant by circumcision, immersion, and the expiation by blood, at the time of the Giving of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2491">532</xref></sup> But the intention of the Rabbis [in this text of the Torath Kohanim] was to state that he was reared by his mother and became attached to Israel, this being the meaning of the expression <italic>among the children of Israel</italic>, that he was with them and he did not want to go after his father to be an Egyptian. Similarly, that which the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn2490">531</xref></sup> &#x201C;Although there were no <italic>mamzerim</italic> at that time, he was like one,&#x201D; this text follows the opinion of a single Sage [who says that if a non-Jew has sexual relations with a Jewish woman, the child is deemed a <italic>mamzer</italic>], but the final decision of the law is that the child is a fully-qualified Jew.</p>
<p>And the French Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn2492">533</xref></sup> say that the reason why this son of the Israelite woman required conversion [according to the Torath Kohanim mentioned above], was because he lived before the Giving of the Torah, and his status was determined by that of the male parent, as is to be deduced from what the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2493">534</xref></sup> &#x201C;Where [the parents of a child are of] non-Jewish nations, we go [as far as the status of the child is concerned] by that of the father.&#x201D; And when this [son of the Israelite woman whose father was an Egyptian] was born, they did not circumcise him, for his status was that of an Egyptian, but when he grew up he voluntarily converted and was circumcised.<sup><xref rid="fn2494">535</xref></sup> But such is not my opinion, for since the time that Abraham entered into the covenant [with G-d], they [i.e., his descendants through Isaac and Jacob] were Israelites <italic>and were not to be reckoned among the nations</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2495">536</xref></sup> just as the Rabbis have said with respect to Esau:<sup><xref rid="fn2496">537</xref></sup> &#x201C;Perhaps the case of an Israelite who is an apostate is different&#x0021;&#x201D; [Thus the Rabbis referred to Esau, who was long before the Giving of the Torah on Sinai, as an &#x201C;Israelite.&#x201D;] And is it not an argument from minor to major&#x0021; &#x201C;If after the Giving of the Torah when a Cuthean has sexual relations with a daughter of Abraham, and he is forbidden to her by a negative commandment and his betrothal to her is not valid, yet she is the source of purification of the nations, so that her child becomes fully-qualified and of her own standing &#x2014; does it not follow all the more so that before the Torah was given, she purifies her child to be of her own standing, so that circumcision be incumbent upon him as upon the seed of Abraham, and that he be part of the community of the children of Israel&#x0021;&#x201D;</p>
<p>18. AND HE THAT SMITETH A BEAST MORTALLY SHALL PAY FOR IT; &#x2018;NEFESH&#x2019; (LIFE) FOR &#x2018;NEFESH&#x2019; (LIFE). This does not mean a real animal, that he must buy him an animal similar to his one [that was killed], but rather it means that he is to give him monetary compensation equal to the damage he caused him. Similarly, <italic>breach for breach, eye for eye</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2497">538</xref></sup> [also means monetary compensation], according to the opinion of our Rabbis.<sup><xref rid="fn2498">539</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID AS THE ETERNAL COMMANDED MOSES. &#x201C;This includes the leaning of hands,<sup><xref rid="fn2499">540</xref></sup> casting from a height, and hanging the dead body, as well as the regulation, <italic>his body shall not remain all night upon the tree</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2500">541</xref></sup> [This is the language of the] Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn2501">542</xref></sup> And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that the plain meaning thereof is that from that day onwards they acted in accordance with the law concerning one who wounds [a fellowman or causes him damage, mentioned here above in Verses 17-21]. But it is not a correct [explanation] that this verse be referring to the future. The plain meaning thereof is as follows: &#x201C;<italic>and they stoned him with stones</italic> because <italic>the children of Israel did</italic> according to the commandment which <italic>the Eternal commanded Moses</italic>.&#x201D; Such a repetition of expressions is found with respect to all those who keep the commandments of G-d, just as it is said in the section of the Passover,<sup><xref rid="fn2502">543</xref></sup> and as He stated in the section of the census, <italic>Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that the Eternal commanded Moses, so did they;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2503">544</xref></sup> and so also with regards to the rods of the princes: <italic>Thus did Moses; as the Eternal commanded him, so did he</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2504">545</xref></sup></p>
<p>The correct interpretation here appears to me to be that since Scripture mentioned first the stoning, it went back afterwards and stated, <italic>and the children of Israel did</italic> etc., for the meaning of Scripture is to declare that when <italic>Moses spoke to the children of Israel they</italic> immediately <italic>brought forth him that had cursed</italic>, and they stoned him; and all the children of Israel did so in order to keep and fulfill [the commandment] <italic>as the Eternal commanded Moses</italic>, but not out of hatred to the son of the Egyptian who had striven with the Israelite, for [they did it] in order to remove the unworthy one from their midst.</p>

<ftnote id="fn1988">(29) To understand Ramban&#x2019;s criticism of Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation, it is necessary to recall the difference between a statement which is a mere negation and one which is a prohibition. &#x201C;An admonition is in the nature of a charge; it is in fact the verb in its command-form&#x201D; (&#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. II, p. 391). But a statement of negation merely excludes a particular case from a certain subject (see further, Ramban Vol. II, p. 350, Note 71). Now the verse before us reads, <italic>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane the Sanctuary of his G-d</italic>. In interpreting the phrase, <italic>neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary</italic> as a prohibition, meaning that <italic>he is not permitted</italic> to leave the Sanctuary to follow the bier, how could Rashi continue on the basis of <italic>the same phrase</italic> to state that <italic>he need not</italic> leave the Sanctuary, but he may perform the Service, since these two interpretations of the same phrase are contradictory to each other&#x0021; This is the meaning of Ramban&#x2019;s succinct objection: &#x201C;Since the verse <italic>permitted</italic> the High Priest &#x2026; then there is <italic>no admonition</italic> &#x2026;&#x201D; Mizrachi, in defense of Rashi, answers that Rashi was not referring only to the first phrase [as if both the permission and the admonition are derived from the same phrase], but rather to both phrases of the verse, the first one [<italic>neither shall he go out</italic> &#x2026; ] establishing the prohibition, and the second one [<italic>nor profane</italic> &#x2026; ] constituting the negation. Ramban will also further on defend Rashi&#x2019;s position from another standpoint.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1989">(30) &#x201C;Masters of the <italic>Halachoth</italic>.&#x201D; From the ensuing phrase [&#x201C;counted it among the negative commandments in the Hilchoth Gedoloth&#x201D;], it is obvious that Ramban is referring to one particular work. But if so, why does he speak of &#x201C;the masters&#x201D; [in the plural] of that work? It may be that this is because it has long been in doubt whether the authorship of that book is to be ascribed to Rav Yehudai Gaon or to Rabbi Shimon Kairo, or to both. Hence Ramban writes here &#x201C;the masters of the <italic>Halachoth</italic>.&#x201D; See, however, in Exodus 21:7, where Ramban writes of &#x201C;the master of the Hilchoth Gedoloth&#x201D; &#x2014; in the singular. See Vol. II, p. 350, Note 70.</ftnote>

When Moses was angry with Elazar and Ithamar, Aaron&#x2019;s two remaining sons, for not eating a certain offering as required, but burning it instead, Aaron intervened by replying: &#x201C;Did <italic>they</italic> perform the rites of the offerings? It was <italic>I</italic>, the High Priest, who ministered, and the High Priest may indeed minister whilst an <italic>onen</italic>. And as for the reason why that offering was burnt etc.&#x201D; (see above, 10:19).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1998">(39) The significance of this phrase of Ramban (&#x201C;the interpretation of the text&#x201D;), becomes clearer later on in the text, as another interpretation is offered by the author. At this point here Ramban is saying that the plain interpretation of the Beraitha shows that the First Sage agrees with Rashi&#x2019;s view that the verse before us is a mere negation, and not an admonition to the High Priest (see following note).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1999">(40) Ramban&#x2019;s meaning is as follows: Since the First Sage of this Beraitha derives the <italic>admonition</italic> against a <italic>common</italic> priest ministering whilst in mourning from the verse about the High Priest [as explained in the text], this perforce shows that this Sage holds that with reference to the High Priest, the verse is a mere negation, and the reasoning is as follows: &#x201C;Since Scripture states that the High Priest <italic>need not</italic> leave his ministration, we understand by implication that the common priest <italic>must</italic> leave it.&#x201D; Thus with reference to the High Priest the verse is a mere negation, but, by implication, it is an admonition to the common priest. Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation quoted at the beginning of this verse, that the verse is a negation, is thus justified and is in accord with the opinion of this Beraitha. &#x2014; Thus far Ramban argued on the basis of the <italic>interpretation</italic> of the text of the Beraitha, that it substantiates <italic>Rashi&#x2019;s</italic> position. Ramban will now turn his attention to the fact that a cursory reading of the Beraitha does convey the thought that the verse is <italic>an admonition</italic> to the High Priest, which is the opinion of the Hilchoth Gedoloth [as mentioned above], and he will explain the Beraitha accordingly. Thus Ramban has &#x201C;validated the words of <italic>all</italic> the Sages&#x201D; &#x2014; Rashi and Hilchoth Gedoloth as he promised above in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2000">(41) &#x201C;They.&#x201D; The reference may be to &#x201C;the masters of the <italic>Halachoth</italic>&#x201D; (see Note 30 above).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2002">(43) Sanhedrin 18 a. &#x2014; Ramban now quotes a text showing that the verse <italic>&#x2018;Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary,&#x2019; prohibits</italic> the High Priest from following the bier of his near relative, so that he should not become defiled thereby and thus &#x201C;go out from his sanctity&#x201D; (see Note 44 further). From this text it would then appear that the verse is <italic>not</italic> an admonition against his going out of the Sanctuary because of the honor of the <italic>Service</italic>, but because of the honor of his own sanctity, which would thus be a contradiction to what was said above. This, in short, is the intention of Ramban in quoting this text, and further on he will remove the difficulty.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2003">(44) That is to say, he is to guard himself against being defiled by the dead. This implies that he <italic>is</italic> to follow the bier, but must guard himself against touching it or its bearers, and hence he must never be in sight of the funeral cortege.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2009">(50) The intention of Ramban&#x2019;s comment is that this verse is primarily intended to teach that the High Priest is <italic>not</italic> to marry a woman who is not a virgin. And the reason why it is stated in a positive form, is to make the negative aspect of it carry the force of a positive commandment, because it is an accepted principle that a negative commandment which is derived from a positive commandment carries only the force of a positive commandment. Therefore if he marries a woman who is not a virgin, he does not incur whipping, since the prohibition thereof is derived from a positive commandment, and only carries the force of a positive commandment, for the violation of which the court is not empowered to mete out punishment. This interpretation is made necessary by the following Verse 14, where it is stated again, <italic>but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife</italic>. As Ramban will explain further on, it is this expression in Verse 14 which established the <italic>positive</italic> aspect thereof, while Verse 13 before us expresses the prohibitive part thereof. Thus the two verses are not redundant, but instead complement each other.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2031">(72) Ramban&#x2019;s objection to Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation is thus clear. Rashi stated that <italic>charum</italic> is one whose nose is so far sunk that he is able to paint both his eyes with one stroke. But, as pointed out by Ramban, this is only the opinion of a single Sage, Aba Yosei, while all the other Sages differ with him, as explained in the text. Mizrachi too, writes that he does not know what prompted Rashi to follow the opinion of a single Sage. See also Gur Aryeh.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2038">(79) Ramban now sets forth the thought that the blemishes mentioned in these verses are primary types of blemishes, which are to serve as examples for other defects to be deduced therefrom. Thus the Torah mentioned first, cases of missing limbs, then uneven limbs etc. Thus the list here, although not exhaustive, served as the source for the deduction of other defects enumerated by the Rabbis of the Talmud.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2039">(80) Bechoroth, Chapter 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2040">(81) There are three phrases here in the order they are written in the verse: 1. <italic>that they separate themselves, from the holy things of the children of Israel</italic>. 2. <italic>and that they profane not My holy Name</italic>. 3. <italic>which they hallow unto Me</italic>. Now since the sense of the verse is that when the priests are in a state of impurity, they are to separate themselves from the holy things which <italic>the Israelites have hallowed</italic> to G-d&#x2019;s Name, such as the offerings and the heave-offering, etc., then phrase 3 should follow phrase 1, since the word &#x201C;they&#x201D; (in phrase 3) refers back to &#x201C;the children of Israel&#x201D; at the end of phrase 1. In other words, since the word &#x201C;they&#x201D; in phrase 3 means &#x201C;the children of Israel&#x201D; mentioned in phrase 1, and the word &#x201C;they&#x201D; in phrase 2 definitely means &#x201C;the priests,&#x201D; why did Scripture place phrase 2 between phrases 1 and 3, which both refer to the children of Israel? Therefore Rashi, by way of interpretation, transposed the phrases to be read in this order: 1, 3, 2. This transposed order is followed in the J.P.S. translation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2041">(82) Ramban&#x2019;s point is as follows: As long as we interpreted the verse as referring only to the holy things which <italic>the children of Israel</italic> have hallowed, it was necessary to transpose the phrases, as explained above. But if, as Rashi now suggests, the verse speaks of <italic>two</italic> kinds of hallowed things &#x2014; those hallowed by Israelites and those made holy by the priests &#x2014; then the word &#x201C;they&#x201D; in phrase 3 (see Note 81) no longer refers back to &#x201C;the children of Israel&#x201D; in phrase 1, and there is no need to transpose the order of the phrases&#x0021; Hence the last sentence in Rashi contradicts his previous explanation&#x0021;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2047">(88) Abusaula.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2048">(89) Exodus 25:2. Ramban&#x2019;s explanation is found there in Verse 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2049">(90) With this interpretation Ramban avoids the difficulty as to why the Torah singled out here the priests in mentioning the prohibition of <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic> and <italic>treifah</italic>, since the law applies to all Israelites (See Exodus 22:30 on <italic>treifah</italic>, and Deuteronomy 14:21 on <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic>). Ramban&#x2019;s explanation is that since the main theme of this section is to warn the priests to separate themselves from holy things when they are in a state of impurity, therefore the Torah mentions here the admonition against their eating <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic> and <italic>treifah</italic>, since by so doing they will not only have transgressed a law which applies to all Israel, but they will also have to separate themselves from the Sanctuary and its holy things, as they will have been rendered impure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2050">(91) Verse 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2051">(92) Verse 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2052">(93) This is not expressly mentioned in this section here. But the Rabbis interpreted: &#x201C;<italic>Or a man</italic> (Verse 5), this refers to the dead.&#x201D; (Torath Kohanim, <italic>Emor</italic> 4:4).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2053">(94) Verse 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2054">(95) Therefore even after the animal torn by beasts has died, when strictly speaking it may be referred to as <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic> since it was not ritually slaughtered, the Torah still calls it here <italic>treifah</italic>, for from the moment when it is torn by the beast it is called <italic>treifah</italic>, whether it is alive or after its death.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2055">(96) An animal that may <italic>not</italic> be eaten, even if ritually slaughtered, conveys impurity to the one who eats of it [in addition of course to having violated the prohibition against eating it], because there is no law of ritual slaughter regarding it, and it is therefore included under the term <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic>. An animal of the permitted species, which, when ritually slaughtered, is found to have an organic disease which renders it forbidden for eating, does not convey impurity to the person who eats it, although he has transgressed the law which prohibits the eating of <italic>treifah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2056">(97) Above, 9:1. &#x2014; <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 11:24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2057">(98) Chullin 100 b, and mentioned here in Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2058">(99) But a bird of a forbidden species has no defiling effect if eaten unintentionally (Mishneh Torah, <italic>Hilchoth Aboth Hatumoth</italic> 3:14). If there is, however, an intention to eat it, and it has been rendered susceptible to impurity [by having come into contact with liquid], it is like any other food and may itself contract a first grade impurity, but only if it itself comes into contact with an object that conveys impurity. It is not, however, capable of rendering the eater impure, as <italic>human beings</italic> cannot become impure through contact with <italic>food</italic>. The case of the carrion of a bird of a permitted species is a special exception, because in that case the Torah declared that it conveys impurity automatically <italic>if eaten</italic> [but not if merely touched], although it itself has not received impurity from another object. In short, it is, if eaten, a primary source of impurity which renders the eater impure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2059">(100) In other words, since as explained, the verse before us has reference only to the <italic>carrion</italic> of a permitted species of bird, which is <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic>, why then did Scripture here mention <italic>treifah</italic> altogether? The answer is: it was necessary for Scripture to state here also <italic>u&#x2019;treifah</italic> etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2060">(101) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Emor</italic> 4:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2061">(102) Above, Verse 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2062">(103) Here referring to <italic>terumah</italic> (the heave-offering) which is given to the priest from the produce of the Land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2063">(104) In other words, since Scripture states, <italic>then he shall add its fifth part &#x2018;to it</italic>,&#x2019; it implies already that it is in addition to the original value of the heave-offering he ate which he must return to the priest. There is therefore no need any longer to interpret <italic>and he shall give unto the priest &#x2018;eth&#x2019; the holy thing</italic> as meaning&#x201C;with&#x201D; the holy thing, since this has already been mentioned above in the preceding verse, and instead we interpret the word <italic>eth</italic> in its normal way, namely, the mark of the accusative case. By the same token of reasoning, the second interpretation mentioned in the text [that the word <italic>v&#x2019;nathan</italic> draws along with it a similar word] also becomes unnecessary, since the word <italic>alav</italic> (to it) clearly indicates that he is to give both the original value and the added fifth to the priest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2064">(105) For since the preceding verse [14] speaks of a non-priest eating the heave-offering, it is logical to interpret Verse 16 before us as being an admonition to the priests against giving the heave-offering to be eaten by non-priests [as Rashi first interpreted the verse]. According to Onkelos&#x2019; interpretation, however, that it is an admonition to the priests that they themselves should not eat it when in a state of impurity, then it properly belongs in the section above. For this reason Rashi rejected Onkelos&#x2019; interpretation as &#x201C;unnecessary,&#x201D; meaning to say, that while it is of course true that the priests are not permitted to do so, it is unnecessary to derive this prohibition from our verse, as it may be derived by logical deduction from Verse 6 above, which states concerning a priest who has become defiled, <italic>he shall not eat of the holy things</italic> (Verse 4; Makkoth 14 b).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2065">(106) See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. II, pp. 277-278.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2066">(107) The first admonition is in Verse 10 here: <italic>There shall no common man eat of the holy thing</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2067">(108) <italic>Tevel</italic> is produce from which the heave-offering and the tithes have not been separated.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2070">(111) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Emor</italic> 6:8-10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2071">(112) In Tractate Niddah 32a this is explained as follows: &#x201C;This includes a case where a non-priest anoints himself with the oil of heave-offering, so that he is as liable as if he had drunk it; but for drinking itself we need no verse to include it in the prohibition, since drinking is always included under the term of &#x2018;eating.&#x2019; &#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2072">(113) In our Torath Kohanim, <italic>Emor</italic> 6:8-10, the reading is as follows: &#x201C;For the holy things of the children of Israel, [a non-priest who eats of them by mistake] is liable to add a fifth [to the original value], but for the holy things of non-Jews, he is not obliged to pay the added fifth.&#x201D; The original value he must of course repay, since they were not his.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2073">(114) The discrepancies between the Gemara and the Torath Kohanim are as follows: (a) The Gemara interprets the verse, <italic>And they shall not profane</italic> etc. as referring to that which is yet to be offered [as explained above in the text], and the Torath Kohanim explained it to include anointing oneself with or drinking oil of heave-offering. (b) In the Gemara the Rabbis derived from the Scriptural use of the word <italic>yarimu</italic> (they shall set apart) in the future, that this establishes the prohibition against eating <italic>tevel</italic> [as explained in the text], while the Torath Kohanim interpreted it to teach that for the heave-offering in the <italic>tevel</italic> he does not pay a fifth, if he ate it in error.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2074">(115) Yerushalmi, Maaser Sheini II, 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2075">(116) Verse 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2076">(117) One might have thought that since <italic>tevel</italic> contains the heave-offering which will be set apart for the priest, a non-priest who eats it by mistake should therefore make restitution to the priest by giving him its value and an added fifth, just as if he had eaten separately heave-offering which has already been removed from the produce. To preclude us from such reasoning, Scripture states here that he does not have to pay the additional fifth. However, the Divine punishment for eating <italic>tevel</italic> is the same as for eating the heave-offering, as Ramban continues.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2077">(118) The difference between these two kinds of obligations will be clarified further on in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2078">(119) Not mentioned in our Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2079">(120) The word <italic>l&#x2019;phalei</italic> contains also the letters of the word <italic>pele</italic> (wonder), and accordingly Ramban interprets the verse in this light. See Note 125.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2080">(121) Verse 21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2081">(122) Numbers 15:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2082">(123) Further, 27:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2083">(124) Numbers 6:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2084">(125) It is for this reason that Scripture uses in all these cases an expression of <italic>l&#x2019;phalei</italic> or <italic>yaphli</italic>, for since the root is <italic>pele</italic> (wonder, surpassing, or extraordinary) it suggests that the vow-offering is generally made when a person is in distress, and vows that if G-d will do wondrously with him he will bring an offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2085">(126) Genesis 28:20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2086">(127) Numbers 21:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2087">(128) Jonah 1:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2088">(129) In other words, the text now quoted apparently does not hold the opinion that a vow-offering is made only in time of distress, and a freewill-offering when one is in good circumstances. Rather, the difference between them is etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2089">(130) Exodus 35:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2090">(131) Rashi thus understood the word <italic>nedavah</italic> here not as a freewill-offering for the altar [as we have understood the word till now], but as a freewill <italic>gift</italic> for the Temple repair. Ramban will further on afford a satisfactory explanation for this interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2091">(132) I.e., they can be sold for common food and the money used for the repair of the Temple.</ftnote>

But not so <italic>ta&#x2019;aseh</italic> (thou shalt &#x201C;make&#x201D;), as Ramban continues to explain. Hence since it states here: &#x201C;a freewill-offering <italic>ta&#x2019;aseh otho</italic>,&#x201D; the reference is not to making it an offering, but that we may make a gift of a blemished animal to the Temple treasury for necessary repairs. Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation [&#x201C;<italic>that mayest thou make for a freewill-offering</italic> &#x2014; for keeping the Temple in repair&#x201D;], is thus well-founded in the language of the verse.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2108">(149) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Emor</italic> 7:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2109">(150) Such as an animal that is too young for an offering (so explained by Malbim <italic>ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2110">(151) Why is this expression [<italic>any of the herd or flock</italic>] mentioned here at all, when it would have sufficed to state &#x201C;and one that has a limb too large etc.&#x201D;? The Torath Kohanim answers that it forms a sort of &#x201C;similar expression&#x201D; with Verse 28 further on, stating: <italic>And whether it be one of the herd or flock, ye shall not slaughter it and its young both in one day</italic>, this being a case of &#x201C;lacking time,&#x201D; and the verse before us thus establishes the principle that <italic>anything</italic> disqualified for offering in the herd or flock, must not be brought as an offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2111">(152) &#x201C;For since it states, <italic>that mayest thou make for a freewill gift</italic> [for Temple repairs], it teaches that only a blemished animal we may so dedicate, but not an unblemished animal, and a negative commandment derived from a positive commandment carries the force of the positive commandment&#x201D; (Temurah 7b).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2112">(153) Literally: &#x201C;him and his young&#x201D; &#x2014; in the masculine. Since the law, as will be explained, applies only to the mother and the young, the question appears why Scripture uses here the masculine. Ramban will further on explain it.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2148">(189) This is because His intention in mentioning the Sabbath was not to explain all its commandments and laws, but only to exclude etc. (as explained in the text).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2151">(192) The Hebrew word is <italic>kabalah</italic>, and is here understood as referring to a Scriptural passage outside the Five Books of Moses. This usage of the word is found already in a Mishnah in Taanith 15 a.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2159">(200) I.e., the mid-festival days, or the half-festive days between the first and the last days of Passover or of Succoth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2160">(201) Scripture therefore states with reference to the first and last days of Passover and of Succoth, that it is on them that servile work is forbidden, but not on the intermediate days of the festival.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2161">(202) I.e. an argument from minor to major. &#x201C;If work that will not permit delay is forbidden, then surely it is all the more so forbidden if the work can be delayed till after the festival.&#x201D; See in Vol. II, p. 133, Note 208, on <italic>kal vachomer</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2171">(212) In other words, when the Torah states concerning any festival, &#x201C;no manner of &#x2018;servile work&#x2019; shall be done on it,&#x201D; that establishes already the permission to prepare necessary food, since such work is not <italic>&#x2018;m&#x2019;lecheth avodah&#x2019;</italic> (servile work). But where Scripture states concerning a festival, &#x201C;no manner &#x2018;of work&#x2019; shall be done on it&#x201D; [an expression which is similar to that stated concerning the Sabbath], then it is always followed with a permission for the preparing of necessary food, since the term &#x201C;work&#x201D; is inclusive of all labors.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2174">(215) In Exodus 12:16 &#x2014; quoted above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2175">(216) Further, Verse 28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2176">(217) See above in <italic>Seder Kedoshim</italic> Note 286. It is important to note that in the printed editions of Ramban the text here is &#x201C;Rabbi Abraham&#x201D; (ibn Ezra) instead of &#x201C;Rabbi [or Rabbeinu] Chananel,&#x201D; as found in Ramban manuscripts. It is, however, not found at all in Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s commentaries, thus proving that the correct reading is &#x201C;Rabbeinu Chananel.&#x201D; Ramban&#x2019;s interpretation of the term <italic>m&#x2019;lecheth avodah</italic>, as substantiated by Rabbeinu Chananel, has had a wide influence on the whole concept of &#x201C;work&#x201D; on the festivals (see an article of mine in &#x201C;Hadarom,&#x201D; No. 34, pp. 234-237).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2177">(218) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Emor</italic> 12:5-8. See also in Vol. II, p. 106, Note 45 on Rabbeinu Chananel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2178">(219) Verse 36. See my Hebrew commentary p. 145, that this is the correct reading here. It is this verse which is clearly referred to by Ramban when he begins the interpretation of the Beraitha.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2179">(220) Further, Verse 36. See my Hebrew commentary p. 145.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2180">(221) Further, Verse 37.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2181">(222) Verses 36 and 37 are thus combined to yield this thought.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2182">(223) Shabbath 32 b. In the case before us, Verse 37 [<italic>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</italic>] is explained by an antecedent phrase in Verse 36 [<italic>Ye shall do no manner of servile work</italic>]. Ramban in speaking of &#x201C;a penultimate phrase&#x201D; is merely completing the quotation of the Talmudic saying, but the intent here is perforce to &#x201C;an antecedent phrase.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2183">(224) &#x201C;<italic>Ye shall do no manner of servile work</italic>. I might think that it is forbidden to do servile work also on the intermediate days of the festival. Scripture therefore states <italic>it</italic> (the eighth day of Tabernacles) <italic>is a day of solemn assembly</italic> [but not the intermediate days]&#x201D; (Rashi, Verse 36).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2184">(225) Chagigah 18 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2185">(226) Verse 8, referring to the seventh day of Passover, which is a full festival day as is the eighth day of Tabernacles.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2186">(227) As it is stated in Deuteronomy 16:8 with reference to the Passover: <italic>and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly &#x2026; thou shalt do no work therein</italic>. Since it does not state &#x201C;servile work,&#x201D; the restriction would seem to apply to &#x201C;all work,&#x201D; as the Gemara expresses it. Now Ramban has already explained above that the real intention of this verse in Deuteronomy is &#x201C;servile work,&#x201D; and the reason why it mentions &#x201C;work,&#x201D; is because Scripture has already explained (in Exodus 12:16 &#x2014; see Note 215), that it applies specifically to &#x201C;servile work.&#x201D; The argument of the Gemara, however, merely proceeds on the basis of the expression as stated there in Deuteronomy. Further on in the text Ramban will again remove this difficulty in accordance with this line of thought, by saying that the Gemara is merely following the expressio of the verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2187">(228) Deuteronomy 16:8. The definite article in [<italic>ha&#x2019;shvi&#x2019;i</italic>] is limiting, meaning: only on the seventh day are you so restricted, but not on the preceding intermediate days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2188">(229) Sifre, <italic>R&#x2019;eih</italic> 135.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2190">(231) Numbers 28:18 (with respect to the first day of Passover).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2191">(232) In Exodus 12:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2192">(233) Now this Beraitha is clearly in contradiction to Ramban&#x2019;s opinion above, that the term <italic>&#x2018;m&#x2019;lecheth avodah&#x2019;</italic> (servile work) does <italic>not</italic> include a prohibition against preparing necessary food on a festival. For if so, seeing that with respect to the first day of Passover it states in Numbers 28:18: <italic>Ye shall do no manner of &#x2018;m&#x2019;lecheth avodah,&#x2019;</italic> why then did the Sifre have to search for a special source to establish the permissibility of preparing necessary food? Ramban will now proceed to remove this contradiction.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2200">(241) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Emor</italic> 10:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2201">(242) So also further on in Verse 24 [in connection with the New Year], and Verse 34 [in connection with the Festival of Tabernacles]. The reason why that expression is not found in connection with the Festival of Weeks and the Day of Atonement will be explained in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2202">(243) Literally: &#x201C;a measure.&#x201D; This refers to the meal-offering of the new barley brought on the second day of Passover, which is the sixteenth day of Nisan. From that day on we count the forty-nine &#x201C;days of the <italic>omer</italic>,&#x201D; and on the fiftieth day is the Festival of Weeks. Thus it is clear that the time of this festival is dependent upon the <italic>omer</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2203">(244) Deuteronomy 16:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2204">(245) Menachoth 66 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2205">(246) Verse 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2206">(247) Ramban&#x2019;s language here follows that of Verse 39 with reference to the eight days of Tabernacles.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2207">(248) Verse 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2208">(249) Verse 16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2209">(250) Verse 15 reads: <italic>And ye shall count unto you from the morrow of &#x2018;ha&#x2019;shabbath&#x2019; &#x2026; seven &#x2018;shabbathoth&#x2019; shall there be complete</italic>. According to Onkelos the first <italic>ha&#x2019;shabbath</italic> means &#x201C;the festival,&#x201D; while the second <italic>shabbathoth</italic> means &#x201C;weeks.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2210">(251) So interpreted by Ibn Ezra.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2211">(252) Judges 10:4. Also quoted by Ramban in Exodus 3:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2212">(253) II Kings 11:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2213">(254) Amos 8:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2214">(255) For thus we say: &#x201C;This is the first day in the Sabbath, etc.&#x201D; See Ramban to Exodus 12:2, and 20:8 (Vol. II, pp. 116-7, 313).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2215">(256) Kethuboth 2 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2216">(257) Verse 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2217">(258) Verse 5. &#x2014; Thus it is clear that the Festival of Passover begins on the fourteenth of Nisan at dusk, and the first <italic>day</italic> of the festival is the next day, i.e., the fifteenth. Hence <italic>on the morrow after &#x2018;ha&#x2019;shabbath&#x2019;</italic> must refer to the expression <italic>and on the fifteenth day</italic> etc. (in Verse 6), thus establishing that it is on the <italic>sixteenth</italic> day of Nisan that we are to begin a new week &#x2014; the first of the seven complete weeks.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2218">(259) Literally: &#x201C;Even unto <italic>from</italic> the morrow after the seventh week &#x2026;&#x201D; This cannot be understood literally, for it would mean that the festival day of Shevuoth is to be observed on the day &#x201C;<italic>from</italic> the morrow after the seventh week, i.e., <italic>on the following day after the morrow</italic> of the seven weeks.&#x201D; Instead, it must mean: &#x201C;Even unto <italic>on</italic> the morrow &#x2026;&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2219">(260) Above, 19:6. See in my Hebrew commentary p. 148 Note 36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2220">(261) I have not identified these scholars.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2221">(262) Exodus 18:13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2222">(263) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 9:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2223">(264) Further, Verse 40.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2224">(265) This may refer to what the Rabbis have said: &#x201C;It is obligatory to count the days, and it is obligatory to count the weeks&#x201D; (Menachoth 66 a). Thus we say e.g., &#x201C;This is the tenth day, making one week and three days of the <italic>omer</italic>.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2225">(266) Above, 15:13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2226">(267) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2227">(268) But otherwise the man or woman suffering a flux [i.e., <italic>zav</italic> or <italic>zavah</italic>] is under no obligation to proceed with the purification. Hence &#x201C;the counting&#x201D; of the seven clean days which the Torah mentioned that they must do could not be in the nature of a positive act &#x2014; counting by word of mouth &#x2014; but merely a warning that they should not forget their state of impurity. However, in the case of the counting of the <italic>omer</italic>, this reasoning is inapplicable, since the observance of Shevuoth on the fiftieth day is not a matter of choice, hence &#x201C;the counting&#x201D; must mean by word of mouth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2228">(269) Further 25:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2229">(270) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Behar</italic> 2:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2230">(271) Thus the counting would be done e.g., in the following manner: &#x201C;This year is the twentieth year, making two Sabbatical cycles and six years of the Jubilee.&#x201D; See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, pp. 148-149.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2231">(272) See <italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 144.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2232">(273) Perhaps the thought conveyed here is as explained above (in Verse 11) that these seven weeks are not determined from the start of the regular cycle of weeks, but by these forty-nine days which are counted from the day of the waving of the sheaf, on whatever day of the week it may take place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2233">(274) Numbers 28:19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2234">(275) The thought is similar to a principle stated by the Sages: &#x201C;Every addition of a limb is considered equivalent to the entire absence of the respective limb [in an animal or fowl]&#x201D; (Chullin 58 b).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2235">(276) Ruth 1:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2236">(277) Above, 2:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2237">(278) As specified in Verse 12: <italic>And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt-offering unto the Eternal</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2238">(279) Job 5:26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2239">(280) As specified in Verse 18: <italic>And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs &#x2026;</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2240">(281) Numbers 28:18-31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2241">(282) Menachoth 68 b: &#x201C;The <italic>omer</italic> [the meal-offering of <italic>barley</italic> brought on the second day of Passover] made the new crop permissible in the country [i.e., for private consumption], and &#x2018;the two loaves&#x2019; [which were brought on the Festival of Weeks] made it permissible for use in the Sanctuary.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2242">(283) Verse 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2243">(284) Verse 21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2244">(285) When the Sanctuary stood, the offering of the <italic>omer</italic> at any time on the sixteenth day of Nisan at once rendered <italic>chadash</italic> (the new crop) permissible food. Since the destruction of the Sanctuary, the prohibition extends to the whole day of the sixteenth of Nisan (Rosh Hashanah 30 a-b; see also &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. II, pp. 186-188).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2263">(304) Above, 7:13 &#x2014; It is important to note that neither the two leavened loaves of the Festival of Weeks nor the leavened cakes of a thanks-offering were burnt on the altar, as leaven is forbidden to be burnt on the altar.

<ftnote id="fn2273">(314) Vayikra Rabbah 9:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2274">(315) This is generally understood as meaning that since there will be no sin in the World to Come, there will not be an occasion to bring the sin-offering etc. See Ramban above, 1:4 that the burnt-offering, too, atones for sin. But for the thanks-offering there will always be an occasion. Ramban, however, alludes to a mystic interpretation, namely, that since the World to Come represents the life of perfect harmony, it is symbolized by the thanks-offering in which the leavened and the unleavened are combined, whereas in the present world justice and mercy are not always combined (see Ramban further, on Verse 24 towards the end, about the nature of the New Year and the Day of Atonement).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2278">(319) Shebuoth 10 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2279">(320) This is alluded to in the vecse, <italic>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</italic> (above, Verse 4), thus teaching that all festivals are alike with respect to a positive commandment [to rest thereon] and a negative commandment [not to do work], even though in the case of some festivals, [as the text continues], the positive commandment is not clearly set forth in Scripture.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2283">(324) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2284">(325) &#x201C;Since the expression <italic>holy convocation</italic> is stated both with reference to the first and seventh days of Passover (<italic>ibid.</italic>, Verse 16), and the intermediate days of the festival are similarly termed [in the verse, <italic>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal, even holy convocations</italic> &#x2014; Verse 4 in the section before us], therefore just as activities called <italic>sh&#x2019;vuth</italic> are forbidden on the first and seventh days, so are they also forbidden on the intermediate days of the festival.&#x201D; &#x2014; So it could be argued.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2285">(326) Further, Verse 39.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2286">(327) There are thirty-nine main classes of &#x201C;work&#x201D; (Shabbath 73 a). Their subspecies are also subject to the same regulations (Baba Kama 2 a). The intention here, then, is to find a source for such kinds of activity which are neither &#x201C;work&#x201D; nor any of its derivatives. Examples are mentioned further on in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2287">(328) Nehemiah 13:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2288">(329) Aboth 3:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2289">(330) See Ramban in Exodus 12:16 (towards the end) where he refers to this interpretation that he intended yet to write, and see also there, p. 134, Note 213.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2290">(331) The standard Mechilta being that of Rabbi Yishmael [a colleague of Rabbi Akiba], Ramban here refers to another Mechilta which he specifies by name: &#x201C;the Mechilta of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai.&#x201D; Hence the epithet &#x201C;the other Mechilta.&#x201D; [See, however, in Vol. I, p. 603, where this epithet is not used by Ramban.] Rabbi Shimon was a pupil of Rabbi Akiba. The text quoted is found in that work on Exodus 12:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2291">(332) Exodus 12:16, stated with reference to the first and seventh days of Passover.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2292">(333) In Verse 24 before us with reference to the New Year, and as explained above all festivals have been likened one to another. See Note 320.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2295">(336) Exodus 20:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2296">(337) For of the Sabbath it is likewise said <italic>shabbathon</italic> (here in Verse 3): <italic>Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh it is a Sabbath of &#x2018;shabbathon&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>solemn rest</italic>).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2299">(340) Moed Katan 12 a. Thus since the Rabbis forbade even a <italic>sh&#x2019;vuth</italic> involving only speech, it is clear that they prohibited every <italic>sh&#x2019;vuth</italic> involving action.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2300">(341) In the Additional Service of the New Year, ten Biblical verses which speak of G-d as King of the universe are recited; so also ten verses which speak of Divine Remembrance, and ten which speak of the role of the <italic>Shofar</italic>. See in Vol. I, p. 268 Note 318.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2301">(342) Numbers 10:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2302">(343) In Verse 9 <italic>ibid.</italic>, it states already, <italic>and ye shall be remembered before the Eternal your G-d</italic>. Why then is it said in Verse 10 again, <italic>I am the Eternal your G-d?</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2303">(344) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Emor</italic> 11:2.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2305">(346) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 34 b. The Gemara there brings a Beraitha as follows: &#x201C;If there are two cities, in one of which they blow the <italic>Shofar</italic> [but there is no-one who can recite the Additional Service of the New Year with the special verses about G-d&#x2019;s Sovereignty etc.], and in the other they recite the Service but have no <italic>Shofar</italic>, then we are to go&#x201D; etc., as Ramban continues.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2306">(347) Even if there is only a doubt whether there will be a <italic>Shofar</italic> in one community, whilst in the other it is certain that they will recite the Service, but without the sounding of the <italic>Shofar</italic>, the Beraitha teaches that we are yet to go to the place where there is a possibility of the <italic>Shofar</italic> being blown, even though there is a doubt about it.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2313">(354) &#x201C;Up to Moses our teacher, and it is still with us as a matter of tradition and as is known in the Talmud. And he who has been worthy to be a student of the secrets of the Torah, will see the subject expressed more clearly in Scripture, and the expressions of the Torah will be better understood by him, for <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic> has stood by our fathers etc.&#x201D; (see text here) (Ramban in his Sermon on Rosh Hashanah, Kithvei Haramban, I, p. 220).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2314">(355) Psalms 89:16. &#x201C;And what does this verse mean? It cannot be understood literally, for there are many peoples who know how to make the <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic> (the quavering sound) on trumpets and ram&#x2019;s horns, and yet their portion is unhappiness, and similarly we find the contrary&#x0021; Rather, <italic>t&#x2019;ruah</italic> is symbolic of the attribute of justice &#x2026; and the sense of the verse is: <italic>Happy is the people that know the &#x2018;t&#x2018;ruah,&#x2019;</italic> that possesses the knowledge of cleaving the G-d in time of <italic>t&#x2018;ruah</italic>, for the term &#x2018;knowing&#x2019; is used for attachment, as it is written, <italic>And the man &#x2018;knew&#x2019; Eve his wife&#x201D;</italic> (Genesis 4:1) (Kithvei Haramban, I, p. 220).

<ftnote id="fn2319">(360) Since the word <italic>Shofar</italic> [the ram&#x2019;s horn] is symbolic of mercy, it is already hinted at in the word &#x201C;day&#x201D; which likewise symbolizes mercy (L&#x2019;vush in his commentary to Ricanti quoting the language of Ramban).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2320">(361) Further, 25:9. &#x201C;[The Day of Atonement in] <italic>the Jubilee year is like the New Year in respect of the blowing of the Shofar</italic>&#x201D; (Rosh Hashanah 26 b).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2384">(425) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Emor</italic> 14:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2385">(426) The word <italic>atzereth</italic> is of the root <italic>atzor</italic> (to hold back, restrain). Rashi will accordingly explain that the eighth day of Tabernacles is the day G-d requested Israel &#x201C;to hold back&#x201D; yet another day before leaving for their homes. Ramban will explain <italic>atzereth</italic> in the sense of &#x201C;binding,&#x201D; or &#x201C;holding in,&#x201D; because this day represents the assembly of all emanations alluded to by all festivals, as mentioned in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2386">(427) I did not find it in Vayikra Rabbah. See though Tractate Succah 55 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2387">(428) Exodus 20:11. See also Vol. I, p. 28: &#x201C;In the profounder sense etc.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2388">(429) To each of the first six days of the week there is, so-to-say a partner, but the seventh odd day has no partner. And since blessing does not come solitary, G-d gave the congregation of Israel to be the Sabbath&#x2019;s partner (Bereshith Rabbah 11:9). See also Vol. I, p. 60.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2389">(430) Numbers 16:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2390">(431) The thought suggested is that the seven &#x201C;weeks&#x201D; of the <italic>omer</italic> are comparable to &#x201C;the days&#x201D; of the world, and <italic>Shevuoth</italic> is thus like the &#x201C;eighth day&#x201D; in the Festival of Tabernacles; and the forty-nine days between the first day and &#x201C;the eighth day&#x201D; are thus like the intermediate days of the Festival of Tabernacles (Abusaula).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2391">(432) Deuteronomy 4:36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2392">(433) As in Chagigah 17 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2393">(434) Rosh Hashanah 4 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2394">(435) This is an acrostic for the following Hebrew words: <italic>pa&#x2019;yis</italic> (lots), <italic>z&#x2019;man</italic> (time), <italic>regel</italic> (festival), <italic>korban</italic> (offering), <italic>shir</italic> (song), <italic>brachah</italic> (blessing). These are all references to various laws indicating that the eighth day of Tabernacles is not considered as just another day of that festival, but is rather an independent festival by itself. Such acrostics were used in order to assist memory.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2395">(436) Thus: &#x201C;He that made no offerings on the first festival day of Tabernacles, must offer them any day throughout the whole festival, even on the last [i.e., the eighth] day of Tabernacles&#x201D; (Chagigah 9 a). In that respect the eighth day <italic>is</italic> connected with the first seven days.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2410">(451) Verse 41.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2411">(452) &#x201C;And why does Scripture (in Deuteronomy 16:15) state <italic>seven?</italic> It is with reference to the supplementary period &#x2014; that if he has not brought the Festival-offering on one day, he may bring it on another of the seven days&#x201D; (Torath Kohanim, <italic>Emor</italic> 17:2); and on the Festival of Tabernacles, he may bring it even on the eighth day (<italic>ibid.</italic>, 3). See above, Note 436.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2412">(453) Succah 35 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2413">(454) Genesis 2:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2414">(455) Exodus 20:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2415">(456) In our version of Onkelos <italic>lo theirog</italic> is given as the translation of the Hebrew <italic>&#x2018;lo thithaveh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>Thou shalt not desire</italic>) &#x2014; in Deuteronomy 5:18. In Exodus 20:14, the Aramaic is the same as the Hebrew: <italic>lo thachameid</italic>. &#x2014; The general point, however, is clearly established, that the term <italic>theirog</italic> means &#x201C;desire,&#x201D; &#x201C;delight&#x201D; or &#x201C;pleasant.&#x201D; The name <italic>ethrog</italic> is related to this expression.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2416">(457) The source of the expression is found in Targum Jonathan to Psalms 45:14. From Ramban&#x2019;s words &#x201C;we say,&#x201D; it would seem that he is referring to that phrase written in the marriage contract wherein the husband undertakes to pay to his wife a certain sum of money &#x201C;from all the best, most desirable of his belongings.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2417">(458) In other words, since the Rabbis have interpreted the phrase <italic>and ye shall take you</italic> as meaning that the taking of the four species is to be done by each person, therefore Onkelos translated it: &#x201C;and you [all] shall take <italic>ethrogin, lulavin</italic> etc. [in the plural] since the Torah is speaking here to all individuals together. Hence even though it is written <italic>branches of palm-trees</italic> in the plural, yet we only have to take one branch of a palm-tree, the plural being used because the phrase is connected with <italic>and ye shall take you</italic>, which refers to many people.</ftnote>

Ramban is now to differ with this opinion, and holds that since Abraham entered the covenant, he and his seed already enjoyed that status later defined as that of Israelites, and under such law the son of the Israelite woman assumed her status, and hence there was no need for his official conversion.

<h1>25</h1>
<p>1. AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN MOUNT SINAI. &#x201C;What has the subject of the Sabbatical year [stated here in this section] to do with that of Mount Sinai? Were not all the commandments declared on Sinai? [It is to teach us that] just as [this law of] the Sabbatical year was ordained on Sinai with its general rules, its specific prescripts and its minute details, so also were all [the commandments] ordained on Sinai with their general rules, and their specific prescripts and their minute details. Thus it is taught [here] in the Torath Kohanin. It appears to me<sup><xref rid="fn2505">1</xref></sup> that the following is the interpretation thereof: Since we do not find the law of the resting of the soil [in the Sabbatical year] repeated in the plains of Moab [when Moses restated the law, as contained in the Book of Deuteronomy], we must deduce that all the general rules and specific prescripts [of the Sabbatical year, including those of the resting of the soil] were declared on Sinai. [Why then was it necessary for Scripture to state here <italic>in Mount Sinai</italic>, since it is self-understood that this entire law was promulgated on Sinai, since the law of the resting of the soil is not mentioned in the Book of Deuteronomy? We must say that the reason] Scripture mentioned [the phrase <italic>in Mount Sinai</italic>] here is in order to teach that every communication [i.e., commandment] that was spoken to Moses on Sinai, was given at Sinai together with its general rules and minute details, and they were [merely] repeated and taught again in the plains of Moab.&#x201D; Thus far is the language of Rashi.</p>
<p>But this does not appear to me to be correct at all. For there are many commandments like the Sabbatical year which were not repeated in the plains of Moab, and [all] we know about their general rules and specific prescripts is that they were promulgated either on Sinai or in the Tent of Meeting [but not specifically on Sinai, as Rashi said]&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn2506">2</xref></sup> Moreover, how do we know that the other commandments which were repeated in the plains of Moab are to be likened to the Sabbatical year [which was not repeated? Perhaps this analogy applies only to those commandments which were <italic>not</italic> repeated in the plains of Moab, like the Sabbatical year; but how do we know that the analogy applies also to those that <italic>were</italic> repeated by Moses in the plains of Moab, as contained in the Book of Deuteronomy? And how do we know that in the case of those commandments that <italic>were</italic> repeated by Moses], that only the general rules were declared on Sinai but the specific prescripts were given in the plains of Moab&#x0021; And indeed it would be more logical to say so, that those commandments which were repeated by Moses, were restated for the sake of explaining their specific prescripts, since on Sinai only their general rules had been declared&#x0021;</p>
<p>But the interpretation of the above Beraitha is clear: The general rules of the Sabbatical year were declared on Sinai, as it is written in the section of <italic>&#x2018;V&#x2019;eileh Hamishpatim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>And these are the ordinances</italic>):<sup><xref rid="fn2507">3</xref></sup> <italic>And on the seventh year thou shalt let it</italic> [i.e., the Land] <italic>rest and lie fallow, that the poor of thy people may eat</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2508">4</xref></sup> These are the laws of the Sabbatical year in a general way. Here He went back [to this subject] and said that <italic>in Mount Sinai</italic> all its specific prescripts were also given, since all of them are mentioned in this section. And at the end of this subject it is written, <italic>These are the commandments, which the Eternal commanded Moses for the children of Israel in Mount Sinai</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2509">5</xref></sup> in order to liken all the commandments to the Sabbatical year [previously] mentioned, [teaching] that all of them, likewise, were stated in general terms and with their particular details &#x2014; that is, all were declared on Sinai. And thus it is taught there in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn2510">6</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>These are the commandments</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2509">5</xref></sup> Henceforth no prophet may promulgate any new thing.<sup><xref rid="fn2511">7</xref></sup> <italic>Which the Eternal commanded Moses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2509">5</xref></sup> The messenger was [found] deserving before Him Who sent him [since he was the most perfect of all human beings].<sup><xref rid="fn2512">8</xref></sup> <italic>Moses for the children of Israel</italic>. It was the merit of Israel that caused [the Divine Glory to rest upon Moses].<sup><xref rid="fn2513">9</xref></sup> <italic>In Mount Sinai</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2509">5</xref></sup> [this teaches] that all commandments originated at Sinai.&#x201D; Thus far is the text in the Torath Kohanim. But the reason [that the laws were repeated] in the plains of Moab was only for the purpose of explaining the Torah to the children [of those who had left Egypt, who were born in the wilderness after the Giving of the Torah at Sinai]. This appears to me to be the interpretation [of the Beraitha of the Torath Kohanim mentioned] and &#x201C;it is well and nicely said.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2514">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the reason why this section [of the laws of the Sabbatical year] was written here, Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained to be as follows: This is the covenant which was written in the section of <italic>&#x2018;V&#x2019;eileh Hamishpatim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>And these are the ordinances</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2515">11</xref></sup> and when the people accepted it upon themselves [by saying] <italic>we will do, and obey</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2516">12</xref></sup> then the covenant was made,<sup><xref rid="fn2517">13</xref></sup> and [Moses] told them this whole section [containing the laws of the Sabbatical year]. Scripture mentioned it in this place in order to put in proximity all the conditions [He laid down for Israel&#x2019;s inheriting] the Land; for just as He said with reference to forbidden sexual relations that on account of them the Land will vomit them out,<sup><xref rid="fn2518">14</xref></sup> so He said in the section of <italic>&#x2018;Im Bechukothai&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>If ye walk in My statutes</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2519">15</xref></sup> with regard to [not keeping the laws of] the Sabbaths of the Land,<sup><xref rid="fn2520">16</xref></sup> and therefore it was necessary that He mention [here] first [what are the laws of] the Sabbatical years.</p>
<p>In my opinion this section is written here in its proper order, for the expression <italic>in Mount Sinai</italic> means when Moses went up there to receive the <italic>second</italic> Tablets [and does not refer, as Ibn Ezra interprets it, to the time immediately after the Giving of the Torah, even before Moses went up the mountain to receive the <italic>first</italic> Tablets of the Law], and the explanation of the matter is as follows: At the beginning of the first forty days of the first Tablets, Moses wrote in the Book of the Covenant <italic>all the words of the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2521">17</xref></sup> and all the ordinances stated there [in that section],<sup><xref rid="fn2522">18</xref></sup> and he sprinkled the blood of the covenant upon the people.<sup><xref rid="fn2517">13</xref></sup> But when the people sinned with the [golden] calf and the Tablets were broken, that was equivalent to a breaking of the covenant with the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore when the Holy One, blessed be He, became reconciled to Moses by giving him the second Tablets, He commanded him concerning a new covenant, as it is said, <italic>Behold, I make a covenant;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2523">19</xref></sup> and He repeated there the stringent commandments that had been said in the section of <italic>&#x2018;V&#x2019;eileh Hamishpatim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>And these are the ordinances</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2524">20</xref></sup> at the first covenant, and He [now] stated, <italic>Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2525">21</xref></sup> Now the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to make this second covenant with them with greater stringency, and that it should be upon them by means of oaths and curses, and that it should cover, like the first one, all the original commandments and all the ordinances, as it is said of the first covenant, <italic>And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Eternal, and all the ordinances</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2526">22</xref></sup> Therefore Scripture states here at the end of the exhortations, <italic>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which the Eternal made between Him and the children of Israel, in Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2527">23</xref></sup> this being an allusion to all the commandments and ordinances which had been said at the first covenant, in the section of <italic>&#x2018;V&#x2019;eileh Hamishpatim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>And these are the ordinances</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2524">20</xref></sup> for they were all embodied in this [second] covenant.</p>
<p>Now in the Book of the first Covenant, the law of the Sabbatical year was stated in a general way as I have mentioned, as it is said, <italic>And on the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn2508">4</xref></sup> and now in this second convenant it was said with its specific prescripts, its minute details, and its penalties. At the time of the first covenant, during the first forty days [after the Giving of the Torah, when Moses went up to the mountain], Moses was commanded concerning the building of the Tabernacle; and when the Holy One, blessed be He, became reconciled to him and commanded him to make a second covenant for them, Moses came down [from the mountain] <italic>and he gave them in commandment all that the Eternal had spoken with him in Mount Sinai</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2528">24</xref></sup> including the making of the Tabernacle. Then <italic>Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them</italic> as at first, <italic>These are the words which the Eternal hath commanded that ye should do them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2529">25</xref></sup> when making the Tabernacle. Now they accepted the charge joyfully, and departed from his presence at once, and they all came back and brought the donations, and made the Tabernacle and completed its construction. And as soon as it was set up, <italic>He</italic> immediately <italic>called unto Moses, and the Eternal spoke unto him out of the Tent of Meeting</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2530">26</xref></sup> and He commanded him regarding the offerings and the whole <italic>Torath Kohanim</italic> [&#x201C;law of the priests,&#x201D; i.e., the Book of Leviticus], and Moses immediately commanded them all to Aaron and his sons and to all the children of Israel. When he had finished, he said to them: &#x201C;G-d further commanded me in Mount Sinai to explain to you [the laws of] the Sabbatical year and of the Jubilee, and to make a new covenant with you concerning all the commandments and ordinances, by means of adjuration and oath.&#x201D; It was not necessary now [for Moses] to slaughter offerings and sprinkle half of the blood upon the people and half upon the altar, as he had done at the first covenant,<sup><xref rid="fn2531">27</xref></sup> because now they were [again] accepting upon themselves the original covenant, with these oaths and adjurations. This is the sense of the expression, <italic>which the Eternal made between Him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2527">23</xref></sup> for it was He Who made with them this [second] covenant, having forgiven them on the basis of these conditions [i.e., the oaths and adjurations mentioned further on in Chapter 26], as I have explained at the end of [<italic>Seder</italic>] <italic>Ki Thisa</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2532">28</xref></sup> Similarly, the covenant at the plains of Moab<sup><xref rid="fn2533">29</xref></sup> was made likewise, by means of the people accepting upon themselves the Torah with those oaths and adjurations [mentioned in Deuteronomy Chapter 28], this being the covenant, as it is said, <italic>These are the words of the covenant which the Eternal commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which He made with them in Horeb</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2534">30</xref></sup> The Rabbis of blessed memory have spoken the truth in saying<sup><xref rid="fn2535">31</xref></sup> that among the conditions on which the Land [was given by G-d to Israel] are [those of observing the laws of] the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee, as He will mention in the exhortations,<sup><xref rid="fn2536">32</xref></sup> and they are clearly expressed in this second covenant [as referring to the commandments in this section].</p>
<p>2. A SABBATH UNTO THE ETERNAL, &#x201C;[This means] in honor of the Eternal [and that it is not primarily intended for man&#x2019;s benefit],<sup><xref rid="fn2537">33</xref></sup> in the same sense as this expression is used in the case of the Sabbath of Creation&#x201D; [i.e., the weekly Sabbath, of which it is also said, <italic>a Sabbath unto the Eternal</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2538">34</xref></sup> This is the language of Rashi. But this was not the intention of the Rabbis in their interpretation,<sup><xref rid="fn2539">35</xref></sup> for all [weekly] Sabbaths, and also the festivals, are in honor of the Eternal, and yet in not one of them [i.e., the festivals] does Scripture say that they are &#x201C;unto the Eternal.&#x201D; Instead, it says <italic>it shall be a solemn rest unto you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2540">36</xref></sup> and in the case of the Day of Atonement it states, <italic>It shall be unto you a Sabbath of solemn rest</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2541">37</xref></sup> The text of the Beraitha in the Torah Kohanim [quoted by Rashi] is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn2542">38</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>A Sabbath unto the Eternal</italic>. Just as it says with reference to the Sabbath of Creation, so is it said regarding the Sabbatical year, <italic>a Sabbath unto the Eternal</italic>.&#x201D; But the meaning of <italic>a Sabbath unto the Eternal thy G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2538">34</xref></sup> stated in connection with the Sabbath of Creation, is that <italic>on it He ceased from work and rested</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2543">39</xref></sup> and therefore <italic>thou shalt not do any manner of work</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2538">34</xref></sup> It was with reference to that idea that the Sages, of blessed memory, said that the same expression is also stated in the case of the Sabbatical year, since it is the seventh in [the cycle of] the years [just as the weekly Sabbath is the seventh day in the cycle of days; and the meaning thereof here is that since the seventh year is <italic>a Sabbath to the Eternal</italic>, as will be explained, we are to desist from working the land].</p>
<p>Now here [in the Torath Kohanim mentioned above, the Rabbis] have roused our attention to one of the great secrets of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2544">40</xref></sup> Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has already given us a hint of it when he wrote: &#x201C;The meaning of <italic>a Sabbath unto the Eternal</italic> is like that of the Sabbath-day.<sup><xref rid="fn2545">41</xref></sup> The secret of the years of the world is alluded to in this place.&#x201D; [Thus far is Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s comment.]</p>
<p>Bend now your ear to understand that which I am permitted to inform you about it in the words that I will cause you to hear, and if you will be worthy, you will contemplate them [and understand them]. I have already written in <italic>Seder Bereshith</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2546">42</xref></sup> that the six days of creation represent [all] the days of the world, <italic>and the seventh day is a Sabbath unto the Eternal thy G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2538">34</xref></sup> for on it will be the Sabbath to the Great Name, just as we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup><xref rid="fn2547">43</xref></sup> &#x201C;On the seventh day what psalm did the Levites sing [in the Sanctuary? They sang] <italic>A Psalm, a Song. For the Sabbath-day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2548">44</xref></sup> &#x2014; [a song] for the World to Come, which will be wholly a Sabbath, and rest for life everlasting.&#x201D; Thus the [seven] days [of the week] allude to that which He created in the process of creation, and the [seven] years [of the Sabbatical cycle] refer to that which will occur during the creation of all &#x201C;the days&#x201D; of the world. It is for this reason that Scripture was more stringent regarding [the transgression of the laws of] the Sabbatical year than with respect to those guilty of transgressing all other negative commandments, and made it punishable with exile, just as He was stringent with respect to forbidden sexual relations [for which the punishment of the people, as opposed to that of the individual, is also exile];<sup><xref rid="fn2549">45</xref></sup> as it is said, <italic>Then shall the Land be paid her Sabbaths</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2550">46</xref></sup> and He repeated this matter many times: <italic>As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2551">47</xref></sup> and it is further said, <italic>And the Land shall lie forsaken without them, and shall be paid her Sabbaths</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2552">48</xref></sup> &#x201C;And so we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup><xref rid="fn2553">49</xref></sup> &#x201C;Exile comes for the delaying of justice, and for the perversion of justice, and for [the neglect of] the year of rest for the Land.&#x201D; [This stringency of punishment is] because whoever denies it [i.e., the law of the Sabbatical year], does not acknowledge the work of creation and [life in] the World to Come. Similarly the prophet [Jeremiah] was stringent, and decreed exile for neglecting to send [Hebrew] servants to freedom in the seventh year [of their service], as it is said, <italic>I made a covenant with your fathers &#x2026; At the beginning of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn2554">50</xref></sup> for in the case of a servant the seventh year is also like a [complete] Jubilee; and the Jubilee is known also [at the very beginning of the Torah] &#x2014; from <italic>&#x2018;Bereshith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>In the beginning</italic>) to <italic>&#x2018;Vayechulu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>And there were finished</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2555">51</xref></sup> &#x2014; intimating that in the Jubilee everything is to return [to its origin], <italic>every man unto his possession, and every man unto his family</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2556">52</xref></sup> For it is <italic>a sure foundation</italic>, and <italic>he that believeth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2557">53</xref></sup> shall keep silence. This is what is meant in saying, <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;shavtah ha&#x2019;aretz shabbath&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and &#x2018;the land&#x2019; shall keep a Sabbath</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn2558">54</xref></sup> <italic>and ye shall proclaim liberty &#x2018;ba&#x2019;aretz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>throughout &#x2018;the land&#x2019;</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2559">55</xref></sup> for the reference here is to &#x201C;the land of eternal life&#x201D; which is alluded to in the first verse [of the Torah],<sup><xref rid="fn2560">56</xref></sup> and of which it is said, <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;ha&#x2019;aretz ezkor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and I will remember &#x2018;the land&#x2019;</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2561">57</xref></sup> I have already mentioned this several times.<sup><xref rid="fn2562">58</xref></sup> Perhaps it is to this that our Rabbis alluded in saying:<sup><xref rid="fn2563">59</xref></sup> &#x201C;Fifty gates [degrees] of understanding were created in the world, and all were transmitted to Moses with one exception.&#x201D; For each cycle of seven years constitutes &#x201C;the gate of one house&#x201D; [creation], and thus He informed him of all existence from beginning to end, with the exception of the holy Jubilee.</p>
<p>3. SIX YEARS THOU SHALT SOW THY FIELD. Such is the way of Scripture to state [i.e., it is not a <italic>command</italic> that is expressed here, but it is merely the style of Scripture], just as it says, <italic>Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2564">60</xref></sup> <italic>Six days thou shalt do thy work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2565">61</xref></sup> According to the way of our Rabbis [the verse is to be interpreted as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn2566">62</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Six years thou shalt sow thy field</italic> &#x2014; but not in the seventh year &#x2014; this being a negative commandment which is derived from a positive commandment, and carries the force of a positive commandment.&#x201D; Thus he who sows [his field] in the seventh year violates this positive commandment, and also the negative commandment [expressed in the verse, <italic>thou shalt not sow thy field</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2567">63</xref></sup> A homiletic exposition of the Rabbis is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn2568">64</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Yishmael says: When Israel does the will of G-d, it has to observe only one year of rest [of the soil] in a seven-year cycle, as it is said, <italic>Six years thou shalt sow thy field</italic>. But if the people do not do the will of G-d, they have to make four &#x2018;years of rest&#x2019; of the soil in one seven-year cycle. How so? He plows for one year and cannot sow until the next year, again he plows for one year and cannot sow until the next year. Thus there are four &#x2018;years of rest&#x2019; in one seven-year cycle.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2569">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. &#x2018;ETH S&#x2019;FIACH K&#x2019;TZIRCHA&#x2019; (THAT WHICH GROWETH OF ITSELF OF THY HARVEST) THOU SHALT NOT REAP. &#x201C;Even if you did not sow it, but it grew from the seed that had fallen [into the ground] at the time of the harvest [of the sixth year], and it is that which is called <italic>&#x2018;s&#x2019;fiach&#x2019;</italic> (aftergrowth) &#x2014; <italic>thou shalt not reap</italic>, to take possession of it like other harvests, but is to be free for everyone. AND THE GRAPES OF &#x2018;N&#x2019;ZIRECHA&#x2019; &#x2014; which you have barred and separated from people, and not declared ownerless &#x2014; THOU SHALT NOT GATHER them. You may only gather them after they have been declared free for all.&#x201D; Thus the language of Rashi.</p>
<p>The Rabbi&#x2019;s [i.e., Rashi&#x2019;s] meaning by [writing] this is because he is of the opinion that if a person guards his field and his fruits in the Sabbatical year [at the time of growth, and afterwards he declares them free for all], the produce does not become prohibited [as food]. So also did he [Rashi] write in his commentaries to Tractate Yebamoth<sup><xref rid="fn2570">66</xref></sup> and to Tractate Succah.<sup><xref rid="fn2571">67</xref></sup> This is indeed so according to the law of the Torah, as is established by clear proofs. And that which is taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn2572">68</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And the grapes of &#x2018;n&#x2019;zirecha&#x2019; thou shalt not gather</italic>. From that which was guarded when in the soil [i.e., when it is in the process of growth] you shall not gather, but you may gather from that which was made free for all&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2573">69</xref></sup> &#x2014; the Rabbi [Rashi] will explain it in the following way: &#x201C;Grapes which have been kept away from people you may not gather as long as they are so barred; you must rather declare them all ownerless, and then you may gather them together with the poor.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The correct interpretation of the verse is that the expression <italic>the grapes of &#x2018;n&#x2019;zirecha&#x2019;</italic> is like <italic>&#x2018;s&#x2019;fiach&#x2019; of thy harvest</italic>, and <italic>thou shalt not gather</italic> is like <italic>thou shalt not reap</italic>, for the purport of the whole section is to state a twofold law to the Israelites &#x2014; warning with respect to fields and warning again with reference to vineyards. Thus: <italic>thou shalt sow thy field &#x2026; thou shalt prune thy vineyard;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2574">70</xref></sup> <italic>thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2575">71</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>And six years thou shalt sow thy Land &#x2026; but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow &#x2026; In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2576">72</xref></sup> And the meaning of the verse [here] is that that which grows by itself in a field without intentional plowing and sowing is called &#x201C;<italic>s&#x2019;fiach</italic> of the harvest,&#x201D; because it is &#x201C;attached&#x201D; to the harvest of the past year, this term being of the root, <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;nispechu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and they shall cleave</italic>) <italic>to the house of Jacob</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2577">73</xref></sup> Likewise the vine which has not been cultivated, nor hoed or pruned, is called <italic>nazir</italic>, because [the owner] &#x201C;held himself aloof and put it away from him&#x201D; as if it were not his, of the root, <italic>because &#x2018;nazoru&#x2019; from Me through their idols</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2578">74</xref></sup> [which means] &#x201C;they separated themselves from Me.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;yinazru&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and they separate themselves</italic>) <italic>from the holy things of the children of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2579">75</xref></sup> And Onkelos [also] translates here [<italic>and the grapes of &#x2018;n&#x2019;zirecha&#x2019;</italic>] as <italic>shivkach</italic>, which means [those grapes that] &#x201C;you have left&#x201D; to be <italic>for briers and thorns</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2580">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that the custom in Israel was that a vineyard <italic>which was uncultivated, neither pruned nor hoed, and in which briers and thorns</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2581">77</xref></sup> <italic>grew up</italic>, they called <italic>nazir</italic>, that is to say, it is a vineyard of the Nazirite, since the Nazirite is forbidden to drink wine <italic>nor eat fresh grapes or dried</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2582">78</xref></sup> and he does not cultivate his vineyard. They also gave a name to long hair derived from the Nazirite, as it is said, <italic>Cut off &#x2018;nizreich&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thy hair</italic>) <italic>and cast it away</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2583">79</xref></sup> This then is the sense of [the expression here] <italic>the grapes of &#x2018;n&#x2019;zirecha,&#x2019;</italic> the general purport thereof being that they are the grapes which grow without cultivation of the vineyard. Thus Scripture is stating that that which grows by itself in the field he may not reap, and the grapes which grow in the vineyard without work he may not gather. And the meaning of these negative commandments is that you may not reap them alone for your own needs, nor are you to gather the grapes for yourself [only], but <italic>it shall be a year of solemn rest for the Land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2584">80</xref></sup> from sowing and pruning, <italic>and the Sabbath-produce of the Land</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2585">81</xref></sup> that is, whatever the Land brings forth in its rest, whether <italic>s&#x2019;fiach</italic> or <italic>nazir</italic> [as explained above] <italic>shall be unto</italic> all of <italic>you</italic> together <italic>for food, for thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2585">81</xref></sup> and for thy poor, and for the beast and for the cattle.<sup><xref rid="fn2586">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now I will return to explain the Beraithoth taught in the Torath Kohanim on this subject, because they are misleading [in their plain sense]. On the verse, <italic>And if ye shall say: &#x2018;What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we may not sow, nor gather in our increase</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2587">83</xref></sup> the Rabbis taught there [in the Torath Kohanim]:<sup><xref rid="fn2588">84</xref></sup> &#x201C;If people do not sow, what is there to gather? [So why then did Scripture prohibit gathering the increase, since there can be none to gather without sowing?] Said Rabbi Akiba: It is from here that the Sages found a Scriptural source for <italic>s&#x2019;fichin</italic> (aftergrowths), [indicating] that they are forbidden in the Sabbatical year.&#x201D; This Beraitha is quoted in the Gemara [of Tractate Pesachim] in the Chapter <italic>Makom Shenahagu</italic> (&#x201C;<italic>A place where the custom is&#x201D;</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2589">85</xref></sup> And it is further taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn2588">84</xref></sup> &#x201C;But the Sages say: Aftergrowths are not forbidden by law of the Torah, but only by decree of the Scribes. If so, why is it said, <italic>behold, we may not sow, nor gather?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2587">83</xref></sup> [It means as follows:] You have told us not to sow, and what there is for us to gather &#x2014; [the aftergrowths] &#x2014; we may not bring in for storage [after the time of the Removal];<sup><xref rid="fn2590">86</xref></sup> and then You have told us, &#x2018;Remove it [from the house],&#x2019; what then shall we eat from the time of the Removal onwards?&#x201D; Thus far [are the words of the Torath Kohanim].</p>
<p>Thus it is clear that according to the words of the Sages the prohibition of aftergrowths is only by law of the Rabbis, that is to say, it is they who decreed that they be prohibited altogether, because of the suspicion that the owners might sow and say that these are aftergrowths. It is for this reason that the Rabbis have said in the Yerushalmi:<sup><xref rid="fn2591">87</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Yannai said: All aftergrowths are forbidden [under the law forbidding theft, i.e., since they belong to the owner of the field, they may not be taken by a stranger during the non-Sabbatical years], except for those which come up in an uncultivated field, a plowed field, a field containing a vineyard, or a field sowed [with fenugreek]. [The aftergrowths of] an uncultivated field [are permissible to a stranger] because the owner pays no attention to such a field [and therefore it is considered ownerless]. A plowed field &#x2014; the owner desires to clear of all growths. A field containing a vineyard &#x2014; the owner does not want to forfeit his vineyard<sup><xref rid="fn2592">88</xref></sup> [because the aftergrowths of the grain in the vineyard constitute diverse kinds which are forbidden, and so he welcomes their being taken out by anyone]. A field sowed [with fenugreek] &#x2014; the owner does not want to maintain aftergrowths therein [because they harm the fenugreek].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2593">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is on the basis of this division of opinion [between Rabbi Akiba, who says that aftergrowths are forbidden in the Sabbatical year by law of the Torah, and the Sages, who are of the opinion that they are forbidden only by Rabbinical decree], that it is taught there in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn2594">90</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap</italic>. It is from here that they found a Scriptural source for forbidding aftergrowths in the Sabbatical year.&#x201D; They thus gave their teaching in accordance with the words of Rabbi Akiba, [who explains the phrase] <italic>thou shalt not reap</italic> as [prohibiting] altogether [any reaping, even of aftergrowths, by law of the Torah], But according to the words of the Sages [the verse means] that you are not to reap them [solely] for yourself, nor are you to gather the grapes [of your undressed vine solely] for yourself, but you are to treat them as if they were ownerless property. Similarly, <italic>and we do not gather in our increase</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2587">83</xref></sup> means that we do not gather [entirely] into our homes the fruits of the tree [which grow by themselves] nor the aftergrowths [of crops], because we must declare them ownerless for the poor, the beasts and the cattle, and at the time of Removal,<sup><xref rid="fn2590">86</xref></sup> [and therefore one might say that] we are not able to live on them [since we cannot use them entirely as our own possession.]&#x0021;</p>
<p>Now these aftergrowths which are forbidden according to Rabbi Akiba are those which have grown in the forbidden season. [i.e., the Sabbatical year]: in grain, all that has reached a third of its growth in the Sabbatical year, and in the case of vegetables, whatever has sprouted in the Sabbatical year are forbidden by law of the Torah. But according to the Sages they are forbidden by decree of the Scribes, except for those [aftergrowths] which come up in any of those [four kinds of] fields mentioned in the Yerushalmi<sup><xref rid="fn2591">87</xref></sup> which we have quoted above. However, vegetables that sprouted in the sixth year but were harvested in the seventh, are also subject to all the laws of the sanctity of the Sabbatical year [regarding Seventh year produce, which are as follows]: they must not be wasted [as they were given for food;<sup><xref rid="fn2585">81</xref></sup> their money substitute may not be used] for [obligatory] offerings;<sup><xref rid="fn2595">91</xref></sup> [they may not be used] for the purpose of trade, and they are subject to the law of Removal.<sup><xref rid="fn2590">86</xref></sup> For even though these vegetables grew completely in the sixth year [nonetheless if they were harvested in the seventh year, they are subject to the laws of the Sabbatical year], because we follow in the case of vegetables the time of collecting them in, whether for tithes<sup><xref rid="fn2596">92</xref></sup> or for the Sabbatical year. But the law of aftergrowths does not apply to them, for they are not aftergrowths of the Sabbatical year since they grew in the sixth year, and even if they continued [their growth] in the seventh year, the law of aftergrowths does not apply to them. It is with reference to such vegetables that we were taught [in the Mishnah]:<sup><xref rid="fn2597">93</xref></sup> &#x201C;If a man said to a laborer [in the Sabbatical year], &#x2018;Here you have an <italic>issar</italic> [a coin equivalent to one twenty-fourth of the silver <italic>dinar</italic>], and gather me vegetables today&#x2019;, his payment is permitted etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2598">94</xref></sup> And similarly we were taught [there] in a Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn2599">95</xref></sup> &#x201C;A man may not gather in the [wild] vegetables in a field and sell them in the market; but he may gather them in and his son may sell them for him;&#x201D; and we were also taught there:<sup><xref rid="fn2600">96</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rue, goosefoot, etc. may be bought from anyone in the Sabbatical year, since no watch is kept over the like of these&#x201D; [wild vegetables, and, since they are ownerless, the sanctity of the Sabbatical year does not apply to them].</p>
<p>Now some [scholars] say<sup><xref rid="fn2601">97</xref></sup> that [in the case of] these vegetables mentioned [in the above Mishnah] and all similar ones, which people do not usually sow, but which grow by themselves on mountains and near rivers, the prohibition of aftergrowths does not apply to them at all even though they grew in the Sabbatical year, since the Rabbis only forbade [the aftergrowths of] those things which are normally planted, in order that one should not plant them [in the Sabbatical year and then say that they grew by themselves]. And so it appears from the Gemara of the Yerushalmi [mentioned above]. This is the subject of &#x201C;aftergrowths&#x201D; whenever the Sages mention it [in the Talmud].</p>
<p>Similarly it is [forbidden by law] of the Torah for a person to guard his field and lock it up from the poor in the Sabbatical year, even if he intends to declare them free for all at the time of gathering them in; instead, the field is to be ready and free for the poor throughout the year. Thus the Sages taught in the Mechilta:<sup><xref rid="fn2602">98</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>That the poor of thy people may eat</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2603">99</xref></sup> &#x2018;Why did the Torah say this? Was it not so that the poor may eat it? If so, I am going to gather in the fruit and distribute it among the poor&#x2019;. Therefore Scripture states, <italic>But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2603">99</xref></sup> This teaches that the owner is even [obliged] to make breaches in the fence [so that everyone may come and take]. The Sages, however, as a precaution for the general good, allowed him to keep the fence.&#x201D; Now the restraining measure which the Sages established was only that he need not make breaches in the fences of his field and vineyard, but not that he may guard his field and gather in the fruits, thereby transgressing the words of the Torah. Moreover, the Sages even decreed against buying fruits which have been guarded, or even from one who is under suspicion of so [guarding]. It is with reference to this that we have been taught in the Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn2600">96</xref></sup> &#x201C;[The wild vegetables mentioned] may be bought from anyone in the Sabbatical year, since no watch is kept over the like of these.&#x201D; And in Tractate Succah the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2604">100</xref></sup> &#x201C;One may not hand over to those ignorant of the law more of the monetary equivalent of fruits of the Sabbatical year than that needed for three meals.<sup><xref rid="fn2605">101</xref></sup> This applies only where he buys [the fruits] from a field which was free for all,<sup><xref rid="fn2606">102</xref></sup> but if he buys from a guarded field, even the value of half an <italic>issar</italic> is forbidden.&#x201D; And the reason for this is as follows: When the purchaser buys it from a field which was free for all &#x2014; that is to say, from things which people usually bring from ownerless property, or if it is known that he brought them from a place which was declared free for all &#x2014; then [the purchaser who knows and observes the law] is permitted to buy the fruit. However, if he gives the owner more money than is needed for his [three] meals on that day, we suspect that the [seller who is] ignorant of the law might use [this money] for the purpose of business [which he is forbidden to do]. But if he buys things which it is customary to guard, then even if it is [no more than the value of] half an <italic>issar</italic>, we suspect that [the seller, being ignorant of the law], guarded them, in which case it is forbidden to buy from him. However if he buys a <italic>perutah&#x2019;s</italic> worth of fruits, or less than half an <italic>issar</italic>, the Sages did not prohibit this, because it is customary for people to gather them in from any [unguarded] place, even during the other years of the Sabbatical cycle.</p>
<p>It is referring to this that the Sages have taught:<sup><xref rid="fn2607">103</xref></sup> &#x201C;If a non-Jew was selling fruits in the market, and he said [by way of praising his products], &#x2018;These fruits are <italic>orlah</italic> [of the first three years&#x2019; growth, and are therefore better than the fruit of an old tree], or &#x2018;they are of <italic>azeikah</italic>&#x2019; [a term explained further on], he has said nought [i.e., we do not believe his statement that the fruits are <italic>orlah</italic> etc., and hence forbidden; instead we say that these fruits come from the majority of trees which are nor <italic>orlah</italic>, and they therefore may be eaten]. For the seller only intended to praise his products.&#x201D; Now Rashi explained there in the name of the early scholars,<sup><xref rid="fn2608">104</xref></sup> [that the term <italic>azeikah</italic> means that the fruits come] from an orchard &#x201C;that is enclosed&#x201D; with a fence around it, and it happens to be the Sabbatical year. Now if we were to believe him [the non-Jewish seller], it would be forbidden to buy the fruits from him in a city wherein most [of the inhabitants] are Jews, lest he is a tenant-laborer of a Jew and guards the field for him; or we would suspect that he may have gathered [these fruits] from a field belonging to a Jew [who has not declared them free for all] and he sells them; or that the fruits belong to a Jew and he is selling them for him. Or perhaps [even if the land belongs to the seller], a gentile cannot make such an acquisition in the Land of Israel as to negate the laws of the Sabbatical year [from his produce]. The Rabbis therefore decreed that the fruits of his field are to be regarded as those of an Israelite [and hence subject to all the laws of the Sabbatical year]. Nonetheless, the Sages did not prohibit the fruits of a guarded field [in the Sabbatical year] to everybody, but only [decreed] that one should not buy them directly from the owner who guarded them [but it is not the fruits themselves of a guarded field which are prohibited; thus if they have already been sold to a first purchaser, another Jew may buy them from him]. Therefore the Rabbis taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn2609">105</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather</italic>. From that which was guarded when in the land you are not to gather, but you may gather from that which was free for all. <italic>Thou shalt not gather</italic>, in the [ordinary] manner of those who gather grapes. It was on the basis of this that the Sages said: &#x2018;Seventh-year figs may not be cut with a special fig-knife [but may be cut with an ordinary knife]; grapes may not be pressed in a wine-press, but one may press them in a vat.&#x2019; &#x201D; And the meaning thereof is as follows: Since it is not written &#x201C;the grapes of the undressed vine thou shalt not reap,&#x201D; but instead it is written <italic>&#x2018;thy&#x2019; undressed vine</italic>, it is to be interpreted that you are not to gather them in the way you usually gather your grapes, but you may gather them together with the poor in the way that they gather them, meaning to say that he is not to guard them for himself, but he is to gather them with the poor as if they were ownerless. Similarly he is to treat them [after he has gathered them in] as the poor do, and press them in a vat. And it is further taught there [in the Torath Kohanim]:<sup><xref rid="fn2610">106</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And the Sabbath-produce of the Land shall be for food for you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2611">107</xref></sup> You are to eat from that which rested in the land [as will be explained], but you may not eat from that which was guarded. Hence the dictum of the Sages:<sup><xref rid="fn2612">108</xref></sup> The School of Shammai say, one may not eat from the produce of a field which has been industriously tilled.<sup><xref rid="fn2613">109</xref></sup> But the School of Hillel say that one may eat of it.&#x2019; &#x201D; That is to say, since the Torah stated that the produce of the Sabbath should be for us for food, and not that which was guarded, the School of Shammai say that the fruits themselves become prohibited [and therefore the produce of a field which was tilled twice, and considered as a field that was guarded, may not be eaten]; but the School of Hillel are of the opinion that the fruits themselves are not prohibited, for Scripture&#x2019;s intention is only to forbid us to guard [our produce], in order that our crops should be from a field in which the Sabbatical rest was observed. Similarly when the Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn2614">110</xref></sup> that seventh-year figs may not be cut with a [special] fig-knife, and grapes may not be pressed in a wine-press, [these laws are] a &#x201C;fence&#x201D; and guard of Rabbinic origin, in order that people should not come to guard and gather in their crops, and rob them from the poor. This is [the meaning of] that which is taught here in these Beraithoth [of the Torath Kohanim], and it is the best and clearest exposition of the discussions in the Babylonian and Jerusalem Gemara. The scholar who is acquainted [with the Talmud] will succeed in finding these texts.</p>
<p>6. AND &#x2018;SHABBATH HA&#x2019;ARETZ&#x2019; (THE SABBATH-PRODUCE OF THE LAND) SHALL BE FOR FOOD FOR YOU. Because He said <italic>it shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the Land</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2615">111</xref></sup> He states [here] that the rest mentioned <italic>shall be for food for you</italic> to maintain all of you &#x2014; you and your servant, and the cattle and the beast &#x2014; so that you should all support yourselves from that which the land will bring forth by itself whilst it is resting. Or [it may be that] the year itself is called <italic>shabbath ha&#x2019;aretz</italic>, just as the [seventh] day is called &#x201C;the Sabbath of the Eternal,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2616">112</xref></sup> or just &#x201C;Sabbath;&#x201D; and the reference thereof is to the produce of the Sabbath [year], for the Sabbath [year] itself is not something to be eaten.</p>
<p>7. AND FOR THY CATTLE, AND FOR THE BEASTS THAT ARE IN THY LAND, SHALL ALL THE INCREASE THEREOF BE FOR FOOD. &#x201C;If wild beasts may eat thereof, how much more so is this the case with cattle which it is your duty to feed&#x0021; Why then does it say <italic>and for thy cattle</italic>? [Scripture mentioned it] in order to liken cattle to the beast. As long as the wild beast is able to eat of [the produce of] the field, you may feed your cattle with that [which is stored] in the house; when food has disappeared for the wild beast in the field, remove it [what is stored] for your cattle from the house [and make it available to all animals alike].&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, taken from the Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn2617">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Rabbi [Rashi] did not, however, explain [the meaning of] this Removal. Its purport is that after a certain time the owner must remove all produce from his house and declare it ownerless [i.e., after food has disappeared for the wild beast from the field], this being &#x201C;the Removal of the Seventh-year [produce]&#x201D; which the Sages mention everywhere. Now the intention thereof is not that after the time of Removal it is forbidden for him to derive benefit from the produce or to eat, and that the owner must destroy it, for the Sages have not listed the fruits of the Seventh year in the Mishnah<sup><xref rid="fn2618">114</xref></sup> among those things that must be burnt, nor among those that must be buried. Rather, [the meaning of the Removal] is only that he must remove them from his control, and declare them free for the poor and for all people, similar to that which it says, <italic>I have put away the hallowed things out of my house</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2619">115</xref></sup> [in which case it obviously does not mean that he destroys <italic>the hallowed things</italic>, but rather that he gives them to whomever they belong, e.g. the heave-offering to the priest, etc.]. And so we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn2620">116</xref></sup> &#x201C;The poor may eat [of the produce] after the Removal, but not the rich. These are the words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Yosei says: Both the poor and the rich may eat of the produce after the Removal.&#x201D; The meaning of the term &#x201C;the poor&#x201D; is all people who gather the produce of fields of other people which have been declared ownerless, and &#x201C;the rich&#x201D; means the owners of the fields themselves, who gathered the produce of their own fields after they declared them free for all. Now Rabbi Yehudah declared that they [these &#x201C;rich&#x201D; former owners] are forbidden by law of the Rabbis to gather in from their own fields, on account of suspicion [that they did not really intend to make their fields free for all], but Rabbi Yosei permitted them [to gather in from their own fields], and the final decision of the law is according to his words. This Mishnah is also found in the Torah Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn2621">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>And in the Tosephta it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn2622">118</xref></sup> &#x201C;Originally messengers of the court would go around the entrances of the cities; if anyone had brought the produce [of the Seventh year] into his possession, they would take it from him and give him enough food for three meals, and the rest they would put into a store-house in the city. When the time of [the ripening of] figs came, the court&#x2019;s messengers would hire workers to pick them, and they would make them into cakes of pressed figs [and then put them into the store-house in the city]. When the time [of the ripening] of olives came, the court&#x2019;s messengers would hire workers to harvest them, press them in olive-presses and put [the oil] into barrels, and then they would put them into the store-house in the city. When the time of [the ripening of] grapes came, the court&#x2019;s messengers would hire workers to gather them, press them in a wine-press and put [the wine] into barrels, and they would put them into the store-house in the city. On the day preceding the [weekly] Sabbath they would distribute the food from them [the store-houses] to each and every one according to the needs of his family. When the time of the Removal arrived, the poor would eat after the Removal, but not the rich. These are the words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Yosei says: Both poor and rich may eat after the Removal. Rabbi Shimon says: The rich may eat from the store-house after the Removal.<sup><xref rid="fn2623">119</xref></sup> [When the time of the Removal came] he who had produce to distribute gave it to the poor. If someone had produce of the Seventh year [and he lived in a place where there was no store-house, nor a functioning court to supervise the distribution], and the time of Removal was come, he would distribute some of it to his neighbors, relatives and friends, and [the remainder] he would take out and place at the door of his house, and say: &#x2018;Brethren, house of Israel&#x0021; Whoever has to take, let him come and take&#x0021;&#x2019; And then he may bring [the rest] back into his house and continue to eat of it until it is finished.&#x201D;</p>
<p>All this is taught in the Tosephta, and from it we clearly learn that the term &#x201C;Removal&#x201D; only means that [the Seventh-year produce] must be taken out of the owner&#x2019;s possession, and that he must declare it free for all, and that [for the fulfillment of this law] the Rabbis made various ordinances. Originally the court used to make a store-house in each and every city. As soon as the fruits ripened, they would take them from those who brought them [from their fields] and put them into the store-house. Thus when the time of the harvest for the whole of that crop would arrive, such as when the time had come for reaping the grain or gathering the grapes, the [messengers of the] court would hire workers to gather the grapes, pick the olives and harvest the whole of that species, and then they would press the grapes in a wine-press and the olives in an olive-press as one does during any other year, and put them into their store-house. Now this produce which was gathered into the store-house of the court required no other act of &#x201C;Removal,&#x201D; since they were already removed from the homes [of their owners], and both poor and rich were permitted after the time of the Removal to come and receive them from the court&#x2019;s messengers, and to eat them. All this ordinance and trouble taken by the court was on account of suspicion, that [if the court were not to act in this manner] people would hold on to it [the produce of the Seventh year] or do business with it. And where there was no store-house in the city, nor a [functioning] court, and the produce remained in the hands of he who gathered it in from ownerless property, then he must remove it from his house when the time of Removal comes, and declare it free for all at the door of his house, and from then on he is permitted to continue eating from it [as long as it lasts]. This is [what the Rabbis meant in saying<sup><xref rid="fn2624">120</xref></sup> that] Seventh-year produce renders forbidden [a mixture] of its own kind in the smallest of quantities as far as the Removal is concerned,<sup><xref rid="fn2625">121</xref></sup> as is mentioned in Tractate Nedarim,<sup><xref rid="fn2624">120</xref></sup> because it may be rendered permissible by removal from his house.</p>
<p>Now I have found the following comment of Rashi which he wrote in Tractate Pesachim:<sup><xref rid="fn2626">122</xref></sup> &#x201C;And it is this which constitutes their &#x2018;removal&#x2019; &#x2014; that he is to make them free for all in a place where human beings and animals tread.&#x201D; Perhaps the Rabbi thought that the owner has to make it free also for beasts and cattle, in order to fulfill that which is written concerning them, <italic>that the poor of thy people may eat</italic>, [<italic>and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat</italic>];<sup><xref rid="fn2627">123</xref></sup> <italic>and for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy Land</italic> [<italic>shall all the increase thereof be for food</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2628">124</xref></sup> In this he [Rashi] has stated the matter too strongly, for [as we explain it] eating of the produce [after the Removal] is not prohibited at all. And the Rabbis have already taught in the Tosephta that the Removal of the [produce of the] Seventh year is like the removal [mentioned] in connection with the Second Tithe<sup><xref rid="fn2619">115</xref></sup>, and there is no difference between them as far as prohibition of eating them [for just as the Second Tithe is eaten, so the Seventh-year produce may be eaten].</p>
<p>Now Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon]<sup><xref rid="fn2629">125</xref></sup> and many of the Sages<sup><xref rid="fn2630">126</xref></sup> are, however, of the opinion that the Removal renders the produce completely forbidden, and it must be burnt, or spread about and scattered in the wind, or thrown into the sea. But it is not so, as has been explained. If, however, he retained it in his home after the [time for the] Removal so that he may eat thereof, then it does become completely forbidden as food. This is the Seventh-year produce which renders [a mixture of a <italic>different</italic> kind] forbidden, [but only] if it is enough to give [the entire mixture] its flavor, since it has no permitted status [after the Removal; and therefore if the Seventh-year produce is not enough to give its flavor into the entire mixture, it becomes &#x201C;annulled&#x201D; by the majority of permitted food, but if it is enough to give it its flavor, it is not annulled].<sup><xref rid="fn2631">127</xref></sup> It is possible that this prohibition is [only] by law of the Rabbis; perhaps even the whole matter of Removal is a stringency imposed by the Scribes, and the Beraithoth taught in the Torath Kohanim on the subject of Removal are only Scriptural supports for a matter which is of Rabbinic origin.</p>
<p>On this basis the following Mishnah can be well-explained:<sup><xref rid="fn2632">128</xref></sup> &#x201C;If one pickles three kinds of vegetables [of Seventh-year produce] in a single barrel etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2633">129</xref></sup> Similarly [we may well understand] the following Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn2634">130</xref></sup> &#x201C;Three countries are to be distinguished as regards the Seventh year.&#x201D; There we are taught: &#x201C;Throughout that part of the Land of Israel which those that came up from Babylon occupied, as far as Chezib,<sup><xref rid="fn2635">131</xref></sup> [Seventh-year produce] may not be eaten [without Removal], and [the land] may not be cultivated. Throughout that part of the Land which those that came up from Egypt occupied [but which was not later occupied by those that came up from the Babylonian captivity], from Chezib<sup><xref rid="fn2634">130</xref></sup> to the river<sup><xref rid="fn2636">132</xref></sup> and [from Chezib] to Amanah,<sup><xref rid="fn2637">133</xref></sup> [Seventh-year produce] may be eaten [without Removal], but [the land] may not be cultivated.&#x201D; Thus the Sages were more lenient as regards eating [the Seventh-year produce] after the time of Removal [without having gone through the actual act of Removal] than they were as regards cultivating [the land].<sup><xref rid="fn2638">134</xref></sup> And in the Yerushalmi it is mentioned:<sup><xref rid="fn2639">135</xref></sup> &#x201C;A certain person who was suspected of [breaking the law of] Seventh-year produce said to his wife, &#x2018;Separate the dough-offering [from the dough].&#x2019; Thereupon she said to him, &#x2018;That person [i.e., you] is suspected of breaking the law of Seventh-year produce, and he tells me to separate the dough-offering&#x0021;&#x2019; He said to her, &#x2018;The dough-offering is a matter of Scriptural law; the law of the Seventh-year produce was ordained by the Rabbis, Rabban Gamaliel and his colleagues.&#x2019; &#x201D; That unworthy man was suspected of retaining produce of the Seventh year and eating it after the [time of] Removal, and he said that the prohibition of eating <italic>tevel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2640">136</xref></sup> is a law of the Torah, but the Removal and the prohibition of eating Seventh-year produce after the Removal was ordained by Rabban Gamaliel and his colleagues. Or it may be that [he meant that although] the Removal itself is by law of the Torah, the prohibition of eating from the produce after the [time of] Removal [if one did not fulfill the law of Removal] is by law of the Rabbis &#x2014; and he was only particular not to eat that which is forbidden by the Torah. Now since the Sages have mentioned the words of this person, it would seem that they are correct [inasmuch as that the prohibition against eating produce after the Removal, was enacted only by the Rabbis, as explained above]. Or perhaps [this is no indication that such is the accepted opinion of the law, because it may be] that this wicked person relied upon the [unaccepted] opinion of Rabbi Shimon<sup><xref rid="fn2641">137</xref></sup> who says: &#x201C;Scripture speaks of two kinds of release [the release of land and the release of money],&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2642">138</xref></sup> and the law of the Seventh-year nowadays is of Rabbinic authority, although the law of removing the dough-offering [in the Land of Israel] is of the Torah.</p>
<p>9. THEN SHALT THOU MAKE PROCLAMATION WITH THE BLAST OF THE HORN ON THE TENTH DAY OF THE SEVENTH MONTH; IN THE DAY OF ATONEMENT SHALL YE MAKE PROCLAMATION WITH THE HORN THROUGHOUT ALL YOUR LAND. &#x201C;Since Scripture states <italic>in the Day of Atonement</italic> do I not know that it is <italic>on the tenth day of the seventh month?</italic> Why then does Scripture state <italic>on the tenth day?</italic> [It is to teach us that] the blowing [of the <italic>Shofar</italic>] on the tenth day of the seventh month overrides the Sabbath <italic>throughout all your Land</italic>, but the blowing [of the <italic>Shofar</italic>] on the New Year does not override the Sabbath <italic>throughout all your Land</italic>, but only at the court alone.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>Now the Rabbi [Rashi], with his expert knowledge of the Talmud, and because it is all for him like a ready-laid table, was not concerned when he quoted Beraithoth without qualification, but they are misleading for the rest of the people [who are not as expert in the Talmud as he was]. For it is known and clear in the Gemara<sup><xref rid="fn2643">139</xref></sup> that all blowings of the <italic>Shofar</italic>, whether on the New Year, or the Day of Atonement [in the Jubilee year], or even [blowing] out of one&#x2019;s own desire [without any intention to fulfill a commandment], are permitted on the Sabbath [by law of the Torah], since blowing [of the <italic>Shofar</italic>] is merely an art and not &#x201C;work.&#x201D; They used [in fact] to blow the <italic>Shofar everywhere</italic> by law of the Torah on the Sabbath of the New Year and on the Day of Atonement; and the matter of blowing the <italic>Shofar</italic> [only] at the court, was ordained by Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai<sup><xref rid="fn2644">140</xref></sup> after the Temple was destroyed. This was decreed [by Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai], because they [the Sages] prohibited the blowing of the <italic>Shofar</italic> [if the New Year fell on a Sabbath]. Since everyone is obliged to blow the <italic>Shofar</italic> [or to hear it blown, but not everyone is expert in it, thus we fear that] perhaps he will take the <italic>Shofar</italic> in his hand and go to an expert to learn, and thus he will carry it the distance of four cubits in a public thoroughfare [which is forbidden by law of the Torah on the Sabbath]; and Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai therefore only permitted us to do it at the court [where the fear of the judges ensures that nobody will violate the Sabbath on account of the blowing of the <italic>Shofar</italic>]. There is thus no basis whatsoever for this prohibition in Scripture [and so how could Rashi interpret the verse before us on the basis of this Rabbinic enactment]? And the Rabbis, in mentioning that &#x201C;the blowing of the <italic>Shofar</italic> on the tenth day [of the seventh month] overrides the Sabbath,&#x201D; intended to say that it is done on every Day of Atonement [in the Jubilee year, whether it falls on a weekday or on the Sabbath]; for there is no difference between overriding the Day of Atonement when it falls on the Sabbath or when it falls on a weekday, since the Day of Atonement itself is like the Sabbath in respect of [the prohibition of] all work, whether that of carrying [an object four cubits in a public thoroughfare, or transferring it from &#x201C;public&#x201D; to &#x201C;private&#x201D; ground and vice versa], or any other kind of [forbidden] work.<sup><xref rid="fn2645">141</xref></sup> Even so, the Rabbi [Rashi] wished to teach us that the blowing of the <italic>Shofar</italic> on the Day of Atonement is to be done in all places, for the meaning of the expression <italic>ye shall make proclamation with the horn throughout all your Land</italic> is to teach us that each individual is obliged to blow [or hear the sound of] the <italic>Shofar</italic>, and that the blowing is not done only at the court, as is the counting [of the years].<sup><xref rid="fn2646">142</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. &#x2018;YOVEIL HI&#x2019; (IT IS A JUBILEE). &#x201C;This [the fiftieth] year is distinguished from all other years by being given a special name. And what is that name? Its name is <italic>yoveil</italic> [literally: &#x2018;the ram&#x2019;s horn&#x2019;] on account of the blowing of the <italic>Shofar</italic>.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, and such also is the opinion of the commentators<sup><xref rid="fn2647">143</xref></sup> that [the word <italic>yoveil</italic> here] is of the roots: <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;keren hayoveil&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>with the ram&#x2019;s horn</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn2648">144</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;shofroth ha&#x2019;yovlim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the rams&#x2019; horns</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2649">145</xref></sup> But I do not find this acceptable, because of [the expression here] <italic>shall be unto you</italic> [<italic>it shall be a Jubilee unto you</italic>]<italic>;</italic> for what sense is there in saying of a year that &#x201C;it shall be &#x2018;a blowing&#x2019; unto you&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2650">146</xref></sup> <italic>and you shall return</italic> [<italic>every man unto his possession</italic> etc.]? Perhaps Scripture is stating: &#x201C;<italic>It is a Jubilee</italic> distinguishable by that name which I have called it, <italic>and it shall be unto</italic> all of <italic>you</italic> known by the blowing of the <italic>Shofar</italic> which you will do thereon, reminding you of the purport [of the Jubilee year], that in it <italic>every man shall return unto his possession, and every man unto his family</italic>.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>A Jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2651">147</xref></sup> means that it shall be a Jubilee unto you, that <italic>ye shall not sow, neither reap</italic>, that is to say, it is known by its name that it is to be so.</p>
<p>But all this appears to me to be incorrect. For the meaning of <italic>shofroth ha&#x2019;yovlim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2649">145</xref></sup> is &#x201C;the horns of the rams,&#x201D; and Yonathan [ben Uziel] also translated there: &#x201C;<italic>shofroth</italic> [made] of rams&#x2019; horns.&#x201D; It is also so stated in the Gemara:<sup><xref rid="fn2652">148</xref></sup> &#x201C;What intimation is there that the term <italic>yoveil</italic> is an expression for a ram? In Arabic they call a ram <italic>yovlo</italic>.&#x201D; Now the <italic>Shofar</italic> used on the Day of Atonement [in the Jubilee year] does not necessarily need to be a ram&#x2019;s horn, for all <italic>shofroth</italic> (horns) are valid on it, and in the opinion of our Mishnah<sup><xref rid="fn2653">149</xref></sup> and all the Tannaim (Sages of the Mishnah), the commandment is [preferably to be performed in the year of the Jubilee] with the horn of wild goats. If so, why then would the [Jubilee] year be called &#x201C;the year of the ram?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that the meaning of <italic>yoveil</italic> is like &#x201C;sending forth.&#x201D; In my opinion, Scripture does not call the year <italic>yoveil</italic> with reference to the blowing [of the <italic>Shofar</italic>], but with reference to &#x201C;the liberty&#x201D; [that it brings to the inhabitants of the Land]; for this term is not mentioned in the first verse which states, <italic>Then shalt thou make proclamation with the blast of the horn</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2654">150</xref></sup> But when He stated [in the verse before us] <italic>and ye shall proclaim liberty throughout the Land unto all the inhabitants thereof</italic>, meaning that they shall all be free to reside wherever they please, He continued by saying <italic>&#x2018;yoveil hi,&#x2019;</italic> that it is a year in which every man is &#x201C;carried away&#x201D; to his possession, and his feet &#x201C;transport him&#x201D; to his family <italic>afar off to sojourn</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2655">151</xref></sup> This term [<italic>yoveil</italic>] is used in connection with many subjects. Thus: <italic>&#x2018;yuval&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>there shall be brought</italic>) <italic>a present unto the Eternal of hosts</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2656">152</xref></sup> and it is further stated: <italic>and on &#x2018;yuval&#x2019; it spreadeth out its roots;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2657">153</xref></sup> <italic>streams and &#x2018;yivlei mayim&#x2019;</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2658">154</xref></sup> which mean &#x201C;channels through which water is conveyed.&#x201D; <italic>And the Land shall yield &#x2018;yevulah&#x2019;;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2659">155</xref></sup> and <italic>neither shall &#x2018;yevul&#x2019; be in the vines</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2660">156</xref></sup> also signify a kind of &#x201C;bringing&#x201D; [of produce or fruits], just as they are called <italic>t&#x2019;vuah</italic> [&#x201C;produce,&#x201D; which is of the root &#x201C;bringing&#x201D;]. Similarly in Aramaic [as will be explained]. Thus: <italic>and carry it quickly</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2661">157</xref></sup> the Targum renders: &#x201C;<italic>v&#x2019;ovil</italic> quickly.&#x201D; Thus the meaning of <italic>it shall be &#x2018;yoveil&#x2019; unto you</italic> is &#x201C;it is a year which &#x2018;brings&#x2019; [liberty] and it shall be so to all of you, that you shall come <italic>and return every man unto his possession, and every man unto his family</italic>.&#x201D; And He stated again [in the following verse], <italic>A &#x2018;yoveil&#x2019; shall that fiftieth year be unto you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2651">147</xref></sup> meaning that the fiftieth year shall be to you only for <italic>yoveil</italic> [&#x201C;bringing&#x201D; liberty], and not for anything else, and <italic>ye shall not sow, neither reap</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2651">147</xref></sup> but instead it <italic>shall be holy</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2662">158</xref></sup> and <italic>every man shall return unto his possession</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2663">159</xref></sup> so that the year shall be for all of you a <italic>yoveil</italic> [bringing everyone back to his possession and family], as its name indicates.</p>
<p>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the term <italic>d&#x2019;ror</italic> (liberty) is related to the expression, <italic>&#x2018;dor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a generation</italic>) <italic>passeth away, &#x2018;v&#x2019;dor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and a generation</italic>) <italic>cometh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2664">160</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>yoveil</italic> means that everyone will return to the <italic>yoveil</italic> (source) whence his roots are, and this <italic>shall be unto you</italic>, [until that time].<sup><xref rid="fn2665">161</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. OUT OF THE FIELD YE SHALL EAT THE INCREASE THEREOF. &#x201C;By virtue of the produce to be found in the field, you may eat of what is in the house, but if it is no longer to be found by the beast in the field, you must remove it from the house, just as it is said in the case of the Sabbatical year.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But if so, the verse is not well-connected [to the preceding part].<sup><xref rid="fn2666">162</xref></sup> Instead, Scripture is stating: <italic>Ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it &#x2026;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2651">147</xref></sup> <italic>For it is a Jubilee; it shall be holy unto you</italic>, and <italic>out of the field ye shall eat the increase thereof</italic>, and not out of the house. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted: &#x201C;<italic>out of the field ye shall eat</italic>, out of what the field brings forth of its own accord you shall all eat, as is written in the case of the Sabbatical year.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In my opinion Scripture is stating: &#x201C;<italic>You shall not reap nor gather</italic> in this year, <italic>for it is a Jubilee</italic> and <italic>it shall be holy unto you; out of the field you shall</italic> bring the produce and <italic>eat</italic>, meaning: that you are to go forth into the field to glean and eat together with the poor and destitute, the beast and cattle, and it is not to be for you a time of reaping and gathering in the produce, and bringing it into your house and store-houses like the produce of all other years.&#x201D; Now we are taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn2667">163</xref></sup> &#x201C;From this the Sages have inferred that if one preserves three kinds of vegetables in a single barrel, Rabbi Elazar<sup><xref rid="fn2668">164</xref></sup> says: &#x2018;They may be eaten only as long as the first [to ripen of the three kinds] remains in the field&#x2019; [but as soon as one vegetable is no longer found in the field, all three are forbidden to be eaten, since by preserving them together he makes all three as one]. Rabbi Yehoshua says: &#x2018;Even as long as the last [to ripen of the three kinds] remains in the field&#x2019; [they may all be eaten, although the first two vegetables are no longer to be found in the field]. Rabban Gamaliel says: &#x2018;When any one of the species comes to an end in the field, he is to remove that kind from the house&#x2019;. And the final decision of the law is according to him. Rabbi Shimon says: &#x2018;All vegetables are considered one with regard to the law of Removal.&#x2019; &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2669">165</xref></sup> All this interpretation is because Scripture does not say &#x201C;out of the field you shall bring and eat,&#x201D; but instead [said, <italic>out of the field ye shall eat</italic>, thus] placing &#x201C;the eating&#x201D; next to &#x201C;the field,&#x201D; meaning that one may eat [what is stored in the house] only because of it [that which is still to be found in the field]. It is possible that this matter<sup><xref rid="fn2670">166</xref></sup> is only a Scriptural support for a law of Rabbinic origin, and that is why Rabbi Yehoshua was lenient [even] about it [the actual vegetable], and Rabban Gamaliel [who was more stringent about it than Rabbi Yehoshua, also] was lenient about the taste [of the vegetable which remains in the other vegetables after it is taken out of the barrel]. I have already written on this subject above.<sup><xref rid="fn2671">167</xref></sup> It is possible that according to Rabban Gamaliel the commandment of Removal is by law of the Torah, but the taste of a vegetable, once it is absorbed [by other food] at the beginning [i.e., before the time of the Removal], is considered as if it were &#x201C;removed&#x201D; [since it is absorbed and has no independent existence].</p>
<p>14. YE SHALL NOT WRONG ONE ANOTHER. &#x201C;This refers to overcharging in money matters.&#x201D; 15. ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF YEARS AFTER THE JUBILEE THOU SHALT BUY OF THY NEIGHBOR. &#x201C;The plain meaning of the verse as indicated by its context is that Scripture is admonishing here against overcharging [as mentioned in the preceding verse, and explains here in detail]: When you sell or buy land, ascertain how many years there are left till the Jubilee, and according to these years the vendor is to sell and the purchaser to buy, for in the end the purchaser must return him [the land] in the year of the Jubilee. Thus if there are but a few years [till the Jubilee] and he sells it at a high price, the purchaser has been wronged, and if there are many years so that the purchaser can eat many crops from it, he must buy it according to the [greater] time [remaining till the Jubilee]. It is referring to this that it is said, <italic>according to the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2672">168</xref></sup> [meaning]: according to the number of years of crops which the land will remain in the hand of the purchaser, you shall sell it to him. Now our Rabbis have derived from here [the law] that one who sells his field has no right to redeem it before two years [after the date of the sale, for the verse states, <italic>according to the number of &#x2018;years&#x2019; of the crops he shall sell</italic>, and the minimum number of the term &#x2018;years&#x2019; is two], even if there were three crops in those two years. [However, although this interpretation of the Rabbis indicates that the verse in speaking of <italic>shnei</italic> means &#x2018;two years&#x2019;], it does not lose its literal meaning [i.e., &#x2018;years of&#x2019;], that is to say, he is to sell by the number of &#x2018;years of&#x2019; crops, and not by years when the produce is smitten by blast,<sup><xref rid="fn2673">169</xref></sup> and the minimum number implied in &#x2018;years&#x2019; is two.&#x201D; Thus far is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>Now this is indeed the correct interpretation of the verse; however, our Rabbis have said that overcharge does not apply in [the sale of] land, for it is said:<sup><xref rid="fn2674">170</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Or buy of thy neighbor&#x2019;s &#x2018;hand&#x2019;</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2675">171</xref></sup> and this refers to something which is transferred from &#x2018;hand&#x2019; to &#x2018;hand&#x2019; &#x201D; [i.e., movable goods or chattels]. But this verse according to the Rabbi [Rashi], both in its plain meaning and its [Rabbinical] interpretation, speaks of [overcharging in the sale of] land&#x0021; We must then perforce turn the verses away from their simple meaning, and say that each one stands independently [of the others].<sup><xref rid="fn2676">172</xref></sup> Thus Scripture is stating: <italic>And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy of thy neighbor&#x2019;s hand</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2675">171</xref></sup> that is, something which is transferred from hand to hand, <italic>ye shall not wrong one another</italic>. Then He states further: &#x201C;<italic>According to the number of years after the Jubilee thou shalt buy</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2672">168</xref></sup> of him the crops, <italic>and according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell</italic> them <italic>unto thee</italic>. According to the years you shall increase and reduce the price,<sup><xref rid="fn2677">173</xref></sup> for you will have to return it [i.e., the land] to him in the Jubilee.&#x201D; All this is an admonition regarding the Jubilee, that they should keep it forever [but it is not intended as a law against overcharging in the sale of land, for in such a transaction the law of overcharge does not apply]. Then He said further, <italic>And ye shall not wrong one another</italic>, [referring to wronging] by words [i.e., offending].</p>
<p>And it further seems to me logical that one who intentionally overcharges his fellowman, definitely transgresses a negative commandment, whether it be [in a sale of] chattels or land, for it is with reference to them that Scripture is saying, <italic>Ye shall not wrong one another. According to the number of years after the Jubilee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2678">174</xref></sup> admonishing that one must buy and sell according to the years [after the Jubilee], and that no man shall wrong another. But our Rabbis laid down a new law regarding overcharge, namely, that [if the amount overcharged was] one-sixth of the total purchase-price, [the sale is valid and that extra amount] must be paid back, but the sale is totally invalidated if the amount overcharged was more than one-sixth of the purchase-price. It is only from this law that land has been excluded, since [a person] foregoes an overcharge of even more than a sixth [of the purchase-price] in the case of [the sale of land], just as one [is prepared to] forego in the case of chattels an overcharge of less than a sixth [of the purchase-price], although it is forbidden intentionally to overcharge by such [amounts], but people do not usually go back on their purchase on account of such a small overcharging. The Sages interpreted [Scripture to give a basis for this law] because the verse states, <italic>And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy</italic> something which is transferred from hand to hand, <italic>ye shall not wrong one another</italic>. From this we learn that in the matter of overcharging there is a special law for chattels which does not apply to land, namely, the return of the money, [i.e., the cancellation of the entire sale if the amount overcharged was more than a sixth of the purchase-price], but the negative commandment [forbidding overcharging] applies to all transactions. That is why He said, <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;chi thim&#x2019;kru mimkar&#x2019;</italic> [&#x201C;if &#x2018;ye&#x2019; sell aught&#x201D;], which is a plural expression, referring to one who sells land and to one who sells chattels; <italic>&#x2018;o kanoh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>or buys</italic>) <italic>of thy neighbor&#x2019;s hand</italic>, referring to an individual, who sells chattels from hand to hand, and with reference to all of them He said <italic>ye shall not wrong</italic>. But since He singled out and specified chattels, [it indicates that] He gave concerning them an additional law regarding overcharging, namely the [right to] return the money [of the purchase-price and thereby cancel the sale]. This is a correct interpretation according to the expositions which our Rabbis have received on the allusions of the Torah.</p>
<p>Perhaps all this is only a Scriptural support [for a Rabbinical enactment], for the negative commandment [<italic>ye shall not wrong one another</italic>] constitutes an admonition applying to both land and chattels [but does not refer at all to cancellation of the entire purchase], and [the right to return] the money the Rabbis received by tradition as applying to chattels and not to [transactions of] land, just as they have said<sup><xref rid="fn2679">175</xref></sup> that [land] is a possession that is worth any price. For all these [differing] standards of one-sixth [of the purchase-price, in which case the sale is valid and the amount overcharged must be returned], and more than one-sixth [in which case the entire sale may be cancelled] are based on people&#x2019;s opinions [and since &#x201C;land is worth any price&#x201D; to most people, the Rabbis did not institute these laws of overcharging with respect to land]. And why should the Rabbis not exclude [transactions of] land from this law [of overcharging] just as they excluded from it wares bought from a householder. Thus they said:<sup><xref rid="fn2680">176</xref></sup> &#x201C;[The law of overcharging] is taught only if one buys from a merchant, but if one buys from a private householder, the law of overcharging does not apply,&#x201D; because private people are not in the habit of selling the possessions that they use [and hence if they do sell them, it is considered as if they had made a specific condition that the buyer cannot complain about the price].<sup><xref rid="fn2681">177</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also possible to say that Scripture is warning that they [sellers and purchasers] should take cognizance of the number of years till the Jubilee, and according to them they should sell and buy, and no one shall wrong another because of them by misleading him about the number [of years], or by deceiving him about the sale, so that he thinks that it is in perpetuity, and thus he leads him astray thereby. Instead, they must both know and inform one another of this number, since the sale is according to the number of years [remaining] until the Jubilee, for even in [transactions of] land the law of overcharging applies as regards size and number,<sup><xref rid="fn2682">178</xref></sup> even if the misleading referred to was less than one-sixth [of the size or the number], and all the more so in the case of chattels [one must be careful not to overcharge].</p>
<p>18. AND YE SHALL DO MY STATUTES, AND KEEP MINE ORDINANCES. He warned [here] concerning [all] the statutes on account of the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee mentioned [above], because these [commandments] are in the category of &#x201C;statutes&#x201D; [for which no explicit reason is given], and [He warned concerning all] the ordinances on account of the law of the return of sales and servants in the Jubilee, and [the law of] overcharging [which are &#x201C;ordinances&#x201D; for which the reasons are obvious]. He said, <italic>and ye shall dwell in the Land in safety</italic>, because it is for the sin of [transgressing the laws of] the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee that Israel goes into exile. He then said again, <italic>And the Land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat until ye have enough, and dwell therein in safety</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2683">179</xref></sup> meaning that you will not have to go out of the Land in the Sabbatical year in order to live in another land on account of lack of food [because <italic>the Land shall yield</italic> enough <italic>fruit</italic>].</p>
<p>20. AND IF YE SHALL SAY: &#x2018;WHAT SHALL WE EAT THE SEVENTH YEAR?&#x2019; The verse is, as it were, inverted, meaning: &#x201C;and if you shall say in the seventh year, &#x2018;What shall we eat [in the eighth year]?&#x2019; for their worry would be about the eighth year. For since the beginning of the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee is in Tishri, then they would eat of the produce of the sixth year during the seventh year, as is the normal way in all other years to eat [of the old produce] until after the reaping [of the new], which is at the time of the Festival of Weeks, and even afterwards until the work of fanning and sifting the produce is finished. Therefore the correct interpretation of the verse, <italic>and it shall bring forth produce for the three years</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2684">180</xref></sup> is that on account of the year of Jubilee [which always follows a Sabbatical year, G-d will command His blessing <italic>in the sixth year</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2684">180</xref></sup> meaning] that the sixth year will bring forth [sufficient produce] for the whole of the Sabbatical year, the Jubilee and the year after the Jubilee, and during all these [three years] they will eat of the old crop. Thus Scripture is assuring them that should they fear in the seventh year saying, &#x201C;What shall we eat?&#x201D; <italic>then I will command My blessing in the sixth year</italic> that it shall bring forth produce <italic>for the three years</italic> following after [the sixth year], this being an additional blessing [to that of every Sabbatical year, when the sixth year brings forth sufficient produce for the seventh and eighth years; and when in addition there is a Jubilee year, it will bring forth enough for three years] so that it should suffice also for the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee. He states, <italic>And ye shall sow the eighth year</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2685">181</xref></sup> meaning to say that you should sow in the eighth year in the customary manner of every year, and you should not hurry to plow and sow, or to reap, for <italic>until her produce come in</italic> into the house at the time that the harvest [usually] takes place every year, at the Festival of Tabernacles, <italic>ye shall eat the old crop</italic>. And in the Torath Kohanim [it is stated]:<sup><xref rid="fn2686">182</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>For the three years</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2684">180</xref></sup> &#x2014; for the sixth, the seventh, and the year after the seventh. Another interpretation: <italic>For the three years</italic> &#x2014; for the Seventh year, the Jubilee, and the year after the Jubilee.&#x201D;</p>
<p>23. AND THE LAND SHALL NOT BE SOLD IN PERPETUITY. &#x201C;This is to declare a negative commandment affecting [one who refuses] to return fields to their [original] owners in the Jubilee, so that the purchaser should not retain it.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But if so, why does He warn about &#x201C;selling&#x201D; [saying, <italic>the Land shall not be &#x2018;sold&#x2019; in perpetuity</italic>], when it should rather have said: &#x201C;Thou shalt not <italic>buy</italic> in perpetuity&#x201D;? Perhaps [the meaning of the verse is as if] it said, &#x201C;<italic>and the Land shall not be sold</italic> to you <italic>in perpetuity</italic>&#x201D; [and thus the prohibition refers to the buyer]. Similarly, <italic>they shall not be sold as bondmen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2687">183</xref></sup> is an admonition to the purchaser, that he must send forth to freedom [a Hebrew servant] in the Jubilee year, according to the plain meaning of the verse.</p>
<p>It is, [however], possible that <italic>the Land shall not be sold in perpetuity</italic> is a negative commandment referring to the seller, that he is not to sell it permanently by saying: &#x201C;I am selling it to you forever, even for after the Jubilee.&#x201D; For although the Jubilee [in fact] takes it out of his possession [despite his intention of buying it permanently], Scripture nonetheless admonishes the seller or both of them that they should not [attempt to] make their transaction in perpetuity, and if they did so stipulate, they transgress this negative commandment, and [additionally] it will be of no avail to them, for the land <italic>will</italic> return in the Jubilee. And so did Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon] explain it.<sup><xref rid="fn2688">184</xref></sup> And the reason for this prohibition [of stipulating a permanent sale, although such a stipulation is completely ineffective], is because it is well-known in human thought that if people take into account from the beginning of the transaction the number of years until the Jubilee, it will [in the end] be easier for them [i.e., for the purchasers, to return it in the Jubilee], but if one [intends to] buy it in perpetuity, one will find it very difficult to return. This prohibition, then, is similar to what the Sages have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2689">185</xref></sup> &#x201C;That which the Merciful One said one may not do, if one does do, has no legal effect, but the transgressor is liable to the punishment of whipping because he violated the Royal decree.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The correct opinion appears to me to be that this is not a negative commandment [for the transgression of which] one is liable to whipping. Rather, [the verse merely states] a reason [for the Jubilee], saying: &#x201C;Observe between you [the law of] the Jubilee, and be not resentful about it, <italic>for the Land is Mine</italic>, and I do not want that it should be sold in perpetuity as [in the case of] other transactions.&#x201D; This is the meaning [of the Rabbis&#x2019; interpretation] in the Torath Kohanim:<sup><xref rid="fn2690">186</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And the Land shall not be sold &#x2018;litzmithuth&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; permanently. <italic>For the Land is Mine</italic> &#x2014; [therefore] be not resentful about it. <italic>For ye are strangers and settlers</italic> &#x2014; do not consider yourselves the main [proprietors]. <italic>Ye are with Me</italic> &#x2014; it is enough for the servant to be as his Master. When it is Mine it is yours.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2691">187</xref></sup></p>
<p>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the meaning of the expression <italic>for the Land is Mine</italic> [literally: &#x201C;for &#x2018;unto Me&#x2019; is the Land&#x201D;] is like <italic>and they take &#x2018;unto Me&#x2019; an offering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2692">188</xref></sup> It is this which the Rabbis have alluded to here [by saying in the Torath Kohanim]:<sup><xref rid="fn2690">186</xref></sup> &#x201C;It is enough for the servant to be as his Master,&#x201D; for the Jubilee will be applying [even]<sup><xref rid="fn2693">189</xref></sup> in the world. The person learned [in the mysteries of the Cabala] will understand.</p>
<p>24. AND IN ALL THE LAND OF YOUR POSSESSION [YE SHALL GRANT A REDEMPTION FOR THE LAND]. &#x201C;This [expression of &#x2018;in all the land&#x2019;] includes houses and Hebrew servants [that they too be granted the right of redemption]. This matter is explained in the first chapter of Tractate Kiddushin.<sup><xref rid="fn2694">190</xref></sup> And according to the plain meaning thereof, it is to be connected with the section [immediately] following, [thus teaching] that he who sells [his land] has the right of redeeming it after two years, either personally or through his relative, and the purchaser cannot prevent it.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But it does not appear to me to be correct that Scripture should state in general terms in the section dealing with the Jubilee, [mentioned above], <italic>And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption</italic> [which according to Rashi speaks of the right of the seller to redeem the land of his possession], and then explain in the second section how this law applies: <italic>If thy brother be waxen poor</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2695">191</xref></sup></p>
<p>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that Scripture is stating: &#x201C;<italic>And in all the land of your possession</italic>, that is, the land which I give you for a possession, <italic>ye shall grant</italic> this <italic>redemption</italic> of the Jubilee.&#x201D; The term &#x201C;redemption&#x201D; is like <italic>the Eternal hath redeemed His servant Jacob</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2696">192</xref></sup> which means that He brought out His servant from the hand of those who held him [captive]. Similarly, <italic>and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2697">193</xref></sup> [means &#x201C;I will take Israel out of Egypt&#x201D;]. So also [the expression before us] <italic>ye shall grant a redemption for the Land</italic> means that I wish to redeem My Land from the hand of those who hold it, as I have not given it to them as a part of their possession. It was necessary that this be stated because He had said [as a reason for this law], <italic>for &#x2018;ha&#x2019;aretz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the earth</italic>) <italic>is Mine</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2698">194</xref></sup> and since the whole earth is His, therefore He stated additionally that the Jubilee only applies in the Land of our possession, not outside the Land [of Israel]. He stated <italic>and in all</italic> [<italic>&#x2018;and in all&#x2019; the land of your possession &#x2026;</italic>] meaning that it is to apply to all our possessions, including the other side of the Jordan and all places of [our] possession, and not only in &#x201C;the Land of the Eternal&#x201D; wherein the Sanctuary is located [i.e., westward of the Jordan, but the law of the Jubilee is to apply also in the land east of the Jordan where the Sanctuary of G-d may not be built &#x2014; see Ramban Numbers 21:21].</p>
<p>29. AND IF A MAN SELL A DWELLING-HOUSE IN A WALLED CITY. Since a man finds it very difficult to sell his house, and be disconcerted at the time of the sale, therefore the Torah wanted that he [have the right to] redeem it within the first year [after the sale]. And because man is <italic>servant to the field</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2699">195</xref></sup> and the bread of his sustenance comes from it, the Torah wanted [that if the seller did not redeem it before the Jubilee], it should go back [to him] in the <italic>Jubilee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2700">196</xref></sup> But with regard to a house [in a walled city], after [the seller] has given up hope [of regaining it], by changing his residence and staying for a year in another house, it can no longer cause him harm [if he cannot redeem it after a year], since his [source of] livelihood will not be diminished if it will be forfeited [to the purchaser]. <italic>And the houses of the villages</italic> [<italic>which have no wall round about them</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn2700">196</xref></sup> are made for the purpose of protecting the fields, and to serve as dwelling-places for those who cultivate the earth; therefore their law [of redemption] is similar to that of <italic>the fields of the country</italic> [i.e., they may be redeemed at any time until the Jubilee, and in the Jubilee they go back without compensation].</p>
<p>33. AND IF ONE OF THE LEVITES REDEEM. The plain meaning of this verse appears to be as follows: He had stated [in the previous verse], <italic>the Levites have a perpetual right of redemption</italic>, to redeem immediately [even before the period of two years after the sale of the fields, which an Israelite must wait before he is allowed to redeem], and to redeem at any time [a house in a walled city, even after the expiration of a year since the sale, after which time an Israelite cannot redeem]. But He did not explain with reference to them [the Levites] whether their relatives [also] have the right of redemption, nor whether the Jubilee applies to them. Therefore He stated again, <italic>And if one of the Levites redeem</italic>, be the redeemer the seller himself or his relative a Levite, <italic>then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the Jubilee</italic> from the hand of the purchaser. He should redeem it on this understanding, that <italic>he shall reckon the years of the sale thereof and restore the overplus</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2701">197</xref></sup> meaning to say that the Jubilee does apply to them [the Levites], and the manner of their redemption shall be as He said of the Israelites, <italic>and he shall reckon the years of the sale thereof</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2701">197</xref></sup></p>
<p>And our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn2702">198</xref></sup> that the verse speaks of a Levite who buys from a Levite. According to their word, the interpretation of the verse appears to me to be as follows: It was the custom in former times in Israel that when a man had to sell his field, the person who had precedence in his inheritance [i.e., who was the nearest relative who could inherit] would come and buy it, and it was this that was called &#x201C;redemption,&#x201D; as it is said, <italic>Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is thine to buy it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2703">199</xref></sup> and so also is it explained there in the matter of Boaz.<sup><xref rid="fn2704">200</xref></sup> And it appears to me that they administered a law of precedence for him, just as our Rabbis enacted for us the law of [the prerogative of] the neighbor,<sup><xref rid="fn2705">201</xref></sup> and [if other people wanted to buy it], they would acquire [the right of possession] from the &#x201C;first redeemer&#x201D; by the [symbolic act of] acquisition of a scarf, as did Boaz.<sup><xref rid="fn2706">202</xref></sup> Thus Scripture is stating here that when a Levite redeems the inheritance of a Levite, that is to say, when he buys it from him as is the law of redemption, then that [land] acquired shall go out in the Jubilee. It thus teaches that the Jubilee applies to them [the Levites] in the case of &#x201C;redemption&#x201D; just as in the case of any other sale [among Israelites]. Scripture did not have to mention this law in the case of a plain sale [i.e., to say that if a Levite sold his field to a non-Levite, who is not his near relative, that it goes back to its original owner, the Levite, in the Jubilee], for they [Levites] are part of all Israel [and it is self-understood that the same laws apply to them]; except that He strengthened their legal right [by giving them, as explained above], a perpetual [privilege of] redemption. This law of &#x201C;redemption&#x201D; applies also to Israelites [i.e., that if they bought from Levites, the Levites have an unrestricted right of redemption forever]. Scripture, however, mentioned it with reference to the Levites, in order that one should not say that the [forty-eight] cities<sup><xref rid="fn2707">203</xref></sup> were only given to the whole tribe of Levi [and not to any particular person], and that therefore [fields which a Levite had sold] go back from an Israelite [in the Jubilee, i.e., if the purchaser was an Israelite he must give them back], but they do not go back from a Levite [i.e., if the purchaser was a Levite he does not have to give them back, since they remain anyway in the hands of the Levitical tribe], and certainly [we might think that] from a near kinsman [i.e., a Levite] whom we have made liable to buy [the field of his poor brother-Levite, those fields surely do not go back in the Jubilee]; therefore He said that this <italic>redemption</italic> too goes back in the Jubilee, and from the [law stated in connection with the] Levite we deduce [that the same law applies] to the Israelites. It is possible also that the Levites are not permitted to sell of their cities in any transaction [i.e., whether a field or house] to an Israelite, and therefore all their purchases are termed <italic>redemption</italic> [because only other Levites, who are their kinsmen, can buy from them].</p>
<p>35. THAT HE MAY LIVE WITH THEE. The meaning thereof is that he [i.e., the stranger or settler]<sup><xref rid="fn2708">204</xref></sup> shall [be enabled to] live with you, it being a positive commandment to support him, and it is from here [that we deduce] that we are commanded by means of a positive commandment to save life. It is from here too, that the Sages have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2709">205</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>That thy brother may live with thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2710">206</xref></sup> This was explained by Ben Peturi: If two people were going on a journey [in the desert], and one of them has a pitcher of water which [contains such an amount that] if he [alone] drinks it, [it would suffice to enable him to] reach an inhabited place, but if both drink from it, both would die. Ben Peturi stated: &#x2018;It is better that both should drink and die, rather than that one should witness the death of his colleague,&#x2019; until Rabbi Akiba came and taught: <italic>that thy brother may live with thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2710">206</xref></sup> &#x2014; thy life takes precedence over the life of thy colleague.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He repeated [the phrase] <italic>that thy brother may live with thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2710">206</xref></sup> in order to emphasize and stress [that we are not to take from him any interest or increase, as is stated in the first part of that verse]. And the Rabbinical interpretation is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn2711">207</xref></sup> &#x201C;Return to him the interest, so that he may live with you.&#x201D; Thus He commanded the return of [previously] stipulated interest, similar to that which He said in the case of robbery, <italic>and he shall restore that which he took by robbery</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2712">208</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Onkelos rendered <italic>&#x2018;geir v&#x2019;thoshav vachai imach&#x2019;</italic> [generally translated: <italic>a stranger and a settler that he may live with thee</italic>] as part of the positive commandments [enumerated here, thus meaning:] &#x201C;he shall sojourn and settle and live with you.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2713">209</xref></sup> But according to the opinion of our Rabbis in the Gemara,<sup><xref rid="fn2714">210</xref></sup> the sense of the verse is as follows: [&#x201C;<italic>And if thy brother be waxen poor &#x2026;</italic>] <italic>then thou shalt uphold him</italic>, and [thou shalt also uphold] <italic>a stranger and a settler</italic>, so that each one of them <italic>shall live with thee</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>36. TAKE THOU NO &#x2018;NESHECH&#x2019; (INTEREST) OF HIM OR &#x2018;RIBITH&#x2019; (INCREASE). &#x201C;The Rabbis explained [these two terms &#x2014; &#x2018;interest&#x2019; and &#x2018;increase&#x2019;] as one, and [the reason why Scripture mentioned two different words is to teach us that he who transgresses this law] violates two negative commandments.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. The plain meaning of the verse appears to me to be that <italic>neshech</italic> (interest) is where, [for example], he lends him a hundred [shekels] and [the borrower is] to give him five shekels each year [for the use of the money, without deducting it from the capital sum of the loan]. It is so called [<italic>neshech</italic>, literally &#x201C;biting&#x201D;] because <italic>at the last &#x2018;yishach&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>it biteth</italic>) <italic>like a snake</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2715">211</xref></sup> [the effect of whose bite is not noticed immediately, but which] spurts and increases. <italic>Tarbith</italic> [or <italic>ribith</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;increase&#x201D;], however, is if he lends him [a sum of money] until a certain time, and then [the borrower is to] repay him and give him an increase of five shekels, but [even if the repayment should be delayed], there is no [additional] increase after that time [i.e., there is one fixed sum and not an annual percentage]; this [form of interest] does not &#x201C;bite&#x201D;, since it will not go up more than that [fixed] sum, but it is [nonetheless] &#x201C;an increase.&#x201D; Therefore He stated, <italic>Thou shalt not give him thy money &#x2018;b&#x2019;neshech&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>upon interest</italic>), <italic>nor give him thy food &#x2018;b&#x2019;marbith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>for increase</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2716">212</xref></sup> for it is customary to lend money for <italic>neshech</italic> (interest), [the borrower being obliged] to give every year [a certain amount of money for the use of the capital borrowed], but food is [usually] lent until the time of reaping, and then he pays him back out of his granary with a stipulated addition.</p>
<p>40. AS A HIRED SERVANT, AND AS A SETTLER, HE SHALL BE WITH THEE. The meaning of this is that he [your brother who sold himself to you] shall not be with you in your house as a bondservant, but <italic>as a laborer hired year by year</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2717">213</xref></sup> who hires himself out to do work as a freeman, and who is not subjected to heavy work; or [he is to be in your house] <italic>as a settler</italic>, for it is customary that settlers who come to sojourn in [another] land work for the head of the household with whom they reside to their satisfaction, similar to the case of Jacob with Laban, where [Laban] said [to Jacob], <italic>Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2718">214</xref></sup> And in the Torath Kohanim it is written:<sup><xref rid="fn2719">215</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>As a hired servant</italic> &#x2014; just as [in the case of] a hired servant <italic>in the same day thou shalt give him his hire</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2720">216</xref></sup> so too, this one must be given his hire in the same day.<sup><xref rid="fn2721">217</xref></sup> <italic>As a settler</italic> &#x2014; just as [in the case of] a settler <italic>he shall dwell with thee &#x2026; where it liketh him best; thou shalt not wrong him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2722">218</xref></sup> this one also <italic>where it liketh him best; thou shalt not wrong him. &#x2014; He shall be with thee</italic>, with thee concerning [the same kind of] food, with thee concerning [the same kind of] drink, with thee concerning [the same kind of] clean garment, etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2723">219</xref></sup></p>
<p>47. AND IF A STRANGER WHO IS A SETTLER WITH THEE BE WAXEN RICH, AND THY BROTHER BE WAXEN POOR BESIDE HIM, AND SELL HIMSELF UNTO THE STRANGER WHO IS A SETTLER WITH THEE, OR &#x2018;L&#x2019;EIKER&#x2019; (TO THE STOCK OF) THE FAMILY OF &#x2018;GEIR&#x2019; (A STRANGER). &#x201C;<italic>The family of &#x2018;geir&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; this means an idolater. Since Scripture [also] stated <italic>l&#x2019;eiker</italic> (&#x2018;to the stock of&#x2019; the idolater), it refers to one who sold himself to the idol itself &#x2014; to be its servant; not to worship it as a deity, but to hew wood and draw water for its service.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language derived from the Torath Kohanim.<sup><xref rid="fn2724">220</xref></sup> And if so, the verse is saying: <italic>l&#x2019;eiker &#x2018;u&#x2019;mishpachath geir</italic> [&#x201C;to the stock of &#x2018;and&#x2019; to the family of the stranger,&#x201D; &#x2014; since according to Rashi the verse speaks of two different people &#x2014; and omits the conjunctive &#x201C;and&#x201D; and merely says, <italic>l&#x2019;eiker mishpachath geir</italic> &#x2014; literally &#x201C;to the stock of the family of a stranger&#x201D;]. Scripture calls the idol <italic>eiker</italic> [&#x201C;plucking&#x201D; or &#x201C;uprooting&#x201D;] because a person is dutybound to uproot thoroughly an object of idol-worship and to extirpate it.</p>
<p>But Onkelos translated <italic>l&#x2019;eiker</italic> &#x2014; <italic>l&#x2019;armai</italic> (&#x201C;to a gentile&#x201D;), and this is the correct interpretation. Scripture is thus mentioning [the case of a Hebrew who] sold himself to a stranger who dwells with us, or who sold himself <italic>&#x2018;l&#x2019;eiker mishpachath geir&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>to the stock of the stranger&#x2019;s family</italic>), who is himself a gentile, the word <italic>eiker</italic> thus being related to the expression <italic>&#x2018;ikar sharshohi&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the stump of its roots</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2725">221</xref></sup> Scripture states <italic>&#x2018;mishpachath geir&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the family of the stranger</italic>) [in order to indicate that] the stranger or the settler who became rich with us brought it about that the brother [i.e., the Israelite] become poor beside him [because he had emulated his ways] and thus be sold to the stock of the family of the stranger. Scripture commanded that he must be redeemed,<sup><xref rid="fn2726">222</xref></sup> this being a positive commandment upon all Israel that we are to redeem him, and then it commanded his kinsmen that they are the first [in this duty].<sup><xref rid="fn2727">223</xref></sup> The purpose of the commandment is clear, that he should not become assimilated and learn from the ways [of his purchasers]. For in the case of [all] other sales, the redemption by kinsmen is a matter of choice [but here it is an obligation]. Therefore He said here, <italic>For unto Me the children of Israel are servants; they are My servants</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2728">224</xref></sup> meaning to say that &#x201C;although the stranger who settled [with us] and the stock of his family do not have to observe the commandment of the Jubilee, they cannot buy My servants to be their [permanent] servants.&#x201D;</p>
<h1>26</h1>
<p>1. YE SHALL MAKE YOU NO IDOLS. &#x201C;Scripture is speaking with reference to this person [mentioned above] who sold himself to an idolater, that he should not say, &#x2018;Since my master worships idols, I will also worship them; Since my master is immoral, I too will be dissolute; since my master does not observe the Sabbath, I will also profane the Sabbath.&#x2019; Scripture therefore states, <italic>Ye shall make you no idols &#x2026; Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and reverence My Sanctuary</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2729">225</xref></sup> Thus Scripture warned concerning [the observance of] the commandments.&#x201D; This is the language of the Torath Kohanim,<sup><xref rid="fn2730">226</xref></sup> and the interpretation [thereof is as follows]: Scripture warned the servant who sold himself to an idolater to be heedful of the commandments concerning idolatry and the Sabbath, &#x2014; as well as the reverence due to the Sanctuary, which he should come to on the festivals and treat with awe,<sup><xref rid="fn2731">227</xref></sup> and the same warning applies with regard to all the commandments. However, He mentioned only these commandments as they are the main ones, and they indicate [that the same principle applies] to all of them. Now some texts of the Torath Kohanim have this reading: &#x201C;Scripture &#x2018;mentioned here&#x2019; [the commandments,&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;Thus Scripture warned,&#x201D; as stated above]. If this is the correct text, then the Rabbis [of the Torath Kohanim] alluded to [the concept] that all the commandments are included in the Sabbath and the Sanctuary. The person learned [in the mysteries of the Cabala] will understand.<sup><xref rid="fn2732">228</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2505">(1) I.e. Rashi. Having quoted the text of the Torath Kohanim, Rashi now proceeds to explain the basis of the analogy of this text of the Beraitha between our section and all other commandments. To follow Rashi&#x2019;s answer it is important to recall that in the final year of Israel&#x2019;s stay in the wilderness, when they were encamped <italic>in the plains of Moab</italic> (Numbers 22:1), Moses, in the last days of his life, restated the commandments of G-d, his words being contained in the Book of Deuteronomy. However, since not all the commandments were restated there by Moses, our verse serves as a basis for the interpretation of the Torath Kohanim, as will be explained by Rashi. Ramban will differ with this whole approach, since the text of the Torath Kohanim makes no reference at all to Moses&#x2019; restatement of the laws in the plains of Moab. See at end of Note 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2506">(2) In other words, we can be certain that those commandments which were not mentioned <italic>in the plains of Moab</italic> [and are recorded in other parts of the Torah], were declared at some preceding time, but we cannot be sure whether they were said with the commandments given at Sinai, or only later on, after the building of the Tabernacle from which G-d communicated to Moses. On what basis, then, does Rashi say that they were all given on Sinai?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2507">(3) Exodus 21:1. Since these ordinances were declared before the Tabernacle was erected, they must perforce have been given on Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2508">(4) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 23:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2509">(5) Further, 27:34.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2510">(6) Torath Kohanim, end of <italic>Seder Bechukothai</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2511">(7) This is a major teaching in Judaism, that the prophets who came after Moses only served to exhort Israel to obey the laws given by Moses, but no new Divine commandments were added.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2512">(8) Malbim to Torath Kohanim <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2513">(9) &#x201C;And that the Torah be given through Moses. For if Israel had not accepted the Torah, the Divine Glory would not have communicated with Moses, because where there is no flock there is no shepherd, and if there is a flock there must be a shepherd&#x201D; (Rabad in his commentary to Torath Kohanim, <italic>ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2514">(10) The Hebrew expression <italic>kaftor vaferach</italic> literally means &#x201C;a knop and a flower.&#x201D; The term is borrowed from the design of the candelabrum (see Exodus 25:33), and here means &#x201C;a thing of truth, and beautifully stated.&#x201D; The usage of this expression is found in Bereshith Rabbah 91:12. It has been suggested that since the candelabrum in the Tabernacle represented the light of wisdom, the knops and flowers in the candelabrum symbolized truth beautifully expressed. Hence the expression <italic>kaftor vaferach</italic> as applied to a dictum of truth well formulated. &#x2014; In essence, Ramban&#x2019;s understanding of the Beraitha mentioned by Rashi is as follows: &#x201C;Why is the expression <italic>in Mount Sinai</italic> mentioned here? It cannot be to teach us that the <italic>general principles</italic> of the Sabbatical year were given on Sinai, for all commandments were declared on Sinai in general terms, the Sabbatical year being merely one of them, as expressly stated in Exodus 23:11. Hence the expression here <italic>in Mount Sinai</italic> must be to teach that all its specific prescripts were also given on Mount Sinai, and from this you may deduce that the verse at the end of the Book of Leviticus, which states, <italic>These are the commandments which the Eternal commanded Moses &#x2026; in Mount Sinai</italic> intends to teach us that the specific prescripts of <italic>all</italic> the laws were also declared on Sinai. &#x2014; Ramban&#x2019;s interpretation is thus not based at all on Moses&#x2019; restatement of the laws in the plains of Moab, as is that of Rashi, but instead is founded upon the verses in Exodus 23:11, and at the end of Leviticus, as explained.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2537">(33) In other words, we are to observe the Sabbatical year primarily as a mark of honor to G-d, and not for our benefit, in that by lying fallow for a year the land will improve. The same applies to the weekly Sabbath, which we celebrate in honor of the Creator of the world, and not primarily because we benefit physically from a day of rest. (Mizrachi).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2538">(34) Exodus 20:10. See note above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2539">(35) In other words, it is true that in the Torath Kohanim (<italic>Behar</italic> 1:2) there is such an interpretation of the Rabbis, likening the expression <italic>a Sabbath unto the Eternal</italic> stated here in the case of the Sabbatical year to that mentioned in the law of the weekly Sabbath. But the intent thereof is not as Rashi presented it, for etc. The full text of the Beraitha of the Torath Kohanim will be mentioned further on by Ramban.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2554">(50) Jeremiah 34:13-14. &#x2014; The verse there reads <italic>&#x2018;mikeitz sheva shanim&#x2019;</italic>, which is normally translated as &#x201C;at the <italic>end</italic> of seven years&#x201D; (so also in the J.P.S. translation). Ramban in Deuteronomy 15:1, however, brings proofs that the correct meaning in this context is &#x201C;at the end-year of the seven years&#x201D;, i.e., at the beginning of seventh year, rather than &#x201C;at the end of the seventh year.&#x201D; Thus the Hebrew servant goes free at the <italic>beginning</italic> of the seventh year [the <italic>end-year</italic> of the cycle of seven years], and this is indeed the accepted law (Rambam, <italic>Hilchoth Avadim</italic> 2:1) that he serves for six years. See, however, Yonathan ben Uziel in Jeremiah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2555">(51) In other words, in the Scriptural account of the creation &#x2014; commencing with the verse, <italic>In the beginning</italic> &#x2026; and concluding with <italic>&#x2018;Vayechulu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>And there were finished</italic>) (2:1) &#x2014; the secret of the Jubilee is already hinted at, namely, &#x201C;that all things, that came into existence in the beginning of time will be finished in the era of the Jubilee (Beiur Ha&#x2019;lvush to Ricanti who quotes the language of Ramban).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2569">(65) The thought expressed is as follows: When Israel observes the law of the Sabbatical year G-d blesses the produce of the Land during the next six years. But if the law of the Torah is not observed, the farmer must leave his field fallow every alternate year in order to preserve the soil. Thus if the law of the Sabbatical year is observed, only one year of rest of the Land is required in a seven-year cycle, but where the law of the Torah is not observed, there must be four years of rest &#x2014; the first, the third, the fifth, and the seventh. The meaning of the verse, according to this Mechilta [which is, as Ramban calls it here, &#x201C;a homiletic exposition&#x201D;], is thus: &#x201C;six full years you will be able to sow your field without recourse to a rest of the Land, if in the seventh year there shall be a solemn rest for the Land&#x201D; (Zeh Yenachameinu &#x2014; a commentary upon the Mechilta).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2593">(89) In other words, the aftergrowths of these four kinds of fields may be taken by anyone during all normal years, because the owners consider these growths ownerless; and in the Sabbatical year, since the owners are not suspected of having violated the law against planting them, they are permissible to the owners together with everyone else. But in all other fields, since the aftergrowths during any non-Sabbatical year are forbidden to be taken by strangers because the owners do not wish to relinquish their possession of them, in the Sabbatical year they are subject to the law of aftergrowths, as will be explained.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2594">(90) Torath Kohanim, <italic>Behar</italic> 1:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2595">(91) For if a person has an obligation to bring any offering, as for instance if he commits one of those sins for which he must bring a sin-offering, etc., he must discharge his duty from unhallowed money, and since the money-substitute of the Seventh-year produce is as sacred as the original produce, therefore this obligatory offering cannot be bought with this money.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2596">(92) In the first and second years of the Sabbatical cycle, as well as in the fourth and fifth years, the First and Second Tithes are given of all produce, while in the third and sixth years, the First and the Poorman&#x2019;s Tithes are given. The First Tithe is given to the Levite; the Second Tithe belongs to the owner, but he must eat it in Jerusalem. The Poorman&#x2019;s Tithe is given to the poor, and they may eat it wherever they are. Now each group of produce has different rules to determine which is the relevant year for its specific tithes, since different factors apply; for instance: the fruits, crops and vegetables. The point here is that in the case of vegetables the determining factor is the time when they are gathered. Hence if, for example, the vegetables grew in the second year and were collected in the third, the tithes given are the First and Poorman&#x2019;s Tithes. Similarly, if they grew in the sixth year and were collected in the seventh, the laws of the Sabbatical year apply to these vegetables, as specifically explained in the text.</ftnote>

The difference between these two cases is generally explained to be that the latter transaction resembles a sale [<italic>in exchange</italic> for the coin he gathers for him the vegetables], and it is forbidden to sell Seventh-year produce; therefore the money is &#x201C;seized&#x201D; with the sanctity of the original produce.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2606">(102) In other words, if the <italic>chaver</italic> (a person who is faithful in observing the law) sees the owner [who is ignorant of the law] taking the fruits from an unguarded field, he may give him the monetary equivalent of three meals&#x2019; worth of fruits; but he is not permitted to give the owner more money than that required for three meals, for since such money must be spent according to the restrictions of the sanctity of the Sabbatical year [i.e., he must spend it only for food, drink or unguent] it is feared that the seller receiving such money may not do so. But the Sages permitted the <italic>chaver</italic> to give him the monetary equivalent of three meals so that he may have sufficient food for himself [for a day] (Rashi, <italic>ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2623">(119) For with respect to the store-house, all people are regarded as &#x201C;poor,&#x201D; but an owner of a field may not eat of his own fruits after the Removal.

<ftnote id="fn2624">(120) Nedarim 58 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2625">(121) Thus if a person took an onion which grew in the sixth year [of the Sabbatical cycle] and replanted it in the seventh year, even though it only grows a small amount in the seventh year the whole onion is subject to the law of Removal, as if it had grown entirely in the seventh year. Normally any forbidden food which becomes unrecognizable in a mixture the majority of which consists of permitted food, is considered negligible and &#x201C;annulled&#x201D; by the majority according to the law of the Torah [however, the Rabbis usually required a ratio of 60:1, for the forbidden food to become annulled]. However, any forbidden food which will at some future time have a permitted status, can never become annulled even if it is a minute part of the permitted part of the mixture; for why should we annul it now when it will eventually become permitted automatically? Here too, since the minute forbidden part of the onion which grew in the seventh year will automatically become permitted to be eaten when the owner declares it free for all at the time of Removal, it does not become annulled by the rest of the onion. Thus the whole of the onion is subject to the law of Removal [since we do not know which is the bit which grew in the seventh year]; and if the owner does not declare it free for all, it is completely forbidden. Ramban quotes this to prove that Removal does not mean destruction of the produce, but merely declaring it free for all, as the Gemara clearly states that it becomes permitted after Removal.</ftnote>

Rabbi Yehoshua says: Even until the last [to ripen of the three kinds] remains in the field, etc.&#x201D; Ramban intends to say that if, as mentioned above, the whole law of Removal of Seventh-year produce is only a decree of Rabbinic origin, we may well understand why Rabbi Yehoshua is lenient in this case. &#x2014; See also Ramban further on in Verse 12 where he quotes this whole text from the Torath Kohanim, and it is more fully explained.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2634">(130) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 6:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2635">(131) This is the city of Achzib, mentioned in Joshua 19:29, and Judges 1:31. It was in the vicinity of Acco, as is clear from the verse in the Book of Judges (Tifereth Yisrael). To understand this Mishnah it is important to remember that the sanctity first imparted to the Land of Israel by Joshua&#x2019;s conquests came to an end with the destruction of the First Temple. Now when the Jews returned from the Babylonian exile and reoccuppied the Land, their settlement was not as large as that originally occupied by those that came up from Egypt. The sanctity imparted to this part of the Land which was re-occupied by the Babylonian exiles was never lost again; and it is to this part that the laws of the Seventh year fully apply.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2636">(132) I.e., the Brook of Egypt (Joshua 15:47) in the south (Tifereth Shlomoh).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2637">(133) I.e. Mount Hor (Numbers 34:7) to the north. The Mishnah thus covers two points from Chezib: from the south thereof to the Brook of Egypt, and from the north thereof to Mount Hor (Tifereth Shlomoh).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2638">(134) As suggested above by Ramban, the reason for this leniency concerning Removal may be that the whole matter is of Rabbinic origin.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2641">(137) Moed Katan 2 b. In other words, this was why the Talmud Yerushalmi quoted the words of this man. In our editions of the Gemara, the version is &#x201C;Rabbi&#x201D; [the editor of the Mishnah] instead of Rabbi Shimon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2642">(138) Deuteronomy 15:2: <italic>And this is the manner of the &#x2018;release:&#x2019; every creditor shall &#x2018;release&#x2019; that which he hath lent unto his neighbor</italic>. The double use of the term &#x201C;release&#x201D; indicates that Scripture speaks here of two kinds of release: the release of the land in the Sabbatical year, and the release of monetary debts, and Scripture likens one to another to teach us the following: &#x201C;At a time the release of the land is in force the release of money is obligatory, but at a time when the release of the land is not in force, the release of money is not obligatory.&#x201D; And since Rabbi Shimon speaks of &#x201C;a time when the release of the Land is not obligatory,&#x201D; he must be referring to the time after the destruction of the Second Temple. (Rashi, Moed Katan 2 b). Thus it is clear that Rabbi Shimon is of the opinion that the law of the Seventh-year produce nowadays is of Rabbinic enactment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2643">(139) Rosh Hashanah 29 b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2644">(140) The title &#x201C;Rabban&#x201D; [our master] instead of just &#x201C;Rabbi,&#x201D; indicates that he was the head of the Sanhedrin. The title also appears above at the end of Verse 7: &#x201C;Rabban Gamaliel.&#x201D; Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai was the leading Sage in the period of the destruction of the Second Temple [in the year 70 Common Era]. It was he who went to Vespasian the Roman general and obtained permission to open an academy at Jabneh, which, after the destruction of the Temple, took the place of the Sanhedrin as the supreme religious authority for the Jewish people. Under his leadership a number of regulations were instituted by the Sages in remembrance of the Temple.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2645">(141) Ramban&#x2019;s point here is as follows: As far as the blowing of the <italic>Shofar</italic> on the New Year is concerned, there is a clear distinction between a New Year which falls on a weekday and one which occurs on the Sabbath. In the latter case, Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai prohibited blowing the <italic>Shofar</italic> [except at the court] lest someone may accidentally carry the <italic>Shofar</italic> and thereby transgress a law of the Torah, as explained in the text. But when the New Year falls on a weekday, there is no question of forbidding blowing the <italic>Shofar</italic>, because carrying on a festival is permitted. But on the Day of Atonement, unlike other festivals, carrying is prohibited as on the Sabbath. Thus when the Beraitha quoted by Rashi states that the blowing of the Jubilee horn was permitted on the Day of Atonement which fell on the Sabbath, this is equivalent to saying that it is permitted on <italic>every</italic> Day of Atonement, whether weekday or Sabbath. Hence the thought conveyed by the Beraitha is not as Rashi has it [that the blowing of the Jubilee overrides the Sabbath day], for as the Day of Atonement is concerned everyday of the week is like the Sabbath&#x0021;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2646">(142) Above, 25:8. See Ramban <italic>ibid.</italic>, 23:15 that this counting is done by the court only.</ftnote>

Mizrachi in defense of Rashi writes that Rashi means that &#x201C;the year in which every man returns to his possession and to his family, is called <italic>yoveil</italic> (Jubilee) on account of the blowing of the <italic>Shofar</italic>,&#x201D; but not that the word <italic>yoveil</italic> means &#x201C;blowing.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<title>Bechukothai</title>
<p>4. THEN WILL I GIVE YOUR RAINS IN THEIR SEASON. He mentioned the matter of rains first [of all the blessings] because if they come in their proper season, the air is pure and good and the springs and rivers are good [clear], and thus it [the rain] is a [prime] cause of physical health, and all produce will increase and be blessed by it, just as He said, <italic>and the Land shall yield her produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2733">1</xref></sup> Thus because of this [pure state of the environment] people do not become sick, and <italic>none shall miscarry, nor be barren</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2734">2</xref></sup> even among their cattle,<sup><xref rid="fn2735">3</xref></sup> and they will live out [the full extent of] their days.<sup><xref rid="fn2736">4</xref></sup> For when the material frame [of human beings] is large and healthy, they can continue [in health] as in the days of Adam.<sup><xref rid="fn2737">5</xref></sup> Thus this [blessing &#x2014; the rains in their seasons] is the greatest of all blessings [and therefore it is given first place].</p>
<p>Now He said that the heavens will respond to the earth<sup><xref rid="fn2738">6</xref></sup> with rains in their seasons, and the earth shall respond<sup><xref rid="fn2739">7</xref></sup> with its &#x201C;produce&#x201D;, which includes vegetation and all moving creatures &#x2014; cattle, beasts, creeping things and fowl, as well as fish &#x2014; for the term <italic>ha&#x2019;aretz</italic> [&#x201C;the earth&#x201D; or &#x201C;the land,&#x201D; in <italic>and &#x2018;the land&#x2019; shall yield her produce</italic>] includes the whole of the lower sphere [i.e., everything under the sphere of the moon], just as [in the verses]: <italic>In the beginning G-d created the heaven and &#x2018;ha&#x2019;aretz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the earth</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn2740">8</xref></sup> <italic>And the heaven and &#x2018;ha&#x2019;aretz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the earth</italic>) <italic>were finished;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2741">9</xref></sup> and similarly, <italic>Praise the Eternal from &#x2018;ha&#x2019;aretz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the earth</italic>), <italic>ye sea-monsters and all deeps</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2742">10</xref></sup> and so also in most verses in Scripture [where this word occurs]. Thus all things created in the lower spheres are &#x201C;the produce of the earth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>6. AND I WILL GIVE PEACE IN THE LAND &#x2014; So that there will be peace among you, and no man shall fight against his brother,<sup><xref rid="fn2743">11</xref></sup> or &#x201C;peace&#x201D; may mean that <italic>He will cause evil beasts to cease out of the Land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2744">12</xref></sup> <italic>Neither shall the sword go through your Land</italic> at all, but you will pursue your enemies,<sup><xref rid="fn2745">13</xref></sup> going forth against them in battle, and they will flee. And [the meaning of the verse] by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], is that He will give peace which will cleave to the [higher]<sup><xref rid="fn2746">14</xref></sup> &#x201C;earth,&#x201D; which is the all-inclusive peace which is equal to everything.</p>
<p>AND I WILL CAUSE EVIL BEASTS TO CEASE OUT OF THE LAND. According to Rabbi Yehudah who said<sup><xref rid="fn2747">15</xref></sup> that He will remove them from the world [entirely, the verse] is [to be understood] in its plain sense &#x2014; that evil beasts will not come into their Land. For since there will be plentitude and an abundance of blessings, and the cities will be full of people, [wild] beasts will not come into inhabited places. And according to Rabbi Shimon who says that He will cause them to cease from causing harm, the verse is stating: &#x201C;and I will cause the evil of the beasts to cease out of the Land.&#x201D; This is the correct interpretation for when [Israel] observes the commandments, the Land of Israel will be like the world was at its beginning, before the sin of the first man, when no wild beast or creeping thing would kill a man, just as the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2748">16</xref></sup> &#x201C;It is not the wild ass that kills, but it is sin that kills.&#x201D; It is [because of] this that Scripture says, <italic>and the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2749">17</xref></sup> and similarly, <italic>and the cow and the bear shall feed &#x2026; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2750">18</xref></sup> For dangerous beasts only prey [on human beings] on account of the sin of man, because of which it was decreed upon him that he be <italic>a prey to their teeth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2751">19</xref></sup> and preying was made a part of their nature so that they also prey on each other, as is well-known for having once preyed on man, they add [to this tendency that of preying on animals] so that they become more harmful. And so Scripture states, <italic>And he learned to catch the prey, he devoured men</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2752">20</xref></sup> Now at the time of the creation of the world, it is said of the beasts that He gave them the herb for food, as it is written, <italic>And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is a living soul, I have given every green herb for food</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2753">21</xref></sup> and Scripture states, <italic>and it was so</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2753">21</xref></sup> meaning that such was the nature with which they were endowed forever. It was [only] afterwards that they learned how to prey, on account of [human] sin which causes death, as I have explained. Now when slaughtering animals [for food] became permitted for the sons of Noah after the flood,<sup><xref rid="fn2754">22</xref></sup> He warned with reference to humans [that shedding their blood was forbidden saying], <italic>And surely your blood of your lives will I require &#x2026; the life of man</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2755">23</xref></sup> but not the blood of one beast from the hand of another, for they were left to prey [on each other and on man] as was their wont. But the beasts of the Land of Israel, when [man will be] in a state of perfection, will cease from their harmful way, and revert to their original nature with which they were endowed at the time of their creation. I have already referred to a part of this in <italic>Seder Eileh Toldoth Noach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2755">23</xref></sup> Therefore Scripture stated concerning the time of the redeemer who is descended of the stock of Jesse, that peace will return to the world and preying and all dangerous beasts will cease, as was their nature at first. The [original] intention [when referring to the redeemer was in connection with] Hezekiah [king of Judah], whom the Holy One, blessed be He, had wished to make the Messiah,<sup><xref rid="fn2756">24</xref></sup> but their merits [i.e., those of the people of his generation] were not sufficient for such [achievement], so that the fulfillment [of that prophecy] will be with reference to the Messiah who is destined to come.</p>
<p>8. AND YOUR ENEMIES SHALL FALL BEFORE YOU BY THE SWORD. He assured them at first that they would chase their enemies and that they would fall by their sword,<sup><xref rid="fn2757">25</xref></sup> and then He stated again by way of repetition [in the verse before us], <italic>and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword</italic>, in order to give them fortitude of heart and strength so that five [of them would not be afraid] to pursue a hundred. He [furthermore promised that He] would put faintness into the heart of their enemies, so that a hundred would [in fact] flee before five, and would all fall by the sword of the five, for it would be possible that they [a hundred people] would flee because of the sword and because of their fear, but that they would not be able to kill them by the sword because of their few numbers [therefore He mentioned specifically that they would be able to put them to the sword too]. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has said that this repetition [in our verse] means that they [the enemies] will fall continually, time after time, without regaining [their strength].</p>
<p>9. AND I WILL MAKE YOU FRUITFUL. This means that they will all have children, fruit of the womb, and there will be no barren man or woman among them.<sup><xref rid="fn2758">26</xref></sup> And then He stated again, <italic>and I will multiply you</italic>, meaning that they will have many children, and will not be bereaved of them, because they will live out their days,<sup><xref rid="fn2736">4</xref></sup> and therefore they will be a large people.</p>
<p>11. AND I WILL SET MY TABERNACLE AMONG YOU. &#x201C;This means the Sanctuary [at Jerusalem].&#x201D; AND MY SOUL SHALL NOT &#x2018;THIG&#x2019;AL&#x2019; (ABHOR) YOU. &#x201C;This means that My spirit shall not reject you. Every [form of the term] <italic>ge&#x2019;ilah</italic> is an expression of spewing out something that has been absorbed in another substance, such as: <italic>for there &#x2018;nig&#x2019;al&#x2019; the shield of the mighty</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2759">27</xref></sup> meaning that the shield was not receptive to the oil with which it was anointed; for they used to anoint a leather shield with boiled [fat], in order to make the blows of arrows or spears glance off it, so that it should not pierce the leather.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>But I do not know what would be the meaning of this, that the Holy One, blessed be He, should say that if we keep all the commandments and do His will, He will not reject us and His soul will not abhor us&#x0021; Similarly when [speaking of] our transgressing His covenant [with us], and committing <italic>great provocations</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2760">28</xref></sup> He said, <italic>I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2761">29</xref></sup> And the prophet [Jeremiah] said at the time of cursing [i.e., the prediction of the destruction of the First Sanctuary], <italic>Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah? Hast Thy soul loathed Zion?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2762">30</xref></sup> But this subject is one of the secrets of the mysteries of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2763">31</xref></sup> Scripture is thus stating that He will set His Tabernacle among us, and that &#x201C;the soul&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2764">32</xref></sup> from which the Tabernacle<sup><xref rid="fn2765">33</xref></sup> comes, will not spew us forth as a pot which we scour in hot water [in order to cleanse it of substances it has absorbed], but instead our <italic>garments will always be white</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2766">34</xref></sup> and new. For the term <italic>ge&#x2019;ilah</italic> denotes, as Rashi said, &#x201C;casting out,&#x201D; related to the expression, <italic>his bull gendereth and doth not &#x2018;yag&#x2019;il&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>allow the cow to reject as loathsome</italic>), <italic>his cow calveth, and casteth not her calf</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2767">35</xref></sup> He states here <italic>My soul</italic> [<italic>and &#x2018;My soul&#x2019; shall not abhor you</italic>] similar to the expression, <italic>the Eternal G-d hath sworn by His soul</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2768">36</xref></sup> And the prophet [Jeremiah] thus is saying by way of amazement: &#x201C;<italic>Hast Thou loathed Zion</italic>, itself<sup><xref rid="fn2762">30</xref></sup> which is <italic>a city and a mother in Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2769">37</xref></sup> and hast Thou cast her from before thee, so that all her sons are <italic>clothed with filthy garments</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2770">38</xref></sup> polluted [with sin]?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now according to their simple sense, these blessings, which are many and [stated in] general terms [affecting the people as a whole], &#x2014; such as rain, plenitude, peace and the fruitfulness of people &#x2014; are unlike the blessings with which He has already blessed [the people] in brief, saying, <italic>And He will bless thy bread, and thy water, and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2771">39</xref></sup> For there He assured them that their food and drink would be [a source of] blessing, so that no sickness will occur to our bodies, and therefore the organs of procreation will be complete and healthy and we will give birth properly, and live full lives, as He said, <italic>None shall miscarry, nor be barren in thy Land, the number of thy days will I fulfill</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2772">40</xref></sup> and similarly He said at the beginning, <italic>for I am the Eternal that healeth thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2773">41</xref></sup> The reason for this [division of the blessings into two sections] is that [all] the blessings [mentioned in the Torah], although they are miraculous, are hidden miracles of which the whole Torah is full, as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2774">42</xref></sup> They apply even to an individual who serves [Him], for when there is a pious man who keeps all the commandments of his G-d, the Eternal G-d will guard him from sickness, barrenness and bereavement, and he will live out his days in goodness. But these blessings which are stated in this section are general ones applying to the people [as a whole], and they [take effect] when the whole of our people <italic>shall all be righteous</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2775">43</xref></sup> Therefore He mentions here always <italic>the Land: and the Land shall yield;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2776">44</xref></sup> <italic>in your Land safely;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2777">45</xref></sup> <italic>peace in the Land;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2778">46</xref></sup> <italic>out of the Land;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2778">46</xref></sup> <italic>it shall not go through your Land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2778">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now we have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn2774">42</xref></sup> that all these blessings are miracles, for it is not natural that the rains should come [in their due season], and that we should have peace from our enemies, and that they should have faintness of heart so that a hundred of them flee before five, as a result of us observing the statutes and commandments of G-d, nor that everything should be the opposite [i.e., that none of these things should happen] because of us planting in the Seventh year [which we are forbidden to do]. But although they are hidden miracles, for they are [brought about] by means of the natural events of the world occurring according to their habit, yet [the Torah mentions them separately because] they come to be known [as miracles] because of their constant and continuous occurrence in the whole Land. For if one righteous man lives and G-d takes away sickness from him, and he lives out his days, this also happens to some wicked people [and is thus not acknowledged as miraculous]. But when an entire land and a whole people always have rains coming in their season, and plenitude, security, peace, health, strength and defeat of their enemies, in a manner unparalleled in the whole world, it becomes known to all that <italic>this is the Eternal&#x2019;s doing</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2779">47</xref></sup> Therefore He said [in connection with these blessings], <italic>And all the peoples shall see that the Name of the Eternal is called upon thee, and they shall be afraid of thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2780">48</xref></sup> And the opposite of this will occur because of the curses, when punishments will come upon the [whole] Land, just as He said, <italic>and I will make your heaven as iron</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2781">49</xref></sup> and punishments of sickness, as He said, <italic>and sore sickness, and of long continuance</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2782">50</xref></sup> meaning that the food will be spoiled and bring about sickness, and thus the miracle will be made known to all because of its continued existence amongst the whole people. Therefore it is written, <italic>And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say when they see the plagues of that Land, and its sicknesses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2783">51</xref></sup> For they will not wonder at that [single] man upon whom <italic>all the curse that is written in this book shall lie</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2784">52</xref></sup> for it happens many times in the natural order of the world, among all nations, that bad happenings come upon a certain individual. It is only with reference to <italic>that Land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2783">51</xref></sup> that they will wonder, and that all the nations will ask, <italic>Wherefore hath the Eternal done thus unto this Land?</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2785">53</xref></sup> for all will see and understand <italic>that the hand of the Eternal hath done this</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2786">54</xref></sup> And [by way of reply] they will say, <italic>Because they forsook the covenant of the Eternal, the G-d of their fathers</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2787">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>In general then, when Israel is in perfect [accord with G-d], constituting a large number, their affairs are not conducted at all by the natural order of things, neither in connection with themselves, nor with reference to their Land, neither collectively nor individually, for G-d blesses their bread and their water, and removes sickness from their midst, so that they do not need a physician and do not have to observe any of the rules of medicine, just as He said, <italic>for I am the Eternal that healeth thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2788">56</xref></sup> And so did the righteous ones act at the time when prophecy [existed], so that even if a mishap of iniquity overtook them, causing them sickness, they did not turn to the physicians, but only to the prophets, as was the case with Hezekiah when he was sick.<sup><xref rid="fn2789">57</xref></sup> And Scripture states [of Asa, king of Judah, by way of rebuke], <italic>Yet in his disease he sought not to the Eternal, but to the physicians</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2790">58</xref></sup> Now had the practice of [consulting] physicians been customary among them, why should the verse mention [as a sinful act Asa&#x2019;s consulting] the physicians, since his guilt was only because he did not [also] seek G-d? But the verse can be compared to someone saying: &#x201C;That person did not eat unleavened bread on the Festival of Passover, but instead [ate] leavened bread.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2791">59</xref></sup> For he who seeks the Eternal through a prophet, will not consult the physicians. And what part do the physicians have in the house of those who do the will of G-d, after He has assured us, <italic>and He will bless thy bread, and thy water, and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2771">39</xref></sup> whereas the physicians are concerned [mostly] with food and drink, warning [the patient] against [eating] certain foods and commanding him [to eat] others.<sup><xref rid="fn2792">60</xref></sup> Thus also the Rabbis said:<sup><xref rid="fn2793">61</xref></sup> &#x201C;During all the twenty-two years that Rabbah reigned [as head of the Academy at Pumbeditha], Rav Yoseph did not call even a blood letter to his house&#x201D; [as he, being a righteous person, was protected directly by G-d and needed no physicians], and they also say by way of proverb:<sup><xref rid="fn2794">62</xref></sup> &#x201C;A gate which is not open for the commandments [i.e., a house wherein the commandments are not observed] is open for the physician.&#x201D; This is also the meaning of their saying:<sup><xref rid="fn2795">63</xref></sup> &#x201C;People should not have to take medicaments, but they have become accustomed to do so.&#x201D; [That is to say]: had they not accustomed themselves to [taking] medicines, people would become sick according to the degree of punishment corresponding to their sin, and would be healed by the will of G-d, but since they accustomed themselves to medicaments, G-d has left them to natural happenings. This is also the intent of the Rabbis&#x2019; interpretation:<sup><xref rid="fn2796">64</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And he shall cause him to be thoroughly healed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2797">65</xref></sup> From here [you deduce the principle] that permission has been given to the physician to heal.&#x201D; They did not say that &#x201C;permission was given to the sick to be healed&#x201D; [by the physician], but instead they stated [by implication] that since the person who became sick comes [to the physician] to be healed, because he has accustomed himself to seeking medical help and <italic>he was not of the congregation of</italic> the Eternal <italic>whose portion is in this life</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2798">66</xref></sup> the physician should not refrain from healing him; whether because of fear that he might die under his hand, since he is qualified in this profession, or because he says that it is G-d alone Who is the Healer of all flesh, since [after all] people have already accustomed themselves [to seeking such help]. Therefore when men contend and one smites the other <italic>with a stone or his fist</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2799">67</xref></sup> the one who smote must pay for the healing,<sup><xref rid="fn2797">65</xref></sup> for the Torah does not base its laws upon miracles, just as it said, <italic>for the poor shall never cease out of the Land</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2800">68</xref></sup> knowing [beforehand] that such will be the case. But <italic>when a man&#x2019;s ways please the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2801">69</xref></sup> he need have no concern with physicians.</p>
<p>12. AND I WILL WALK AMONG YOU. This means that My conduct with you will be well-known, as when a monarch walks in the midst of his army, supplying them with all their needs.</p>
<p>This then is the way of the simple sense of the words of the covenant, and it is true, for so indeed will He do with them. Now Scripture did not mention here the reward of the existence of the souls in the World of Souls,<sup><xref rid="fn2802">70</xref></sup> and in the World to Come after the resurrection, for their existence [following the death of the body] is a matter of necessity in the way of creation, as I have explained in [the section on] excisions,<sup><xref rid="fn2803">71</xref></sup> this form of punishment being the &#x201C;cutting off&#x201D; of the guilty ones [from life eternal], and all the other [souls] will continue to exist on account of their fundamental nature inherent in their creation. But by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], these blessings [in this section] are also heavenly blessings in matters above, as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2804">72</xref></sup> Thus, <italic>And I will give peace in the Land;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2805">73</xref></sup> <italic>and My soul shall not abhor you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2804">72</xref></sup> and similarly, <italic>and I will walk among you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2806">74</xref></sup> allude to the [Divine] attribute which our Rabbis have called <italic>Shechinah</italic> (the Divine Presence), of [the root found in the expression], <italic>And I will set &#x2018;mishkani&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>My dwelling</italic>) <italic>among you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2804">72</xref></sup> and as the Rabbis say:<sup><xref rid="fn2807">75</xref></sup> &#x201C;The <italic>Shechinah</italic> (Divine Presence) dwells with Israel.&#x201D; And in Bereshith Rabbah they have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2808">76</xref></sup> &#x201C;The Divine Presence was mainly in the lower world.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2809">77</xref></sup> Thus the Garden of Eden [i.e., the World of Souls] and the World to Come [after the resurrection] are mentioned here<sup><xref rid="fn2810">78</xref></sup> to those who know [the way of Truth].</p>
<p>Now these blessings in their perfection will only occur when all Israel do the will of their Father [in heaven], and when [as a result of this] the structure of heaven and earth will be perfect, in accordance with its [original] plan. There are no other blessings in the Torah as perfect as these, which constitute the words of the covenant and the conditions between the Holy One, blessed be He, and us.</p>
<p>Know, [however], that Israel never attained these blessings in their perfection, neither many of them [i.e., as a people] nor as individuals, since their merits were never sufficient for them, just as the Rabbis have said with reference to David&#x2019;s [captains]:<sup><xref rid="fn2811">79</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And he</italic> [Adino the Eznite] <italic>lifted up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2812">80</xref></sup> But he [David] was troubled about the [remaining] two hundred.<sup><xref rid="fn2813">81</xref></sup> Thereupon a Divine Voice came forth and said to him, <italic>Save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2814">82</xref></sup> Therefore you will find our Rabbis of blessed memory speaking of [the fulfillment of] these verses [containing the blessings] in the future [which is yet] to come. [Thus they have said].<sup><xref rid="fn2815">83</xref></sup> &#x201C;This teaches that a child of Israel will in the future stretch forth [his hand into the pupil of an adder&#x2019;s eye, and remove his gall through his mouth.&#x201D; Similarly they have said]:<sup><xref rid="fn2816">84</xref></sup> &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He, will in the future walk about with the righteous in the World to Come.&#x201D; This is because [these blessings] have not yet been fulfilled, but they will be fulfilled for us at the time of [our] perfection.</p>
<p>15. AND IF YE SHALL REJECT MY STATUTES. Because &#x201C;statutes&#x201D; are commandments the reasons for which have not been revealed to the majority of the people,<sup><xref rid="fn2817">85</xref></sup> therefore fools reject them, saying: &#x201C;Why does G-d desire that I should not wear this garment which is woven with threads of linen and of blue wool?<sup><xref rid="fn2818">86</xref></sup> And how do we benefit by burning the [Red] Heifer, and sprinkling upon us the ashes thereof?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2819">87</xref></sup> The &#x201C;ordinances,&#x201D; however, everyone desires and everyone needs, for there can be no civilized life for any people or country without ordinances. No one will reject the ordinances of: <italic>he that smiteth a man so that he dieth;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2820">88</xref></sup> <italic>and if men strive together;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2821">89</xref></sup> and the laws of the ox and the pit<sup><xref rid="fn2822">90</xref></sup> and the [four] guardians,<sup><xref rid="fn2823">91</xref></sup> and so on. However, the judgment that we execute upon those who transgress the commandments, such as one who has forbidden sexual intercourse, or profanes the Sabbath, or does [the sorcery of] the <italic>ov</italic> or <italic>yid&#x2019;oni</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2824">92</xref></sup> they will despise, because of [the necessity of keeping these] commandments, which constitute a heavy yoke upon the wicked. Therefore He said, <italic>and if your soul abhor Mine ordinances so that ye will not do all My commandments</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2825">93</xref></sup> for their abhorrence of the &#x201C;ordinances&#x201D; is in order that they should not keep the commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn2826">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT YE MAKE VOID MY COVENANT. [This means that they desire] that the covenant be completely voided so that they will thus be without Torah, in order to permit themselves openly forbidden sexual intercourse, and every desire which is sweet to their soul.<sup><xref rid="fn2827">95</xref></sup> By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the verse means that this covenant will be made void and annulled, [this being] the opposite of [the Divine assurance], <italic>and I will give peace in the Land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2805">73</xref></sup> It is with reference to this that He said, <italic>forasmuch as they voided My covenant, although I ruled over them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2828">96</xref></sup> [meaning that] &#x201C;because they annulled <italic>My covenant of peace</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2829">97</xref></sup> <italic>I</italic> Myself <italic>ruled over them</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2830">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. &#x2018;APH ANI E&#x2019;ESEH ZOTH LACHEM&#x2019; (ALSO I WILL DO THIS UNTO YOU). By way of the Truth, the meaning [of this verse is] as if it were inverted: <italic>&#x2018;aph ani zoth e&#x2019;eseh lachem&#x2019;</italic> [meaning: &#x201C;also <italic>ani</italic> &#x2014; the term for the Divine attribute called <italic>zoth</italic>, which signifies judgment &#x2014; will do unto you&#x201D;]. This is why He always mentions in this section the word <italic>ani</italic> (I): <italic>then will &#x2018;ani&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>I</italic>) <italic>also walk;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2831">99</xref></sup> <italic>And &#x2018;ani&#x2019;</italic> (I) <italic>also will smite you;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2831">99</xref></sup> <italic>and &#x2018;ani&#x2019;</italic> (I) <italic>also will chastise you;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2832">100</xref></sup> <italic>and &#x2018;ani</italic> (I) <italic>will bring the Land into desolation;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2833">101</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;ani&#x2019;</italic> (I) <italic>also will walk contrary unto them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2834">102</xref></sup> And in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah [we find it interpreted]:<sup><xref rid="fn2835">103</xref></sup> &#x201C;It will not suffice for Me [merely] to pronounce judgment [and have it executed by a messenger], but <italic>even I also</italic> will chastise [you], etc.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The principle [of this section] is that it is the Holy One, blessed be He, Who makes this covenant, and this is the meaning of the expressions: <italic>seven for your sins;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2836">104</xref></sup> <italic>seven according to your sins</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2837">105</xref></sup> And the oaths are [thus] the oaths of the covenant, for the expressions are from the mouth of the Almighty, [speaking] in the language of the first person: <italic>&#x2018;I&#x2019; will do;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2838">106</xref></sup> <italic>and &#x2018;I&#x2019; will chastise;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2832">100</xref></sup> <italic>and &#x2018;I&#x2019; will smite</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2831">99</xref></sup> Therefore Scripture states [concerning this covenant], <italic>which the Eternal made between Him and the children of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2839">107</xref></sup> for He by His Great Name made this covenant. But in the Book of Deuteronomy [Scripture] states, <italic>If thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Eternal thy G-d, to observe to do all His commandments</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2840">108</xref></sup> and it continually mentions there an expression of cursing, thus it starts them [the words of the covenant] with: <italic>cursed shalt thou be</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2841">109</xref></sup> since the blessing is absent from them, and it further states, <italic>the Eternal will make</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2842">110</xref></sup> It is this which is the [intention of the] saying of our Rabbis:<sup><xref rid="fn2843">111</xref></sup> &#x201C;The imprecations of the Book of Leviticus were [prounounced] in plural terms [<italic>if &#x2018;ye&#x2019; will not hearken &#x2026; if &#x2018;ye&#x2019; shall reject &#x2026;</italic>], and Moses, in saying them, said them from the mouth of the Almighty [stating: &#x201C;Thus did the Holy One blessed be He, say unto me, <italic>&#x2018;If ye will not hearken unto Me&#x2019;</italic> &#x201D;], but those [imprecations mentioned] in the Book of Deuteronomy were [pronounced] in the singular [<italic>if &#x2018;thou&#x2019; wilt not hearken &#x2026; which I command &#x2018;thee&#x2019;&#x2026;</italic>] and Moses in saying them said them [as though they came] from his own mouth, for the Almighty made Moses a messenger between Him and between all Israel.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Know and understand that these oaths [stated in this section] allude to the first exile [i.e., the Babylonian exile following the destruction of the First Temple], for it is with reference to the First Temple that all the words of this covenant, concerning the exile and the redemption therefrom, apply. For thus you will see in the exhortations [here] that He stated, <italic>And if ye shall reject My statutes, and if your soul abhor Mine ordinances</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2844">112</xref></sup> and He further stated, <italic>that ye void My covenant</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2844">112</xref></sup> mentioning among them [the rejected statutes]: the high places [on which they offered forbidden sacrifices], sun-images, and idols,<sup><xref rid="fn2845">113</xref></sup> and it was [in the times of the First Temple] that they worshipped idols and did all evil things. It is in connection with this that He said, <italic>And I will bring your Sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2846">114</xref></sup> thus warning them that He will remove from them His Sanctuary and the acceptance of the offerings which were favorable to Him in that Sanctuary, and the punishments which were to follow upon them were: the sword,<sup><xref rid="fn2847">115</xref></sup> wild beasts,<sup><xref rid="fn2848">116</xref></sup> pestilence,<sup><xref rid="fn2847">115</xref></sup> famine,<sup><xref rid="fn2849">117</xref></sup> and finally exile.<sup><xref rid="fn2850">118</xref></sup> And all these things occurred then [at the destruction of the First Temple], as is clearly stated in the Book of Jeremiah. Of that [first] exile He stated, <italic>Then shall the Land be paid her Sabbaths;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2851">119</xref></sup> <italic>As long as it lieth desolate it shall have a rest; even the rest which it had not</italic> [<italic>in your Sabbath</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn2852">120</xref></sup> because the years of the [Babylonian] exile were [as many] as the years in which they failed to observe [the laws of] the Sabbatical years.<sup><xref rid="fn2853">121</xref></sup> So also does Scripture state concerning that exile, [that it was] <italic>To fulfill the word of the Eternal by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the Land had been paid her Sabbaths; for as long as she lay desolate she kept Sabbath, to fulfill threescore and ten years</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2854">122</xref></sup> Thus He warned them and thus it happened to them. If so, it is clear that Scripture speaks here of that [first] exile.</p>
<p>If you examine further the subject of the redemption from it [the Babylonian exile, you see], that He only assures [Israel] that He will remember the covenant of the fathers,<sup><xref rid="fn2855">123</xref></sup> and of the remembrance of the Land,<sup><xref rid="fn2855">123</xref></sup> but not that He will forgive their iniquity and their sin and that He will once again love them as of old, nor that He will gather together those of them who are dispersed. For such indeed happened when they came up from Babylon, for only [the tribes of] Judah and Benjamin returned together with a small group of Levites who were with them, and some<sup><xref rid="fn2856">124</xref></sup> of the [other] tribes that had been exiled to Babylon, and they returned in poverty, and in servitude to the kings of Persia.<sup><xref rid="fn2857">125</xref></sup> Nor does He state that they will return to Him in complete repentance, but only that <italic>they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2858">126</xref></sup> and we find that the people of the Second Temple did so, as Daniel confessed: <italic>We have sinned, we have dealt iniquitously, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, and have turned aside from Thy commandments</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2859">127</xref></sup> <italic>O Eternal, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2860">128</xref></sup> And it is further written, <italic>because of our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Thy people are a reproach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2861">129</xref></sup> And so did Nehemiah confess.<sup><xref rid="fn2862">130</xref></sup> And Ezra said, <italic>Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept Thy law</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2863">131</xref></sup> Thus they all deduced from the Torah that they should confess their iniquity and [also] the iniquity of their fathers. All these [matters] are clear indications that this covenant does indeed allude to the first exile and the redemption therefrom.</p>
<p>However the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy<sup><xref rid="fn2864">132</xref></sup> alludes to this our [present] exile, and to the redemption by which we will be redeemed from it. Thus we observe first that there [in the second covenant] neither the end nor the duration [of the exile] are alluded to, and that He did not assure us of redemption [i.e., promising that it would take place at a certain future time as was the case with the Babylonian captivity, whose end was foretold as a definite event in our section here in Leviticus as explained above], but He made it dependent upon [our] repentance. Neither did He mention among the sins [for which they would be exiled that] they would make any Asherim and sun-images, or that they would worship any idols whatsoever. Rather, He said, <italic>But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Eternal thy G-d, to observe to do all His commandments and His statutes</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2840">108</xref></sup> thus stating that because they will transgress some of His commandments, and will not keep and observe all of them,<sup><xref rid="fn2865">133</xref></sup> they would be punished. Such indeed was the case during the Second Temple, just as the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2866">134</xref></sup> &#x201C;Why was the First Temple destroyed? Because of idolatry, immorality and bloodshed. But the Second Temple, of which we know that they [the people of that period], were engaged in the study of Torah and the practice of loving kindness, why was it destroyed? It was because of the causeless enmity which was among them.&#x201D; Neither does He mention there [in the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy] the Sanctuary, or &#x201C;the pleasing odor&#x201D; [of the offerings], as He mentioned here,<sup><xref rid="fn2867">135</xref></sup> because the [Heavenly] fire did not come down and consume the offerings [that were brought] in the Second Temple, as the Rabbis testified there in Tractate Yoma.<sup><xref rid="fn2868">136</xref></sup> And He further states there among the imprecations, <italic>The Eternal will bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as the vulture swoops down</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2869">137</xref></sup> alluding to the coming upon them of the Romans, who were very far from them. Thus He states there, <italic>a nation that thou hast not known;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2870">138</xref></sup> <italic>a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2869">137</xref></sup> because of their great distance from our Land. Such is not the case concerning the words of this covenant [before us], for [it speaks of the time when] they were exiled to Babylon and Assyria, which are near to [our] Land, and they always warred with them;<sup><xref rid="fn2871">139</xref></sup> and the stock of Israel comes from there, and they [the Jews] knew their language, as it is said, <italic>Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Aramean language, for we understand it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2872">140</xref></sup> Similarly, the verse stating [there in the Book of Deuteronomy], <italic>And the Eternal shall scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth unto the other</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2873">141</xref></sup> is [a reference to] our exile today, in which we are scattered from one end of the world to the other. Again He stated [there], <italic>And the Eternal shall bring thee back into Egypt in ships</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2874">142</xref></sup> and this happened in our [present] exile, when Titus filled the ships with them [captives], as it is written in the books of the Romans.<sup><xref rid="fn2875">143</xref></sup> Similarly, that which Scripture says there, <italic>Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people and thy eyes shall see;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2876">144</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, and they shall not be thine, for they shall go into captivity</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2877">145</xref></sup> &#x2014; these are not references to the [Babylonian] exile, when both fathers and sons were exiled, but [refer] to that captivity of the sons alone [following the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans], when the fathers remained in the Land. Such is not stated in the first covenant, because the exile [which it speaks of] was a complete one [for both fathers and sons], but it is mentioned in the second covenant, because the Romans ruled in our Land and took the sons and daughters at their will. Similarly, [the verse stating], <italic>Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy whom the Eternal shall send against thee in hunger, and in thirst</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2878">146</xref></sup> is a reference to our servitude when we were subject to the Romans in our Land, and their officers ruled over us, pressing upon us a heavy yoke and taking away our people and our wealth, as is known in the [history] books. Another proof [that the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy refers to the exile after the destruction of the Second Temple] is that He said, <italic>The Eternal will bring thee, and thy king whom thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation that thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2879">147</xref></sup> for King Agrippa<sup><xref rid="fn2880">148</xref></sup> went to Rome at the end of the [period of the] Second Temple, and on account of his going there the Temple was destroyed.<sup><xref rid="fn2881">149</xref></sup> Now Scripture does not state: &#x201C;the king who will rule over thee,&#x201D; but it says, <italic>thy king whom &#x2018;thou shalt set&#x2019;</italic>. Thus He, blessed be He, is hinting to us that he [that ruler] was not fit to be king, since he was forbidden to be king over Israel according to the law of the Torah [as he was a descendant of King Herod, the son of Antipater the Idumean, and Scripture states, <italic>thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee, who is not thy brother</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn2882">150</xref></sup> but they &#x201C;set up&#x201D; him and his fathers as kings over them against the law, as is mentioned in Tractate Sotah.<sup><xref rid="fn2883">151</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now all the hints such as these clearly indicate that the meaning of this matter is this our [present] exile, and the redemption [mentioned] in this second covenant, which will be a complete redemption, superior to all [preceding ones]. Thus He said, <italic>And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse</italic> etc.;<sup><xref rid="fn2884">152</xref></sup> and He promised, <italic>And He will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2885">153</xref></sup> this being a promise to all the tribes of Israel, not [merely] to one-sixth<sup><xref rid="fn2886">154</xref></sup> of the people; and there He promised [also] that He would cut down and destroy those who caused our exile, as it is said, <italic>And the Eternal thy G-d will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2887">155</xref></sup> the expressions, <italic>thine enemies</italic> and <italic>those that hate thee</italic> alluding to the two nations<sup><xref rid="fn2888">156</xref></sup> that continually persecute us. Now these words [<italic>And He will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2885">153</xref></sup>] assure us of the coming redemption with a more perfect assurance than all the visions of Daniel.</p>
<p>Similarly, that which He stated here, <italic>and your enemies that shall dwell therein shall be desolate in it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2889">157</xref></sup> constitutes a good tiding, proclaiming that during all our exiles, our Land will not accept our enemies. This also is a great proof and assurance to us, for in the whole inhabited part of the world one cannot find such a <italic>good and large Land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2890">158</xref></sup> which was always lived in and yet is as ruined as it is [today],<sup><xref rid="fn2891">159</xref></sup> for since the time that we left it, it has not accepted any nation or people, and they all try to settle it, but to no avail.<sup><xref rid="fn2892">160</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the first covenant mentioned in this section the Holy One, blessed be He, made, for His Great Name was indeed with us in the First Temple, and the second covenant in the section of <italic>V&#x2019;hayah Ki Thavo</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2893">161</xref></sup> expressed by the mouth of Moses, alludes to the removal of his Divine Presence entirely, since in the Second Temple only the Glory of His Name was present, as it is said, <italic>and I will take pleasure in it</italic> i.e., the Second Temple] <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;ikavdah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and I will be glorified</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2894">162</xref></sup> The additional letter <italic>hei</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2895">163</xref></sup> alludes to the second <italic>hei</italic> in the Great Name [i.e., the Tetragrammaton &#x2014; which refers to the Glory of His Name].<sup><xref rid="fn2896">164</xref></sup> The Rabbis have also already interpreted this verse by means of another exposition,<sup><xref rid="fn2868">136</xref></sup> [that the missing <italic>hei</italic> in the word <italic>v&#x2019;ikavdah</italic>, whose numerical value is five], alludes to the five things which the Second Temple lacked etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2897">165</xref></sup></p>
<p>41. &#x2018;O&#x2019; (OR) THEN PERCHANCE THEIR UNCIRCUMCISED HEART BE HUMBLED. &#x201C;[The word <italic>o</italic> here has the same meaning] as in <italic>&#x2018;o&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>or</italic>) <italic>it is known that the ox was wont to gore</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2898">166</xref></sup> Another interpretation is [that the word <italic>o</italic> means] &#x2018;perhaps&#x2019; &#x2014; perhaps then their uncircumcised heart will be humbled; <italic>and they then be paid the punishment of their iniquity</italic>, meaning that they will achieve atonement for their iniquities through their sufferings.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. The correct interpretation appears to me to be that He is stating: &#x201C;<italic>And I will bring them into the land of their enemies, o</italic> (either) until such time when <italic>their uncircumcised heart will be humbled, o</italic> (or) until the time when <italic>they will have been paid the punishment of their iniquity</italic> by the length of the exile.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now it is after [the verse], <italic>and they shall confess their iniquity</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2899">167</xref></sup> that He should have said, <italic>Then will I remember My covenant with Jacob</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn2900">168</xref></sup> for what reason is there [to state here, between these two verses] <italic>and I will bring them into the lands of their enemies</italic>, since this is not a time when He would exile them and bring them into the lands of their enemies [since they have just confessed their sins]&#x0021; Therefore Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted [the verse to mean]: &#x201C;This also I did with them, that I punished them by bringing them into the land of their enemies in order to humble their uncircumcised heart.&#x201D; And He mentioned this here [in order to indicate] that they confessed their sin &#x201C;because it was I Who brought this about, for even at the time that they became corrupted, My intent was that they should repent and confess.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In my opinion He hints here [by placing the verses in this order] that [even] after the confession [of their sins], He will walk contrary to them and will still bring them into the land of their enemies until their uncircumcised heart is humbled, this being an allusion that He will bring them back into the Land but it will not be subdued before them; rather, they will have adversaries and enemies there, as it is said, <italic>And our adversaries said;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2901">169</xref></sup> <italic>And it came to pass when our enemies heard</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2902">170</xref></sup> The Land [at that time, when they returned from Babylon], was in the hands of foreign peoples, just as Ezra said in his prayer: <italic>Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the Land that Thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold we are servants in it. And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom Thou hast set over us because of our sins; also they have power over us, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2903">171</xref></sup></p>
<p>42. THEN WILL I REMEMBER MY COVENANT WITH JACOB. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that this [is a case where a word] draws along with itself another [similar] word, thus meaning: &#x201C;Then will I remember My covenant, the covenant with Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn2904">172</xref></sup> Similarly: <italic>the prophecy of Oded the prophet;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2905">173</xref></sup> <italic>your heads of your tribes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2906">174</xref></sup> <italic>And the Land I will remember</italic>. The meaning thereof is that I will remember the Land, and that it was paid its Sabbaths and lay forsaken without them, and I will remember that they have atoned for their iniquity.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is possible according to the way of Truth, [the mystic doctrines of the Cabala], that He is saying: &#x201C;And I will remember Jacob and Isaac and Abraham, who are the men of the covenant,&#x201D; for all attributes are so called when they are in the covenant; &#x201C;<italic>v&#x2019;ha&#x2019;aretz</italic> (and the earth),<sup><xref rid="fn2907">175</xref></sup> which is composed of them all, I will remember among them.&#x201D; Our Rabbis have so alluded. Thus they said:<sup><xref rid="fn2908">176</xref></sup> &#x201C;And why does He mention the merit of <italic>ha&#x2019;aretz</italic> with them? Said Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: This is like the case of a master who had three daughters, and one maidservant who raised them. Whenever the master asked about the welfare of his daughters, he would say: &#x2018;Ask on my behalf about the welfare of she who raises them.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p><italic>And the Land shall lie forsaken without them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2909">177</xref></sup> This means that even after the remembring [of the covenant and the Land] it shall lie forsaken without them, hinting that even after the decree of Cyrus<sup><xref rid="fn2910">178</xref></sup> [granting the Jews in Babylon permission to return and rebuild the Temple], the Land will still lie forsaken without them and her Sabbatical years, until nineteen years<sup><xref rid="fn2911">179</xref></sup> after the Temple was rebuilt; and then they sanctified the city [of Jerusalem] with two thanks-offerings,<sup><xref rid="fn2912">180</xref></sup> and the sanctity of the Land was restored,<sup><xref rid="fn2913">181</xref></sup> and they made the covenant,<sup><xref rid="fn2914">182</xref></sup> and declared [among other conditions] <italic>and that we would forego the Seventh year and the exaction of every debt</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2915">183</xref></sup> All events that happened to them [at the beginning of their return to the Land after the Babylonian exile] are alluded to in this section.</p>
<p>45. AND I WILL FOR THEIR SAKES REMEMBER THE COVENANT OF THEIR ANCESTORS. This means that I will remember it for their sakes whether in the Land or outside the Land, both in the [first] exile alluded to here and likewise throughout all generations. This is the sense of the expression <italic>in the sight of the nations</italic> [<italic>And I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors &#x2026; in the sight of the nations</italic>], for He will do [good] to them because of His Great Name, so that it be not profaned among the nations, but not for their sake, since they have not repented, and [thus] their iniquities have not been forgiven. And so did our Rabbis say:<sup><xref rid="fn2916">184</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>I will not reject them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2917">185</xref></sup> in the days of Vespasian.<sup><xref rid="fn2918">186</xref></sup> <italic>Neither will I abhor them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2917">185</xref></sup> in the days of Greece.<sup><xref rid="fn2919">187</xref></sup> [<italic>Neither will I abhor them</italic>] <italic>to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2917">185</xref></sup> in the days of Haman. <italic>For I am the Eternal their G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2917">185</xref></sup> in the days of Gog and Magog.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2920">188</xref></sup></p>
<h1>27</h1>
<p>1. AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING &#x2026; 2 &#x2026; WHEN A MAN SHALL CLEARLY UTTER A VOW. This section also is joined [to Chapter 25 above] as having been declared on Mount Sinai;<sup><xref rid="fn2921">189</xref></sup> and it is attached to the exhortations [in the preceding section] because it is concerned with the ordinances of the Jubilee, [and the exhortations speak also of the failure to keep the Jubilee], as He mentions in the case of a person who dedicates a field he has bought<sup><xref rid="fn2922">190</xref></sup> or a field of his inheritance;<sup><xref rid="fn2923">191</xref></sup> but He included here in one section the ordinances of all who vow [donations of any sort to the Sanctuary]. It is for this reason that He stated at the end, <italic>These are the commandments, which the Eternal commanded Moses for the children of Israel in Mount Sinai</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2924">192</xref></sup> [which refers to] all that has been said above, for from then on [i.e., in the Book of Numbers] He speaks of the commandments that were declared in the Tent of Meeting.</p>
<p>26. ONLY THE FIRSTBORN OF THE BEASTS &#x2026; NO MAN SHALL SANCTIFY IT &#x2014; &#x201C;as a different offering, because it is not his.&#x201D; Thus the language of Rashi. The correct interpretation is that He is saying: &#x201C;there is no need to sanctify it [the firstling], for <italic>whether it be ox or sheep, it is the Eternal&#x2019;s</italic> automatically.&#x201D; The verse is thus [to be understood] as a negation.<sup><xref rid="fn2925">193</xref></sup> And in the Book of Deuteronomy He stated, <italic>All the firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the Eternal thy G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2926">194</xref></sup> meaning that it is holy and that you are to treat it with holiness, so that you are not to do work with it, nor shear it,<sup><xref rid="fn2926">194</xref></sup> and that you are to <italic>eat it before the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2927">195</xref></sup> as He will explain.</p>
<p>27. AND IF IT BE AN ANIMAL FORBIDDEN TO BE EATEN [dedicated to the Temple], THEN HE SHALL RANSOM IT ACCORDING TO THY VALUATION. &#x201C;This verse does not refer to the firstling [mentioned in the preceding verse], because one cannot state about the firstling of a forbidden animal, <italic>then he shall ransom it according to thy valuation</italic> [since among all forbidden animals, only the firstborn of an ass has to be redeemed]. It cannot refer to [the firstling of] an ass, since the [animal given in] redemption of an ass is only a lamb<sup><xref rid="fn2928">196</xref></sup> [while here the animal is to be redeemed <italic>according to thy valuation</italic>, i.e., as you wish], and [moreover the lamb given in redemption of a firstling ass is a] gift to the priest, and is not given to the Temple treasury [as is stated here]. Rather, the verse refers to something dedicated to the Temple treasury [and is a continuation of Verse 11], for above [in Verse 11] He spoke about redeeming a [dedicated] animal which is fit to be eaten and which became blemished [thus disqualifying it as an offering], and here [in the verse before us] He speaks of a case where one dedicated for Temple repairs an animal which is not permitted to be eaten, [or offered up].&#x201D; Thus far the language of Rashi.</p>
<p>It is possible that we answer [Rashi&#x2019;s argument as to why this verse cannot be referring to the redemption of this firstling of an ass, and that we do interpret it as referring to such a case, by saying] that because He stated [in the preceding verse], <italic>Only the firstborn of the beasts, which is born as a firstling to the Eternal, no man shall sanctify it</italic>, therefore He reverted [to this subject] and stated [in the verse before us] that if the firstling that he sanctified be of an animal that is forbidden to be eaten, <italic>then he shall ransom it according to thy valuation</italic>, explaining that [the law of] the firstling does not apply to forbidden animals, except for the firstling of an ass, the law of which has already been explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2928">196</xref></sup> Thus He taught [here] that even if a person did dedicate it, its sanctity is not like that of the law of a [permitted] firstling [which can never be redeemed], but it is like anything else which is dedicated to the Temple treasury, and it may be redeemed. Therefore He stated [here] that he who dedicated it redeems it by adding one-fifth [to its actual value], whereas another person may redeem it <italic>according to thy valuation</italic> [without the additional one-fifth]. And the verse above [11] stating, <italic>And if it be any unclean beast, of which they may not bring an offering</italic>, refers, according to the plain meaning of Scripture, to an animal that may not be eaten [not to the firstling of an ass, which has been dedicated to the Temple treasury]. According to the interpretation of our Rabbis,<sup><xref rid="fn2929">197</xref></sup> there is a redundant expression in that verse [11 above], since He repeated <italic>an unclean beast, of which they may not bring an offering to the Eternal</italic> [it being self-understood that an offering may not be brought from an animal that may not be eaten]. Therefore the Rabbis interpreted it as follows: &#x201C;<italic>and if it be any unclean beast</italic>, or [if it be] <italic>of which they may not bring an offering unto the Eternal</italic>,&#x201D; thus including [permitted] animals which have become permanently blemished, of which offerings may not be brought [and thus if they were dedicated to the Temple treasury, the law stated in the verse is to be applied].</p>
<p>29. NONE DOOMED WHO SHALL BE DOOMED OF MAN, SHALL BE REDEEMED. &#x201C;[This means that] if a person is about to be executed [by the court], and someone else says, &#x2018;I take upon myself to pay his valuation [to the Temple treasury],&#x2019; his vow is of no effect.&#x201D; HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH. &#x201C;For you see he is going to die. Therefore he is not to be redeemed; he has neither a market-price nor a fixed valuation&#x201D; [as fixed by the Torah on the basis of his age]. This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But our Rabbis have differed on this matter, some saying<sup><xref rid="fn2930">198</xref></sup> that it constitutes an admonition in connection with those who are liable to the death-penalty, that one must not take a ransom from them in order to free them. It is possible that He mentions this admonition here in order to state that he [the condemned] cannot give money to [the Temple of] G-d as other devoted things [are given], and thereby go free of punishment.</p>
<p>By way of the plain meaning of Scripture, the verse is stating that whatever a man devotes of his belongings, whether man or animal or field of his possession, <italic>it is holy unto the Eternal</italic>, meaning that they become devoted things of the priests, and there is no redemption for them. But if he devotes people who are not his, such as those who go to war against their enemies and utter a vow, <italic>If Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then will I utterly destroy their cities</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2931">199</xref></sup> then all the people found in them are to die. The reason for this is that the intention of those making such a vow is not that [the captives] be given to the priests, but rather that it be forbidden to derive any benefit from them, since their purpose is to utterly destroy the enemies. Thus we find in the case of the men of Jabesh-gilead who transgressed the oath of the assembly by not coming to Mitzpah [to take part in the battle against Gibeah for the outrage they had committed],<sup><xref rid="fn2932">200</xref></sup> that it is written, <italic>And the congregation sent thither ten thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them saying: &#x2018;Go and smite the inhabitants with the edge of the sword&#x2019;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2933">201</xref></sup> And common sense does not allow [us to say] that the whole congregation perpetrated such an evil deed, killing many people of Israel who were not guilty of death&#x0021; And Phinehas was there,<sup><xref rid="fn2934">202</xref></sup> and by word of his mouth the whole affair was done&#x0021; I have further found in the Agadah, in the [Midrash] Yelamdeinu:<sup><xref rid="fn2935">203</xref></sup> &#x201C;We have been taught: Rabbi Akiba says, <italic>Cheirem</italic> (&#x2018;doomed to destruction&#x2019;) is an oath, and an oath is <italic>cheirem</italic>. The men of Jabesh transgressed the <italic>cheirem</italic>, and thus they became liable to the death penalty.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Therefore I say that it was from this verse [before us] that they deduced this law &#x2014; that if any king of Israel, or the Great Sanhedrin [of seventy-one judges] in the presence of all Israel, who have the authority to institute ordinances [for the good of the people], if they declare a certain city <italic>cheirem</italic>, to be warred on, and likewise if they declare a certain matter <italic>cheirem</italic>, he who violates it is liable to the death-penalty. This indeed was the guilt of the men of Jabesh-gilead [as mentioned above], and of Jonathan, to whom his father [Saul] had said, <italic>&#x2018;G-d do so and more also, thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2936">204</xref></sup> Now on the basis of what legal authority did these people deserve death, if not because of this source [in Scripture]?</p>
<p>And this was the mistake that Jephthah made with his daughter.<sup><xref rid="fn2937">205</xref></sup> For he thought that just as a <italic>cheirem</italic> [&#x201C;doomed&#x201D; object] of the chief of Israel is valid and takes effect to put [certain] people to death, and [also] anyone who transgresses it is liable to the death-penalty, so [Jephthah thought] that if he uttered a vow at a time of war, to make an offering of a certain person or persons, the vow is valid; but he did not know that a <italic>cheirem</italic> declared by the king and Sanhedrin is valid [only] regarding the destruction of rebels, or against one who transgresses their decrees and ordinances. But that a vow should take effect to make a burnt-offering of something not appropriate for G-d, [as Jephthah thought] &#x2014; Heaven forbid&#x0021; Therefore the Rabbis have said in Bereshith Rabbah<sup><xref rid="fn2938">206</xref></sup> that [Jephthah] was not even obliged to pay the price of her market-value to the Temple treasury [as his vow was totally invalid], and he was punished for her [innocent] blood&#x0021;</p>
<p>Now do not let yourself be misled by Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra&#x2019;s<sup><xref rid="fn2939">207</xref></sup> empty words, when he says that the meaning of the expression <italic>and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2940">208</xref></sup> is &#x201C;or I will offer it up,&#x201D; as if to say: &#x201C;if that which comes forth of the doors of my house be a man or woman, that person shall be holy to G-d, inasmuch as he will abstain from the ways of the world, <italic>to stand to minister in the Name of the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2941">209</xref></sup> in prayer and thanksgiving to G-d; but if it be something fit for an offering, I will make it a burnt-offering.&#x201D; Accordingly [Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s interpretation continues, since Jephthah&#x2019;s daughter was the first to come out to meet her father], he built her a house outside the city where she resided in seclusion, and he provided her with sustenance all her days, <italic>and no man knew her</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2942">210</xref></sup> so that his daughter remained shut away [from the world all her life].</p>
<p>All this are words of emptiness. For if he vowed that [whatsoever comes forth of the door of his house] <italic>shall be the Eternal&#x2019;s</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2940">208</xref></sup> this does not mean that he should be a recluse [from the world], but instead he is to be like Samuel, of whom his mother said, <italic>and I shall give him unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2943">211</xref></sup> and he was a servant in the House of G-d, not a recluse. And according to the ordinances of the Torah, no man can utter a vow which will bind the persons who come out of the door of his house to live thereafter in seclusion, just as he cannot bring them as an offering. And if the matter be so [as Ibn Ezra put it] then Jephthah&#x2019;s daughter would be bewailing her virginity with her companions with her,<sup><xref rid="fn2944">212</xref></sup> like harlots enhancing their hire&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn2945">213</xref></sup> Heaven forbid that this be a custom in Israel, <italic>to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2946">214</xref></sup> because she did not marry and she worshipped G-d in purity&#x0021; Rather, this whole subject is to be understood in its plain meaning [that Jephthah actually brought her as an offering], and his mistake was as I have explained.</p>
<p>And according to the opinion of our Rabbis, of blessed memory, it is possible that this verse [before us] includes many [different] subjects, similar to the verse, <italic>Ye shall not eat with the blood;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2947">215</xref></sup> and like the verse, <italic>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2948">216</xref></sup> which the Rabbis interpret<sup><xref rid="fn2949">217</xref></sup> as invalidating the testimony of relatives, and Scripture further states concerning it: <italic>But the children of the murderers he</italic> [King Amaziah of Judah] <italic>put not to death, according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as the Eternal commanded, saying, &#x2018;The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2950">218</xref></sup> Similarly this verse [before us] includes the law of one who vows to give to the Temple treasury the valuation of a person who is liable to the death-penalty [as explained above], the law of those against whom a <italic>cheirem</italic> is declared at a time of conquest, as we have said, and the law of one who transgresses the <italic>cheirem</italic> of the Great Court or of the king of Israel, as was the case in the incident of Saul [and Jonathan mentioned above]. It is with reference to that that it is said there, <italic>So the people rescued Jonathan, that he die not</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2951">219</xref></sup> for since the Torah states, <italic>he shall not be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2952">220</xref></sup> it says there, <italic>So the people rescued Jonathan, that he die not;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2951">219</xref></sup> [meaning] that since a miracle happened through him [i.e., that the Philistines suffered a great defeat on that day], they knew that it was in error that Jonathan had acted [contrary to the <italic>cheirem</italic> of his father]. And this is the sense of the expression [of the people in speaking on behalf of Jonathan], <italic>who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2951">219</xref></sup> And so likewise did Yonathan ben Uziel translate this expression: &#x201C;For before the Eternal it is revealed that he [Jonathan] acted in error on that day, and so the people rescued Jonathan.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thus is completed the Book of the Law of the Priests [i.e., the Book of Leviticus], their offerings and their commandments.</p>
<p>May G-d the Most High restore matters to their [former] condition, the Levites to their song, the priests to their ministry, and Israel to their mighty habitation.</p>
<p>And may our eyes behold Jerusalem, the garden of the Palace;<sup><xref rid="fn2953">221</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>And the Palace upon its wonted place</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2954">222</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Temple and the Innermost Sanctuary upon their firm foundation, and <italic>the daughters of Judah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2955">223</xref></sup> in their security.</p>
<p><italic>Then will the offering of Judah be pleasant unto the Eternal as in the days of old</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2956">224</xref></sup> and as in their ancient years.</p>
<p>And acceptable upon His altar will be the Daily Whole-offerings in their order and the Additional Offerings according to their law.</p>
<p>Finished and completed is the Book of Leviticus with the help of G-d.</p>

<ftnote id="fn2792">(60) Rambam writes in a similar vein: &#x201C;Most maladies that afflict people are the result of bad food, or of overeating even wholesome food&#x201D; (Mishneh Torah, <italic>Hilchoth Dei&#x2019;oth</italic> 4:15).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2793">(61) Horayoth 14 a. To understand the full significance of this Talmudic statement about Rav Yoseph, and especially about Rabbah&#x2019;s connection with it [&#x201C;During all the twenty-two years that Rabbah reigned &#x2026;&#x201D;] it is necessary to know the background of a certain event that transpired in their lives. When the post of chief of the Academy of Pumbeditha became vacant the Rabbis of Babylon were in doubt as to whom they should appoint &#x2014; Rabbah or Rav Yoseph. Rabbah&#x2019;s distinction was that he was the outstanding dialectician of his generation, while that of Rav Yoseph was that he was the greatest erudite scholar. When an inquiry was made of the Rabbis in the Land of Israel the answer came back: &#x201C;An erudite scholar is preferable.&#x201D; It was thus Rav Yoseph&#x2019;s turn to become the head of the Academy. Yet in his humility Rav Yoseph refused to accept the post and insisted that Rabbah should reign. And thus for twenty-two years Rabbah continued to rule over the Academy of Pumbeditha. In recompense for his humility, the Talmudic story continues, Heaven rewarded Rav Yoseph that &#x201C;During all the twenty-two years that Rabbah reigned Rav Yoseph did not call even a bloodletter to his house,&#x201D; as was customary in those days, for his health was in such perfect condition. &#x2014; See in Ein Ya&#x2019;akov at end of Horayoth, in the commentary Hakotheiv, at end, for source of this beautiful interpretation. It expresses no doubt the intent of Ramban&#x2019;s words here before us.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2855">(123) Verse 42.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2856">(124) See Ramban&#x2019;s Sefer Hage&#x2019;ulah (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, pp. 272-4) for a full discussion of this important matter &#x2014; that in the return from Babylon there were small groups from the other tribes besides Judah and Benjamin, but the main bulk of them remained in their places, and hence the words of the prophets announcing their complete return, not having been fulfilled during the Second Temple, will yet assuredly come to transpire in the future. This is the deeper significance of Ramban&#x2019;s expression here: &#x201C;and <italic>some</italic> of the other tribes &#x2026;&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x201C;some&#x201D; but not all, and therefore the words of G-d as spoken by His prophets will still be fulfilled in the future when the <italic>ge&#x2019;ulah shleimah</italic> (the perfect redemption) will take place, as the return from Babylon did not represent that final and complete redemption. It is obvious that this constitutes a major principle in our faith of Israel&#x2019;s future and destiny. Ramban will touch upon this theme of the perfect redemption further on in the text. See also further, Note 154.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2857">(125) See Ezra 9:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2858">(126) Verse 40.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2859">(127) Daniel 9:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2860">(128) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 8. Thus they confessed also the sins of their fathers. The same applies to the following verses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2861">(129) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2862">(130) Nehemiah 1:6-7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2863">(131) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 9:34. It should be noted that Scripture there ascribes the actual confession to the Levites, and Ezra&#x2019;s name is not directly mentioned. However, the implication in Chapter 8 Verse 13 is clearly that it was at Ezra&#x2019;s instigation that they kept the Festival of Tabernacles and the subsequent confession following it (see <italic>ibid.</italic>, 9:1). Besides, Ezra being a priest (<italic>ibid.</italic>, 8:2) he was automatically of the tribe of Levi and was thus included among the Levites who recited the confession.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2864">(132) Deuteronomy 28:1-69.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2865">(133) I.e., they will &#x201C;transgress&#x201D; some of the negative commandments and &#x201C;not keep and observe&#x201D; the positive commandments.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2869">(137) Deuteronomy 28:49.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2870">(138) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2871">(139) Therefore, the verse in Deuteronomy 28:49 [<italic>The Eternal will bring a nation &#x2026; from the end of the earth &#x2026;</italic>] could not apply to the period of the First Temple, as their warring enemies were nearby. The case was far different during the Second Temple when the Romans came from far-off Italy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2872">(140) II Kings 18:26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2873">(141) Deuteronomy 28:64.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2874">(142) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 68.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2875">(143) Reference is to the book of Josippon, Chapter 95. See Vol. I, p. 604, Note 249.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2876">(144) Deuteronomy 28:32.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2877">(145) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 41. Ramban&#x2019;s illuminating comment on these verses (see following text) brings to light the ruthless cruelty of the Romans at the destruction of the Second Temple, when they deported all the young and only &#x201C;the fathers [i.e. the old] remained in the Land.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2878">(146) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 48.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2879">(147) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2880">(148) This was Agrippa II, a loyal servant of Rome. He was the last king of Judea. During the siege of Jerusalem he was with Titus, and following the fall of the city he took part in arranging the Roman triumphal celebrations in Caesarea&#x0021; He was the opposite of his father King Agrippa I, who in his genuine attachment to the Jewish people and religion won the love of all classes of the people.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2881">(149) Ramban here is referring to Josippon Chapter 65, where it is narrated that &#x201C;King Agrippa went to Nero, emperor of Rome, and told him all these things [concerning the Jewish uprising against Rome], whereupon Nero sent against the Jews the Roman general etc.&#x201D; This was the beginning of the war which culminated in the fall of Jerusalem.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2882">(150) Deuteronomy 17:15.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2884">(152) Deuteronomy 30:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2885">(153) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2886">(154) I.e., the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which constitute one-sixth of the twelve tribes. Ramban is thus stating that the redemption from the Babylonian exile was not a complete redemption, since the return consisted mainly of two tribes [with small groups of the other tribes, see above Note 124]. But the Divine promise stated in Deuteronomy 30:5 [as mentioned here in the text] refers to <italic>all</italic> tribes of Israel. Hence the coming redemption will be more complete than all preceding ones.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2887">(155) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2888">(156) A reference to the two dominant religions in Ramban&#x2019;s times &#x2014; that of Edom and Ishmael &#x2014; which persecuted the Jews [and still continue to do so] in countless ways. See my Hebrew commentary p. 190.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2889">(157) Further, Verse 32.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2890">(158) Exodus 3:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2891">(159) When these words were written &#x2014; sometime after the middle of the thirteenth century &#x2014; the Land of Israel had just experienced the Mongolian invasion (of 1259-60), which following upon the constant wars of the Crusaders, left the country in total ruin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2892">(160) A clear reference to the many nations that have tried &#x2014; and failed &#x2014; to cultivate the Land of Israel since the Jews were driven from it by the Romans. This indubitable historical fact is, as Ramban correctly points out, &#x201C;a great proof&#x201D; that the Land belongs to Israel. Witness also the miraculous response of the Land since the recent return of the Jews to its borders.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2893">(161) Deuteronomy 26:1. &#x2014; The covenant referred to is <italic>ibid.</italic>, 28:1-68.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2894">(162) Haggai 1:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2895">(163) The word <italic>v&#x2019;ikavdah</italic> is in this instance actually written <italic>without</italic> the <italic>hei</italic> at the end. Ramban however is referring to the fact that according to the Masorah it is to be read as if it had the letter at the end. Hence his language: &#x201C;the &#x2018;additional&#x2019; <italic>hei</italic>&#x201D; &#x2026;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2896">(164) Abusaula. &#x2014; Thus the verse establishes that in the Second Temple there was the Glory of His Name. Haggai was one of the prophets who lived at the time of the building of the Second Temple.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2897">(165) &#x201C;They are: the ark with the cover and the cherubim, the Divine fire on the altar, the Divine Presence, the Holy Spirit, and the Urim and Thummim&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). For Urim and Thummim see Ramban on Exodus 28:30 (Vol. II, pp. 480-4).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2898">(166) Exodus 21:36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2899">(167) Verse 40.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2900">(168) Verse 42.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2901">(169) Nehemiah 4:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2902">(170) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2903">(171) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 9:36-37.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2904">(172) The reason for this explanation is that the word <italic>brithi</italic> (My covenant) is grammatically equivalent to saying <italic>habrith sheli</italic> (the covenant of Mine). Now since a noun that is preceded by the definite article cannot be in the construct state, it follows that there is a word implied here, which makes it: <italic>eth brithi &#x2018;brith&#x2019; Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> (My covenant, the covenant of Jacob). A similar explanation applies to the following two verses which Ramban mentions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2905">(173) II Chronicles 15:8. Here too the meaning is: <italic>v&#x2019;hanevuah &#x2018;nevuath&#x2019; Oded hanavi&#x2019;</italic> (and the prophecy &#x2014; a prophecy of Oded the prophet).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2906">(174) Deuteronomy 29:9. The meaning here too is: <italic>rasheichem &#x2018;rashei&#x2019; shivteichem</italic> (your heads &#x2014; heads of your tribes).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2907">(175) See Ramban above, 25:2 (towards the end) about the meaning of the word <italic>ha&#x2019;aretz</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2917">(185) Verse 44.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2918">(186) The Roman emperor in whose days the Second Temple was destroyed. The destruction of the Temple is thus in no sense a rejection of Israel. The survival of Israel long after the downfall of the Romans who destroyed the Temple, as well as the growth of Torah throughout the generations, and Israel&#x2019;s present return to the Land after an enforced absence of nearly 1900 years &#x2014; these are sufficient proofs that He did not reject us in the days of Vespasian.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2919">(187) A reference to the wars that took place during the Hellenistic period, when the Syrian Greeks who attempted to suppress the practice of Judaism were defeated by the Jews under the leadership of the Hasmoneans, and the Jews also regained their political independence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2920">(188) See Ezekiel Chapters 38-39. In the war of Gog and Magog G-d will finally overthrow the enemies of Israel who had assembled from all parts of the world against the Land of Israel. This victory will precede the reign of the Messiah.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2925">(193) See in Exodus. Vol. II, p. 350, Note 71.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2926">(194) Deuteronomy 15:19. This verse does not mean that the owner is to declare it &#x201C;holy,&#x201D; since it is automatically holy by virtue of being the firstborn, but, as Ramban continues, that we are to regard it as holy, etc.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2936">(204) I Samuel 14:44.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2937">(205) See Judges 11:30-34, where it is related that Jephthah vowed <italic>that whosoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be the Eternal&#x2019;s, and I will offer it up as a burnt-offering</italic>, and it was his daughter who came out to meet him first.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2938">(206) Bereshith Rabbah 60:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2939">(207) The source is unknown to me since we have no commentary of Ibn Ezra on the Book of Judges. This interpretation, however, is found in the commentary of Ralbag.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2940">(208) Judges 11:31.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2945">(213) See Ezekiel 16:31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2946">(214) Judges 11:39-40. Ramban&#x2019;s comment here is typical of Jewish teaching which abhors celibacy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2947">(215) Above, 19:26. See Ramban there.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2948">(216) Deuteronomy 24:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2949">(217) Sanhedrin 27 b. The meaning of the verse is thus: a parent cannot be condemned on the evidence of his children.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2950">(218) II Kings 14:6. Here it is obvious that the Rabbis also understood the verse in its literal sense &#x2014; that children are not to be put to death for the sins of their parents, and vice versa.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2951">(219) I Samuel 14:45.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2952">(220) In Verse 29 before us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2953">(221) The Sanctuary is &#x201C;the Palace&#x201D; and Jerusalem &#x201C;the garden of the Palace.&#x201D; The expression is taken from Esther 1:5. See, however, at end of his Sermon on the New Year (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, p. 289) where Ramban refers to the whole Land of Israel as &#x201C;the Palace of the King.&#x201D;</ftnote>
