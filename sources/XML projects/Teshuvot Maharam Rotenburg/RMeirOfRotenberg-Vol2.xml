<p><italic>Q</italic>. Two litigants agreed to abide by A&#x2019;s decision in their dispute. They asked him not to arbitrate but to render the decision according to strict law (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05D4;</span>). A listened to their arguments, returned to his home town, and sent his decision through a messenger who read it before the litigants. Is A&#x2019;s decision valid?</p>
<p><italic>A.</italic> If A&#x2019;s decision is a correct one, it is binding although A did not conform to the usual procedure of reading the decision personally, while seated, before the standing litigants. The procedure used in reading a court decision does not affect the legality of the decision. Moreover, since the litigants chose A as their judge and completely relied on his decision, such decision is binding regardless of the manner of its rendition.</p>

<h1><bold>390</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A and B placed their dispute in the hands of two mediators subject to a final decision between the two, of C, the third mediator. They agreed before an authoritative court, that should one party refuse to abide by the decision of the mediators, that party was to pay five <italic>marks</italic> to the cemetery fund or to the synagogue. They deposited valuable pledges with C to enforce their agreement. The mediators reached a decision on the second day. A, however, refused to abide thereby claiming that, at the time of the making of the agreement, it was understood by both parties that the decision of the mediators was not to be postponed till the second day. A brought two witnesses, one of whom testified that such was the understanding; the other witness was not sure whether the condition was made at the time of the agreement or subsequent thereto. C and the subscribing two witnesses denied A&#x2019;s allegation that such a condition was made at the time of the agreement. The Rabbis, therefore, decided that A must pay the five <italic>marks</italic> fine. A, then, changed his mind and expressed his desire to be bound by the decision of the mediators. Must he still pay the fine?</p>
<p><italic>A.</italic> As soon as A refused to accept the decision of the mediators, he became obliged to pay five <italic>marks</italic> to the sacred cause. Therefore, A must pay the five <italic>marks</italic> fine.</p>

<h1><bold>391</bold> (D)</h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. Two litigants appeared in court. They agreed to settle their dispute by arbitration, and bound themselves to that agreement by a <italic>kinyan</italic> in the presence of the worthies of the community. May one of the litigants still refuse to abide by the ruling of the court?</p>
<p><italic>A.</italic> An agreement accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic>, especially if made in the presence of the worthies of the community, is binding. Moreover, arbitration by three judges requires no <italic>kinyan</italic>.</p>
<p>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 215.</p>
<h1><bold>392</bold></h1>
<p>If litigants request that the judges adjudicate their case at night, and they solemnly agree to abide by such adjudication, the judges are permitted to hold court at night, and their decision, in such case, is binding. Therefore, a <italic>kinyan</italic> of an <italic>Asmakta</italic> transaction, made at night before an authoritative court, is binding since it is made with the consent of both parties.</p>
<p>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 29.</p>
<h1><bold>393</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. B, the defendant, in litigation with A, is willing to be bound by the decision of local judges. A, the claimant, insists upon having the local judges only hear the case, but demands that copies of the arguments be forwarded to a court of a different city for the decision. Must B comply with A&#x2019;s demands?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. No; only creditors can compel their debtors to appear before a higher court. In all other claims, claimants as well as defendants must rely on their local court, if either party insists upon it. The judges of the local court can either rely on their own judgment, or, in case of doubt, send an inquiry to any Rabbinical authority they (the judges) desire, disregarding the wishes of either party to the litigation.</p>
<p>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 960.</p>
<h1><bold>394</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. One of two opposing litigants wants his case to be tried by the local court of Rothenburg, while the other litigant insists on bringing it before the <italic>Beth Havaad</italic> (superior court) at Marienburg.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The Talmud differentiates between litigants, giving a creditor the right to choose the court for the trial of his case (Sanh. 31b). At present, however, an ordinance of the communities prevails to the effect that, in a place where an authoritative court exists, no litigant may insist on taking his case before the <italic>Beth Havaad</italic>. Therefore, the litigants (of Rothenburg) must choose a court that will hear their claims; and the court, in turn, will refer their claims to a superior court of its own choosing.</p>
<p>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 290. Cf. Weil, <italic>Responsa</italic> 155.</p>
<h1><bold>395</bold> (D)</h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. When a widow seeks to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> from the heirs, who has the right, she or the heirs, to compel the other to rely on a local court or to compel that other to appear before an authoritative court outside of the community?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If both parties agree to rely on the local court, the matter is left to the court either to rely on their own judgment, or to inquire of an authoritative court of their own choosing. But, if the parties to the suit come to no agreement, and one of the litigants demands that the case be brought before an authoritative court, the claimant has the right to determine before which court the case shall be tried. In this case the widow is the claimant.</p>
<p>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 98.</p>
<h1><bold>396</bold> (D)</h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A was involved in a litigation with B and C who were powerful leaders of the community. They summoned A to the local court. A, however, claimed that he could expect no justice in that court since B and C were in a position to overawe the judges, and A himself would be mentally intimidated and thus be unable to put forth his claims in the proper fashion.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A may force B and C to try the case in a court of a neighboring town.</p>
<p>The author adds: In a similar case my grandfather R. Isaac permitted R. Eliezer to refuse to appear before the court of Troyes in his litigation with R. Abraham because the latter was the leader of that town. For the same reason R. Samson b. Abraham permitted the bridegroom, R. Samson, a resident of Troyes, to refuse to appear before that court. R. Judah of Paris dealt similarly with R. Yom Tov b. Eliezer. I decided, therefore, to follow my elders.</p>

<h1><bold>397</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. An insane person fell heir to an estate. In his locality, however, no Jewish court exists to declare him insane and thus to permit the appointment of a trustee to manage the estate for his benefit. May a court declare him insane upon the testimony of two witnesses who have observed him in his locality?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the testimony of two witnesses is sufficient to deprive a person of his life, it should be sufficient to declare him insane and incapable of managing his affairs. The trustee thus appointed would have complete charge of his affairs, and, if need be, would be permitted even to provide him with a wife.</p>

<h1><bold>398</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. When we are confronted with a case regarding which authorities differ in their decisions, are we permitted to exercise our discretion in adjudicating such a case?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Only the outstanding scholar of the age and an authorized judge are permitted to exercise judicial discretion (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05C1;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05D0; &#x05D3;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D0;</span>) in a few cases prescribed by the Talmud. Otherwise the rule prevails that the burden of proof is upon the person seeking to collect money from his friend.</p>

<h1><bold>399</bold></h1>
<p>(1) <italic>Q</italic>. If A claims that the judges rendered an erroneous decision against him, can he summon the judges before a court?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Yes, for we have heard of no ban or ordinance passed by the communities against the summoning of judges before a court. Moreover, it is a daily occurrence that litigants complain against their judges and summon them to court. Therefore, if the court of appeal shall decide that the judges erred, the latter will have to reverse their decision; should they refuse to reverse their decision, they will have to compensate A out of their own pockets.</p>
<p>R. M. adds: In our days, since the judges do not exercise the power of summons, but are compelled by a ban of the communities to sit in court and render judgment to those who appear before them voluntarily, the talmudic law &#x2014; that the decision of the judges remains valid and the judges must compensate the injured party out of their own pockets &#x2014; cannot be applied.</p>
<p>(2) <italic>Q</italic>. The judges allowed A a definite period of time within which to appeal his case before another court and A agreed to it. Now the specified term has expired; can A still appeal his case?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since A&#x2019;s agreement to the term for appeal set by the judges was not accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic>, it is not binding and A can still appeal his case.</p>
<p>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 715; Mord. Sanh. 676&#x2013;7.</p>
<h1><bold>400</bold></h1>
<p>You asked me regarding the judges. I usually refrain from expressing my opinion before a litigant, lest I suggest advice to him as against his opponent.</p>
<p>S<small>OURCES</small>: <italic>Tashbetz</italic>, 518.</p>
<h1><bold>401</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A and C were negotiating a marriage. They deposited pledges with B. When a dispute arose between them, they brought their case before the worthies of the community who ordered B to deliver the pledges to C. This decision was later proven to be erroneous. Now A demands that B compensate him for the loss of his pledges.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since B claims that A and C had undertaken to abide by the decision of the community leaders, and that he merely obeyed such decision, he is free from obligation. Although these leaders were ignorant in the law, their decision was nevertheless binding since A and C had accepted them as judges. The leaders and worthies of a community, because they are generally accepted by the members of their community and are in the same category as the Syrian courts (Git. 23a), form an authoritative court. Should A deny B&#x2019;s claim (that he obeyed the order of the community leaders), B would be free from obligation since a witness supports his claim. Moreover, no oath is exacted from a trustee who claims to have carried out his commission. Even if the mistake of the court became known before B delivered the pledges to C, and B nevertheless obeyed the order of the court, he is free from obligation, for A and C originally agreed to abide by the decision of the community leaders; and the custom is widely accepted throughout our kingdom that whatever obligations a person assumes in the presence of the community leaders become binding and unretractable. The leaders of a community wield the same authority over the members of their community regarding matters for which they were elected, as the great scholars of each generation wield over all of Israel.</p>

<h1><bold>402</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A, wishing to appeal to a higher court, demands that the local court give him a written statement as to the reasons underlying the court&#x2019;s decision in his case versus B. Can B be enjoined from issuing execution on the rendered judgment until such time as the appeal has been disposed of?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. No, B may collect his money immediately.</p>

<h1><bold>403</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. How long after a decision of a court has been rendered, is a party to the suit entitled to a statement as to the reasons underlying such decision? Within what period, after a decision has been rendered, can a person appeal to a higher court? Must one declare before the local court that he will seek an appeal?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If a party to a suit originally wanted to bring his case to a higher court but was forced to try it at the local court, he is entitled to a written statement of the reasons for the decision, and he may appeal his case at any time. But if both parties agreed to have their case tried by the local court, the court is under no obligation to give any written opinion.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. How much time is a defendant allowed to comply with the court&#x2019;s decision and pay the claimant, before further action is taken against him?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A defendant is allowed thirty days to comply with the decision of the court, if he is ordered to pay money to the claimant. If, however, the court&#x2019;s order is that he take an oath, he must do so at the next court session. Moreover, action is immediately taken against a defendant who admits that he has money, but refuses to comply with the court&#x2019;s decision.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Does the plaintiff or the defendant pay the expenses of the messenger [hired to procure the Responsum from a talmudic authority]?</p>

<h1><bold>406</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. Several partners sue A for money. A demands that the partners choose a representative to present their arguments, for he may be at a disadvantage in having to answer the arguments of several people. May each partner claim that he wants to present his arguments personally for his own interests?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Each partner has a right to present his claims personally. Furthermore, any testimony of one partner disadvantageous to the other partners is treated as the testimony of a single witness; and the testimony of two partners disadvantageous to the other partners is treated as the testimony of two witnesses.</p>
<p>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 332; Mord. Ket. 299; Rashba I, 1107.</p>
<h1><bold>407</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A claims that he will not be able to argue his case properly because the partners, his opponents, being many, will confuse him. He demands that his friends be near him while he presents his arguments. May the partners object on the grounds that they do not want A&#x2019;s friends to listen to their private affairs, and that A&#x2019;s friends may direct A&#x2019;s presentation of his arguments by sly hints and facial expressions?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A cannot have his friends present at the trial, neither can the partners be present while one of them presents his claims, so that A may not be confronted with all the partners at the same time. Each partner shall present his claims separately and the verdict shall be passed on the accumulated evidence. If the court finds difficulty in remembering all the facts and claims, let the partners present their claims before two or three courts, or in two or three days to the same court, or let the court keep a written record of all claims.</p>
<p>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 333; Mord. Shebu. 761; Rashba I. 1107.</p>
<h1><bold>408</bold></h1>
<p>When a person sues, or is being sued by, a partnership, he may not demand, on the ground that the multiple claims of the various partners will overburden and confuse him, that one partner represent the partnership. Each partner may insist on personally presenting his claims for his share. On the other hand, at the trial a statement made by a partner, supporting one of the claims or counterclaims of the opponent, has the force of testimony by a single witness, either to obligate the partners to take a Biblical oath, or to free the opponent from the obligation of taking such an oath.</p>
<p>S<small>OURCES</small>: Hag. Mord. Ket. 299.</p>
<h1><bold>409</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. In the dispute between A and B the court found that B owed A money. A demanded either immediate payment, or that B put up a bond to insure such payment. B, however, asked for the usual thirty days&#x2019; interval in which to carry out the decision of the court. Are A&#x2019;s demands justified?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B is entitled to the thirty days&#x2019; interval. The system of justice current in Israel is guaranty enough for A that after the thirty days will have passed the court will enforce its ruling. The reason for allowing a person only thirty days within which to comply with a court&#x2019;s decision, while, according to the Talmud, an <italic>adrakta</italic> is written after a ninety day interval, is this: An <italic>adrakta</italic> is written when the court finds no property from which to collect; but, if the property of the debtor is within reach, a judgment is enforced after the thirty days&#x2019; interval has passed.</p>

<h1><bold>410</bold></h1>
<p>a) <italic>Q</italic>. Is a person who reached his majority, permitted to appoint a legal representative to argue his case in court? The Palestinian Talmud (Sanh. 2, 1) definitely implies that a high priest is permitted to appoint such a representative.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The statement in the Palestinian Talmud does not necessarily imply that an ordinary person is permitted to appoint a legal representative. It is possible that only a high priest is permitted to appoint such a representative, in order to save him the humiliation of appearing before a court having less authority than himself; but an ordinary person may not be permitted to make the appointment. In any case, all are agreed that a levir is not permitted to appoint a legal representative when his brother&#x2019;s widow demands that he fulfill the positive command (of God) to perform the ceremony of <italic>halitzah</italic> or to marry her. Moreover, a person commits a wrong when he consents to become a legal representative to a levir, thus helping to postpone the fulfillment of this positive command, and injuring the interests of the widow.</p>
<p>b) <italic>Q</italic>. Is a legal representative permitted to present before the court claims and arguments that will improve his client&#x2019;s case but which he knows to be false?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The plaintiff, or defendant, himself is not permitted to lie in order to improve his case in court; a legal representative, therefore, is surely not permitted to lie.</p>
<p>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 246; L. 126, 127; Mord. B. M. 276; cf. P. 519; <italic>Mordecai Hagadol</italic>, p. 270a.</p>
<h1><bold>411</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A claims that his representative caused him to lose his case against B by willful neglect, for the representative pleaded in court those arguments which A asked him not to plead, and neglected to plead those arguments which he specifically asked him to. A, therefore, demands that his representative compensate him for the loss caused him.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A lost money through his representative&#x2019;s willful neglect, the latter must make good A&#x2019;s loss. But, if the case is such that had the representative pleaded A&#x2019;s arguments, A would have had to swear and be able to recover, or swear and be free from obligation, and now the case is that the oath has either been transferred to B, or that now B may collect without taking an oath, the representative is free from obligation, since the damage to A&#x2019;s interests is not clear and remains problematical, as no one can be sure that A would have taken the required oath. However, if the case is such that had the representative pleaded A&#x2019;s arguments, A would be free from obligation and would not be required to take an oath, and now B collects from A without being required to take an oath, the representative is guilty of willful neglect.</p>

<p>A owed money to B and refused to pay his debt. The Rabbis of Spiers, basing their decision on the statement of R. Nahman (B. K. 27b) that a man is permitted to take the law into his own hands, gave B permission to break into A&#x2019;s house and forcefully take possession of A&#x2019;s valuables in payment of the debt.</p>
<p>R. Meir wrote to the Rabbis of Spiers not to ascribe legal absurdities to R. Nahman; for such interpretation of the words of R. Nahman was not only in opposition to an explicit statement of the <italic>Mishna</italic> (B. M. 9, 13) but was even against the very words of the Pentateuch (Deut. 24,10). A person is permitted according to R. Nahman, to enter into another person&#x2019;s house and take away an object definitely known to be his own, but he is not permitted to touch an object belonging to the other person, unless accompanied by a law-court official.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Must a court decree be dated, since, otherwise, a creditor who obtains a later decree would be able to enforce his rights thereunder, prior to the creditor who received the former decree.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. It is advisable to include the date in a court decree, but not for the reason cited. A creditor, whose bond is dated before the bond of his fellow creditor, should receive a prior lien if execution is to be issued upon real property; but if execution is to be issued upon personal property, the creditor who seizes the property first has a prior lien without regard to the date of his bond. In any case, the date of the court decree is immaterial. Moreover, no undated document is invalid except a divorce.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. In a litigation in which he was a defendant, A agreed to admit in evidence the testimony of two interested witnesses. After the witnesses testified before the court, A asked the court to reject their testimony on the ground that they were interested witnesses.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A&#x2019;s request should not be granted in view of the fact that he did not object before the testimony of the interested witnesses was presented. After witnesses present their testimony the case is closed and neither the defendant nor even the witnesses themselves can reopen it.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. Since B had accepted the Gentile as a trustworthy witness and had accompanied the acceptance by a <italic>kinyan</italic>, the testimony of the Gentile was equivalent to that of Jewish witnesses. Therefore B&#x2019;s protest was of no avail.</p>

M. 28a, states: Where two persons lay claim to an object found by a third, each of the two giving the proper identifying marks and one of them supporting his claim by the testimony of a single witness, the testimony of that witness is of no avail. Does not this talmudic law contradict the statement of R. Tam?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. There is no contradiction. R. Tam means to say that whenever a person would be entitled to collect his claim were he to take an oath to support it, such an oath would not be required if he obtain the testimony of a single witness supporting the claim. Thus, the testimony of a single witness directed against a litigant has the effect of requiring an oath (denying the truth of such testimony) when otherwise no oath would have been required; and such testimony in favor of a litigant has the effect of rendering unnecessary an oath that otherwise would have been required. However, when two persons lay claim to an object found by a third and both give the proper identifying marks, no oath is accepted from either of the claimants and the object is not delivered to either of them. Therefore, the additional testimony of a single witness does not change the situation.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. B lent money to A. The latter promised to give to the former half of the profits he would derive from all his business transactions, including those transactions in which money borrowed from a third party would be employed. Is this promise binding on A?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the promise was accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic> in the presence of witnesses, it is binding; otherwise it is a mere <italic>asmakhta</italic> (exaggerated promise) and is not binding.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A advanced forty ounces (of silver) to B for purposes of investment to share equally in the profits. After the lapse of some time, B gave A ten ounces, telling him that it was his share of the profits. Subsequently, B gave A a pound and told him that the first ten ounces he gave him were part of the principal; that his transactions brought in no profits, and that, for fear lest A would immediately demand his money, he had originally lied to him by telling him that the ten ounces were profit.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since B still owes money to A, and since B could have denied owing anything to him, B is to be believed upon the taking of an oath that his transactions with A&#x2019;s money brought no profit. Therefore, if B takes such an oath, the ten ounces B has given A as profit, are to be considered as part of the principal.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A and B appeared in court. A claimed that two years previously he had lent money belonging to orphans to B for investment purposes on condition that the orphans share equally in the profits as well as in the losses. He demanded that B return this money since B was not financially as well off as he had been two years previously and might lose the orphans&#x2019; money. B, on the other hand, claimed that the money was given to him by the grandfather and mother of the orphans with the condition that he do not return it under any circumstances, not even to themselves, until the orphans grow up and get married; that he now intended to abide by this agreement even though the grandfather died meanwhile and his heirs have demanded the return of this money; and that he was richer at this time than two years previously, since at that time he owned no real estate while now he did, and also had property of his own.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the grandfather and the mother of the orphans were not trustees &#x2014; never having been duly appointed by the court, the father of the orphans, or the orphans themselves &#x2014; they had no right to administer the latter&#x2019;s money. Therefore, the agreements they had entered into regarding this money, were void. If they were duly appointed as trustees for the orphans, they ought to be discharged for lending money belonging to orphans without adequate security, and without receiving notes of indebtedness, and on terms injurious to the orphans&#x2019; interests; since according to the agreement the orphans were to share in the losses, as well as in the profits, resulting from B&#x2019;s transactions. Such money must be lent to a rich and trustworthy man, on adequate security, and on condition that the orphans share only in the profits but not in the losses. Any trustee not heeding this rule could be discharged without notice for damaging the orphans&#x2019; interests, and the agreements he had entered into would become void at the time he was discharged. Since B admitted that the money lent to him belonged to orphans, and that it was lent to him on conditions injurious to the latter, the agreement he entered into with the trustees of said orphans, was void, and he had to return the money.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A claims that: a) B personally lent him money for investment purposes to share equally in the profits, b) he secured this loan by delivering his pledges to B, c) subsequently he gave ten <italic>marks</italic> to B, which amount constituted B&#x2019;s part of the profits, d) he then repaid the principal to B but the latter failed to return the pledges, e) meanwhile B&#x2019;s house burned down, the pledges were damaged by the fire, and the magistrate took them together with other valuables that belonged to B. Now, A demands that B pay him back the ten <italic>marks</italic>, since his investments earned no profits. He further demands that B pay him for the pledges since they were lost through B&#x2019;s failure to return them (after having received his money), which failure constituted a wilful neglect on B&#x2019;s part. B, on the other hand, claims that: a) the money he lent to A belonged to orphans, b) the money was lent to A by a third party, c) he took the pledges because he was the trustee of the orphans, d) he is not responsible for the loss of the pledges since he did not hinder A from taking them away after the debt was paid.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B is free from obligation, and is not required to take an oath to support his claims, for the following reasons: a) The money-lending transaction was legitimate even if it was carried out in accordance with A&#x2019;s version thereof; b) a creditor is not responsible for a loss of pledges through unavoidable accident, if he received such pledges at the time the loan was contracted; c) after A gave ten <italic>marks</italic> to B as B&#x2019;s share of the profits, A may no longer claim that he had made a mistake, and that ultimately his investments earned no profits.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. No, he may not.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A claims that L(eah) delivered him into the hands of Gentiles and caused him a loss of one hundred and five pounds. L denies A&#x2019;s charge. A further claims that he lent L twelve pounds for investment purposes to share equally in the profits. L avers that A lent her ten pounds upon interest [the interest was to be two pounds], that she has repaid five pounds and still owes him five pounds of old coins.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Regarding the first charge, if L will take an oath in support of her claim, she will be free from obligation. Regarding the latter claim, although I have heard in the name of R. Tam that the principle &#x201C;a person will not let stand what is permitted and eat what is forbidden&#x201D;, as applied to the case where the creditor claims to have lost his <italic>prosbol</italic> (Git. 37b), is also applicable to a case such as the one mentioned above, some great scholars draw a clear distinction between the case of <italic>prosbol</italic>, where the debtor does not know whether or not the creditor has had a <italic>prosbol</italic>, and a claim such as the one mentioned above where the debtor knows the terms of the agreement, and his denial, therefore, of the creditor&#x2019;s claim, ought to carry weight. Moreover, R. Tam&#x2019;s decision probably applies only when the creditor had received a pledge and, thus, was in possession of his money. But, in our case, A seeks to collect. Therefore, L may take an oath to the effect that she owes A only five pounds of old coins, and, after repaying that sum, be free from further obligation.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Leah lent A one pound for investment, and was to receive half of the profits. She claims: a) that she gave the money to A partly on trust, and partly because she received clothes as security from him; b) that she made a condition with A that he lend the money only if adequately secured; c) that later A asked her to return to him his wife&#x2019;s coat (which was part of the security), and promised to give it back to her after the holiday; d) that he never returned the coat, and e) that he paid her only 60 pennies of the principal. A claims: a) that Leah lent him the money without any security; b) that he was supposed to lend it as he saw fit; c) that the clothes he deposited with Leah were deposited for safe-keeping only, because he was angry with his mother-in-law, and not as security for the loan; d) that he lent the money to others without security, and e) that his debtors failed to repay the loans.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Leah shoud swear that she made a condition with A to lend the money only if adequately secured.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. R(achel) lent L(eah) twenty <italic>marks</italic>, secured by pledges, for the purpose of investment and was to share equally in the profits. Part of the money, according to R, belonged to orphans and the other part was deposited with her for the purpose of educating the orphans and contributing to other religious causes with the profit derived therefrom. Subsequently, L paid back to R sixteen <italic>marks</italic>, gave her a pledge worth ten <italic>solidi</italic> which a Gentile had deposited with L as security for a loan of one <italic>mark</italic>, told R that the investments had brought in a profit of fourteen <italic>marks</italic>, and said that she took for herself seven <italic>marks</italic> which constituted her part of the profits. Two days later, however, L claimed she had searched her assets and investments carefully and could find no trace of the seven <italic>marks</italic> profit coming to R, and that she did not know what had become of that money. She demanded that R return her pledges in exchange for the three <italic>marks</italic> she still owed R on the principal. R said that when L paid her the sixteen <italic>marks</italic>, the pledges were left in her (R&#x2019;s) possession as security for the four <italic>marks</italic> of the principal and the seven <italic>marks</italic> of profit coming to her; that she would not return the pledges until the eleven <italic>marks</italic> were paid to her; that L had probably spent the seven <italic>marks</italic> on her sustenance, since she had no money and no source of income; and that she (R) ought not to suffer any loss on the one <italic>mark</italic> loan made to the Gentile against a pledge worth ten <italic>solidi</italic>, since she had expressly instructed L to lend the money against adequate security only. L rejoined that R had given her no such instructions; that she knew the Gentile very well, had always trusted him and at one time had lent him ten pounds without security which he had repaid in full; and that when she extended the loan to the Gentile she acted in good faith and was, therefore, not responsible for the loss resulting therefrom. L denied having spent the seven <italic>marks</italic> on her sustenance, and further denied that her pledges were left in R&#x2019;s possession as security for the seven <italic>marks</italic> profit, claiming that these pledges were deposited as security for the principal only. The court set up to register the claims [for the purpose of sending it to an authoritative court for decision] thoroughly questioned L regarding the disappearance of half of the fourteen <italic>marks</italic> she had originally admitted she had earned, but could receive no clear explanation from her. She claimed that whenever she earned a profit of ten or twenty <italic>solidi</italic> she spent half of it for her daily needs and added the other half to the principal, since such was her understanding with R; that she had thus spent seven <italic>marks</italic> out of the profit, and that when she finally counted up her assets she could find no trace of the seven <italic>marks</italic> profit coming to R. She believes that the money was either lost or stolen, or disappeared in some other manner unknown to her.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A person with whom money is deposited for investment purposes and who is to share equally in the profits, assumes the responsibility of a debtor for one half of the money [the profit of which half belongs to him], and the responsibility of a bailee for the other half [the profit of which belongs to the depositor]. If, in addition to the money, the depositor pays a small token fee to the bailee as compensation for his trouble in managing the investments, the latter has the responsibility of a paid bailee for the second half of the deposit; but when no such fee is paid, the responsibility of the bailee thereto is that of a gratuitous bailee. Since L claims to have added the seven <italic>marks</italic> profit to the principal, her responsibility to this profit became the same as to the principal. Therefore, if R paid L a token fee for her trouble in managing the investments, L was responsible for the loss or theft of the seven <italic>marks</italic>. Although some authorities would disagree with this decision, we follow the authorities favoring R&#x2019;s interests, since she is in possession of the pledges. But, if R paid L no such fee, the latter will be responsible for only half that amount, upon the taking of an oath to the effect that the seven <italic>marks</italic> were lost through no negligence on her part, and that she did not misappropriate them. However, should R claim that according to her agreement with L the profit was not to be joined to the principal and that it was to be given to her immediately, or that it was left with L as a loan and not for reinvestment, R will be entitled to collect the entire seven <italic>marks</italic> upon the taking of an oath to the truth of such claim. We must be satisfied with such oath, since she is in possession of the pledges. Regarding the loan to the Gentile against inadequate security, R may take an oath to the effect that she had specifically instructed L not to lend the money unless adequately secured, and be entitled to collect the one <italic>mark</italic>; or she may demand that L take an oath as to the truth of her (L&#x2019;s) claim.</p>

<h1><bold>433</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A summoned B, the brother of his wife L, to court. A claimed that his wife, L, who took part in managing his business, had transferred to her brother, B, a debt of four pounds of coins due her from C; that in B&#x2019;s presence L told C to pay his debt to B, and that the latter would be under obligation to repay to her that money as well as half of the profit he (B) would earn therewith; that L released C from obligation to her because B had undertaken to be responsible for the money; that C promised by solemn hand-clasp to repay his debt to B, and that the latter consequently promised L by solemn hand-clasp to repay her the money and half of his profit therefrom; and that L permitted B to retain for himself the chickens he might receive from his Gentile debtors as presents.<xref rid="fn1">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>B averred that L had stealthily taken the four pounds from A and had lent them to C; that she acted stealthily because she was afraid of her husband; that subsequently she encountered difficulty in collecting the money from C who had no money with which to repay her; that consequently she asked B to collect the money for her; that he, B, obligated himself to pay L the principal plus half the profit he might earn therewith, should he succeed in collecting the money from C; that his obligation to L was not to begin till C repaid his debt; and that C never paid him the money. B further claimed that he had not in C&#x2019;s presence provided L with sureties for the debt nor came to an agreement with her regarding the conditions of the transaction; but that L merely told C to repay his debt to B, without any further qualification; that when he subsequently came to demand the money from C, the latter asked him for an extension of the loan for four weeks; that L advised him to grant C that extension; that in all his dealings with C he consulted L and followed her instructions; that he reminded L repeatedly that his obligation toward her would not begin till C repay his debt, and that she invariably agreed with him.</p>
<p>The trustee appointed by L confirmed (in her name) A&#x2019;s claims and denied those of B. The trustee further claimed that L had stipulated in her agreement with B that he invest her money only against pledges, and that B violated this agreement by granting C an extension. Does the granting of permission to the active partner to receive gifts from the prospective Gentile debtors legitimize the aforesaid seemingly usurious transaction (for the plaintiff thinks that such stipulation does legitimatize the transaction) according to which B was to be responsible for the entire principal and was also expected to share the profits with L?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If L released C because B took over C&#x2019;s obligation and told L to release C, B&#x2019;s responsibility was that of a surety who guaranteed a loan at the time it was consumated, and was, therefore, responsible even if his act was not accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic>. But, if L merely told C to pay his debt to B, the latter is not responsible for the debt, even if he did not expressly stipulate the condition that his responsibility begin only after C had repaid his debt. Although L claims that B promised by solemn hand-clasp to go surety for C, since B denies this claim he is free from obligation and is not required to take an oath. Had B made such promise by solemn hand-clasp, we would compel him to carry out his promise. However, we impose no oath on a person who denies having promised by solemn hand-clasp, when such a person would be under no obligation to the alleged promisee if he truly made no promise by solemn hand-clasp. Therefore, if B take an oath to the effect that L did not release C because of B&#x2019;s promise, or that he, B, had expressly stipulated the condition that he was not to become obligated till C has repaid his debt, he would be free from obligation. B&#x2019;s alleged solemn hand-clasp, however, does not take the place of such oath. Since aside from that hand-clasp, B would have been under obligation to L if her other claims were true, such a hand-clasp does not take the place of a judicial oath administered while holding the Scroll of the Law.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. We are in doubt concerning the implications of the following ruling of the scholars of Nehardea: When one person gives goods to another in order that the latter trade therewith and the former share in the profits, half of the value of such goods is considered a loan (at the risk of the active partner) and the other half, a trust (at the risk of the investor). Does this statement imply that the part which is considered a loan is subject to all the laws governing loans, even to the extent of being cancelled by a Sabbatical year? Would it not work to the disadvantage of the investor?</p>

At first A admitted to the court the truth of D&#x2019;s claims, but a considerable time later he retracted his admission.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A can not retract his admission. Therefore, if the duke repaid new coins to A, B, and C, they in turn must pay D new coins; but if the duke repaid them with old coins they must pay D the value of the coins he paid to the Gentile at the time he made the payment.</p>

<p>1) <italic>Q</italic>. R(achel), a widow, entered into the following agreement with B and his wife L(eah): 1) B and his wife undertook to provide food for R and her servant-girl until her death; 2) R, on the other hand, was to give to B and L her late husband&#x2019;s chain valued at fifteen <italic>marks</italic>; 3) B and his wife were to come to live in R&#x2019;s house (R owned a half interest in a house) and were to pay the interest to the mortgagee of R&#x2019;s house who was a Gentile; 4) in case B or his wife survived R the fifteen <italic>marks</italic> would be forfeited; and 5) in case both, B and his wife, died before R, she was to receive from their estate fifteen <italic>marks</italic> minus one-quarter <italic>mark</italic> for every year from the time of signing the contract. R delivered the chain to B and L. Subsequently B died and L moved to a place where there was no <italic>minyan</italic>. R demands from L her board and the interest due on the mortgaged house. L claims that she cannot afford to live in one place and provide food for R and her servant in another place. R refuses to leave her city, her daughter, her relatives, and the place where she can pray with a <italic>minyan</italic>. Can R compel L to provide food for her in R&#x2019;s city; and is not the contract void since in case L died before R and the latter reclaimed her money, the food L provided her with would constitute illegal interest?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. L cannot force R to come to live with her, and R can not force L to support her while L is away, for neither of them would have entered into the original agreement had they forseen such eventualities. Moreover, the contract is void since there is a possibility that the food R receives from L would constitute illegal interest on R&#x2019;s money. L, therefore, should deduct from the fifteen <italic>marks</italic>, the amount she expended on R&#x2019;s food, and return the rest to R.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. R drew an instrument in which she stated that from then on and after her death, her (real) estate should belong to her brother, to certain people and to charity, on condition that she retain the right to sell any part of it if hard pressed for funds with which to feed and clothe herself. R, now, desires to sell part of her property claiming that she needs the money for her sustenance. The charity-trustee refuses to grant her permission to do so, claiming that R is not hard pressed for funds since she receives her food from L and since she has sufficient clothes.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If it is known that R is not in dire need of money for her sustenance, she may not sell any part of her property. But if this is not a known fact, R may promise under oath that she will not sell any part of her property unless she will need the money for her sustenance. She will be permitted, then, to sell such part of her property the proceeds of which will suffice for her sustenace for a period of six months. That money should be deposited with a trustee who would pay her a monthly allowance.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. Authorities differ regarding the rights of a husband over his wife&#x2019;s dowry. Some authorities decide that a husband has the rights of a buyer [who is not responsible for the seller&#x2019;s debts] while others hold that his rights are those of an heir [who is liable for the debts of his benefactor]. Since we can not choose between these conflicting opinions, we allow the money to remain in the hands of the present possessor. And since L has no money and will have no money till she be widowed or divorced, there is no sense in exacting an oath from her. We give B a written verdict, however, to the effect that in case L be widowed or divorced she then must take an oath denying B&#x2019;s claim or pay that debt.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. The testimony of the witnesses to the effect that B provided A with a surety, is convincing proof that A had given the money to B as a loan. Although a person will sometimes buy what by law belongs to him in order to avoid litigation, this principle applies only when the rightful owner is not in possession of the disputed property, while in our case B was in possession of the money. Moreover, even if there were no such witnesses, we would have put no credence in B&#x2019;s assertion that he provided A with a surety only because he acted &#x201C;inside the line of justice.&#x201D; For the principle of <italic>Miggo</italic> &#x2014; that we ought to believe B&#x2019;s present statement since, were he inclined to lie, he could have denied altogether having provided A with a surety &#x2014; does not apply to this case, since we are thoroughly convinced that had B not owed the money to A, he would not have repaid part of it.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A lent money, on trust, to B who subsequently left for a distant country where he was robbed of all his possessions. Upon his return he settled with A for three halves (half-pounds, <italic>marks</italic>), and gave A a note of indebtedness in which no specific date of month or day, but the calendar year since the creation of the world appeared, and which contained a clause to the effect that A is to be believed without an oath should any litigation arise concerning this debt. After B&#x2019;s death his widow seized his property in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>, which property barely covered ten percent of her claim, without taking the usual oath required of a widow upon the collection of her <italic>ketubah</italic>. Ten years after the death of B&#x2019;s widow, A presented his note for collection and demanded the full amount from B&#x2019;s sons. The latter claimed that their father left them nothing, that they inherited valuables from their mother only, and that B had paid A part of the debt contained in the note. A single witness testified, and A himself finally admitted, that B had repaid one-sixth of the debt.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A controversy exists regarding the status of the property seized by a widow in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>, if the widow died before taking the required oath. Some are of the opinion that the entire property reverts to the husband&#x2019;s estate; while others hold that the part of such property which is valued at no more than half of the amount of the widow&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic> remains part of the widow&#x2019;s estate, while anything above that amount reverts to the husband&#x2019;s estate. The latter opinion is accepted. Therefore, if B&#x2019;s sons take an oath that they inherited nothing from their father, they are free from any obligation to A. If, however, they are willing to repay their father&#x2019;s debt, they may demand that A take an oath as to the amount actually due him, since he has been proven to be untrustworthy.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A sent his messenger to take wine from his Gentile debtor in payment of his debt. The messenger carried out his order and pulled the wagon of wine for the purpose of taking possession thereof by this act. However when the Gentile brought the wine to town he gave it to his other creditor, B. Now A sues B for that wine.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The law of agency does not apply to a Gentile, nor can he confer a benefit, for the law of conferring a benefit is deduced from the law of agency. Therefore when the Gentile gave the wine to the messenger for A&#x2019;s benefit, his act was not valid. Furthermore, since the messenger strove to take possession of the goods of a debtor for the benefit of one creditor though the debtor owed money to other creditors, his act was invalid (Ket. 84b). Moreover, perhaps Rashi&#x2019;s opinion is accepted that one cannot acquire ownership of a Gentile&#x2019;s property by a <italic>kinyan</italic> of pulling. Finally, B may not be called &#x201C;wicked&#x201D;, for interfering with another man&#x2019;s business, since the Gentile owed him money.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Ten Jews individually loaned various sums of money to a feudal lord, each one receiving pledges as security, independently of the others. One day, the feudal lord called them together and told them that he preferred to deal with them collectively instead of individually. He also wanted an extension of the loans. Furthermore, he stipulated that whenever he would pay them a sum of money as interest they should divide it among themselves in proportion to their oans, and whatever he would repay on the principal should also be so divided. The creditors agreed to this arrangement. Subsequently, however, one creditor succeeded in collecting his debt independently of the others. Must he share with the others the amount he has collected?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since the creditors did not actually pool their money, their efforts, or their pledges, and did not form a partnership by any binding act, no partnership existed. Each creditor had a right to act in pursuance of his own interests. However, if the loan of the creditor who collected his debt independently was well secured by pledges or sureties, or if the security was sufficient to warrant a new loan by him, he may be called &#x201C;wicked&#x201D; for having damaged the interests of the other creditors. This is in accordance with the talmudic law (Kidd. 59a): If a poor man &#x201C;turneth a cake&#x201D; and another takes it away from him, the latter is called &#x201C;wicked&#x201D;.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>.

He, therefore, demands these three pounds. L denies any knowledge of A&#x2019;s expenses, but is ready to pay the amount that, A will state under oath, is due him.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. L&#x2019;s promise to A was a mere <italic>Asmakhta</italic>. Since this promise was not made before an authoritative court, even if it was accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic>, it was not binding.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. If A specified at the time the loan was made that he was to be repaid a certain number of coins, B must repay him the same number of new coins, though he will thus repay more precious metal than what he borrowed, since an increase in the metal of less than twenty-five percent does not affect prices. But, if A did not specify the manner of repayment, he is to receive the same amount of precious metal as he lent to B, in new coins.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. The fact that there is no actual loss of money to B does not, of itself, absolve A from taking an oath. A is not required to take the oath for another reason.

<p>Q. A owed money to several persons. When B demanded his money from A, the latter admitted the debt but claimed that since he did not possess enough money or valuables to cover all his obligations, he preferred to divide his possessions equitably among his creditors. Since A admits, in court, his debt to B, may the latter force A to repay that debt in full, before he divides his property?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since A owes money to several persons, and since he owes more than the total value of his possessions, each creditor is entitled to receive an equal share of such possessions irrespective of the amount due him. The debtor, however, may distribute his assets among his creditors in proportion to the amount due to each, before they come to court; such distribution would be irrevocable, and would even constitute a praiseworthy act. Since A is willing so to divide his possessions, no judge can force him to favor one creditor at the expense of the other creditors. However, before receiving his share of A&#x2019;s possessions, movables or immovables, each creditor will have to take a creditor&#x2019;s oath &#x2014; the same oath that a creditor takes upon collecting his debt from encumbered property.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. If B was present when C told A to give the money to B, the latter became legal owner of the money. Should C&#x2019;s Gentile creditors now institute garnishee proceedings against B, B may take an oath, to the effect that he has none of C&#x2019;s money, with a clear conscience. However, if B was not present when C told A to give the money to B, the mere statement of C, unaccompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic>, did not transfer the money to B.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A owes money to B and B owes the same amount to a Gentile. B told A, in the presence of the Gentile, to pay his debt directly to the Gentile. The Gentile released B and depended upon A for payment. A successfully avoids payment to the Gentile because of an old debt due him from the latter. Since, according to Jewish law, the transaction was not valid and A&#x2019;s indebtedness to B was not legally transferred to the Gentile, A must pay his debt to B. But why should B be permitted to rob the Gentile? Is not robbing a Gentile prohibited? Moreover, the Gentile presses A for payment and eventually may force A to pay him his money; must A pay his debt to B?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Robbing a Gentile is prohibited, but one is permitted to annul a Gentile&#x2019;s debt (if he can do so by using plausible excuses and without causing the name of the Lord to be profaned). But, if A will be forced to pay the debt to the Gentile, he will not have to pay anything to B.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A claimed that he gave B a coat of mail and thigh plates as security for a loan. He repaid that loan, and therefore demands back his security. B answered that he received from A only a coat of mail which he was ready to return upon the latter&#x2019;s payment of money still due B. Upon hearing B&#x2019;s reply, A said to the judges that he knew that the law required them to charge B with an oath, but that B was not qualified to take an oath since he was a notorious thief and was suspected of swearing falsely. A made a public announcement that whoever knew anything that might disqualify B from taking an oath, should appear and testify before the court and the community leaders, in accordance with the Biblical injunction (Leviticus, 5, 1). Many witnesses appeared, but the testimony of only three persons was valid. One of these testified that B had stolen one pound from him; the second said that B had testified against him in a Gentile court and thus had caused him to suffer damages; and the third testified that B had bound himself by a <italic>herem</italic> to redeem his pledged horse, and had failed to do so. Since these misdemeanors had happened long ago and B might have repented since then, was the testimony of these witnesses sufficient to disqualify B from taking an oath?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B should be disqualified from taking an oath because of the testimony of the first and third witnesses. The Talmud (B. K. 62a) came to no conclusion regarding the trustworthiness of an informer; therefore, the testimony of the second witness is of no consequence.</p>

A made no payment on the date due after the extension; B, therefore, claims that the pledge became forfeited. A denies having said, &#x201C;Take formal possession.&#x2026;&#x2026;henceforth&#x201D;.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Usually a statement, such as A is alleged to have made, is classified as <italic>Asmakhta</italic> and is not binding. But since B is in possession of the pledged articles, and since B has done a favor to A in lending him money, this satement is no longer classified as <italic>Asmakhta</italic> and is binding. Therefore, if B takes an oath that A made the statement: &#x201C;Take formal possession..&#x2026;henceforth&#x201D;, the pledge belongs to B.</p>

To A&#x2019;s charge that the objects are still in B&#x2019;s possession, B retorts that he subsequently bought them from the <italic>Cahorsin</italic>.

A further claims that he has provided B&#x2019;s Pentateuch with punctuation marks, that he was not paid for his labor, and that he can prove through witnesses that B owes him three pounds. B, however, claims to have already paid his obligations to A.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Regarding B&#x2019;s claim that he had paid his obligations to A, if he will take an oath to this effect, he will be free from obligation to A. Regarding A&#x2019;s first claim, however, the following distinction must be made: If B admits that A had originally pawned the objects with him for thirty schillings, even though subsequently thereto A told him to pawn them with the Gentile, he must return the objects to A upon the receipt of thirty schillings; but, if both A and B admit that originally A merely sent B to pawn the objects with the Gentile, B must state under oath the amount he paid to the Gentile for the return of the objects, and must return them to A upon the receipt of such amount.</p>

Although some authorities are of the opposite opinion, the very fact that a difference of opinion exists creates a doubt as to the law; and in case of doubt we do not render a verdict to collect.</p>

Subsequently, the Gentile&#x2019;s house burned down and A&#x2019;s pledge was lost [in the flames]. Must B compensate A for this loss?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since B did not take possession of A&#x2019;s pledge, he never became responsible for its safety. Therefore, B owes nothing to A. Although the burning of A&#x2019;s pledge cancelled B&#x2019;s debt to the Gentiles (by the law of the land), and thus directly benefited B, Heaven bestowed a blessing upon him; why should he therefore share it with A?</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. Throughout the kingdom, Rashi&#x2019;s view is accepted that a <italic>Humash</italic> is not an object that is usually borrowed or hired.

However, B should be careful in taking his oath; for, if A did not actually owe him two <italic>marks</italic>, but promised to give B two <italic>marks</italic> if the latter effect a reconciliation between A and his son, A became indebted to B only for the latter&#x2019;s wages for the time and effort expended, but not for full two <italic>marks</italic>.</p>

If witnesses had seen B&#x2019;s books in A&#x2019;s possession, and if witnesses will testify that the books had been deposited with A as security against B&#x2019;s obligation to the holy cause, A will have to return the books to B.

<p><italic>A</italic>. B must take an oath in support of his denial. If it were known that B did not promise any rent to A, we should not be justified in compelling B to pay for his use of A&#x2019;s half of the house, since, as long as the house was not partitioned among the partners, B could have claimed that whenever he used any part of the house he only used his own half. On the other hand, if B did promise rent to A, he is obliged to pay it to A even if he did not use A&#x2019;s half of the house, since A did not rent his half of the house to another because of B&#x2019;s promise of rent.</p>

If A, however, does not expressly demand that B take an oath, B is free from obligation.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A demanded from B sixty pennies he owed him. B admitted the indebtedness, but claimed that through A&#x2019;s wilful neglect, he, B, was not able to collect a debt of four pounds and sixty pennies. B, therefore, demanded that A pay him four pounds. The judges ordered A to swear that he did not willfully cause any damage to B, and ordered B to swear that A did willfully cause him a loss of at least sixty pennies. After the judges rendered this decision, B put forth his claim that, in partnership with A, he, B, loaned eight and one half pounds to Gentiles, and that, without his permission or consent, A relinquished that debt to the Gentiles. A, however, claimed that B gave him permission to do with B&#x2019;s share whatever he would do with his own. Moreover, A claims that B informed against him; a Jewish witness, the servants of the Bishop, and the burghers, support A&#x2019;s claim in this respect. The judges, however, demand that their former decision be carried out and that A and B present their new claims in another suit.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The decision of the judges that A must take an oath to the effect that he did not cause B to lose his investment by willful neglect, is correct. But if A released B&#x2019;s Gentile debtors (even though B gave A a blanket permission to do with his, B&#x2019;s, share whatever he, A, would do with his own), A must pay B as much as B&#x2019;s share was worth before A released the Gentiles. B must take an oath in the presence of the Gentile witnesses that he did not inform against A, in order to counteract the testimony of the single Jewish witness.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. B is under no obligation to explain how A became indebted to him. He must merely take an oath to the effect that A legally owes him four schillings.

<p>I have heard that whenever a plaintiff, before formally relinquishing his claims against the defendant, registers his protest before witnesses and declares that the forthcoming relinquishing of his claims will be a mere pretense, the courts throughout these communities consider such relinquishing of claims null and void. They base such a decision on the talmudic statement that a protest registered against a forthcoming divorce or gift is &#x201C;a mere clarification of the situation&#x201D; (B. B. 40b), which they interpret to mean that a protest is valid in these two instances even though the person was not coerced into granting the divorce or the gift. This decision, however, is wrong and wicked, and is the greatest outrage practiced since the days of the Judges. Were this principle accepted in our law, life would be unbearable. A husband would grant a divorce to his wife in consideration of a substantial sum of money, and after pocketing the money would disclose that a protest preceded the granting of the divorce. Persons would do favors to others in consideration of gifts received from them and would later discover that protests preceded the deeds of gift. Why did Rabban Gamaliel the Elder (Git. 32a) decree that a divorce be not nullified unless the messenger or wife be notified of its nullification before the bill of divorcement reached the wife &#x2026; .?</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A was ready to take an oath denying B&#x2019;s claim. When he noticed, however, that B was going to insert in the oath a denial of a former claim B had had against him, A decided to pay B&#x2019;s present claim in order to avoid taking such an oath. Will A, upon such payment, be free from the obligation of taking an oath, or must he pay both claims before being free from this obligation?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Nowadays a person is required to take an oath whenever he denies any claims made against him, whether such denial is complete or partial, whether the claim involves immovables or movables. Therefore, the problem stated above does not exist nowadays. Let A pay B as much as he wants to pay. If B will put forth further claims against A, the latter must either pay such claims or take an oath. In former days, however, when certain claims if denied required no oath, the Rabbis differed in their opinions whether or not the defendant be required to take an oath regarding an earlier claim, in cases similar to the above.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. We cannot apply to this case the talmudic principle that he who denies having contracted a loan from another thereby admits not having repaid that loan (Shebu. 41b), for when the debtor claims that he repaid his loan and is ready to take an oath in support of his claim, the surety is automatically freed from his obligation regardless of his own admissions or denials.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. Jews who are sureties, are kind to their debtors and eat moderately at their expense.

Since according to the law of the land a creditor may collect the entire debt from one surety, even where there are other sureties, and since in such a case the law of the land must prevail, the Gentile was entitled to collect his debt from B.

<p><italic>A</italic>. B must indemnify A for all losses he suffered through his suretyship, even if the suretyship was used as a mere pretext for extortion. This is the law throughout our kingdom and is believed to be based on an ordinance of the communities. I believe, however, that it is sound talmudic law. But, A must prove the exact amount of his loss and can not collect by merely taking an oath. Even if witnesses testify that A gave a certain sum to the burgher and told him that the money was in final settlement of his suretyship for B, A must, nevertheless, swear that the money was given for that purpose only and that the burgher refused to accept a smaller amount in settlement of his claim. Only then may he collect that sum from B. If, however, A admits that the Gentile first released him from his suretyship and then returned with threats and accusations, B is free from any obligations to A.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. Since B told A that he would demand his money directly from him, A assumed unconditional responsibility for the debt and became a <italic>Kablan</italic> (B. B. 173b). Therefore, B is entitled to collect the debt directly from A.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. If B will take an oath in support of his claims, he will be free from obligation. Should A claim that he has paid his debt to the Gentile, such claim would be of no consequence. Since A did not repay the debt in B&#x2019;s presence, and since his creditor was a Gentile, who has held B directly responsible for such debt, and could still have collected it from B through the courts of the land, A was still under obligation to free B from his suretyship.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A&#x2019;s widow and son, through their representative, summoned B, A&#x2019;s brother, before us.

He demanded, therefore, that B return the horse either to the widow, in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>, or to the orphan who was the rightful heir. B claimed that he had become surety to a Gentile for a loan of five and one quarter <italic>marks</italic>, contracted by A, that A&#x2019;s wife had vowed to repay this debt and release him from his suretyship; that A had given him the wine for the purpose of selling it and buying his release with that money; that the horse was worth only three <italic>marks</italic>, and that the widow, therefore, still owed him two and one quarter <italic>marks</italic>. The representative, however, claimed that A had effected B&#x2019;s release from his suretyship. We decided, temporarily, that B should take an oath to the effect that he has as yet not been released from his suretyship and that he had received the wine for the purpose of buying such release; in which case he should be entitled to retain the horse. However, before B took the prescribed oath, he sold the horse for six pounds, which now had a value of four and one-quarter <italic>marks</italic>, and he made a settlement with the Gentile (A&#x2019;s creditor for the 5&#x00BC; <italic>marks</italic>) to pay him one <italic>mark</italic> per year for six years. B wanted to give the six pounds to his mother-in-law for investment purposes, she promising to pay the one <italic>mark</italic> per year for six years to the Gentile. The representative, however, claimed that B was in possession of an amount equal to the value of the horse only and that B must pay out of his own pocket the difference between this amount and the amount due the Gentile. He demanded that B return the six pounds to the widow and her son, who were willing to provide sureties to the Gentile guaranteeing the payment of one <italic>mark</italic> per year for six years. B, on the other hand, claimed that he was entitled to benefit from the advantageous settlement he negotiated with A&#x2019;s creditor; that being able to release himself completely from his suretyship by his shrewdness in the use of the four and one-quarter <italic>marks</italic>, he was entitled to do so; and that he was taking a risk since (the coins comprising) the six pounds were almost certain to be invalidated and be worth less than four and one quarter <italic>marks</italic>. Moreover, B claimed that A had promised to pay him for his efforts in selling the wine, and that he had guaranteed another debt of A which had not been paid. We shall follow your decision in this matter. Furthermore, please inform us whether or not B may exact an oath from the widow to the effect that she did not vow to release him from his suretyship.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B has no claim on the money he received for the horse if his complete release from his suretyship is effected in other ways, especially since he had as yet not taken the required oath. Since the widow and her son are willing to guarantee such a release, B must return that money to them. However, if B take an oath to the effect that A owed him a certain amount of money, either for his effort in selling the wine or for becoming surety for another debt, he will be entitled to retain such an amount. B may exact an oath from the widow (to the effect that she did not vow to pay the above debt of five and one-quarter <italic>marks</italic>) under the following conditions only: a) If it is an established fact that A did not effect the release of B from his suretyship; b) if B claims that the widow had made the vow mentioned above before he became surety for A. If the former condition is lacking, the widow is not required to take an oath when the claim against her is based on a doubtful premise; and if the latter condition is lacking, the widow never became responsible for that debt. If she made the vow referred to above, she is still under solemn obligation to keep her vow, but is not required to take an oath. However, the representative&#x2019;s claim that B was in possession of an amount equal to the value of the horse only, is baseless.</p>

B then interposed in C&#x2019;s behalf, became surety for him, took pledges from A (and, probably from C) and promised A by solemn hand-clasp that should C fail to appear in court and to comply with its decision, B would return the pledges to A. A believes he has witnesses to this effect, and demands the pledges from B. B, however, claims that he only guaranteed that C would return to the city before a certain date, that C did come to the city before that date, and that he (B) was thereby released from his obligation.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A, through the testimony of his witnesses, can prove his claim regarding B&#x2019;s promise by solemn hand-clasp, then B must fulfill his promise, since promises made by solemn handclasp must be fulfilled. But, if A has no witnesses, B is free from obligation and does not even have to take an oath. Furthermore, B&#x2019;s suretyship was of no value, since a suretyship entered into after the original transaction had been completed, is not binding.</p>

<p>Q. When B went out of town, the officer of the town stationed guards at his house in order to make sure that neither his wife, his children, nor his valuables would be removed from town. Three days later B&#x2019;s wife came to A and implored him to go surety for her to the officer, and to guaranty that neither she, her children, nor their valuables would be removed from town, until her husband returned and personally gave security to the officer that he would not move out of the overlord&#x2019;s territory. When subsequently B returned to town, A told him of his suretyship. B thanked A and commended him for having kept the guards out of his house. Then the overlord of the town, the king&#x2019;s highest officer, came and heaped accusations on B for having gone to dwell in another town &#x2014; though this town was also a royal town and, therefore, under his jurisdiction &#x2014; saying: &#x201C;I know that you intend to flee from my territory&#x201D;. B, realizing that the officer had falsely accused him before the overlord, asked the dignitaries of two towns to induce the overlord to permit him to move into another town under his jurisdiction. When permission was granted, A&#x2019;s relative informed him that B was planning to move out of the overlord&#x2019;s territory. A protested to B&#x2019;s wife that he would be held responsible by the officer for such a move on B&#x2019;s part. B&#x2019;s wife reminded him that the overlord released B&#x2019;s sureties from obligation, but A pointed out that he had gone surety to the officer, and that the latter did not release him. B&#x2019;s wife, therefore, vowed and obligated herself by solemn hand clasp that in case the officer should inculpate A, and in case B should not compensate him for all ensuing losses, she would herself compensate him, up to twenty pounds, out of her clothes and jewels, without a court action. Subsequently B moved out of town, A was inculpated and incarcerated, and was forced to pay thirty pounds for his release. A, therefore, demands the thirty pounds from B.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A husband must redeem his wife even when the ransom asked is larger than her value (as a slave), and must pay his wife&#x2019;s debts which she contracted, for the purpose of buying her release. A person who goes surety for another must be compensated for all ensuing losses. Consequently, B must compensate A for his losses.</p>

The latter&#x2019;s servants kept constant watch over her not letting her take a single step outside of her house without their permission. She asked A to go surety for her to the officer. A complied with her wishes, and she was released. The officer, however, made unjust and extravagant demands on A, with which demands he was forced to comply. A now demands that B make good the losses he has suffered because of his suretyship.</p>

When B&#x2019;s wife asked A to ransom her, she assumed responsibility for all damages A might suffer on this account.

A averred that he had bought the property from L&#x2019;s father-in-law, that he could produce the deed as proof, and that he could prove through witnesses a long period of undisturbed possession. A was then asked to produce the deed. The deed showed, however, that after the death of L&#x2019;s father-in-law, A bought the property from L&#x2019;s mother-in-law to whom the court had adjudged such property in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A&#x2019;s window is narrow on the inside and wide on the outside. B, his neighbor, wants to build a wall alongside A&#x2019;s wall and extend it, as far as he is permitted, up to A&#x2019;s window. But, what is considered the window proper? Is it the narrow, inside, opening or the wide, outside, opening? We are inclined to the opinion that the wide, outside, opening is the window proper; some of our Rabbis (colleagues) disagree with us but their reasons for disagreeing are not convincing. Therefore, we want your opinion.</p>
<p>Signed: Eliezer b. Shlumiel, Mordecai b. Joseph, Simon Solomon b. Baruch.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The narrow part of the window is the window proper, for two reasons. First, anything a person can build in his house without his neighbor being able to object to it, can not be used as a restriction on such neighbor when he wants to build on his own property. Secondly, a person may increase his lights by beveling the outside border of his window as long as he does not touch the inside border of the window (or vice versa) without his neighbor being able to object to it. Surely one may make his wall very thin without his neighbor being able to object to it; the thinning of the wall has the same effect on the visibility of the window as the bevelling of the border of the window. If one is permissible, so is the other. The neighbor, then, cannot be restrained from placing his wall exactly in the same position he could have placed it before the person widened the outside of his window. B, therefore, may extend his wall up to one <italic>tefah</italic> of the narrow part of A&#x2019;s window.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. B erected a building alongside of A&#x2019;s windows, thus shutting out the light from his windows. As soon as A learned about it, he protested vigorously. B, however, refuses to remove his building, claiming that A&#x2019;s protests are of no avail since the building had been completed long before A protested.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. An abutter is not permitted to build a wall within four cubits of his neighbor&#x2019;s windows without the latter&#x2019;s permission. Therefore, B must remove the aforesaid building, for A protested as soon as he learned about its erection. Moreover, should B produce witnesses to the effect that A failed to protest immediately after he learned of the erection of B&#x2019;s building, it would avail B nothing as long as he does not claim to have bought, or to have received as a gift, the right to erect the building. Undisturbed possession in itself is of no legal consequence, unless it be accompanied by a claim of having once legally acquired the disputed right.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A constructed apertures for windows in his house which bordered on a Gentile&#x2019;s property. A had a right to construct these windows, while the Gentile had a right to build a wall immediately in front of these windows and obstruct their view, since according to the law of the country, a person may build anything he wants on his own property, regardless of his neighbor&#x2019;s conveniences. Some years later, the Gentile sold his property to a Jew, B, and specified in the bill of sale, which bore the burghers&#x2019; seal, that B had a right to build a wall and obstruct the view of A&#x2019;s windows. Now B demands that A board up his windows, while A claims the right to these window lights because of the law of usucapion.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B could not buy from the Gentile any rights the Gentile himself did not possess. Therefore, since according to the law of the country one may build on his property whatever he pleases, B may build a wall on his property and obstruct the view of A&#x2019;s windows; but he can not compel A to board up his windows. However, if A claims that he bought the right to construct the apertures for the windows, he must produce documentary evidence or witnesses to support his claim, no matter how many years expired since the construction of his windows, since the law of usucapion is not valid when the original possessor of the right is a Gentile.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. B bought property from a Gentile which bordered on A&#x2019;s property. Before paying for it, B, to acquire possession, did some digging in the Gentile&#x2019;s yard in the presence of witnesses. After B did so, but before he had paid the money to the Gentile, A constructed apertures for windows in his wall facing the property. Did A acquire rights to window lights?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. In city property digging is not considered a valid act of possession. Likewise A did not acquire any rights to window lights since a Gentile does not renounce his rights to his property before he receives the money, and the Gentile&#x2019;s property was, therefore, not (<italic>res nullis</italic>) ownerless. However, before paying money to the Gentile, let B perform a valid act of possession (such as locking a door, fixing or breaking part of the fence, etc.); otherwise A will acquire rights to window lights during the interval between the paying of the money and B&#x2019;s taking formal possession, since during such interval the Gentile&#x2019;s property will be <italic>res nullis</italic>.</p>

Subsequently, however, he said that he had been informed that this wall had been built by his grandfather from whom he had inherited his property.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since A first admitted that the wall belonged to his neighbor, his admission carried more weight than the subsequent testimony of witnesses. Since A had already reached his majority when his grandfather died, and thus should have known all the particulars regarding his inheritance, his admission regarding the ownership of the wall was valid, and he may no longer retract it.</p>

B wanted to build another wall in line with the edge of this foundation, the wall to extend two hand-breadths beyond the existing wall. A protested vigorously claiming that B&#x2019;s property ended at the edge of the wall of the building mentioned above, and that the foundation of such building extended two hand-breadths in his (A&#x2019;s) property.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since B was in undisturbed possession of the width of the foundation, he was thus in possession of the disputed two hand-breadths of ground along the whole length of the property, and upwards reaching into the sky. Therefore, if B will take an oath to the effect that he did not remove his neighbor&#x2019;s landmark [when the foundation was built], the disputed two hand-breadths of ground will belong to him. Although according to Biblical law no oath is administered in disputes involving real property, such an oath is required by Rabbinic enactment.</p>

He, therefore, demanded that A fill up his ditch. A claimed that the ditch had been in his yard for a period of twenty-four years and that B had never protested before. B, however, contended that the ditch had not previously caused him any damage. A&#x2019;s father bought the property with the ditch from a Jew who, in turn, had bought it from a Gentile.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A removes his ditch one <italic>tefah</italic> from B&#x2019;s wall, he is free from further obligation. But even if A does not do so, he is free from any obligation since he inherited the ditch from his father, who, if alive, could claim that he bought the right to maintain the ditch from B. Moreover, A is not required to take an oath to the effect that he never heard his father say that he did not buy from B (or B&#x2019;s father) the right to maintain the ditch for the following reasons: <italic>a</italic>) Orphans are not required to take an oath in order to free themselves from a money obligation; b) the oath of orphans is a rabbinical decree and the Rabbis did not decree anything disadvantageous to the interests of the orphans.</p>
<p>The fact that A&#x2019;s yard originally belonged to a Gentile, has nothing to do with the case since B does not claim that the Gentile dug the ditch illegally. If B does put forth the claim that the Gentile dug the ditch illegally, it will avail him nothing, since, again, the court will have to put forth the claim, for A&#x2019;s benefit, that A&#x2019;s father bought the right to maintain the ditch from B or B&#x2019;s predecessors.</p>

His son, A, bought one-third of his brother B&#x2019;s part, and C bought another third. One-eighth of the property is large enough to form a &#x201C;usable unit.&#x201D;<xref rid="fn5">&#x002A;</xref> A demands that it be partitioned in such a manner that he, A, receive his own part and the part he bought, as one unit. This division would be in accord with the rabbinical ordinance that upon division of property held in partnership, a partner should receive his part as one unit. C, however, desiring to block the partition of the property, is determined to waive the rabbinical ordinance originally intended in his favor, and demands that the part he bought from his brother be given to him separately. This would make the partition impossible, since one twenty-fourth of the property is too small a part to be used separately.</p>
<p>2. <italic>Q</italic>. The house is situated near the public thoroughfare and its northern door opens into the thoroughfare; while the yard extends south of the house, away from the thoroughfare. Upon partitioning this house among the heirs, one heir would receive the more valuable front entrance, while the other would have to open up a door into the alley on the western side. Moreover, a square cubit of ground in the northern part of the yard, near the public thoroughfare, has double the value of a square cubit in the southern part of the yard, away from the thoroughfare. How, then, can this house be properly partitioned among the heirs?</p>
<p>3. <italic>Q</italic>. Is the thickness of a wall, which can not be reduced without weakening the entire building, to be considered as space when the house is partitioned among heirs?</p>

<p>1) <italic>A</italic>. C can not refuse to abide by a rabbinical ordinance, even though it was made in his favor, when such refusal inconveniences the other heirs.</p>
<p>2) <italic>A</italic>. To answer this question one must know exactly the plan of the property. However, one must keep in mind the following rule: The advantages that some parts of said property have over other parts can be divided into two classes: a) positional advantages that can not be changed, i.e., some parts are near the street, others are away from it; b) artificial advantages caused by the presence of buildings, rooms, and doors in some parts, and their absence in others. Therefore, regarding the greater value of some parts of said property because of positional advantages, the size of each part should be, upon partitioning, inversely proportional to its value, thus equalizing the value of each part. As regard the greater value of some parts because of artificial advantages, the heir receiving the more valuable part should pay the difference, in money, to the heir receiving the less valuable part, for with the money he receives the latter may so improve his part so as to have all the advantages the former has in his part.</p>

A and B demand that the property be divided among the partners. Should the property be so divided, some of the partners would receive parts that are not &#x201C;usable&#x201D; [i.e., an area smaller than six cubits by four cubits].</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Those partners who are to receive a &#x201C;usable&#x201D; part may divide the house and courtyard in such a way that each of them receives his individual part, while the other partners hold the remaining parts jointly. Thus if F and G, are each to receive a part that is not &#x201C;usable&#x201D;, they may be forced to hold jointly one eighth of the house and courtyard. F may not demand that he be given his part separately, even though such part be not &#x201C;usable.&#x201D; Such a demand, if heeded, would leave G with a part that is not &#x201C;usable&#x201D; thus making the entire division impossible; we may use force in the case of a vicious (lit.

<p><italic>A</italic>. The Talmud records a difference of opinion on this subject between the Rabbis who decided in the affirmative and Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel who decided in the negative. Some post-talmudic authorities accept the former opinion, while others accept the latter. The talmudic discussion of the opinion of R. Simeon b. Gamaliel, however, leads us to accept the opinion of the Rabbis.</p>
<p>d) The thickness of a wall which cannot be reduced without weakening the building, is not to be considered as space. If thinning of such wall, however, would not seriously weaken the building, and the extra space thus gained would provide each partner with a &#x201C;usable&#x201D; unit, thus making a division possible, such a wall ought to be thinned accordingly, since people customarily thin walls for purposes of utility.</p>
<p>e) <italic>Q</italic>. Should the partner, who owns one-sixteenth of the property, receive his portion at the extreme end of the courtyard, away from the public thoroughfare, he would receive a &#x201C;usable&#x201D; unit. Should he receive part of the house near the public thoroughfare as his portion, he would not receive a &#x201C;usable&#x201D; unit. If said partner objects to a division of the property, may the other partners nevertheless divide the property in the hope that the extreme end of the courtyard would fall to his lot?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If upon receiving his portion midway between the house and the extreme end of the courtyard, the protesting partner would receive a &#x201C;usable&#x201D; unit, the partners may divide the property.</p>

For these measurements, the talmudic cubit of twenty-four thumb-breadths should be used. Even though such partition might leave C, D and E with parts smaller than this minimum, A would still be entitled to effect a partition of the property since before Jacob sold his share to C, D, and E each partner (A, B and Jacob) would have been entitled to a &#x201C;usable unit.&#x201D; Moreover, A could have forced Jacob to agree to a partition even if he, A, would not have received a &#x201C;usable unit.&#x201D; The restriction upon partners not to partition a house unless each partner receives a &#x201C;usable unit&#x201D;, was decreed by the Rabbis for the benefit of those partners who were to receive the smaller parts.

<p><italic>A</italic>. Since, while B was alive, the house was large enough to be divided among the three partners, and if A had then demanded a division, B&#x2019;s objection thereto would have been of no avail, B&#x2019;s sons may not now restrain A from effecting such a division. They can inherit no rights from B that he himself did not possess. The division of a house among partners should be executed by experts in one of two ways. a) Each partner should receive a part of the house proportional, in size, to his share while the difference between the value of such part and the money value of his share should be adjusted by the payment or receipt of money. b) Each partner should receive an appropriate part of the house inversely proportional, in size, to its intrinsic value, so that the estimated value of such part be exactly equal to the money value of his share.</p>

Complying with C&#x2019;s demand A deposited a pledge of ten pounds with B to be delivered to C in case A did not keep his promise. A&#x2019;s neighbors agreed to buy the house for the price mentioned above. Meanwhile, A received money from a different source and after a conference with his relatives, he refused to sell the house altogether. A&#x2019;s neighbors summoned him to court claiming that he tricked them and that he used them as a means to free himself from his obligation to C. A, therefore, had to take an oath (in the form of a <italic>herem</italic>) that he had no intentions of trickery. Subsequently, with his pledge still in the hands of the trustee, B, A went to the Rabbis of a certain community and explained the situation to them. The Rabbis informed him that he did not lose his pledge since the consent of the neighbors to buy his house automatically voided his agreement with C. A, therefore, now demands his pledge from B. B, however, claims that A&#x2019;s agreement with C was that if A&#x2019;s neighbors did not buy his house by a certain date, A would sell it to C or forfeit the pledge. A single witness supports B&#x2019;s claim. B further claims that after the appointed time passed he delivered the pledge to C as instructed. Signed: Judah b. Rabbi Meshulam.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A&#x2019;s agreement to give C ten pounds in case he, A, does not keep his promise, is considered an <italic>Asmakta</italic>; and since the agreement was not made in the presence of an authoritative court, and was not accompanied by a <italic>Kinyan</italic>, it is not binding. A promised C by solemn hand-clasp to sell him the house, but no such hand-clasp accompanied A&#x2019;s agreement to pay the fine of ten pounds; therefore, A is under no obligation to pay ten pounds to C. And, since according to A&#x2019;s report of his agreement with C such agreement was voided by the neighbor&#x2019;s consent to buy the house, A is under no obligation to C, and B must return to A his ten pounds. The testimony of the single witness &#x2014; that A promised by solemn hand-clasp to sell his house to C if his neighbors would not buy it by a certain date &#x2014; does not oblige A to take an oath denying the truth of such testimony. For a solemn hand-clasp is equivalent to an oath; thus, if the testimony of the witness is true, A is already under a solemn obligation to sell his house to C and an oath is unnecessary.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A house belonged to three or four partners, one of whom was Leah. An abutting house was sold to Rachel. Leah wanted to buy the latter house and asserted her priority rights as an abutter. Indeed the Talmud rules (B.M. 108b) that an abutter may not assert priority rights, if the buyer is a woman. This law may not apply, however, when the abutter is also a woman.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A sold his ground, which bordered on B&#x2019;s property, to C for a sum of money plus C&#x2019;s share in a piece of ground C held in partnership with D in another part of town. After the sale was completed and the title conveyed, B pressed his rights as an abutter. Since Maimonides rules that the law of preemption does not apply to the case where a person exchanges his immovables for the immovables of another, C was advised to persuade A to refuse to accept from B, in payment of A&#x2019;s ground, anything but the particular piece of ground A was to receive from C. Accordingly A claimed that C&#x2019;s piece of ground was very precious to him and that he valued it like the &#x201C;estate of Bar Marion&#x201D; (B.B. 12b). B, therefore, bought from D his share of the particular ground he held in partnership with C, and offered it to A in lieu of C&#x2019;s share of the same ground. C, however, objected to D&#x2019;s sale claiming that upon the voiding of his transaction with A he would return to his former status as D&#x2019;s partner, and, having the right of preemption on D&#x2019;s share, he would buy such share leaving nothing to A. A and C employed many other tricks and artifices in order to void B&#x2019;s right of preemption.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since C bought A&#x2019;s ground and gave away his own ground in partial payment thereof, he no longer owns the latter ground. Since a person who buys real property desired by an abutter, merely acts as the agent of such abutter (B.B. 108a), C must deliver to B the ground he bought from A, receiving in exchange the ground B bought from D plus a refund of his money. Were B unable to acquire such ground from D, he would have repaid C with money for the ground C gave to A; the value of such ground would have been determined by experts and not by C. C would not have been able to claim that his ground was very precious to him having for him the value of the &#x201C;estate of Bar Marion&#x201D;, for such claim is valid only when a person is seeking to take away the property of another (in exchange of his own) against the will of the latter who may plead that his property is very precious to him. But in our case C has sold his property to A, and is only entitled to its market price. Moreover, even if the aforementioned sale were not concluded as yet, and an understanding merely existed between A and C that C convey his ground to A on condition that the conveyance of A&#x2019;s ground be without any interference on the part of the abutters, A could not have insisted on exchanging his ground for ground exactly similar to that of C. A could not have attached special importance to C&#x2019;s ground as having the value for him of the &#x201C;estate of Bar Marion&#x201D;, for the reason already stated. Therefore, B would have been able to pay A with other ground, located in the same town, of equal value as that of C. Many persons have the erroneous notion that the preemptive right of an abutter is void whenever an exchange or real property is involved. Were this true, the parties to a sale of immovables would always add a small piece of ground to the purchasing price in order to place the transaction in the category of exchange of real property, thus turning into a hollow mockery the ordinance of the Rabbis who created the law of preemption for humane reasons. Therefore, whenever we suspect that the circumstances of a sale of real property were specially arranged in order to circumvent the law of preemption, we sustain the preemptive right of the abutter.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A sold his house to his son-in-law, B, and to the latter&#x2019;s small children of a previous marriage. The actual sale, however, was concluded between A and C, since C acted as agent for B and B&#x2019;s children. At the conclusion of the sale, C delivered pledges to A. Thereupon, A&#x2019;s neighbors, D and E, summoned A to court asserting their priority rights as abutters, and demanded that A sell the house to them at the same price he was to receive from B and that he take the necessary steps to convey title to them in the courts of the land. E further claimed that the above house was mortgaged to him for over a year, and that he thus asserted his priority rights thereto both as a mortgagor and as an abutter. A averred that he had sold the house to B on condition that should the abutters assert their priority rights, the sale would be void. The witnesses to the sale, however, testified that no such condition was stipulated by A. A, however, claimed that he had sold the house to B at a low price, because B was his son-in-law; that when he learned that the abutters were anxious to buy the house, he refused to sell it altogether; and that he returned the pledges to C and thus annulled the sale. The abutters asserted, however, that when C took back the pledges, he warned A that he did not thus intend to annul the sale proper; and that A answered that he did not attach much importance to C&#x2019;s intentions in the matter, since C merely acted as a deputy. The abutters further claimed that by his cunning moves A merely intended to gain a higher price for his house. We ruled, therefore, that the abutters have no claim against A. The abutters do have a claim against B; but since they did not summon B before us, we dismissed the case.</p>
<p>Signed: Isaac b. Prigores, Ephraim b. Judah.</p>
<p>I am sending you this decision because I believe that the judges have erred. I showed Rabbi Isaac b. Prigores your Responsum in connection with the case of R. S. haLevi, his sons, and his son-in-law R. Isaac Gabbi, to the effect that a buyer merely acts as the abutter&#x2019;s deputy, and that the formal transfer (<italic>kinyan</italic>) of the real property from the seller to the buyer in reality transfers the property to the abutter. Rabbi Isaac, however, gave me unsatisfactory answers. Therefore, please let me know your opinion in the matter, for no deed is more worthy than establishing truth and justice in this world. Please explain to us the law in all its details, and write your answer on the reverse of this sheet. The court&#x2019;s decision was written by the judges at the order of the <italic>parnasim</italic> (community leaders) who were interested in dispensing justice and righteousness. You need not hesitate [therefore], for your decision will be accepted and enforced. The Lord will soon release you from captivity. Your servant, Abraham b. Eliezer haLevi.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The evasions of both A and the judges, are to no avail. The buyer merely acted as the abutters&#x2019; deputy, and the aforesaid <italic>kinyan</italic> conveyed the house to the abutters. Therefore the latter have a claim against anyone now holding the house, whether seller or buyer, and may force A to take all necessary steps in conveying title to them in the courts of the land; for this is an implied obligation on the part of a seller. The fact that part of the house was sold to B&#x2019;s children, who were minors, was also of no consequence, since the minors took no active part in the formal transfer of ownership. As to your question regarding the priority rights of a mortgagor as against those of an abutter, a mortgagor of more than one year&#x2019;s standing has priority rights as against an abutter.</p>

<h1><bold>519</bold></h1>
<p>1) <italic>Q</italic>. May a person bestow, as a gift, on his son or son-in-law part of a certain piece of real estate, a part worth ten <italic>marks</italic> out of a piece of real estate worth one hundred and sixty <italic>marks</italic>, and subsequently sell to this son or son-in-law, who would thus be a partner to the property, the remainder of the real estate for a higher price than its actual worth (namely for the original one hundred and sixty <italic>marks</italic>) in order to evade intervention by the abutter?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the donor sold the remainder of the real estate to the donee for less than the actual value of the entire piece of real estate (for less than 160 <italic>marks</italic>), the donee was thus in reality a partner in the property, and, therefore, had priority rights over the abutter. Otherwise, the donation was a mere fraud, and did not give the donee any priority rights to the property.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. Which clause in a deed of gift renders the gift a &#x201C;donation with guaranteed title&#x201D;, the clause: &#x201C;and I will compensate thee &#x2026;&#x201D;, or the final clause: &#x201C;and I assume full responsibility for this deed of gift &#x2026;&#x201D;? Is the presence of the latter clause by itself sufficient? Does the fact that the witnesses to the deed of gift claim to have written the final clause of their own accord, without having consulted the donor, affect its validity?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The final clause mentioned above is in itself sufficient to render the gift a &#x201C;donation with guaranteed title.&#x201D; Under the circumstances, we lend no credence to the statement of the witnesses, for a verbal statement of the witnesses does not discredit the bond which bears their signatures.</p>
<p>3) <italic>Q</italic>. A owns a quarter interest in a piece of real estate which abuts his property. The other three quarters belong to C. The latter seeks to sell one quarter of the real estate to a woman, or to orphans. One quarter of such real estate, however, does not form a &#x201C;usable part.&#x201D; May A object to the sale on the ground that, although he can now force C to partition the real estate between them even though he, A, is entitled to receive a &#x201C;non-usable part&#x201D;, he will not be able to force a division later when the woman or the orphans will be entitled to receive a &#x201C;non-usable part&#x201D;?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. C cannot sell to another any right he does not possess himself. Since C may not restrain A from dividing the property, those who buy any part thereof from C may not do so either. Incidentally, you specified that the buyer in the above transaction was to be a woman or orphans. You probably thought that against such buyers A would not be able to assert his priority rights as a partner. However, this is not so; for, unlike an abutter, a partner may assert his priority rights even when the buyer is a woman or an orphan.</p>
<p>4) <italic>Q</italic>. The shape of a piece of ground held by partners is such that if it should be divided in one way, each partner would receive a &#x201C;usable part&#x201D;; but if it should be divided in another way, one partner would not receive a &#x201C;usable part&#x201D;, and thus no division would be possible. May a partner insist on the first method of division, in order to force the division of the property among the partners?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Yes, he may.</p>
<p>5) <italic>Q</italic>. If buildings obstruct the proper division of real estate among partners, are the buildings to be disregarded?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Walls must be thinned or completely removed, if necessary, in order to effect a proper division among partners while, at the same time, damage to the property should be held to a minimum. The difference in value between parts, however, should be adjusted by having the partner who received the more valuable part, pay the difference to the partner who received the less valuable part.</p>
<p>6) <italic>Q</italic>. When the property is divided among the partners, may A demand that he be given a part adjacent to his own property?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Authorities hold conflicting opinions regarding this law. Therefore, A may not insist on receiving a part adjacent to his property.</p>
<p>7) <italic>Q</italic>. What constitutes a &#x201C;usable part&#x201D;?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A &#x201C;usable part&#x201D; is a piece of real estate four cubits by six cubits.</p>
<p>8) <italic>Q</italic>. If two partners own a house that has only a single door opening into the street and cannot have another, how may such a house be divided among the partners?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The partner who receives the front part of the house must allow the other partner to use the front door.</p>
<p>9) <italic>Q</italic>. May A, who owns a quarter interest in the house, rent out a quarter of each room to a different lodger?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A and C can come to no agreement regarding a proper division of the house, they may use it in one of the following ways: a) A may use the entire house for one year out of each four years, and C may use it for the remaining three years. b) The house may be rented to a tenant, one quarter of its rent will go to A, and the rest will go to C; (c) one partner may force the other either to pay him a certain amount for his share, or receive a proportionate payment for his own share.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. One part of a room is held in partnership by B, C, and D, and the other part belongs solely to A. B and C own estates which border on the east side of the room. When the partners are ready to partition the room with A, can they compel A to take the west part of the room so that B and C may have their own part, which they intend to continue to hold in partnership, contiguous to their estates?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. According to the opinion of Rashi, the partners may compel A to take the west part of the room; R. Tam, however, thinks that they cannot do so. Since we cannot decide whose opinion should prevail, we must order A and the partners to cast lots; if the east part of the room falls to the partners, they shall gain title to it; but if the east part falls to A, he shall not gain title to it immediately, but whatever person or persons can by force succeed in taking possession of the east part that person or persons shall gain title to it.</p>
<p>This Responsum was addressed to R. Meir&#x2019;s relative, Rabbi Joel.</p>
<p>The latter objected to R. Meir&#x2019;s ruling that the use of force be invoked in settling the above dispute, on the ground that this procedure would lead to serious quarrels.</p>
<p>R. Meir answered: In order to obviate the necessity of leaving the matter to be settled by force, I searched for a more practical solution and found that Maimonides in his code ruled that upon the partitioning of a field held in partnership, a partner may insist on receiving his part of the field adjoining his own property, provided that both parts of the field are exactly equal [in fertility or arrangement of irrigation facilities]. Therefore, if B, C, and D, agree to equalize the two parts of the room by adding structures to the western side of the room similar to the ones in the eastern side, they will be entitled to receive as their share the eastern part of the room. This ruling is in accordance with the views of both Rashi and Maimonides. In the present case we may disregard the view of R. Tam since it is contradicted by the two authorities, and since their interpretation of the pertinent talmudic source is more acceptable to our way of thinking.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. B bought from a Gentile woman a house bordering on A&#x2019;s property. B agreed that the woman could remain in the house till the month of <italic>Heshvan</italic> (October). A and C claim that they were negotiating to buy the house before B appeared on the scene; that A has a partnership in the house since the beams of his house project into the wall of the Gentile&#x2019;s house; that the Gentile owed money to A; that B promised them not to buy the house; that the arbitrators reported to A and C, B&#x2019;s statement to the effect that A and C need not be concerned, and could rely on his word as a Jew that he would not buy the house; that the Gentile gave A and C the keys to her house, and that they opened it, measured the size and noted the arrangement of the rooms, the exits, and the entrances, and locked it, before B bought the house. They, therefore, demand that B transfer the house to them. B avers that he never promised A and C not to buy the house; and that he had negotiated to buy the house long before they did. The Gentile woman claims that A inserted his beams into her wall illegally.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A and C cannot force B to transfer the house to them, for the following reasons: a) B denies having promised A and C not to buy the house; b) if B did make such a promise to A and C, and then broke it he might be called <italic>Rasha</italic> (wicked) or <italic>Abaryana</italic> (renegade), but we can not force him to transfer the house to A and C; therefore, no useful purpose will be served by imposing an oath on B regarding such promise; c) although locking a house is considered a valid act of possession, and one may gain title to the property of a Gentile by taking possession thereof (Bechorot 13a), this rule applies only when such an act is accompanied by proper intention by both parties. However, before the two parties agree on the terms of the sale no such intention is possible; therefore, A&#x2019;s locking of the Gentile&#x2019;s house was of no consequence; d) the fact that the Gentile owed money to A does not vest in him the priority rights of an abutter, for, only a creditor who has a mortgage on a house, lives therein, and has a lease thereon so that he cannot be made to move before the year is up has the right of an abutter. Moreover, since A&#x2019;s property borders on that of the Gentile, B may assert: &#x201C;I have driven away a lion from your neighborhood&#x201D;, and such assertion annuls the priority rights A could have claimed as an abutter, as a creditor, or as a partner; e) B&#x2019;s statement to the arbitrators constituted neither an oath nor a vow, but a mere assurance. Even if we agree with A, who has construed that statement to mean an oath, B may not be forced to transfer his house to A merely because he disregarded his oath. Thus A is not entitled to indemnity. Indeed, B should be fined for his sinful act (breaking his oath), but we do not have the authority to impose penalties. However, you, my teacher, and your community, if you find that a disgraceful breach of conduct was committed, you may impose a proper fine upon B, the money to go to charity. Finally, half of B&#x2019;s wall, upon which the ends of A&#x2019;s beams are resting, belongs to A; for, the presence of such beams is ample proof that the wall was held in partnership by the two neighbors.</p>
<p>The question was again referred to Rabbi Meir who answered: Since the judges did not clearly understand my last statement, I shall explain. If A claims that half of the wall and half of the ground it rests on belongs to him, we uphold his claim since the fact that his beams rest on the wall corroborates his statement, and no witness or witnesses contradict him. A is not required to take an oath, not even a <italic>gilgul shebuah</italic> (oath of implication) in support of his claim. If A, however, admits that the Gentile woman had built the entire wall on her grounds, but that he subsequently persuaded her to permit his placing of his beams on her wall, no part of the wall belongs to him; for the Gentile merely permitted him to place his beams on her wall, but she gave him no part of the wall itself.</p>
<p>I have considered your inquiry regarding a proper punishment for B who, you claim, is a righteous, reputable and blameless person. He, indeed, must suffer severe punishment in order duly to atone for his sin; for when a person of his character commits a shameful act, he profanes the name of the Lord. However, if B is a scholar, he should not be put under the ban, but should be required to give a certain sum to the charity chest, or for the support of your students, the amount of the fine to be determined by the leaders (of the community).</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. One quarter of a house belongs to A, and the other three quarters to B. A, needing money, negotiated a loan from a Gentile, who was willing to put up a mortgage of fifteen <italic>marks</italic> on A&#x2019;s part of the house on the following conditions: 1) That A pay the Gentile one <italic>mark</italic> per annum in perpetuity; 2) that in case A fails to pay the one <italic>mark</italic> per annum, the mortgaged part of the house is to belong to the Gentile; 3) that in case the house burns down, the ground shall be mortgaged to the Gentile on the same condition; and 4) that in case A wants to sell his part of the house, the Gentile is to have the privilege of buying it at twelve (?) <italic>marks</italic> less than the offer of the highest bidder. Before concluding this transaction, A informed B of his intentions and of the Gentile&#x2019;s terms, and offered to borrow the amount from B on the same terms. B vigorously protested against A&#x2019;s mortgaging part of the house to a Gentile who might cause B trouble; but, at the same time, he refused to lend fifteen <italic>marks</italic> to A on the ground that it would be considered a taxable loan, and that the one <italic>mark</italic> per annum would be considered usury from a fellow Jew.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A sells his part of the house to B on condition that it be rented to A in perpetuity at one <italic>mark</italic> per annum, the sale will be legal and B will be permitted to collect the one <italic>mark</italic> per annum.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. When the fence, which separates A&#x2019;s yard from that of his Gentile neighbor, broke down, the Gentile rebuilt the fence on A&#x2019;s property and wrested from A a piece of ground two yards wide and twenty yards long. A was afraid to protest as the Gentile was a violent man. Subsequently, B bought the Gentile&#x2019;s property without A&#x2019;s knowledge or consent. A, therefore, demands that B return to him the piece of property which the Gentile wrongfully acquired from him since title to real property cannot be acquired by violence, and that property, therefore, still belongs to A. B refuses to do so. Furthermore, he is about to rent the property to Gentile occupants.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The principle that title to real property cannot be acquired by violence refers only to the realm of <italic>Mitzvot</italic> (religious acts) but not to the realm of commerce. Therefore, though the Gentile took A&#x2019;s ground by force and violence, he, nevertheless, gained title to it by taking possession and building a fence on it. The sale of such property to B was valid and B is under no obligation to A. B, however, should not rent the property to Gentile occupants.</p>
<p>(2). <italic>Q</italic>. B claims that A constructed apertures for window lights facing his (B&#x2019;s) yard after he (B) bought the yard from the Gentile. A claims that those windows were always in their present place, but that they were closed by wooden boards because he did not want the Gentile to look into his house. He wants to keep those windows open now that he has a Jewish neighbor.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A cannot reopen his windows, since B does not want A to be able to look into his (B&#x2019;s) yard.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. As I have already explained in my other letter, the fact that the tower is built on A&#x2019;s foundations shows that the ground also belongs to A. B can not claim undisturbed possession as evidence of title since, deriving his rights from Gentiles, he is in the same category as a Gentile and has no presumptive right of title. B&#x2019;s sons also lack such right, nor do we claim in their favor that perhaps their father bought from A the right to erect his buildings, since they are in the category of &#x201C;sons of a robber.&#x201D; Since B&#x2019;s sons do not claim that B bought from A in their presence the right to erect his buildings, but merely state that the burghers claimed to have built the tower legally, B&#x2019;s sons must either remove their buildings from the ground in question or come to terms with A.</p>

<p>1) <italic>Q</italic>. Ten Jewish adult males were inhabitants of the town of T. One of them wanted to leave [temporarily for the holidays]. His leaving would disrupt congregational prayers. Could the other members compel him to remain?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. It is an accepted custom throughout the Diaspora for small communities to hire one or two adult males whenever it is necessary to complete a <italic>minyan</italic> (quorum) for the high holidays. Therefore, if there are exactly ten adult males in the community, the other remaining members can compel the member seeking to leave either to remain in town or to hire somebody else in his stead. But, if there are eleven adult males in the community, no single member can be restrained from leaving; for he does not have to provide for the possibility of another member becoming sick or indisposed. However, if two out of the eleven want to leave, both have to share the expenses of hiring a person to complete the <italic>minyan</italic>.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. When nine Jews have to hire a tenth in order to complete the <italic>minyan</italic> (quorum), or when they have to hire a cantor for the holidays, do the members share equally in expenses, or do they pay in proportion to their wealth?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since the members do not join a large community for the high-holyday prayers because they do not want to leave their homes, their possessions, and their investments, the forming of the local <italic>minyan</italic> is dependent upon monetary considerations, and the expenses thereof should be shared by the members in proportion to their wealth.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A, who owns a share in the synagogue, is a quarrelsome and factious person. May the community expel him from its membership and demand that he either receive a certain amount for his share in the synagogue, or pay the community a proportionate amount for its share therein?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. I hold a tradition that Rabbenu Gershom, the light of the exile, instituted an ordinance that no Jew should be permanently expelled from the synagogue nor &#x201C;be driven from cleaving unto the inheritance of the Lord&#x201D; (Sam. I 26, 19) except for a period of a week, two weeks, or a month. If a person is habitually quarrelsome he should be made to pay a fine, and in case he proves disobedient or altogether rebellious, the community should have a right to get Gentiles to flog him till he become submissive. Your community, therefore, cannot expel A from the synagogue. Many violent and powerful Jews in our midst, if given an opportunity, would seek to evade payment of taxes, but they are coerced into obedience through Gentiles or our resorting to threats of excommunication. A should be dealt with in the same manner.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Dissension runs high in our community; our members can come to no agreement and cannot unanimously elect their leaders. One says one thing, another says another. Because of this disagreement the daily service is interrupted; justice cannot be carried out; neither truth, nor judgment, nor peace prevails in this town or throughout the kingdom that is dependent on it. What shall we do?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. All members who pay taxes shall come together to form an assembly. Each member must first take an oath to the effect that whatever he shall say or do shall be motivated solely by a desire to sanctify God&#x2019;s name and to further the interests of the community. Thereafter, a majority vote of this assembly shall be binding on the whole community. This shall apply to the election of officers, appointment of cantors, or the creation of a charity chest and selection of its officers. It shall likewise be decided by majority vote whether to build or destroy aught in the synagogue, to buy a community wedding-hall or bakery, or to provide all other community needs. Should the minority refuse to heed the decision of the majority, this majority, or its appointed officers, shall use coercive force, whether through Jewish law or the law of the land, to compel the minority to abide by its rulings. Should an expense of money be involved therein, the minority shall have to defray its part of the expenses. Should some members refuse to express their opinions under the aforesaid oath, such persons shall be ignored, while a majority vote by those who have taken the oath shall decide the above matters, for the dwellers of a town, the Tosephta decides (B. M. 11, 23), may force one another to provide for the public needs of their town.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A group of Jews of town T, without the knowledge or consent of the other Jewish inhabitants of T, formed a community organization and elected a single governing body with the power of apportioning taxes and managing all other communal and religious affairs. This organization assumed the authority to exercise these powers on all the inhabitants of T. Rabbi Meir Kohen, however, protested denying their authority, and refused to pay the taxes levied on him. He was willing to become a member of the community and share in the carrying of the community burden, provided he be permitted such rights in the election of leaders as were held by the other members of the community, or that the taxes be levied equitably, i.e., in exact proportion to a person&#x2019;s wealth. The elected leaders refused to accede to R. Meir&#x2019;s wishes and, with the help of Gentiles, forced their way into R. Meir&#x2019;s house and seized some of his valuables as pledges for the unpaid taxes. R. Meir retaliated by hiring other Gentiles who took back his valuables by force.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The Jews of T who have banded together in electing leaders and giving them authority to manage all communal affairs, had no right to do so even though they represented a majority of the Jewish inhabitants of T, as long as a minority took no part in the reorganization, for no new custom or institution can be established in a community without the knowledge and consent of all its inhabitants. The talmudic statement: &#x201C;The inhabitants of a city are permitted to enforce their rulings&#x201D; (B.B. 8b), means: a) If the people of a city unanimously agree to enact a certain ruling, they are permitted to punish and fine anyone who subsequently disregards that ruling; or, b) the seven leaders of a community, originally elected with the knowledge and consent of all the members of the community to manage community affairs and to punish offenders, have the right to enforce their rulings and decrees. But, no majority of city dwellers can force a minority to be governed by a ruling to the original passing of which they have not consented, or to accept the authority of leaders whom they have not consented to elect.</p>
<p>Moreover, any ordinance passed by the inhabitants of a city without the knowledge or consent of a great man (a scholar) residing in their midst, is void and is not binding even upon those who passed the ordinance (B.B. 9a). There can be no doubt, therefore, that no community can pass an ordinance to be binding upon the scholar himself, unless he agrees to its enactment. Thus, an organization established against the express wishes of R. Meir Kohen, a person of high standing and scholarship, has no right to force its authority on all the inhabitants of T. Therefore, R. Meir had the right to resort to the help of Gentiles in order to recover his valuables.</p>

Some members of the community seek to pronounce a <italic>herem</italic>, a community ban, for a certain purpose; while other members of the community openly protest against it. Are the former permitted to pronounce the ban, and when pronounced will the ban be binding on the latter group?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the purpose for which the pronouncement of the ban is sought, is designed for the public benefit or to fill a great need in the community, while without the innovation the existence of the community would be jeopardized, the members of the community are permitted to coerce one another to adopt the required resolution and to abide by it once it is adopted. A <italic>herem</italic>, however, cannot be effectively invoked upon those who protest against its being pronounced, since a <italic>herem</italic> [being in the nature of an oath or a vow] must first be accepted voluntarily by a person before it becomes binding on him.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. The community of T passed a certain ordinance and stipulated that whenever there would be sufficient indication that any member of the community violated the ordinance, he should be punished. It subsequently became known by circumstantial evidence that A violated the ordinance, although no one actually saw him do so. Moreover, when A was questioned about it, he equivocated and contradicted his own statements. The community leaders became convinced, therefore, that A had violated the ordinance.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The wording of the ordinance requires that whenever the judges become convinced that a person violated the ordinance, even though actual proof is lacking, he should be deserving of punishment. Since there is sufficient reason to believe that A violated the ordinance and since the members of the community know that he did so, the court has a right to punish him.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A gave a sum of money to a community to be used as an endowment fund for the maintenance of a Rabbi to be chosen by the community. After A&#x2019;s death, the people of the community chose their relative, B, as their Rabbi. A&#x2019;s daughter was married to a Rabbi who was the equal in scholarship to Rabbi B. Is the community obligated to accept as their Rabbi A&#x2019;s son-in-law in preference to Rabbi B? Moreover should some of A&#x2019;s children become poor, must the income from the endowment fund be used for their support rather than for the maintenance of the Rabbi, since it is to be assumed, in accordance with the principle of R. Simon b. Menassia (B.B. 132a) that A, while giving the money, intended that his own relatives be preferred to a stranger?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. After the money was given over to the community, neither A nor his family had greater rights to it than any other member of the community. The community, therefore, is not obligated to appoint A&#x2019;s son-in-law as their Rabbi. Moreover, it is to be presumed that A made a nobly charitable gift to the community without attaching any reservations or conditions. The law of R. Simon (B.B. 132a) deals with a charitable gift made under an erroneous assumption, while in our case no such condition existed.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. A did wrong in procuring his election as cantor &#x2014; a deputy of the community before the Almighty &#x2014; with the help of the Duke. In our country a matter like that would be very sternly dealt with. A similar case happened in Cologne in the time of R. Eliezer b. Joel. A Jew wanting to honor a newly elected cantor, arranged that the bishop should invite the cantor to his house. Then the bishop removed his miter and gave it to the Rabbi [cantor] and said: &#x201C;I give you herewith the office of cantor.&#x201D; The cantor became very much incensed and said to the bishop: &#x201C;Sir, our law does not permit me to receive the right to serve our Lord from your hands.&#x201D; The cantor resigned his post and I believe that he fined the Jew who was responsible for the bishop&#x2019;s act.

<p>R. Jacob, the cantor of Magdeburg, died and left a son, Hizkiyahu, who was worthy to succeed his father as cantor of Magdeburg, though inferior to him in some qualities. A majority of the membership of the Magdeburg community wanted the son to succeed his father, but a minority of possibly one or more strongly objected to the son. R. Moses b. Hisdai was asked for his opinion in the matter. He advised Hizkiyahu to try any measure in his power to ingratiate himself with the objectors. He asked the leaders of the community to direct their efforts toward effecting a reconciliation with the opposing faction, and expressed his opinion that a single person could not defy the will of the entire community. R. Isaac b. Moses (of Vienna) stated that according to Biblical Law a community could not hire a cantor to whom there was objection even by a single person. R. Meir stated his opinion that a cantor might officiate throughout the year even though not acceptable to a few congregants, but that he was not permitted to officiate on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> or on fast days, if even a single congregant found him objectionable.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A has no legal claim against B though he does have a claim against the community. Not having been asked regarding A&#x2019;s case against the community, I shall refrain from passing judgment thereon. Should the discussion that follows reveal any just claims A may have against the community, I rely on you not to disclose them to A, lest the community accuse me of encouraging claimants and inciting them against the community thus damaging its interests. It seems, however, that if A could have obtained another position, had he not been engaged by the community of T, and now can no longer obtain that, or a similar, position, the community ought to pay A the wages of an &#x201C;idle laborer&#x201D; (i. e. the wages a cantor would be willing to accept for abstaining from practicing his profession for a given period). But, if A is able to obtain another position even now, he has no legal claim against the community, though he has cause for reproof. Should the latter position require more effort than the position with the community of T, if there be also an increase in remuneration commensurate with the increase in effort, the community of T would be free from obligation to A; otherwise, the community of T would have to compensate A for the increase in effort. In any event, A has no legal claim against B, though he has cause for reproof, and the latter may perhaps be called &#x201C;wicked&#x201D;.</p>

The inhabitants of the alley, through their representative, deny that the community has any rights there, and introduce as evidence a bill of sale, countersigned by the leaders of the community, which reads: &#x201C;A (a former resident there) sold to B his house and his part of the alley which borders on the community wedding-hall.&#x201D; Thus the leaders of the community admitted, by countersigning the bill of sale, that the alley belongs to the people who live in the houses around it, and that even though the wedding-hall borders on it, the community possesses no rights in the alley.<xref rid="fn6">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p><italic>A</italic>.

On the other hand, the evidence produced by the inhabitants of the alley is worthless; for leaders of a community sign a bill of sale as judges and not as witnesses; and according to the Talmud (Ket. 109a), judges sign a document without reading it and, therefore, are not responsible for its contents.</p>

You have the power to stop this evil practice, but you do nothing about it. You know that such practice is prohibited by the Torah as evidenced by the talmudic decision (B. B. 21b) that an inhabitant of one city may restrain inhabitants of other cities from competing with him within his city limits, and other similar decisions (ibid. 22a, 21b). Furthermore, were we unable to prove that the Talmud forbids the practice mentioned above, we should have adduced such prohibition by simple logic, as we positively cannot imagine that it be permitted; for otherwise life would be unbearable. The rich would do business outside their own community, in all the settlements, and would thus increase the volume of business there without helping the Jews of those settlements to carry the burden of increased taxation directly resulting from such increase in business. You, the community of Nuremberg, must correct this injustice and must save the distressed from their oppressors.

<p><italic>A</italic>. The Jews of the entire kingdom became partners in the collective payment of their taxes for the reason that they were all the king&#x2019;s subjects and under obligation to pay their taxes to him. But, as soon as the Jews of the ceded territory ceased to be under the obligation of paying taxes to the king, the condition for the forming of the partnership no longer existed for them, and they could withdraw from the partnership (without the consent of the Jews of the rest of the kingdom). Therefore, if the king has given the entire income of the territory to his son, the Jews of that territory are under no obligation to their former associates. If, however, the king gave the territory itself to his son, but reserved the income to himself for a certain period of time, those Jews should continue to pay the taxes together with the Jews of the rest of the kingdom for that period of time.</p>

Now A, a resident of T, charges that the community, by its rash acts, caused him a loss of money. He demands that the community make good this loss.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The community was not at fault. The king had no right to make unjust demands upon it, for his deputy was in the wrong, not the community. The king, most certainly, had no right to punish the Jews of T for the sin of a single Jew who struck the Gentile. The acts of the community leaders, and the misdemeanor of the Jew were mere excuses for the extortion but not the cause thereof.

If A had originally separated himself from the community with the latter&#x2019;s full knowledge and consent, he need not cooperate with the community in the payment of its taxes; but, if he did not obtain the consent of the community, he had no right to make a separate agreement with the overlord since the custom of the community provides that all Jews be partners in the payment of the taxes. A community has a right to force a rebellious minority in its midst, to obey its customs. Furthermore, the overlord had no right to make a separate agreement with A in violation of the custom he himself had established among the Jews of his town. Such an act on the part of the overlord is not considered &#x201C;law of the land&#x201D;, but rather constitutes downright robbery. Although according to the Talmud a king may change the customary taxation arrangements of his subjects (B. B. 143a), he is permitted to do so only when he is acting of his own accord, but not when he is urged to do so by some of his subjects. A&#x2019;s objection that it will be prohibitive for him to pay taxes both to the overlord and to the community, is not very serious, for he may explain to the overlord that separating oneself from the community in the payment of taxes is prohibited by our laws, that on this account one becomes involved in quarrels with the Jews of the kingdom, and that henceforth he will refuse to pay his taxes independently of the community. In such matters we are permitted to act with severity even when not directly empowered by the Talmud, as long as we conform to the spirit of the Talmud; for, were a Jew permitted to separate himself from his community, great calamities would often ensue.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. a) A decided to remove from his province and from the jurisdiction of his overlord, and to settle in a town where B and his friends lived. Before taking up his residence under the new overlord he came to an agreement with him regarding the amount of taxes he was to pay, and further arranged to pay such taxes to him directly. A, therefore, refused to participate with the other members of the community whenever they jointly paid their taxes to the overlord. Hence they with B invoked against A the ban proclaimed by the communities against any one who refused to pay his taxes jointly with his community. Did A have the right to pay his taxes independently of the community?</p>
<p>b) For many years C resided in a locality where he paid his taxes jointly with D and the other Jews of the surrounding territory. He finally decided to sever his connections with them and made a separate agreement with the overlord to pay him a certain sum as a yearly tax. D and the other taxpayers strongly objected to this and therefore C came to an agreement with D and some of his friends. Others, however, still continued to raise objections to the course undertaken by C. Furthermore, whenever the ban (for nonpayment of taxes) was pronounced, it was couched in general terms which did not exclude C from it. Was C justified in his act?</p>
<p>c) Our overlord granted a release from taxation for the first year, to all Jews coming to settle in his territory. This release was granted against the wishes of the Jews already settled there. The new settlers paid no taxes during their first year of settlement in accordance with the above-mentioned release. But when payment of the taxes for the second year fell due, the old settlers, refusing to recognize the release granted by the overlord, forced the new settlers to pay taxes for both the current and the preceding years. Subsequently the overlord died and was succeeded by his son. The new and old settlers paid their taxes regularly without a complaint for many years. This year, however, quarrelsome persons came to settle here and they refused to pay their taxes for the first year because of the release granted by the father of the present overlord. Were they justified in their refusal?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A person settling in a town has no right to isolate himself from the rest of the community and pay his taxes independently. All (Jewish) dwellers in a town are partners in the expenses of maintaining the townwall, the horse guard, the armory and the city gates (B. B. 8a), and must share in paying the town safety tax, in maintaining the free kitchen and the charity chest, and in contributing to similar town expenses, such as a tax to the overlord who is responsible for the safety of the town. Since every town dweller is a partner in these expenses, no partner is permitted (according to talmudic law) to withdraw from a partnership without the consent of the other partners. Moreover, were paying of taxes independently of the community not forbidden by talmudic law, such practice would be proscribed by custom; for throughout the kingdom the custom of considering all taxpayers of a community as partners, and of not allowing anyone to pay his taxes independently, is well established. If not for this rule, equitable distribution of the burden of taxation would be impossible and endless quarrels would ensue, endangering the position of the Jew among his neighbors. Therefore, the community has a right to restrain A (and C) from paying taxes independently, even if only a single member of the community objects to such independent payment of taxes. The community has a right to use persuasion or force upon A and C, by flagellation, ban, or edict of excommunication. You have my full consent to resort to these coercive measures. The same rule applies to the quarrelsome new settlers (referred to in the third query). They must pay their full share of the taxes, even for the first year of their settlement.</p>
<p>These queries were sent to R. Meir by the Jews of Stendal. The following statements are appended.</p>
<p>I subscribe to the opinion of my teacher and relative, R. Meir, that they can not separate themselves from the community without its permission; for the goods of one town dweller may be mortgaged for the unpaid taxes of another town dweller (B. K. 113b).

<p>We also agree with our great teachers to ban and anathematize all those who come to settle in a territory where Jews live unless they share the burden of taxes paid to the king and overlords. Signed: The community of Erfurt.</p>
<p>Whatever the new settler agreed to pay to the overlord and whatever the community agreed to pay, must be lumped together, and each member of the community must pay his share of this sum in proportion to his wealth and means. Signed: David b. Abraham; Baruch b. Yehiel.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. If there is an established custom in the community, of which A is a member, that every member pays his taxes directly to the authorities and distributes his charity as he sees fit, the community can not force A to abandon this practice unless A agrees to the change. But if the custom was that all the members were to pay their taxes and distribute their charities collectively, A must abide by this custom. Where the community is new and no custom exists, talmudic law prevails which provides that the majority may force the minority to pay their taxes collectively and to establish a community charity fund to which every member must contribute.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A, a wealthy person, pays his taxes directly to the lord and not together with the community. He lent money to his friends B and C, who invested it for profit. The volume of business in that locality with Jewish money, however, was not enlarged through B&#x2019;s and C&#x2019;s transactions with A&#x2019;s money, since A would have invested the money himself had he not lent it to B and C. The lord, therefore, will not make any greater demands for taxes because of C&#x2019;s and B&#x2019;s investments. Must B and C pay taxes to the community for the money they borrowed from A?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The community can rightly claim that had A not lent the money to B and C he would not have invested that money but would have kept it in reserve. Therefore, the transactions by B and C with A&#x2019;s money do increase the volume of Jewish business and the overlord may demand more taxes because of this increase. Moreover, it is a custom in our kingdom that those who borrow money from wealthy individuals who pay their taxes independently of the community, must pay taxes to the community from the borrowed money.</p>

<h1><bold>555</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. The community of T, with the consent of (R. Meir&#x2019;s relative) Kohen Zedek, decreed: a) that anyone who moves out of T may not return to it in order to lend additional funds to his debtors, for the purpose of fortifying his investments with them, without the knowledge and consent of the community, the latter having to determine whether or not such debts can be collected without lending additional funds to the debtors; b) that if the debts can be so collected, the non-resident creditor be not permitted to lend additional funds to the his debtors; c) that in case a member of the community will be willing to take over the investments of such creditor, the latter be forced to transfer such investments to the former; and d) that if anyone is found transgressing this decree and lending additional funds to his debtors without the knowledge and consent of the community, he should pay on all of his money that can be found a tax of six Cologne pennies per <italic>mark</italic>. A was discovered to have transgressed this decree.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A was a resident of T when the aforesaid ordinance was passed, whether he supported the measure, accepted it tacitly, or openly protested against it, he is bound by it even though he subsequently moved out of T. For a person&#x2019;s protests against an ordinance designed for the public benefit and passed by a majority vote of the worthy members of the community are of no avail. Thus the ordinance of Rabbenu Gershom reads as follows: &#x201C;If the residents of a city have established an ordinance for the benefit of the community, for the benefit of the poor, or for any other useful purpose, and most of the worthy ones have agreed to it, the others may not void such ordinance and may not demand to take the matter to court, for no court may sit in such a case, because everything depends on the opinion of the prominent men of the city, in accordance with the custom of the ancients, or as an emergency measure.&#x201D;</p>
<p>If A, however, moved out of T before the ordinance was passed, he is to be governed only by talmudic law and by customs generally accepted by the communities, while any restrictive measure adopted by the community of T after A moved out is not binding on him. A community may force a dissenting minority and all those who subsequently come to settle in the town, to accept its decrees and ordinances. But a community possesses no authority over a person who moved out of town before the decrees and ordinances were passed, and who does not live there any longer. Therefore, if A had had ample opportunity, since he left T, to force his debtors to replay their debts to him, and failed to do so, he must pay the community taxes on such debts. But if he was unable to collect these debts, the custom is well established in all communities not to tax such debts. Any local ordinance in opposition to such custom is not binding on a non-resident who was a non-resident at the time the ordinance was passed. But, if the community representatives claim that A has had ample opportunity to force collection of his debts, and A denies such claim, the latter must take an oath to bolster his denial.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Before A settled in T, the community borrowed money on interest in order to pay a tax that had been levied on it. A died before this debt fell due. Before his death, however, A paid other taxes to the community on the twelve hundred [<italic>marks?</italic>] he did business with, of which some was his own money and some belonged to others. A&#x2019;s estate fell to several heirs some of whom lived outside of T. An ordinance of the community of T required that anyone who moved from T had to pay his share of all the debts the community had contracted for the purpose of paying its taxes, even though such debts did not yet fall due at the time the person moved from T. Does this ordinance obligate A&#x2019;s heirs, who live outside of T, to pay their share of the above mentioned debt before they remove the funds from T which they inherited from A?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The ordinance applies only to residents of T who seek to leave town, but not to outsiders who inherit money from residents. Since the ordinance does not explicitly include such inheriting outsiders, we cannot include them by any logical inference. Since A&#x2019;s heirs who live outside of T are not required by talmudic law to pay any share of the above mentioned debt [as it was contracted in order to pay a tax which was levied before A came to live in T], they cannot be required to pay anything because of the ordinance. They must pay, however, on the money they inherited from A, their proportionate share of all the taxes the community of T has paid during A&#x2019;s residence in T. A himself became obligated to pay such taxes on the twelve hundred [<italic>marks</italic>?] he did business with, even though part of this money did not belong to him; and his heirs must pay this obligation of A in full. The claim of the heirs, therefore, that the debts of the estate should be paid first, and that only the remainder of the estate should be assessed for the above-mentioned taxes, must be denied. On the other hand, although the ordinance mentioned above does not apply to A&#x2019;s heirs who live outside of T, those ordinances of the community of T which grant to heirs special exemptions from taxes, do apply even to the heirs who live out of T.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Leah claims that she settled in the town T subsequent to the demand of a tax from the Jews by the burghers of the town, and after they had instructed the Jews to pay the tax to a Jew, A; that she was, therefore, not subject to this tax, even though A gave the community an extension of the time for payment; and that the community had no right to collect any money from her in payment therefor. The community claims that Leah sent her money to T for investment before the burghers demanded the tax; that her sister rented a house for her, which indicates that Leah had decided to reside in T before she actually came there; that it is a custom of the community to collect taxes from all those resident at the time of collection even though they were not residents at the time the tax was demanded; and that the tax was paid in order to save their lives, since the burghers threatened &#x201C;to do what they did on the Rhine.&#x201D; Leah denied the claims that she sent her money to T, that it had been invested before her arrival and that her sister had rented a house for her. She stated that the Jews always paid a tax to the burghers whenever the latter demanded it; and that she did not intend to settle in T at all, but that being her sister&#x2019;s surety she had to follow her sister when the latter fled from her former settlement.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Matters of taxation depend on local custom. It is needless to ask me the custom of our community, for you may have a different custom. Anyone who settles in a new place is bound by the custom prevailing there. But since the community has completely settled its obligations to the burghers, by consenting to pay the tax to A, before Leah settled in T, the representatives of the community must prove through witnesses who are not residents of T, that according to their custom Leah was obliged to pay the amount the community demanded, before they could deprive her of any of her property. If Leah, however, rented a house in T before the tax was levied, she is bound to pay her share of the tax, despite the fact that the community may not be able to prove any prevailing custom to that effect.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. B informed the community of T that he wished to move out of town. He did move out of town, but settled within one mile of T. He continued to lend money to the nobles, his customers, asserting that he was unable to collect his debts from them unless he lent them additional funds. Subsequently, a heavy tax was imposed on the community by the overlord of T. The community protested to the overlord that B, the man who formerly used to defray half of the taxes imposed on the community, had moved out of town [outside of the overlord&#x2019;s jurisdiction], but their protests were of no avail. The community, therefore, demands that B pay his share of the tax.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If it is true that B left town before the overlord demanded the tax, he is under no obligation to pay it, since he lived outside of the city limits, even though within one mile of T. I have known many instances where men who have left their town and moved to places scarcely half a mile away, no longer paid their taxes to the community. Formerly, when the country had a king, the Jews of the surrounding territory &#x2014; even those who lived eight miles away from town, in fact those who lived in the entire bishopric &#x2014; would pay their taxes to the king collectively with the community. [But this is no longer done.] However, if, while B was still living in T, the community passed a ruling [regarding the payment of taxes, or the lending of additional funds to debtors, by the Jews who move to the surrounding territory], he is still bound by such a ruling. The community, on the other hand, did an improper thing by informing the overlord that B used to bear half the burden of the community taxes. They should merely have informed the overlord that B had moved out of town, and should have been satisfied with whatever reduction the overlord would have granted to them on this account. Regarding B&#x2019;s business transactions, however, if B could not have collected his debts from the nobles unless he lent them additional funds, he is under no obligation to pay taxes on such investments.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. If A could not have collected his debts unless he had lent additional funds to his debtors, he had a right to lend them such funds, and these transactions should have been tax-free. The members of the community, as interested parties, are not qualified to serve as witnesses in this matter. Therefore, either every member of the community must take an oath to support the claim of its representatives, or the community must permit A to take an oath in support of his contention. However, if the community can produce even a single, independent, witness &#x2014; one who has no financial interest in this trial, or one from whom the community shall agree to take a certain specified amount as his share of the tax regardless of the outcome of this trial &#x2014; in support of the claims of the representatives, or to the effect that A freed the community from the obligation of taking an oath, no oath will be required.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A promised under oath to move out of T before the first of <italic>Iyyar</italic> or pay one <italic>mark</italic> to charity. The inhabitants of T claimed that A did not faithfully fulfill his promise, and they gave the following reasons: a) A did not move out of T since he had settled within the Sabbath limits (2000 cubits) of the town; b) he did not pay any taxes to the Cologne community, probably because he contended that he was still an inhabitant of T; c) he occasionally returned to T to collect his debts. Thus, A never intended to keep his promise; he was only trying to evade his oath; he, therefore, was obligated to pay one <italic>mark</italic> to charity. A, on the other hand, claimed that he had moved outside of the Sabbath limits of T into the jurisdiction of another overlord; that he had asked the tax collectors of Cologne to free him from the tax, because he had as yet not decided where to settle; that R. Jacob had told him that he, A, had fulfilled his promise properly; and that R. Jacob had, therefore, freed him from his obligation.</p>
<p>A. Even though A settled only within two thousand cubits of T, he had really moved out of T proper and had thus fulfilled his promise; for the outskirts of a town are not part of the town (as far as oaths or vows are concerned, cf. Ned. 56b). Moreover, it was just A&#x2019;s good fortune that he did not have to pay taxes to the Cologne community, because he was regarded as an inhabitant of T. We are in no position to determine whether or not A intended to keep his promise; and we have no right to fine A because of our suspicions or because we question his true intentions. However, in order to allay all suspicion, I advised A to make a statement, accompanied by a solemn hand-clasp, to the effect that he intended to fulfill his promise faithfully.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. When community leaders claim that a member of their community owes a certain amount of taxes to the community and the member denies owing anything and refuses to pay, the leaders usually break into his house, often with the help of Gentiles, and forcefully take away valuables as pledges to secure the payment of the taxes demanded. Where do the community leaders get that right?</p>
<p>A. Taxes levied by the secular government are considered to be in the possession of the government even before actual collection of same. The community [the collecting agency of the government&#x2019;s taxes] possesses the same rights as the government and is, therefore, allowed to impound a person&#x2019;s valuables in order to have actual possession of the tax money. Moreover, this procedure is followed by all communities and is an accepted custom, having the strength of a law.</p>

<p>The custom is well established throughout the kingdom that when an individual has a complaint against the community regarding the tax he was assessed with, he must first pay that tax and, then, may summon the community to court, for the community prefers to be in possession of such tax-money. As corroborative evidence of the legality of this procedure I cite the talmudic ruling that those who pay the capitation tax for others are justified in forcing the latter in their service (B. M. 73b), since &#x201C;the law of the land prevails&#x201D;. Moreover, since the members of the community are partners in the payment of the taxes, no individual may willfully withdraw from the partnership. Since the majority (of the members of a community) may force the minority to abide by its rulings (B. B. 8b), it may certainly force an individual to pay his taxes. The burden of proof to the contrary rests upon the person who seeks to deviate from this rule.</p>
<p>Since the overlord customarily collects his taxes collectively from the entire community, the exact obligation of each member of the community regarding such tax becomes determined as if already collected (the very moment the overlord demands the collective tax); and if the overlord subsequently desires to free or relieve one member at the expense of the others, he has no right to do so. Such an act on his part is not considered &#x201C;law of the land,&#x201D; but rather constitutes outright robbery, and is, therefore, not valid.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A claims that his assets, equal to forty <italic>marks</italic>, for which the community demands a tax, are not taxable.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The decisions on questions of taxation are dependent more on custom than on talmudic law. The following rule is generally accepted by the communities: In any tax dispute between an individual and the community, the latter first collects the tax and then goes to court. Therefore, even before the tax is collected, the community is considered to be in possession of the tax-money, and the burden of proof falls upon the individual. This is not only an accepted custom, but also good talmudic law, and is operative even in a new community where there are no established customs. But if the community in question has a different custom, that custom prevails, though it be at variance with talmudic law.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. C gave a pledge to the community treasurers, the collectors of the tax, as security for his share of that tax. The treasurers, however, later lost that pledge (apparently through no fault of theirs). Must C pay his share of the tax?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since the overlord keeps the community responsible for the deficiency caused by the loss of C&#x2019;s pledge, the community is collectively held responsible for the entire tax (each individual, therefore, is responsible to the community and not to the overlord). Since C gave the pledge to the representative of the community, and it was lost while in the latter&#x2019;s possession, C is free from obligation. Therefore, the whole community must make up the deficiency. We can not compare this case to that of the man who betrothed a woman with a pledge (Kidd. 8b), and conclude that since the pledge was given as security only and did not constitute actual payment, that C did not as yet discharge his obligation; for the community is not obliged to pay the overlord actual cash, but may pay its tax in valuables as well as in cash. Thus the custom is that when a person gives a pledge to the community treasurer (and then fails to redeem it) the pledge is not sold but is handed over intact to the overlord&#x2019;s messenger, when the latter comes to demand the tax-money, in payment of that person&#x2019;s share of the tax, whether the pledge be worth much more than, or exactly as much as, that share of the tax. Therefore, whether a person pays cash or gives a pledge, makes no difference to the community. The second case you ask about, is exactly similar to the first. As soon as a person hands over his payment to the treasurer of the community, he is free from obligation. However, such payment must actually be made to the treasurer; mere setting aside of valuables as payment for taxes, is not sufficient.</p>

Subsequently some members of the community summoned B to court regarding the tax on the debt, and the court reached a certain decision.

Even if A was out of town at the time, if B has complied with the court&#x2019;s decision in the matter, he is under no obligation to A. B is not required to take an oath denying A&#x2019;s claim, since no oath is imposed for the purpose of forcing compliance with an alleged former oath. On the other hand, A&#x2019;s statement to B did not, in itself, absolve B from obligation to A, since a person, sometimes, does not reveal his real arguments and claims to his opponent until they both appear at court.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. The overlord incarcerated the Jews of his province for purposes of extortion. Among them was A, who did not possess sufficient funds to cover his ransom. He gave as part of his ransom, therefore, ten <italic>marks</italic> which B had lent him for investment purposes, the profits of which were to be shared equally by A and B. Must A return the ten <italic>marks</italic> to B?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. You failed to explain the custom of your community governing the payment of taxes from profit-sharing investments. I have learned from your countryman, however, that taxes on such investments are paid in your town by both partners, the silent partner paying one half and the active partner paying the other half. The same procedure is followed by our community. Therefore, A can not be released from repaying half of the loan since his responsibility in regard to that half was that of a debtor responsible for losses caused through unavoidable accidents. He is under no obligation, however, to repay the entire other half of the above investment, since B has had to pay half of the taxes on the investment. B may not successfully claim that the money paid to the overlord was not a tax but a ransom, and that he is under no obligation to pay for A&#x2019;s ransom, for, in these days, we have no regular taxes. Whatever the overlord demands, must be paid. Those who refuse to pay, are imprisoned, shorn of their possessions, and even murdered. Yet, B had undertaken to pay half of such taxes. Although, in our case, the overlord had incarcerated his Jews, we know that he merely wanted to collect from them an extraordinarily heavy tax and was afraid that they might flee his domain to escape payment. Were he certain that they would not have fled, he would not have incarcerated them and would have collected the same amount in a normal manner. Therefore, the money paid to the overlord was paid as a tax, and not as a ransom; especially so, since A alone was not arrested but together with the rest of the community, and no false charges were brought against him. The overlord had intended that each Jew pay the tax according to the amount of money he used in business; therefore, all investments became liable to such tax. Moreover, B must pay his share of the tax, or his transaction with A would be a usurious one, for A would not have been arrested, had he not dealt with B&#x2019;s money. Had there been an understanding between A and B that the latter would not have to pay A&#x2019;s ransom money (should A be incarcerated for purposes of extortion), such understanding would imply that B expected to share in the profits but not in the losses; and this would constitute a usurious transaction.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A and B were incarcerated by the overlord for purposes of extortion. They made a joint settlement with the overlord. A&#x2019;s wife possesses money of her own, which she obtained through selling her jewelry; and A has never used that money. Since A and B must contribute toward their ransom in proportion to their wealth, is the money of A&#x2019;s wife to be considered part of A&#x2019;s wealth?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The overlord had intended that A and B pay their ransom out of the money held by them and their wives, for an overlord&#x2019;s greed is directed toward all the money in active circulation. Moreover, the custom of our kingdom requires that a person pay taxes even out of the money belonging to his unmarried sons and daughters. Therefore, the money of A&#x2019;s wife became subject to the tax.</p>

A was arrested by his lord who seized his property, including the pledge. He finally agreed to pay his lord a certain sum, in consideration of which he was set free and the pledge was returned to him. He demands that B pay him part of the redemption price.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A claims that when the overlord seized his valuables he also seized L(eah)&#x2019;s valuables which were in the same room; and that when he finally settled with the overlord to pay him a fixed sum of money, and the latter returned all of the valuables to him, he pledged them with the persons who went surety for him to the overlord. L demands her valuables, and A demands that L pay part of the tax he promised to pay to the overlord.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A&#x2019;s claim regarding the seizure of L&#x2019;s valuables is true, it is presumed that L abandoned all hope of recovering them. Although in the case of an ordinary robber no such presumption exists (B. K. 114a), at present every overlord is king in his domain; no one exercises any restraint upon him, and we presume that owners of movables seized by an overlord have abandoned all hope of recovery. Therefore, L&#x2019;s seized valuables belong to A since he acquired them through abandonment (<italic>yeush</italic>) and change of possession (<italic>shinui reshut</italic>), although the principle &#x201C;the law of the land prevails&#x201D; does not apply in this case of robbery and extortion. However, A is not entitled to collect any additional tax-money from L, since she was not personally included by the overlord in his extortionist act on A. Although all persons earning money in a town or locality must share the burden of taxation of such a town or locality, this ruling applies only to regular taxes of a fixed amount annually collected by the king (or overlord) from the entire community in one lump sum. The robbery and extortion of an overlord, however, on pretext or false accusation, is to be borne only by the person unfortunately caught in his toils, but not by those who, probably by the grace of God, have escaped them.</p>

<h1><bold>571</bold></h1>
<p>1) <italic>Q</italic>. Two brothers, A and B, owned a house and other valuables and investments in partnership. They always paid their taxes and levies out of the profit from their investments before they divided the balance among themselves. A died and left a widow and a daughter. Subsequently B was arrested together with other Jews from his town for purposes of extortion, and was forced to pay a heavy ransom. B, therefore, sought to pay his ransom from the money of the partnership; the widow and her daughter objected to this insisting that since they were not arrested, they should be under no obligation to pay part of B&#x2019;s ransom.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Although A and B have paid their taxes from the money of the partnership, since there had been no formal agreement between them on this matter, each was entitled to dissolve the partnership at any time without giving previous notice to the other. Since A died and his estate went to his heirs, the latter are under no obligation to pay B&#x2019;s ransom. Since not all the Jews of the town were arrested, and those who were not arrested did not pay any part of the extortionate levy, the widow and her daughter did not become personally obligated to pay any part of this levy. Nor can they be made to pay part of the levy because of A&#x2019;s partnership with B. The widow is entitled to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> from the money already collected from the debtors of A and B.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. Since A&#x2019;s widow did not receive payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic> immediately upon demand, but her case was unduly delayed, was she entitled to her sustenance during this period of protraction and delay?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. As soon as a widow demands her <italic>ketubah</italic>, she forfeits her right to have her sustenance provided from the estate, no matter how long a time the collection of the <italic>ketubah</italic> will take.</p>

<h1><bold>572</bold></h1>
<p>1) <italic>Q</italic>. A paid his taxes directly to the overlord of his town, independently of the rest of the community. The overlord, suspecting that A possessed much greater wealth than he usually professed to have, and being driven by a greed for money, arrested him without cause and later arrested his wife L. Before her arrest, however, and before the reason for these arrests became manifest, L helped Gershom, A&#x2019;s son by a previous marriage, to flee the domain of the overlord and thus escape from his clutches. Meanwhile, A was put to death in prison. The overlord posted guards in the town to make sure that A&#x2019;s children did not escape, and demanded a large sum of money from L. He further proposed that L merge her taxes with those of the community and that the latter jointly with L negotiate the new tax. When the community representatives asked as to the identity of the persons who would be expected to pay this tax, the overlord answered that everybody would pay it, the young and the old, the rich and the poor. The community representatives, then, strongly objected to the merger with L; whereupon the overlord agreed to negotiate with them separately. He levied a very heavy tax on the community, but this tax did not exceed the estimated value of the wealth of the community members. L was warned that should she prove to be stubborn and unyielding, she and A&#x2019;s children would be made to suffer the same fate as A. Finally the overlord came to terms with L and agreed to release her, and to return to her A&#x2019;s impounded valuables, for a ransom of six hundred and twenty pounds. To insure the payment of this ransom the overlord demanded as hostages one of L&#x2019;s children and one of A&#x2019;s children by his former marriage. Now Gershom, and A&#x2019;s other children by his former marriage, refuse to pay their part of the ransom money, and instead, wish to pay their part of the assessment on the community.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Gershom is not obliged to pay any part of the ransom money since he escaped before the overlord asked for such money. Although L engineered his escape, he is under no monetary obligation to her, since she merely did him a favor. However, if Gershom is to claim, as his share of the inheritance, part of A&#x2019;s valuables that have remained in town within the grasp of the overlord, he must pay a proportionate part of the ransom for such valuables. A&#x2019;s children by his former marriage must pay their part of the ransom money in proportion to their wealth. Even though they were not imprisoned, there is sufficient indication that the overlord intended to include them in the extortion. Thus, guards had been posted in town to watch them, and their lives had been explicitly threatened upon L&#x2019;s refusal to come to terms with the overlord. Moreover, had the overlord negotiated with L regarding only her personal possessions, he would not have demanded 620 pounds from her, knowing full well that she was entitled to receive from A&#x2019;s estate only her <italic>ketubah</italic>, and that such a sum was well beyond her means. The overlord did not demand from the community a sum greater than the value of all their wealth; therefore, it stands to reason that he was not entirely unreasonable in his demands upon L. We may assume with certainty that had L refused to pay the ransom, A&#x2019;s children would have been seized, and would have been killed or forcibly baptized. Had A&#x2019;s children protested against being ransomed, we would have paid no attention to them and would have effected their release even against their will, and then, we would have collected the ransom money from them; for we are obliged to ransom a Jew even against his will. Now, that A&#x2019;s children have not protested against the ransom, they must certainly contribute thereto in proportion to their wealth. Although their lives were threatened, and the talmudic law (B.B. 116b) would thus require that the amount of the ransom money should be calculated, one half equally for each person, and the other half in proportion to the individual&#x2019;s wealth, this law does not apply to our case. We know that the overlord was interested only in their money, not in taking their lives, as the whole trouble started because the overlord thought A to be very wealthy.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. L seized some of A&#x2019;s movables claiming that she seized them for the purpose of paying for her sustenance. Some of these movables were originally impounded by the overlord and were later returned to L. May A&#x2019;s heirs force L to render under oath an account of such valuables?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Movables impounded by an overlord are considered abandoned property (<italic>hefker</italic>), title thereto, passing to the first person who seizes them, since the original owner must have given up hope of retrieving them. Although owners do not usually abandon movables taken away by Gentile robbers (B.K. 114a), they do abandon these when impounded by the overlord of the town, since he is the undisputed master of the town and no one can restrain him. This was especially true in our case, since his claim was bolstered by false accusations. Therefore, L is under no obligation to give an account of the movables returned to her by the overlord. However, those movables which the overlord had returned to her, and which she gave to the overlord in partial payment of the ransom, should be credited <italic>pro rata</italic> to all those who are obliged to pay the ransom, since the valuables had been given to her in order to decrease the ransom for all parties involved. Furthermore, L is under no obligation to give an accounting of the other movables she seized (the movables that were not impounded by the overlord) as long as it is known that the value of such movables does not exceed the value of her <italic>ketubah</italic>. For whenever L demands her <italic>ketubah</italic>, she will have to take an oath regarding these movables; as long as she does not demand her <italic>ketubah</italic>, no oath can be imposed on her.</p>
<p>3) <italic>Q</italic>. Rabbi Kuzlan, a relative of R. Meir, declared that A had deposited money with him and had told him to give the money, after A&#x2019;s death, to R. Mushlin, A&#x2019;s brother, who had received instructions regarding its disposal. Rabbi Kuzlan, therefore, gave the money to R. Mushlin. The latter claims that he was instructed by A to give all the money to A&#x2019;s children by his former marriage. R. Liber Shamash, another relative of R. Meir, testified that A made the following declaration in his presence: &#x201C;Half of all the ready cash I have here, and in the house of Rabbi Kuzlan, and in the settlement, was given to Gershom my son, and the other half to his two older sisters, and I have empowered my brother Mushlin thus to dispose of the deposit that is in the house.&#x201D; L, on the other hand, produced a document wherein it was written that A had obligated himself not to alienate any of his property and thus put it beyond his wife&#x2019;s reach. L, therefore, demands that R. Mushlin take an oath to support his assertions.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The testimony of R. Liber Shamash is of no consequence since a verbal admission of having given valuables to a certain person, is no proof that title to such valuables was actually transferred to that person. Therefore, R. Mushlin has no witness to support his assertions. Although heirs may not exact an oath from a trustee appointed by their father (Gitt. 52a), this rule applies only to the heirs, who are to inherit the property managed by the trustee; but, the heirs who, according to the assertions of the trustee, are not to receive any part of such property, may exact an oath from the trustee even though they are not positive in their claim that the trustee had wronged them. Therefore, L and her children may exact the oath from R. Mushlin. Moreover, even if R. Mushlin&#x2019;s assertions were true, A&#x2019;s gift to his children by his former marriage would be considered a gift <italic>causa mortis</italic>, since it was to be given to them after A&#x2019;s death. Since a widow and orphaned daughters are entitled to draw their sustenance from all <italic>causa mortis</italic> gifts, L and her daughters would be entitled to draw their sustenance, and L would be entitled to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic>, from the money in the hands of R. Mushlin, if no unencumbered assets remain of A&#x2019;s estate. L&#x2019;s daughters are entitled to receive their sustenance till their marriage, the expense to be born proportionately by A&#x2019;s heirs (out of their inheritance). At the time of their marriage they will be entitled to a dowry of one tenth the immovables of A&#x2019;s estate. L&#x2019;s son, however, must derive his sustenance from his own portion of the inheritance, and when it will all be consumed he will have to resort to charity.</p>
<p>4) <italic>Q</italic>. L, at the time of her arrest, hired an agent to manage A&#x2019;s estate, to collect debts and sell valuables, in order to raise money for the ransom. She agreed to pay the agent a large sum of money for his efforts. Furthermore, R. Mushlin claims to have incurred expenses in his efforts to save L and A&#x2019;s children.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since L had a right to hire an agent (Gitt. 52a) and since she was in urgent need of help, the agent is entitled to receive adequate compensation for his efforts; the court is to determine what constitutes adequate compensation. The agent, however, is not entitled to receive anything above such amount, even though L had promised him much more, for wages and hire are subject to reassessment. If R. Mushlin&#x2019;s claim is disputed, he must take an oath to support it. L had no right to sell any part of A&#x2019;s estate unless such sale was made in the presence of a lay court. Therefore, the articles sold must be reevaluated by such a court. If the articles had been sold below such evaluation, the difference should be deducted from L&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic>; but if the articles were sold above the estimated value, the difference should revert to the heirs.</p>
<p>5) <italic>Q</italic>. Upon her marriage, A&#x2019;s daughter by a former marriage was given by R. Mushlin, as part of her dowry, her share (one quarter) of the money originally deposited with Rabbi Kuzlan (see part 3).</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. L was entitled to collect a proportionate part of her <italic>ketubah</italic> exclusively from this money; now that this money had been given to the husband of A&#x2019;s daughter, L may no longer collect that part of her <italic>ketubah</italic>. Therefore, R. Mushlin has directly damaged L&#x2019;s interests and must make good, out of his own pocket, the loss thus sustained by L.</p>
<p>6) <italic>Q</italic>. Are the heirs permitted to pay L her <italic>ketubah</italic> by transferring to her debts due from Gentiles, if she objects to such manner of payment?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Debts due from Gentiles can not be directly assigned to a third person. Even though there is an indirect method of assigning such debts, a woman may refuse such manner of payment since even a creditor or one who has suffered damage may refuse to receive payment in such manner. Moreover, a woman is not expected to suffer the hardships and indignities entailed in collecting debts from Gentiles. Therefore, L may insist on being paid only in nonencumbered valuables.</p>
<p>7) <italic>Q</italic>. During the perilous period of the persecution by the overlord, a Gentile who owed ten <italic>marks</italic> to A came to L and asked her to release him from this debt. L, fearing lest refusal would aggravate the situation, said to the Gentile: &#x201C;I shall never demand this money from you&#x201D;. A&#x2019;s heirs claim that this release caused them an unnecessary loss of ten <italic>marks</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Neither according to Jewish law nor according to the law of the land does L&#x2019;s statement release the debtor from his obligation to A&#x2019;s heirs. But, if according to the law of your particular town this debt is considered cancelled, L is to be held responsible for the amount the debt was worth at the time of the release. Surely the debt was not worth very much at a time when the creditor was in mortal danger&#x0021; However, if L released the aforementioned debtor, as a safety measure, and as a contributing factor to gain relief, the loss must be born by L, and the heirs that were in town at the time, <italic>pro rata</italic>.</p>
<p>8) <italic>Q</italic>. A had deposited one pound with a burgher. After L came to terms with the overlord, the burgher returned the pound. L and the heirs who were in town during the period of danger, claim that it would have been impossible to collect the pound from the burgher if the settlement had not been effected with the overlord, while the other heirs claim that the burgher would have returned the money in any event.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If L is not able to take an oath to the effect, that (she is certain that) the deposit would in all probability have been lost if not for the settlement with the overlord, no ransom money can be collected from this deposit.</p>
<p>9) <italic>Q</italic>. The youngest heir received for his share debts due to the estate. The market value of these debts was much less than their face value. Since every heir must contribute to the payment of L&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic> in proportion to the amount of money, he or she, inherited from A&#x2019;s estate, what amount is the youngest heir to contribute?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. He must contribute in proportion to the market value of the debts.</p>
<p>10) <italic>Q</italic>. Two notes of indebtedness were held in A&#x2019;s room which had been sealed up by the overlord (at the time of the extortion). Are the investments attested to by these notes, subject to the payment of the ransom money?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. These investments are in the same category as the money and the valuables that were held in the room; for had no agreement been reached with the overlord, he would have taken away the notes of indebtedness, and the investments would have been lost. Even when the notes are presented to (Gentile) debtors, they are often unwilling to repay their debts; when such notes are lost, one can not expect repayment. Moreover, the overlord would have collected these debts for himself.</p>
<p>11) <italic>Q</italic>. L took from Gershom&#x2019;s share debts to the value of one hundred and seventy pounds. Now that Gershom is not required to pay any ransom money, how can he collect his money?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Gershom may charge this amount to his sisters&#x2019; shares of the ransom money and collect it from them, or he may charge it to the payment of L&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic>. L does not have to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic>, or the ransom money, directly from the orphan girls; she may collect it from their money in the hands of R. Mushlin. The latter has no right to give the money he holds, to anyone until L receives all that is due her from the heirs, both male and female, each one according to his share.</p>
<p>If R. Mushlin has already given this money to the heirs, or should he in the future give it to them in order to put obstacles in L&#x2019;s way, and thus make it difficult for her to collect her money, then R. Mushlin is to be held responsible for such payments, and is to pay L out of his own pocket.</p>
<p>R. Meir adds: &#x201C;You have protracted your case and have burdened me beyond endurance. I cannot bear your sending me any further inquiries regarding this case. It is obvious that the trustees are only interested in causing annoyance, vexation and protraction. From now on judge any case that may come before you, yourselves&#x0021;&#x201D; R. Meir further adds: &#x201C;At last it has become apparent, it is sad to reflect, that all these cunning machinations are employed only to harass the widow, to procrastinate, and to deprive her of her <italic>ketubah</italic>; but you are merely succeeding in troubling and harassing me to no purpose.&#x201D;</p>

Moreover, had A acted on his own initiative and ransomed B without being requested to do so, he would still have been entitled to reimbursement, for a Jew should be ransomed even against his express will, and may be charged with the expenses thus incurred. The promise of the rich man to speak to the bishop was of no consequence, since he did not offer to spend money on B&#x2019;s behalf. We know that mere words are of no avail.

The officer threatened B with both bodily injury and confiscation of his property should he discover that B lied to him. Moreover, the officer forced B to take an oath as to the truth of his assertions; and because of this oath B was forced to admit that he owed money to A, and finally had to pay fifteen pounds to the officer. B, therefore, demands that A compensate him for the loss he suffered because of A.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If originally B borrowed the one pound from A, his responsibility thereto was that of a borrower, and he must now repay this amount to A. If A, however, had originally deposited this pound with B for safekeeping, and B kept this money intact and did not use it, he is now under no obligation to A since the officer specifically demanded that money from B. If B can produce no witnesses to testify to the fact that he was forced to deliver A&#x2019;s money to the officer, he must take an oath to that effect. In any event, B has no claim against A.</p>

Are <italic>Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur</italic>, and <italic>Succoth</italic>, considered to be in the same category as <italic>Pesach, Shabuoth</italic>, and <italic>Succoth</italic>, the intervening of which holidays permits a person to remarry?

<p><italic>A</italic>. The intervening of <italic>Pesach, Shabuoth</italic>, and <italic>Succoth</italic>, only, permits a person to remarry.

Therefore, even if the overlord releases A (on condition that he marry the woman) he will not be permitted to remarry till after the third holiday.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A and B were captured and held for ransom. The former was rich and the latter, poor. A spent money with the help of his mother and effected the release of both A and B. A claims that B asked to be ransomed, and therefore demands that B pay his share of the expenses. B denies having asked to be ransomed.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A Jew should be ransomed even against his express will, and be charged with the expenses incurred. A captive in the hands of Gentiles is exposed to ruthless treatment and incessant flogging, and his very life is in danger. Therefore, anyone who effects the ransom of a Jew is praiseworthy and is entitled to the expenses incurred. Moreover, Jews threatened by a common danger may force one another to contribute of their means to the measures that will free them of that danger. A and B have to share the expenses in proportion to their wealth, since they were captured for the purpose of extorting money from them.</p>
<p>R. Meir adds that this question had already been sent to him from Magdeburg. He had also been asked concerning a tutor who was arrested because of a false accusation, and who requested his former employer not to ransom him. R. Meir&#x2019;s answer was the same.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. The leaders of the community demanded that the tutors and scribes who do business in their town, with their own money or with that belonging to others in their hands, pay taxes from such moneys. The scribes and tutors refused to pay the taxes and summoned the leaders to court. The latter refused to appear, claiming that according to the regulations of the community, anyone who is asked to pay a tax must do so, otherwise the community leaders have a right to pawn his property. They see no reason, therefore, why they should answer a summons to court.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The scribes and tutors must first pay the levied tax; for the community is considered to be in possession of the tax money and the burden of proof lies on the individual. But, if the scribes and tutors later summon the leaders of the community to court, the latter must appear and present their claims before that body; for a community is not outside the pale of justice any more than an individual.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. At first all able-bodied men among the Jews, whether rich or poor, took their turn in guarding the gates and walls of the town in which they lived. A rich Jew would often be exempted from the duty by the town officials. Later, the Jewish community and the town officials agreed that the community pay a certain amount of money yearly to take the place of personal service. Must the rich and poor be taxed equally for this purpose?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Although the payment of money takes the place of personal service, the burden of which was shared equally by the poor and the rich, the community should apportion the taxes (to pay for this service) among its members in proportion to their wealth. For the personal service was administered by Gentile town-officials whose acts did not conform to talmudic law, and who often released the rich altogether and put the burden on the poor. Now that the Jewish community has to pay in money for the guarding of the gates, the cost must be distributed justly, i. e. in accordance with talmudic law. Moreover, it became an accepted custom in all communities (tantamount to a law) that when the guarding of the gates is done by the Jews themselves, then every Jew must take his turn regardless of his financial standing. But when, occasionally, a community comes to an agreement with its city officials to pay a special tax in place of the personal service, this tax is apportioned among the members of the community in proportion to their wealth.</p>

<p>R. Meir adds that throughout the kingdom, no taxes on real property are levied by the Jewish communities; that those whose wealth consisted mostly of money, attempted several times to introduce a change and tax real property; and that he, R.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Are houses to be assessed as capital for the purpose of taxation?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The method of allocating taxes is governed by local custom. This rule is explicitly and repeatedly stated in the Talmud (B. K. 116b). In the absence of a local custom, however, one must resort to talmudic law which provides: a) If the tax levied on the town is for the purpose of building a wall, a tower, or a gate, or for other purposes of protection, houses should be assessed as well as capital; b) the houses that attract attention and display opulence by their height, should be assessed accordingly (each house should be assessed in proportion to its effect upon an estimate of the wealth of the community); c) ordinary taxes that are paid yearly to the overlord or the burghers of a town are so paid because of the profits earned in that town; for which reason, houses are exempt from such taxes, while income derived from rent is similar to, and is to be taxed as, any other income (one, however, needs pay no taxes on the house he occupies as his dwelling); d) when the overlord demands an enormous tax of the Jews of the town, such as half their capital, or all their possessions, then houses must be assessed as well as capital.</p>

<h1><bold>581</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A summoned the Community of Friedberg to court and put forth his claims as follows: Long<xref rid="fn7">&#x002A;</xref> before the arrest (of the Jews of Friedberg) the members of the community were called upon to pay the (yearly) tax, and each one declared, under sanction of excommunication, the value of his assets. A told the registrars of the declarations that he possessed seventy <italic>marks</italic>, thirty-seven of his own, and thirty-three that he owed to Gentiles and that were to be repaid immediately; that all his neighbors knew of his obligation immediately to repay that debt; and that he refused to pay taxes for these thirty-three <italic>marks</italic>. The registrars told A that it was not worth his while to argue about the matter since the tax was so small, only three pennies per <italic>mark</italic>. A answered that he feared lest the tax-rate later would be increased; but the registrars assured him of their positive conviction that, with God&#x2019;s help, no increase of the tax-rate would be necessary. A, therefore, agreed to pay the tax on the whole amount. Subsequently the community, including A&#x2019;s wife, was arrested. A, however, was in Frankfort at the time, and he escaped to a place called Hunburg. As soon as he arrived there he was seized by the knights, his creditors, for the purpose of collecting the money due them from him before he became penniless. In order to pay off his creditors, A had to call in his investments immediately and thus had to settle with his debtors for much less than what they owed him. A sent his nephew to the fortress, where the Jews of Friedberg were held in custody, to inform them that he was forced to repay his debts and consequently would be able to contribute toward the ransom of the community only from the money he still had left. The community leaders, however, paid no attention to him, taxed him an amount double the value of his present assets, and delivered his wife into the hands of the king&#x2019;s servants with instructions to detain her and punish her till she pay this amount. A was willing to pay the same tax-rate on the money he now possessed, as the other members of the community had paid, but the amount he had been assessed was well beyond his means. He contended that he should not be expected to pay tax on the money he had owed to others, since he had repaid that money before the amount of the ransom (for the community) was agreed upon. Moreover, Rabbi Meborak, the trustee of the community, admitted to A that the custom of the Friedberg community always was for the members to declare their assets yearly under sanction of excommunication and to pay on the feast of <italic>Hanukkah</italic>, on the basis of such declaration, only the taxes already demanded by that date; while any unforeseen expenses or taxes demanded during the remainder of the year were paid with money borrowed on account of the next year&#x2019;s taxes.</p>
<p>The trustee averred: It is a custom long established in Friedberg, a community where great scholars and <italic>parnasim</italic> (community leaders) have dwelt, that a person pay taxes on the capital he does business with even though a great part of that capital is not his own. A himself has complied with this custom for many years. Now that we have been arrested, wise and discerning men have advised us to use the declarations made before the arrest as a basis for the apportioning of the ransom demanded from us; for, were we to rely on new declarations, since the tax is so excessively high, a few of our members might (by making false declarations) cunningly evade paying their due share.</p>
<p>A rejoined: The custom of paying taxes on capital invested with one by other people, applied only as far as ordinary taxes were concerned. But in the case of ruinous robbery such as the present one, when a person is expected to give away everything he has, how can one give that which is not his&#x0021; Moreover, your decision, to use the former declaration as a basis for levying this tax, was reached without my consent and in spite of my protests. For the purpose of this tax you have evaluated your immovables and your books at half its actual value; an object evaluated at two <italic>marks</italic> was later sold for four <italic>marks</italic>. Who gave you the right to make such evaluation?</p>
<p>The trustee averred: Immovables and books are customarily exempt from taxation. But. for the advantage of the community, the wealthy among us have consented to pay taxes on immovables and books. They have decided, with the knowledge and consent of the whole community, to assess books at their actual cost, i.e. the cost of the parchment plus the scribe&#x2019;s wages. If this arrangement is displeasing to A, they are willing to revert to the generally accepted custom of paying no taxes on such valuables.</p>
<p>A replied: No custom can apply to the present case of ruinous robbery. Moreover, the rich have brought this calamity upon us by their high houses; why, then, should these houses be exempt? A further claimed that when one member of the community was discovered to have transgressed the ban and to have possessed more capital than what he had originally declared, the community confiscated that excess and distributed it proportionately among the tax-payers; and that one rich tax-payer promised to give his part of that excess to A in order to help him ransom his wife. That part amounted to sixteen <italic>marks</italic>, and A demanded that sum. The trustee answered that he did not consult the tax-payer referred to, but that he was sure that the latter would either deny having made such a promise, or would say that he had changed his mind.</p>
<p>Signed: Asher b. Rabbi Yehiel; Yehiel b. Isaak; Joseph b. Nathan.</p>
<p>A further claims that the community leaders have foregone part of the tax of some members, which in some cases amounted to as much as one hundred <italic>marks</italic> and in others to sixty <italic>marks</italic>, in order that these members might agree to the manner of apportioning the tax, while from A they demand that which he does not possess. Also, please instruct us regarding the laws governing the taxation of immovables and books; for I remember what you told us regarding the Mishna, Peah, 8, 9, and the <italic>Yerushalmi</italic> thereto, that you derived from these sources the rule that immovables be assessed at one quarter their value. Books, I believe, should not be taxed at all; if those who study the books are exempt from taxation, the books themselves ought to be similarly exempt. The Torah is termed &#x201C;freedom&#x201D; and ought to be free from the yoke of government. Moreover, house utensils are not taxed. Sometimes a person has many sets of such utensils, which are used only on rare occasions, yet he pays no taxes thereon. How much more reason to exempt books that are used daily by a person or by his sons and sons-in-law, or are lent to others for the purpose of study.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Why did you inquire of me concerning matters of taxation which are rooted in local custom, each community being governed by its own customs? The Talmud states that a person may withdraw from a partnership without the consent of the other partners when each person is attacked by a band of robbers and thus may suffer a loss of money (B. K. 116b). Therefore, if the Jews of Friedberg were accustomed to be partners in payment of normal taxes only, A had a right to withdraw from the partnership with reference to the exorbitant tax which constituted outright robbery. The rule, &#x201C;the law of the land prevails&#x201D;, does not apply to extraordinary taxation, the latter being considered outright robbery. Therefore, since A warned the community to include him in their settlement with the authorities only if he was to bear the burden of the ensuing tax in proportion to the money he had left after paying his debts, the leaders of the community had no right to include him in their settlement unless they agreed to his terms. They should have excluded A&#x2019;s wife from their settlement with the authorities. However if such exclusion of A&#x2019;s wife might have led to her being abused and defiled by the uncircumcised &#x2014; for a report reached us of the Jews of Friedberg having been threatened that unless they speedily come to terms with their captors their wives would be outraged and defiled &#x2014; the leaders of the community were justified in including her in the general settlement in spite of A&#x2019;s protests. A Jew should be ransomed and delivered out of the hands of Gentiles even against his express will, and should be charged with the expenses incurred. Moreover, if the Jews of Friedberg were accustomed to be partners even in the payment of exorbitant taxes &#x2014; for the custom in these kingdoms has been for a long time that there were no normal taxes, and every overlord levied taxes to his heart&#x2019;s content &#x2014; the mere fact that the tax was more exorbitant than the others did not give A the right to withdraw from the partnership. Every tax levied by the overlord must be borne proportionately by all the Jews of the community. Even though A warned the leaders not to include him in the general agreement, except on his terms, his warning was of no avail as long as the leaders did what they thought the right thing. Since in the opinion of the latter it was better to come to terms with the government instead of passively revolting against it, A was bound by the act of these leaders and must contribute his share in proportion to the capital he possessed at the time of the arrest. The fact that he was later forced to repay his debts did not diminish his obligation; for this obligation was not created at the time the agreement was reached with the authorities, but it was created at the time of the arrest, and at that time he still possessed seventy <italic>marks</italic>. A&#x2019;s complaint that some of the members of the community evaluated their immovables and books at less than their actual value, is irrelevant, for the community members have done him a favor by paying a tax on such valuables. Had they refused to pay such tax, no court would have compelled them to pay it. Already in former generations, many persons had complained bitterly before the courts and had demanded that immovables and books be taxed, especially when exorbitant taxes were demanded by the authorities &#x2014; taxes that took away nine tenths of one&#x2019;s capital &#x2014; but the owners of immovables and books were always acquitted in accordance with a long established custom instituted by the &#x201C;ancients&#x201D; [early settlers of Germany and France]. Since many good reasons, as well as the interests of public welfare, support the decision that immovables are not taxable, no court can override the decision of the other courts in this matter, unless the people of your community originally unanimously adopted a different ruling, for a community may change an established custom by a unanimous vote only. Regarding the alleged promise of the rich tax-payer to A, I have little to say as long as the promisor keeps silent. In any case, since the promise was not made formally, the promisor has a right to change his mind at any time. However, A&#x2019;s complaint that the community leaders have foregone certain obligations of some members, is a serious complaint since the leaders have no right to forego A&#x2019;s part of such tax obligations without his consent. But if these leaders were originally unanimously elected freely to manage the affairs of the community, and were thus vested with the power to forego obligations to the community whenever they would see fit to do so, they have acted well within their rights.</p>
<p>R. Meir adds: It is true that I was inclined to derive from the aforementioned talmudic sources the rule that immovables be assessed at one quarter their value, but the long established custom of not taxing such property prevails even in the face of talmudic law. Your arguments for not taxing books are conclusive.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Some members of the community made statements before the bishop [probably regarding their financial status] and swore to the truth of these statements. Subsequently they denied having made such statements. The bishop became enraged and threw some of them into prison. A and his mother-in-law, who had no part in this affair, asked the community to ransom the prisoners and offered to pay their part of the ransom money. The community tried to rescue the unfortunates, but the bishop would not free them. Finally they were freed by the grace of God. The bishop then became reconciled by receiving a certain amount of money, as a fine from the community. The community demanded that A and his mother-in-law contribute their share of the fine. A and his mother-in-law complained to the bishop, who, in his anger, increased the fine. The community now demands that A pay his share of the original fine plus the entire increase of which he was the cause. A claims that the community committed the first wrong by asking the bishop to put the tax on the entire community, after the bishop explicitly imposed the fine only on those members who were guilty of the perjury.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the bishop originally imposed the fine only on those members who took the false oath, those who did not take such an oath are not obliged to pay any part of the fine. As to the increased fine, if A&#x2019;s claim is true, he is not to be held responsible for it. If, however, his claim is false, the community may collect from him any losses it has suffered on his account. The amount of the loss must be established by witnesses. If, however, the community cannot produce any witnesses, and A claims that he caused it no losses, he may take an oath and be free from obligation. But if he admits having caused it some loss, the community may take an oath as to the amount of the loss, and collect that amount from A. A, however, is free only from contributing to the additional tax which was imposed as a fine, but he has to pay his share of the sixty <italic>marks</italic> which is the yearly tax of the community to the bishop.</p>

<p>You ask too much of me in requesting me to arbitrate in this matter. Heaven be my witness that I would not have taken this case even for a large sum of money. But, since you have adjured me, and have informed me that unless I intervene a serious quarrel would break out, I shall go against my inclination to comply with your wish. Briefly, therefore, if you have been accustomed to be partners in the payment of all kinds of taxes to the overlord, viz: normal taxes, exorbitant taxes, poll taxes, tallages, penalties, and whatever other levies came to his mind, you must assess each member, for the present extortion, in the same manner and according to the same procedure as heretofore. If you have been accustomed either to tax real property, or not to tax it, you must not deviate from whatever was the custom except by unanimous consent. But if up to the present you never paid any but normal taxes, if heretofore your overlord never demanded any extraordinary taxes, but was satisfied with collecting the regular, yearly tax, you must search out and follow the custom of German communities. If the custom throughout Germany, when a community is arrested for the purpose of extortion, is to exempt real property from taxation, you must not tax such property; and if the custom is to assess such property at one half, one third, or one quarter, its actual value, you must follow this custom. This is required by strict law; but, I would prefer that you voluntarily adjust your differences and reach some compromise, if possible. You need not further inquire of me regarding this case, for my answer will invariably be the same: either you reach a compromise, follow your local custom, or, in case no local custom exists, follow the custom of your country.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Several Jews lent twenty-one pounds to the dean (<italic>Dechant</italic>), the overlord of the Jews of the city, on condition that he repay them thirty pounds. The dean asked the Jewish community to go surety from him and pay his creditors the thirty pounds, when the next payment of the taxes would be due. The community leaders agreed and gave a writ of indebtedness, bearing their signatures, for thirty pounds to A and B. The dean was deposed before the next payment of the taxes became due and the community was faced with the loss of this money. The community, therefore, refuses to pay the nine pounds interest to the creditors, claiming that since the community became responsible for the original debt contracted by the dean, the payment of the nine pounds, in addition to the twenty-one pounds borrowed by the dean, would constitute usury.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since the creditors settled the interest on the dean as a loan, the dean became obligated to pay his creditors the full thirty pounds, which obligation was governed by the law of the country. The community leaders took over the dean&#x2019;s obligations in the presence of the three parties involved in the transaction, and became obligated to pay thirty pounds to the creditors. Moreover, the community is responsible for the full amount because its leaders went surety for the dean. The suretyship is binding in this case for two reasons: a) Although the suretyship was established after the debt was contracted (and should be invalid unless accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic>) the creditors did not free the dean from his obligations until the community leaders went surety for him; b) suretyship established by community leaders is comparable to one made before a Jewish court and is binding even without a <italic>kinyan</italic>.</p>

After all claims have been carefully examined and found to be baseless, a document is handed to the buyer wherein is written that on a specified date a ban was pronounced in the synagogue and said property was found to be clear of any encumbrance; consequently we have confirmed the buyer in the ownership of this proerty, and henceforth any claim against it that will be raised by a person who was present at the time the ban was pronounced, shall be null and void, and no one shall be permitted to attend such claim in a judicial capacity.</p>

<p>a) <italic>Q</italic>. A was a <italic>Gabbai</italic> (officer) of a cemetery for twelve years. He lent two <italic>marks</italic> to the charity chest of the cemetery. When he took an oath as to his wealth from which he was to pay taxes, he included among his assets the two <italic>marks</italic> due him from the charity chest, and paid taxes for the whole amount. Subsequently he resigned his post as <italic>Gabbai</italic> and demanded that the community order the new <italic>Gabbai</italic> to pay him the two <italic>marks</italic>. When the case appeared at court, A said to the community representatives: &#x201C;I do not ask anything from you.&#x201D; The judges construed this statement to mean that A relinquished his claim, in spite of A&#x2019;s protests that he meant to say that he demanded the money from the charity chest and not from the community.</p>
<p>A. It is customary for charity officers to advance their own money when the charity chest is empty and to collect it afterwards. Such officers&#x2019; claims that money is due them from the chest are believed. Therefore, A is entitled to collect his two <italic>marks</italic>, and his subsequent explanation of his statement &#x201C;I do not ask anything of you&#x201D;, should be accepted.</p>
<p>b) <italic>Q</italic>. Some members of the community are ready to testify in A&#x2019;s behalf. Is their testimony admissible as evidence?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The testimony of residents of a city is admitted as evidence in a case to which all the residents of the city are a party, if their testimony is against the interests of the city residents. Such testimony, however, is not admissible against the relatives of the witnesses.</p>

<h1><bold>594</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. Complying with A&#x2019;s request, the ruler of town T gave A the authority to admit as settlers only those persons of whom A would approve. A claims that B asked him for permission to remain in T for one year telling him that he had settling rights in another place, thus admitting that he possessed no settling-rights in T. B claims that he does possess such rights in T, that his father lived there before him, and denies having asked B for permission to stay there. Should both, B and A, be permitted to stay in T, it might lead to grave consequences, even to the spilling of blood, since B&#x2019;s conduct is known to be corrupt. Rabbi Moses asked what course he should take with respect to their claims.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A produces witnesses to the effect that B asked permission to remain in T for a year, B will have to leave the town, since by his asking for permission he admitted that he either possessed no settling rights there, or had foregone any rights he might have had. If A can produce no such witnesses, B has a right to dwell in T. However, because of B&#x2019;s wicked conduct, you, Rabbi Moses, should deprive B of his settling rights in T and require A to pay adequate compensation to B. I have often seen communities deprive one of their members of his settling-rights because of misconduct; your court that has the right to confiscate a person&#x2019;s money, surely has the right to deprive one of his settling-rights. You should force, therefore, A and B to leave the case completely in your hands to be decided either by arbitration or according to strictly legal requirements, and then you will be able to decide as you see fit.</p>
<p>R. Meir adds:</p>
<p>Your opinion that B lost his settling-rights because of the legal principle &#x201C;the law of the land prevails&#x201D; is untenable. The ruler of T gave A the authority to pass on new settlers, but he gave A no authority to dislodge old residents. Had the ruler of T granted A the authority even to dislodge old residents, the validity of such a grant would depend on the reasons that prompted the ruler to grant such authority. If A asked the ruler for such authority, then A has no right to exercise his authority since by his request he directly injured B&#x2019;s interests. But, if the ruler of T, on his own accord, said that he does not want any Jew to live in T unless he receive A&#x2019;s permission, then A may dislodge B because of the legal principle: &#x201C;The law of the land prevails&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The decision of R. Isaac (b. Samuel, the Tosafist) in the case of the Jews who fled from their town and whose real estate the ruler of the town confiscated and, then, sold to other Jews, has nothing to do with our decision. In this latter case, R. Isaac rightly decided that the purchasers must return the property to the original owners (as compensation, the purchasers were entitled to the amount the original owners would have spent to regain their property) for the ruler had no right to confiscate real property that belonged to the Jews for generations. Such an act on the part of the ruler is not considered &#x201C;law of the land&#x201D; but is rather outright robbery, and, therefore, illegal. In our case, however, the ruler of T is the owner of T and has a right to admit anyone into his town, and to keep out of it anybody he wants to keep out. We cannot claim for B&#x2019;s benefit that his father bought permanent settling rights from the ruler of T and stipulated that he or his descendants could never be dislodged from T, for such transactions were very rare, even though such a stipulation if made would be binding and would render the act of the ruler dislodging B an illegal act.</p>
<p>The decision arrived at in the Talmud (B.B. 54b) accepting as binding the Persian law that if the owner of a field defaults in the taxes for that field, anyone who pays the taxes becomes owner of the field, also, has nothing to do with our case; for taxes on real property accumulate even when the owners are away, while Jews are not required to pay taxes to their overlord, unless they actually live in the domain of these overlords. For Jews are not subjugated to their overlords as the Gentiles are, in the sense that they have to pay taxes to a particular overlord even when they do not live in his domain. The status of the Jew, in this land, is that of a free land owner who lost his land but did not lose his personal liberty. This definition of the status of the Jews is followed by the government in its customary relations with the Jews.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. What is the custom of your locality regarding the admission of the testimony of a single witness as evidence, or of a witness reporting what he had heard from an eye-witness, in disputes involving settling rights?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. We have no definite custom regarding these laws, for we never had a case of this nature. Were we confronted with such a problem, we would inquire of the communities as to the ruling accepted by them.</p>
<p>This Responsum was written by R. Meir in his youth, but in later life he decided that in disputes involving settling-rights, even the testimony of relatives or of witnesses reporting what they had heard from others, should be admitted in evidence; for, in such disputes, it is almost impossible to produce legitimate witnesses. The inhabitants of a town are the only ones who know whether or not a person possesses settling-rights, but such inhabitants are interested witnesses. Moreover, even they rarely remember what had happened years ago, and merely report vague memories, impressions, and hearsay. Therefore, when two groups of witnesses contradict each other, we admit the testimony of the group that has the most members. But usucapion is not a factor in proving settling-rights, since a person may have received permission to stay in town for a limited time only (Tesh. Maim.).</p>

<h1><bold>597</bold></h1>
<p>a) <italic>Q</italic>. M(eir) settled in the town T and lived there for many years buying houses and planting vineyards and groves. While he was alive certain persons contested his right to settle in T, but R. Judah ha-Kohen confirmed M&#x2019;s settling-rights. Now (after M&#x2019;s death) some inhabitants of T seek to oust M&#x2019;s son-in-law claiming that M possessed no settling rights in T.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since R. Judah, my teacher and relative, acting in his official capacity as judge, confirmed M&#x2019;s settling-rights, no one is permitted to contest these rights of M. For, R. Judah deserves complete reliance on, and respect for his decisions. Therefore, you ought to silence all contestants by decree.</p>
<p>b) You state in your letter that two years ago you inquired of me regarding R. Isaac son of Rehabiah whose settling right was contested by the leading inhabitants of the town and that at that time we (?) had confirmed R. Isaac&#x2019;s right on the following grounds: a) witnesses testified that his father dwelt in this town for a year or two without disturbance; b) after his father&#x2019;s death he dwelt here for three years without disturbance; and c) in such cases the court puts forth the claim (for the heir) that had the father been alive he would have claimed to have bought (or obtained) settling-rights from the other dwellers of the town (and would have needed no further evidence under the circumstances). I have heard my teacher R. Judah ha-Kohen decide cases of settling-rights-disputes on the grounds quoted above; but I do not believe that such decisions are correct. According to talmudic law, undisturbed possession is not a factor in disputes involving settling-rights. Persons dwelling on their property during its occupancy by another, do not have to protest such occupancy since they are always in possession of their property (B.B. 29b). Therefore, the failure of the inhabitants of the town to protest against R. Isaac&#x2019;s settling in their midst, is of no consequence, and the decision given above is, indeed, faulty. However, it is possible that my teacher (R. Judah) arrived at such decision by following not talmudic law but community practice. Many communities accept, as legal, methods of proving a person&#x2019;s settling-rights that have no basis in, and that are entirely unacceptable to, talmudic law. For, settling rights are governed by the customs and practices of each particular community. The customs of the various communities differ from one another and are not at all dependent on strict talmudic law. R. Judah, therefore, finding a parallel in talmudic law, wanted to institute the custom of accepting undisturbed possession as a method of proving a person&#x2019;s settling rights. This custom ought to be followed in the communities where R. Judah instituted it (in deference to this scholar), and is in itself worthy to be followed in other communities as well.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. R. Moses maintained that he had settling-rights in the town of Quedlinburg. This claim was supported by the testimony of a single, qualified, witness, who subsequently died. R. Moses, therefore, demanded his rights. The members of the Q. community, however, disclaimed any knowledge of the existence of such settling-rights. Rabbi Isaac, of blessed memory, had instituted the custom of Q. of accepting the testimony of a single witness as evidence, in matters appertaining to settling-rights, and of disregarding testimony of disqualified witnesses.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Although the members of the Q. community are disqualified as witnesses in this case, they may take an oath (as litigants) to rebut the testimony of the single witness. Therefore, if the community will pronounce the ban (against anyone who will make false statements) and the inhabitants of Q. will declare in accordance with this ban that they had never heard that R. Moses had obtained settling-rights in Q., R. Moses will then have no right to settle there. If some of the inhabitants testify that they had heard, or had been told by their parents definitely, that R. Moses had no settling-rights in Q. &#x2014; even if the rest of the inhabitants are silent on the matter &#x2014; R. Moses will not be permitted to settle in Q. because it would constitute an infringement of the rights of these few. Statements of some of the inhabitants in R. Moses&#x2019; favor, would, then, not affect the situation, since they are disqualified as witnesses.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. Your opinion is correct. The inhabitants of T should have brought forth their claims and arguments at the original trial. For the same reason, a person summoned to court by a single inhabitant must not fail to answer the summons, on the ground that he wants to answer the claims of all the inhabitants at a single trial and does not wish to appear in court repeatedly with each individual inhabitant, since all claims against him should be brought forth during his trial when summoned by the single inhabitant or be permanently dismissed.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. The removal of the ban against settlement by waiver is accepted by the communities as legally binding, although, in talmudic law, rights in real property cannot be waived or relinquished unless the waiver be accompanied by a formal act of possession. But since the community denies A&#x2019;s claim, A must produce proof that the ban against settlement had been waived in his favor. A community is in complete possession of its rights and does not have to protest any encroachments on such rights. Therefore one can not claim usucapion as a factor in obtaining possession of community rights. This law is accepted throughout this Kingdom.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A had no settling-rights in T, but lived there for a number of years by permission successively granted to him by the community for definite periods of time. Now, however, a small number of the members of the community refuse to grant him permission for a further stay in T. Your pupil is inclined to think that A is entitled to stay in T long enough to collect his debts. Thus the Talmud rules that bakers and dyers are entitled to three years&#x2019; notice because they usually grant extensive credit, a person who lends money to Gentiles on trust surely requires a great deal of time to collect such debts. Meanwhile, A should be permitted to engage in lending money on a limited scale, just enough to provide for his sustenance.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The talmudic law you quote (B.M. 101b) refers only to a landlord who leased his premises to a baker, or a dyer, for an indefinite period. One who leases his premises for a definite period, however, need give no notice, and the tenant must vacate at the expiration of such period. The specification of a definite period, in itself, constitutes sufficient notice. Since A received permission to stay in T for a definite period of time, he must remove from T as soon as such period expires.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. Undisturbed possession is no proof of rightful ownership unless it be accompanied by a claim of rightful acquisition. Since A does not claim to have bought, or to have received as a gift, settling-rights from B, his undisturbed possession thereof is of no consequence. Moreover, if witnesses testify that A had originally settled in T by resort to violence, even a claim, by A, of rightful acquisition would be of no avail, for a person known to be a robber cannot claim undisturbed possession as proof of rightful acquisition.</p>

<h1><bold>609</bold></h1>
<p>1) <italic>Q</italic>. A&#x2019;s brothers were young when their father died, and A managed his father&#x2019;s estate together with his own business. One day A was arrested for purposes of extortion by the prefect of Ulrich and the overlord of Erstein. In order to extricate himself and be released by them, A cancelled a debt of three hundred and fifty <italic>marks</italic> that was due to the estate from the duke of Brunswick, and freed the sureties of this debt. Thereupon A was released. A&#x2019;s brothers now demand that he should compensate them for the loss of their share of the duke&#x2019;s debt.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A person is not permitted to buy his freedom with money belonging to others. The only exception to this rule is when a poor man hands over to robbers a valuable object deposited with him for safekeeping, in which case the poor man is free from obligation since we must assume that the robbers came expressly for the purpose of obtaining this valuable object (B.K. 117b). When the bailee himself is a wealthy man, however, we are not justified in making such an assumption. Since A is a wealthy man, he must pay to his brothers their share of the actual value of the duke&#x2019;s debt at the time it was cancelled. This law would apply even if it were known that the duke had plotted against A together with the overlords; the law, therefore, surely applies now when, according to the statement of the brothers, the duke was not associated with the overlords in their plot against A. A must also pay to his brothers their share of the interest that had accumulated on the debt before it was cancelled, even though the interest had not been made part of the principal by that time. A, however, must only pay their share of that interest which the duke would have definitely consented to add on to the principal; since the practice is for the debtor to promise a large rate of interest, but when the accumulated interest is to be added on to the principal, the debtor demands, and usually receives, a reduction of the amount of the accumulated interest. This reduction is an established custom and must be reckoned with.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. A deceived the overlord and paid him one hundred <italic>marks</italic> less than what the overlord thought he received. A now claims that these one hundred <italic>marks</italic> belong exclusively to him, and that he gave this money to his brothers by mistake. The brothers, however, aver that A paid them their rightful share of the money.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A may not claim that he paid the money to his brothers by mistake, especially so since according to talmudic law the brothers are fully entitled to their share of the money A saved by deception.</p>
<p>The case was then referred again to R. Meir thus: You, my illustrious teacher, have ruled that since A was a rich man he had to pay to his brothers their share of the actual value of the debt that had been due from the duke.</p>
<p>A, however, claims that with reference to the demands made on him by the overlords, he cannot be considered a rich man, for when he was arrested the lords demanded a ransom of thirty thousand<xref rid="fn9">&#x002A;</xref> (schillings?). His captors enumerated all his investments in great detail in order to prove that he was in a position to pay such ransom. The investments thus enumerated included those that belonged to the estate. A claims that he was arrested because his managing of the estate made him appear a rich man, and because the duke was anxious to cancel the above debt; therefore, he should not be held responsible for the cancellation of this debt. Moreover, the duke died in the meantime. Had A not cancelled the debt, it would have been absolutely worthless anyway, now that the debtor was dead.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The fact that the overlords demanded one thousand <italic>marks</italic><xref rid="fn9">&#x002A;</xref> from A does not prove that he was seeking the money of the estate, for when a person is thrown into prison for purposes of extortion, his rapacious captors first demand a huge sum as ransom, ten times his capital, without knowledge of the actual value of his assets. This is done in order to frighten him, force him to come to terms quickly, and pay a high ransom. Moreover, we must assume that A&#x2019;s captors would not commit such an outrage against the bishop and the burghers merely to cancel a debt of a faithless debtor who had already lost his credit. Your contention that A&#x2019;s captors were intent on cancelling the above debt in order that the overlord should not be called a defaulter, is indeed untenable. The duke did not mind becoming known as a thief, a robber, a highwayman, and an extortionist; why should he object to the appellation defaulter? It is incredible. Therefore, A must pay his brothers their share of the actual value of the above debt at the time it was cancelled.</p>
<p>Regarding the deception A practiced on the overlord by having paid him a lesser amount than what the overlord thought he had received, I have written that A must share the amount thus saved with his partners. This decision I based on the ruling (of the Tosephta, B.M. 8, 25): &#x201C;If publicans relinquish the tax of one partner, the other partners share the benefits thereof.&#x201D; You disagreed with my decision, however, and attempted to draw a distinction between the case of the publicans, who knowingly bestowed a benefit on the partner, and our case where the overlord was unconscious of the fact that the partner was deriving a benefit from him. However, your reasoning serves only to strengthen my ruling instead of weakening it. If a direct gift by the publicans to one partner must be shared by the other partners, then money which was not a gift to A and was not meant as a benefit directly and exclusively for him, must surely be shared with his partners. Moreover, a silent partner is entitled to an equal share in the profits earned by the industry and cunning of the active partner. Although A alone took the risk and braved the danger of severe punishment, he must share the benefits with his partners.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A and B jointly loaned money to a third party. The latter&#x2019;s friends went surety to A for the loan, since A was the active partner. Subsequently, A was arrested by his overlord and was forced to relinquish the debt and to release the sureties. B summoned A to court demanding his share of the loan. A claimed that his arrest was due to the loan and that he cancelled it under duress. B claims that A was arrested for other reasons, and that the investment was lost through A&#x2019;s own fault.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A was arrested because of the aforesaid loan only and was forced simply to cancel the debt and release the sureties, he was free from obligation. Relinquishing another person&#x2019;s debts is a form of tort called <italic>garmi</italic> (damage done indirectly) for which the damager can not be held responsible if he acted under duress. This cancellation of the debt is similar to the burning of another person&#x2019;s notes of indebtedness, which latter act is considered <italic>garmi</italic>, for the debt itself is not cancelled by the burning of the notes of indebtedness; in our case similarly the obligations of the debtors and the sureties were not cancelled by A&#x2019;s act, even according to the law of the land, since A acted under duress. Were A able to summon the debtor and the sureties before a magistrate of another town, the latter would have held them responsible for the debt in spite of A&#x2019;s cancellation. Therefore, if A will take an oath to the effect that he was arrested solely for the purpose of being forced to cancel that debt, he will be free from obligation. R. Meir adds: You did not write A&#x2019;s answer to B&#x2019;s charge that when B tried to collect his share of the debt, A told the debtors they should not pay anything to B, since he, A, was the sole creditor and they owed nothing to B. The reason for this was that if B had been able to collect something on that debt, were it not for A&#x2019;s interference, A would be held responsible for B&#x2019;s loss, unless A was also forced thus to interfere.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A father left to his four sons a girdle and other objects which were pledged by the <italic>landgraf</italic><xref rid="fn10">&#x002A;</xref> as security for a loan of one hundred and ten <italic>marks</italic>. One son, A, who owns a house but has no income, demands that the pledges be divided among the brothers since he and his family are starving for want of bread. The other brothers refuse to do so for the following reasons: 1) The pledges can not be divided among the brothers unless the girdle and the other objects be cut into pieces; 2) the debtor is powerful throughout the kingdom and if his pledges were damaged he would persecute the brothers and the entire community; 3) the pledges are worth less than the debt due. They, therefore, believe that it would pay to wait till peace is established in the country, at which time they might be able to induce the lord, through bribery, to pay his debt together with the accrued interest thereon. A, on the other hand, claims that in the last three years interest of more than four (hundred) <italic>marks</italic><xref rid="fn10">&#x002A;</xref> has accrued; that the interest is four times the value of the pledges; that consequently the lord can have no reason for persecution even if the pledges be cut; and that he, A, can wait no longer since he must feed his children.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Under the circumstances, A cannot force his brothers to divide the pledges among themselves. If he is pressed for money, he may sell his interest in the pledges and the loan either to his brothers or to a stranger. Moreover, if A will receive the lord&#x2019;s consent to the division of the pledges or a guarantee from him (which the community will consider sufficient) that he will not persecute the brothers for such divison, A will be entitled to his part of the pledges.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. R. Eliezer contributed thirteen <italic>marks</italic> to a loan extended to a Gentile. He offered to assign his interest in that loan to his brother A for thirteen <italic>marks</italic>. A accepted his offer and subsequently collected one <italic>mark</italic> as interest for his part of the loan. Is not the <italic>mark</italic> A received considered usury for the thirteen <italic>marks</italic> he gave to R. Eliezer, since a loan to a Gentile cannot be sold to a third party?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since R. Eliezer did not guarantee the loan against default, the thirteen <italic>marks</italic> he received from A in payment therefor does not constitute a loan, and where there is no loan there can be no usury. Therefore, B is entitled to the <italic>mark</italic> profit. The law that a debt cannot be sold to a third party, means that the seller may later retract and may demand the accrued interest; but if the seller foregoes his right to the interest, the buyer may collect it lawfully.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. A must pay B the money coming to B from the Gentile for the following reasons: a) We assume that A became a trustee for B&#x2019;s part of the loan and, therefore, must collect it for B, for how else did B expect to get his money back?; b) A caused a definite loss of money to B and must compensate him for such loss; c) the Gentile became obligated to pay money to B, even though he did not know that part of the money loaned to him belonged to B. Therefore, when the Gentile paid off his debt to A, he gave to A the money he owed to B, and A must give that money to B.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A prominent burgher, a violent man, told A and B that he would take over the obligation of a debtor of theirs, since he himself owed money to this debtor. He invited them to his house in order to give them pledges as security for such debt. When they came to his house he placed pieces of cloth before them. A picked out one piece of cloth, twelve cubits in length, and said that he would like to have it for a Sabbath outfit. The Gentile sold it to him for two <italic>marks</italic> and deducted that sum from the debt. B then told A that he thus owed him one <italic>mark</italic>; but A objected to this claim saying that he took the cloth only because he wanted to withdraw his money from the Gentile, that he intended to keep the two <italic>marks</italic> for himself, and to even the score, he advised B also to buy a similar garment from the Gentile. B refused to buy it. The Gentile, then, gave them the rest of the cloth as security and they departed. Subsequently they returned the cloth in exchange for other pledges; they also held the Gentile&#x2019;s pledges for other debts contracted at various times. All in all, however, the pledges were worth much less than the debts and were never redeemed. Four years later the Gentile died and the pledges lapsed. Now, B demands that he be permitted to take two <italic>marks</italic> out of the pledges, and the remainder be equally divided between the partners; while A demands that the two partners bear the loss in proportion to the money that was due each.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since the burgher was a violent man, A had a right to collect part of his debt independently of B. A had bought the garment for himself, had taken legal possession thereof from the Gentile, therefore, it belonged exclusively to him. Thus his share in the partnership was diminished by two <italic>marks</italic>, and he must now bear a smaller share of the loss; for the loss must be borne by each partner in proportion to his investment.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A Gentile asked A and B for a loan of 30 <italic>marks</italic>. C asked A and B to permit him to join their partnership, and they consented. A, B, and C, arranged the terms of the loan with the Gentile, calculated the amount of the interest, added the interest to the principal, and received the Gentile&#x2019;s sureties for the combined amount. A gave the Gentile four and one half <italic>marks</italic> before the other partners gave him anything. Subsequently, the Gentile informed the partners that he did not need to borrow any more money. Thereupon, A said to B and C that if they wanted to be partners in the above loan, they should each give him one and one half <italic>marks</italic>. B gave his share to A, but C died before he gave anything to A. Subsequently, B collected the principal plus the interest from the Gentile. He gave A one third of the profit saying that he intended to give the other third to C&#x2019;s heirs. A, however, demanded two-thirds of the profit. I believe that A is entitled to two-thirds of the profit, since the Talmud rules that partners collect profit in proportion to the amount each partner invested (Ket. 93b).</p>
<p>Signed: Rabbi Solomon.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. As long as the above partnership was not dissolved, A has acted on behalf of the partnership. Thus, both according to our law and according to the law of the land, the Gentile became indebted, and his sureties became responsible, to the partnership and not to A individually. Therefore, C&#x2019;s heirs are entitled to one third of the profits. The talmudic ruling you quote, however, deals with a partnership that was originally formed on an unequal basis.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. B, C and D with the help of D&#x2019;s father, A, lent money to a Gentile on a pledge that was worth less than the amount of the loan. The Gentile, therefore, put up Gentile sureties for the entire loan. A, originally, agreed to negotiate with the Gentile on condition that he (A) be free from any responsibility should B, C and D sustain a loss through his intervention even though it be as a result of his wilful neglect. Subsequently, A wrote to B and C to return the pledge, and the latter did so. Meanwhile, one of the sureties showed A and D a letter signed by B and C instructing them to release the sureties. Thereupon, they released the sureties. B and C claim that the letter was forged and demand their money from D.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. D had no right to release the sureties until he was absolutely certain of B&#x2019;s and C&#x2019;s instructions. He was not to rely on a letter nor on any signature. Although the sureties were still legally responsible for the payment of the debt until released by B and C, D&#x2019;s release afforded the Gentiles an excuse to evade payment. Since A cannot be held responsible, D must make good B&#x2019;s and C&#x2019;s losses, the amount of which is to be evaluated by the court (not the face value of the loan since it was a bad debt and not worth its face value). If, however, B and C returned the pledge to the Gentile after the release of the sureties by D, though they had no knowledge of such release, the loss of the pledge is to be borne by them <italic>pro rata</italic>. Any additional loss, over and above the pledge, is to be borne by D alone.</p>

When the latter came to repay part of his debt in wine, as he used to do in former years, A and Leah, in B&#x2019;s presence, offered to take five wagons of wine at six pounds per wagon, which offer the Gentile rejected. Subsequently the Gentile met A&#x2019;s son, C, and complained to him about the ill treatment he received at the hands of his creditors. He also told the people in the street, that A, B, and Leah had already collected from him a thousand pounds in interest. To appease him, C agreed to take six wagons of wine for thirty-seven pounds. When A and Leah heard of it, they consented to take the wine, and ordered its delivery. Now, B refuses to accept his part of the wine claiming that he did not consent to the bargain, and that he would seek to collect cash from the Gentile. A claims that B angered the Gentile, who, consequently, repaid almost the entire debt, and thus caused them a considerable loss of money.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Whatever one partner does is binding on all other partners unless they openly protest against that partner&#x2019;s acts. Since B did not protest at the time of the first negotiations, he is bound by the subsequent agreement.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A, B and Leah jointly lent money to one person. The debtor gave them the right to collect the annual produce of a certain village. A claims that B and Leah collected a certain amount of his share of the produce and gave it to farmers on condition that [at harvest time] they repay to B and Leah double the amount advanced. A, therefore, demands whatever B and Leah collected from these debtors. B, on the other hand, claims that he owes nothing to A, and that A collected part of his (B&#x2019;s) share of the produce. Leah claims that she is ready to return to A whatever he will state under oath she has taken from him. She further claims that she did not advance the produce for profit, but that she sold it when the prevailing market price was low.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Each partner must take an oath that he owes nothing to the others. Whoever admits that he took produce belonging to the other, must return it in kind, unless he swears that every year he sold the entire amount of the produce he collected, in which case he may pay by money. The partner who admits to have taken produce belonging to the other partner (or partners) is obliged to return the principal only, but is under no obligation to return any income or interest earned with such produce, for &#x201C;robbers make retribution according to the value of the object at the time it was robbed (B.K. 98b).&#x201D;</p>

C claims that since part of the house belongs to him, and since he was present at the time the article was bought from the Gentile and he was one of the buyers, he is entitled to one-third of the profits. A and B deny C&#x2019;s claim that he was present at the time the article was bought; they admit that they once bought an article in partnership with C, but say that on that purchase they earned no profit.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A, B and C had made an agreement that they be partners in all good business transactions that come to the house, C is entitled to his share even though he was not present at the time the article was bought; for, although a person cannot sell to another anything that is not yet in existence, people may enter into a partnership to divide future gains (not yet in existence) as in such a partnership each partner merely becomes a hired worker to work for the benefit of the other partners. But if no such agreement exists, A and B must take an oath that C was not one of the buyers of the article, and that he was not present at the time the transaction took place and did not say: &#x201C;I want to be a partner to this transaction.&#x201D; If, however, C was present at the time and expressed his desire to be a partner, he is entitled to his share of the profits; for, if one person tells another to lift up for him an article which has no owner, and this person picks it up, the former gains title to it; especially so if the second person is also to gain part ownership in the article, as in the present case.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A and B formed a partnership for the purpose of buying (and selling) silver, and minting coins. Subsequently A admitted C into the partnership. The affairs of the partners became highly complicated giving rise to litigation, each partner pressing various claims and counterclaims against the other. a) B who lent some of the partnership money on interest, and refused to share the profit on this investment with A, claimed that when he formed the partnership he agreed to share the profit arising out of his buying silver and minting coins, but not out of his money-lending transactions, b) A claimed that he had lent forty pounds to B out of the partnership money, and that B did not repay that debt; B averred that he did repay the forty pounds. c) A claimed that B owed fifteen <italic>marks</italic> to the partnership, and that the profits that flowed in from Enns, from Neustadt, and from the minters, were included in the fifteen <italic>marks</italic>. B denied this claim of A. d) A had sent a messenger to Enns to collect ten pounds. The messenger had collected the money but subsequently had lost it. B claimed that A was responsible for this loss since he had appointed the messenger without consulting him. A averred that he had consulted B about it. e) Sixty-one <italic>marks</italic> were found to be missing from the partnership money. B claimed that the money had been lost while in A&#x2019;s possession, and that the latter was responsible for the loss since he had put the partnership money in the custody of his children who were minors.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. a) Since B lent money belonging to the partnership on interest, he must share the profit from these investments with the other partners, even though the partnership was originally formed for other purposes than lending money on interest, unless B had expressly stipulated the condition, at the time the partnership was formed, that he would retain all profits he might earn from money lending; for an agent who employs his principal&#x2019;s money in his own business transactions must share his profits with the principal even though he is fully held responsible for all losses. b) and c) Regarding the other claims and counterclaims of the partners, each partner must take an oath to support his claims and be free from obligation to the partnership. d) A is not responsible for the loss caused by his messenger, since he gave nothing to the messenger, but merely spoke to him. But, if A did give money to the messenger, he must take an oath to support his claim (that he consulted B about appointing the messenger) or to the effect that his partners allowed him a free hand in the management of their affairs, and be free from obligation; otherwise he is to be held responsible for appointing an unreliable messenger. e) If B is positive in his claim that the sixty-one <italic>marks</italic> were lost while the partnership money was in A&#x2019;s possession, A will have to take an oath denying that the money was lost at that time, or be held responsible for that loss; for putting money in the custody of young children is considered wilful neglect; and a partner, being in the category of a gratuitous bailee, is responsible for wilful neglect. A is to be held responsible for the loss of the ten pounds through his messenger and the loss of the sixty-one <italic>marks</italic>, only if such losses had occurred before B joined A &#x201C;in his work&#x201D;; otherwise A can not be held responsible even for wilful neglect, since a bailee is not responsible for losses caused by wilful neglect, if such losses occurred while the owner was with him &#x201C;in his work.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The matter was again sent to R. Meir for his opinion on other problems that arose. f) Regarding the forty pounds lent to B and demanded by A, which B claimed to have repaid, you wrote that both, A and B, were required to take an oath to support their claims. Will A, upon taking such oath, be entitled to collect the forty pounds from B? g) B claimed that A had admitted C into the partnership without his permission. If not for this act of A, he, B, would have earned thirty pounds. A denied B&#x2019;s claim. h) B claimed that towards the end [of their business venture] they had been offered six pounds for the coin [probably the coin-matrix], but that A did not permit him to sell it for that price, while refusing to buy it himself, and thus they lost the six pounds. i) B claimed that C and the &#x201C;officers&#x201D; [probably the officers of the mint] owed money to the partnership, but that A refused to collect this money. j) A claimed that the sixty-one <italic>marks</italic> allegedly missing from the partnership money, really represented the payment he had made to the &#x201C;treasurers&#x201D; in order to free his partners from their obligations to them. He demanded, therefore, that B pay his share of this payment. B stating that the &#x201C;treasurers&#x201D; depended on him for the repayment of his obligation, denied A&#x2019;s claim and said that A did not go surety for him and was, therefore, not required to pay B&#x2019;s obligation. B further claimed that the above-mentioned money was actually lost because A put it in the custody of his young children. A&#x2019;s youngest child, however, is fifteen years of age.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. f) If B takes an oath to the effect that he repaid the forty pounds to A, the partners may hold A responsible for these forty pounds. But if A subsequently takes an oath to the effect that B did not repay the forty pounds, A will be free from obligation to his partners regarding that sum. g) A must take an oath to support his claim. However, if at any time B had shown satisfaction with C&#x2019;s being admitted to the partnership, A&#x2019;s oath is unnecessary. h) Since A did not allow B to sell the coin [matrix] for six pounds hoping to sell it later for more, he can not be held responsible merely because his expectations were not realized. j) Since the money belongs to the partnership, B can sue C and the &#x201C;officers&#x201D; directly because of the &#x201C;lien of R. Nathan&#x201D; (garnishment). But, if the &#x201C;officers&#x201D; are Gentiles and the law of the land does not recognize the validity of the law of garnishment, A must institute proceedings against the &#x201C;officers.&#x201D; k) I have already written to you that A is not to be held responsible even for losses occasioned by wilful neglect since B was with him &#x201C;in his work.&#x201D; Moreover, since A&#x2019;s youngest child is fifteen years of age, the putting of money in the custody of his wife and children cannot be considered wilful neglect, since a bailee is expected to deliver his bailment into the hands of his wife and grown up children (B.M. 36a). If the partners, however, have not as yet divided the partnership money among themselves, B may exact an oath from A&#x2019;s children (but not from his wife until she be widowed or divorced) to the effect that they have not misappropriated any of the partnership money. He may exact this oath because of &#x201C;the lien of R. Nathan.&#x201D; Regarding A&#x2019;s claim to have paid B&#x2019;s obligations to the &#x201C;treasurers&#x201D;, B is free from obligation for that sum; for a person who repays the debt of another has no claim on the latter. However, if A claims that he went surety to the &#x201C;treasurers&#x201D; for B, the latter must take an oath denying this claim of A, or asserting that he owed nothing to the &#x201C;treasurers.&#x201D;</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A, B, C, and D, were partners in a loan made by them. In repayment they received a quantity of silver which they divided among themselves by lot. Subsequently, A bought B&#x2019;s silver and sold it to merchants [probably Gentile merchants]. The latter broke up the silver and found it mixed with base metal. A averted a calamity by pacifying the merchants with gifts of money, thus preventing their bringing false accusations against him. A demands that B reimburse him with the price of the silver, and also compensate him for the money he had spent in pacifying the merchants.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The sale of the silver to A is void, since it was made in error. Similarly, the division of the silver among the partners is void, even though made by lot, since that too was made in error. However, B is not required to compensate A for the money he spent in pacifying the merchants, since B did not know, at the time of the sale, that his silver contained base metal. Moreover, even if B knew the contents of his silver, he would still be absolved from paying A the money he had given to the merchants, since he was only an indirect cause of A&#x2019;s loss, though he would be liable to punishment by the Heavenly Court.</p>

<p>1) <italic>Q</italic>. A claims that B misappropriated money from their partnership. B denies A&#x2019;s claim.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If B will take the &#x201C;partners&#x2019; oath&#x201D;, he will be free from obligation. Although after a partnership is dissolved, an ex-partner is no longer required to take the &#x201C;partners&#x2019; oath&#x201D;, in this case, since B must take oaths in support of his other claims as against A, he must include an &#x201C;entailed oath&#x201D; regarding the above claim.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. B&#x2019;s former partners claim that the Gentile who seized from B valuables that belonged to the partnership, has seized them, as the Gentile claimed, in payment of money B owed him. B denies having owed anything to the Gentile.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Although Gentiles are robbers, and their excuses for seizing property from Jews are not to be taken seriously &#x2014;ordinarily such a claim would not require an oath of denial on the part of B &#x2014; in this case, however, B must take an &#x201C;entailed oath&#x201D;. On the other hand, if B should admit that he owed money to the Gentile, he would have to pay this money to his former partners.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. A neutral party is believed without an oath. We cannot require an oath of B; for if we do, no one will do a favor for a friend lest he claim to have stipulated conditions for such a favor and the benefactor would be required to take an oath. Therefore, B is free from any obligation to A unless the latter claims that B received the two <italic>marks</italic> from C, in which case B has to take an oath to the effect that he did not receive anything from C.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. When A was imprisoned the community delegated B to endeavor to release him. A claims that he sent books to B, which were valued at twelve <italic>marks</italic>, so that B, using the books as security, might procure a loan from the charity-chest at its regular rate of interest; and that he, thus, owes B nine pounds N&#x00FC;rnburg coins, which he is ready to repay. He demands that B permit him to redeem his books. B claims: a) that when A gave him the books, he, A, undertook to make good all damages incurred in securing the loan; b) that he, B, suffered damages because of his endeavors on A&#x2019;s behalf; c) that A sent word to R. Yedidyah and to B, to sell two books; d) that he, B, gave the two books to Rabbi Yedidyah who sold them, but who now refuses to give the money to B. A, however, claims that he only advised B to secure the aid of Rabbi Yedidyah in selling the books, since R. Yedidyah knew their value and how to sell them, but that he did not permit B to give the books to R. Yedidyah. Moreover, A claims that R. Yedidyah retains the money he received for the two books, for a debt B owes him. B denies that he owes money to R. Yedidyah.</p>
<p>A. If B admits that he received A&#x2019;s books, he is responsible for them. If, however, B claims that A gave him permission to give the books to R. Yedidyah, he must take an oath to that effect and then be free from obligation. Moreover, if A usually entrusted his valuables to R. Yedidyah, B is free from obligation without taking an oath. As to the damages B claims to have suffered on A&#x2019;s accounts because he went surety for A to Gentiles, if he has in his possession money belonging to A, he may take an oath as to the amount of damages he suffered, and be entitled to retain that sum. For if one Jew goes surety to a Gentile for another Jew, the latter must make good all damages suffered by the surety because of his suretyship, excepting damages caused by his wilful neglect. At first I was told that this law was an ordinance enacted by the communities, but now I realize that it is sound talmudic law (based on B. K. 114a: &#x201C;thou hast placed a lion next to my field&#x201D;). If, however, B has in his possession no money belonging to A, A may take an oath that he expressly undertook to be responsible only for the interest of a loan secured from the charity-chest, and be obligated to pay B only such interest.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. B gave money to A for the express purpose of paying the Gentile. As long as A does not pay the Gentile, the money belongs to B and A has no right to keep it. Moreover A has no right to give the money to the Gentile after the latter forgot about it; for, if A wants to sanctify the name of the Lord by paying the Gentile money the latter forgot about, let him (A) do so with his own money, as he cannot use another person&#x2019;s money for such a purpose.</p>

If witnesses testify that the debtor owed money to A at the time B released him, B must reimburse A with the amount the debt was worth before the debtor and the sureties were released by B. If there are no witnesses to determine the value of the debt, B must state under oath the extent of the damage he has caused to A, and must compensate him for this damage. But, if A can produce no witnesses to testify that the debtor owed him money, B is free from obligation. We must be satisfied with B&#x2019;s explanation of his act, since he could have denied his act altogether, and since A might have instructed B to release his debtor for the simple reason that the debtor had repaid his debt.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. What laws govern those transactions which fall in the category of <italic>asmakta</italic>?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Such transactions are valid if accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic> and concluded before an authoritative court. However, some <italic>asmakta</italic> transactions are valid even when not accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic> and not concluded before an authoritative court. Thus the Talmud rules that if a person lends money to another against a field, and the debtor says that in case he does not repay the debt within three years title to the field shall have vested in the creditor from now on, the transaction is valid (B.M. 65b, 66b). An earnest deposited in connection with a marriage engagement becomes forfeited upon the breaking of the engagement, even though the original transaction was not made before an authoritative court and was not accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic>. A mere promise to pay a fine to charity, as when a person promises to give a certain amount to charity in case he plays cards, is also binding. Regarding this law I wrote at length in a Responsum, which you will find in the possession of our friend R. Isaac of Straubing, and is too long to be repeated here. A decision by a court of arbitration is not binding unless the acceptance of the judges by the litigants was accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic>. Search further in the sources and you will learn the details of these laws.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. B bought an article from A. Having no money, B delivered a pledge to A as security for the price of the article, with the understanding that should B not repay his debt to A by a specified date, A should have the right to rehypothecate B&#x2019;s pledge through a Gentile, and B would be responsible for the principal and the interest of that loan. Is such a transaction considered <italic>asmakta</italic> and, therefore, invalid?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A became B&#x2019;s agent to procure a loan for him; the transaction is, therefore, valid.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A agreed to buy a house from B. They deposited five <italic>marks</italic> (each) with C as liquidation damages in case of a breach of contract. B bound himself to reconcile all persons who might protest against the sale. B&#x2019;s neighbor protested, claiming that he wanted to buy the house and demanding his priority rights. When the case came to our court, we (the judges) decided that the agreement between A and B was an <italic>asmakta</italic>, and therefore, void. Moreover, even if B&#x2019;s promise to reconcile all those who might protest against the sale, were made before an authoritative court and strengthened by a <italic>kinyan</italic>, it would be void, since it is incumbent upon the buyer to do &#x201C;what is just and good in the eyes of the Lord,&#x201D; (namely, to deliver the house to the owner of the adjoining premises), and the seller has nothing to do with it. Subsequently, the neighbor refused to buy B&#x2019;s house. Neither A nor anyone else was willing to pay for the house the amount A had originally offered. B, therefore, sued his neighbor for damages. We (the judges) decided that the neighbor is under no obligation to B since he did not cause B any damage directly.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Your decisions are correct. But your statement: &#x201C;even if the above promise were made before an authoritative court&#x2026; etc.&#x201D; is wrong, since it was in B&#x2019;s power to reconcile his neighbor by paying him a certain sum of money.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A sold his house to B and undertook to settle with the abutter so that the latter would not take the house away from B. The abutter, also, told B that having no money he did not want to buy the house. B, however, failed to bind the abutter by a <italic>kinyan</italic>. A borrowed jewelry from his wife and deposited it with C stating: take formal possession of this jewelry on condition that if I fail to settle with the abutter it will belong to B from now on. B, on the other hand, deposited twenty<xref rid="fn12">&#x002A;</xref> <italic>marks</italic> with C as a guaranty that he would pay the price of the house and that he would not change his mind. After the transaction was concluded, however, the abutter obtained money, paid off B, and took away the house; B, therefore, demanded of C that he turn over to him the valuables A had deposited with him. C told A in the presence of witnesses of B&#x2019;s demand and A replied that he should give the valuables to B &#x201C;since it is legally coming to him&#x201D;. Is B entitled to the valuables?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A gave the valuables to C in order that he deliver them to B should a certain condition not be fulfilled. Such a transaction is called <italic>asmakhta</italic> and is not binding since it was not made before an authoritative court. When A finally told C to deliver the valuables to B, he was acting under misapprehension that they were due him legally, as his statement indicates. His order, therefore, was not binding and B should return the valuables to A.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. It is the custom of judges to consider as valid conditional transactions classified as <italic>asmakhta</italic>, and even to enforce the collection of the money-fines stipulated in such transactions, when they were accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic> made before an authoritative court. How can the judges enforce the collection of such money when R. Hai Gaon and R. Hananel ruled that these transactions were invalid? Moreover, occasionally the conditional transaction is not concluded before an authoritative court, but the scribe inserts the phrases: &#x201C;accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic>, made before an authoritative court&#x201D;, as a mere formality. Why should the signature of two witnesses to such writ suffice? Why not require the signatures of three persons, those of the prominent men of the community?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The ruling that a conditional transaction accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic> made before an authoritative court is valid, is based on the weighty opinions of R. Zemah Gaon, Rashi, Rashbam, R. Tam, and Ri, while the opinion of R. Hai Gaon is untenable. As to your second objection, if the scribe was instructed by the contracting party (or parties) to draw up the contract, we assume that he was thus instructed to draw up a valid contract in accordance with accepted custom. Since it is customary to insert the phrase cited above in a conditional contract, the scribe was thus instructed to insert it in the contract, and we interpret such instruction as an admission by the defendant that the transaction had taken place before an authoritative court. Were two other witnesses to testify before us that the writ was drawn up by the undersigned witnesses who recorded an ordinary <italic>kinyan</italic> made in their presence, as a <italic>kinyan</italic> made before an authoritative court without their (the latter witnesses) having been instructed to draw up a valid contract, the contract would be void. Lacking such testimony we must rely on the signatures of the two witnesses as proof that the transaction was concluded before an authoritative court; the responsibility for any irregularity must rest upon such witnesses.</p>

<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. A sold merchandise to B on credit. Before payment was due A asked B to give him back his merchandise since B found difficulty in selling it and would therefore not be able to pay on time.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A bought silver from B. Having no money to pay for it, he gave B a quantity of gold on condition that should he fail to pay B within three days, B would have the right to raise money against such gold by using it as security on an interest-bearing loan, or by having the money-changers exchange it for money, or by resorting to any other possible manner of raising money. B, however, pledged the gold with C on condition that it become forfeited after two weeks shall have elapsed, should A fail to redeem it within that time. A did not redeem his gold within the stipulated time. Now A demands that B return his gold since he never intended to allow B to pledge his gold on such unusual, and extremely unfavorable, conditions. By the phrase &#x201C;any other possible manner&#x201D; he meant to permit the employment of customary methods of raising money against security, and no more. Moreover, B did not necessarily have to raise a loan. He could have taken off a piece of the gold commensurate in value with the money due him, and returned the remainder to A; since gold bullion lends itself to such treatment without the necessity of appraisal [by a court]. B, on the other hand, claims that knowing what a dilatory debtor A was, he refused to do business with him until A gave him the gold and specified that it could be used to raise money &#x201C;in any possible manner&#x201D;, the last phrase to be taken literally. He further claims that he could not raise the money in any other way than on the terms made with C, and that he informed A about this transaction with C, and that A agreed to it. A, however, denies B&#x2019;s assertions and claims that he was informed of the transaction with C after he had mounted his horse and had been ready to ride on his way, and that he did not realize at the time the meaning of B&#x2019;s words.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Even assuming the truth of B&#x2019;s version of his agreement with A, such agreement is considered an <italic>asmakhta</italic> and is not valid unless accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic> and made before an authoritative court. Therefore, B must pay to A the difference between the value of A&#x2019;s gold and the amount due B. Moreover, B&#x2019;s agreement with C regarding the forfeiture of the pledge is also considered an <italic>askmakhta</italic> and is invalid.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. Even if B had not, as yet, paid for the horse, the burden is upon him to prove that the horse was injured while in A&#x2019;s possession.

He is ready to return A&#x2019;s money if the latter will swear that he, B, guaranteed the vessel to be of gold, or if A will return to him the vessel in the condition he received it. However, A cannot return the vessel in the same condition, since he had broken it.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If it is certain that the vessel B sold A was partly made of lead, the sale is void, since A intended to buy a gold vessel and not a lead one. A cannot be held responsible for breaking the vessel and thus diminishing its value, since he was not supposed to know that it contained lead.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A Gentile wanted to buy a certain silver vessel from A. A, who had no such vessel to sell, wanted to take the Gentile to another Jewish dealer, but the Gentile commissioned A to buy the vessel for him. A went to B who was willing to sell a vessel weighing three pounds. A said to B: &#x201C;The Gentile is my friend and I do not want to deceive him; if the vessel is truly made of silver, I shall buy it, otherwise, I shall not.&#x201D; B assured A that the vessel was made of silver, and added that since the silver was alloyed with a little copper, he was willing to accept forty-seven shillings for it. A took the vessel at night and sold it for fifty shillings to the Gentile who carried it away the same night. The Gentile, subsequently, complained that A deceived him, as the vessel was really made of copper. He, therefore, returned the vessel and forced A to refund him the money. A demanded that B take back the vessel, but B claimed that A saw what he was buying and accepted it for the stipulated price.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since B sold A a silver vessel and gave him a copper one, the sale is void and B must refund the money to A.</p>

If A claims that his horse was not a stolen horse and that the Gentile took it away unjustly, or that he (A) had no knowledge that it was a stolen horse, he is not responsible (since we cannot rely on the Gentiles&#x2019; word). If, however, B can prove that at the time of the transaction A knew that it was a stolen horse and that the Gentile had a right to take it, B may keep his wine.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. Since the books were taken by Gentile robbers, A did not lose hope of retrieving them (B. K. 114a) and thus legally retained title to his books. Therefore, B must return the books to A. B is not entitled to any compensation, since it was common knowledge that A was robbed of his books, and since B bought them from known robbers.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. A owes that amount to B. Since the court has a right to distrain a debtor&#x2019;s article for the benefit of the creditor, the court may surely confirm B in the possession of the book after the latter pays to A the difference between its actual value and the price he had originally paid.

At B&#x2019;s request, A secretly transported the wool to Mayence on a boat and sold it to C. The latter paid A part of the price, and specified a date for the payment of the balance. The robbed merchants, discovering the whereabouts of their wool, came to Mayence and sued C. C, however, bribed the city and court officials and thus evaded prosecution by the merchants. When A came to collect from C the balance due him, the latter deducted, from that balance, the amount he was forced to pay in bribes, despite A&#x2019;s claim that he, A, had given no warrant that no claims would be made by the original owners. B, on the other hand, charged A with the blame for C&#x2019;s act and demanded his share of the full price.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A and B must make good the losses C suffered, since, in this case, the Gentile merchants had a just claim on the merchandise. C must, therefore, prove by oath or witnesses the amount he was forced to expend in the form of bribes, and deduct this from the balance due A and B.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A negotiated to buy from a Gentile a house which bordered on B&#x2019;s property. After A agreed with the Gentile on the terms of the sale, he withdrew his offer so that the Gentile should lower his price. He warned B not to negotiate with the Gentile since he, A, was still negotiating with him. B, however, disregarded A&#x2019;s warning and bought the house from the Gentile. In defense B claims that he had sought to purchase the house from the Gentile before A began his negotiations. Should B be punished for his act as violating the talmudic injunction against &#x201C;a poor man turning a cake, and another coming and taking it (Kidd. 59a)?&#x201D; How long should one refrain from offering to purchase an article which another Jew is seeking to buy?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. R. Jacob Tam applies the aforesaid talmudic injunction only to mercantile pursuits but not to cases where a person is about to pick up a lost or ownerless object and another snatches it away. For finding a lost object is a rare opportunity and the second person is just as much entitled to the ownerless object as the first person. Buying abutting property from a Gentile is also a rare opportunity and is in the same category as picking up lost objects. Therefore, B is free from any obligation to A. A Jew should not approach a seller where another Jew had already agreed with the seller for the sale of the article, and where the writing of the contract and the scrutiny and transfer of the deed in the Gentile courts are the only things lacking in order to complete the sale. But, the mere offer of a Jew to buy something without the seller&#x2019;s acceptance of the offer, does not restrain another Jew from buying it. If such were the case, it would be very unfair to the seller who would be forced to sell his possessions to the very first bidder, no matter how low the offer, since no other purchasers would dare to buy it. The Torah was very careful, however, not to jeopardize the rights and opportunities of the sellers.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. C gave his house to his son B as an outright gift. In the deed of transfer C wrote that the gift was to be irrevocable, but stipulated the following conditions: a) During his lifetime he, C, reserves the power to dispose of his property in whatever manner he deems proper, to rent, exchange, and even sell it; b) the income from that house (for the aforementioned period) shall go to him; c) in case he loses all his other possessions, he shall have the right to sell this house. In conclusion, however, he added: d) that should he desire to grant dowries to his other daughters, similar to the one he has given to his first son-in-law, he would have no right to dispose of any part of the aforementioned house for that purpose. After C&#x2019;s death, his other son, A, demanded that B give him his share of his father&#x2019;s estate. In answer to B&#x2019;s assertions that the house belonged to him exclusively, A stated that C had voided the aforementioned deed of transfer and subsequently wrote another deed whereby he transferred the house to A and to A&#x2019;s sisters, and that C had the right to do so since he had reserved in the first deed during his lifetime the power to dispose of his property in whatever manner he deem proper (stipulation a).</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The house belongs to B since his father had given it to him as an outright and irrevocable gift. Although some of the added stipulations of the deed, seem to contradict and to cancel the original provision of the deed that the gift be irrevocable, still whenever possible a deed must be interpreted in a manner that will reconcile and explain away all apparent contradictions. Thus, stipulation a of the above gift must be interpreted to refer to the remainder of C&#x2019;s property, but not to the house itself. A person does not write a deed and cancel its purpose at the same time. Furthermore, after C had formally given the house to B in the presence of witnesses, he no longer could refer to it as &#x201C;my property&#x201D;. Moreover, the final clause of the aforementioned deed, stipulation d, proves that the father did not revoke the gift. Consequently, C had no right subsequently to give the house to A and to his sisters.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A had two sons and one daughter. He gave his daughter in marriage to B and promised him by a written document that after his (A&#x2019;s) death, B would receive a share of A&#x2019;s estate equal to that of an heir. After A&#x2019;s wife died, A remarried and had two sons by his second wife. After her death, he gave presents to her young sons and expressly stated that these were to be in addition to their share in his estate after he should die. Subsequently, A lost his mind and three years later, he died. B demanded one-third of A&#x2019;s estate since at the time the promise of the gift was made to him, A had only two heirs. The grandfather of the younger orphans, acting as their representative, claimed that only one-sixth of the estate was due B, since two parts were to go to A&#x2019;s first-born son. Moreover, the representative demanded the <italic>ketubah</italic> of A&#x2019;s second wife, for her children, as <italic>ketubat benin dikrin</italic>. Subsequently, B admitted in the presence of many witnesses, that he knew the place where A hid his valuables. In order that he disclose the place of the hidden valuables, the representative of the orphans entered into an agreement with B, which agreement was strengthened by a <italic>herem</italic>, whereby B was to receive one-fifth of A&#x2019;s estate. Now B refuses to live up to the agreement and demands one-third of the estate.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B is entitled to one-sixth of that property which he can prove A possessed at the time of making the promise of the gift to B. The agreement with B should, therefore, not bind the orphans since it was entered into to their disadvantage. Moreover, the sons are entitled to collect their mother&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic> as <italic>ketubat benin dikrin</italic>, before the estate is divided among the heirs. Although many of the <italic>Geonim</italic> wrote that the <italic>ketubat benin dikrin</italic> is not collectible nowadays (the reason being that such an ordinance was originally instituted in order that fathers willingly give their daughters dowries equal to whatever they give to their sons, but nowadays fathers give more to their daughters than to their sons) R. Hai Gaon and the Tosaphists were of the opinion that it is collectible; and we follow the latter opinion. However, since the representative of the orphans entered into the agreement in order to recover A&#x2019;s hidden valuables, the agreement with B is valid. B will find it to his advantage to abide by the agreement and not break a <italic>herem</italic>, for he is really entitled to much less than what he is getting under the agreement. B, however, will have to state under oath the amount of A&#x2019;s valuables he has in his possession.</p>

<p>1. <italic>Q</italic>. We are sorry to trouble you about a case that has already been decided upon by the authoritative court of Rabbi Aaron. But the litigants are stubborn and troublesome, and we are forced to solicit your opinion. Two witnesses testify that, before his death, A&#x2019;s father instructed his wife to give thirty pounds to each one of his sons. She did not protest although he left her only a small piece of ground. A demands his thirty pounds. He also claims that, upon his marriage, his mother promised his wife, by solemn hand-clasp, to help him financially as long as she has a penny left, and that his mother took ten pounds from him. A&#x2019;s mother, on the other hand, denies that her husband told her to give money to her sons; she further denies having taken the ten pounds from A, or having promised anything to A&#x2019;s wife. Moreover, she claims to have spent more than thirty pounds on A, since she reared him, and since she educated him up to the age of thirty. She, therefore, demands her <italic>ketubah</italic> from the remainder of the money A&#x2019;s father left. Finally, the mother claims that she was sued by all the heirs in the court of R. Aaron, that the court decided in her favor, and that she still has the written decision.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. No court is allowed to review the decisions of another court; therefore, the decision of R. Aaron must prevail. But, since A claims that at the time of the first trial the heirs had no reliable witnesses to support their claims, and that now he has found two reliable witnesses who support his claim, the testimony of these witnesses must be taken into consideration, and A&#x2019;s mother must take an oath that she spent at least thirty pounds on A&#x2019;s education and upbringing. The court cannot impose an oath on A&#x2019;s mother regarding the promise, accompanied by a solemn hand-clasp, that she is alleged to have made to A&#x2019;s wife, since the mother denies having made such a promise.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. A&#x2019;s last words are of no consequence since he was not in his right mind while uttering them. Therefore, if A&#x2019;s daughters admit that A had promised L three <italic>marks</italic> as part of her dowry and had not paid it to her, L is entitled to collect three <italic>marks</italic> in addition to the <italic>causa mortis</italic> gift, for while A, on his death-bed, gave presents to his other daughters, he probably intended to make no exception in his dealing with L. But, if the other daughters disclaim any knowledge of A&#x2019;s debt, they must take an heir&#x2019;s oath.

Before Leah remarried, she entrusted the two pounds to her cousin, Rabbi Yedidyah, who was also A&#x2019;s brother, as a trust fund for her daughter. Her second marriage, to the son of R. Isaac of Coburg, was an unhappy one as she had to wander from town to town with her children on her shoulder to procure her daily sustenance, not receiving any support from her husband. She succeeded, however, in saving the sum of twenty-two schillings which she deposited with her mother in payment of a silken garment, valued at three pounds, which she bought for her daughter. When her husband learned about it, he went to Leah&#x2019;s mother and tricked her into giving him the garment. Leah then demanded her daughter&#x2019;s garment from her husband. The latter, however, claimed that, since whatever a wife possesses belongs to her husband, the silken garment belonged to him. He further demanded that Leah return to him all the garments and objects she had given to her daughter.</p>
<p>Rabbi Moses was the judge in the case and decided that Leah must take an oath that she did not give to her daughter directly or indirectly any money belonging to R. Isaac&#x2019;s son. Rabbi Yedidyah then wrote to R. Meir, and, enclosing a copy of R. Moses&#x2019; decision, argued against it since he thought that R. Moses imposed an oath on Leah even though her husband was not positive she took his money and maintained only a possibility of it. R. Meir wrote his opinion that we can impose an oath on a wife only when the husband is positive that she misused his money, (which was in seeming contradiction to that of R. Moses). He sent this opinion to R. Yedidyah and adjured him to show it only to R. Moses who, R. Meir hoped, would retract his decision. R. Moses, however, felt humiliated, protested that Leah&#x2019;s husband was positive in his claim, and produced a statement from the local <italic>Beth-din</italic> which read: &#x201C;Our teacher, Rabbi Meir: We let you know that the husband was positive in his claim and enumerated all the things he demanded of his wife. Since he was positive in his claim, and did not merely suggest a possibility of it, we have imposed an oath on the wife as advised by our teacher, Rabbi Moses.&#x201D; R. Moses further stated that R. Yedidyah made public R. Meir&#x2019;s letter and caused him great shame and humiliation. R. Meir, then, withdrew from the case, saying that he did not want to be a party to the personal quarrel between R. Yedidyah and R. Moses unless he could effect a reconciliation between the two.</p>

<h1><bold>676</bold></h1>
<p>Your statement is correct. The act of a married woman who disposed of her clothes on her death-bed, is invalid. The clothes must be returned to the husband. For a husband buys raiment for his wife only for the purpose of her wearing them, not for the purpose of her giving them away. Although the husband was present at the time the gifts were made, and did not protest, his silence did not indicate consent. It rather showed a knowledge that his wife&#x2019;s act was invalid, and required no protest.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Before her death, Leah, in the presence of witnesses, said: &#x201C;All my possessions shall go to B and C except what I have already given to charity.&#x201D; After her death, B and C found some of her possessions in A&#x2019;s hands. They demanded these possessions from A who, in turn, claimed that Leah gave them to him as a gift <italic>mortis causa</italic> before she gave anything to B and C.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If, while making the gift to A, Leah indicated that she was making such a gift in fear of approaching death, then her final words, giving everything to B and C, prevail, since she probably changed her mind regarding her gift to A. A, then, must return the property to B and C. But, if Leah made no mention of death when she gave some of her possessions to A, then such a gift is in the category of a &#x201C;sick man&#x2019;s gift of part of his property&#x201D; (Baba Batra 151b) which requires a <italic>kinyan</italic> (formal act of possession). Since in this case, there was a <italic>kinyan</italic> (the property was in A&#x2019;s possession at the time of the gift), the property belongs to A.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. While critically ill, Mrs. Maimona said to the representative of the community that after her death the following matters should be attended to at her expense: 1) That the oil-lamp which burns during the services in the memory of her departed daughter, should be made to burn continuously day and night; 2) that every Friday evening a half-pound waxen candle should be lit in the synagogue in her memory; and 3) that half a <italic>mark</italic> should be expended on a <italic>kiddush</italic>-cup for the synagogue. When the representative asked her as to the source of the money for these expenditures, she answered pointing at an adjoining room: &#x201C;You will find sufficient valuables and money in that room.&#x201D; The following day, a Friday, she called her brother Zemah and told him, in the presence of witnesses, to take for himself and for his sisters everything he finds in the room mentioned above. On the following Sunday, the representatives of the community came and asked her the whereabouts of the money she promised for the synagogue, but she refused to reveal anything. The representatives, therefore, broke into the room and took everything they found there. They also pronounced the <italic>herem</italic> against anyone who would not return to the community valuables or money belonging to Mrs. M. which might be in his possession. R. Isaac ha-Kohen admitted that Mrs. M. had deposited eight Cologne-<italic>marks</italic> with him and had told him that after her death he should do with the money &#x201C;the proper thing.&#x201D;</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Mrs. M. probably withdrew her promise to donate something to the synagogue. A gift made <italic>causa mortis</italic> even to a holy cause can be rescinded. The money and valuables found in her room, therefore, belong half to R. Zemah and half to his sisters. R. Isaac must return the eight <italic>marks</italic> to Mrs. M&#x2019;s heirs, for the proper thing to do with money of a deceased person, is to return it to the heirs.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Before her death L(eah) distributed her property in the presence of witnesses and added that the residue should go to her relative A, an orphan. R(achel), another relative of L, took care of L during her sickness, and received from her the keys to everything in the house. After L&#x2019;s death it was learned that R appropriated some of L&#x2019;s money and articles. A summoned R to court where she claimed to have received said valuables from L as a present. Must she return the valuables to A?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the valuables can be identified as having definitely belonged to L, and if witnesses saw such valuables in R&#x2019;s possession, R must prove that L gave them to her as an outright gift (not <italic>causa mortis</italic>) before she will be entitled to retain them. But, if the articles can not be so identified, or, if no one saw them in R&#x2019;s possession, R must take an oath that she received them as an outright gift. We would have to accept such an oath because of the principle of <italic>Miggo</italic>, since, in the absence of witnesses, R could have denied the charge altogether. However, if witnesses testify, or R herself admits, that the gift was made to her <italic>causa mortis</italic> &#x2014; R must return the valuables to A, since L&#x2019;s final statement before the witnesses voided all previous <italic>causa mortis</italic> gifts.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. During a riot and massacre A and his wife, L, were killed and their daughter apostatized. A&#x2019;s brother and L&#x2019;s brother have survived them. Who is the rightful heir to A&#x2019;s property?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. An apostate forfeits his rights as an heir, although he has the power to transmit his property to his Jewish heirs. Since it is not known whether A&#x2019;s daughter apostatized after her parents were killed, and thus inherited the property from either parent and upon apostatizing transferred it to A&#x2019;s brother, or that she apostatized before they were killed, her survival does not change the status of the estate. Therefore, the estate should be divided in the following manner: The amount recorded in L&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic> as dowry, shall be divided equally between her brother and A&#x2019;s brother; L&#x2019;s private property, if any, shall go to her brother, while the remaining property shall go to A&#x2019;s brother. However, if A&#x2019;s daughter is still a minor, the estate should not be divided until she reaches majority. Then, if she still persists in her apostasy for one hour, the estate must be divided between the brothers; for a minor does not forfeit her rights as an heir upon apostatizing, since the persuasion of a minor is tantamount to inexorable compulsion.</p>

<h1><bold>687</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A, his four daughters, and his wife, were killed when the house they occupied collapsed. A&#x2019;s heirs claim that perhaps the wife died first and that therefore they now were the only heirs to A&#x2019;s estate. The wife&#x2019;s brothers, on the other hand, claim that perhaps the wife died last and that therefore they were entitled to her <italic>ketubah</italic>. Some Rabbis are of the opinion that the wife&#x2019;s heirs were entitled to one-twelfth of the estate; while other Rabbis, computing probabilities, believe that they were entitled to one thirty-second of the estate.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. It is my humble opinion that the wife&#x2019;s heirs are entitled to one-half of the estate, because of the talmudic principle <italic>Kol Kavua kemahaze al mahaze domi</italic>, meaning: whenever an event is about to befall (or has befallen) one of a number of fixed persons or objects, each person or object has a fifty-fifty chance that the incident will befall (or has befallen) him or it. Therefore, legally, there is a fifty-fifty chance for each one of the six persons involved that he or she died last. Had the daughters been married and had their husbands appeared to demand their share, the estate would have had to be divided into six parts. But, since only two persons demand their share, the estate should be divided between the two. Although a woman has to take an oath before she is entitled to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic>, no such oath is required in this case since A died suddenly and we have no reason to suspect that before his death he had deposited with her valuables to be used in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>.</p>

Subsequently A married and his second wife bore him a daughter. Before his death A sought witnesses to attest to his will that his daughter should inherit part of his estate, but he was overtaken by sudden death. Are we to assume that in the agreement referred to above A intended to give to a daughter the status of a son?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The term &#x201C;sons&#x201D; when used in vows does not include daughters. Moreover, a person who has sons has no right to give his daughter the status of an heir. Therefore, A&#x2019;s daughter is not entitled to the share of an heir in A&#x2019;s estate.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. According to talmudic law, after the death of a person who had children by two wives, the sons of each wife first collect (from the father&#x2019;s estate) the <italic>ketubah</italic> of their mother; whatever is left of the estate is, then, divided among the heirs. Is this collection of a mother&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic>, called <italic>ketubat benin dichrin</italic>, enforced nowadays?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Many <italic>Geonim</italic> are of the opinion that the <italic>ketubat benin dichrin</italic> is not collectible nowadays. But R. Hai Gaon is of the opinion that it is collectible; and I am inclined to decide, in accordance with the opinion of R. Hai, that it is collectible even from movable property, unless a custom exists in a particular community that it is not collectible.</p>
<p>This decision is based on R. Meir&#x2019;s Responsum as recorded in Pr. 248; Am. II, 64, 65; Tesh. Maim. to Nashim 26; and the opinion expressed in Mord. Ket. 162. But Cr. 116 records the following decision: Since a difference of opinion exists between the <italic>Geonim</italic>, the burden of proof [to prove according to which authority the law is to be decided] lies on the person who wants to collect money from the other person.</p>
<p>Tesh. Maim. <italic>ibid</italic>. continues: The <italic>ketubat benin dichrin</italic> is collectible nowadays from both real property and from personal property. As the ordinance of R. Tam, providing that a woman&#x2019;s dowry be returned to her heirs if the woman dies within the first year of marriage, is enforced; surely the ordinance of talmudic scholars, of a similar nature, should be enforced. According to the custom of the communities, the dowry is thus returned to the woman&#x2019;s heirs if she died within two years after her marriage. But R. Meir is of the opinion that the dowry should not be returned to her heirs, but to those who have given it originally. Similarly, R. Meir gave a dowry to his granddaughter Rachel. When she died in the second year of her marriage, R. Meir demanded that the dowry be returned to him although she had other heirs. In some communities only half of the dowry is returned when the woman dies in the second year of her marriage. The ordinance of the communities, which bears the signature of R. David of Merseburg, also has a similar provision.</p>

<p>1) <italic>Q</italic>. May the sons of A&#x2019;s second wife plead that A&#x2019;s first wife, at A&#x2019;s request, has waived her children&#x2019;s right to her <italic>ketubah</italic>? Thus, while a person may not claim to have repaid a debt before it fell due because the presumption is that people generally do not repay a debt before it falls due, no such presumption exists in regard to waiving a right or an obligation.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The claim that an olbigation has been waived in one&#x2019;s favor is weak and is valid only when the legal presumption of <italic>Miggo</italic> exists; as in the case where the person could have successfully denied the very existence of the obligation, or could have claimed to have already discharged such obligation. Therefore, the claim in our case is invalid. Moreover, had A&#x2019;s first wife actually waived such obligation in the presence of witnesses, her act would have been invalid since she had no right directly to waive the monetary rights of her children, while retaining her own rights.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. Since the court does not attend to claims against young orphans except when interest is accumulating on their obligations, or when the widow&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic> is demanded, in which latter case the court attends only because of <italic>hinnah</italic> (in order to enhance happy marriages); and since in our case (where A&#x2019;s sons by his first wife demand the <italic>ketubat benin dichrin</italic>) the element of <italic>hinnah</italic> is absent, must these sons wait (with the collection of their mother&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic>) until A&#x2019;s youngest sons grow up?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A&#x2019;s sons by his first wife do not have to collect the <italic>ketubah</italic> of their mother; for it fell to them as an inheritance and is theirs already. All of A&#x2019;s sons are partners in the estate, which must be divided among them to give each of them his due share. Therefore, if A left money, the sons of his first wife may take their share of the money without the supervision of a court since the dividing of money between heirs needs no such supervision. But, if A&#x2019;s estate consists of real property, the sons of his first wife will have to wait until A&#x2019;s youngest sons grow up, as R. Tam is of the opinion that a court should not attend to the division of such an estate unless the young orphans agree to the division.</p>

<h1><bold>694</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A, a levir, married the widow of his brother B and had children with her. B had died while his father was still alive, but subsequently the father also died. Before his death, however, the latter divided his property equally among his sons. While A was away his remaining three brothers divided the father&#x2019;s landed property into four equal parts, one for each brother. When A returned he did not object to the division; and after his death, when the brothers sold their parts, his widow and orphans did not protest against the sale for over three years. Now, however, the latter claim that the division was unjust and the sale, therefore, invalid since A was entitled to a double portion of the estate, his own and that of his brother B.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Both, the division of the property by the brothers, and its subsequent sale, would be void, according to Rashi, since A was entitled to a double portion out of his father&#x2019;s estate. The fact that both transactions were not protested for over three years, is of no consequence since the brothers, or their successors, do not claim that A officially forewent or sold his rights. Moreover, A died before the three years of undisturbed possession were over, and one cannot claim undisturbed possession as evidence of title to property belonging to young orphans even after they grow up. However, since A&#x2019;s father divided his property among his sons, A is not entitled to any more than what his father gave him; for he received his portion as a gift and not as an inheritance.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. The opinion of the Tosaphot is accepted that a sale by an heir has greater validity than that by a first-born. Since the Talmud rules that the sale by a first-born is valid, the sale by an heir is certainly valid.</p>

He further claims that A&#x2019;s wife has no children yet and, therefore, he, B, cannot give anything to A since in case A&#x2019;s wife dies childless, C&#x2019;s heirs will keep him responsible for the money.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B is under no obligation to A for the following reasons: 1) We believe B&#x2019;s claim that he included the money of his departed daughter in A&#x2019;s dowry, since B could have claimed that his younger daughter gave him her money, and this latter claim would have been irrefutable; 2) the father is the rightful heir of the departed daughter since C&#x2019;s provision for the disposition of his gift in case the daughter die childless is void.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. A claims that he has witnesses who will testify that B took from his (A&#x2019;s) father thirty <italic>marks</italic>. B claims that he returned to A whatever he had taken from his father.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the witnesses will testify that B robbed A&#x2019;s father, A should take an oath that B did not as yet return the money to him, and be entitled to collect the thirty <italic>marks</italic> from B. If, however, B received the money from A&#x2019;s father in a legitimate way, B should take an oath that he had paid all the money he owed to his father, and be free from obligation.</p>

<p>B must return the money to the trustee of the orphans. Though B has paid for the orphans the taxes that were demanded of them in his town, he merely freed them from a nuisance, like the man who drove away a lion from his neighbor&#x2019;s property (B. K. 58a), and he was entitled to no compensation, especially because the orphans never became obligated to pay the tax, since they transacted no business in that town, and since their money was not there. Regarding the four <italic>marks</italic>, however, that B paid in order that the orphans be taken to France, it is a well known fact that two <italic>marks</italic> are required of each person before he is accepted.

<p><italic>A</italic>. The trustees must carefully consider A&#x2019;s last words. If he told them to take good care of the money for B because it belonged to B, and that they do nothing therewith except with the consent of B&#x2019;s mother, he probably meant that they serve as trustees together with B&#x2019;s mother till B grow up, but he did not mean that the mother be a trustee indefinitely. Therefore, as soon as B grows up, the trustees and the mother will have to withdraw from the estate. Moreover, if B&#x2019;s mother displayed any intentions of retaining some of the money for herself, her trusteeship should be terminated immediately, for even a trustee appointed by the father of the orphans is to be dismissed as soon as it is discovered that he damages the interests of the orphans.</p>

<h1><bold>710</bold></h1>
<p>I greatly disapprove of Rabbi Samuel&#x2019;s efforts to find excuses and subterfuges in order to free himself from obligation. Nor is it easy for me to pass judgment against my teacher Rabbi Shemariah. In order that it might not be said, however, that the Rabbis are partial to one another, and because we have been commanded to pursue justice and shun fraud, I must express my opinion that Rabbi Shemariah ought to pay such an amount as Joshua will state under oath was the value of the articles and moneys found in his box, provided such articles and moneys are usually placed in a box of this kind. Rabbi Shemariah is considered a bailee who turned over valuables deposited with him to another bailee and thereupon became fully responsible for the deposit, for he had no right to turn over the box to the servants of the worthy R. Eleazar. He certainly had no right to instruct these servants to break open the box. Although he intended thereby to save the valuables contained in the box, he was not justified in breaking the box since he could have ordered that the locked box be carried out intact, for its bulk was not greater than that of the other objects and large books that were carried out. Moreover, he should have appointed a member of his household or one of his students to watch the box, and thus would not have been guilty of turning over the deposit to another bailee. Even when the box was carried into the yard of the Christian priest, Rabbi Shemariah should have placed a guard over it there. Although Rabbi Shemariah guarded the box in the same manner as he guarded his own valuables, he is not to be excused, since he had no right to leave highly desirable valuables unguarded. Money deposited with a person must be guarded very carefully, and merely keeping it in the same place where one keeps one&#x2019;s own valuables is not sufficient, unless such a place is reasonably secure. You are acquainted with the servants of R. Eleazar and should be able to judge whether leaving the valuables in their care is to be considered willful neglect or not. Moreover, Rabbi Shemariah had no right to break open the box and then leave it unguarded, for an open box invites thieves; especially so since he took the box to a place that was swarming with thieves and robbers. We cannot free him from obligation on the ground that the box was in imminent danger of being lost in any event (it was a matter of common knowledge that the bishop was intent on seizing it) since the box could have been saved with little trouble had it not been broken open, and had he placed a guard to watch it in the same manner as one watched the silver and the gold. In short, Rabbi Shemariah, must take an oath to the effect that Joshua&#x2019;s valuables are not in his possession, before paying for them. Let him comply with the requirements of the law, write off his loss as a bad investment, and the Lord will fully compensate him for it.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. If A and B were partners, and A was engaged in managing some of the partnership money, even if the horse was lost through B&#x2019;s willful neglect, B would be free from obligation since the horse would thus have been lost &#x201C;in the presence of its owner.&#x201D; Your letter indicates that A and B were partners. Nevertheless, if A suspects that B misappropriated the horse, he may demand that B deny such charge under oath. In general, A may demand at any time that B take the &#x201C;partner&#x2019;s oath&#x201D;, and B may impose the same oath on A. However, if A and B are not partners, B must merely take an oath either to the effect that he did not take a horse from A, or that he does not recall having taken a horse from A, and be free from obligation.</p>

B avers that he kept the money in a good hiding place in his room, in the same place where he usually kept his own money, but that it was taken from him by force.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If B will take an oath in support of his claim, he will be free from obligation, unless he admits having used the money. In the latter case he would be responsible for the loss of the money no matter under what circumstances it was lost. If B, however, did not use A&#x2019;s money for his own benefit, his manner of guarding it was sufficient. Although the only safe place in which to keep money is in the ground &#x2014; money being unidentifiable, more thieves are after it, and they take greater chances in stealing it than any other valuables &#x2014; B was not required to keep A&#x2019;s money in the ground, since it was not given to him for safekeeping, for he expected to hand it over to A any day upon demand.</p>

Keeping another person&#x2019;s money in the same place one keeps one&#x2019;s own, is not sufficient, for, a person may be careless with his own money, but he has no right to be careless with that of another. However, if B was expected to return the money immediately after the meal, then he was not supposed to bury it in the ground for the short time he was to keep it. Therefore, B must take an oath that he was to return the money after the meal, that he kept the money in the same place he kept his own, and that he was not unduly careless in handling it &#x2014; and he would then be free from obligation.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. A is to be held responsible for all articles that, according to B&#x2019;s assertion under oath, are missing from the strongbox, provided such articles are usually kept in a strongbox of this type, for the ordinance for the benefit of the robbed person [that the latter take an oath as to the extent of the damage he has suffered, and collect full compensation therefor], applies also to other, similar, damagees.

B averred that A&#x2019;s wife, before her marriage to A, had deposited these jewels with him in order to withhold them from A and keep them for the children by her former marriage. Now that she had died, B wished to do her bidding and deliver the jewels to her children. We, therefore, decided that B take an oath as to the truth of his statement and deliver the jewels to the heirs of A&#x2019;s wife. Next day, however, when B was to take the oath, he declared that he had been reminded, by his wife, of the truth of A&#x2019;s claim, and that he was ready to take an oath to the effect that A deposited the jewels with him. The heirs of A&#x2019;s wife, however, who were present at the trial on the previous day, claimed that B had, then, admitted having in his possession jewels that belonged to them. They, therefore, demanded these jewels.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If B takes an oath to the effect that A deposited the jewels with him, and returns them to A, he will be free from obligation to the woman&#x2019;s heirs. We must be satisfied with such an oath since B had recourse to a <italic>Miggo</italic> (an alternative claim) that would only have imposed a different oath on him; for B could have claimed that he had returned the jewels to the heirs, or that the jewels had been stolen or lost, after the court had reached the above decision. Such claims by B would only have obligated him to take an oath. Although we usually do not accept a defendant&#x2019;s claim to have been mistaken in his original admission, even when such defendant had recourse to a <italic>Miggo</italic>, this case is different, since B is not a litigant and is to gain nothing from either alternative.</p>

Are we to believe a trustee who was appointed by the two opposing parties regarding the terms of his trusteeship, or may we require him to take an oath? Moreover, Leah is a married woman. May her husband object to her being degraded by imposing an oath on her?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A trustee appointed by both parties is not required to take an oath regarding the terms of his trusteeship. But, Leah was not appointed trustee by both parties. She was only appointed by the husband, and, therefore, is required to take an oath. Leah&#x2019;s husband cannot object to imposing an oath on her. If the law requires that a woman take an oath, the husband has no right to protest against her being degraded in court. But, since Leah, as long as she is married, has no money of her own, and were she to claim that she had already returned the deposit, no oath would be imposed on her, we now lend credence to her words and require no oath. However, the court should give A a writ stating that after Leah will be divorced or widowed she will have to return the money to A or take an oath to the effect that A deposited the money with her on condition that she return it upon his wife&#x2019;s consent only.</p>

The fact that B is responsible for A&#x2019;s deposit and would have to compensate him for its loss, does not make B the owner of the deposited money.

R. Meir, however, pointed out that C also committed a sin in seizing the property of another, for the talmudic dictum &#x201C;a person may execute judgment on his own behalf&#x201D; merely means that a person may retrieve his own valuables which he finds in the hands of others; but a creditor is not permitted to seize the valuables of his debtor without a court order.</p>

Thus, if A admits that the books belong to B, C must allow the latter to redeem them. But if A denies B&#x2019;s claim, or if A is out of town, C owes nothing to B.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. If it has been proved that A owes money to C, and if B admits, or is not in a position to deny, that A&#x2019;s valuables are in his possession, C is entitled to collect these valuables because of the lien of R. Nathan. Moreover, if A is a violent and insubordinate man (who refuses to subordinate himself to the ruling of the court), B would do a meritorious act in seizing A&#x2019;s valuables for C&#x2019;s benefit and thus save the court a great deal of trouble.</p>

Are we to presume that a deputy generally carries out his commission, and that A therefore may claim to be positive that his valuables had been delivered to B, thus obligating the latter to take an oath in support of his denial?</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. B is to be held responsible for A&#x2019;s valuables, for, the fact that A trusted C to be his deputy in delivering the valuables to B, does not mean that he trusted C as a depositee for an extended period of time. Therefore, B had no right to redeposit A&#x2019;s valuables with C.</p>

He told B, however, that should C have any claims against him on account of the eviction of B, he, A, would answer these charges in court. B, however, claimed: that C rented the house from A on condition that he (C) lease it to whomever he wants; that he, B, was willing to partition off the part of the house he occupies from the rest of the house; and that he would guarantee to pay the widow for any damages she may sustain as a result of his remaining on the premises. A, however, claimed that he feared that grave damages to the widow will result if B stays, and that the widow cannot dwell in one house with a snake (meaning B).</p>

When the time came for A to pay the rent for both houses to the Gentile, B refused to pay his share. A, therefore, demanded that B move out. B refused to do so, claiming that he rented the house for three years. A, however, claimed that he rented the house for one year only. An arbitrator decided that the rental period be set at two years. After B lived in A&#x2019;s house for sixteen months, he moved out leaving some of his furniture till the end of the second year. A, therefore, demands rent for two years.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A is entitled to the entire rent for two years. A would be entitled to such rent even though B had not left some of his furniture till the end of the second year; for, B failed to give sufficient notice to A, which notice would have enabled A to find another tenant for his house.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A and his son-in-law B were partners in a house. A leased his half to B for an indefinite period till the latter&#x2019;s death, at a fixed annual rental. Subsequently, A wanted to sell his part, but B objected. The case was brought before R. Meir who sustained B&#x2019;s objection. Now B is seeking to sell his half and also his right to a fixed rental for the other half. A, however, objects to a sale by B of the right to a fixed rental claiming that he had originally leased his half to B for a low rental in order that B and his family live therein and enjoy it themselves, but not for the purpose of selling it to another. Is A&#x2019;s objection valid? Also, please note that A&#x2019;s daughter, B&#x2019;s wife, was dead, but the children she bore to A are living; does the fact that B&#x2019;s wife is dead prejudice B&#x2019;s rights? Moreover, B claims, and witnesses support his claim, that the agreement of lease was reached between A and B after a sharp quarrel which followed their buying of the property. Thus the lease was not a gift of love [in which case the purpose of the gift must be taken into consideration], but was rather the outcome of litigation and compromise and was, therefore, of the nature of a sale. B further states that should A&#x2019;s objection be sustained in court, he would sell his own half of the house and would dwell in the other half, or would rent out the latter half and would use the rent for his sustenance. Please further inform me, on the other side of this sheet, as to what was done in the case of the widow from Spiers and her two Levite levirs. Signed: Asher b. Rabbi Yehiel.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. We are not to take into consideration A&#x2019;s purpose in leasing his half of the house to B, for various reasons. a) When B sells his right to a fixed rental to a third party, he benefits from such sale as much as he would have benefited from living in the house himself. b) Since B has lived in the rented half of the house for a long time, the transaction of the lease is by now complete so that A&#x2019;s original purpose in leasing it is no longer of any consequence. c) A transaction of sale, lease, or even gift, is concluded by two parties, being the result of a meeting of both minds and, therefore, such transaction is not conditioned by the special purpose or intent of one party when such purpose or intent was not in the mind of the other party. Therefore, even if B had no surviving children from A&#x2019;s daughter, the validity of the lease would not have been affected. d) According to your letter, the lease was not motivated by feelings of kindliness, but was a purely business transaction. R. Meir adds: Regarding the widow mentioned above, I shall order that my Responsum pertaining thereto be copied for your benefit.</p>

<h1><bold>734</bold></h1>
<p>Your reasoning and the fine distinctions you draw are correct, but they apply only to a case where the person who is seeking to sell the house that he has rented to another, is not forced to sell the house by dire necessity. When a person is thus forced to sell his house, we assume that originally when he rented the house to his tenant he did not intend to let it remain rented while he was dying from hunger. Therefore, if the landlord take an oath to the effect that he is forced by dire necessity to sell his house, his tenant will have to vacate the house. If the tenant has paid his rent in advance for a certain period, however, he may not be forced to vacate before the expiration of that term, since renting is a form of buying limited to the period for which the rent is paid. In our case, the tenant may not claim that his landlord is not in desperate need of money since he owns real estate on which his wife&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic> is a lien, and he could sell to another the right to take title to such real estate in case his wife die before him, for we assume that at the time the landlord rented his house to the tenant he did not intend that the renting should cause him to jeopardize his property in such a manner.</p>

She now demands that A remove his building and that he pay her rent for the time the building stood on her premises. A claims that he rented the space for his building, for ten years (at an annual rental of ten denarii, one-half pound<xref rid="fn13">&#x002A;</xref>), from the widow&#x2019;s son and son-in-law; that the latter two informed the widow of the transaction, and that the widow sent them her written consent thereto.

<p><italic>A</italic>. Even A&#x2019;s producing a written consent from the widow would be of no avail unless he can also prove through witnesses that the widow instructed and ordered the writing of the instrument. Should he not be able to do so, he will have to remove the building from the widow&#x2019;s premises and pay her rent for the time his building stood thereon. Should A produce such witnesses, his contract with the widow&#x2019;s son and son-in-law will be non-voidable even though A did not yet pay the rent for the full ten years. Although the widow did not personally instruct her son and son-in-law to rent her premises to A, but sent such instructions in writing &#x2014; such manner of sending instructions not being acceptable in talmudic law &#x2014; nevertheless the son and son-in-law became the widow&#x2019;s agents, since it is the usual custom of merchants to accept as valid written instruments, and since the custom of merchants prevails in business transactions.</p>

Moreover, A should receive a court decision entitling him to collect from B&#x2019;s wife, should she become widowed or divorced, an amount equal to the value of the key. A clause should be included in the decision providing that in case of a dispute between A and B&#x2019;s wife regarding the value of the key, it will be incumbent upon her to take an oath as to the value of the key.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A claims that certain commentaries to the tractate <italic>Yebamot</italic> were once lent to B&#x2019;s father, to A&#x2019;s brother, and to himself; that when these commetaries were lost (or stolen) the three borrowers were required to compensate the lender to the extent of one pound; that his brother and he, A, paid two thirds of this compensation; that after B&#x2019;s father died, B found (or recovered) the commentaries; and that in A&#x2019;s presence, B evaluated them at one pound upon delivering them to his creditor. A, therefore, demands from B two thirds of a pound, for his brother and himself. B avers that he has no knowledge of A&#x2019;s having paid anything for the commentaries; that he received them as part of his father&#x2019;s estate; that he was answerable for only half of their value since he shared the estate with his brother; that he kept them for a period of three years without any protest on A&#x2019;s part; and that even if he were forced by the court to pay A for his alleged share in the commentaries, he would pay such share of their present, depreciated, value only. A rejoins that he holds B responsible for the entire sum, since he found the commentaries in B&#x2019;s possession; and that he learned only recently that they were in B&#x2019;s possession. B further claims that in order to retrieve the commentaries he paid (the thief) more than their actual value; and that he gave them to his creditor in A&#x2019;s presence without any protest on A&#x2019;s part. A avers that he has no knowledge of B&#x2019;s having paid anything for the commentaries; that B should not have paid anything for them, since they would have been returned at no cost, and that the reason for his failing to protest against B&#x2019;s delivering them to his creditor, was that he sought to discover at what price B would evaluate them. Signed: Nethanel b. Nahman, Ephraim b. Ephraim.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A claims that B knows that A and his brother paid two thirds of a pound when the commentaries were lost, B must take an oath denying such knowledge and be free from obligation. But, if A is not positive in his claim, B is not required to take an oath. A general ban should be pronounced against anyone (including B) who knows anything about this matter and does not report it to the court. If, however, B admits A&#x2019;s claim, but claims to have spent money in retrieving the commentaries, he is entitled to a refund of his expenses. If, however, he paid such money to the thief himself, he is entitled to no refund. Thus, one who buys a stolen object from a person known to be a thief is not entitled to a refund of expenses; he who buys an object from a thief knowing definitely it to be a stolen object, is surely not entitled to a refund. A did not lose his rights by failing to protest against B&#x2019;s delivering the commentaries to his creditor; and he is entitled to receive his share of the amount they were evaluated at, when so delivered.</p>

B, in turn, demanded from A the book of the order <italic>Moed</italic> which he gave to A as security, and which was worth twice as much as A&#x2019;s book. At first A denied that he received B&#x2019;s book, but when confronted by a witness who supported B&#x2019;s claim, A retracted his denial, but alleged: 1) that B loaned him the book with the understanding that his (A&#x2019;s) children should be permitted to study therefrom; 2) that he loaned the book to his son-in-law; and 3) that the book was subsequently burned in the latter&#x2019;s house, and that hence the loss of the book was an unavoidable accident. B denied that he gave A permission to allow his sons to use the book.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since A and B lent books to each other, their responsibilities regarding these books were those of hired watchmen who are not responsible for unavoidable accidents. The question revolves, then, about A&#x2019;s lending the book to his son-in-law. Therefore, upon A&#x2019;s taking an oath that B gave him permission to allow his sons to use B&#x2019;s book, A will be free from any obligation to B. B, on the other hand, may retain A&#x2019;s book, upon taking an oath that he did not permit A to give his book to A&#x2019;s sons for study, and B is further entitled to collect from A&#x2019;s son-in-law (the difference between the value of the lost book and the one B retained) since the responsibility of the son-in-law regarding the book was that of a borrower who is responsible even for unavoidable accidents. If, however, A&#x2019;s son-in-law is willing to take an oath that he did not borrow B&#x2019;s book from A, he will be free from obligation to B, and his oath will not subject his father-in-law to any further obligation.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A says that without his knowledge or consent B took a book from his house. B admits having taken the book, but claims to have done so because A had once borrowed a book from him, that was later stolen from A&#x2019;s house, but A had refused to pay him for it or even to go to court with him. A avers that at the time he borrowed B&#x2019;s book, he told B to call for it and take it from his garret and that he was not to be held responsible for it. B denies A&#x2019;s allegation. The judges called B&#x2019;s attention to the fact that he violated the ordinace of the communities against &#x201C;retention&#x201D; (cf. Finkelstein op. cit. p. 133). Thereupon B returned the book to A, excusing himself that he did not seize the book in payment of the money due him, but merely wanted to force A to go to court with him.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B did not transgress the ordinance of the communities against &#x201C;retention&#x201D;, for this ordinance applies only to those who have borrowed, or received as deposits, valuables from other persons and later sought to retain them because of a claim against their owners. Seizure because of a claim, however, was not included in the ordinance of the communities. Moreover, when borrowed or deposited valuables are returned to their owners because of the aforesaid ordinance, the borrower or bailee does not thereby lose the legal advantage that goes with possession of the litigated money. Therefore, if witnesses did not see A&#x2019;s book in B&#x2019;s possession, B had recourse to <italic>Miggo</italic> (he could have claimed to have returned A&#x2019;s book) and we now believe B&#x2019;s statement under oath, up to the value of A&#x2019;s book. Although B admits that he did not seize A&#x2019;s book in payment of the money due him, but merely sought thereby to force A to go to court with him, nevertheless B is considered to be in possession of the litigated money. However if witnesses saw A&#x2019;s book in B&#x2019;s possession before the trial, B had no recourse to <italic>Miggo</italic>, and his possession of A&#x2019;s book was of no legal consequence.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. After the period, for which A borrowed the book, had passed, A&#x2019;s responsibility for the book became that of a hired watchman.

A now declares himself ready to be examined, but B argues that A&#x2019;s present knowledge is no proof of his previous fitness for his position. Moreover, one witness testifies that at the time A undertook to teach B&#x2019;s son, he was not qualified to do so because of insufficient knowledge.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A has now sufficient knowledge to teach B&#x2019;s son, the burden of proof lies on B that A did not have such knowledge at the time he was engaged. However, since B has one witness to support his claim, A must take an oath to the effect that he had sufficient knowledge at the time of the agreement. If A takes such oath, he will be entitled to collect his full wages from B.</p>

Solomon, of France: The tutor must be paid in full; for a tutor is in a similar position as the public workers of Mahoza who are reported to become weakened by lack of work (B. M. 77a). However, the following distinction should be made: If A&#x2019;s son was a sickly child, and A failed to warn the tutor about it, the tutor should get his full pay; but if the boy was usually healthy, the tutor should not be paid for the period of his pupil&#x2019;s illness.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. The law provides that when a tutor is prevented from carrying on his duties by his own illness, he is entitled to his pay; but if he is so prevented by the pupil&#x2019;s illness, he is not entitled to his pay, unless the pupil is a sickly child. Since a child is usually healthy, the burden lies with the tutor of stipulating at the time of the agreement that he is to receive his pay in the event the child is sick.</p>

Since the tutor had to continue to teach B&#x2019;s son, he demanded that A pay him for the remaining term (or terms). A, however, claimed that when the tutor came to console him, after his son&#x2019;s death, he told him that he forwent the balance of his fee and that he would even repay him whatever he had received in excess of the fee for five weeks. A, therefore, demanded that amount from the tutor. At first the tutor admitted that he had forgone the balance of his fee, but claimed that his act was not valid since it was merely a verbal statement without a formal act of transference. Later, however, he completely denied ever having relinquished his claim.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the tutor definitely admitted A&#x2019;s claim, and later retracted his admission, A is free from obligation to the tutor. However, he cannot collect anything he has already paid, since the tutor&#x2019;s promise of a refund was not accompanied by a formal act of transference. But, if the tutor&#x2019;s denial followed immediately upon his admission, or if the denial merely explained that the admission was really no admission, or if the admission was only implied but not definitely stated, A must pay the tutor his fee for the whole year.

However, even the professional matchmaker is not entitled to his full fee unless it be almost certain that he could have earned the same amount from another match. Thus, the case came before me of a matchmaker whom a man promised a sum of money upon successfully concluding a match between himself and a certain woman. After the match was concluded and the man paid the promised sum to the matchmaker, the latter demanded a particular sum from the woman, claiming that she had also promised to pay him a fee. The woman denied his claim. I freed the woman from obligation for the following reason: Even if the woman promised a fee to the matchmaker he would not be entitled to collect it since he occupied himself with this match because of the money promised to him by her husband. The woman&#x2019;s promise of a fee to the matchmaker and the effort he spent as a consequence thereof, did not deprive him of any income, since his time had to be spent anyway on consummating this match.</p>

Since heirs are not required to pay a father&#x2019;s fine, B&#x2019;s children are free from any obligation to A. Moreover, the court should claim for B&#x2019;s heirs that had B been summoned to court before his death, he would have claimed that he had already made good A&#x2019;s losses.</p>

The Gentile court released B from all obligation. B, however, angered at A&#x2019;s act, turned informer against him and was responsible for his losing some money. When the matter came before us, we decided that B must compensate A for the damage he caused him. However, some people believe that B ought to be free from obligation since he acted while in the heat of anger. They state that a <italic>takkanah</italic> of the communities frees from obligation a person who in the heat of anger against a friend turned informer, retaliates by informing against him. Is our decision correct? Signed: R. Isaac and his court.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Your decision is correct. Although A committed a wrong by summoning B to a Gentile court &#x2014; it is true that A only wanted to force B to abide by the ruling of a Jewish court, but he had no right to do so through the intervention of a Gentile court without the consent of the community or of the foremost authorities of the land &#x2014; and ought to be flogged or be fined, the amount of the fine to be determined by the Rabbis of this country, nevertheless B had no right to inform against A and, therefore, must compensate him for his loss. It is true that we deal harshly with an informer, that we are even permitted to kill him, and that A committed the first wrong by turning informer against his friend B.<xref rid="fn14">&#x002A;</xref> But, a person is in the status of an informer while he threatens, or is on his way, to inform against his fellow, and not after he has already done so; for, while a person is on his way to inform against his friend, the amount of damage he might cause by his act is unlimited; since after a Jew is delivered into the hands of Gentiles they bring false accusations upon him until his very life is in danger. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, we are permitted to damage, maim, and even kill, the informer in order to prevent him from carrying out his evil intentions. But after the informer has completed his work, the extent of the damage is known. While the informer is obliged to pay for the damage he has caused and may be punished or fined for his crime, we are not permitted to damage indiscriminately his property, his interests, or his person. The <italic>takkanah</italic> of the communities referred to, probably frees a person who informs (against an informer) in the heat of anger from the special fines which communities usually impose upon those who violate public policy, but does not free him from responsibility for the actual damage he has caused by his act.</p>

The Jews, B, C, D, and E, who were summoned to testify under oath as to A&#x2019;s identity, were threatened with confiscation of their property, if they refused to tell the truth. They, therefore, admitted that A was a convert, and avoided the taking of a false oath. Luckily, A escaped being burned at the stake (which is the fate of converts to Judaism whenever they are detected) and suffered only a financial loss. Now A demands that B, C, D, and E make good the loss that befell him owing to their testimony.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B, C, D, and E must repay A for his losses sustained because of their testimony. Their testimony involved A&#x2019;s life, and their duty was to disregard the possible monetary loss to themselves and save A&#x2019;s life, even though it would involve the taking of an apparently false oath. Under duress one is permitted to swear to a statement which is apparently false and, then, modify that statement in one&#x2019;s thoughts so that it is no longer false; or one may completely nullify the false oath by a whispered statement. Many Jews resort to this practice whenever they are forced by their overlords to take an oath that they will not move out of the overlord&#x2019;s town.</p>

<p>R. Meir further decided that when a Gentile chooses two Jewish witnesses in his litigation with a Jew, and the latter agrees to admit in evidence the testimony of these two (in the court of the land), they may testify on the Gentile&#x2019;s behalf, even though the (other) Jews protest against such action.

<p><italic>A</italic>. A should clarify his use of the term &#x201C;loss&#x201D;. If he means thereby that he was forced to repay the money he owed to his creditors, this cannot be termed a loss, for, although B should not have warned the Gentiles, since he was under no obligation to do so, A was under obligation to repay his debts to the Gentiles. Had he successfully evaded payment, he would have committed a sin. Therefore, B is free from obligation. But, if the Gentile creditors, upon learning of A&#x2019;s intention to abscond with their money, trumped up charges against him so that he was forced to pay more than what he owed them, and if A is positive that B informed the Gentiles, B must take an oath in the synagogue denying A&#x2019;s charge. If the Gentiles report that B informed them, B must take the oath in the presence of the Gentiles. But, if subsequently to his conflict with his creditors A gave B a writ of remission, B is now free from obligation since such writ includes all claims.</p>

An opinion is prevalent among the people that a <italic>takkanah</italic> of the communities frees one from any responsibility, if, after suffering bodily injury at the hand of his neighbor, and while still in the heat of anger, he retaliates with force, or even turns informer against him. If such <italic>takkanah</italic> exists, in order to punish severely the person who began the disturbance, or if B&#x2019;s claim is true that A released him from obligation in this matter, B owes nothing to A. But the <italic>takkanah</italic> of the communities probably frees the assaulted person, who retaliates in the heat of anger, from the special fines which communities usually impose upon offenders against public policy, but does not free him from responsibility for the injuries he inflicted upon the assailant. The judges, therefore, must evaluate the five compensations (prescribed to the injured person by the Talmud) for biting B&#x2019;s finger. If B caused A a greater loss than the amount estimated, the former must pay the difference to the latter.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. The father of A provoked a quarrel with B who vigorously defended himself and made the nose of his assailant bleed. A became infuriated upon seeing his father&#x2019;s blood and informed against B causing him a loss of money. Some are of the opinion that A should be freed from any obligation to B since he acted out of love and respect for his father. R. Samuel was supposed to be a judge in this case. But some are trying to disqualify R. Samuel for the reason that he is host, or landlord, to one of the litigants.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A must make good the loss he caused B, for A had no right to inform against B regardless of what B did to A&#x2019;s father. R. Samuel is permitted to act as judge in the case; for the Talmud does not include the landlord of one of the litigants among those who are disqualified to act as judges.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A struck B who became highly incensed and informed against A so that he sustained damages. Some persons maintain that B is free from obligation since he acted in the heat of righteous anger, and that this is in accordance with the custom of the communities.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The logic of those who maintain that B is free from obligation, is faulty. If a person should strike another and inflict very slight injury upon him and the victim would retaliate by informing against the aggressor and cause him a loss of a thousand <italic>marks</italic>, would anyone hold the informer guitless? Indeed not; but we must estimate the damage caused by the aggressor and that caused by the informer, and make the one who caused the greater damage pay the difference to the other. In actual cases I always render decisions in accordance with this rule.</p>

<h1><bold>778</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. D invited A and his household to a meal. A&#x2019;s household included his servant and prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9; N. During the meal a quarrel broke out between D and A and the latter&#x2019;s men belabored D. Whereupon D went to the magistrate and lodged a complaint against A and the members of A&#x2019;s household. The magistrate, however, was told that A was not at fault, but that the full blame was upon A&#x2019;s household. Consequently, the magistrate, who owed A six pounds, dismissed A with a mere warning that he would hold A responsible for the misdeeds of the members of his household, and would expect A to make amends therefor. D and his relative, B, however, later returned to the magistrate and placed the blame squarely on A&#x2019;s shoulders. Thereupon, the magistrate brought false charges against A, and, as a result, A was forced to cancel the magistrate&#x2019;s debt. The fact that D and B lodged complaints with the magistrate is attested to by witnesses. A, therefore, demands that B refund him the six pounds he thus lost through B&#x2019;s informing against him. B contends that one, C, too has informed against A, and that a Gentile witness would bear out this contention.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If it is known that D had complained to the magistrate before B informed against A, even though at that time the magistrate dismissed A with a mild warning, B is free from obligation, for the extent of the damage D had done to A, cannot be ascertained. The possibilities are that the magistrate would already have found cause to cancel his debt to A. However, if D had not lodged his complaint with the magistrate before he was accompanied by B, the latter would be responsible for half the damage. Even if D is poor and thus unable to pay his share, B is responsible for only half the damage. If in your community, however, D is not to be held responsible for his deed &#x2014; for he was hurt and sorely grieved, and &#x201C;a man is not taken to account for what he does in his distress (B.B. 16b)&#x201D; &#x2014; B is to be held responsible for the full damage. The damage, however, is not the face value of the loan by A to the magistrate, for some loans, improperly secured, are worth much less than the amount originally lent. Therefore, we must ascertain the actual value of the above loan before we can determine the extent of the damage done by B. However, if the actual value of the loan is not ascertainable, but witnesses have heard the magistrate admit that he owed six pounds to A, the latter should state under oath to what extent his interests were damaged by B, and collect such amount from B. Although this procedure is irregular &#x2014; the ordinance introduced against a robber, does not apply to an informer (B. K. 62a) &#x2014; it was accepted for the sake of social order, since the amount of damage caused by an informer could never have been proven by unimpeachable evidence. B&#x2019;s contention regarding C&#x2019;s interference is of no consequence, since the damage was done by the time C appeared before the magistrate.</p>

<h1><bold>779</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A young man, A, the son of a wealthy man became impoverished. He sought, however, to gain power and influence in community affairs by slander and sycophancy. After the new king [Pedro III] ascended the throne, A increased his nefarious activities. In spite of warnings and threats he refused to abandon his criminal career. When [the leaders of] the communities of the three kingdoms, Catalonia, Valencia, and Aragon, were summoned before the king, they were truly convinced that A had lodged information against them. They begged him to desist at least on this occasion, and though at first he agreed to do so, he came running after them and stubbornly insisted on accompanying them [on their way to the king]. The deputies of the communities realizing that A was an &#x201C;assailant&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05E3;</span>), took council with the noble brothers, Joseph and Moses Abrabalia who held high office at the Royal Court and together they told the king of A&#x2019;s criminal activities and expressed their opinion that he was deserving of death. The king, who loved justice, arrested A and put him in chains. A royal judge took the depositions of the advocates and representatives of the communities. Yet, I remained aloof from the whole affair until several communities, together with A&#x2019;s relatives, demanded that a royal mandate be obtained empowering the aged Rabbi Jonah of Girona, the nephew of Rabbi Jonah Gerundi, and myself to become the judges in this case. I refused to become involved in this affair and mete out strict justice, unless I could effect an amicable arrangement of the matter. I warned A&#x2019;s relatives not to apply for a royal mandate, for I wanted to act as conciliator rather than judge. They, however, rejected my plan, and without my knowledge obtained the royal mandate. It seems, therefore, that A&#x2019;s relatives themselves, because he had caused them a great deal of suffering, were anxious that he be put to death. Finally the king summoned Rabbi Jonah (and myself) and commanded us to gather the evidence. The king ordered the communities to pronounce the ban against anyone knowing anything about this matter who did not report it to the Jewish court of his town; he further ordered the courts to send the depositions thus taken to Rabbi Jonah and to myself, and that we in turn report our findings to him or to his appointed judge. We procrastinated and delayed for a whole year in an effort to bring about an amicable settlement with the communities, but our efforts met with no success, since the communities feared that A would bring misfortune upon them. We even asked the king for an audience, but were refused. The delay in the proceedings incensed the king and he ordered us sent to him in chains &#x2014; the king was then in a distant part of his kingdom &#x2014; if we did not announce our decision. A&#x2019;s brother also constantly urged us to comply with the king&#x2019;s demand and announce our decision, for it was better that A alone be executed rather than have the whole family die with him. After much labor and great suffering we were forced to give our opinion to the king that according to his [the king&#x2019;s?] own statement and the testimony gathered by the various Jewish courts, A was deserving of death. I am appending herewith the depositions of the various witnesses who testified at the Jewish courts in the presence of A&#x2019;s representatives and in the presence of the deputies of the various communities. The king, then, sent our opinion to the royal judge in order that he pass judgment on A in accordance with it. A, however, claimed to possess further evidence of his innocence. The royal judge permitted him to argue his case before the representatives of the various communities, and thereupon we withdrew from the case. Meanwhile, the royal judge died. A short time afterwards, however, the king sent his officer to execute A. He was taken to the square in front of the Jewish burial-ground in Barcelona, where the veins of his two arms were opened, and he bled to death. Three years have since elapsed. The noble <italic>parnas</italic> R. Joseph Abrabalia, the representative of his people at the Royal Court, meanwhile passed away. One of A&#x2019;s brothers, however, thinking that the communities would now find no protector nor advocate of their interests at Court, rose in his brother&#x2019;s place and complained before the king&#x2019;s judges that we had erred in our decision since according to Jewish law we had no right to pronounce the death sentence against anyone. He contended that the Jews had forfeited this right long ago according to their own law; that at the time they still excercised that right, only a court of twenty-three judges had the right to pronounce the death sentence, and such a court had to order the witnesses to testify in the presence of the accused. Indeed, this accuser was silenced. But in order that no other advocate for A&#x2019;s family may appear to press charges before the king&#x2019;s judges, I shall set forth the reasons that prompted us to give the opinion mentioned above to the king.</p>
<p>a) A was a &#x201C;pursuer&#x201D; with criminal intentions, and such a &#x201C;pursuer&#x201D; might be put to death summarily without a court trial. This law holds true today and is applicable even outside of the Holy Land.</p>
<p>b) An informer whose nefarious activities are &#x201C;well known&#x201D; may be put to death even after his work has been accomplished, and putting him to death, even without a trial, is considered a praiseworthy act. The term &#x201C;well known&#x201D; in such cases, is used to describe a fact when many persons are aware it is true, although proof has not been established before a court of twenty-three ordained judges. Thus our great scholars who compiled codes repeat the law that a person whose activity as an informer is &#x201C;well known&#x201D; should be put to death summarily, and that no mercy be shown him even in our times. If the term &#x201C;well known&#x201D; would mean &#x201C;a truth established before a court of twenty-three ordained judges&#x201D;, it would have been meaningless when referring to the present age since we have no ordained judges, and the phrase could not thus be used by the codifiers.</p>
<p>c) The custom of summarily putting to death any &#x201C;well-known&#x201D; informer is firmly established in many countries of the diaspora. Maimonides testified to the fact that this custom was accepted throughout the cities of the west. It is daily practiced in Castile and originally became accepted in that country by the advice of great talmudic authorities. In the kingdom of Aragon, and in the previous generation and even in our own time in Catalonia itself, informers were put to death. Were we uncertain regarding the talmudic law governing such cases, we would be justified in putting informers to death because of the custom of the country.</p>
<p>d) A court may put a person to death as an emergency measure even when he is not deserving of death according to talmudic law. The danger involved in permitting sycophants to go unpunished is well known.</p>
<p>e) Even in criminal cases a court may admit into evidence testimony of witnesses in the absence of the accused. This may be done whenever it is impossible to have the witnesses face the accused.</p>
<p>f) Many of the witnesses testified in the presence of A&#x2019;s advocates, which should be equivalent to testifying in A&#x2019;s presence, since in legal matters a person&#x2019;s deputy takes the place of the person himself.</p>
<p>You, our Rabbis, should silence all those who cast aspersions upon our action in the aforementioned matter. You are not on trial yourselves, and therefore your opinion will carry weight and no one will dare oppose it. Signed: Solomon b. Adret.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Your decision is correct. A person who turned informer against his neighbor, and repeated this nefarious practice on three different occasions, according to the testimony of witnesses, should be put to death, and he who hastened to execute him is to be commended. Although Maimonides ruled that we might not put an informer to death after he has already committed his nefarious deed, this law applies to a person who turned informer only on a single occasion. A habitual informer, however, one who repeated his criminal practice on three different occasions, should unquestionably be put to death even after the criminal deed was committed. Your words, therefore, are correct in every respect.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. It is doubtful whether B caused A a loss of money, since A may find another borrower for his money as soon as he receives it from the Gentile. Even if B definitely caused A a loss of money, he did so indirectly; therefore, B is under no obligation to A.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A thief came to A&#x2019;s house and sold him some gold. A, then, passed B&#x2019;s house and heard people say that the thief had money in his pocket. B said to his friends, that anyone who would rob the thief of his money would lose nothing since the latter was afraid of being caught. B further remarked that he would suggest to his Gentile customer, a chieftain, to rob the thief and then repay him (B) the three schillings the chieftain owed him. A warned B not to do so lest it become known that he, A, bought the stolen goods from the thief. A further warned B that he would hold him responsible for any loss he might suffer because of B&#x2019;s being involved in this matter. B, however, did not heed A&#x2019;s warning, saying that his Gentile customer, the chieftain, was his friend and that he would ask him not to demand from the thief any explanation after taking his money. After B&#x2019;s customer robbed the thief and released him, the latter was arrested by the authorities and was forced to confess to whom he sold the stolen gold, which caused A a heavy loss. A, therefore, demands that B make good that loss.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B&#x2019;s act was only an indirect cause of A&#x2019;s loss; therefore, B owes nothing to A.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A had Gentiles arrest his opponents. One of his opponents resisted arrest; he fled, but was pursued and killed by the Gentiles. A claims that he merely intended to coerce his opponents into answering his summons to court.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A is fully responsible for the murder of his opponent, for when a Jew falls into the clutches of Gentiles, his life as well as his property is in jeopardy; he can expect from them neither pity, mercy, nor restraint. The Gentiles are happy to hold a Jew in their power; and, especially when commissioned by another Jew, their cruelty is boundless. They consider it entirely legitimate and even praiseworthy to rob, maim, and even murder a Jew. Therefore, a person who delivers a fellow Jew into the hands of Gentiles is directly responsible for all their cruelties. Thus A is to be considered as much a murderer as if he killed his opponent with his own hands. No punishment is too great for him, no penance too harsh, and no manner of self-torture too severe. Let him be flogged and publicly disgraced, let him wander as an exile in foreign lands, let his face become black through fasting and self-torture for a year or two, and seek atonement for his crime. I subscribe to any punishment you may impose upon him, no matter how severe; and I would agree to still sterner measures but not to milder ones.</p>

A did so, and was ready to kill himself, but Gentiles saved his life. He inquired of Rabbi Meir whether he was required to do penance for his sin.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. I find great difficulty in deciding this case. A person is indeed permitted to take his own life for the sanctification of God&#x2019;s name; but whether one is permitted to take the lives of others, even for a deeply pious reason, is questionable. However, such an act became widely accepted as permissible, and we have heard of many great authorities who martyrized their sons and daughters. Even Rabbi Kalonymus did so, as he later lamented in a dirge which begins with the words: &#x201C;I say, look away from me [in abhorrence]&#x2026;,&#x201D; [recited in the synagogue on the ninth day of <italic>Ab</italic>]. Thus anyone who should require A to do penance, would thereby vilify the pious men of former days.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. There are many laws and ceremonies connected with executions for which no logical reason is apparent.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Rashi, in his interpretation of the talmudic statement of Menahot 6b (s. v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05DB;&#x05D9; &#x05EA;&#x05D9;&#x05DE;&#x05D0;</span>), implies that after Aaron was appointed to the priesthood non-priests were excluded from serving even at high-places. How, then, did Manoah and Samuel personally offer up sacrifices on high-places? Moreover, [Midrash] Shoher Tob states that Samuel was guilty of three transgressions in making his burnt offering: a) he had no right to act as priest, b) he made the offering at the wrong time, and c) he made the offering on a high-place. The last statement thus supports Rashi&#x2019;s opinion.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The aforesaid opinion of Rashi was refuted by the Tosaphot (Manahot 6b, s. v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05DB;&#x05D9; &#x05EA;&#x05D9;&#x05DE;&#x05D0;</span>) who cited as proof the priestly activities of Samuel and Saul, and the explicit talmudic statement in Zebahim 118a. However, although non-priests were permitted to act as priests in offering up sacrifices on high-places, Levites were never permitted to do the work of priests (Erekin, 11b). The transgression of Samuel, therefore, consisted in acting as priest though he was a Levite.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. What constitutes the merit of emigrating to the Holy Land?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. My knowledge on this subject does not go beyond the talmudic statement (Ket. 111a) that a person who emigrates to the Holy Land is absolved from sin. This applies to a person who commits no sins in the Holy Land proper, and who fulfils all the commandments appertaining to the Holy Land. However, the punishment for a sin committed there is more severe than that for a sin committed elsewhere; for the Lord watches over the Holy Land more diligently, and the land itself can bear no sinners. For this reason the Holy Land is now desolate and contains no walled cities. Therefore, it is to those who go to the Holy Land and intend to be reckless in their behavior and particularly to quarrel there that the verse applies: &#x201C;But when ye entered ye defiled My land (Jer. 2, 7).&#x201D; When, however, a person emigrates to the Holy Land with sincere intentions and conducts himself there in piety and saintliness, his reward is unlimited; provided, of course, that he possess sufficient means of support there.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. Does a person buried in Palestine escape the <italic>hibbut hakkever</italic> (agonies of the grave)?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. I do not know.</p>
<p>3) <italic>Q</italic>. Why did the Amoraim fail to move to the Holy Land?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Such an act would have seriously interferred with their studies, since in the Holy Land they would have to spend much time in finding means of support. A person is permitted even to leave the Holy Land in order to study with his teacher (Erub. 47a); therefore, one is surely not enjoined to break off his uninterrupted studies in the Diaspora and emigrate to the Holy Land where he would find his means of support with great difficulty.</p>
<p>4) <italic>Q</italic>. What is the meaning of the talmudic statement (Ket. 110b): A person who dwells in the Diaspora is as one who has no God?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. God&#x2019;s presence is primarily concentrated in the Holy Land. Therefore, a person&#x2019;s prayers there ascend directly to His throne.</p>

<ftnote id="fn7">&#x002A; The phrase <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05E9;&#x05D1;&#x05E2;&#x05D5;&#x05EA; &#x05DC;&#x05E4;&#x05E0;&#x05D9; &#x05D4;&#x05EA;&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05D4;</span> might mean: <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05F3; &#x05E9;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05D5;&#x05EA; &#x05DC;&#x05E4;&#x05E0;&#x05D9; &#x05D4;&#x05EA;&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05D4;</span> five weeks before the general arrest</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn8">&#x002A; The author uses the term <italic>Bar-meboo</italic>, a resident of A&#x2019;s alley, but he is only using the talmudic expression. The decision, however, is that in his own house B may pursue any craft he wants; while A may restrain B from settling next to A and pursuing A&#x2019;s craft.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn9">&#x002A; According to the question thirty thousand &#x2026; was demanded from A, and according to the answer, one thousand <italic>marks</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn10">&#x002A; The <italic>Mordecai Hagadol</italic> reads: <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05DC;&#x05E0;&#x05D8;&#x05E0;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05D5;&#x05D0;</span> instead of the <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05DC;&#x05E0;&#x05D8; &#x05E0;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D0;</span> of Pr. Therefore it must mean <italic>landgraf</italic>, or landgrave. For a discussion of the identity of the <italic>landgraf</italic> and the amount of accrued interest, see Zimmels, <italic>Beitr&#x00E4;ge zur Geschichte der Juden in Deutschland</italic>, p. 113 foot note 389.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn11">&#x002A; That two questions were asked of R. Meir, one regarding security, and another regarding a surety, is seen from the fact that towards the end of this Responsum (in the Pr. 130 version which deals with a pledge) R. Meir uses the phrase <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05E9; &#x05E2;&#x05E8;&#x05D1; &#x05DC;&#x05D0; &#x05DE;&#x05E9;&#x05EA;&#x05E2;&#x05D1;&#x05D3; &#x05DE;&#x05E7;&#x05F3;&#x05D5; &#x05D4;&#x05DE;&#x05E9;&#x05DB;&#x05D5;&#x05DF; &#x05E2;&#x05E6;&#x05DE;&#x05D5; &#x05E4;&#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05E8; &#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05E9; &#x05D4;&#x05E2;&#x05E8;&#x05DB;</span>, which seems to indicate that the question was also about a surety. Furthermore, Responsum Cr. 34, gives exactly the same answer as Pr. 130, regarding a surety.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn12">&#x002A; Cr. reads: &#x201C;two;&#x201D; Mord. reads: &#x201C;four;&#x201D; L. and Tesh. Maim. read: &#x201C;twenty.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn13">&#x002A; The rental price given above is mentioned in the answer only, and may represent. therefore, a mere arbitrary sum assumed by R. Meir instead of the actual rental.</ftnote>
