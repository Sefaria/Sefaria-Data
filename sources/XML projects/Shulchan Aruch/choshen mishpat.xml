<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 1: THE APPOINTMENT OF THE JUDGES IN AND OUTSIDE THE LAND OF ISRAEL. Contains six paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. Nowadays<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> the Judges may adjudicate cases of admissions<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> and transaction of loans,<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> marriage contracts,<sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> inheritances,<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> gifts<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> and damage done to another person&#x2019;s chattel,<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup> which are matters that are of frequent occurrence and involve a monetary loss;<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup> but matters that are not of frequent occurrence although they involve a monetary loss,<sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup> e.g., cattle that injured other [cattle],<sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup> or matters that do not involve a monetary loss although they are of frequent occurrence,<sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup> e.g., the repayment of the double amount,<sup><xref rid="fn9">9</xref></sup> and likewise, all fines that were imposed by the Sages,<sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup> as [in the case of] one who boxes his neighbour&#x2019;s [ear] &#x2014; <italic>The meaning</italic> [<italic>of Toke&#x2018;a should be understood as</italic>] <italic>&#x2018;He shouts in a</italic> [<italic>loud</italic>] <italic>voice into his</italic> [<italic>neighbour&#x2019;s</italic>] <italic>ear and frightens him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup> &#x2014; or as [in the case of] one who slaps his neighbour &#x2014; <italic>I.e., He strikes</italic> [<italic>him</italic>] <italic>with his hand on the cheek</italic><sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup> &#x2014; and thus also whosoever pays more than the actual damage done, or one who pays half-damages,<sup><xref rid="fn12">12</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] only authoritative Judges<sup><xref rid="fn13">13</xref></sup> duly ordained<sup><xref rid="fn14">14</xref></sup> in the Land of Israel may judge it<sup><xref rid="fn15">15</xref></sup> save [in the case of the liability for] half-damages [done by] pebbles,<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup> which is [regarded as] civil and not [as] penal.<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. [In the case of] a man who injured his fellow-man &#x2014; [the law is that] Judges who are not duly ordained in the Land of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn18">18</xref></sup> cannot order the payment for injury,<sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup> pain,<sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup> blemish,<sup><xref rid="fn20">20</xref></sup> indignity,<sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup> and indemnity,<sup><xref rid="fn21">21</xref></sup> but they may order the payment for loss of time and healing.<sup><xref rid="fn22">22</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And some</italic> <italic>say that also</italic> [<italic>cases of</italic>] <italic>healing and loss of time they</italic><sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup> <italic>do not adjudicate</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn24">24</xref></sup> <italic>However, I have not seen</italic> [<italic>them</italic>] <italic>adopt</italic> [<italic>this</italic>] <italic>practice</italic>, [<italic>viz.</italic>,] <italic>to be strict in this</italic> [<italic>matter</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn25">25</xref></sup> <italic>save that they coerce the injurer</italic><sup><xref rid="fn26">26</xref></sup> <italic>to appease the injured</italic> [<italic>with money</italic>] <italic>and to penalize him according to that which appears</italic> [<italic>reasonable</italic>] <italic>to them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn27">27</xref></sup> <italic>as will be explained anon par.</italic> 5.</p>
<p>3. [With respect to] cattle that injured man, &#x2014; [the law is that] Judges who are not duly ordained in the Land of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> may not collect payment for his injury because it is a matter that is not of frequent occurrence.<sup><xref rid="fn29">29</xref></sup> However, a man who caused damage to his fellow-man&#x2019;s cattle pays full damages everywhere.<sup><xref rid="fn30">30</xref></sup> Likewise, cattle that caused damage by means of Tooth and Foot, since [with respect to the latter] it is regarded as <italic>Mua&#x2018;d ab initio</italic>, this is considered a matter of frequent occurrence, and Judges who are not duly ordained in the Land of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> may order the payment thereof.<sup><xref rid="fn31">31</xref></sup> Thus also, [with respect to] one who stole or robbed<sup><xref rid="fn32">32</xref></sup> [an object], they may collect from him the principal only.<sup><xref rid="fn33">33</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And some say</italic> [<italic>that this applies</italic>] <italic>only to cases of larceny that are of</italic> <italic>frequent occurrence, e.g.,</italic> [<italic>a guardian</italic>] <italic>who denies</italic> [<italic>having received</italic>] <italic>a deposit and the like, but actual larceny is not</italic> [<italic>considered</italic>] <italic>of frequent occurrence and they do not adjudicate</italic> [<italic>this</italic>] <italic>unless the robbed object is</italic> [<italic>still</italic>] <italic>intact</italic>, [<italic>in which case</italic>] <italic>they order</italic> [<italic>him</italic>] <italic>to return it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn34">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. [With respect to] the laws of damage caused indirectly,<sup><xref rid="fn35">35</xref></sup> and likewise, [regarding] the law of the informer,<sup><xref rid="fn36">36</xref></sup> &#x2014; Judges who are not duly ordained in the Land of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn37">37</xref></sup> may adjudicate them.<sup><xref rid="fn38">38</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Witnesses who offered false evidence and were found Zomemim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn39">39</xref></sup> <italic>and they</italic> [<italic>the Judges</italic>] <italic>had</italic> [<italic>already</italic>] <italic>collected payment on</italic> [<italic>the strength of</italic>] <italic>their testimony</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn40">40</xref></sup> <italic>and it is impossible to recover</italic> [<italic>the payment now</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn41">41</xref></sup> &#x2014; [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>they judge them and order them to pay</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn42">42</xref></sup> <italic>V. Infra</italic> &#x00A7; 29, <italic>par.</italic> 2.</p>
<p>5. Although [the law is] that Judges that are not duly ordained in the Land of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> cannot order the payment of fines,<sup><xref rid="fn43">43</xref></sup> [nevertheless], they may place him<sup><xref rid="fn44">44</xref></sup> under the ban until he appeases his litigant [with money],<sup><xref rid="fn45">45</xref></sup> and as soon as he<sup><xref rid="fn44">44</xref></sup> gives him an amount which appears reasonable [to the injurer to be given] to him, they release him<sup><xref rid="fn44">44</xref></sup> [from the ban],<sup><xref rid="fn46">46</xref></sup> <italic>whether his litigant was appeased</italic> [<italic>thereby</italic>] <italic>or whether he was not appeased</italic>. And likewise, if the injured person seized an amount, [viz.,] whatever is proper for him to take, they do not reclaim [it] from him.<sup><xref rid="fn47">47</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And if the injured</italic> <italic>person should say</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn48">48</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;Assess for me my damage so that I should know up to how much I should seize,&#x2019; he is not obeyed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn49">49</xref></sup> <italic>save that if he had already seized, they assess for him</italic> [<italic>his damage</italic>] <italic>and instruct him, &#x2018;So much you may keep</italic> [<italic>as your own</italic>] <italic>and so much you must return</italic> [<italic>to the injurer</italic>].&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn50">50</xref></sup> <italic>And all this</italic><sup><xref rid="fn51">51</xref></sup> [<italic>applies</italic>] <italic>only to fines stated</italic> [<italic>in Biblical Law</italic>], <italic>but</italic> [<italic>as to</italic>] <italic>fines which the Sages come</italic> [<italic>from time to time</italic>] <italic>to impose of their own accord with respect to</italic> [<italic>one who does not observe</italic>] <italic>their ordinance</italic>[<italic>s</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn52">52</xref></sup> <italic>they may collect everywhere</italic><sup><xref rid="fn30">30</xref></sup> <italic>as will be explained in</italic> &#x00A7; 2.<sup><xref rid="fn53">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. One who insults [his fellow-man merely] in words, is placed under the ban until he appeases him<sup><xref rid="fn54">54</xref></sup> as is becoming his<sup><xref rid="fn54">54</xref></sup> dignity.<sup><xref rid="fn55">55</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>V. Infra</italic> &#x00A7; 420, <italic>par.</italic> 38.<sup><xref rid="fn56">56</xref></sup> <italic>V., Infra</italic> &#x00A7; 2 [<italic>regarding the question</italic>] <italic>if one became guilty towards another person</italic><sup><xref rid="fn57">57</xref></sup> <italic>of the punishment of lashes whether he may acquit himself</italic><sup><xref rid="fn58">58</xref></sup> <italic>with money</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1">1) I.e., after the dissolution of the Jewish Commonwealth. Derived from Git. 88b; B.K. 84b; San. 2b-3a, according to which non-<italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> (v. <italic>infra.</italic> n. 13) may adjudicate cases of admissions and transaction of loans which are matters of frequent occurrence and involve a monetary loss, thereby carrying out the commission of the <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> of the Land of Israel. The present ruling applies today to the Land of Israel too. Cf. Git. <italic>ibid., Tosa</italic>f. s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05DE;&#x05DC;&#x05EA;&#x05D0;</span>. Thus also <italic>Asheri</italic> and <italic>Tur.</italic> The underlying reason for this law is given by the <italic>Codifiers</italic> as follows: <italic>&#x2018;Judges and officers thou shalt make thee</italic> in all thy gates <italic>which the Lord thy G-d giveth thee</italic> tribe by tribe (Deut. XVI, 18. This has reference to the Land of Israel only) &#x2014; (this means that) in your gates (i.e., in Israel) tribunals should be set up in every district as well as in every city. However, outside the Land (of Israel) you should set up tribunals in every district but not in every city&#x2019; (Mak. 7a). This, of course, applied only to those times when the original form of &#x2018;ordination&#x2019; (<italic>Semikah</italic>, <span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05DB;&#x05D4;</span>) was in vogue, but nowadays all judges have no authoritative power to adjudicate legal questions Biblically, as it is written, &#x2014; <italic>&#x2018;And these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them</italic> (Ex. XXI, 1) &#x2014; <italic>before them</italic> (i.e., authoritative judges, specially ordained) and not before non-<italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> (laymen judges)&#x2019; &#x2014; Git. <italic>ibid.</italic> Consequently, today we merely act as agents of the former authoritative judges and deal only with matters of frequent occurrence which also involve a monetary loss (<italic>Tur</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> On the question whether we carry out today the commission of the former duly ordained judges Rabbinically or Biblically, there is a difference of opinion among the <italic>Codifiers. N</italic> and <italic>RaShBA</italic> hold that our commission is Rabbinical. <italic>Nethiboth</italic> maintains that it is Biblical.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2">2) Heb. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05D0;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span> admissions. This refers to proceedings resting on evidence of witnesses attesting to the defendant&#x2019;s admission of his indebtedness. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;&#x05D5;&#x05D0;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span> transaction of loans has reference to evidence offered by witnesses who were present at the time of the transaction of the loan. Today the judges may also deal with cases where there are no witnesses, e.g., where one has to take a consuetudinal or equitable oath (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05EA; &#x05D4;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05EA;</span> i.e., if one who is sued for a debt denies the latter entirely (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D5;&#x05E4;&#x05E8; &#x05D4;&#x05DB;&#x05DC;</span>) in contradistinction to the legal or Biblical oath which is required when the defendant admits a part of the claim (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05D4; &#x05D1;&#x05DE;&#x05E7;&#x05E6;&#x05EA;</span>), it being presumed that nobody will go to law unless he have a claim. Consequently, it is a matter of equity to put the opponent to an oath, to which he may in turn put the claimant &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3">3) Containing among other things, the settlement of a certain amount due to the wife on her husband&#x2019;s death or on being divorced. Heb. <italic>Kethubah</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05D4;</span>), &#x2014; the wife&#x2019;s settlement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4">4) Thus <italic>Asheri</italic> and <italic>Tur</italic> derived from San. 3a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05DC;&#x05D0;</span>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5">5) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> V, 9 derived from B.K. <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6">6) In the case of &#x2018;inheritances&#x2019; and &#x2018;gifts&#x2019; which are of frequent occurrence there is also the possibility of a loss involved, for no doubt the claimant must have rendered some service to the bequeather or the donor (Thus <italic>A.H.</italic>). The underlying reason in the case of admissions and the transaction of loans is &#x2018;in order not to shut the door against borrowers&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05DC;&#x05D0; &#x05EA;&#x05E0;&#x05E2;&#x05D5;&#x05DC; &#x05D3;&#x05DC;&#x05EA; &#x05D1;&#x05E4;&#x05E0;&#x05D9; &#x05DC;&#x05D5;&#x05D5;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>). For a creditor will refuse to grant a loan should he find it difficult to collect his debt. The same reason applies to the other matters enumerated here. This (viz., that we deal only with matters of frequent occurrence which involve a monetary loss) has reference only to monetary claims. But in the case of other important matters, such as, accepting converts, although it is of infrequent occurrence, or in the case of compelling an obstinate husband to grant his wife a divorce although it does not involve a monetary loss, the law is that we may deal with such cases &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn7">7) Yad <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn8">8) As a result of goring with the &#x2018;horn&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05E8;&#x05DF;</span>) which is of infrequent occurrence. This, of course, refers not only to damage caused by &#x2018;horn&#x2019; but also to all other types of injury or damage of infrequent occurrence (e.g., damage caused by &#x2018;fire&#x2019; and &#x2018;pit&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05E9; &#x05D6;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;</span>) &#x2014; <italic>Shak.</italic> V. Mishna B.K. I, 1. <italic>P.Tesh.,</italic> however, cites authorities who permit a Jewish Court today to deal in matters pertaining to damage caused by &#x2018;fire&#x2019; and &#x2018;pit&#x2019;). This form of damage is called <span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05D1;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;</span>. Hence, the term <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D7;&#x05D1;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;</span> used here. In the case of damage or injury which is of frequent occurrence and involves a monetary loss, the legal term used is <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05D9;&#x05D6;&#x05E7;</span>. V. <italic>infra</italic> par. 3 &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn9">9) I.e., the additional amount to be paid as fine on restoring stolen goods (Ex. XXII, 3; 6-8). This is derived from San. 8a where it is stated that cases of fine must be dealt with by three authoritative Judges (<italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic>), but not laymen Judges. The repayment of the double amount (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E9;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D9; &#x05DB;&#x05E4;&#x05DC;</span>), it may be asked, in any case belongs to the category of fines (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05E0;&#x05E1;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span>) mentioned anon, and the payment thereof is collected only by authoritative judges (<italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic>)? Furthermore, <italic>Tur</italic> has <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E9;&#x05EA;</span> i.e., payment for indignity suffered which is of frequent occurrence although there is no monetary loss involved. Likewise, in the foregoing example of matters of infrequent occurrence although there is no monetary loss involved, <italic>Tur</italic> has &#x2018;e.g., if a man injured another man&#x2019; instead of <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s example (following <italic>Maim.</italic> in Yad <italic>ibid.</italic>) &#x2018;cattle that injured other cattle&#x2019;. The difficulty may be removed if we understand our text as follows: First <italic>Caro</italic> states examples (e.g., the repayment of the double amount and cattle that injured other cattle) which are specifically of a penal nature (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05E0;&#x05E1;</span>) and then the general proviso, &#x2018;and likewise all fines&#x2019; which the Rabbis equated to these examples. Consequently, the examples cited by <italic>Tur</italic> are included in the general statement concerning fines &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn10">10) B.K. <italic>ibid.</italic> dealing with a case where R. &#x1E24;isda consulted R. Na&#x1E25;man and the latter replied, &#x2018;&#x1E24;isda, &#x1E24;isda, are you really prepared to order the collection of fines in Babylon?&#x2019; Cf. also B.K. 27b. For the right to collect fines was confined only to the Judges of the land of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn11">11) V., Mishna B.K. VIII, 6(90a). Cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 420, 41. <italic>Caro</italic> adopts <italic>Maim.</italic> (Yad <italic>ibid.</italic>) explanation of <span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05E7;&#x05E2;</span>; <italic>Isserless</italic> accepts the explanation of <italic>Rashi</italic> and <italic>RaN</italic> (v. B.K. 90a and Kid. 11b, <italic>Rashi</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05E7;&#x05E2;</span> and cf. <italic>RaN ibid.</italic>). V., B.K. 84b, <italic>Rashi</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05E4;&#x05D2;&#x05DD;</span> whence it is implied that if the amount is not definitive it is not regarded as a fine. Yet, since it is of infrequent occurrence and does not involve a monetary loss, we cannot order its collection. The Rabbis, however, called it <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05E0;&#x05E1;</span> (fine) because the law thereof is similar to fines. Cf. B.K. 27b, 84b, <italic>Tosaf</italic>, s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05E0;&#x05E1;&#x05D0;</span> &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn12">12) B.K. 15b, 27b; Ket. 41b and v. <italic>Tur.</italic> E.g., the repayment of the double amount (Ex. XXII, 3) or the four or five-fold restitution of stolen goods (Ex. XXI, 37), or on restoring misappropriated property, one fifth of the principal had to be added as a fine (Lev. V, 16, 24; XXVII, 27), or half-damages done by an innocuous animal (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05DD;</span>), i.e., an animal that did not gore three times and did injury before warning had been given, opp. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05D3;</span> (Ex. XXI, 28-36; B.K. I, 4; II, 4). Cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 390 and v. Yad <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn13">13) Heb. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span> i.e., experienced scholars versed in matters of law who alone are referred to by the Scriptural term <italic>Elohim</italic> meaning &#x2018;Judges&#x2019; as in Ex. XXI, 6; XXII, 7-8. V., San. 2b; <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 3, 2. Cf. <italic>supra</italic> n. 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn14">14) San. 14a. On the question of &#x2018;Ordination&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05DB;&#x05D4;</span>), v. Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> IV and cf. Y.D. &#x00A7; 242; <italic>supra</italic> n. 1; J.P. Y.D. &#x00A7; 335-403, Int. XI-XII.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn17">17) B.K. 15b; Ket. 41b. In addition to the matters mentioned <italic>supra, Semikah</italic> (Ordination) nowadays is also valid for dealing in matters pertaining to <italic>&#x1E24;alizah</italic> and Divorce &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn18">18) V., <italic>supra</italic> par. 1, n. 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn19">19) Tur citing Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> V, 10. Derived from Mishna B.K. VIII, 1 and Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic> 84a-b where it is stated that the liability for injury (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05D6;&#x05E7;</span>) is determined by regarding the injured person as if he were a slave sold in the market place and an assessment is made as to how much he was worth before the injury was inflicted and how much he is worth now. Although there is a monetary loss involved, yet since this is of infrequent occurrence, Judges nowadays cannot order the payment thereof (v. par. 1). Much more so in the case of pain (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E6;&#x05E2;&#x05E8;</span>) and indignity (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E9;&#x05EA;</span>) where no monetary loss is involved that payment cannot be ordered by present day Judges.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn20">20) Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> and <italic>Tur</italic> a.l. do not include blemish (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E4;&#x05D2;&#x05DD;</span>). <italic>Ta</italic>Z states that <italic>M</italic>&#x2019;s version of the of the Talmud (B.K. 84b) did not have &#x2018;blemish.&#x2019; MS.M. also omits &#x2018;blemish&#x2019; although found in cur. edd. Liability for blemish applies only in the case of rape (v. E.H. &#x00A7; 177). Blemish stands on an equal footing as injury (v. B.K. <italic>ibid., Rashi</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05E4;&#x05D2;&#x05DD;</span>). It may, however, be asked, why blemish (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E4;&#x05D2;&#x05DD;</span>) which is of frequent occurrence and involves a monetary loss (B.K. <italic>ibid.</italic>) should not be adjudicated today? This difficulty may be removed if we realize that &#x2018;frequent occurrence&#x2019; of blemish applies only to the assessment, i.e., we know how to determine the liability of blemish (the difference in valuation between a virgin <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;</span> and a non-virgin <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05E2;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;</span>), but the actual <italic>act</italic> of rape is of infrequent occurrence &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn22">22) Yad <italic>ibid.,</italic> derived from Raba&#x2019;s dictum in B.K. 84a, &#x2018;Payment for which the injured person would have to be valued as if he were a slave is not collected in Babylon,&#x2019; which is explained (thus <italic>Kes. Mish.; B.Yos.; MaHaRIK</italic> Rt. 1 a.o.) as referring to &#x2018;injury&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05D6;&#x05E7;</span>) only, which, it is true, involves a monetary loss, but is of infrequent occurrence (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 19). Hence, Raba&#x2019;s dictum does not include &#x2018;loss of time&#x2019; and &#x2018;healing.&#x2019; Consequently, payment may be ordered by a Jewish Court today for the latter. Thus also <italic>Isserlein</italic> in his <italic>Decisions</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E4;&#x05E1;&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>) &#x2014; that nowadays we may order payment for &#x2018;healing&#x2019; and &#x2018;loss of time&#x2019; and likewise impose a fine upon the offender. <italic>Asheri</italic> and <italic>Alfasi</italic>, however, hold that payment for the latter are not ordered today. Raba&#x2019;s dictum is explained by them to refer to anything that requires valuation (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05DC; &#x05D4;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05DD;</span>). <italic>Caro</italic>, however, accepts the opinion of <italic>Maim.</italic> since it is supported by the <italic>Geoninm</italic> (Yad <italic>ibid.</italic>).

Hence, only the principal may be collected. V., also B.K. 115a where such cases were dealt with in Babylon and B.K. 96b in the case of the man who misappropriated a pair of oxen and B.K. 21a in the case of a certain person who built a villa on the ruins that belonged to orphans and when R. Na&#x1E25;man advised the defendant to make a peaceful settlement with the orphans, he refused to do so, whereupon R. Na&#x1E25;man confiscated the villa. Cf. also <italic>ibid.</italic> 37a and 4b. In the latter reference it is stated that theft (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05D1;&#x05D4;</span>) and larceny (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05D6;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;</span>) involve civil liability. A difficulty, however, presents itself, viz., in the Mishna San. I, 1 and Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic> 3a we are told that cases of larceny are dealt with by <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> Judges only, which contradicts the present ruling. <italic>Tosaf.</italic> (ibid. s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05DC;&#x05D0;</span>; B.K. 84b s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9; &#x05E0;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;</span>; Git. 88b s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9; &#x05D4;&#x05DB;&#x05D9;</span>) explain that the Mishna <italic>ibid.</italic> refers to cases of larceny by means of injury inflicted (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05D6;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;&#x05EA; &#x05E2;&#x05F4;&#x05D9; &#x05D7;&#x05D1;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span>), in which case only <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> Judges may adjudicate the matter. Hence, in such cases of larceny we nowadays cannot act as the agents of the former authoritative Judges, since this is a matter of infrequent occurrence, but cases of larceny where no bodily injury resulted we may act as the agents of the former. Thus also <italic>Kes. Mish.</italic> and <italic>B.Yos. N.Yos.,</italic> however, removes the above difficulty as follows: <italic>Caro&#x2019;s</italic> ruling that we may order the payment of the principal in cases of larceny refers only to matters of frequent occurrence, such as, one who denies a deposit (v. <italic>Gloss</italic> anon), but actual larceny is of infrequent occurrence. Hence, it is not adjudicated today (v. <italic>D.M.</italic> a.l.). <italic>ShaK</italic> advances a different opinion, viz., that in San. <italic>ibid.</italic> we deal with the adjudication of fines, e.g., the repayment of the double amount, the four and five-fold restitution, which require only <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> Judges (v. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1 and notes), but the actual principal is recoverable even by laymen Judges (this is however, a stained interpretation, since the payment of the double etc., refers to cases of theft but not to larceny &#x2014; <italic>Ba&#x2019;er Heteb</italic>). <italic>ShaK</italic> also writes that the increment (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D1;&#x05D7;</span>) of the misappropriated article prior to the owner&#x2019;s resignation, is also recoverable today <italic>contra Ba&#x1E24;. RaN</italic> and <italic>N</italic> offer an altogether different explanation in removing the above difficulty, viz., that as to San. <italic>ibid.</italic> that requires <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> in cases of larceny, it has reference only to the period when such Judges were available, but if, as today, <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> are no longer available, even laymen Judges may deal with such matters.

Ashi, who in his childhood had destroyed by burning, the bond of a creditor, to make payment &#x2018;like a beam fit for decorative mouldings,&#x2019; i.e., a proverbial expression for &#x2018;straight and exact&#x2019; and out of the best of one&#x2019;s estate (v. <italic>ibid.</italic> 5a), whence we see that payment for indirect damage (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05E8;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;</span>) may be collected even by laymen Judges outside the Land of Israel, and such payment is not regarded as a fine (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05E0;&#x05E1;</span>).

In other words, they are proven to have been &#x2018;schemers&#x2019; or &#x2018;plotters,&#x2019; and they are punished by the law of retaliation (Deut. XIX, 16ff.). According to <italic>W.G., Isserles</italic> mentions this ruling here, since as in the aforementioned law of the &#x2018;informer&#x2019; damage is caused by mere speech without tangible action (this is also apparent in <italic>Mord</italic>. to B.K.

<ftnote id="fn40">40) This applies only if money had already been collected on their testimony, although the principle, <italic>as he had purposed to do</italic> (Deut. <italic>ibid.</italic>) and not <italic>as he had done</italic> (v. &#x1E24;ul. 11b, <italic>Rashi</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05E0;&#x05D4;&#x05E8;&#x05D2;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span> and <italic>Torah Temimah ibid.</italic>) would imply that only if the money had not yet been collected from the person against whom they plotted is payment exacted from th <italic>Zomemim</italic> witnesses, but not if payment had been ordered and paid, &#x2014; nevertheless, in civil liability (as in the present case) the above principle (which is of a penal nature) is not applicable (v. B.K. 4b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>). The reason why the example of <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05D6;&#x05DE;&#x05D4;</span> (the refutation of the witnesses by another set of witnesses by proving an <italic>alibi</italic>, e.g., &#x2018;How can you offer this testimony, if, at the time you state that the alleged offence was committed, you were present with us in another locality?&#x2019;) is mentioned, and not the example of <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05DB;&#x05D7;&#x05E9;&#x05D4;</span> (counter-evidence which contradicts the testimony of the first set of witnesses), is because in the latter case when two witnesses state that So-and-So borrowed money from So-and-So, as a result of which money was collected on their testimony, and subsequently, two other witnesses came and offered counterevidence, the former set of witnesses cannot be ordered to make payment, for we may say, that the evidence offered by the second set of witnesses does not carry more weight than that of the first set. Not so, however, if the witnesses are proven <italic>Zomemim</italic> (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 31, 38; &#x00A7; 46, 37) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> V., also <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 28, 3, <italic>Gloss</italic>. However, if the testimony of the witnesses, who were subsequently proven <italic>Zomemi</italic>m, merely exempted the defendant from taking an oath, thereby causing damage to the claimant, &#x2014; for if the defendant would have had to take an oath (which, now it appears would have been a false oath), he would have made payment instead of swearing falsely, &#x2014; nevertheless, the <italic>Zomemim</italic> witnesses are not required to make restitution, for this is not considered a case of <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D0; &#x05D3;&#x05D2;&#x05E8;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;</span> (indirect damage which is discernible.

<ftnote id="fn44">44) The injurer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn45">45) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> V, 17 and <italic>Alfasi</italic> to B.K. VIII on the authority of the <italic>Yeshiboth</italic> presided over by the <italic>Geonim</italic>. Thus also <italic>Tur.</italic> The injurer is placed under the ban only in the case where he or his chattel caused injury, because the injured person does not receive more than the damage incurred, and should we not adopt this stringency one would feel that he is free to injure his fellow-man and be entirely exempt. This, however, does not have reference to cases which involve the payment of the double amount or the four or five-fold restitution &#x2014; <italic>M.E., ShaK, RaShaL. &#x2018;Ir Shushan</italic> writes that when the defendant is placed under the ban, which is lifted only after he appeases the plaintiff by compensating the latter for the damage, such compensation must include not only an approximate amount of the actual damages suffered but also of the payment of the double and the four and five-fold restitution. <italic>M.E.</italic> rejects this ruling because as stated above the injurer is placed under the ban only in the case where there is no additional payment of fines.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn46">46) This does not refer to an exact amount corresponding to the damage but rather to an approximate amount. Thus also <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>R. Sherira Gaon, Asheri</italic> and <italic>Alfasi</italic>. This explains the words, &#x2018;they release him (from the ban),&#x2019; i.e., although the injured person demands full payment. This also follows from the <italic>Gloss</italic> of <italic>Isserles</italic>, &#x2018;whether his litigant was appeased etc.&#x2019; The following words, however, &#x2018;if the injured person seized an amount etc.,&#x2019; refers to seizure of the full amount. The latter statement has reference to a seizure that also compensates the injured person with respect to the payment of the double amount or the four or five-fold restitution. Biblically, one who admits an act with which a fine is connected, is exempt from the fine (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05D4; &#x05D1;&#x05E7;&#x05E0;&#x05E1; &#x05E4;&#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;</span> v. Ket. 43a). But the admission must be made in the presence of a Court duly ordained (v. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1, n. 1). Hence, nowadays the defendant&#x2019;s admission would not exempt him from the additional fine also seized by the claimant, save that the following distinction should be borne in mind, viz., that if the defendant admitted that witnesses were present during the time that the damage was done, he is still held responsible and his admission does not exempt him, but if no witnesses were present at that time, the claimant&#x2019;s seizure of the additional amount corresponding to the fine is not valid &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth</italic>. If the injurer died, we do not place his heir under the ban, for the main purpose of the Geonic enactment (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 45) was that violent men should not be on the increase. Hence, the injurer only is placed under a ban but not his heir in the case of the former&#x2019;s death &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth</italic> and <italic>Tummim.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn47">47) Conclusion reached in B.K. 15b; Ket. 41b. This ruling applies even if the plaintiff seized an amount corresponding to the fine as well, for the law is that had we been permitted to adjudicate this matter today, the defendant would have paid an amount corresponding to the actual damage plus the fine. Consequently, the plaintiff&#x2019;s seizure is considered valid. So also <italic>Asheri</italic> and <italic>Tur</italic> (<italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 349 end). V., also <italic>Isserles infra</italic> &#x00A7; 348, 4 <italic>Gloss. Caro</italic> and <italic>Isserles</italic> state the law here without making a distinction as to whether the seizure was made at the time the damage was suffered or subsequent to that, or whether the chattel that caused the damage was seized by the injured person or other possessions of the injurer. <italic>R. Tam</italic> in <italic>Tosaf.</italic> to B.K. and Ket. <italic>ibid.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D0;&#x05D9; &#x05EA;&#x05E4;&#x05E1;</span> holds that the plaintiff seized the animal that caused the damage, i.e., before it reached the owner&#x2019;s hand. Thus <italic>Hag. Maim.</italic> to Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> This is substantiated by Ket. 84b according to which R. Tarfon maintains that the seizure of a man&#x2019;s produce by a creditor is valid after the latter&#x2019;s death, provided, &#x2014; as Rab and Samuel explain &#x2014; it lies in a heap in a public domain, i.e., in a place where <italic>Meshikah</italic> is possible. In other words, before it passes into the hands of the heirs. V., <italic>Hag. Derisha u-Perisha</italic>. But other chattels cannot be seized by him. For if so, the plaintiff will continue to seize thereafter other items too, and we would not be able to dispossess him thereof, since this comes under the category of &#x2018;fines&#x2019; which are not adjudicated today. <italic>Asheri</italic> on the other hand, maintains, that even other chattels, not necessarily the animal that caused the damage, may be seized. Should he seize more than his damage we may dispossess him of the surplus which does not come under the category of &#x2018;fines&#x2019; since the adjudication will be for the surplus seizure which is permissible to be dealt with by the Judges. V., also <italic>RIDBaZ</italic> to Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> who writes that were <italic>R. Tam</italic>&#x2019;s explanation correct, the text should have stated <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D0;&#x05D9; &#x05EA;&#x05E4;&#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05D4;</span> i.e., &#x2018;he seized it&#x2019; and would be referring to the tort-feasant animal or the like (v. B.K. and Ket. <italic>ibid.</italic>). Furthermore, the law is that the nuisance, in this case the animal, must be abated, as R. Nathan said, &#x2018;Whence is it derived that a man should not breed a bad dog in his house? &#x2014; From the text, <italic>That thou bring not blood upon thy house</italic> (Deut. XXII, 8).&#x2019; Hence, we see that <italic>Caro</italic> and <italic>Isserles</italic> in stating the law here adopt the opinion of <italic>Asheri</italic>. <italic>Mord</italic>. writes that if the damage was caused through &#x2018;Horn&#x2019; we follow <italic>R. Tam</italic>, and in other cases of damage (e.g., cattle that caused damage to man even through &#x2018;Tooth&#x2019; and &#x2018;Foot&#x2019; which are of infrequent occurrence. Thus <italic>K.H.</italic>) we adopt the opinion of <italic>Asheri</italic>. In the case of an &#x2018;innocuous animal&#x2019; (<italic>Tam.</italic> V., Glos.) that caused damage, some say that the seizure is valid only if the plaintiff seized the animal proper, for the owner of such an animal pays only half-damages and the payment is made out of the body of the tort-feasant animal (v.

The seizure spoken of here refers to one made in accordance with Jewish Law but not if carried out through non-Jewish Law (<italic>RaShaL</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.

Cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 4 <italic>Gloss</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> If a guardian advances the plea of theft in the case of an article which was entrusted with him for safekeeping and took the &#x2018;guardians&#x2019; oath&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05EA; &#x05D4;&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>) after which it was discovered that he himself had stolen the deposited article, &#x2014; the law is that if the plaintiff seized an amount including the payment of the double amount or the four or five-fold restitution, since nowadays one is not required to pay the latter, the reason being that the oath must be taken before a duly ordained Court comprised of <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in,</italic> &#x2014; the seizure is not valid &#x2014; <italic>ShaK, Nethiboth</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn48">48) To the Judges.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn49">49) For otherwise it would mean that we adjudicate penal cases. But whatever he is instructed to return to the injurer does not come under the category of penal matters, since he had already seized it himself. <italic>RaShaL</italic> rules in accord with <italic>Alfasi</italic> that with respect to anything which is of a civil and not of a penal nature save that it is of infrequent occurrence, we do obey him and assess the damage for him &#x2014; <italic>ShaK</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn50">50) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>Asheri</italic> to B.K. VIII and to B.K. I end &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> This is <italic>contra MaHaRIW</italic> who maintains that all that was seized by the claimant must be returned. <italic>Isserles</italic>, as can be seen, adopts the opinion of <italic>Asheri</italic> that only the surplus should be restored. <italic>Asheri</italic> and <italic>Tur</italic> also rule that if the plaintiff does not produce witnesses that he is entitled to the amount seized, he must return whatever he seized. <italic>Isserles</italic>, however, writes that this applies only if he seized in the presence of witnesses, but if the seizure was not in the presence of witnesses, and the defendant denies having incurred any damage, the claimant is believed on the principle of <italic>Miggo</italic> (a legal rule according to which a deponent&#x2019;s statement is accepted as true on the ground that if he had intended to tell a lie, he might have invented one more advantageous to his case, viz., he might have said, &#x2018;I did not seize at all&#x2019;). V., <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 87, 30. This principle applies not only to claims of civil liability but also to those of a penal nature (<italic>Mord</italic>. to B.K.

Mordekai ha-Lewi</italic> (cited by <italic>Tur ibid.</italic>) states that the principle of <italic>Miggo</italic> is not valid in penal cases. Thus also <italic>N.Yos.</italic> to B.K. III end; <italic>Mag. Mish.</italic> to Yad, <italic>Nizke Mamon</italic> IX end. In the case where the injurer died, the seizure of the orphans&#x2019; money or chattels is not valid in penal cases, for legally movable property of orhpans does not become mortgaged to a creditor save that the <italic>Geonim</italic> decreed that they become mortgaged. But this Geonic decree certainly does not apply to penal cases &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth, A.H.</italic> If the injured person seized an amount which also corresponds to the fine, after which the injurer reseized the fine, the Judges nowadays cannot order this fine to be returned to the injured person, for if so, it would mean that they adjudicate fines &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth. R.A.Eger</italic>, however, states that the amount corresponding to the fine may be restored to the injured person, for once the latter seized this amount it became his personal property and no longer falls under the category of fines &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>

This means that legally even duly ordained <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> Judges cannot order the payment for insult in words. However, in accord with Y.B.K.

<ftnote id="fn59">1) Provided permission was obtained from the local government to deal in such matters. Otherwise, it would be considered as rebelling against the nations among whom we live, which is forbidden. V., Ket. 111a; &#x2018;The Holy One, blessed be He, adjured Israel not to rebel against the nations of the world.&#x2019; Cf. also <italic>My son, fear thou the Lord and the King</italic> (Prov. XXIV, 21) ; &#x2018;Earthly royalty is similar to that of Heaven&#x2019; (Ber. 58a) &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn60">2) Even a Court of Law outside the Land of Israel &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn61">3) V. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 1, n. 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn62">4) Even if there is one individual who is in the habit of violating the law, he may be penalized by the Court of Law, although the punishment meted out is not in accordance with Biblical law, only that when the people as a whole are unrestrained in transgressing laws, they may enact measures as a safeguard and they may inflict penalties on any one person for the infringement of their rules even if they did not see that person committing sins unrestrainably &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn63">5) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> It may, however, be asked (in accordance with the interpretation of <italic>M.E.</italic>), why should an individual transgressor be considered as falling under the category of &#x2018;exigencies of the hour?&#x2019; This should, therefore, be understood as follows: If we withhold punishment from an habitual individual sinner, others will learn from his evil ways and will likewise become unrestrained in the commission of sins. Hence, the exigencies of the hour apply here too (<italic>Tummim</italic>). Others, however, maintain that the individual may be penalized even when the foregoing reason is not applicable (<italic>Shebuth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn64">6) Derived from San. 46a, Yeb. 90b: &#x2018;It was taught, R. Eliezer b. Jacob stated: I heard that the Court of Law may (whenever necessary) administer punishment by lashes and impose (capital) sentences, even though not (warranted) by Biblical law; not for the purpose of disregarding the Torah but in order to make a fence around the Torah. It once happened that a man rode on horseback on the Sabbath during the Greek period and was brought before the Court of Law and was stoned, not because he was liable to this penalty, but because the needs of the hour demanded it. It also happened that a man had intercourse with his wife under a fig tree and was brought before the Court of Law and was flogged, not because he deserved it, but because the needs of the hour demanded it.&#x2019; <italic>N.Yos.</italic>, however, writes that the above penalties were imposed by the <italic>Great Sanhedrin</italic> but any other Court of Law does not have the authority to administer such punishment. He adduces the following text to prove his point: San. 52b: &#x2018;Immarta, the daughter of Tali, a <italic>Kohen</italic>, committed adultery. In consequence of that, R. &#x1E24;ama b. Tobiah had her surrounded by faggots and burnt. R. Joseph said: He (R. &#x1E24;ama) was unaware of two laws. He was unaware of R. Mathna&#x2019;s statement (that burning was executed by pouring molten lead down the culprit&#x2019;s throat) and was ignorant of the following Baraitha: <italic>And thou shalt come unto the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days</italic> (Deut. XVII, 9). This teaches that when the priesthood operates (in the Temple), the Judge operates (with respect to capital punishment) ; but when the priesthood does not operate, the Judge may not function.&#x2019; Hence, R. &#x1E24;ama, who flourished after the destruction of the Temple had no authority to impose capital punishment. <italic>N.Yos.</italic> cites additional cases to corroborate his viewpoint: Nid. 13b, San. 58b: &#x2018;R. &#x1E24;ama had the hand of one who was accustomed to strike other people cut off.&#x2019; San. 27a: &#x2018;The Exilarch (<italic>Resh Galutha</italic>) said to R. Abba b. Jacob, Go and investigate the matter; if he is definitely the murderer, dim his eyes.&#x2019; In these latter cases only partial punishment was administered but not full punishment in accordance with Biblical law. However, <italic>N.Yos.</italic> is opposed by the <italic>Codifiers</italic> (v. also <italic>D.M.</italic>) who hold that if <italic>the needs of the hour demand it</italic> even full punishment may be meted out including capital sentences although it would not be in accordance with Biblical law where legal warning and valid witnesses are required which would be difficult to obtain nowadays as a result of which the world would become full of violence and ultimately destroyed. Cf. &#x2018;Jerusalem was destroyed because judgments were rendered in accordance with strict Biblical law&#x2019; (B.M. 30b). Thus <italic>RaShBA, N</italic>, and <italic>Asheri</italic> in <italic>Resp.</italic> Hence, <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s ruling here. V., also the case of Simeon b. Sheta&#x1E25; in Mishna San. 45b who hanged eighty women at Ashkelon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn65">7) M.K. 16a; B.K. 96b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn66">8) <italic>Ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn67">9) Kid. 81a; San. 26b and <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05D7;&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;</span>; <italic>Tur</italic> citing Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXIV, 4. This means that there was no legal warning given by witnesses to the offender immediately before committing the offense. For witnesses and legal warning are required only when adjudicating a Biblical law, but one who disobeys the ordinances of the country may be penalized according to the needs of the hour (<italic>N</italic> in <italic>Resp.</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E., ShaK</italic>. In capital cases the consent of the town Elders is required after due deliberation (<italic>B.Yos.</italic> citing <italic>RaShBA</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn68">10) Derived from Mishna Git. 88b: &#x2018;A heathen court may impose flogging upon a man and say to him, Do whatever the Israelite (authorities) tell you.&#x2019; Since <italic>Caro</italic> does not record here the latter statement of the Mishna (as found in <italic>Tur</italic>), viz., &#x2018;and say to him, Do whatver the Israelite (authorities) tell you,&#x2019; it follows that even the final legal proceedings may be carried out by the heathen authorities since the offender is a very harsh person and the penalty is not in accordance with Biblical law &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> For only in the case of a <italic>Get</italic> (as in Git. <italic>ibid.</italic>) must the final legal proceedings be executed by Israelite authorities in order that it be considered valid &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth</italic>. V., also <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn69">11) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXIV, 4-10 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Derived from M.K. 16a where Scriptural verses are adduced whence we derive that we have the authority to excommunicate persons refusing to obey the summons of the Court, to pronounce the <italic>&#x1E24;erem</italic> (v. Glos.), to forfeit property, to curse, to smite, to pluck one&#x2019;s hair, to adjure (so that one desists from malpractices), to fetter, to arrest and to prosecute. &#x2018;We administer flogging on account of an evil rumour, because it is said, <italic>Nay</italic> (<italic>al</italic>), <italic>my sons; for it is no good report that I hear</italic>&#x2019; (I Sam. II, 24) &#x2014; Kid. 81a. This has reference to an uninterrupted rumour not due to intimidation and where no enemies are about who might have published the rumour &#x2014; Yeb. 25a. Cf. <italic>Tur.</italic> O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 11. V., also Git. 36b on the Rabbis&#x2019; power to expropriate one&#x2019;s property; also Meg. 25b where it is stated that it is permissible to abuse a person of ill fame. The latter statement refers to an ordinary person but not to a scholar (<italic>RaN</italic>). Cf. Men. 99b: &#x2018;Resh Lakish said, A scholar-disciple who has committed a misdeed should not be reproached in public because it is said, <italic>Therefore shalt thou stumble in the day and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night</italic> (Hos. IV, 5), that is to say, Keep it dark like night.&#x2019; The par. passage in M.K. 17a reads that &#x2018;they do not place him under the ban.&#x2019; Some <italic>Later Authorities</italic> rule that the Court of Law has the power only to declare a debt cancelled but they cannot take possession of the money or the like on behalf of a person before it reaches the latter&#x2019;s hand (<italic>Birke Yosef</italic>). Others (on the basis of Git. 36b) hold that the Court of Law does have this authority even before it reaches the latter&#x2019;s hand &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn70">12) Cf. San. 46a: &#x2018;Not with the purpose of disregarding the Torah, but in order to safeguard it.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn71">13) Derived from B.K. 96b regarding the man who misappropriated a pair of oxen and was penalized by R. Na&#x1E25;man, whence we see that only a distinguished personage like R. Na&#x1E25;man who was the son-in-law of the <italic>Nasi</italic>&#x2019;s house had the power to impose penalties.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn72">14) V. B.B. 8b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn73">15) Tur has <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D4;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05D5;&#x05DD; &#x05E8;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05DD; &#x05E2;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05D4;&#x05DD;</span> &#x2018;whom the public recognized as authorities over themselves.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn74">16) <italic>Mord</italic>. (B.M. II beg.) on the authority of <italic>R. Gershon</italic> states: &#x2018;Whosoever is appointed a leader of the community is regarded like the mightiest of the mighty and Jepthah in his generation is like Samuel in his generation (R.H. 25b) and whatever he does is considered binding.&#x2019; Thus also <italic>RaShBA</italic> &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn75">17) <italic>MaHaRIK</italic> (Rt. I, XIV) writes that even according to the opinion that the representatives of the town have the power to enact measures as they see fit, it applies only to communal needs but not with respect to cancelling a debt of one individual for the benefit of another which does not fall under the category of communal needs. Thus also <italic>Isserlein</italic> in his <italic>Decisions</italic>. Furthermore, only one who is a distinguished personage in his generation may expropriate property &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Cf. <italic>supra</italic> n. 13. If the custom in the community is to submit the matter to arbitration by one litigant choosing one person and the other litigant choosing another person and the Head of the Court of Law acting as the third, &#x2014; this practice should not be altered &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn76">18) B.B. 8b: &#x2018;The townspeople have a right to stipulate meassures, prices of food and wages of labourers and to remove (place outside of the protection of the law &#x2014; <italic>Rashi</italic>) those who disregard the terms fixed by the authorities (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;&#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05E2; &#x05E2;&#x05DC; &#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05E6;&#x05EA;&#x05DF;</span>). The dissenting opinion takes <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;&#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05E2;</span> as referring to &#x2018;measures etc.,&#x2019; i.e., just as in the latter case it must be with the consent of all, so too in the case of &#x2018;terms fixed by the authorities,&#x2019; the consent of all is required. The first opinion takes <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;&#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05E2;</span> as a separate measure. Hence, the consent of all is not required &#x2014; <italic>W.G.</italic> Cf. also Y. Meg. III, 2(74a) : &#x2018;The seven representatives of the town are regarded as the (entire) town. What are we treating of? If they (the townspeople) accepted them, then even if one (was appointed his decision should be binding upon all the townspeople) ; if they did not accept them, then even many (i.e., more than seven cannot enforce their rulings upon the townspeople). We, therefore, deal here with an undefined case (i.e., the townspeople appointed them to look after the communal matters, without specifying which matter they delegated to them, and the town representatives sold aught without consulting the people, we are therefore, informed that their transaction is binding).&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn77">19) I.e., by mere speech the matter becomes binding even in a matter concerning which no adopted practice existed formerly &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn78">20) For this does not come under the category of safeguarding a cause &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> V., also <italic>&#x1E24;id. Hag. P. Tesh</italic> cites the case of the controversy around the Sulzbach edition of the Talmud. The latter was forbidden to be printed until a certain period would elapse after the Amsterdam edition of the Talmud was published. Certain authorities ruled that the purchasers of the Sulzbach ed. were prohibited to study in it. <italic>Zikron Ya&#x2018;akob</italic>, however, on the basis of the present ruling, held that since this prohibition would involve a gain for one (i.e., the Amsterdam publisher) and a loss for the other (i.e., the Sulzbach publisher), the law is that those who had already bought the Sulzbach edition were permitted to use it.

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 3: WITH HOW MANY JUDGES DO WE HOLD JUDICIAL SESSIONS. Contains four paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. A Court of Law must consist of not less than three [Judges]<sup><xref rid="fn84">1</xref></sup> and every [group of] three [Judges] is called a Court of Law even if they be laymen.<sup><xref rid="fn85">2</xref></sup> <italic>For it is impossible that there should not be among them</italic> [<italic>at least</italic>] <italic>one who has a knowledge of</italic> <italic>logical inferences in</italic> [<italic>civil</italic>] <italic>laws</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn86">3</xref></sup> <italic>However, if there is not among them</italic> [<italic>at least</italic>] <italic>one</italic> [<italic>who has such knowledge</italic>], <italic>they are disqualified to judge</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn87">4</xref></sup> <italic>Nevertheless, they may receive the pleas</italic> [<italic>of the contesting parties</italic>] <italic>and forward them to one who is qualified to render legal decisions</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn88">5</xref></sup> They may try the defendant<sup><xref rid="fn89">6</xref></sup> against his will<sup><xref rid="fn90">7</xref></sup> if the latter<sup><xref rid="fn91">8</xref></sup> declines to come down before Court,<sup><xref rid="fn92">9</xref></sup> or he is not willing to attend the Court with the plaintiff in his<sup><xref rid="fn93">10</xref></sup> home town.<sup><xref rid="fn94">11</xref></sup> But if he is willing to attend the Court with him<sup><xref rid="fn95">12</xref></sup> in his<sup><xref rid="fn93">10</xref></sup> home town, only that he is not pleased with the three [Judges] whom the plaintiff has chosen, &#x2014; then [the law is that] each [litigant] chooses one [Judge and the two Judges together choose a third].<sup><xref rid="fn96">13</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>As stated infra &#x00A7; 13. It seems to me</italic> [<italic>that this applies</italic>] <italic>only to Judges who are not permanent, but if there are permanent Judges in town he cannot say, &#x2018;I will attend Court</italic> <italic>in their presence only on</italic> [<italic>the condition that</italic>] <italic>each</italic> [<italic>litigant</italic>] <italic>chooses</italic> [<italic>one Judge and the two Judges together choose a third</italic>]&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn97">14</xref></sup> <italic>Thus is the accepted custom in our town. V., infra &#x00A7; 22, par. 1 end</italic>.</p>
<p>2. [If] less than three [Judges tried a monetary case] their decision is not binding,<sup><xref rid="fn98">15</xref></sup> even [if] they did not render an erroneous decision,<sup><xref rid="fn99">16</xref></sup> unless the litigants accepted them [to abide by their ruling],<sup><xref rid="fn100">17</xref></sup> or [in the case of] one who is a recognized <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn101">18</xref></sup> <italic>Nowadays we do not conduct proceedings of adjudication</italic> [<italic>of monetary cases by</italic>] <italic>a recognized Mum&#x1E25;eh so that he judge</italic> [<italic>not</italic>] <italic>alone against the will of an individual</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn102">19</xref></sup> Every [group] that does not consist of three [Judges],<sup><xref rid="fn103">20</xref></sup> <italic>and</italic> [<italic>the litigants</italic>] <italic>did not accept them</italic> [<italic>to abide by their decision</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn104">21</xref></sup> <italic>and they are not recognized Mum&#x1E25;in</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn105">22</xref></sup> even [if] they are duly ordained in the Land of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn106">23</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] an admission of indebtedness made in their presence is regarded as an admission made outside the Court<sup><xref rid="fn107">24</xref></sup> and they [the litigants] may alter their [original] pleas which they put forth before them [the Judges].<sup><xref rid="fn108">25</xref></sup> One who denies aught before them [the Judges] and subsequently witnesses arrived [and refuted him], is not presumed to be a liar.<sup><xref rid="fn109">26</xref></sup> However, regarding the [Court which consists of] three [Judges], although they are not duly ordained, &#x2014; [the law is that] the admission of indebtedness made in their presence is regarded as one made before a competent Court of Law. Likewise, in [the case of] one who denies [aught] and subsequently witnesses came [and refuted him], &#x2014; he is presumed to be a liar and cannot amend his pleas.</p>
<p>3. Although one who is a recognized <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> is permitted to judge alone,<sup><xref rid="fn110">27</xref></sup> [nevertheless], it is a commandment of the Sages that he appoint others<sup><xref rid="fn111">28</xref></sup> to sit with him [in judgment].</p>
<p>4. Although a Court of Law of three is considered complete, &#x2014; [yet], whenever they [the Judges] are many it is regarded as praiseworthy and it is better that the law be decided<sup><xref rid="fn112">29</xref></sup> by eleven than by ten [Judges].<sup><xref rid="fn113">30</xref></sup> It is required that all who sit in the Court of Law<sup><xref rid="fn114">31</xref></sup> be scholars and worthy [of their office].<sup><xref rid="fn115">32</xref></sup> It is forbidden for a wise man to sit in judgment until he knows with whom he sits lest he sit with people who are not suitable<sup><xref rid="fn116">33</xref></sup> and is [then] found to be included in a council of conspirators<sup><xref rid="fn117">34</xref></sup> and not in a Court of Law. One who is not an authorized Judge [<italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic>] and the litigants did not accept him upon themselves,<sup><xref rid="fn118">35</xref></sup> although he obtained authorization from the Exilarch,<sup><xref rid="fn119">36</xref></sup> his decision is not binding,<sup><xref rid="fn120">37</xref></sup> even if he did not err [in his ruling],<sup><xref rid="fn121">38</xref></sup> and [consequently] each one of the litigants may, if he so desires, retract and plead [his case anew] before a [competent] Court of Law.<sup><xref rid="fn122">39</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Authorization which a ruler nowadays grants</italic> [<italic>to an individual Judge</italic>] <italic>is of no consequence</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn123">40</xref></sup> <italic>However, if the community accepted him in accord with the written decree of the ruler, he may act as Judge</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn124">41</xref></sup> <italic>And some say that if he</italic> [<italic>the Judge</italic>] <italic>is versed in law and possesses reasoning power, &#x2014; the ruler&#x2019;s authorization has legal effect for him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn125">42</xref></sup> <italic>or</italic> [<italic>likewise, the authorization of</italic>] <italic>the officer who was appointed in his town</italic> [<italic>has legal effect for him</italic>], &#x2014; <italic>for this comes under the category of the law of the State</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn126">43</xref></sup> [<italic>viz.</italic>,], <italic>to appoint</italic> [<italic>as</italic>] <italic>Judges and Magistrates whomever he desires</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn127">44</xref></sup> <italic>Nevertheless, whosoever does this without the permission of the community, annoys the general public</italic><sup><xref rid="fn128">45</xref></sup> <italic>and is destined to give an account</italic> [<italic>of his actions in the world to come</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn129">46</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn84">1) Mishna San. 2a and Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic> 2b-3a in accord with R. A&#x1E25;a, the son of R. Ika that Biblically even one is sufficient to judge monetary cases. Three, however, are required Rabbinically on account of idlers who are unversed in the law (v. <italic>Isserles</italic> anon). Thus also Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> II, 10 (v. <italic>Kesef Mishneh</italic> on the authority of <italic>RaShBA</italic>) and <italic>Asheri</italic> to San. I end <italic>contra &#x2018;Ir Shushan</italic> &#x2014; <italic>M.E. Ba&#x1E24;</italic> writes that in the first instance (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05DB;&#x05EA;&#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;</span>) three who are versed in the law are required. Regarding a city wherein all the inhabitants are unversed in the law, v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 8, 1, <italic>Gloss. ShaK</italic> defends <italic>&#x2018;Ir Shushan</italic> on the basis of the following text: San. 3a: &#x2018;Said Raba, . . cases of indebtedness require no <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> for the reason advanced by R. &#x1E24;anina (v. <italic>infra</italic>). R. A&#x1E25;a, the son of R. Ika states: Biblically even one individual is qualified to deal with cases of indebtedness, as it is written, <italic>In righteousness shalt</italic> thou <italic>judge thy neighbour</italic> (Lev. XIX, 5). Three judges are required on account of idlers who act as judges &#x2026; What is the difference between Raba and R. A&#x1E25;a, the son of R. Ika (since they both agree that laymen Judges are legally qualified to adjudicate monetary cases) ? &#x2014; They differ with respect to the opinion of Samuel who said: If two laymen Judges adjudicated a monetary case, their judgment holds good but they are called an arrogant court. Raba (who requires three Biblically) does not agree with Samuel; whereas R. A&#x1E25;a, does.&#x2019; Consequently, continues <italic>ShaK,</italic> since we do not rule in accordance with Samuel (v. <italic>infra</italic> par. 2 beg.), we must say that the law agrees with Raba, viz., that Biblically three <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> are necessary, for the term <italic>&#x2018;Elohim&#x2019;</italic> denoting <italic>&#x2018;Judges&#x2019;</italic> is found three times in Ex. XXII, 6-8 with respect to cases of larceny, and on the basis of the principle that there is <italic>&#x2018;an interweaving of Biblical sections&#x2019;</italic> <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05D1; &#x05E4;&#x05E8;&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span> (i.e., clauses of one section are taken over for interpretative purposes to a succeeding section, in this case the term <italic>&#x2018;Elohim&#x2019;</italic> is taken over to the section in Ex. XXII, 24 which deals with cases of indebtedness). Hence, three <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> Judges should be required even in cases of indebtedness. However, this requirement was relaxed and three laymen Judges suffice on account of the reason advanced by R. &#x1E24;anina, viz., &#x2018;in order not to close the door against borrowers&#x2019; (people would refuse to advance loans should they subsequently meet with difficulties in having to procure <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> Judges in order to collect their debts). This is also evident from <italic>Asheri,</italic> for he decides in favour of R. Abbahu that the adjudication of two Judges is invalid <italic>contra</italic> Samuel (v. <italic>supra</italic> this note). Furthermore, <italic>Asheri</italic> states explicitly that the law follows R. Abbahu since we have an established principle that beginning with Abaye and Raba the law always rests with the <italic>Later Authorities.</italic> Consequently, the law is decided in favour of Raba who disagrees with Samuel. Thus also <italic>Alfasi, RABaN</italic> and <italic>N.Yos. Maim.</italic> ruling (v. Yad <italic>ibid.</italic>) presents the following difficulties: a) On the one hand <italic>Maim.</italic> rules that three Judges are required and on the other hand, he states that one <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> is permitted to try monetary cases, which is in agreement with R. A&#x1E25;a. But, as we have seen above, R. A&#x1E25;a accepts Samuel&#x2019;s dictum, and such being the case, <italic>Maim.</italic> should likewise accept Samuel&#x2019;s ruling that two Judges are sufficient. The same difficulty is found in <italic>SeMaG.</italic> b) According to B.K. 84b and Git. 88b, the reason why we may adjudicate monetary cases nowadays is because we act as agents of the former authoritative Judges (<italic>Elohim</italic>). Thus also Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> V, 8 and <italic>SeMaG</italic> (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 1 notes). Hence, Biblically, monetary cases are tried by <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in,</italic> i.e., in accord with Raba, for according to R. A&#x1E25;a, one laymen Judge would be sufficient today (v. <italic>Kesef Mishneh</italic> to Yad, <italic>ibid.</italic> II, 10 who raises the same question and cites <italic>Resp.</italic> of <italic>RaShBA</italic> in order to remove the above difficulties. Cf. also <italic>Le&#x1E25;em Mishneh ibid.</italic>). <italic>ShaK</italic> writes that the solution of the latter authorities is strained. <italic>A.H.</italic> removes the above difficulties as follows: Samuel&#x2019;s dictum that &#x2018;If two judges tried monetary cases their decision holds good,&#x2019; <italic>refers only to Biblical adjudication.</italic> And needless to say that the one (R. A&#x1E25;a) who maintains that Biblically one Judge is qualified to try monetary cases will certainly hold that if two adjudicated the matter, their decision is valid and they are Biblically designated a Court of Law. However, Rabbinically, all agree that three Judges are required on account of idlers who are unversed in the law. This is what is meant by the text (v. <italic>supra</italic>), &#x2018;What is the difference between Raba and R. A&#x1E25;a? &#x2014; They differ with respect to the opinion of Samuel who said: &#x2018;If two Judges etc.,&#x2019; i.e., Biblically, the decision given by two judges is valid and they are designated a Court of Law according to Samuel. Therefore, the Gemara does not state that the difference between Raba and R. A&#x1E25;a centers around the difference of opinion between Samuel and R. Abbahu (the latter holding that the decision of two is invalid), for as far as a valid judgment is concerned, R. A&#x1E25;a and Samuel agree with R. Abbahu that three are required <italic>Rabbinically,</italic> on account of idlers. Samuel and R. A&#x1E25;a only differ Biblically.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn85">2) San. 2b-3a. V. previous note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn86">3) San. 3a. The expression, &#x2018;who has a knowledge of logical inferences in (civil) laws&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05E2; &#x05E1;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05EA; &#x05D1;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>) taken from <italic>Tur,</italic> is not equivalent to the Talmudic term <span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;</span>, i.e., one who has the capacity to reason even regarding matters concerning which he did not study. For this would be equivalent to a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> (authoritative Judge). V., Shab. 63a a.e. The expression used here has reference to one who merely received reasons for certain laws from others, but is himself not endowed with the power of reasoning &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> (v. also <italic>Perisha</italic>). <italic>ShaK</italic> agrees with <italic>M.E.</italic> regarding the term <span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;</span>, but maintains that one of the Judges must be versed in traditions (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;</span> used in San. <italic>ibid.</italic>). Thus also <italic>R. Meir of Padua contra Ba&#x1E24;</italic> who writes that <span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;</span> refers to partial knowledge. The ruling here, viz., that one is required to be versed in the law follows <italic>Asheri contra Mord.</italic> who requires the three Judges to be versed in the law even if they have no reasoning power. Thus also <italic>R. Zera&#x1E25;yah</italic> and <italic>N.</italic></ftnote>

Thus also <italic>Asheri</italic> and <italic>Sefer ha-Terumoth.</italic> Should there be a difference of opinion among the litigants as to the type of adjudication in the contested matter, one demanding that it should be tried by a judicial Court and the other maintaining that businessmen should be appointed to arbitrate the case, &#x2014; the law is that if the accepted local custom is to submit such a case to arbitration by businessmen, this custom should be followed since &#x2018;an accepted custom overrides a law&#x2019; (Y. Yeb. XII, 1(12c) ; Y. B.M. VII, 1(11b) ; Maseketh Soferim XIV, 18) &#x2014; <italic>R.A. Eger, P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn98">15) San. 2b in accord with R. Abbahu. Thus also <italic>Alfasi, Asheri</italic> and Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> II, 10. The following sources in Rabbinic literature indicate that R. Abbahu&#x2019;s view was the accepted law: San. 29b-30a: Regarding a deed of a debtor&#x2019;s admission of indebtedness in the presence of witnesses (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05D0;</span>) where it is taken for granted that the document was legally drawn up in the presence of a Court of three. Ket. 22a (cf. San. <italic>ibid.</italic>) : If one of the three Judges necessary for the authentication of signatures on documents (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05DD; &#x05E9;&#x05D8;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span>) died before signing it, the document should contain such wording. So too, in B.B. 165b. B.M. 31b: &#x2018;Go and bring three people in whose presence you made the division (of partnership).&#x2019; San. 2b-3a: Raba agrees with R. Abbahu that if two adjudicated a monetary case their decision is not binding. Thus also the opinion of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan and Resh Lakish in Y. San. I, 1(18a) cited by <italic>Tosaf.,</italic> San. 2b s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05D9; &#x05D4;&#x05DB;&#x05DC;</span>. <italic>Mord</italic>. a.o. write that even Samuel who regards the decision of two Judges binding (v. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1) will agree that in the cases of <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05D0;</span> (admission of indebtedness) and <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05DD; &#x05E9;&#x05D8;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span> (authentication of signatures) mentioned above, three Judges are required. As to the statement in San. 30 and parallel references, &#x2018;But perhaps the Rabbis of Rabbana Ashi&#x2019;s academy agreed with Samuel,&#x2019; &#x2014; it should be understood as refering to other cases of adjudication (v. <italic>Hag. Imre Baruk</italic>). This also follows from <italic>Alfasi</italic> and <italic>Maim.,</italic> the latter holding that even a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> is not qualified to deal alone in the above-mentioned matters, although in other cases he is qualified. <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic> writes that if two Judges adjudicated a monetary case and exacted money from one person and gave it to another person and the latter betrothed a woman with this money, &#x2014; we should be stringent and consider the marriage binding and in order to dissolve the marriage a <italic>Get</italic> (Bill of Divorce) is required. <italic>ShaK</italic> opposes <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic>&#x2019;s <italic>ruling.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn105">22) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Hence, if they are experts (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>), even if less than three, an admission of indebtedness made before them is considered valid. Thus <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>Asheri. Maim.,</italic> however, holds (Yad, <italic>ibid.</italic>) that even if they are experts and duly ordained, &#x2014; as long as they are less than three, an admission made before them is not binding. But if they are three, even laymen, it would be valid. This is the meaning of <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s statement, &#x2018;even if they are duly ordained,&#x2019; i.e., even if they are experts (although Yad has &#x2018;even if he is a rcognized <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh,</italic>&#x2019; it applies equally to two experts). Consequently, <italic>Isserles&#x2019; Gloss</italic> is difficult to comprehend, for it should have been stated as a dissenting opinion. Perhaps <italic>Isserles</italic> should be understood thus: &#x2018;and they are not Judges who are recognized by the public.&#x2019; But this is a strained interpretation &#x2014; <italic>M.E. ShaK</italic> rejects the interpretation of <italic>M.E.</italic> For even if the Judges are recognized by the public, their decision would still be invalid since they are less than three. The reason, therefore, why <italic>Isserles</italic> does not record this as a dissenting opinion is duel to the fact that the term &#x2018;duly ordained&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>) employed by <italic>Caro</italic> is unclear. For Judges may be duly ordained and yet not be experts (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>). V., <italic>Tur</italic> and <italic>Asheri infra</italic> &#x00A7; 25 that <italic>&#x2018;Ordination&#x2019;</italic> holds good even for a non-<italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh.</italic> The law, however, is that even if they are duly ordained and also experts, &#x2014; yet, if their number is less than three, an admission of indebtedness made in their presence is not binding (<italic>contra Isserles</italic>). Thus also <italic>&#x2018;Ir Shushan</italic> &#x2014; <italic>ShaK. A.H.</italic> rules that if the litigants accepted the Judges (although their number is less than three) or one Judge who was a recognized authority (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05D7; &#x05DC;&#x05E8;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>), e.g., if the people accepted a Rabbi to judge all monetary matters alone, the latter has the status of a Court of Law and an admission made in his presence is binding and the litigants cannot alter their original pleas. Likewise, one who denies aught in his presence and subsequently witnesses appeared and refuted his evidence, is presumed to be a liar even in the future (v. Sh. &#x2018;Ar. anon). So too, may this single Judge compel one to appear before him for judgment and may hear testimony, save that in one respect there is a difference between a single Judge and a Court of Law of three. For in the latter case, an admission made in their presence is regarded as an admission made in writing and another Court may adjudicate the matter in accordance with the testimony and the pleas heard by the first Court of three even if the testimony etc., is submitted by the first Court to the second Court in writing. But if one was accepted as the recognized authority, although, as stated above, an admission made in his presence is regarded as made before a Court of Law of three, and should he on the basis of the information he obtains, render a decision, it would be binding, &#x2014; yet, if after hearing the testimony and obtaining all the information in the case, &#x2014; for some reason, it is submitted to another Court for final adjudication, the evidence presented to the second Court for consideration is regarded as having the status of oral testimony offered by a witness testifying to what he has heard from an eye-witness&#x2019; (Bek. 36a a.e.) which is invalid. Consequently, the second Court cannot render a decision on the basis of the submitted evidence. And if this testimony is submitted in writing to the second Court, the latter would have to hear the evidence again directly from the contesting parties or the party that made the admission, for the law is that testimony must be offered by witnesses orally and not from their writing (derived from Deut. XIX, 15, <italic>At the mouth of two witnesses</italic> &#x2026; <italic>shall a matter be established</italic> &#x2014; Git. 71a). But if the single recognized authority completes the adjudication himself, his decision is as binding as the one given by a Court of three &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth</italic>. On testimony offered before a Court, v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 39, 12 and on the authentication of documents, v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 46, 4, <italic>Gloss</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn108">25) B.B. 31a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn109">26) B.M. 17a and <italic>Alfasi</italic> a.l. However, if he declared before them: &#x2018;You are my witnesses&#x2019; or he phrased his statement in the form of a complete admission, he is presumed to be a liar (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7;32, 1 and &#x00A7; 81) &#x2014; <italic>M.E. ShaK</italic> opposes <italic>M.E.</italic> and writes that even if he stated: &#x2018;You are my witnesses,&#x2019; they are still not regarded as a Court of Law, but only as witnesses. Hence, if he later alters his pleas and states, &#x2018;I paid you,&#x2019; he is not presumed to be a liar (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 79, 9). Cf. however, viewpoint of <italic>Nethiboth</italic> and <italic>A.H. supra</italic> n. 22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn110">27) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> II, 11 derived from Aboth IV, 8: &#x2018;Judge not alone.&#x2019; <italic>Maim.</italic> has the reading, &#x2018;One who was a recognized <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> or obtained permission (to judge) from the Court of Law.&#x2019; <italic>Tur</italic> has, &#x2018;An individual who obtained permission etc.&#x2019; On this ruling v. San. 5a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D2;&#x05D5;&#x05DF;</span>. Cf. however, Y. San. I, 1(18a): &#x2018;R. Abbahu was sitting alone in judgment in the <italic>Turbulent</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E8;&#x05D3;&#x05EA;&#x05D0;</span>. So <italic>Jastrow</italic>) Synagogue&#x2019; at Caesarea. Said his disciples to him, Rabbi, have you not taught us thus: Judge not alone? &#x2014; Said he to them, Since they (the people) see me sitting alone in judgment and yet come to see me (with their cases), it is as though they accepted me (to abide by my decision) and it has thus been taught: When does this apply (that one must not judge alone) ? &#x2014; If they did not accept him, but if they did accept (him), he may judge even alone.&#x2019; One should be careful nowadays not to judge alone even if the litigants accepted him to abide by his decisions, unless he expressly stated, &#x2018;I am not competent to judge matters of strict law (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05D4;</span>) and in case I give an erroneous decision, I am not to be held liable,&#x2019; or if it is a matter with which he is familiar and experienced &#x2014; <italic>ShaK. A.H.</italic> disagrees with <italic>ShaK</italic> and states that the above stipulation is unnecessary, for since everyone is aware that he is the only Judge in town, they rely upon his judgment. Hence, it is as though they accepted him to abide by his rulings even if he should give an erroneous decision.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn111">28) Thus Yad <italic>ibid. Tur</italic> has &#x2018;that he appoint another individual.&#x2019; V., <italic>Perisha.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn112">29) The translation follows <italic>Maim.</italic> and <italic>Tur</italic> who have <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05D7;&#x05EA;&#x05DA;</span> in the <italic>Niph&#x2018;al</italic> form. <italic>Caro</italic> has <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05D7;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05DA;</span> in the <italic>Kal</italic> which is incorrect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn113">30) San. 7b: &#x2018;Whenever a case was presented to R. Huna he used to call a meeting and gather ten scholars in order, as he put it, that each of them carry off a chip of the beam&#x2019; (i.e., share the responsibility with him). Thus also Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> II, 13 and <italic>Tur</italic> a.l. When the Judges are many, they all examine the case very carefully and there is a better chance for a correct decision to be reached. Actually the number ten mentioned here is inexact, for a Court of Law must not be comprised of an even number, for if their opinions were halved no decision could be reached. The number ten is mentioned because in the cited passage regarding R. Huna, he summoned ten scholars. However, there it means that he gathered ten authorities excluding himself &#x2014; <italic>M.E. Perisha.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn114">31) I.e., all those who sit in judgment, but regarding a disciple who sits before his master, it is not necessary that he be a scholar. As long as he is not an uncultured person, it is permissible &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn115">32) Sheb. 30b: &#x2018;Our Rabbis taught: Whence do we know that a Judge should not permit an uncultured disciple to sit before him (so that he should not be misled by his erroneous opinions)? &#x2014; For it is said, <italic>From a false matter keep far</italic>&#x2019; (Ex. XXIII, 7). Thus also Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXII, 2 and <italic>Tur</italic> a.l. Cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 7, 10; &#x00A7; 9, 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn116">33) San. 23a: &#x2018;The pure-minded of the people of Jerusalem would not act thus &#x2026; they would not sit in judgment unless they knew who was to sit with them.&#x2019; Thus also Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> II, 14 and <italic>Tur</italic> a.l.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn117">34) San. 26a (ref. to Is. VIII, 12) and as such cannot be included for the purpose of a decision. V., also Yad <italic>ibid</italic> and <italic>Tur</italic> a.l.</ftnote>

Derived from San. 6a. This has reference to one who is neither versed in the law nor possesses reasoning power. One who is versed in the law but does not possess the power of reasoning is regarded as a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> (authoritative Judge) and if he obtains authorization (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05D8;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05EA; &#x05E8;&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span>) his decision is binding.

<ftnote id="fn122">39) <italic>Tur</italic> has &#x2018;another Court of Law,&#x2019; which is incorrect, for this would imply that the first is also considered a valid Court of Law. <italic>Maim.</italic> and <italic>Caro</italic> after him omit the word <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D7;&#x05E8;</span> (another) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Cf. also <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s text <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 25, 4.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn130">1) B.K. 27b: &#x2018;It has been stated: Rab Judah said: A man may not take the law into his own hands in order to safeguard his interests. R. Na&#x1E25;man said: A man may take the law into his own hands for the sake of safeguarding his interests. Where there is an irretrievable loss pending, all the authorities agree that a man may take the law into his own hands in order to protect his interests. They differ only where there is no irretrievable loss pending. R. Judah holds that a man may not take the law into his own hands in order to protect his interests, for since no irretrievable loss is pending let him go to the Judge; whereas, R. Na&#x1E25;man maintains that a man may take the law into his own hands in order to safeguard his interests, for since he acts according to the law why should he trouble himself (to go to Court) ?&#x2019; The law is decided in favour of R. Na&#x1E25;man. Thus also Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> II, 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn131">2) B.K. <italic>ibid.</italic>: &#x2018;Ben Bag Bag stated: Do not enter (stealthily) thy neighbour&#x2019;s courtyard in order to take aught without his knowledge even if it belongs to you lest you will appear to him as a thief. You may, however, break his teeth and say to him (the alleged offender), I am taking possession of what is mine.&#x2019; This deals with a case where the loss is not an irretrievable one and supports R. Na&#x1E25;man&#x2019;s viewpoint. Furthermore, we might have thought that the legal principle, &#x2018;a man may take the law into his own hands&#x2019; applies only to a case where one comes to seize aught that is in the possession of another individual, in which case, the latter, in order to safeguard his interests may take the law into his own hands, but not so in the case where the article is already in the possession of the offender. Ben Bag Bag, therefore, in stating that a man has a right to say, &#x2018;I am taking possession of what is mine,&#x2019; informs us otherwise.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn132">3) V. previous note on Ben Bag Bag&#x2019;s view and B.K. 27b: Concerning R. &#x1E24;isda&#x2019;s query: &#x2018;What is the fine to be imposed in the case of one who wounds with the blade of a hoe or with the handle of the hoe? &#x2026; R. Na&#x1E25;man asked for the circumstances of the case &#x2026; There was a well that belonged to two persons, They used it on alternate days. One of them came and used it on a day that was not his. The other said to him: This day is mine&#x0021; But when the latter paid no attention, he took the blade of a hoe and struck him with it. R. Na&#x1E25;man replied : He ought to have given him a hundred blows with the hoe.&#x2019; Although this case would harmonize even with R. Judah&#x2019;s view (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 1) since it involved an irretrievable loss (for there would be no water left in the well by the time they go to Court), &#x2014; yet, we see that he was permitted to strike him, whence it follows that even according to the view that one may take the law into his own hands even where no irreparable loss is pending, he may also strike the offender.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn133">4) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Thus also <italic>Asheri.</italic> Derived from B.K. 27a in the case of the ox that threw himself on the back of another ox with the intention to kill, where it is pointed out that one may not cause damage to a <italic>tort-feasant</italic> animal if it was possible to save his own chattel otherwise, even where there is an irretrievable loss involved. Much more so in the case of striking an individual in order to protect one&#x2019;s interests where it is possible to do so without having to resort to bodily injury.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn134">5) B.K. 27b in accord with R. Na&#x1E25;man (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 1). <italic>Tur</italic> has, &#x2018;and if his opponent is dissatisfied with him and took him to law and they (the Judges) found that the claimant had acted in accordance with the law, they do not try his case again.&#x2019; This is explained by <italic>ShaK</italic> as follows: If his opponent states that he is prepared to go to law with him and to obey the Court&#x2019;s decision on the condition that the seized article be returned to him and that he will settle the case by making payment in another form, we do not try the case again, since the seizure was found to be legal.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn135">6) <italic>Tur</italic> and <italic>Asheri.</italic> Derived from B.K. 117a: &#x2018;Two people quarrelled about a net. One said, It is mine, and the other said, It is mine. One of them ultimately went and handed it over to the <italic>Parangaria</italic> (a public service) for confiscation. Said Abaye, he should have the right to plead, When I handed over the article it was my own property that I surrendered. Said Raba to him: <italic>Is he then believed if he says so?</italic> &#x2014; Raba therefore, said: We impose a ban upon him until he returns the net and appears before the Court.&#x2019; It follows that only if he were able to prove that it is his do we apply the principle, &#x2018;a man may take the law into his own hands.&#x2019; Otherwise not. V., also M.K. 17a where it is stated that &#x2018;a scholar may take the law into his own hands when he is absolutely certain as to the law,&#x2019; whence it follows that one who is not a scholar must be prepared to establish that it is definitely his. For if he cannot prove that the article is his, then not only is he forbidden to strike him and seize the article, but he is forbidden to take the article even without resorting to force. This is applicable only if he seizes the article in the presence of witnesses, but if there are no witnesses present, he may seize it, since then he would be believed before the Court on the principle of <italic>Miggo</italic> (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 1, n. 50) &#x2014; <italic>M.E., ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn136">7) For if he takes a pledge of him, he transgresses the negative precept, <italic>When thou dost lend thy neighbour any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his home to fetch his pledge</italic> (Deut. XXIV, 10). B.M. 113a: &#x2018;One who lends money to his fellow, may take a pledge of him (when the debt falls due) only through the Court.&#x2019; Not only is he prohibited to enter the debtor&#x2019;s home in order to seize the pledge, but even outside of the home it is permitted only for the Court officer to seize it forcibly according to Samuel (<italic>ibid.</italic>). If, however, the borrower denies the debt, the lender may seize the pledge without witnesses in order that he be believed on the principle of <italic>Miggo</italic> (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 6). For the reason why it is forbidden for him proper to seize the pledge is that he can seize the pledge through the Court, but in this case where he cannot collect it through Court, he may seize it himself (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 97, 15). Cf. also <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 61, 6. Thus <italic>Sha&#x2018;ar Mishpat. K.H.</italic> reject this &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn137">8) B.M. 115a: &#x2018;Our Rabbis taught: <italic>Thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge</italic>: You may not enter his (the debtor&#x2019;s) house, but you may enter the house of the surety (to seize for a debt), and so it is written, <italic>Take his garment that is surety for a stranger</italic> (Prov. XX, 16) ; also, <italic>My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, thou art snared with the words of thy mouth. Do this now, my son and deliver thyself when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself and make sure thy friend</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> VI, 1-3). Another interpretation: You may not enter his house, but you may enter (to distrain) for porterage fees, payment for hiring asses, the hotel bill etc.&#x2019; Hence we see that in the latter cases one may take the law into his own hands and seize even a pledge.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn138">9) V. <italic>supra</italic> n. 7. For the prohibition applies only to entering the debtor&#x2019;s home and seizing it directly from him forcibly, but if the pledge was already in the hand of the creditor as a deposit, or where he seizes it from another person, not from the debtor, it is permissible. Especially according to <italic>Tosaf.</italic> (B.M. 113a, s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DE;&#x05D0;</span>) who write that the prohibition against the creditor seizing forcibly from the debtor, even outside of the latter&#x2019;s home, is only a Rabbinical measure lest he seize in his (the debtor&#x2019;s) home. According to Zohar, <italic>Bamidbar</italic> 119a, it is forbidden to seize even a pledge that was deposited with the creditor (<italic>K.H.</italic>). <italic>R. Mena&#x1E25;em Azariah da Fano</italic> states that if the deposit preceded the loan, it is permissible to retain it &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn140">11) B.K. 27b in accord with Ben Bab Bag (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 2) whence we see that in the case of an article concerning which it is clearly evident that it belongs to him, he may enter and take it by force. It is clear that the article in question was stolen. The principle, &#x2018;a man may take the law into his own hands&#x2019; has reference only to a case where the person proper came to inflict damage intentionally, but does not refer to his chattel which does this without the owner&#x2019;s knowledge &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn141">12) I.e., it is permissible to withhold one from robbing him and if necessary, he may strike him. Derived from B.K. 27b regarding the case of the well (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 3).</ftnote>

III &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Derived from Ber. 5b: &#x2018;It once happened that four hundred casks of wine belonging to R. Huna turned sour. R. Judah, the brother of Sala, the Pious, and the other scholars &#x2026; went to visit him and said to him: The master ought to examine his deeds (perhaps your misfortune is a result of some sin). He said to them: Do you suspect me? They replied: Is the Holy One, Blessed be He, suspect of punishing without justice? &#x2014; He said to them: If somebody heard of anything against me, let him speak out. They replied: We heard that the master does not give his tenant his (lawful share in the) vine twigs. He replied: Does he leave me any? He steals them all&#x0021; They replied: This is exactly what people say, If you steal from a thief, you also have a taste of it.&#x2019; <italic>Mord</italic>. maintains that the sin of R. Huna was that he took the law into his own hands, and, though, a scholar may act so (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 6), yet, it applies only to an article which is absolutely his, but in a case where the claim has to be proved and collection has to be made (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05D5;&#x05E1;&#x05E8; &#x05D2;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D0;</span>), even a scholar (according to this interpretation) may not take the law into his own hands.</ftnote>

If he were able to save his article by other means but went to a heathen Court through which he obtained his article, and subsequently slanderized the offender, he must pay damages as in the case of an informer &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> Seizing forcibly in a doubtful case is not valid through a heathen Court (<italic>R.A.Eger</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn146">17) And acts as a Judge (v. <italic>MaHaRIK ibid.</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn147">18) <italic>MaHaRIK</italic> Rt. 161 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Derived from B.K. 27b concerning R. &#x1E24;isda&#x2019;s query (v. text <italic>supra</italic> n. 3), whence it follows that the principle, &#x2018;a man may take the law into his own hands&#x2019; refers only to a case where the claimant is certain that the article is his and may even resort to force in order to safeguard his interests. Consequently, seizing forcibly a pledge where both the Biblical prohibition <italic>Thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge</italic> (Deut. XXIV, 10) as well as the Rabbinical prohibition (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 9) do not enter, would be permissible under all conditions and would not come under the category of &#x2018;legal adjudication&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D0;</span>). Hence, the principle &#x2018;a man may take the law etc.,&#x2019; would not be applicable in such a case. For &#x2018;seizure&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;&#x05D4;</span>) without &#x2018;striking&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05DB;&#x05D0;&#x05D4;</span>) is not designated &#x2018;legal adjudication&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D0;</span>). This is substantiated by B.M. 115a (v. text <italic>supra</italic> n. 8). The latter text would present difficulties even according to R. Na&#x1E25;man (needless to say according to R. Judah), for as seen above, &#x2018;a man may take the law into his own hands&#x2019; is applicable only where the article is intact and is certainly his (the claimant&#x2019;s), but what is not specifically his does not come under this principle. Consequently, it may be asked how may the claimant enter the home of the surety etc., to take or seize an article which is not specifically his? However, if we say that seizure without striking is not &#x2018;legal adjudication,&#x2019; he may enter the home of the surety even against the latter&#x2019;s will, for this is not a case of taking the <italic>law</italic> into his own hands. As far as Ber. 5b (v. text <italic>supra</italic> n. 14) is concerned the vine twigs were taken by R. Huna not as &#x2018;seizure&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;&#x05D4;</span>), but rather as &#x2018;payment&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E9;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>), i.e., not with the intention to go subsequently to law. Hence, <italic>Isserles</italic> states here, &#x2018;and subsequently he goes down with him to Court,&#x2019; i.e., he may seize the pledge on the condition that he have the matter dealt with subsequently by the Court.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn148">19) V. M.K. 17a where it is stated that &#x2018;a scholar may take the law into his own hands where he is certain that it is his&#x2019; (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 6) although he may not be able to prove this before others. An entire community enjoys the status of a scholar in this respect. This is substantiated by B.B. 24b on the principle that &#x2018;a pot that belongs to two partners is neither warm nor cold,&#x2019; i.e., since the opinions of an entire community differ and each townsman would rely upon the other, the Rabbis were lenient with them and gave them the status of a scholar even if the individual townsman would suffer thereby. Furthermore, in the case of an entire community it is difficult to ascertain the matter, since they are all interested parties as in the case of a scholar who cannot ascertain his case before others being occupied with his learning. Consequently, the <italic>onus</italic> of proof rests upon the defendant. Cf. also B.B. 100a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn149">20) I.e., under the same ruler or government to whom they pay taxes (<italic>MaHaRIK</italic> Rt. 1). In Rt. 2, <italic>MaHaRIK</italic> states the reverse, viz., that even with respect to an individual who is not one of the townsman, the members of the community are also regarded as &#x2018;actual possessors&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05D7;&#x05D6;&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>). It is for this reason that <italic>Isserles</italic> does not state the law regarding one who is not a member of the community, for it seems that he is doubtful regarding this matter &#x2014; <italic>M.E. ShaK</italic>, however, writes that the townmen may take the law into their own hands only with respect to a member of their own community who is in conflict with them, but as far as the townsmen are concerned they are regarded as &#x2018;actual possesors&#x2019; even with regards to one who is not a member of their community. V., <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> for conflicting views in this matter. Also with respect to a pledge that has to be given by the individual to the community (v. <italic>Gloss</italic> anon) before going to Court, the law is that there is no difference between an individual from the same town or not &#x2014; <italic>W.G.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn150">21) <italic>RaShBA Resp.</italic> 27, s. 95 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn151">22) Members of a community are regarded as &#x2018;actual possessors&#x2019; only with respect to taxes (v. <italic>Gloss</italic> anon). Their power is derived from the ruler or governmnt since his security (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05E2;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;</span>), i.e., that everything stands pledged to the latter, takes precendence over all other securities. This is substantiated by B.B. 55a : &#x2018;If property is purchased by rich landlords (they paid to the government the tax on land, the owners of which were in arrears and thus became the owners of the land) who buy up land from the ruler or his servants and pay the tax on it, the sale is valid. This has reference, however, only to (land) which is transferred to the rich landlords because of the land tax, but if on account of the poll tax, then a purchase from them is not valid, because the poll tax is a personal liability. R. Huna, the son of R. Joshua said that even barley in the pot is seizable for the poll tax. R. Ashi said: Huna b. Nathan told me that Amram found that this view is untenable because if it were so, it would interfere with the law of the double portion to which a firstborn is entitled in the case of an inheritance (Deut. XXI, 17), for all the (inherited) property would thus become &#x2018;prospective&#x2019; (since all the property was seizable by the government on account of the poll tax) and (the law is that) a firstborn does not receive a double portion in prospective as in actual assets.&#x2019; The Gemara concludes that the father must have paid the land tax prior to his death thereby making his assets actual. Hence, we see that the tax collectors who are authorized by the government are considered &#x2018;actual possessors&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05D7;&#x05D6;&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>). V., <italic>Tosaf. ibid.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05DD; &#x05DB;&#x05DF;</span>. Thus also according to Yeb. 46a and <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D9; &#x05E0;&#x05E4;&#x05E7;&#x05D9;</span>. Consequently, the townsmen may say to the individual, &#x2018;Prove your case because it is the claimant that must produce evidence&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05E6;&#x05D9;&#x05D0; &#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;&#x05D5; &#x05E2;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05D5; &#x05D4;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05D4;</span>). And if he cannot produce evidence, they take an oath and are exempt, or if they wish, the individual takes the oath. However, the choice is in their hands as is the law of an &#x2018;actual possesor&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05D7;&#x05D6;&#x05E7;</span>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn152">23) <italic>Mord</italic>. to B.B. VI and II end &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Derived from B.B. 24b: &#x2018;Trees must be kept away a distance of twenty-five cubits from a town &#x2026; If the tree was there first, it is cut down but compensation must be given (Mishna). Gemara: Why cannot the owner of the tree say, Compensate me first and I will then cut it down? &#x2026; A pot with two cooks is neither hot nor cold&#x2019; (i.e., each townsman will wait for some other to compensate as a result of which the tree will still remain). Similarly, in the present case, the pledge must be given by the individual to the townsmen and the former becomes the claimant, otherwise the matter will be neglected.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn153">24) B.B. 24b: In the case of the tree which must be kept away from a town a distance of twenty-five feet cubits (v. previous note), the Mishna states that &#x2018;if the town was there first, the tree is cut down (by the townsmen) and no compensation is given. If the tree was there first, it is cut down and compensation is given. If there is a doubt which was there first, it is cut down and no compensation is given. Gemara asks : Why in the case of pit (<italic>ibid.</italic> 25b) is it stated that (in the case of a doubt whether the pit or the tree was there first) the tree is not cut down? &#x2014; With respect to pit it is stated that if the tree was certainly (there first) it is not cut down (contrary to the case of the tree that was there before the town was founded). Consequently, when there is a doubt we also do not say to him, Cut it down. However, in the present case even if the tree was there first it is cut down, consequently, if there is a doubt we also say to him, Cut it down. And should the question of compensation arise, we say to him, Produce evidence that it is yours (i.e., that the tree was there first) and take compensation.&#x2019; It follows therefrom that the fundamental reason for cutting down the tree in the case of doubt and not giving compensation is because it is obligatory to remove the tree and since we rule that even if it is certain that the tree was there first, it is cut down, consequently, the doubt remains only regarding the compensation and the townsmen are regarded as the &#x2018;actual possessors.&#x2019; Hence, only with respect to monetary matters do they enjoy the status of &#x2018;actual possessors,&#x2019; being empowered by the ruler or the government, but not in other matters.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn154">25) <italic>Terumath ha-Deshen</italic> s. 341 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> The pledge must be given by the individual even in a case where the community does not enjoy the status of a possessor, so that the individual should be the claimant.

It follows, therefore, that even if the townsmen have a claim against a student of the Torah, they are not regarded as &#x2018;actual possessors&#x2019; for a scholar is released Biblically from the ruler&#x2019;s obligation.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn157">1) Mishna Be&#x1E93;. 36b: &#x2018;None may judge&#x2019; (in a lawsuit) on the Sabbath or on a Festival.

The members of the <italic>Beth Din</italic> should be careful not to assemble on the Sabbath in the locale where they ordinarily conduct legal proceedings during weekdays lest it should appear that they are sitting in judgment (v. San. 88b where it is stated that on Sabbaths and Festivals the Great Sanhedrin did not meet in the Hall of Hewn stones but rather in the <italic>&#x1E24;el.</italic> Cf. <italic>Ba&#x2019;er Heteb</italic> to O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 339, n. 3) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> However, if this locale is also used as a meeting place for those who occupy themselves with the needs of the community, it is permissible, &#x2014; for the law is that one is permitted to devote himself to communal needs on the Sabbath (O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 306). On <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic> it is permissible to hold judicial sessions and to put the decision down in writing (O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 545, 5) &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn159">3) Y. San. IV, 7(22b) ; Y. Be&#x1E93;. V, 2(63a); Y. Ket. I, 1(24d) where it is stated that the Mishna in San. 32a: &#x2018;Capital cases are not tried on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival&#x2019; (since in case of condemnation the verdict must be carried out on the following day which is impossible were the trial to be held on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival. Moreover, it would be against the law to leave judgment in suspense until after the Sabbath or Festival &#x2014; San. 35a. Cf. M.K. 14b) implies that civil suits <italic>may</italic> be tried on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival. Hence, <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s ruling presents a difficulty. Y. (<italic>ibid.</italic>) therefore, explains that the prohibition against adjudication of civil suits on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival is merely a Rabbinical measure. Thus also Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XI, 3; <italic>Alfasi</italic> and <italic>Asheri</italic> to San. <italic>ibid.</italic> Even if the litigants agreed to appear before the Judges on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival, the prohibition still stands. For the Judges must be deliberate in judgment and since they are busy preparing for the Sabbath or Festival, this is not possible (<italic>contra &#x2018;Ir Shushan</italic> who writes that the reason is that the people are busy making the festive preparations and should therefore, not be summoned then). This is substantiated by <italic>Isserles&#x2019; Gloss</italic> (anon), &#x2018;but where a prohibition is involved (e.g., divorce or <italic>&#x1E24;alizah</italic> proceedings) the lenient view should not be adopted&#x2019; and in <italic>D.M., Isserles</italic> adds, &#x2018;for they (the Judges) are busy with the Sabbath preparations and cannot be deliberate in judgment.&#x2019; Thus we see that it is on account of the preoccupation of the Judges. This applies only to adjudication, but as regards hearing the pleas of the litigants and issuing the verdict after the Sabbath or Festival, it would be permissible from the Judges&#x2019; standpoint to meet for this purpose on the eve of the Sabbath or Festival (Thus <italic>RaN</italic> to Ket. beg.). The litigants, however, cannot be compelled to appear. This is the meaning of the following statement of <italic>Caro</italic>, &#x2018;If they summoned a litigant to appear . . he is not obliged to come,&#x2019; i.e., even if the summons was for the purpose of hearing the pleas only, or it may mean that even if the Judges are free (e.g., others make the festive preparations for them), yet, the litigants cannot be compelled to appear &#x2014; <italic>M.E. Nethiboth</italic>, however, maintains that if the litigants are willing to accept the verdict even if it is erroneous, the Judges may try their case even on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn160">4) B.K. 113a; Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXV, 9. V., end of previous note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn161">5) B.K. <italic>ibid.</italic> For he may offer the reason that he was busy preparing for the Sabbath or the Festival and did not take notice of the summons (Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E., ShaK</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn162">6) For throughout the week if they should have to appear in Court, the study of the Torah would be neglected. Hence, on the eve of the Sabbath or Festival when they are free from teaching, it is their only opportunity to appear in Court, if necessary. Hence, if the <italic>Beth Din</italic> finds it necessary to adjudicate cases on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival, it is permissible. A substantiation for this leniency may be derived from the following Mishna San. 24a: &#x2018;If one (of the contesting parties) said to the other: I accept my father or your father as trustworthy (to act as a Judge), or I accept three herdsmen as trustworthy, R. Meir says, He may (subsequently) retract; but the Sages say, He cannot retract.&#x2019; The law is in accord with the Sages, viz., that he cannot retract. It follows therefrom that no prohibition exists against a <italic>Beth Din</italic> which is Biblically ineligible to adjudicate the case, provided the litigants agreed to accept the ineligible Judges. This applies, of course, to a community where no eligible Judges are available, and such a <italic>Beth Din</italic> is valid under the circumstances (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 8, 1; &#x00A7; 22, 1). This is binding only in civil lawsuits, but not where a prohibition is involved. Hence, the ruling of <italic>Isserles</italic> anon &#x2014; <italic>W.G.</italic> (in accord with interpretation of <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu</italic>).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn166">10) B.K. 113a. I.e., until after the Festival because one is then busy on account of the Holidays (according to <italic>Rashi</italic> because it is the agricultural season). But after the Festival a date may be fixed. The reason mentioned <italic>supra</italic> n. 5 does not apply here since there was ample time for him to take notice of the summons. Thus <italic>Isserles</italic> anon &#x2014; <italic>ShaK</italic>. In the month of <italic>Sivan</italic> it would be permissible to summon one to Court because <italic>Shabuoth</italic> which occurs in this month consists only of two days in the Diaspora (and one day in the Land of Israel) and the question of preoccupation does not apply. On the eve of <italic>Shabuoth</italic> it would still be forbidden for the reasons stated above &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Some authorities, <italic>contra ShaK</italic>, forbid the entire months of <italic>Nisan</italic> and <italic>Tishri</italic>. There are twenty-one days during which a Groom should not be summoned to appear in Court, viz., seven days prior to the wedding; the seven days of the wedding-feast; seven days following the wedding-feast. Other authorities hold that a Groom should not be summoned only three days before and seven days after the wedding. A widower who marries a widow is not to be summoned during the three days after the marriage (E.H. &#x00A7; 64). In other cases of religious duties, e.g., a circumcision, the <italic>Sandek</italic> or the father of the child, should they have to appear in Court, the days to be fixed for the hearing should be left to the discretion of the Judges &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn167">11) But a resident in the same town may be judged.

M.K. II, 11) that monetary cases are dealt with by the Courts during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>. This refers to a litigant who lives in the same town and consequently, may be tried even against his will. B.K. 113a, the source of <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s ruling deals with a litigant who came from another town.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn168">12) B.K. <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn169">13) V. <italic>Tur</italic> and <italic>Sh. &#x2018;Ar.</italic> O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 546, 11: &#x2018;One is permitted to bring charges (against his fellow) on account of debts (owing to him) on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed.</italic>&#x2019; Thus <italic>Caro</italic>. But <italic>Isserles</italic> does not make any comment (<italic>ibid.</italic>) as in the present ruling, although <italic>Mord</italic>. is the source of the ruling in O.&#x1E24;. too. It is quite possible that <italic>Caro</italic> in O.&#x1E24;. is dealing with a case where it is permissible to bring charges in the month of <italic>Nisan, e.g.</italic>, where the accused was one of the townsmen or there was deliberate postponement and deception on the part of the accused party, in which case as stated here, it is permissible. Hence, in O.&#x1E24;. under the above conditions, it is not forbidden to bring charges &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> This interpretation is questioned by <italic>Ba&#x2019;er Heteb</italic> a.l., for <italic>Isserles</italic> states here that even villagers who came from out of town are not to be tried whence we infer that much more so in the case of residents is this forbidden. <italic>M.E.</italic> may, however, be defended for in O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 539, 3 <italic>Isserles</italic> does comment, viz., <italic>&#x2018;He is permitted to bring charges</italic> (against his fellow) <italic>in</italic> (the place of) <italic>judgment on account of his debts.&#x2019; M.Abr.</italic> rejects the interpretation of <italic>M.E.</italic>, for in O.&#x1E24;. we deal with bringing charges before a heathen Court, which is permissible during the Festival. This is what is meant by the term <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E9;&#x05E4;&#x05D8;</span> (&#x2018;in the place of judgment&#x2019;) employed in O.&#x1E24;. <italic>M.E.</italic> is defended by <italic>Shebuth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> because <italic>M.E.</italic> refers to &#x00A7; 546 where <italic>Caro</italic> states the law without using the term <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E9;&#x05E4;&#x05D8;</span> (&#x2018;in the place of judgment&#x2019;), i.e., even before a Jewish Court. <italic>Ma&#x1E25;a&#x1E93;ith ha-Shekel</italic> and <italic>Peri Megadim</italic> defend <italic>M.Abr.</italic> for in O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 546 too, the source is <italic>Mord. Tummim</italic> makes the following distinction: In the present ruling we deal with a case of one who not only brings charges against his fellow but also, demands that the matter be adjudicated, which is forbidden during this period; whereas in O.&#x1E24;. we deal with a case where the plaintiff demands payment and refers to a matter which is not contested by the accused party. Hence, it is permissible to be done on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic> &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn170">14) <italic>Mord</italic>. to B.K. X beg. and <italic>Hag. Maim.</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> B.K. 113a: &#x2018;R. Na&#x1E25;man said: We never summon the participants of the <italic>Kallah</italic> (the assembly of Babylonian students in the months of <italic>Elul</italic> and <italic>Adar</italic>) to appear in Court during the period of the <italic>Kallah</italic> or the participants of the Festival sessions which are held during the festive season (which begins thirty days prior to the Festival). When plaintiffs would come before R. Na&#x1E25;man (and requested that summonses be issued during this season) he would say to them: Have I assembled them for your individual benefit? But now that there are impostors (who take advantage of this privilege) there is apprehension (that they came to the assemblies for the sake of avoiding justice) &#x0021;&#x2019; The last part of this statement, &#x2018;and now that there are impostors&#x2019; is explained by <italic>Mord</italic>. to mean that we investigate the matter in order to determine whether there is a deliberate postponement or deception on their part in order to avoid justice. Hence, if we discover that this is really the case, we do fix a date for them to appear in Court during the <italic>Kallah</italic> and the festive sessions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn171">15) I.e., during <italic>Nisan</italic> and <italic>Tishri</italic>. Although according to the reasons mentioned above for not summoning one to a judicial session during <italic>Nisan</italic> or <italic>Tishri</italic> there is actually no difference between the commencement of the trial or the conclusion thereof, yet, there is support for the custom mentioned here, in Mishna Shab. 9a: &#x2018;If they began, they need not interrupt.&#x2019; Cf. also anon: &#x2018;We do not try cases at night &#x2026; but if they had begun to try monetary cases during the day, they may conclude at night.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn172">16) <italic>Decisions of Isserlein</italic> s. 207 &#x2014; <italic>G</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn173">17) Mishna San. 32a. Gemara (<italic>ibid.</italic> 34b) : &#x2018;Whence is this derived? R. &#x1E24;iyya b. Papa said: From the verse, <italic>And let them judge the people at all times</italic> (Ex. XVIII, 22 i.e., even at night). If this is the case, then even the commencement of the trial may (be held at night) &#x2014; It is as Raba expounded. For Raba pointed out an incongruity (between two verses) : It is written, <italic>And let them judge the people at all times</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic>); but elsewhere it is written, <italic>And in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit</italic> (Deut. XXI, 16. Here <italic>day</italic> is emphasized whence it follows that not only cases of inheritance must be decided by day but likewise all civil claims. Hence, this verse contradicts the preceding one). How now is this (reconciled)? &#x2014; The day is for the commencement of the trial, the night for the conclusion of the trial&#x2019; (for, <italic>and they shall judge &#x2026; at all times</italic> implies rendering judgment which is the essential factor). In <italic>Resp.</italic> of <italic>Isserles</italic> he writes that if the contesting parties agreed to be judged at night, it is permissible to do so, for this should not be regarded different from a case where the litigants accepted as Judge a relative or one who is ineligible. For this reason we adopt the lenient practice nowadays to judge at night, for when the parties appear for trial and come willingly, it is regarded as though they accepted him. Hence, the proceedings may be held at night. Thus <italic>M.E. P.Tesh</italic> cites dissenting opinions. <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s ruling that &#x2018;they may conclude at night&#x2019; has reference to cases where there was not enough time to complete the proceedings during the day &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>.</ftnote>

Yeb. 103b, s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E8; &#x05DD;&#x05DB;&#x05E8;</span> emends text of Y., whence it follows that only the conclusion of the trial may be held at night but not the commencement of the trial. Hence, emended text of Y. according to <italic>Tosaf.</italic> corresponds to Babli San. 34b (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 17). Cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 28, 24; San. 11b: The sanctification of the month must take place during the day. This is based on the verse, <italic>For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the G-d of Jacob</italic>. Thus we see that the sanctification of the month is equated to <italic>Judgment</italic> which is executed during the day. <italic>ShaK</italic> rules, <italic>contra</italic> the present ruling that if the entire legal proceedings were conducted at night, the decision is not valid.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn175">19) Shab. 10a: &#x2018;Until when do they sit in judgment? &#x2014; R. Shesheth said until mealtime. R. &#x1E24;ama said, Which Biblical verse (teaches this) ? &#x2014; For it is written, <italic>Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning&#x0021; Happy art thou O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength and not for drunkenness&#x0021;</italic> (Eccl.

Cf. however, M.K. 14b. <italic>Tur</italic> at the head of this chapter adds, that originally it was enacted by Ezra, the Scribe, that Courts hold their sessions on Mondays and Thursdays (B.K. 82a) for then people were present since they came to read the Torah.

Huna were sitting in judgment all day and their hearts grew faint (<italic>Rashi</italic>: they were distressed at not being able to study. Or because they were famished), (whereupon) R. &#x1E24;iyya b. Rab of Difta expounded to them, <italic>and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening</italic> (Ex. XVIII, 13) ; Can it really enter your mind that Moses sat and judged the entire day? When was his learning done? But this teaches you, Every Judge who judges in complete truth even for one hour, the Bible text credits him as though he had become a partner to the Holy One, blessed be He, in the act of creation. Here it is written, <italic>and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening</italic>, and elsewhere it is written, <italic>and there was morning and there was evening one day</italic> (Gen.

<ftnote id="fn177">21) Mishna Shab. 9b in accord with R. A&#x1E25;a b.

Thus also Yad, <italic>Tefillah</italic> VI, 5. According to <italic>Rashi ibid.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E0;&#x05D7;&#x05D4; &#x05D2;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;</span>, the major <italic>Min&#x1E25;a</italic> begins from six and a half hours and onwards (assuming that the day begins at 6:00 a.m. and ends at 6:00 p.m. An &#x2018;hour&#x2019; means a twelfth part of the day), i.e., from 12:30 p.m. The expression &#x2018;close to&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DD;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05DA;</span>) used in Mishna <italic>ibid.</italic> means half an hour before the appointed time.

Hence, the same applies to the major <italic>Min&#x1E25;a</italic> which begins from six and half hours and onwards. Cf. also <italic>ibid</italic> 100b and v.

Consequently, we do not sit in judgment from the beginning of the seventh hour. Legally the beginning of the seventh hour (12 noon) is the time for reciting <italic>Min&#x1E25;a</italic> (v. O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 232, 2), only that the Sages ordained to wait an additional half an hour in order to make certain that the sun is beginning to decline, for otherwise one may err with respect to the end of the sixth and the beginning of the seventh hour &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 6: FOR WHAT AMOUNT OF CLAIM SHOULD A JUDICIAL SESSION BE HELD? Contains one paragraph.</title>
<p>1. The Judges do not hold a judicial session [on account of a claim] less than a <italic>Perutah&#x2019;s</italic> worth.<sup><xref rid="fn183">1</xref></sup> However, if they met [on account of a claim of] a <italic>Perutah&#x2019;s</italic> worth, they may conclude their trial even for [a claim] less than a <italic>Perutah&#x2019;s</italic> worth.<sup><xref rid="fn184">2</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn183">1) B.M. 55a: &#x2018;Levi taught in his Baraitha collection &#x2026; A Court session is convened on account of a <italic>Perutah&#x2019;s</italic> worth&#x2019; (If one admits liability or there are witnesses to substantiate this admission, and payment is nevertheless refused, a Court session may be held in order to compel the debtor to pay). For in the case of robbery of less than a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth, it is not considered &#x2018;money&#x2019; (Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> In the case of a claim of vessels, however, the Court meets even if less than a <italic>Perutah&#x2019;s</italic> worth is involved. V., <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 88, 3. Thus also <italic>RaN</italic> to Sheb. VI, <italic>R. Yeru&#x1E25;am; Maim</italic>. Yad, <italic>To&#x2018;en we-Nit&#x2018;an</italic> III, 5. Others oppose this view and maintain that even in the case of vessels a Court session meets only when at least a <italic>Perutah&#x2019;s</italic> worth is involved, for less than that is not considered &#x2018;money&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>ShaK. Tummim</italic> states that <italic>Shitah Mekube&#x1E93;eth</italic> writes on the authority of <italic>RITBA</italic> (to B.M. <italic>ibid.</italic>) that if the claim concerns an object that is still extant, a Court session may meet for this purpose, even if it involves a claim of less than a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth. It is only when payment is demanded that it must involve at least a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth. In the case of two partners who have a claim against an individual in the amount of a <italic>Perutah</italic>, the law is that although the claim involves only half a <italic>Perutah</italic> with respect to each partner, yet, since the claim of the partners as a whole involves at least a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth, we may hold a Court session therefor. This would not apply to two individuals (not partners) who together have a claim of a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth against the same party &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh., A.H.</italic> If one person has a claim of a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth against two people, a judicial session may be held therefor, since with respect to the plaintiff the claim is regarded as &#x2018;money&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> If the Court held a session for a claim that involved less than a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth, such Court has the jurisdiction of a <italic>Beth Din</italic> insofar as admissions made in their presence are considered binding. Likewise with respect to one who was found to be a liar at such a session, the law is that he remains under such presumption &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn184">2) <italic>Tur</italic> citing <italic>Maim.</italic> Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XX, 11 in accord with R. Kattina (B.M. <italic>ibid.</italic>): &#x2018;The above text states: R. Kattina said: The Court holds sessions even for less than a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth. Raba raised an objection: <italic>And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing</italic> (Lev. V, 16), this (redundant <italic>and</italic>) extends the law of making amends even to less than a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth. Hence, it applies only to <italic>Hekdesh</italic> but not to <italic>&#x1E24;ullin&#x0021;</italic> (i.e., only in the case of sacred objects amends should be made even regarding less than a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth, but not in secular objects. In the latter case one may be compelled to restore aught that involves at least a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth) &#x2014; But if it was said, it was said thus: R. Kattina stated, If the Court met for a claim of a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth, they may conclude (the case) even for less (i.e., if for some reason the claim was reduced to less than a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth), (because) at the commencement of the trial a <italic>Perutah</italic> must be involved, but at the conclusion a (claim of a) <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth is not necessary.&#x2019; This latter statement viz., that &#x2018;at the commencement of the trial &#x2026; not necessary,&#x2019; should be understood as follows: Even if the defendant after the verdict is rendered puts forth a claim against the plaintiff which involves less than a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth, the Judges may conclude the trial even for this amount, the reason being that it is all regarded as one trial, for if the defendant is legally proven to be justified in his claim, he may deduct whatever is owing to him from the plaintiff&#x2019;s claim. Thus <italic>Rashi ibid.</italic> and <italic>Kesef Mishneh</italic> to Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> It is for this reason that <italic>Caro</italic> in the present ruling states, &#x2018;and they may conclude <italic>their</italic> trial,&#x2019; whereas <italic>Maim. ibid.</italic> has &#x2018;and they may conclude <italic>his</italic> trial&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> V., B.M. <italic>ibid., Tosaf</italic>. s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05EA;&#x05E0;&#x05D0; &#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05D3;&#x05DF;</span>; <italic>W.G.</italic> and <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu</italic> a.l. <italic>M.E.</italic> adopts the ruling of <italic>Asheri contra Maim.</italic>, that even if they hold a session for a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth, they may not conclude the proceedings for less than a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth. If for some reason the plaintiff&#x2019;s original claim is reduced to less than a <italic>Perutah</italic> and at the conclusion of the trial the plaintiff puts forth another claim of less than a <italic>Perutah</italic>&#x2019;s worth, according to some, even <italic>Asheri</italic> will hold that the trial may be concluded, because both claims are combined. <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic>, however, disagrees with this &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 7: WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO JUDGE AND THOSE WHO ARE UNFIT ON ACCOUNT OF ENMITY OR ON ACCOUNT OF KINSHIP. Contains twelve paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. A Court of three [Judges] of which one was a proselyte is unfit to judge a fellow Israelite<sup><xref rid="fn185">1</xref></sup> unless his<sup><xref rid="fn186">2</xref></sup> mother<sup><xref rid="fn187">3</xref></sup> <italic>or his</italic><sup><xref rid="fn186">2</xref></sup> <italic>father</italic><sup><xref rid="fn188">4</xref></sup> were Israelitish. A proselyte may, however, judge his fellow proselyte<sup><xref rid="fn189">5</xref></sup> although his<sup><xref rid="fn186">2</xref></sup> mother is not an Israelitish woman.<sup><xref rid="fn190">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. [A Judge who genealogically is] a bastard<sup><xref rid="fn191">7</xref></sup> and even if the three of them [who comprise the Court] are bastards, they are eligible to act as Judges<sup><xref rid="fn192">8</xref></sup> for everyone.<sup><xref rid="fn193">9</xref></sup> Thus also if each one of them was blind in one of his eyes, he is eligible [to act as Judge].<sup><xref rid="fn194">10</xref></sup> However, one who is blind in both his eyes is ineligible [to act as Judge].<sup><xref rid="fn195">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. Some say that one is fit to judge only from the age of eighteen and onwards,<sup><xref rid="fn196">12</xref></sup> and [provided] he has grown two pubic hairs.<sup><xref rid="fn197">13</xref></sup> And some say that from the age of thirteen years [plus one day] and onwards, one is eligible to judge, even if he has not grown two pubic hairs.<sup><xref rid="fn198">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. A woman is ineligible to judge.<sup><xref rid="fn199">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. Some say that those who are under the influence of wine are permitted to adjudicate civil suits.<sup><xref rid="fn200">16</xref></sup> A witness may not act as a Judge.<sup><xref rid="fn201">17</xref></sup> [This applies] only [to] a witness who testifies, e.g., if one of the Judges testified<sup><xref rid="fn202">18</xref></sup> before his colleagues<sup><xref rid="fn203">19</xref></sup> about a [certain] incident which he beheld, he cannot be combined with them to hold a judicial session regarding that incident.<sup><xref rid="fn204">20</xref></sup> However, if he does not testify, e.g., [in a case] where the three Judges beheld the incident,<sup><xref rid="fn205">21</xref></sup> even if they beheld [the incident] with the express intent to be designated as testimony,<sup><xref rid="fn205">21</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] if they beheld it during the day,<sup><xref rid="fn206">22</xref></sup> they may act as Judges and may hold a judicial session concerning that incident;<sup><xref rid="fn207">23</xref></sup> but if they beheld it at night,<sup><xref rid="fn208">24</xref></sup> they may not hold a judicial session on [the strength of] their own evidence.<sup><xref rid="fn209">25</xref></sup> However, on [the strength of] evidence given by others they may act as Judges.<sup><xref rid="fn210">26</xref></sup> But if they were [originally] ordered to act as witnesses [in a certain matter, &#x2014; then] even on [the strength of] evidence given by others, they may not act as Judges.<sup><xref rid="fn211">27</xref></sup> Some say, however, that even if they were [originally] ordered to act as witnesses [in a certain matter], they may act as Judges on [the strength of] evidence given by others.<sup><xref rid="fn212">28</xref></sup> <italic>This entire</italic> [<italic>ruling</italic>] <italic>applies to a Biblical Law</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn213">29</xref></sup> <italic>but in</italic> [<italic>the case of</italic>] <italic>a Rabbinic matter</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn214">30</xref></sup> [<italic>the law is that even</italic>] <italic>a witness</italic> [<italic>who testified</italic>] <italic>may act as a Judge</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn215">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. [With respect to] one who is summoned to be tried before a Judge who is inferior to him [in learning, &#x2014; the law is that] the Judge [who summoned him to appear in Court] cannot compel him to go [and be tried] before him, but they call a meeting of the scholars who are [present] there and look into the matter among themselves.<sup><xref rid="fn216">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. It is forbidden for an individual [who is a Judge] to try one who is his friend,<sup><xref rid="fn217">33</xref></sup> although he is not his groomsman<sup><xref rid="fn218">34</xref></sup> or his companion whom [he loves] as his own self,<sup><xref rid="fn219">35</xref></sup> or one whom he hates,<sup><xref rid="fn217">33</xref></sup> although he is not his enemy nor does he seek his harm.<sup><xref rid="fn220">36</xref></sup> But it is necessary that both litigants should be equal in the eyes of the Judges and in their heart.<sup><xref rid="fn221">37</xref></sup> And if the [Judge] did not personally know either of them at all nor [each] one&#x2019;s doings, there is no more righteous Judge than he.<sup><xref rid="fn222">38</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>But if they had</italic> [<italic>already</italic>] <italic>tried</italic> [<italic>the case of a friend or enemy</italic>] <italic>their decision is binding</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn223">39</xref></sup> <italic>Some, however, say that in</italic> [<italic>the case of</italic>] <italic>one&#x2019;s real enemy, i.e., one to whom he has not spoken for three days out of enmity, or his real friend, i.e., one&#x2019;s groomsman and companion</italic>, &#x2014; [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>their decision is not binding</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn224">40</xref></sup> <italic>Still others say that whoever is not his real friend or enemy, he is permitted to judge, and it is considered merely a measure of piety</italic><sup><xref rid="fn225">41</xref></sup> <italic>to adopt a stringent view not to judge him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn226">42</xref></sup> <italic>Therefore, one is permitted to be a Judge when each</italic> [<italic>litigant</italic>] <italic>chooses one Judge</italic> [<italic>and the two Judges jointly choose the third</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn227">43</xref></sup> <italic>because each</italic> [<italic>litigant</italic>] <italic>chooses his friend;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn228">44</xref></sup> <italic>and much more so that a teacher can be a Judge for his disciple</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn229">45</xref></sup> <italic>And even a Court that is unfit to judge on account of friendship or enmity can appoint other eligible Judges</italic> [<italic>in order</italic>] <italic>that they adjudicate</italic> [<italic>the case in question</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn230">46</xref></sup> <italic>One who makes a statement concerning a Judge that he is his enemy or a friend of his opponent, is not believed, and he is required</italic> [<italic>to adduce</italic>] <italic>proof</italic> [<italic>in order to substantiate</italic>] <italic>his words</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn231">47</xref></sup> [<italic>A Judge</italic>] <italic>who pronounces a ban against a fellow because</italic> [<italic>the latter</italic>] <italic>treated him disrespectfully, can</italic> [<italic>nevertheless</italic>] <italic>act as his Judge subsequently, since he is not</italic> [<italic>regarded thereby</italic>] <italic>his enemy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn232">48</xref></sup> <italic>V., infra &#x00A7; 33, 6</italic>.</p>
<p>8. Two scholars who hate each other, are forbidden to sit together in judgment, for on account of the enmity that [exists] between them, each one&#x2019;s mind [is inclined] to reverse the words of his colleague.<sup><xref rid="fn233">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. All those who are ineligible <italic>to testify</italic> on account of kinship,<sup><xref rid="fn234">50</xref></sup> or on account of sin, are ineligible to judge.<sup><xref rid="fn235">52</xref></sup> <italic>V., infra &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 33 and 34</italic> [<italic>regarding</italic>] <italic>the detailed laws of ineligible persons with respect to testimony and the same applies to adjudication</italic>, [<italic>viz.</italic>,] <italic>that the Judges should not be related to each other nor to the witnesses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn236">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. A Judge who knows his colleague to be a robber or a wicked man, should not join with him.<sup><xref rid="fn237">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. [With respect to the members of] a Court of three, it is necessary that each one of them should possess seven [characteristic] things, [viz.,] wisdom, humility, fear [of G-d], averseness to money [acquired illegitimately],<sup><xref rid="fn238">55</xref></sup>, love of truth, love [manifested] towards them by [fellow] creatures<sup><xref rid="fn239">56</xref></sup> [and] possessed of a good name.<sup><xref rid="fn240">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. Every case concerning which there results indirect benefit to the Judge, he [the Judge] cannot adjudicate. Therefore, [if] a Torah scroll belonging to the townspeople has been stolen, he [the alleged culprit] is not tried by the Judges of that town,<sup><xref rid="fn241">58</xref></sup> unless they have another Torah scroll.<sup><xref rid="fn242">59</xref></sup> And [likewise,] one who says, &#x2018;Distribute a <italic>Maneh</italic> to the poor of my town,&#x2019; [and it was stolen, &#x2014; the alleged culprti] is not tried by the Judges of that town.<sup><xref rid="fn243">60</xref></sup> <italic>V., supra &#x00A7; 4 that if one takes possession of aught that belongs to them</italic> [<italic>the towns-people</italic>] <italic>they may take the law into their own hands. V., infra &#x00A7; 37, par. 19 and par. 20 concerning these laws</italic>. Consequently, taxation disputes are not tried by the Judges of that town, because they [the Judges] or their relatives have an interest therein,<sup><xref rid="fn244">61</xref></sup> <italic>but if it is a</italic> [<italic>dispute concerning a</italic>] <italic>special tax, e.g.</italic>, [<italic>an assessment</italic>] <italic>that obtains only at a fixed time</italic>,&#x2014; [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>some</italic> [<italic>inhabitants</italic>] <italic>of the community</italic><sup><xref rid="fn245">62</xref></sup> <italic>can renounce their share</italic> [<italic>in this special tax</italic>] <italic>so that they derive no benefit therefrom. And</italic> [<italic>consequently</italic>,] <italic>they may adjudicate</italic> [<italic>the case</italic>]. <italic>Asheri</italic> [<italic>in</italic>] <italic>Resp. 26, s. 18 writes that</italic> [<italic>renunciation</italic>] <italic>has no legal effect and</italic> [<italic>yet in</italic>] <italic>rule 99 he states that</italic> [<italic>renunciation does have a legal effect. Hence, we must make a distinction between a special tax</italic> [<italic>where renunciation is legally binding</italic><sup><xref rid="fn245">62</xref></sup> <italic>and a permanent tax where renunciation has no legal effect</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn246">63</xref></sup> However, if they made an ordinance,<sup><xref rid="fn247">64</xref></sup> or there is a prevailing custom in town<sup><xref rid="fn248">65</xref></sup> that the Judges of the town should also try cases pertaining to taxation disputes, their decision is binding.<sup><xref rid="fn249">66</xref></sup></p>

XXIX, 4); only when set <italic>over thee</italic> must he be <italic>one from among thy brethren</italic>, but a proselyte may judge his fellow proselyte.&#x2019; <italic>Rashi</italic> explains this passage as referring to capital cases, for as far as civil suits are concerned, a proselyte may judge even Israelites according to Mishna San. 32a: &#x2018;All are eligible to judge civil suits&#x2019; which is explained in Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic> 36b: <italic>&#x2018;All</italic> includes a proselyte.<italic>&#x2019; Tosaf.</italic> (Yeb. 45b, s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05DF;</span>) however, maintain that the passage in Yeb. 102a refers to civil suits (i.e., if his mother was not an Israelitish woman he may judge only a fellow proselyte in civil suits but not an Israelite), and as to the text in San. <italic>ibid.</italic> it refers to a proselyte who judges a fellow proselyte only. <italic>Alfasi</italic> and <italic>Asheri</italic> write that in San. we deal with a proselyte whose mother was an Israelitish woman. <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s present ruling, viz., that even if one of the members of the <italic>Beth Din</italic> is a proselyte, the Court is unfit to judge an Israelite, is derived from Yeb. 101b: &#x2018;R. Samuel b. Judah was once standing before Rab Judah when the latter said to him, Come up to this bundle of reeds (a place designated for a <italic>&#x1E24;ali&#x1E93;ah</italic> ceremony) to be counted in the number of five (judges at the <italic>&#x1E24;ali&#x1E93;ah</italic> ceremony) so that the matter be publicized well (i.e., in order that it become known that she is a <italic>&#x1E24;alu&#x1E93;ah</italic> and forbidden to a <italic>Kohen</italic>). We have learned, the first said, <italic>In Israel</italic> (Deut. XXVI, 10) means at a Court of Israelites, but not at a Court of proselytes, and I am a proselyte.&#x2019; This shows that even if one of the members of the Court is a proselyte, it is unfit to judge. Even the children&#x2019;s children of a proselyte are ineligible to judge Israelites &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn186">2) The proselyte&#x2019;s.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn187">3) Yeb. 102a: &#x2018;If his mother was an Israelitish woman (i.e., even if his father is non-Jewish &#x2014; <italic>R.A.Eger</italic>) he may judge even an Israelite.&#x2019; For then the proselyte is considered <italic>one from among thy brethren</italic>. V., Yeb. 45a and <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05DF;</span>.

If his father alone was an Israelite (and his mother was a proselyte &#x2014; <italic>R.A.Eger</italic>) it goes without saying that the proselyte may judge a fellow Israelite &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn189">5) I.e., a real proselyte; but if he was conceived and born in a hallowed condition (his mother became a Jewess before conception), he is regarded as a genuine Israelite, in which case the Judge must be the issue of an Israelitish woman (v.

But as far as the proselyte Judge is concerned even if he was conceived and born in a hallowed condition, he may not judge a fellow-Israelite &#x2014; <italic>R.A. Eger, P.Tesh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn190">6) V. Y.D. &#x00A7; 269 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Cf. <italic>supra</italic> n. 1. <italic>D.M.</italic> writes on the authority <italic>of Mord</italic>. that a proselyte may judge another proselyte only with the latter&#x2019;s consent. <italic>M.E.</italic> states that he has not found this implication in <italic>Mord</italic>. nor in <italic>Asheri</italic>, but the law is (in accordance with Y.D. &#x00A7; 269 end) that a proselyte may judge a fellow proselyte even through compulsion and if the litigant agrees to be tried before a proselyte Judge, the latter may judge even an Israelite. Thus also <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic> and <italic>ShaK</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn191">7) Heb. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05DE;&#x05D6;&#x05E8;</span>. On the meaning of this term, v. Mishna Yeb. IV, 13 and E.H. &#x00A7; 4, 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn192">8) San. 36b: Mishna: &#x2018;All are fit to try civil suits.&#x2019; Gemara: &#x2018;What does <italic>all</italic> include? &#x2014; It is meant to include a bastard. Have we not already learnt this before (Nid. 49b), Whoever is fit to try capital cases is also fit to try civil suits. However, there are some who are fit to try civil suits but not capital cases &#x2026; One was intended to include a proselyte, the other a bastard.&#x2019; V., <italic>supra</italic> n. 1. Just as a proselyte may try a fellow-proselyte even if he has to compel the latter to appear before him for trial (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 6), so too, in the case of a bastard-Judge. This is derived from Mishna San. 32a: &#x2018;All are fit to try civil suits, but not all are fit to try capital cases,&#x2019; which means that as in the case of capital charges, compulsion may be used, so too, in the case of civil suits, the bastard-Judge may use compulsion &#x2014; <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu. Caro</italic>&#x2019;s ruling that even if the entire <italic>Beth Din</italic> is comprised of bastard-Judges they are considered fit to judge, is derived from the expression (San. <italic>ibid.</italic>) &#x2018;<italic>all</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05DB;&#x05DC;</span>) are eligible,&#x2019; which is meant to include not only if one of the Judges was a bastard, but even if an entire Court of three consists of bastard-Judges, they are eligible to act as Judges. Thus also Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> II, 9. V., also Kid. 76b, where it is stated that Judges may be appointed of genealogically ineligible persons save in Jerusalem where only Judges of pure descent were appointed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn193">9) I.e., even for legitimate Israelites. Not as in the case of a proselyte who may judge only a fellow-proselyte if the former&#x2019;s mother was not an Israelitish woman. The bastard-Judge may try even Israelites. This is deduced from Kid. <italic>ibid.</italic> according to the interpretation of San. 36b. <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05D3;&#x05D0;</span>. For contrary to the proselyte whose mother was not an Israelitish woman and consequently may only judge a fellow-proselyte, the bastard is of Jewish ancestry.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn194">10) Thus Yad <italic>ibid.; N; Ba&#x2018;al ha-Maor; R. Sherira Gaon a.o.</italic> This refers even to the &#x2018;commencement of a trial.&#x2019; <italic>Alfasi</italic> and <italic>Asheri</italic> state the reason as follows: Since all other people may conclude the trial by night and the eyesight of one blind in one eye is better by day, consequently, the latter may judge even at the commencement of the trial (<italic>M.E.</italic>), even &#x2018;in the first instance.&#x2019; For if this applies only to the conclusion of the trial, how can there be a conclusion without a commencement of the trial &#x2014; <italic>Lebush</italic> and <italic>Tummim</italic>. Here too, it refers to both one Judge or three Judges blind in one eye &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> V., <italic>supra</italic> nn. 6 and 8. The present ruling is derived from San. 34b; Nid. 49b-50a: &#x2018;Our Mishna (that a decision may be given at night) disagrees with R. Meir. For it has been taught, R. Meir would say, What is the meaning of the verse, <italic>According to their word shall every controversy and every leprosy be</italic> (Deut. XXI, 5) ? What connection is there between controversies and leprosies? Controversies are compared to leprosies: just as leprosies must be examined by day, since it is written, <italic>And in the day when raw flesh appeareth in him</italic> (Lev. XIII, 14) so must controversies be tried by day; and as leprosies are not to be examined by the blind (even in one eye, v. Neg. II, 3), for it is written, <italic>Wherever the priest looketh</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> v. 12), so controversies also may not be tried by a blind man (even in one eye only &#x2014; <italic>Yad Ramah</italic>) &#x2026; A blind man who lived in the neighbourhood of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan used to try civil suits and R. Jo&#x1E25;anan raised no objection against it. But how could he (R. Jo&#x1E25;anan) act so (to permit him to judge) ? Did not R. Jo&#x1E25;anan actually say, The <italic>Halakah</italic> agrees with an anonymous Mishna, and we have learnt (the following anonymous Mishna) : Whoever is fit to judge is eligible to testify. However, one may be fit to testify but not eligible to judge, and R. Jo&#x1E25;anan said that this includes one who is blind in one eye (consequently, R. Jo&#x1E25;anan should have objected to the blind man who acted as Judge) ? &#x2014; R. Jo&#x1E25;anan found another anonymous Mishna (according to which a blind man may judge): Civil suits must be tried by day and may be concluded by night (San. 32a. Hence, according to this Mishna &#x2018;controversies&#x2019; were not assimilated to &#x2018;leprosies.&#x2019; Consequently, they were not compared with respect to the unfitness of a blind man either, since there are many whose eyesight is as dim by night as a blind man during the day and yet, it states that they may conclude the trial by night). Why is this anonymous Mishna (San.) preferable to the other (Nid.) ? &#x2014; If you wish I might say, An anonymous Mishna which expresses the view of the majority is preferable (in Nid. the individual opinion of R. Meir is given; in San. that of the majority of the Rabbis), and if you wish I might reply that it (San.) was taught in the tractate dealing with legal procedure (whereas in Nid. it is cited only incidentally).&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn195">11) Thus Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> For only in the case of one blind in one eye is it permissible, whence it follows that one blind in both eyes is unfit to judge, since everyone agrees that it is forbidden to try cases at night (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 5, 2) and for one blind in both eyes the day too, is like night for him &#x2014; <italic>M.E. &#x2018;Ir Shushan</italic> deduces the prohibition against one blind in both eyes from the comparison made between &#x2018;controversies&#x2019; and &#x2018;leprosies&#x2019; (v. text <italic>supra</italic> n. 10). This is rejected by <italic>M.E.</italic>, for in San. and Nid. <italic>ibid.</italic> it was explained that this represents an individual opinion (R. Meir). Furthermore, on this principle, even one blind in one eye would be ineligible. <italic>W.G.</italic> writes <italic>contra M.E.</italic> that the eligibility of one blind in one eye is not on account of the comparison with &#x2018;night&#x2019; during which a trial may be concluded, for then one blind in both eyes should be fit to judge, but it is rather derived from the general rule in the first part of the Mishna (Nid. <italic>ibid.</italic>), viz., &#x2018;Whosoever is fit to judge is fit to testify,&#x2019; and since one blind in both eyes is ineligible to offer testimony, he is likewise unfit to judge. According to <italic>M.E.</italic> (who follows <italic>Alfasi</italic> and <italic>Asheri</italic>), a Judge whose eyesight was unimpaired at the commencement of the trial and before the trial was concluded became blind, would be eligible to judge at the conclusion of the trial (v. <italic>supra</italic>); whereas, according to &#x2018;<italic>Ir Shushan</italic> who compares &#x2018;controversies&#x2019; to &#x2018;leprosies,&#x2019; he would be ineligible &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>. An actual case is reported in <italic>Keneseth Ezekiel</italic> where the litigants were tried by three Judges and after the pleas were heard and the testimony was offered, one of the Judges accidentally became blind in both eyes, whereupon one of the litigants objected to the participation of the blind Judge in the conclusion of the trial. <italic>Keneseth Ezekiel</italic> after stating the views of the <italic>Codifiers</italic>, viz., a) <italic>Maim.</italic> &#x2014; one blind in both eyes is ineligible to judge even at the conclusion of the trial; b) <italic>Tosaf., SeMaG</italic> and <italic>Mord</italic>. &#x2014; eligible even for the commencement of the trial, c) <italic>Alfasi</italic> &#x2014; ineligible for the commencement of the trial, eligible for the conclusion, &#x2014; ruled in accordance with the last opinion (<italic>Alfasi</italic>). Hence, the Judge in the above case who became blind in both eyes before the conclusion of the trial, is eligible to judge together with the other two judges and give a decision. <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic> also states that <italic>ex post facto</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05E2;&#x05D1;&#x05D3;</span>) the decision of one blind in both eyes is valid. Moreover, the above case may be considered as <italic>ex post facto</italic>, since the pleas and testimony were already heard before the accident happened. In addition it may be said that since three Judges were present, then even if the decision of the now blind Judge is not valid, yet, on the basis of <italic>BeHaG</italic> and <italic>Tosaf.</italic> who accept Samuel&#x2019;s dictum, &#x2018;If two Judges tried a case, their decision holds good&#x2019; (San. 2b. Cf. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 3, 2), the recalcitrant litigant may be compelled to accept their decision. However, according to <italic>Tummim, Nethiboth</italic> a.o., even if the Judge became blind at the conclusion of the trial, he is ineligible &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>. One whose eyesight is very dim but is not blind may act as Judge. According to the majority of the <italic>Codifiers</italic> who rule that one blind in both eyes is unfit to judge, support for this may also be found in the following passage in Ket. 94b: &#x2018;(R. Jo&#x1E25;anan) said (to R. Shesheth who was totally blind), I am a Judge and the master is no Judge,&#x2019; i.e., R. Shesheth had no right to render a decision in a certain case mentioned <italic>ibid.</italic> Cf. <italic>Rashi ibid.</italic> &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn196">12) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of &#x2018;some say,&#x2019; derived from Shab. 56b: &#x2018;R. Samuel b. Na&#x1E25;mani said on the authority of R. Jonathan: Whoever says that Josiah sinned is mistaken, for it is written, <italic>And he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and walked in all the ways of David his father</italic> (II Kings XXII, 2). How then do I explain, <italic>and like unto him there was no king before him that returned</italic> (Shab) <italic>to the Lord with all his heart</italic> etc., (<italic>ibid.</italic> XXIII, 25, whence it follows that at first he sinned). This intimates that he reconsidered every decision that he rendered between the ages of eight (the time of his accession to the throne <italic>Ibid.</italic> v. 1) and eighteen&#x2019; (when the Book of the Law was discovered). He thus re-examined (this is the meaning of <italic>Shab</italic>) his decisions in the light of the Book of the Law discovered by &#x1E24;ilkiah (<italic>ibid</italic> vv. 1-8). &#x2018;Eighteen&#x2019; is taken by <italic>Rashi</italic> to refer to the eighteenth year of his reign. Hence, it has no connection with the age of the King. Some, however, take &#x2018;eighteen&#x2019; (and this is followed by <italic>Caro</italic> in the present ruling) as the age of the King, i.e., when Josiah was eighteen years of age, the Book of the Law was discovered by &#x1E24;ilkiah. At the age of eighteen a person is considered a distinguished and conspicuous individual and has the capability to save the poor from the hand of one who would rob him. This is one of the attributes of a Judge (v. <italic>Tur</italic> a.l.) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> V., also Aboth V, 21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn197">13) Deduced from Mishna Yeb. 96b: &#x2018;It is all one (i.e., with respect to illegal cohabitation) whether he is of the age of nine years and a day or whether he is of the age of twenty years and has not grown two pubic hairs.&#x2019; Thus we see that if one has not produced the signs of maturity, he still counts as a minor. Cf. Nid. V, 9. Hence, the present ruling.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn198">14) Derived from Y. San. IV, 9(22b): &#x2018;R. Abbahu states on the authority of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan: Even one who is less than twenty years old and has not grown two pubic hairs, is eligible to try civil suits but not capital charges.&#x2019; Although the age of thirteen is not mentioned in this text, it goes without saying that the Judge must not be less than thirteen years and a day, for only then is one designated an adult. As to the text in Shab. <italic>ibid.</italic>, this viewpoint accepts the interpretation of <italic>Rashi</italic> (v. n. 12 <italic>supra</italic>). Cf. also the reading in Shab. <italic>ibid., &#x2018;until eighteen&#x2019;</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05D3; &#x05D9;&#x05F4;&#x05D7;</span>). Were <italic>&#x2018;until eighteen years of age&#x2019;</italic> meant the reading should have been <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05D3; &#x05D1;&#x05DF; &#x05D9;&#x05F4;&#x05D7;</span>. V., <italic>Maharsha</italic> a.l. The underlying reason for the second viewpoint is that although with reference to valid testimony it is required that the witnesses possess signs of maturity, deduced from, <italic>then both the men between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the Lord</italic> (Deut. XIX, 17. This refers to the witnesses and it is obligatory that they be <italic>men</italic>, i.e., of mature age. V., Sheb. 30a; B.B. 155b), this is not the case with respect to a Judge. In the latter case he must possess a reasoning mind and be versed in the intricacies of the Law. But one who is less than thirteen years old, is ineligible to judge, for being a minor he does not come under the category of observing religious duties according to Biblical Law. However, a difficulty presents itself on the basis of the principle, &#x2018;Whoever is fit to judge is eligible to testify&#x2019; (Mishna Nid. 49b), which conversely, would mean that &#x2018;whoever is unfit to judge is ineligible to testify.&#x2019; Consequently, it follows that according to the first opinion recorded in the present ruling, one who is thirteen years of age and has grown two pubic hairs would be ineligible to testify, and again, according to the second viewpoint, one who is thirteen years of age but has not produced two pubic hairs would be ineligible to judge. This difficulty may be removed on the assumption that the above-mentioned principle was meant to assimilate testimony and adjudication with respect to the minority age of the individual only, for in both cases, a minor, i.e., one less than thirteen years and a day is unfit &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> In civil suits involving immovable property (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05E8;&#x05E7;&#x05E2;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span>), he may not judge until he produces two pubic hairs, for otherwise, his transaction is considered invalid in immovable property (V. B.B. 155b; <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 35, 3; &#x00A7; 235) &#x2014; <italic>Tummim. Mishkenoth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> supports the first view recorded in the present ruling, but concludes that a Judge should be appointed when he is at least twenty years old. <italic>Shebuth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> states that in the case of one who judges alone we should adopt a stringent view and one should not judge before he is forty years old unless there is none other greater than he available in that city (v. Y.D. &#x00A7; 242, 31, <italic>Gloss</italic>). But with respect to one who is a member of a Court of three, it is permissible for him to judge even before he reaches his fortieth year, for his decision should not be regarded as inferior to that of a Court of three laymen whose decision is binding &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>. V., also <italic>P.Tesh</italic>. to Y.D. <italic>ibid. A.H.</italic> writes that the above rulings are only added stringencies, and that according to Biblical Law, it seems that if the individual has grown two pubic hairs and is thirteen years of age plus one day, he may be a Judge. Before he produces the two pubic hairs, his decision is not binding (<italic>contra</italic> second opinion), for a minor&#x2019;s act is ineffective.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn199">15) B.K. 15a (v. parallel passages) : &#x2018;In the School of Eleazar it was taught: <italic>Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them</italic> (Ex. XXI, 1), &#x2014; the Scriptural text places a woman on the same level with a man as regards all the judgments of the law&#x2019; (i.e., with respect to civil suits). <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05E9;&#x05E8;</span> raises the question that <italic>before them</italic> refers only to those who are eligible to judge but not to those who are judged (v. <italic>Torah Temimah</italic> a.l.). Cf. Git. 88b: &#x2018;<italic>before them</italic>, but not before laymen,&#x2019; and a woman is ineligible to judge, for the Mishna Nid. 49b states that &#x2018;Whoever is fit to judge is fit to testify&#x2019; and since a woman is unfit to testify (v. B.K. 88a; Sheb. 30a), it follows that she is unable to judge. Consequently, the above passage that equates man and woman as regards all the judgments of the law refers to woman only from the point of view of being judged in cases where she has monetary claims against another person, but she herself may not act as Judge. As to Deborah, the prophetess concerning whom it is stated that <italic>She judged Israel at that time</italic> (Judges IV, 4) whence we see that a woman may judge, it may be said that it was permissible only on account of a Divine order, or that she merely taught the Law. But the text serves as no precedent that a woman may judge. V., also Y. Yoma VI, 1(43b); Y. Sheb. IV, 1(35b) where it is stated that a woman may not judge because she is ineligible to testify. Cf. also Yad, <italic>Melakim</italic> I, 5 and <italic>RIDBaZ</italic> a.l.; Sifre to <italic>Shofetim</italic> XVII, 15. Although a woman may not judge, nevertheless, a learned woman may instruct law and offer legal directives (cf. <italic>supra</italic> on Deborah and <italic>Sefer ha-&#x1E24;innuk</italic> &#x00A7; 83 and &#x00A7; 152; <italic>Sha&#x2018;are Teshubah</italic> to O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 461, n. 17 &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn200">16) Mishna San. 40a: &#x2018;They (the Judges) drink no wine the entire day.&#x2019; Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic> 42a: &#x2018;Why is wine not permitted? &#x2014; R. A&#x1E25;a b. &#x1E24;anina said: The Scriptural text states, <italic>It is not for princes to say, Where is strong drink</italic> (<italic>Prov</italic>. XXXI, 4), (i.e.,) those engaged in (solving) the secrets of the world (administration of justice, connecting <span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05D6;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span> with <span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05D6;</span>, secret) must abstain from strong drink.&#x2019; <italic>Tosaf. ibid.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05E2;&#x05D5;&#x05E1;&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span> write that this refers only to the adjudication of capital charges, but not to civil suits. As to the text in &#x2018;Er. 64a: &#x2018;He who drank a quarter of a <italic>Log</italic> of wine must not render legal decisions,&#x2019; it refers to giving a legal decision in ritual law (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05D5;&#x05E8; &#x05D5;&#x05D4;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05E8;</span>. Cf. the expression <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05DC; &#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05D4;</span>). V., also Yad, <italic>Bi&#x2019;ath ha-Mikdash</italic> I, 3; Y.D. &#x00A7; 242, 13, <italic>Gloss</italic>. The present ruling, viz., that in civil suits one who is under the influence of wine may act as a Judge has reference only to a case where there are two other Judges present who will remind him of the law should he err, but a single Judge or three Judges under the influence of wine should not judge &#x2014; <italic>Tummim, Nethiboth</italic>. However, according to Num. R. X, 4, one under the influence of wine may not act as a Judge even in civil suits (cf. the expression <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05DC; &#x05D9;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05DF;</span> <italic>ibid</italic>) which contradicts the present ruling. <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic> and <italic>Shebuth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> rule that even in civil suits one under the influence of wine is forbidden to act as Judge. Thus also <italic>R. Jonah</italic> in <italic>Sefer ha-Yir&#x2019;ah</italic> makes no distinction between ritual and civil law. In both cases one under the influence of wine must not act as a Judge &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh. M.E.</italic> writes that since our wines nowadays are diluted, we may adopt a leniency with respect to a Judge who partakes of a quarter of a <italic>Log</italic> of wine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn201">17) Ket. 21a: &#x2018;R. Abba sat and stated this law, that a witness may act as a Judge. R. Safra raised an objection against R. Abba: If three saw it (the new Moon) and they are of the Court (that sanctifies the new moon), two (of them) stand up and set (two) of their fellows (of the <italic>Sanhedrin</italic>) beside the one (Judge) and they (the two) bear witness before them (the three who constitute the Court) and (then) they may say, It is hallowed&#x0021; It is hallowed&#x0021;, &#x2014; for a single person is not believed by himself. Now, if you entertain the opinion that a witness may act as a Judge, what is all this for? Let them sit in their places (after testifying) and declare (in conjunction with the third person), the new Moon is hallowed&#x0021; &#x2014; He (R. Abba) replied: That also presented a difficulty to me, and I asked R. Isaac b. Martha, and R. Isaac (asked) R. Huna, and R. Huna (asked) &#x1E24;iyya b. Rab, and &#x1E24;iyya b. Rab (asked) Rab, and he said to them, Leave alone the testimony regarding the new Moon (because it is) Biblical and the attestation of documents is Rabbinical (In a Biblical matter a witness may not act as a Judge; in the case of a Rabbinic enactment, e.g., the confirmation of documents this does not apply. Cf. Git. 5b).&#x2019; B.B. 113b-114a: &#x2018;Rabbah b. &#x1E24;anina taught a Baraitha before R. Na&#x1E25;man: (It is written,) <italic>Then it shall be in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit</italic> (Deut. XXI, 16) &#x2014; (this teaches) that you may make the division of inheritances during the day, but not at night. Abaye said unto him: But according to this (Abaye assumes that the division of an inheritance is made only when the person died in the daytime) would children inherit him who died during the day and not him who died at night? Perhaps you refer to the adjudication of inheritances (which must take place during the day. V., <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 5), for it was taught: (With the Biblical text), <italic>but it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment</italic> (Num. XXVII, 11), the whole section (Num. <italic>ibid.</italic> vv. 1-11 on the laws of inheritance) has been proclaimed as of a judicial nature (The judicial procedure of inheritances is equated to that of civil suits in general. Those who are present form a Court of three even if the testator&#x2019;s natural heirs are opposed to it. Thus <italic>Tosaf.</italic> who explain that this refers both to a sickbed bequest as well as to one made by a person in good health. V., <italic>Rashi</italic> to San. 34b). And this is in accord with Rab Judah who said: If three (persons) came to visit a sick person, they may, if they so desire (either) write down (his bequest and thus act as witnesses to the document), or issue a judicial verdict (for since they are three they form a laycourt and thus attest to the instructions of the testator and execute the Will). If two (persons came), they may write down (the instructions and act as witnesses to the document), but may not issue a judicial verdict (for since they are less than three they cannot constitute a Court and merely may act as witnesses). R. &#x1E24;isda stated: This applies only to daytime; at night, however, even three (persons) may (only) record (the instructions of the testator and act as witnesses), but may not form a Court (because at night judicial sessions are not held for the commencement of a trial. V., <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7;. 5). What is the reason? Because (at night) they (merely) become (eligible to act as) witnesses and a witness may not act as a Judge (this means that even on the following day they may not act as Judges in this matter since the instructions were recorded at night and they became qualified to act as witnesses only).&#x2019; Cf. San. 34b. Mishna R.H. 25b: &#x2018;If three saw it &#x2026; It is hallowed&#x2019; (v. first part of this note for text). Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic> 25b-26a: &#x2018;This means that a witness may act as Judge. May we say that our Mishna is not in agreement with R. Akiba, for it has been taught: If the <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> beheld a man murder a person, some of them act as witnesses and some of them as Judges. This is the opinion of R. Tarfon. R. Akiba says: They all act as witnesses and a witness may not act as a Judge? &#x2014; You may even say that our Mishna is in agreement with R. Akiba, but R. Akiba stated this only with respect to capital charges, for the All-Merciful commanded, <italic>the congregation shall judge &#x2026; and the congregation shall deliver</italic> (Num. XXXV, 25-26), and since they saw him murder a person, they cannot find any defence in his favour. However, in this case, even R. Akiba agrees (that a witness may act as a Judge).&#x2019; Cf. B.K. 90b. V., also Y. R.H. III, 1(58d); Y. San. I, 2(18c); <italic>ibid.</italic> V, 5(23a). There are two fundamental reasons why a witness may not act as a Judge: a) Evidence that is given must be liable to refutation by proving an alibi (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05EA; &#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05DB;&#x05D5;&#x05DC; &#x05DC;&#x05D4;&#x05D6;&#x05D9;&#x05DE;&#x05D4;</span>. V., <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 1, n. 40). Hence, if we should say that a witness may act as a Judge, this principle would not be applicable, for the Judge will never accept any refutation against himself; b) It is written, <italic>then both the men between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the Lord, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days</italic> (Deut. XIX, 17), &#x2014; <italic>Both the men</italic> refers to the witnesses; <italic>between &#x2026; is</italic> applies to the litigants; <italic>before the Lord &#x2026; judges</italic> means that they must stand before the Judges. Hence, if a witness may act as a Judge, this exposition would be impossible. Cf. <italic>supra</italic> n. 14. V., Ket. 21b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05E0;&#x05D7;</span> and par. ref. Consequently, if three persons beheld the incident during the day when it is permissible to hold a judicial session, they constitute a Court of three and are not designated as witnesses. Hence, they may act as Judges as stated anon &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn202">18) Together with another person &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn203">19) I.e., before a Court of three, for hearing evidence is part of the adjudication which requires three Judges to be present. It means that after one of the Judges rises to testify in conjunction with another lay person, the remaining two Judges co-opt a third person to form a <italic>Beth Din</italic> of three. Consequently, after giving evidence, the witness may not return to sit with the Judges &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn204">20) R.H. 25b-26a and parallel passages. V., texts <italic>supra</italic> n. 17; Ket. 21b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05E0;&#x05D7;</span> and parallel references.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn205">21) <italic>Ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn206">22) At which time they were eligible to act as Judges. V., <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 5, 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn207">23) Cf. <italic>supra</italic> n. 20. A judicial session may be held in this case since we can argue that hearing the evidence should not carry greater weight than seeing the incident, and they may hold the judicial session even at a later date just as in the case of hearing evidence in general a judicial session may be held at a later date. Not so, however, when they saw the matter at night, in which case they only become witnesses and cannot act as Judges, for hearing the evidence is also not valid in the first instance if heard at night &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn208">24) At which time judicial sessions are not held. V., <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 5, 2. Likewise, if they beheld the incident on the Sabbath or Festival, they may not act as Judges, although the prohibition against trying cases on these days is only a Rabbinic measure (<italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic>). This question, however, requires further elucidation &#x2014; <italic>ShaK. Ta</italic>Z opposes <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic>, for on the principle that in a Rabbinic matter a witness may act as a Judge (v. <italic>Isserles</italic> anon and <italic>supra</italic> n. 17), it should be permissible. <italic>Keneseth Ezekiel</italic> agrees with <italic>Ba&#x1E24;. Tummim</italic> is in agreement with <italic>Ta</italic>Z. <italic>K.H.</italic> concludes that we should adopt a leniency in this matter. Hence, they may hold a judicial session on a following day even if they beheld the incident on the Sabbath or Festival &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn209">25) V. <italic>supra</italic> n. 20. For in this case since judicial sessions are not held at night, they merely become designated as witnesses and we cannot apply the principle, &#x2018;let the hearing of evidence not carry greater weight than seeing the incident,&#x2019; since the time of seeing the incident was not the time of hearing the evidence, because we receive no evidence at night &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn210">26) The next day or even many days later.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn211">27) For in this case it carries even lesser weight than beholding the incident at night. Thus <italic>RaShBaM</italic> to B.B. <italic>ibid.</italic>, where it is stated that &#x2018;<italic>If three persons came to visit a sick man</italic> etc.&#x2019; (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 17), whence it follows that they did not come at the express bidding of the testator to act as witnesses (note the words <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05DB;&#x05E0;&#x05E1;&#x05D5; &#x05DC;&#x05D1;&#x05E7;&#x05E8;</span>), for if they were invited or ordered by the testator to come, they would be designated as witnesses, and consequently, even if they came during the day, they would not be able to act as Judges even if other witnesses give evidence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn212">28) This is similar to beholding the incident at night. Thus <italic>Tosaf.</italic> to B.B. <italic>ibid. RaN</italic> rules as follows: If they came with the express intent to act as witnesses, we adopt the view of <italic>Tosaf.;</italic> but if they were ordered to come and act as witnesse, we follow the opinion of <italic>RaShBaM</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn213">29) E.g., the sanctification of the new Moon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn214">30) E.g., the confirmation of documents.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn215">31) Ket. 21b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05E0;&#x05D7;</span>; <italic>N.Yos. ibid.;</italic> San. 34b &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> V., <italic>supra</italic> n. 17. To sum up this ruling, the following principles should be borne in mind: a) Mere intention to act as witnesses of an incident does not invalidate the individuals from acting as Judges; b) Once they have testified they no longer may act as Judges; c) If they beheld the incident during the day, they may act as Judges; if at night, they may act as Judges if others testify; d) If they were summoned to act as witnesses, there is a difference of opinion between <italic>RaShBaM</italic> and <italic>Tosaf.;</italic> e) In a Rabbinic matter even a witness who testified may act as a Judge.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn216">32) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>R. Hai Gaon</italic>. Derived from Kid. 70a: &#x2018;A certain individual from Nehardea entered a butcher&#x2019;s shop in Pumbeditha and stated: Give me meat&#x0021; They replied: Wait until the attendant of Rab Judah b. Ezekiel takes his and then we shall serve you. He exclaimed, Who is Rab Judah b. Shewiskel (a nickname for Ezekiel, derived from <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D6;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05E7;&#x05D9;</span> meaning roast, i.e., the eater of roast meat) to take precedence over me and to be served before me? They went and informed Rab Judah (about this), whereupon he pronounced the ban against him. They said to him (further), He (that man) is in the habit of calling people slaves, whereupon he (Rab Judah) announced that he (that man) was a slave (himself). Thereupon that man went and summoned him (Rab Judah) to a lawsuit before R. Na&#x1E25;man. When they brought the writ of summons, Rab Judah went before R. Huna and asked him, Shall I go or not? (his high office gave him the right not to recognize R. Na&#x1E25;man&#x2019;s authority over himself). He (R. Huna) answered: Indeed you must not go because you are a distinguished personage, but on account of the honour of the <italic>Nasi</italic>&#x2019;s house (R. Na&#x1E25;man was the son-in-law of the <italic>Resh Galutha</italic>) arise and go.&#x2019; From this passage it follows that one is not obliged to appear before a Judge who is inferior to him. Furthermore, it does not depend upon the age of the Judge who sent the writ of summons, for even if the latter is much older than the scholar who is summoned, nevertheless, if in learning and knowledge he is inferior to him, he cannot compel him to appear before him (cf. B.B. 142b). The same principle applies to a single Judge or a Court of three who sent the writ of summons &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>. The mode of expression used here indicates that <italic>R. Hai Gaon</italic> holds that if the defendant agrees to be tried before a Judge who is inferior to him, he may appear before the latter for trial on the principle that &#x2018;A Rabbi who renounces his honour, it is considered renounced&#x2019; (Kid. 32a-b). For if this were not so, how can the inferior scholar summon him to law in the first place. Hence, he may summon him only because there is a possibility that the latter may agree to come &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>. &#x2018;They call a meeting of the scholars &#x2026; themselves,&#x2019; means that the scholars of that locality examine the case together. Consequently, it is no longer disreputable for him to be tried in their presence &#x2014; <italic>Tummim. Ba&#x1E24;</italic> explains that the words, &#x2018;and look into the matter&#x2019; means that they investigate the case in order to determine whether it is proper for him to appear for trial or not. In a case where it is not respectable for the scholar to appear in Court with a litigant who is an uncultured person, the Court may send scribes to the scholar&#x2019;s home in order to record his arguments in writing and then they adjudicate the case on the basis of the recorded information &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> V., <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 124. Cf. also <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 28, 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn217">33) Yad <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXIII, 6. Derived from Ket. 105b: &#x2018;R. Papa said, One should not adjudicate a lawsuit either for one whom he loves or for one whom he hates; for he will not see the guilt of one whom he loves, or notice the merit of one whom he hates.&#x2019; This text does not state the degree of friendship or enmity. <italic>Tosaf.</italic> a.l., s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05D0;</span> writes that this is not similar to the degree of friendship or enmity that disqualifies witnesses from giving evidence according to R. Judah who defines a friend as one&#x2019;s groomsman and an enemy as one who out of enmity has not spoken to an individual for three days (San. 27a. The majority of the Rabbis [San. <italic>ibid.</italic>] hold <italic>contra</italic> R. Judah that Israelites are not to be suspected of giving false evidence on account of friendship or enmity and consequently may testify), for in the case of Judges, even the Rabbis will admit that one is ineligible to act as a Judge for a friend or enemy as defined by R. Judah, for it is difficult for the Judges to be unprejudiced and impartial under such circumstances (derived from a Scriptural text <italic>ibid.</italic> 29a). In Ket. we deal with a &#x2018;friend&#x2019; as reported in the case of Amemar who was adjudicating an action when a bird flew down upon his head and a man removed it therefrom. When Amemar asked him what he was doing there, he told him that he came with a lawsuit. Whereupon Amemar stated that he was disqualified to act as his Judge. This was an added stringency because legally Amemar was not ineligible. <italic>Caro</italic>, however, in the present ruling (following <italic>Maim.</italic>) by stating, &#x2018;It is <italic>forbidden</italic> etc.,&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05E1;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;</span>) apparently disagrees with <italic>Tosaf.</italic> and holds that the prohibition is not on account of a mere stringency. The only similarity between <italic>Caro</italic> and <italic>Tosaf.</italic> is that the meaning of the terms &#x2018;friend&#x2019; and &#x2018;enemy&#x2019; used in the case of Judges is different from the meaning of these terms employed in the context of evidence (v. <italic>RIDBaZ</italic> to Yad <italic>ibid.</italic>). If both litigants are equally his friends or his enemies, one should not act as their Judge &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh. A.H.</italic>, however, permits him to act as Judge even in the first instance. If a witness is signed on a document, he may not act as a Judge in the confirmation of that document (<italic>R. Yeru&#x1E25;am</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK</italic>. Cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 46, 24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn218">34) San. 27b, 29a. He is regarded as such the entire seven days of the marriage feast &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Thus also <italic>Rashi ibid.</italic> According to the Rabbis on the authority of Raba (San. 29a) after the first day he is no longer regarded as his groomsman. <italic>Tummim</italic> states that nowadays since most of the people do not make the feast for seven days, all admit that after the first day he is no longer considered his groomsman.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn220">36) V. Nnm. XXXV, 23. Cf. Ket. <italic>ibid.</italic> and <italic>supra</italic> n. 33. In the case of one who borrowed money from a scholar and subsequently denied having received the loan and took a false oath, and later appeared before this scholar with a lawsuit, the law is that the scholar should not act as his Judge, for he will not see any merit for him &#x2014; <italic>&#x1E24;awwoth Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn221">37) San. 7b-8a: <italic>&#x2018;You shall not respect persons</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05D0; &#x05EA;&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;</span>) <italic>in judgment</italic> (Deut. I, 17). R. Judah says, this means, You shall not favour him (if he is your friend) ; and R. Eleazar says, (If he is your enemy) do not discriminate against him). Rab&#x2019;s host came before him with a lawsuit and said, Were you not once my guest? Yes, he replied (and what is your request?) I have a lawsuit. Whereupon Rab said, I am ineligible to act as your Judge.&#x2019;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn227">43) V. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 13 beg. &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> But one who Biblically is considered a relative or otherwise ineligible is unfit to be a Judge, even if each litigant chooses one Judge etc. (Mishna San. 23a-b). Hence, <italic>Isserles</italic> writes, &#x2018;Therefore etc.,&#x2019; i.e., since the prohibition is merely a measure of piety, it follows that in the case of one who is unfit Biblically, he may not act as Judge.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn228">44) Each one chooses a Judge who understands his case well, and if each Judge finds some merit in favour of his friend who chose him, he will present it to his fellow-Judge, and the third Judge will then harmonize the conflicting opinions.

<ftnote id="fn229">45) <italic>MaHaRIK</italic> Rt. 16 &#x2014; This refers to the preceding ruling, viz., that in the case of a litigant who is not his real friend or enemy, the prohibition is only on account of a measure of piety. Derived from Shab. 30b: &#x2018;And Rabbah son of R. Huna stated: If a Rabbinical scholar and an illiterate person have a legal dispute with each other, the scholar should not come first and sit down (before the Judge prior to the arrival of his opponent even if he keeps his silence) for it appears as if he is presenting his case (which is forbidden before the opponent arrives). And we say this only when he has no fixed time (for study) with him; but if he has a fixed time (for study) with him, we have nothing against this (i.e., if the Judge is his teacher and this is the appointed time for his lesson, the scholar is permitted to arrive before his opponent), because he (his opponent) will say, he is busy with his lesson.&#x2019; We, therefore, see that no prohibition exists against a teacher acting as Judge for his disciple. The Judge may also adjudicate a case of the father of his disciple, although he receives tuition fees from him &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Likewise, may one act as Judge in lawsuits involving his host, employees or daily workers &#x2014; <italic>ShaK</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn230">46) <italic>Decisions of Isserlein</italic> s. 258 and <italic>MaHaRIK</italic> Rt. 21 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> V., San. 8a. <italic>MaHaRIK ibid.</italic> writes that even one who adopts a stringent view out of piety is fit to choose Judges. <italic>Isserlein ibid.</italic> states that every Court that is ineligible to adjudicate a case, has a right to appoint another Court &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> However, one who is unfit to judge on account of kinship may not appoint another <italic>Beth Din</italic> unless such is the prevailing custom in that particular community &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn232">48) V. <italic>supra</italic> n. 32 regarding the case of the man who insulted Rab Judah b. Ezekiel and the latter placed him under a ban and subsequently declared him to be a slave, whence it follows that although he first placed him under a ban, yet, he did not hesitate later to designate him a slave, which shows that Rab Judah did not have the status of an enemy. In <italic>D.M., Isserles</italic> writes that this requires further elucidation. V., <italic>M.E.</italic> who writes that <italic>Isserles</italic> is doubtful because while the ban is in force there still is enmity among them. Consequently, during the ban, the Judge who imposed it, should not try the same person for another offence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn233">49) Thus Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXIII, 7. Derived from San. 29a: &#x2018;R. Jose, son of R. Judah said, <italic>And he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm</italic> (Num. XXXV, 23); from this we derive that two scholars who hate each other, may not sit together in judgment.&#x2019; <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic> writes that if they are real enemies (v. <italic>supra</italic> par. 7) their decision is Biblically not binding, since a Scriptural text is adduced to support this ruling. Two individuals who differ in their deportement and characteristic features, should not be appointed to any office (<italic>Sefer ha-&#x1E24;innuk</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>. In the first instance a Judge should not try the case of the father-in-law of his son or daughter, even if he is a permanent Judge. However, <italic>ex post facto</italic>, his decision stands. But when trying other suits, the Judge may sit with him in judgment, even in the first instance &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth</italic> (<italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 33).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn234">50) One who came with a lawsuit to an expert Judge (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05D4;</span>) and was aware that his fellow-litigant is related to the Judge, the law is that the latter is permitted to adjudicate the case, since the very fact that the litigant is satisfied that this Judge should try the case despite the latter&#x2019;s relationship to the fellow-litigant, is tantamount to an acceptance of the Judge. Should, however, the related litigant desire to declare the Judge ineligible, he has the right to do so &#x2014; <italic>ShaK, A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote>51) A public announcement (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05DB;&#x05E8;&#x05D6;&#x05D4;</span>) is required to be made with respect to a person who Rabbinically is disqualified to act as a witness. Not so, however, in the case of a Judge &#x2014; <italic>Keneseth ha-Gedolah. Ezrath Nashim</italic> requires a public announcement even in the case of a Judge.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn235">52) Derived from Mishna Nid. 49b: &#x2018;Whoever is eligible to judge is eligible to give evidence, and some are eligible to give evidence and are not eligible to judge.&#x2019; If one of the Judges was found to be a kinsman or otherwise ineligible, the entire judgment is invalidated as in the case of witnesses (<italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 36, 1) &#x2014; <italic>R.A.Eger</italic>. The litigants must then present their pleas again before eligible Judges and a new adjudication is required. The previous Judges, excluding the Judge who was related to the witnesses or to an otherwise ineligible person, may participate in the new adjudication &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn236">53) <italic>RaN</italic> to Ket. II end; <italic>RaShBA Resp.</italic> s. 790; v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 33, 17 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Derived from Y. San. III, 10(23c); Y. Sheb. IV, 1(35b) according to the version of <italic>Alfasi</italic> and <italic>Asheri</italic> to San. III: &#x2018;Whence is it derived that the witnesses should not be related to each other? &#x2014; This follows from your own logical deduction, (viz.,) that if one of them was proven to be a <italic>Zomem</italic> (v. Deut. XIX, 19), is he put to death (by the law of retaliation) before his fellow (-witness) is (also) proven to be a <italic>Zomem?</italic> &#x2014; (Certainly not.) Consequently, since the law of retaliation operates only if both witnesses are proven to be <italic>Zomemim</italic>, it follows that if both witnesses are related to each other, each kinsman-witness would be put to death through the testimony of his fellow kinsman-witness (which is impossible on the basis of the text, <italic>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers</italic> &#x2014; Deut. XXIV, 16, &#x2014; which is explained anon to intimate that all relations, not only fathers and sons, are not to be put to death through the testimony of other relations. V., Y. anon and cf. San. 27b-28a). (For) if you say thus (i.e., that witnesses may be related to each other, would not the result be that one kinsman-witness) is put to death on his (i.e., the other kinsman-witness) testimony? Whence is it derived that the witnesses should not be related to the Judges? &#x2014; This follows from your own logical deduction, (viz.,) that if they (the witnesses who are related to the Judges) are proven to be <italic>Zomemim</italic>, would not (the result be that) they (the witnesses) are put to death through their (the Judges&#x2019;) verdict (i.e., after the Judges receive the refutation of the testimony that was given by the witnesses who were related to the Judges) ? Whence is it derived that the Judges should not be related to each other? &#x2014; Scripture states : Put to death on the testimony of witnesses (v. Deut. XIX, 15) ; Put to death according to the decision of Judges (v. Deut. XVII, 11) &#x2014; just as witnesses must not be related to each other, so too, must the Judges not be related to each other.&#x2019; Cf. also <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 46, 21. The Judges must not be related even to the mandatories of the litigants, provided the mandatories are interested parties in that they will have a share in anything that is ruled in favour of the litigants whom they represent &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn237">54) Even if he renders a correct verdict &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic>, or even if they arbitrate the case &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXII, 10; II, 14. Derived from Sheb. 30b: &#x2018;Whence do we derive that a Judge who knows his colleague to be a robber or a witness who knows his colleague to be a robber should not join with him (to judge or testify) ? &#x2014; Because it is said, <italic>From a false matter keep far</italic> (Ex. XXIII, 7).&#x2019; Hence, if the status of his colleague is unknown to him, he may sit with him in judgment. V., however, <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 3, 4: &#x2018;It is forbidden for a wise man to sit in judgment until he knows with whom he sits lest he sit with people who are not suitable and is (then) found to be included in a council of conspirators and not in a <italic>Beth Din</italic>,&#x2019; &#x2014; whence it follows that as long as one is not certain about the eligibility of his fellow-Judge, he must not join with him, which contradicts the present ruling. <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic> therefore, explains that <italic>supra</italic> we deal with a Judge who is distinguished in wisdom and learning, in which case he should first make certain about the eligiblity of his colleague; whereas in the present ruling we treat of an ordinary Judge who is permitted to join with a colleague to sit in judgment unless it is known to him that the latter is a robber or a wicked person. <italic>Tummim</italic> removes the contradiction by explaining that <italic>supra</italic> we deal with the commencement of a trial, in which case one must make certain that his colleague is fit to judge; whereas here we deal with a case where the trial had already commenced and he thought that his colleague was an eligible person, but during the proceedings it became clear to him that his colleague was ineligible to judge, in which case the law is that if he knows him to be a robber etc., he must discontinue the proceedings (note the expression <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05E9;&#x05D1;</span> employed <italic>supra</italic> and <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05D4;&#x05E6;&#x05D8;&#x05E8;&#x05E3;</span> used here). <italic>Shebuth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> explains that <italic>supra</italic> we deal with a Judge who does not know his other two colleagues. Hence, he must not sit with them before he determines their eligibility. Otherwise, he is regarded as associating himself with a council of conspirators, since the majority of the members of the Court are unfit to judge. However, if two of the Judges know each other, but they do not know the third Judge, there would actually be no prohibition if they associated themselves with the latter, yet, the pure-minded of Jerusalem would refrain from sitting in judgment with such a Judge until they would be certain about his eligibility (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 3, n. 33). The present ruling, however, has reference to a case where one of the three Judges knows one of his colleagues to be a robber etc., in which case he must not join with him, even if the third Judge is fit, for although this Court is not regarded as a council of conspirators since the majority of its members are fit, yet, it is forbidden on account of the Biblical injunction, <italic>From a false matter keep far</italic>. If the litigants accepted the ineligible Judge, there is no prohibition against joining with the latter since there are two eligible Judges, and consequently, it is not considered a council of conspirators and the verse, <italic>From a false etc.</italic>, is not applicable &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn238">55) Thus <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn239">56) This is the meaning of <span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>, (v. next note), according to Maim. &#x2014; <italic>W.G.</italic> Cf. Gen. XVIII, 19 and <italic>Rashi</italic> a.l.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn240">57) V. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 8, 1. &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> This is the meaning of &#x2018;able men&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05E0;&#x05E9;&#x05D9; &#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;</span>), i.e., individuals who are endowed with the will-power to act justly and righteously and thereby acquire a fine reputation. <italic>Tur</italic> citing Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> II, 7. The following sources enumerate the qualities that a Judge must possess: Tosef (&#x1E92;). San. VII, 1; <italic>ibid.</italic> Hag. II, 9; Y. San. I, 4(19c); San. 88b. In the three latter sources the quality of &#x2018;humility&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;</span>) is mentioned after &#x2018;wisdom&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05DB;&#x05DD;</span>). The quality of &#x2018;humility,&#x2019; however, is not found in the following additional sources: Deut. R. I, 10 to v. 13 <italic>ibid.</italic>: &#x2018;R. Berekiah on the authority of R. &#x1E24;aninah stated: Judges must possess the following seven qualities: (They must be) wise men (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05DB;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>), understanding (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>), full of knowledge (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>). Hence we have three. And four more as it is written elsewhere (Ex. XVIII, 21), <italic>Thou shalt provide out of all the people able men</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05E0;&#x05E9;&#x05D9; &#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;</span>), <italic>such as fear G-d</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05D9; &#x05D0;&#x05DC;&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span> ), <italic>men of truth</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05E0;&#x05E9;&#x05D9; &#x05D0;&#x05DE;&#x05EA;</span>), <italic>hating unjust gain</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05D0;&#x05D9; &#x05D1;&#x05E6;&#x05E2;</span>). Hence, we have seven. Why were not the seven stated together? (To intimate) that if (Judges) were not found (endowed) with seven (qualities), one may bring (Judges) possessing (only) four (qualities) ; and if (Judges) were not found (endowed) with four (qualities), one may bring those possessing three (qualities); and if these were not found, one may bring (Judges) possessing one (quality), for it is written, <italic>A woman of valour who can find</italic> (Prov. XXXI, 10).&#x2019; In the last verse quoted it seems that the Midrash takes <italic>a woman of valour</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05E9;&#x05EA; &#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;</span>) as equivalent to <italic>able men</italic> mentioned in Ex. <italic>ibid.</italic>, i.e., even if the Judges possessed only one quality, it suffices. Cf. Prov. <italic>ibid.</italic> v. 23: <italic>Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land</italic>. This refers to the gates of justice where local matter were adjudicated. Hence, the connection between the text in Prov. and that of Ex. V., <italic>MaHaRZaW</italic> to Deut. R. <italic>ibid.</italic> Cf. also Sifre to Deut. <italic>ibid.</italic> on the seven qualities that a Judge should possess. <italic>Maim.</italic> (followed by <italic>Tur</italic> and <italic>Caro</italic>) considers &#x2018;wise men&#x2019; and &#x2018;understanding&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05DB;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05DD; &#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>) as one quality. Hence, he adds the quality of &#x2018;humility&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05D4;</span>), although it is not mentioned in Deut. R. However, it seems that he followed San. B. and Y. and Tosef Hag. <italic>ibid.</italic>, where <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05E0;&#x05DF;</span> is mentioned. V., <italic>Le&#x1E25;em Mishneh</italic> to Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> &#x2018;Humility&#x2019; was a quality that Moses possessed, <italic>Now the man Moses was very humble</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;</span>) &#x2014; Num. XIII, 3 &#x2014; and since in Ex. <italic>ibid.</italic> v. 22 it is stated, <italic>so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee</italic>: <italic>&#x2018;with thee&#x2019;</italic> implies like unto thee (Kid. 76b; San. 36b; Hor. 4b), it follows that Judges who are appointed must also be endowed with the quality of humility or meekness as in the case of Moses. Cf. <italic>Maim.</italic> Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> who elaborates on the qualities to be possessed by Judges and gives a different order from that mentioned in the above texts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn241">58) B.B. 43a: &#x2018;Has it not been taught: If a Torah scroll belonging to the townspeople was stolen, (the alleged culprit who claims that he bought it &#x2014; Thus <italic>RaShBaM</italic>), must not be tried by the Judges of that town, nor can evidence be given (against him) by the inhabitants of that town (because they are all interested parties). Now if we adopt the opinion that a partner can renounce his interest (v. Gemara <italic>supra</italic>), why cannot two of the inhabitants of the town renounce their interest in the scroll and try (the alleged culprit) ? &#x2014; A Torah scroll is different because it is utilized for public reading (hence, none of the inhabitants of that town can entirely renounce his interest in it, unless he leaves the town. Consequently, all are considered interested parties). Come and hear: If one says, Give a <italic>Maneh</italic> to the poor of my town (and it was stolen, the alleged culprit) &#x2026; must not be tried by the poor Judges of that town, nor may the poor of that town give evidence &#x2026; Cannot two of them renounce their interest and adjudicate the case? &#x2014; Here too, we (treat of) a Torah scroll and the reason why the donor referred to the recipients as poor is because all are poor with respect to a Torah scroll.&#x2019; V., Yad, <italic>&#x2018;Eduth</italic> XV, 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn242">59) In the Synagogue where the Judge or Judges worship. For then the Judges are no longer interested parties. But if in this Synagogue there is no other Torah scroll available, though there is another Synagogue in town where they have a Torah scroll, yet, in order for the Judges to be permitted to try the case, they must renounce their interest in this Synagogue. This is derived from <italic>RaShBaM</italic> to B.B. <italic>ibid.</italic>, s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D4;&#x05DB;&#x05DC; &#x05D0;&#x05E6;&#x05DC;</span>: &#x2018;All are in need of the Torah scroll, and it is customary to refer to the townspeople who have no Torah scroll as <italic>poor</italic> (v. text <italic>supra</italic> n. 58 and), for there is no greater poverty than this.&#x2019; It follows, therefore, that only when this is the only Torah scroll they possess that they are designated <italic>poor</italic>, but if they have in addition another scroll, then after renouncing their interest, they may adjudicate the case and are permitted to read even in the disputed Torah scroll. Thus also <italic>Tur; Asheri</italic> in <italic>Resp.</italic> and <italic>R. Yeru&#x1E25;am</italic>. Similarly, when the controversy is regarding the Synagogue where the Judge worships, he must renounce his interest in that Synagogue and worship in the other Synagogue; but when he attends his own Synagogue, although he can go to the other Synagogue, despite the fact that he renounces his interest in his Synagogue, he is still regarded as an interested party &#x2014; <italic>M.E. contra &#x2018;Ir Shushan</italic>. Moreover, the circumstances must be such that all the townspeople could be accomodated at the other Synagogue. Otherwise, the Judge would still be regarded as an interested party because the law is that townspeople who are in need of a Synagogue may compel each other to build one (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 163, 1) and consequently, the Judge will also have to contribute. Hence, if the other Synagogue is not large enough to accomodate all the worshippers of the disputed Synagogue, they are all considered interested parties, for they all desire to regain possession of their Synagogue. However, if the Judge&#x2019;s seat in the disputed Synagogue is his own property, he is not regarded as an interested party, provided the &#x2018;seven representatives of the town&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D1;&#x05E2;&#x05D4; &#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05D9; &#x05D4;&#x05E2;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;</span>) have no right to sell the Synagogue or the Torah scrolls for the needs of the community (v. Y.D. &#x00A7; 282). Otherwise, the Judge is always considered an interested party &#x2014; <italic>Tummim, A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn243">60) B.B. <italic>ibid.</italic> V., text <italic>supra</italic> n. 58. Yad, <italic>&#x2018;Eduth</italic> XV, 3. For they are pleased if the poor have a surplus because they will not be called upon to pay. Therefore, even if the Judge is willing to continue to make his regular contributions to the poor, and even if the judgment will be rendered in favour of the poor, yet, he is still regarded as an interested party.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn244">61) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>Asheri</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn245">62) By paying their assessment in advance no matter what the outcome of the case will be.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn246">63) Latter interpretation in B.B. <italic>ibid.</italic>: &#x2018;If you wish I can say that the poor literally are referred to and we deal with poor whose support rests upon the Judges (who are wealthy). How is this to be understood? If there is a fixed amount (for them to give), let two of them give their donation and then adjudicate the case (since they are thus no longer interested in the donation). We understand this to mean that there is no fixed amount (for them to donate, but the contribution is made only when the occasion arises. Hence, as long as there is still a possibility of collecting the money from the alleged culprit, they are still interested parties).&#x2019; It follows therefore, that just as in the case of a charitable contribution which is <italic>not fixed</italic>, renounciation is ineffective, so, too, in the case of a <italic>permanent tax</italic> it is impossible to establish with certainty that no benefit will be derived at some time or other. For it is impossible to know how long the person who is tried will live in order for the Judges to know how much they should pay as their share so as not to be regarded as interested parties &#x2014; <italic>B.Yos.</italic> It is only in the case of a special tax where the amount to be renounced may be established that renunciation is effective.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn247">64) B.B. 8b. V., text <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 2, n. 18; B.K. 116b: &#x2018;Ass-drivers are permitted to stipulate that one who loses his ass should be provided with another ass,&#x2019; i.e., even if it against the law. V., <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05E9;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>. However, if the Judges of a certain locality feel that other Judges from another town should be invited to try a case in their town, they should do so &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn248">65) B.K. <italic>ibid.</italic>: &#x2018;Our Rabbis taught: If a caravan was travelling through the wilderness and a troop of invading robbers threatened to pillage it, the contribution to be paid by each (in order to buy off the robbers) is calculated according to one&#x2019;s possessions (in the caravan), but not in accordance with the number of people there (because we assume that the invading robbers came originally for the possessions and not necessarily for the people). But if they hired a guide to go before them, the calculation has to be made also (<italic>also</italic> is wanting in Y. B.M. VI, 4(11a)) in accordance with the number of people in the caravan (because a guide is essential also to protect one&#x2019;s life) and they must not deviate from the general practice of the ass-drivers (i.e., if they stipulate to make the calculation according to possessions or persons, they may do so).&#x2019; The same applies to the general custom of mariners stated further <italic>ibid.</italic> Hence, we see that we follow the adopted practice although it is against the law. V., also Mishna B.M. VII, 1(83a) and Gemara a.l.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn250">1) San. 7b; A.Z. 52a: &#x2018;Resh Lakish stated: Whoever appoints an unworthy Judge over the community is as though he planted an <italic>Ashera</italic> in Israel, for it is written, <italic>Judges and officers shalt thou appoint thee</italic>, and near it is said, <italic>Thou shalt not plant thee an Ashera of any kind of tree</italic> (Deut.

<ftnote id="fn255">6) <italic>B.Yos. &#x2014; G.</italic> Derived from Shab. 139a: &#x2018;What is the meaning of the verse, <italic>The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, the sceptre of the rulers?</italic> (Is.

VII: &#x2018;R. Mani spoke with disrespect of those that get appointed to office for money. R. Imi would apply to them the Scriptural verse, <italic>gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you</italic> (Ex. XX, 20). Said R. Joshiah: His official cloak is as befitting to him as the packsaddle of an ass. Said R. Sheyan: For one who is appointed to office on account of money, one should not rise, nor is he called Rabbi etc.&#x2019; V., San. 7b: &#x2018;It is written: <italic>Ye shall not make with Me gods of silver or gods of gold</italic> (Ex. ibid.). Does it mean that only gods of silver and gold are not to be made, but those of wood are permissible? &#x2014; The verse, said R. Ashi, has reference to Judges appointed through the power of silver or gold.&#x2019; Cf. San. 63b: &#x2018;All scoffing is forbidden except the ridiculing of idols (by perverting their names).&#x2019; Hence, just as idolators may be treated irreverently, so also Judges who are appointed through the power of money. This refers to a Judge unversed in Jewish Law, but if he is learned in the Torah, even if there are others greater than he in that city, there would be no prohibition against rising in his presence, provided he did not buy his judgeship for money, but was appointed to office because he was wealthy. For if he paid money to be appointed, even if he is the most learned in the city, the prohibition stands. Thus <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic>. However, according to <italic>Tosaf.

(i.e., he must never force his way through the students who would sit on the floor, in order to reach his chair) &#x2014; It is written, <italic>Neither shalt thou go up by steps</italic> (i.e., force your way) <italic>upon My altar</italic> (Ex. XX, 26), and further it is stated, <italic>And these are the judgments</italic> (Ibid. XXI, 1).&#x2019; Hence the Judge or teacher or expositor of the law should arrive before the audience. And even nowadays when everyone sits on chairs or benches, the same procedure should be observed by the Judge or teacher &#x2014; <italic>M.E., ShaK</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn284">35) San. 8a: <italic>&#x2018;And I charged your judges at that time</italic> (Deut. I, 16); and further, <italic>I charged you at that time</italic> (Ibid. I, 18). R.

Furthermore, the feasting itself causes him to become entangled in disputes &#x2014; <italic>Rashi Maharsha</italic>).&#x2019; This applies to an ordinary scholar, much more so if one is appointed leader of a community to adjudicate suits and to render decisions that he must be on guard against the mentioned pitfalls.

This may be derived from the fact that we do not accept the testimony of the Court messenger alone in order to make the defendant pay for the expense of the Court warrant, much more so in the case of bodily punishment. Cf. B.K. 112b: &#x2018;The messenger of the Rabbis is as reliable (when informing the Court that the defendant refuses to appear) as two witnesses; this is the case only with reference to decreeing the ban (<italic>Shameta</italic>), but for writing a warrant (<italic>Pethi&#x1E25;a</italic>, at the defendant&#x2019;s expense), since he (the messenger) puts him (the recalcitrant defendant) to expense, &#x2014; for the latter has to pay the scribe (for drafting the writ of excommunication), it is not so (i.e., the Court messenger&#x2019;s statement is not as credible as the testimony of two witnesses)&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> V., <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 11, 1.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 9: THE PROHIBITION AGAINST TAKING BRIBES AND REGARDING PERMISSION TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF TIME. Contains eight paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. The Judge must be exceedingly<sup><xref rid="fn298">1</xref></sup> careful not to take a bribe even to acquit the innocent,<sup><xref rid="fn299">2</xref></sup> and if he accepted it, he must return it when the donor claims it.<sup><xref rid="fn300">3</xref></sup> Just as the one who receives it transgresses a negative command, so does the donor transgress [the negative command], &#x2018;Thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn301">4</xref></sup> And not only a bribe of money [is forbidden] but even a bribe of words [or acts].<sup><xref rid="fn302">5</xref></sup> Every Judge who borrows aught is ineligible to adjudicate the lawsuit of the owner of the lent object. This applies only when the Judge possesses naught to lend [to the latter], but if he had things to lend [to him],<sup><xref rid="fn303">6</xref></sup> he is fit [to adjudicate his case], since the latter too may borrow from him.<sup><xref rid="fn304">7</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: [<italic>This, viz., that the Judge who borrows is forbidden to pronounce judgment for the owner of the lent objcet applies</italic>] <italic>only when he is in the habit of borrowing from him, but</italic> [<italic>if the borowing is merely</italic>] <italic>incidental, and it is not evident that he does</italic> [<italic>this</italic>] <italic>on account of the</italic> [<italic>lender&#x2019;s</italic>] <italic>lawsuit, it is not</italic> [<italic>forbidden</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn305">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. If the claimant<sup><xref rid="fn306">9</xref></sup> sent a gift to the Judge beforehand, [i.e.,] before he [the Judge] summons the defendant to appear in Court, the latter cannot declare him [the Judge] unfit,<sup><xref rid="fn307">10</xref></sup> unless the Judge desires to refrain from [adjudicating] that lawsuit out of piety,<sup><xref rid="fn308">11</xref></sup> <italic>e.g., where</italic> [<italic>the Judge</italic>] <italic>knows that he has become well disposed towards this</italic> [<italic>donor</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn309">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. It was [formerly] customary to provide a fund<sup><xref rid="fn310">13</xref></sup> for the [members of the] Court, [i.e.,] they [the townspeople] undertake to pay a fixed sum of money for the maintenance of the Court, and they collect it [from the townspeople] at the beginning of the year or at the end thereof, and it does not bear the designation of a bribe or the designation of remuneration [for pronouncing judgment],<sup><xref rid="fn311">14</xref></sup> for it is obligatory for Israel to support its Judges and scholars.<sup><xref rid="fn312">15</xref></sup> In addition, if there are free-will offerings or undefined dedications<sup><xref rid="fn313">16</xref></sup> for a sacred purpose [available], they [the townspeople] may take therefrom [for the support of the Judges].<sup><xref rid="fn314">17</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>However, it is better to make the collection at the beginning of the year, so that</italic> [<italic>the money for their support</italic>] <italic>should be prepared for them</italic> [<italic>in advance</italic>] <italic>in order that they should not have to resort to flattery or be grateful to any person</italic> [<italic>during the year</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn315">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. Every Judge who sits [in his town] and [thus] increases the fees<sup><xref rid="fn316">19</xref></sup> of [his] scribes and beadles, is regarded as included among those who turn aside for lucre.<sup><xref rid="fn317">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. One who takes payment to act as a Judge, all the judgments that he pronounced are void,<sup><xref rid="fn318">21</xref></sup> unless it is knows that [in certain cases] he did not take payment [to act as Judge].<sup><xref rid="fn319">22</xref></sup> However, if he takes payment only [to compensate] the loss of his [regular] work, it is permissible, provided it is clearly evident to all that he takes payment only [to compensate] the loss of his [regular] work, e.g., where he [the Judge] has special work to execute at the time that he has to act as Judge<sup><xref rid="fn320">23</xref></sup> [and]<sup><xref rid="fn321">24</xref></sup> says to the litigants [before acting as their Judge], &#x2018;Give me payment for work [as compensation for my] specific occupation from which I will have to desist [during the adjudication of the lawsuit].&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn322">25</xref></sup> [Furthermore,] this [is permissible only] where he [the Judge] receives [payment] from both [litigants] in equal shares.<sup><xref rid="fn323">26</xref></sup> But if it not clearly evident [that he takes payment as compensation for loss of his work] e.g., <italic>where he has no special work</italic> [<italic>to execute</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn324">27</xref></sup> <italic>only</italic> that he says [to the litigants], &#x2018;Perhaps profit will accrue to me [while adjudicating your lawsuit] by purchasing goods [for trading, or through] brokerage,&#x2019; and on account of this [possible profit] he demands payments [from the litigants], it is forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn325">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. A Judge should not allow an uncultured disciple<sup><xref rid="fn326">29</xref></sup> to sit before him, so that he should not discuss the arguments with him and [thereby] turn aside from the way of truth.<sup><xref rid="fn327">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. A disciple who sits before his master and sees a point in favour of a poor man and the master wishes to pronounce him guilty, must plead in his [the poor man&#x2019;s] favour, and if he keeps silent he commits a sin on account of &#x2018;From a false matter keep far.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn328">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. A disciple who sits before his master and notices that he errs in the law, should not say, &#x2018;I will keep silent until he completes the adjudication and [then] I will upset his decision and build up [another] decision [of my own] so that [the decision] will be called by my name,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn329">32</xref></sup> but he should say to him in a respectful manner, &#x2018;Master, so and so you have taught me.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn330">33</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn298">1) Heb. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D0;&#x05D3; &#x05DE;&#x05D0;&#x05D3;</span> is employed to emphasize the extreme care that the Judge must take not to be tempted to accept bribes since man is endowed with a natural desire to accept gifts. The same expression is used by <italic>Tur</italic> in Y.D. &#x00A7; 160 beg. regarding the prohibition to take usury; <italic>ibid.</italic> &#x00A7; 336 beg. ref. to the physician who heals; <italic>Tur E.H.</italic> &#x00A7; 21 ref. to incest. Cf. Ab. IV, 4: &#x2018;Be exceedingly humble&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D0;&#x05D3; &#x05DE;&#x05D0;&#x05D9; &#x05D4;&#x05D5;&#x05D9; &#x05E9;&#x05E4;&#x05DC; &#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05D7;</span>), because by nature man is haughty &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> For any matter that involves the possibility of a material loss (in our case the gift or bribe that is given to the Judge which is forbidden) requires urging on since it is contrary to human nature not to accept. Cf. Sifra to Lev. VI, 2. V., <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 7, n. 33.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn299">2) Ket. 105a: &#x2018;Was it not taught: What was intimated by the text, <italic>And thou shalt take no gift?</italic> (Ex. XXIII, 8). If to teach that one must not acquit the guilty or that one must not condemn the innocent, (we may object because) it has already been stated in the Bible, <italic>Thou shalt not wrest judgment</italic> (Deut. XVI, 19). Hence, even if (the Judge wishes) to acquit the innocent or condemn the guilty, the Torah states, <italic>And thou shalt take no gift</italic>.&#x2019; <italic>Ibid.</italic> 105b: &#x2018;Why is it called <italic>Sho&#x1E25;ad</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05D7;&#x05D3;</span> taken as contraction of <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D4;&#x05D5;&#x05D0; &#x05D7;&#x05D3;</span>, it is one) ? &#x2014; Because it is one.&#x2019; (the recipient and the donor become one person). Cf. also Sifre to Deut. XVI, 19. The prohibition against accepting bribes refers not only to Judges but to all persons who are entrusted with communal matters although no adjudication of law is involved &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>. Likewise is it forbidden to accept equal bribes from both litigants although the foregoing reason no longer applies &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> The Judge must not accept any gifts from the acquitted party even after the conclusion of the trial &#x2014; <italic>Asheri</italic> to San. 27a in the case of Bar &#x1E24;ama.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn300">3) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXIII, 1. Derived from Tem. 4b: &#x2018;Abaye stated: Every act which the Divine Law prohibits, if it has been executed, the act has its legal effect; for if you were to entertain the opinion that the act does not have its legal effect why is one punished by lashes (on account thereof)? But Raba says that the act does not have its legal effect at all and the reason why one is punished by lashes is because he has transgressed a commandment of the Divine Law.&#x2019; After a number of texts are adduced according to which in some cases the transgression of a negative command has its legal effect while in others it does not,&#x2014; concerning which Abaye and Raba agree, &#x2014; the Talmud continues <italic>ibid.</italic> 6a-b: &#x2018;R. A&#x1E25;a, the son of Raba said to R. Ashi . . In what respect do Abaye and Raba differ? &#x2014; They differ with respect to direct usury (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05EA; &#x05E7;&#x05E6;&#x05D5;&#x05E6;&#x05D4;</span> i.e., lending four <italic>Denari</italic> in return for five) in accord with R. Eleazar. For R. Eleazar stated: Direct usury can be collected through the Judges, whereas indirect usury (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D1;&#x05E7; &#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;</span>, lit. &#x2018;dust of usury,&#x2019; e.g., if one sells his field and says to the buyer that if he pays him forthwith the price is one thousand Z<italic>uz</italic>, but if at a later date the price will be more. Consequently, if the buyer pays at the later date, the additional amount is regarded as indirect usury) cannot be collected through the Judges. R. Jo&#x1E25;anan states: Even direct usury is not collected through the Judges (Hence, Raba will conour with R. Eleazar and Abaye with R. Yo&#x1E25;anan). But do they (Abaye and Raba) differ merely in logical reasoning? Do they not differ in the interpretation of Biblical texts? For R. Isaac said: <italic>He hath given forth upon usury and had taken increase</italic>: <italic>shall he than live? He shall not live</italic> (Ez. XVIII, 13), which teaches that the taking of usury is a matter that concerns life but is not liable to restoration (consequently, even Raba who holds that a prohibited act does not have its legal effect, here he will admit that the act is valid on account of the text). R. A&#x1E25;a b. Adda says: From here: Scripture states, <italic>But fear thy G-d</italic> (Lev. XXV, 36), teaching that the taking of usury is a matter of fearing G-d, but is not liable to restoration. Raba stated: From here: <italic>He hath done all these abominations</italic>: <italic>he shall surely die</italic>: <italic>his blood shall be upon him</italic> (Ez. XVIII, 13). <italic>Now, lo, if he begat a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> XVIII, 10). Those who lend on interest are comparable to those who shed blood. Just as those who shed blood cannot make restoration (of the lost lives), so those who lend on interest are not liable to restoration (of interest). R. Na&#x1E25;man b. Isaac stated: What is the reason of R. Eleazar? (who maintains that direct usury is collectible through the Judges), for the Biblical text says: <italic>That thy brother may live with thee</italic> (Lev. XXV, 36) thus teaching that he must restore the interest so that he (the borrower) may live with you.&#x2019; Consequently, since the law rests with Raba (excluding certain cases), bribes are equated to usury and are collectible through the Judges, which means that the donor claims it. <italic>M.E.</italic> writes that if the donor does not claim the return of the gift, the Judge is not obliged to return it, because the donor gave it willingly for the purpose of being acquitted contrary to usury concerning which it is written <italic>That thy brother may live with thee</italic>. <italic>Ta</italic>Z disagrees with <italic>M.E.</italic> on the basis of <italic>Rashi</italic> to B.M. 61b, s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05F4;&#x05DB; &#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05EA; &#x05E7;&#x05E6;&#x05D5;&#x05E6;&#x05D4;</span> according to whom the Court may also compel him to return the usury only if he claimed it. Thus also <italic>Ta</italic>Z to Y.D. &#x00A7; 161, 5, n. 3. Even if the donor claimed the bribe after a considerable time had elapsed, yet, as long as he did not renounce his rights to it, he may still make a claim. However, it is proper that the recipient of the bribe should return it of his own accord if he wishes to do his duty towards G-d and repent &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn301">4) Lev. XIX, 14. Thus Yad <italic>ibid.</italic>, derived from the law of usury, for just as we deduce the law of returning bribes from the law of usury so too do we deduce from the law of usury that the one who gives bribes transgresses the negative injunction, <italic>And thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind</italic>, i.e., the one who offers a bribe tempts the Judge and thereby places a stumbling block before him. V., Mishna B.M. 75b: &#x2018;These transgress a negative injunction : the lender, the borrower, the surety and the witnesses. And the Sages add: the scribe too. They transgress the injunction, <italic>Thou shalt not give</italic> (<italic>him thy money upon usury</italic>) [Lev. XXV, 37] and <italic>Take thou</italic> (<italic>no usury</italic>) <italic>of him</italic> (Lev. XXV, 36) and <italic>Thou shalt not be to him as a usurer</italic> (Ex. XXII, 24) and <italic>Neither shall ye lay upon him usury</italic> (Ex. XXII, 25) and <italic>Thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind, but thou shalt fear thy G-d</italic>: <italic>I am the Lord</italic> (Lev. XIX, 14).&#x2019; Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic>: &#x2018;Abaye said: The lender transgresses all (the injunctions); the borrower: <italic>Thou shalt not cause thy brother to take usury</italic> (Deut. XXIII, 20. Heb. <span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05DA;</span> is in the <italic>Hiph&#x2018;il</italic> which is causitive. Hence, it refers to the debtor), <italic>but unto thy brother thou shalt offer no usury</italic> (ibid. v. 21), <italic>and thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind</italic>. The surety and the witnesses: only, <italic>neither shall ye lay upon him usury</italic>.&#x2019; One is forbidden to give a bribe to a Gentile Judge on the basis of <italic>and thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind</italic>, for civil laws are also binding upon all Noa&#x1E25;ides. But if it is evident that the Gentile Judge desires to pervert justice in favour of one of the litigants, it is permissible (<italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn302">5) Ket. 105b: &#x2018;Our Rabbis taught: <italic>And thou shalt take no bribe</italic>. (Ex. XXIII, 8); it was not necessary to speak of a monetary bribe, but (the following was intimated) : Even a bribe of words (or acts) is also prohibited, for it is not written, <italic>And thou shalt take no GAIN</italic> (Heb. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05E6;&#x05E2;</span> which would refer to a monetary bribe only).&#x2019; Cf. the cases of Samuel and Amemar a.o. mentioned <italic>ibid.</italic>, who refused to act as Judges for people who acted in a manner that would be tantamount to a bribe of words or acts. Cf. Y.D. &#x00A7; 161, where the same applies to usury. V., <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 7, n. 33.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn303">6) Even if he did not lend him anything as yet, for since he has things to lend him, the borrowing does not constitute a bribe &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn304">7) Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> par. 4. Derived from Ket. 105b: &#x2018;Rabbah b. R. Shilah said: Any Judge who is wont to borrow is ineligible to adjudicate a lawsuit (for the owner of the lent object). This applies only when he possessed naught to lend to others, but if he has things to lend it does not matter. But is this really so? Did not Raba borrow things from the household of Bar Merion though they borrowed naught from him? &#x2014; There he desired to make them feel important (i.e., the borrowing was not for his own benefit).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn305">8) <italic>MaHaRIK</italic> Rt. 16 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Since we compare the prohibition of bribes to that of usury, we likewise learn that a gift constitutes a bribe only when it is clearly evident that it was given for that purpose. V., B.M. 75b: &#x2018;It has been taught: R. Simeon b. Yo&#x1E25;ai stated: Whence is it derived that if one is his neighbour&#x2019;s creditor for a <italic>Maneh</italic>, the latter must not extend a greeting to him if he was not in the habit of doing this? &#x2014; From the Biblical verse, <italic>Usury of any word which may be usury</italic> (Deut. XXIII, 20), &#x2014; even speech is prohibited.&#x2019; Thus we see that it is forbidden only when the debtor was not in the habit of extending a greeting to the creditor, for then it is clearly evident that the purpose of the greeting is on account of the loan he received. But if it was his usual practice to extend a greeting, we consider the debtor&#x2019;s greeting as of a mere incidental nature. Cf. B.M. 64b, Tosaf. s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D1;&#x05DC; &#x05D7;&#x05E6;&#x05E8;</span>. Similarly in the present case. If the Judge was in the habit of borrowing, he is forbidden to adjudicate the case of the lender, but if he borrowed from him by mere chance, and it is not evident that the owner of the lent object does it on account of his lawsuit, the prohibition does not stand.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn307">10) Even if at the time he sent the gift, it was generally known that he has a claim to make &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> It must be clearly evident that the claimant sends the gift not on account of his lawsuit, but rather because it is his usual practice to send the Judge gifts &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn308">11) Geonic <italic>Responsum</italic> cited by <italic>Tur</italic>. Ket. 105b: &#x2018;A man once brought to R. Anan a bale of small fish living among the reeds in the swamps. What are you doing here, the latter inquired of him? I have a lawsuit, the other answered. (R. Anan) did not accept it from him. I am ineligible to try your suit. I do not require, the other said to him, your decision (in the case) ; accept (the gift) so as not to restrain me from offering my first-fruit? (v. Ex. XXIII, 19). For it was taught: <italic>And there came a man from Baal-shalishah and brought the man of G-d bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of corn in his sack</italic> (II Kings IV, 42) ; but was Elisha (who was not a <italic>Kohen</italic>. V., Pes. 68a and <italic>Asheri</italic> a.l.) permitted to eat first-fruit? &#x2014; This was meant to inform you that one who brings a gift to a scholar is regarded as if he had offered first-fruits. I had no intention to accept your gift (R. Anan) replied to him, but now that you have given me a reason, I will accept it. He then sent him to R. Na&#x1E25;man to whom he sent (the following message), Will the Master adjudicate (the lawsuit of) this man, for I, Anan, am ineligible to act as Judge for him.&#x2019; Legally, R. Anan was not disqualified to act as Judge since the gift was given to him before the writ of summons was sent to the other litigant, and the reason that he refused to act as Judge was an added stringency out of piety.

<ftnote id="fn317">20) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXIII, 3.

This means that they did not emulate their father&#x2019;s example. For Samuel the righteous used to go around among all the places of Israel and judge them in their towns, as it is said, <italic>And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel</italic> (ibid. VII, 16). However, they (his sons) did not do this, but sat in their towns in order to increase the fees of their beadles (who summoned the litigants to court) and scribes&#x2019; (who kept the records of evidences, minutes of court proceedings or wrote the documents referring to the choice of arbiters and the like).

<ftnote id="fn318">21) Mishna Bek. IV, 6(29a): &#x2018;If a man takes payment to act as a Judge, his judgments are void.&#x2019; Gemara: &#x2018;How do we know this? &#x2014; Rab Judah stated on the authority of Rab: The Biblical verse says, <italic>Behold I have taught you</italic> etc., (Deut. IV, 5). Just as I teach gratuitously, so must you teach gratuitously. It was likewise taught thus: Scripture states: <italic>Even as the Lord my G-d commanded me</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic>) &#x2014; (i.e.,) just as I teach gratuitously, so must you teach gratuitously.&#x2019; <italic>Tosef</italic> (Z). Bek. III, 8: &#x2018;One who is suspected (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05D7;&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;</span>) of taking payment and (then) judges; (or taking payment) and (then) gives evidence, all the judgments that he pronounced and all the evidences that he gave are void.&#x2019; Cf. also Y. San. I, 1(18b) beg. Thus also <italic>RaN</italic> to Kid. II end, since the Mishna <italic>ibid.</italic> states <italic>&#x2018;his judgments&#x2019;</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;</span>) and not <italic>&#x2018;his judgment&#x2019;</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;</span>). In the light of these sources we may say that not only where we know for certain that he received payment for pronouncing judgment, but also with respect to those regarding which we may entertain a suspicion that payment was taken by the Judge, we rule that they are null and void. Hence, it follows that where we know for certain that the Judge did not take payment for his decision, the judgment is binding. <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic> writes that if the Judge took payment for adjudication, <italic>legally</italic> he does not have to return the money. It is only when he received money as a bribe that he is obliged to return it, for in the latter case an explicit Biblical principle has been transgressed (v. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1). Others maintain <italic>contra Ba&#x1E24;</italic> that even when accepted as payment, it must be returned &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>. The judgments are regarded as void only from the moment we discover that the Judge took payment to act as Judge, for we say that only now has his status been impaired &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth</italic>. The adopted practice for both parties to give the Judge aught prior to the pronouncement of judgment dates back to former times when a communal measure was in vogue, enacted originally for the maintenance of the Judges. Hence, even nowadays when a Rabbi or Judge is appointed by a community it is as though a stipulation were made with the community to pay something to the Judge to pronounce judgment, since this was the original custom &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth</italic>. The other Judges of the Court are not disqualified on account of the Judge who took payment to pronounce judgment. Furthermore, his decision are null and void only with respect to discretionary judgment (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05D0; &#x05D3;&#x05D3;&#x05F2;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;</span>), i.e., where the Judges use their discretion to which of the litigants to adjudicate the claim, but not in the case where an explicit law is involved &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn319">22) I.e., that particular decision is binding, although he took payment for other judgments before or after this. This should not be compared to the case of one who transgressed a Biblical injunction where the law is that all his judgments and evidences are void until he repents, for here it is different since he did not transgress any Biblical principle and the fact that his judgments or evidences are regarded void is merely a penalty imposed by the Sages &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Cf. previous note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn320">23) Ket. 105a in the case of Karna who received compensation for loss of work that could be ascertained since he was engaged in smelling tests at wine stores for which he was paid a fee. Similarly, in connection with R. Huna a.l.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn321">24) Thus <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn322">25) This law holds good if the Judge made this stipulation before he tries the case, but not if he demands compensation for loss of work after pronouncing judgment. In the latter case he may receive only as much as a labourer in that line would ask for stopping work in which he was engaged (which would be less than he would earn by working), as in the case of one who returns a lost article (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 264; &#x00A7; 265; Y.D. &#x00A7; 177; &#x00A7; 312) &#x2014; <italic>M.E. Ta</italic>Z disagrees with <italic>M.E.</italic> and holds that if no stipulation was made at the outset, he is not entitled even to compensation given for an idle labourer, for the litigant may say, &#x2018;Had I known this, I would have taken my lawsuit to another Judge who would not have to interrupt his work.&#x2019; Thus also <italic>Tummim</italic> and <italic>Nethiboth. Shebuth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> agrees with <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn323">26) Ket. <italic>ibid.</italic>, where it is stated that Karna took equal shares from both litigants. Cf. Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXIII, 5 and <italic>Kesef Mishneh</italic> a.l. according to whom this is also derived from Ket. <italic>ibid.</italic> in connection with R. Huna who &#x2018;used to say (to the litigants), Provide me with one who will draw water (to irrigate my fields) in my stead, and I will pronounce judgment for you.&#x2019; Hence, he must have spoken to both litigants.</ftnote>

If he has a specific occupation or he is a skilled worker, although when the litigants come to him with their lawsuit he is unemployed, nevertheless, <italic>ex post facto</italic> the decision holds good &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> If the Judge has to travel to another locality in order to try a case, he is permitted to set his fee for travelling expenditures for this does not constitute payment for acting as a Judge. Likewise, even if the Judge is obliged to go to another home to try a case, he is permitted to receive payment for his trouble &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> The entire ruling here has reference to Judges who were not permanently appointed by the community; but those who were appointed to act as permanent Judges are permitted to take equal shares of payment from the litigants.

<ftnote id="fn329">32) Sheb. 31a: &#x2018;Whence do we know that a disciple who sees his master erring in the law should not say, I will wait until he completes (the adjudication) and (then) I will upset his decision and build up (another decision) of my own, so that the decision should be called by my name?

<ftnote id="fn330">33) Cf. the following sources: San. 99b: On the meaning of <italic>Epikoros</italic> who according to the Mishna (<italic>ibid.</italic> 90a) has no portion in the world to come, it is stated: &#x2018;E.g., one who was sitting before his master when the discussion was directed to some other subject, and the disciple said, We said thus on the matter, instead of, Thou master has said.&#x2019; Hence, we see that it is proper for the disciple to make his statement in a respectful manner so as to give credit to his master and not to himself. <italic>Ibid.</italic> 80b-81a: &#x2018;Samuel said to Rab Judah: You keen scholar, do not speak to your father thus (i.e., to distinctly tell him that he erred). For it has been taught: If one was (unintentionally) transgressing a precept of the Torah, his son should not say, Father you transgressed a Biblical precept, but say&#x2026; Father, the following verse is written in the Torah&#x2019; (by stating the verse indirectly his father will not be put to shame). Hence, this applies much more so in the case of his master, because the accepted principle is that respect for one&#x2019;s teacher takes precedence over respect for one&#x2019;s father (v. B.M. 33a). &#x1E24;ag. 14b: &#x2018;(R. Eleazar b. &#x2018;Arak) said to him (R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b.

<p>1.

<p>2. Every [Judge] before whom a lawsuit comes and he compares it to another case that had already come before him<sup><xref rid="fn336">6</xref></sup> and gave a decision [by analogy] whilst there is with him in the [same] town [a scholar who] is greater than he in wisdom and he fails to consult him [in the present case], is regarded as included among the wicked who give decisions in haughtiness.<sup><xref rid="fn337">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. &#x2019;For she hath cast down many wounded,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn338">8</xref></sup> refers to a scholar who has not attained [the age of] ordination, and [yet,] renders decisions; &#x2018;Yea, a mighty host are her slain,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn338">8</xref></sup> refers to one who has attained [the age of] ordination, but avoids giving decisions,<sup><xref rid="fn339">9</xref></sup> provided [his] generation has need of him.<sup><xref rid="fn340">10</xref></sup> However, if he knew that there is [another scholar available] there [who is] fit to render decisions, and [on account of this] he refrains from giving decisions, he is considered praiseworthy.<sup><xref rid="fn341">11</xref></sup> Whosoever refrains from [trying] a lawsuit avoids enmity and robbery and a vain oath.<sup><xref rid="fn342">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 11: IN WHICH MANNER IS ONE SUMMONED BEFORE COURT AND THROUGH WHOM? Contains six paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. In which manner is a defendant summoned to appear in Court? &#x2014; The [members of the] Court send their messenger to him in order that he come on the appointed day to Court. [If] he did not appear [on the appointed day], they summon him a second time; [if] he did not appear [after the second summons], they summon him a third time; [if] he [still] did not appear, they wait for him all day, and if he did not appear, they place him under the ban on the morrow.<sup><xref rid="fn344">1</xref></sup> When does this apply? &#x2014; In [the case of one] who was in country towns and departs from and returns to [the city],<sup><xref rid="fn345">2</xref></sup> but [in the case of one] who is usually in the city, only one date is fixed for him [in a legal summons],<sup><xref rid="fn346">3</xref></sup> and if he did not appear on that entire day, they place him under the ban on the morrow.<sup><xref rid="fn347">4</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: [<italic>If</italic>] <italic>the</italic> [<italic>members of the</italic>] <italic>Court went to another place, he</italic> [<italic>the defendant</italic>] <italic>is required to go after them</italic> [<italic>in order to be tried before them</italic>], <italic>and if he did not go, they place him under the ban.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn348">5</xref></sup> The Court messenger is relied upon to state,<sup><xref rid="fn349">6</xref></sup> &#x2018;[The defendant] behaved insolently towards me<sup><xref rid="fn350">7</xref></sup> or towards the Judge<sup><xref rid="fn351">8</xref></sup> or refused to appear for trial,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn349">6</xref></sup> and they decree the <italic>Shammeta,</italic><sup><xref rid="fn352">9</xref></sup> (<italic>i.e., the ban or excommunication</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn352">9</xref></sup> [<italic>the etymology of Shammeta being</italic>], &#x2018;<italic>there is death</italic>&#x2019;),<sup><xref rid="fn353">10</xref></sup> against him on his [the Court messenger&#x2019;s] testimony, but we do not write a warrant of excommunication on his [the messenger&#x2019;s testimony] until two witnesses appear and testify that he [the defendant] refused to come.<sup><xref rid="fn354">11</xref></sup> The messenger of Court is not held responsible in reporting [this] information on grounds of slander.<sup><xref rid="fn355">12</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>One who states that he is not afraid of the Court order or the Sage</italic>, &#x2014; [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>although he does appear in Court</italic> [<italic>for trial</italic>], <italic>they place him under the ban, for since he states that he comes not on account of the</italic> [<italic>Court</italic>] <italic>order, it is regarded as contempt of the law</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn356">13</xref></sup> <italic>V., Y.D. &#x00A7; 334</italic>, [<italic>par. 43</italic>]. <italic>If he stated, &#x2018;I do not wish to be tried before you, only before another Court,&#x2019; v., infra &#x00A7; 14</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn357">14</xref></sup> <italic>One who is not able to come to Court because he is required to go to distant countries, should inform the Court thereof, and make excuses</italic> [<italic>for the postponement of the trial</italic>] <italic>and request another date</italic> [<italic>for the hearing</italic>], <italic>and if he did not do</italic> [<italic>this</italic>] <italic>they place him under the ban, although he was not able to come</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn358">15</xref></sup> <italic>One who accepted</italic> [<italic>to be tried before</italic>] <italic>a Court of two by making an agreement by means of a Kinyan</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn359">16</xref></sup> <italic>and they summoned him and he did not appear</italic>, &#x2014; [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>they</italic> [<italic>have the power to</italic>] <italic>place him under the ban as</italic><sup><xref rid="fn360">17</xref></sup> <italic>a Court of three</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn361">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. A [Court] messenger who stated, &#x2018;So-and-so has sent me [to summon you to Court]&#x2019; in the name of one of the Judges,<sup><xref rid="fn362">19</xref></sup> and [the defendant] refused to come, &#x2014; [the law is that] they do not write against him a warrant of excommunication<sup><xref rid="fn363">20</xref></sup> until he [the messenger] states [this] in the name of the three [Judges]. <italic>And if there is among them an expert</italic> [<italic>Judge</italic>], <italic>they accord him honour and one</italic> [<italic>the Court messenger</italic>] <italic>mentions to him</italic> [<italic>only</italic>] <italic>the name of the expert</italic> [<italic>Judge</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn364">21</xref></sup> When does this apply? &#x2014; Where the [Court] messenger went [to summon the defendant] on an [ordinary] day that is not known [to be appointed] for a judicial session, but [if] on the day that is known [to be appointed as a Court-day] when the Judges sit in judgment, everyone knows that all the Judges are assembled [at their meeting place] and although the [Court] messenger came [to summon the defendant] in the name of one [Judge],<sup><xref rid="fn365">22</xref></sup> it is as though he came in the name of the three [Judges].<sup><xref rid="fn366">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. One who is [a resident] in a city<sup><xref rid="fn367">24</xref></sup> and the Court messenger went [to convey to him a legal summons] and did not find him [at home] &#x2014; [the law is that] they do not fix for him a time [to appear in Court] until the [Court] messenger finds him and informs him thereof.<sup><xref rid="fn368">25</xref></sup> [If] he was in a country town [away from home], &#x2014; [then] if it is customary for him to come [home] on that very same day, the [Court] messenger may say even to one of the neighbours [of the defendant], even [if it be] a woman, &#x2018;If So-and-so comes [home today] inform him that the Court of Law has fixed a time for him, [viz.,] that he appear today in the Court of Law;&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn369">26</xref></sup> and if he does not come [to Court] they place him under the ban in the evening.<sup><xref rid="fn370">27</xref></sup> <italic>And so much the more</italic> [<italic>if he was summoned</italic>] <italic>by the Court messenger</italic> [<italic>himself</italic>], <italic>although he</italic> [<italic>the Court messenger</italic>] <italic>did not return</italic> [<italic>to Court</italic>] <italic>and state, &#x2018;I have carried out my commission</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn371">28</xref></sup> When does this apply [viz., that we place him under the ban]? &#x2014; Where [it is known that] he [the defendant on returning home] via the route that he is accustomed to take, does not [pass] by the locality of the Court of Law; but if his route [goes] by them [viz., the members of the Court of Law], they do not place him under the ban until the [Court] messenger himself conveys [the summons] to him, for fear that the neighbours had not informed him thereof, for they might think [that since] his route [passes] by the door of the Court of Law, he had already passed by them<sup><xref rid="fn372">29</xref></sup> [and the summons was conveyed to him] and [then] he left. Likewise, if he did not arrive in the city until the next day, we do not rely upon the neighbours, for fear that they forgot and did not inform him thereof. <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>So too, if he was in the city, we do not rely upon the neighbours, since they might think that perhaps the Court messenger found him and had</italic> [<italic>already</italic>] <italic>conveyed</italic> [<italic>the summons</italic>] <italic>to him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn373">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. One against whom a [warrant of] excommunication had been written for failure to appear [before Court]<sup><xref rid="fn374">31</xref></sup> and [subsequently the defaulter] stated, &#x2018;I will appear,&#x2019; &#x2014; we do not destroy the writ of excommunication until he [actually] appears. However, one against whom a [warrant of] excommunication had been written for having refused to obey a Court order,<sup><xref rid="fn375">32</xref></sup> &#x2014; [then] as soon as [the defaulter] states, &#x2018;I hereby obligate myself to obey the Court order,&#x2019; we destroy the warrant of excommunication,<sup><xref rid="fn376">33</xref></sup> and [the defaulter] pays the expense of the Scribe [for drafting the writ of excommunication].<sup><xref rid="fn377">34</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>One against whom they</italic> [<italic>the members of the Court</italic>] <italic>wrote a</italic> [<italic>document of</italic>] <italic>refusal, and subsequently he pleaded that he did not hear</italic> [<italic>about it</italic>], <italic>is not relied upon, because the action of the Court ensures publicity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn378">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. [With regards to] noble women <italic>or a scholar whose sole occupation is the study of the Torah,</italic><sup><xref rid="fn379">36</xref></sup> &#x2014; whether they are summoned to appear [in person] in Court, and likewise, whether the defendant can appoint a deputy to take his place before the Court, &#x2014; will be explained in &#x00A7; 96 and in &#x00A7; 124.</p>
<p>6. The Judge can sign on a document containing a summons at the side.<sup><xref rid="fn380">37</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn344">1) M.K. 16a: &#x2018;Raba said: Whence do we derive that we send a Court messenger (in a legal summons) ? &#x2014; For it is written, <italic>And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab</italic> (Num. XVI, 12). Whence do we derive that we summon him to appear (in person) ? &#x2014; For it is written, <italic>And Moses said to Korah, Be thou and all thy congregation before the Lord, thou and Aaron</italic> (<italic>tomorrow</italic>) (<italic>ibid.</italic> v. 16). (Whence that one is to appear) before a distinguished personage? &#x2014; For it is written, <italic>Before the Lord</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> v. 16). (That both parties should be named) thou and So-and-so? &#x2014; For it is written, <italic>Thou and they</italic> (that are with them) <italic>and Aaron</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> v. 16). That we appoint a time? &#x2014; For it is written, <italic>Tomorrow</italic> (<italic>ibid</italic>.). One term and then another term (after one more term) ? &#x2014; <italic>They called there, Pharaoh the king of Egypt,</italic> (the cause of) <italic>commotion; he hath let the appointed time pass by;</italic> (<italic>As I live, saith the King, the Lord of Hosts, surely like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come</italic>) (Jer. XLVI, 17-18. V., <italic>Rashi</italic> and <italic>Targum</italic> a.l.)&#x2019; That he is placed under the ban only after the third summons is derived from <italic>Tosaf.</italic> a.l., s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05EA;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05DF;</span> in accord with the opinion of &#x2018;some explain.&#x2019; Thus also <italic>Tur.</italic> Cf. also B.K. 113a: &#x2018;R. &#x1E24;isda said: (In a legal summons) we appoint a time for the person to appear) on Monday, (then) on Thursday, and (then) on (the following) Monday (The <italic>Beth Din</italic> held its sessions on Mondays and Thursdays &#x2014; B.K. 82a), (i.e.,) one term and then another term after one more term (in case of failing to appear) and on the morrow (of the last fixed) we write (the <italic>Pethi&#x1E25;a</italic>).&#x2019; V., <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 8, 5, n. 45. The defendant has a right to say to the claimant before appearing in Court, &#x2018;Tell me the nature of your claim,&#x2019; and if the claimant refuses to comply with his request, the defendant can say, &#x2018;I will not go to Court with you until you tell me, for it is quite possible that when I hear your claim I will settle with you and indemnify you&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>ShaK contra Be&#x2019;er Sheba.</italic> In the latter case, the defendant should report the claimant&#x2019;s refusal to disclose the nature of his claim to the Court messenger &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> The expenses for the summons should be defrayed by the claimant and not by the defendant &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> The claimant can summon the defendant to appear only on the days that Court sessions are held according to the adopted custom of the community unless the local usage is to hold a Court session whenever the need arises. The writ of summons, however, may be sent to the defendant at any time for it has no fixed time &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn345">2) For there may have been unavoidable circumstances which prevented the defendant from appearing after the first two summonses were sent. Where, however, he does not habitually depart from and return to the city, only that he spends a week or two away from home in the country towns or villages, it seems that he does not come under this ruling, and they appoint a time for him to appear for trial in accordance with his preoccupation &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn346">3) Thus <italic>Tur</italic> and Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXV, 8, derived from B.K. 113a: &#x2018;R. Assi happened to be at R. Kahana&#x2019;s and saw that a certain woman was summoned to appear before the Court on the preceding evening (and when she failed to appear) he wrote a <italic>Pethi&#x1E25;a</italic> against her on the following morning. He then said to R. Kahana: Does not the Master hold the opinion of R. &#x1E24;isda (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 1)&#x2026; He replied: This has reference only to a man who might be prevented by an unavoidable interference, through being out of town, but a woman who is (always) in town and if she fails to appear, is regarded contumacious (after the first act of refusal).&#x2019; The adopted custom nowadays is to send three summonses even for one who is in town (<italic>Tummim, Nethiboth</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn347">4) Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> has <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05E2;&#x05E8;&#x05D1;</span> &#x2018;in the evening.&#x2019; V., <italic>infra</italic> par. 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn348">5) <italic>B.Yos.</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G. Tur</italic> and Yad do not state this law and on the basis of the Mishna in R.H. 31b [&#x2018;should the Head of the Court be in another place, the witnesses (who give evidence for the New Moon) should still go only to the place of Assembly (and the Court declares the sanctification of the New Moon without the Head&#x2019;)], <italic>R. Moses Ibn &#x1E24;abib</italic> in his <italic>Shamoth ba-Are&#x1E93;</italic> rejects the present ruling of <italic>Isserles</italic>. For the law (R.H. <italic>ibid</italic>.) rests with R. Ashi that all laws are comparable in this respect to the sanctification of the New Moon, <italic>contra</italic> Amemar (<italic>ibid</italic>.) who distinguishes between the sanctification of the New Moon and other laws, because in the former case, the witnesses would refrain from giving evidence were we to insist that they go to the place of the Head, but in other cases, <italic>the borrower is a servant to the lender</italic> (Prov. XXII, 7). Hence, since the law rests with R. Ashi, <italic>Isserles</italic>&#x2019; ruling must be rejected. Other authorities defend <italic>Isserles</italic> &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> According to <italic>A.H., Isserles</italic>&#x2019; ruling would apply only in a case where the defendant does not live in the same locality as the Judge, and if the Judge or the Court are in a different locality now, and the defendant, who was originally summoned to appear for trial in the first place, is not any further away from the second place, he must appear, otherwise he is placed under the ban.</ftnote>

Maim.</italic> Yad, <italic>Talmud Torah</italic> VII, 2 maintains that they are identical. <italic>N</italic> in <italic>Mishpat ha-&#x1E24;erem</italic> claims that <italic>Shammeta</italic> is a general term for <italic>Niddui</italic> and <italic>&#x1E24;erem.</italic> Cf.

But if he says: Give me time until I produce witnesses and invalidate the document, we give him time. If he comes (with witnesses), then he comes; but if he does not come we wait for him (the following) Monday and Thursday and Monday. If he still does not come we write a <italic>Pethi&#x1E25;a</italic> against him (that goes into effect after) ninety days. For the first thirty days we do not go down (to take possession of his property) since we say that he is busy trying to borrow money; during the following thirty days we likewise do not go down to take possession of his property, as we say perhaps he was unable to raise a loan and is trying to sell his property; the last thirty days we likewise do not go down to take possession of his property since we may still say that the purchaser (of his property) is busy himself trying to raise money. If he still does not come (after all this), we write an <italic>Adrakta</italic> (legal permission to a creditor to trace the debtor&#x2019;s property for the purpose or having it seized, assessed, offered for public sale and eventually delivered to him) on his property.&#x2019; Hence, we see that although he is unavoidably prevented from producing witnesses in which case we give him time to bring proof, yet, he must appear before Court to justify the delay; otherwise, the ban is decreed against him. Cf. also <italic>ibid.</italic> 113a: &#x2018;Raba said: If a <italic>Pethi&#x1E25;a</italic> was written against a recalcitrant offender for not coming before Court, we do not destroy it so long as he does not come before the Court&#x2026; this however, is not so; for as soon as he states his intention to obey, we must destroy the <italic>Pethi&#x1E25;a</italic>.&#x2019;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn363">20) V. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1 and notes. Actually even without writing the warrant of excommunication we do not place the defendant under the ban unless the statements conflict, i.e., if the Court messenger says that he summoned the defendant in the name of the three Judges and the latter denies this in which case we place the defendant under the ban but do not write a warrant (<italic>Pethi&#x1E25;a</italic>).

Derived from San. 8a: &#x2018;For Raba said: When three Judges sit in judgment and the Court messenger went and served the summons in the name of one only, his statement is void, until he stated it in the name of all the (three Judges). This, however, has reference only to an ordinary day; but on a Court-day (i.e., Mondays and Thursdays. V., B.K. 82a) it is not necessary.&#x2019; <italic>A.H.</italic> writes that it is only when the Court has fixed days during which judicial sessions are held that it is not necessary to summon the defendant in the name of all the Judges, for since there is a set time for the Judges to sit in judgment, the defendant knows that all the Judges are in session; but if judicial sessions are conducted every day, the Court messenger must summon him in the name of all the Judges (or in the name of the recognized authority). Otherwise the defendant may state that &#x2018;since the Court messenger summoned me in the name of one Judge, I thought that the other Judges were not in session today.&#x2019; <italic>A.H.</italic> also states that there are some localities where the Court messenger summons the defendant in the name of the litigant as follows : &#x2018;So-and-so summons you to appear in Court.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn367">24) Heb. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D4;</span>. Lit. &#x2018;a province.&#x2019; However, <italic>Maim.,</italic> on the basis of numerous Talmudic references employs this term in the sense of &#x2018;a large city&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn368">25) For even if the neighbours were informed thereof they will think that perhaps the messenger met him and informed him himself. V., <italic>Gloss</italic> at the end of this ruling which has reference to this law, and cf. <italic>infra</italic> n. 30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn369">26) For we presume that they carried out their commission &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn370">27) Thus Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXV, 10. However, in Yad <italic>ibid.,</italic> par. 8, <italic>Maim</italic>. in stating the law, a) of one who was in the city (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05E2;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;</span>) and did not appear in Court after receiving a legal summons, has &#x2018;<span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05E2;&#x05E8;&#x05D1;</span>,&#x2019; i.e., he is placed under the ban the very same day in the evening; yet, in the same par., when stating the law of one who was in a country town (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05DB;&#x05E4;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>) and did not appear in Court even after the third summons, <italic>Maim.,</italic> has &#x2018;<span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05D3; &#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05E8;</span>,&#x2019; i.e., he is placed under the ban only on the morrow. On the other hand, <italic>Caro</italic> has both in a) and b) <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05E8;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;</span>, i.e., on the morrow and in the present ruling has <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05E2;&#x05E8;&#x05D1;</span> in the evening. The following explanation is advanced in order to remove the apparent discrepancy. In Yad <italic>ibid.,</italic> par. 8, both in a) and b), we are informed that the party is not placed under the ban before the end of the day. In a) <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05E2;&#x05E8;&#x05D1;</span> (in the evening) is used, i.e., the beginning of the following day; in b) <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05D3; &#x05DC;&#x05E2;&#x05E8;&#x05D1;</span> (on the morrow) is used, i.e., the morrow of the following day. The reason why <italic>Maim</italic>. uses both terms is in order to teach us the remarkable feature of this law, viz., in a) where only one day is given to him to appear in Court, since he is in the city, consequently, we adopt a stringency and pronounce the ban at the <italic>beginning</italic> of the following day, i.e., &#x2018;in the evening;&#x2019; in b) where he departs from and returns to the city in which case we give the defendant three terms, we adopt a leniency and give him time until the morning of the following day. Hence, the term <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05D3; &#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05E8;</span> (until the morrow). Since, therefore, legally there is no difference, for both terms refer to the next day, <italic>Tur</italic> has only <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05E8;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;</span> &#x2018;on the morrow,&#x2019; and he is followed by <italic>Caro</italic> in rulings a) and b), who also has <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05E8;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;</span>. It is quite possible however, that in par. 1 <italic>supra, Caro</italic> also holds that the ban is pronounced in the evening, but the reason he mentions <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05E8;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;</span> (on the morrow) is merely to inform us that on the morrow they publicize the fact that the defendant had been placed under the ban on the preceding evening, and in our present ruling, <italic>Caro</italic> simply states the law of decreeing the ban in the evening following <italic>Maim.</italic> &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> V., however, <italic>W.G.</italic> and <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu</italic> a.l. for further comments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn371">28) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> For we might have thought that if he does not return to the Court of Law to inform them that he had carried out their commission there is the possibility that the party was not informed thereof &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn372">29) Thus Yad.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn373">30) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> The entire ruling here is found in Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXV, 10, derived from B.K. 112b-113a: &#x2018;Rabina said: We may serve a legal summons through the mouth of a woman or through the mouth of neighbours; this applies only to a case where the (defendant) was then not in town, but if he was at that time in town, it is not so, for it is possible that they (i.e., the woman or the neighbours or according to <italic>A.H.</italic> this has reference even to the defendant&#x2019;s wife and children) might not convey the summons to him, thinking that the Court messenger will find him and transmit it to him. Furthermore, this ruling applies only when the party would not be passing by the Court of Law, but if he should have to pass by the door of the Court of Law, this is not so, since they (i.e., the woman or the neighbours) might think that at the Court of Law they will find him first and convey the summons to him. Again, this applies only if the party was due home on the very same day, but if he does not come home on the same day, it is not so, because we say that they surely forgot it completely.&#x2019; <italic>Isserles</italic>&#x2019; <italic>Gloss</italic> here is merely stated for the purpose of adducing the Talmudic reason for not relying on the neighbours in the case where the defendant was a resident in a city, and refers to the first part of <italic>Caro&#x2019;s</italic> ruling. Otherwise, this <italic>Gloss</italic> would be redundant since the term <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D4;</span> employed in Yad (and followed here by <italic>Caro</italic>) also means <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;</span> (i.e., a city) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Cf. <italic>supra</italic> n. 25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn374">31) Which is considered contempt of the Law.</ftnote>

(Likewise,) if (the <italic>Pethi&#x1E25;a</italic> was written) for not having complied with the Law, &#x2014; (then) until he complies with the Law, we do not destroy it. This, however, is not so: for as soon as he states, &#x201C;I intend to obey,&#x201D; we destroy the <italic>Pethi&#x1E25;a</italic> (forthwith, because he might not have had money now, but failure to appear in Court is considered contumacious).&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn377">34) B.K. 112b in accord with Rabina. Cf. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 8, n. 45.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 12: A JUDGE BEFORE WHOM APPEARED FOR TRIAL A WEAK AND A POWERFUL LITIGANT AND ALL THE LAWS OF ARBITRATION. Contains twenty paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. When two [litigants] appear before you for trial, one weak [in influence], the other powerful [in influence], so long as you have not heard their pleas or [even after you have heard their pleas, &#x2014; [so long as] you are in doubt which way the judgment will incline, you may say to them, &#x2018;I am not bound to try your case,&#x2019; lest the one of powerful [influence] be pronounced guilty and persecute the Judge.<sup><xref rid="fn381">1</xref></sup> However, if you have [already] heard their pleas, and you know which way the judgment will incline,<sup><xref rid="fn382">2</xref></sup> you may not say [to them], &#x2018;I am not bound to try your case.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn383">3</xref></sup> And if he was appointed [to serve as Judge] for the public, he is obliged to try their case.<sup><xref rid="fn384">4</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>So too, if they were both powerful</italic> [<italic>litigants</italic>] <italic>he is required to try their case</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn385">5</xref></sup> <italic>There is, however, an</italic> [<italic>authority</italic>] <italic>who writes that at present it is nevertheless the adopted practice not to interfere with violators</italic> [<italic>of the law</italic>] <italic>because there is danger in</italic> [<italic>this</italic>] <italic>matter lest he</italic> [<italic>the violator</italic>] <italic>get him into trouble with the government</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn386">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. It is a religious duty to say to the litigants at the outset, &#x2018;Do you wish [to resort to] law or [to submit to] arbitration?&#x2019; If they consented [to submit to] arbitration, they bring about a settlement between them.<sup><xref rid="fn387">7</xref></sup> And just as [the Judge] is cautioned not to pervert judgment, so too, is he cautioned not to direct the arbitration [in favour of] one party more than the other.<sup><xref rid="fn388">8</xref></sup> Every Court of Law that always brings about a settlement is considered praiseworthy.<sup><xref rid="fn387">7</xref></sup> When does this apply?<sup><xref rid="fn389">9</xref></sup> &#x2014; Before the conclusion of the trial, &#x2014; even though one has heard their pleas and knows which way the judgment will incline, &#x2014; it is a religious duty to attempt a settlement;<sup><xref rid="fn390">10</xref></sup> but after the Judge concluded the trial and made the pronouncement, &#x2018;So-and-so, you are innocent, So-and-so, you are guilty,&#x2019; he is not permitted to attempt a settlement between them.<sup><xref rid="fn391">11</xref></sup> However, another person who is not a Judge is permitted to attempt a settlement between them,<sup><xref rid="fn392">12</xref></sup> [provided] that this is not [attempted] in a Court sitting that is appointed for the purpose [of holding] legal [sessions].<sup><xref rid="fn393">13</xref></sup> If the Court of Law imposed an oath upon one of them, the Court of Law is permitted to bring about a settlement between them [even after the conclusion of the trial],<sup><xref rid="fn394">14</xref></sup> so that [the one who is bound to take an oath] should be exempt from the responsibility thereof.<sup><xref rid="fn395">15</xref></sup> <italic>The Court of Law cannot compel one to fall in with</italic> [<italic>the principle of equity, i.e., actting</italic>] <italic>beyond the requirements of the line of justice, although that would appear to them to be the proper thing</italic> [<italic>to do</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn396">16</xref></sup> <italic>However, some differ with</italic> [<italic>this opinion</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn397">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. It is permissible for the Court of Law to forgo [certain] rights in property belonging to orphans [provided this is carried out by a settlement] out of Court in order to set them at peace from [entering into future] disputes.<sup><xref rid="fn398">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. The Court of Law has the power to issue a decree and to pronounce the ban so that the settlement be carried out and that the orphans should not be able to protest [against the settlement] when they reach their majority.<sup><xref rid="fn399">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. The Judge has the power to adjudicate a lawsuit [in a manner] similar to a settlement where the matter cannot be [otherwise] determined [according to strict law]<sup><xref rid="fn400">20</xref></sup> and he is not permitted to allow the verdict to pass out of his hand [only] in part without [bringing the proceedings to] a [complete] close.<sup><xref rid="fn401">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. One against whom there is a monetary claim regarding aught of which he [the defendant] is [illegally] the possessor, is forbidden to seek means to evade [the claim] in order that the person concerned [the plaintiff] should consent to make a settlement with him and forgo the balance [of the claim].<sup><xref rid="fn402">22</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And if he violated</italic> [<italic>this law</italic>] <italic>and employed</italic> [<italic>evasive means</italic>], <italic>he does not comply with the requirements of Heaven until he restores to him</italic> [<italic>the plaintiff</italic>] <italic>what rightfully belongs to him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn403">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. Although the litigants consented [to submit their case] to arbitration before the Court of Law, they can retract so long as a formal agreement was not made with them by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn404">24</xref></sup> for [the law is that] arbitration requires a <italic>Kinyan</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn405">25</xref></sup> even if made before three.<sup><xref rid="fn406">26</xref></sup> However, if a formal agreement was made with them by means of a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> they cannot retract even if made before one.<sup><xref rid="fn407">27</xref></sup> And some say that [they cannot retract] only if made [at least] before two.<sup><xref rid="fn408">28</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: [<italic>And this has reference</italic>] <italic>not only to a formal agreement made by means of a Kinyan, but likewise, if he</italic> [<italic>the defendant</italic>] <italic>gave a note of indebtedness</italic> [<italic>thus</italic>] <italic>obligating himself</italic> [<italic>to carry out the settlement</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn409">29</xref></sup> <italic>or</italic> [<italic>by any</italic>] <italic>one of the other modes of transference of rights</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn410">30</xref></sup> <italic>Some say that when he assumes</italic> [<italic>liability by means of</italic>] <italic>a Kinyan relative to the arbitration, he must give him acquisition rights in the article so that it should not be a</italic> [<italic>mere</italic>] <italic>verbal agreement</italic><sup><xref rid="fn411">31</xref></sup> <italic>as will be explained infra &#x00A7; 203 beg</italic>.</p>
<p>8. A waiver requires no <italic>Kinyan. V., infra &#x00A7; 241</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn412">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. [If] two [litigants] accepted arbitrators by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> [in order to settle their case on the condition that should either of them fail to carry out the settlement he would have to pay] a fine of fifty [Z<italic>uzim</italic> or the like], and after [the decision of] the settlement [was given], one of the litigants stated, &#x2018;I will [rather] pay the fine but I will not fulfil [the conditions of] the arbitration,&#x2019; what he says is considered void.<sup><xref rid="fn413">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. If the litigant argues that the arbitrators who ordered him to act [in accordance with their decision] did not fix a time limit for him [to carry out their decision] and that he will act [accordingly] as soon as [the matter] will come to hand, what he says is considered void, but he must carry out [the decision] forthwith.<sup><xref rid="fn414">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. If A intimidated B, [viz.,] to deliver him [to a violent person]<sup><xref rid="fn415">35</xref></sup> should he not give him money [or the like] concerning which they [A and B] were in dispute and [in reality A] has no legal rights [in his claim] and [consequently] they made a settlement by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> and a [forced] cancellation [by B] of a notification<sup><xref rid="fn416">36</xref></sup> [he had previously made that the arbitration he was about to submit to was forced upon him against his will, the law is that] he [B] can [subsequently] retract therefrom.<sup><xref rid="fn417">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. [If] two people are in dispute concerning the building of immovable property and a settlement was made between them without a formal agreement by means of a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> [then] as soon as [the contending parties] accepted [to carry out the settlement] and one party built a little and the other party [also built] a little according to the decision of the arbitrators, they cannot retract.<sup><xref rid="fn418">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. [In the case of] a settlement of arbitration [submitted to] without [entering into] a formal agreement by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> and the defendant accepted their [the arbitrators&#x2019;] decision and prepared a document [to that effect], whether in [the form of] a statement of admission or in [the form of] a statement of liability,<sup><xref rid="fn419">39</xref></sup> [the law is that] he cannot retract therefrom.<sup><xref rid="fn420">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. One who denies [having received] a deposit and [the plaintiff] settled with him [the defendant] and waived his rights [against him] and subsequently discovered witnesses [who substantiate his claim, &#x2014; the law is that] he can retract.<sup><xref rid="fn421">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. And likewise regarding one who submitted to a settlement of arbitration because he had no evidence nor any document [available at the time in order to substantiate his claim] and subsequently discovered [it].<sup><xref rid="fn422">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. The law of a settlement of arbitration made in error will be explained [<italic>infra</italic>] at the end of &#x00A7; 25.</p>
<p>17. One who became bound to his fellow to take an oath, and they [the Court of Law] persuaded the claimant to waive [the oath] for his [the defendant&#x2019;s sake], and he [the claimant] stated, &#x2018;Let it be as you say,&#x2019; &#x2014; he [the claimant] can [subsequently] not retract [from his waiver].<sup><xref rid="fn423">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. If the arbitrators are many, &#x2014; some say that we do not follow the majority, but it is required that they all unanimously agree [in their decision].<sup><xref rid="fn424">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. [In the case of] a settlement of arbitration without [entering into] a formal agreement by means of a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> and they [the contending parties] delivered a pledge into the hand of the arbitrators, &#x2014; [the law is that] it has no legal consequences<sup><xref rid="fn425">45</xref></sup> unless they said, [This pledge] is no mere <italic>Asmakta</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn426">46</xref></sup> or [&#x2018;Let it be yours] from now.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn427">47</xref></sup> And if the pledge was a note of indebtedness, [mere delivery thereof] has no legal consequences.<sup><xref rid="fn428">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. The Judges are obliged to keep away [from adjudicating cases] in doing all that is in their power in order not to accept upon themselves to try suits in accordance with strict law.<sup><xref rid="fn429">49</xref></sup></p>

However, if you have already heard their pleas and know which way the judgment will incline, you cannot say to them: &#x201C;I am not bound to render a decision in your case,&#x201D; for it is written, <italic>Ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man</italic> (Deut. I, 17).&#x2019; V., <italic>supra</italic> n. 2. Regarding one of the Judges who wishes to withdraw from the case, v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 18, 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn384">4) Thus Yad, <italic>ibid.</italic> Because the entire community will protect him. This has reference even to a case where the Judge had not yet heard the pleas of the litigants, or even if he did hear the pleas but is in doubt which way the judgment will incline, &#x2014; yet, since he was appointed by the public he is bound to try the case; whereas one who is not an appointed Judge may withdraw under these conditions. Cf. the following sources which substantiate this ruling: Sifre to Deut. I, 16: <italic>&#x2018;And I charged your judges at that time saying</italic>: <italic>Hear the causes between your brethren</italic> etc. &#x2014; In former days you possessed your own authority; from now on you are slaves and subject to the community.&#x2019; Sifre to Deut. I, 17: &#x2018;Lest you say, I am afraid of So-and-so who might put my son to death, or might set my stack of grain on fire, or might cut down my young trees, &#x2014; the text reads, <italic>Ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man.</italic> And so too, does it state with regards to Jehoshaphat, <italic>and he said to the judges</italic>: <italic>Consider what ye do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord</italic> (II Chron. XIX, 6).&#x2019; The expression <italic>I am afraid of So-and-so</italic> etc., indicates that we deal here with a case where one of the litigants is of powerful influence, but since the Judges were appointed they could not withdraw froom the case. <italic>W.G.,</italic> however, disagrees with <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s ruling, viz., that in the case of an appointed Judge he may not withdraw even if he did not hear the case or even if he did hear the case, but is in doubt which way the judgment will incline, where the litigants are of unequal influence. For even in the case of an appointed Judge, <italic>W.G.</italic> maintains that it is only <italic>after</italic> he has heard the pleas and knows which way the judgment will incline that he cannot withdraw. And as to the above text in Sifre, &#x2018;In former days (i.e., prior to your appointment as Judges),&#x2019; &#x2014; it has reference even to a case where both litigants were of strong influence at which time you could withdraw before you heard the pleas, or where you had heard the pleas but were in doubt as to the verdict, &#x2014; for even in such a case there is still the possibility that the litigant who will be pronounced guilty, might harass the Judge, but where only one of the litigants is of strong influence, even an appointed Judge is permitted to withdraw before the pleas are heard etc. Appointed Judges are subject to the community and cannot withdraw save where both litigants are of powerful influence. Furthermore, the text in San. <italic>ibid.</italic> which also adduces the Biblical verse, <italic>Ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man,</italic> addressed to appointed Judges, found in Sifre <italic>ibid.,</italic> &#x2014; clearly states that we deal with a case where one litigant was of weak and the other of strong influence and only <italic>before</italic> the pleas are heard can the Judge wihtdraw. It follows therefrom that the exposition in Sifre <italic>ibid.,</italic> &#x2018;Lest you say etc.,&#x2019; also deals with similar circumstances. Hence, <italic>W.G.</italic> would not agree with <italic>Isserles&#x2019; Gloss</italic> anon. Cf. also <italic>Hag. Asheri</italic> to San. III who State the case of Mar &#x2018;Ukba who refused to act as Judge (although he was an appointed Judge. v. Shab. 55a) in a case where he knew that the litigants will not accept his decision (v. San. 29a), which is equivalent to a case where one litigant is of strong influence and the pleas had not been heard. In short, even an appointed Judge is not bound to try the case of strong and weak litigants prior to hearing the pleas or before he knows which way the judgment will incline.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn385">5) <italic>Hag. Asheri</italic> to San. I beg. and <italic>B.Yos.</italic> on the authority of <italic>Tosaf.</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> The reason being, that if the one pronounced guilty will harass the Judge, the other litigant will come to his aid (<italic>Tosaf. ibid</italic>.) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> This, of course means even if he is not an appointed Judge. V., however, <italic>supra</italic> n. 4, opinion of <italic>W.G.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn386">6) <italic>MaHaRIW</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> This means even if both litigants are of powerful influence. V., however, <italic>D.M.</italic> where the order of <italic>Isserles&#x2019; Gloss</italic> is a) not to interfere with violators etc., and then b) the ruling regarding two litigants of powerful influence. Cf. Kid. 71a the case of R. Phineas where we find that if powerful individuals might endanger one&#x2019;s life, one should refrain from admonishing them. <italic>A.H.</italic> writes that they may withdraw even at the conclusion of the trial even if they are permanent Judges only if there is danger. If a Judge sees that his other two colleagues (who are incompetent) are perverting justice, he may, when requested to give his legal opinion in the matter, say, &#x2018;I know not the law in this case,&#x2019; as a result of which other Judges will be co-opted to form a majority against the incompetent Judges (v. Mishna San. V, 5). This is permissible in the interests of peace (<italic>Tummim, Nethiboth</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn387">7) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXII, 4. Derived from San. 6b-7a: &#x2018;R. Joshua b. Kor&#x1E25;a states : Arbitration is a religious duty, for it is written, <italic>Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates</italic> (Zech. VIII, 16). Certainly where there is (the execution of) justice, there is no peace, and where there is peace, there is no (execution of) justice&#x0021; But what is that kind of justice that is accompanied by peace? &#x2014; You must admit: Arbitration (because the rigid application of the law does not necessarily set the contesting parties at peace). And so too, in the case of David it says, <italic>And David executed justice and righteousness</italic> (charity) <italic>towards all his people</italic> (II Sam. VIII, 15)&#x2026; But what is that kind of justice that is accompanied by righteousness? &#x2014; You must admit: Arbitration&#x2026; Rab stated: The adopted ruling (<italic>Halachah</italic>) agrees with R. Joshua b. Kor&#x1E25;a&#x2026; and it is a religious duty to ask the litigants whether they desire to resort to law or to submit to arbitration.&#x2019; Consequently, since it is a religious duty to arbitrate, the Judge should make this clear to the litigants in order that they consent to submit to arbitration. The meaning of <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s text, therefore, is: &#x2014; If you wish to resort to law I will act as your Judge; if not, then know ye that arbitration is preferable because it is a religious duty &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn388">8) Thus <italic>Tur.</italic> Derived from San. 32b: &#x2018;It has been taught: <italic>Justice, justice shalt thou follow</italic> (Deut. XVI, 20); the first (mention of <italic>justice</italic>) has reference to a verdict based on strict law; the second, to arbitration.&#x2019; V., <italic>Rashi</italic> a.l., s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D1;&#x05DC; &#x05E7;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;</span> who writes that the second mention of justice means that the Judge should <italic>justify</italic> the arbitration according to what he sees with his own eyes. <italic>R.A.Eger</italic> states that just as in the case of strict law, if the Judge perverts justice through error, he must reconsider the case and retract from his former decision, so too, in bringing about an arbitration. <italic>Shebuth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> reports the following case: <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> consented to submit their case to arbitration and entered into same by symbolic agreement (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>), <italic>A</italic> contests the legality of the decision on the following grounds: a) According to strict law, <italic>A</italic> was obliged to take a number of oaths in order to justify himself in the eyes of the Court. When the matter was submitted to arbitration, it was ruled that <italic>A</italic> be exempt from the imposition of an oath on condition that he pay instead a certain amount of money. <italic>A,</italic> however, claims that <italic>B</italic> too, was originally obliged to take a number of oaths, &#x2014; yet, in the latter case the arbitrator did not decide that he be exempt therefrom by paying money instead. In addition, <italic>A</italic> claims that certain oaths were overlooked entirely. b) The original agreement upon submitting the case to arbitration referred only to the elimination of oaths, but not to any other part of the case. However, according to the decision of the arbitrator, the settlement took into account the case as a whole. Hence, <italic>A</italic> contends that the entire decision is invalid. <italic>Responsum</italic>: Argument a) is not valid because undoubtedly the arbitrators have their reasons for acting thus only with respect to the oaths that <italic>A</italic> was required to take. Argument b), however, is a valid one and consequently, it must be reconsidered. We do not apply the principle that since one of the argument is valid then the whole case should be reconsidered. Should <italic>A,</italic> however, show that one argument depends upon the other, there is the possibility that the entire case must be reconsidered, but this must first be clearly established before invalidating the decision. Where the Judge is requested to arbitrate a case and render a decision that would be related to strict law (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E4;&#x05E9;&#x05E8;&#x05D4; &#x05E7;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05D4; &#x05DC;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>), the law is that not more than one third less than the amount the defendant would have to pay according to strict law, is regarded a valid settlement in such a case. E.g., if according to strict law he would have to pay 300 dollars, then 200 dollars would be regarded as a valid settlement &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn389">9) San. 6b: &#x2018;When do we regard a legal decision as rendered (so that arbitration is no longer permitted) ? &#x2014; Rab Judah on the authority of Rab states: (When they say) : So-and-so you are guilty; So-and-so you are not guilty.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn390">10) San. 6b-7a in agreement with the First Tanna <italic>contra</italic> R. Simeon b. Manasya. <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s ruling accords with the interpretation of <italic>Rashi,</italic> San. 6b, s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05D2;&#x05DE;&#x05E8; &#x05D4;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span> <italic>contra Tosaf.</italic> Cf. <italic>infra</italic> n. 11.

<ftnote id="fn391">11) It is forbidden to say to one who was pronounced not guilty, &#x2018;Make a settlement with the other party because I am afraid that I might have erred and the other Judges will reverse my decision&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>M.E. Ba&#x1E24;</italic> agrees with <italic>Tosaf. contra Rashi</italic> (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 10) that even before the pronouncement of the verdict, so long as the case has been thoroughly examined by the Judges, arbitration should not be proposed. <italic>ShaK</italic> opposes <italic>Ba&#x1E24;,</italic> but the latter is defended by <italic>Bir. Yos.,</italic> who shows that many other authorities agree with <italic>Tosaf.</italic> According to <italic>Tosaf.,</italic> even if the Judge did not state to the guilty party, &#x2018;Go and pay him whatever you owe him,&#x2019; it is still considered the &#x2018;conclusion of the trial&#x2019; (v. B.K. 69a, B.M. 17a s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05F2;&#x05D1;</span>). <italic>SeMaG,</italic> however, regards the trial as concluded only after this statement is made &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> According to <italic>Shilte Geborim,</italic> even after the conclusion of the trial, if the Judges inform the litigants concerning the nature of the settlement, and the latter agree to submit the case to arbitration, it is permissible, provided there was no coercion. Moreover, it is considered a meritorious act &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> Many other authorities, however, oppose <italic>Shilte Giborim</italic> &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn392">12) <italic>B.Yos.</italic> on the authority of <italic>Agudah</italic>. V., San. 6b where both the First Tanna and R. Simeon b.

Cf. also San. <italic>ibid.</italic>: &#x2018;Aaron loved peace, pursued peace and made peace between man and man, as it is written, <italic>The law of truth was in his mouth, unrighteousness was not found in his lips, he walked with Me in peace and uprightness and did turn many away from iniquity&#x2019;</italic> (Mal. II, 6) and cf. <italic>Tosaf.,</italic> a.l., s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D1;&#x05DC;</span> who explain that since Aaron was not a Judge, because all matters of a legal nature were brought before Moses, then for him arbitration was permissible.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn396">16) <italic>B.Yos.</italic> on the authority of <italic>R. Yeru&#x1E25;am</italic> and <italic>Asheri</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Cf. the following passages: B.K. 99b: &#x2018;Rabbah b. Bar &#x1E24;anah said on the authority of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan : An expert slaughterer who did not slaughter properly (as a result of which the animal became ritually unfit for consumption) is held responsible even if he was as skilled as the slaughterers of Sepphoris&#x2026; Did not Rabbah b. Bar &#x1E24;anah state that a similar case came before R. Jo&#x1E25;anan in the Synagogue of Maon and he said to the slaughterer, Go and bring proof that you are an expert to slaughter hens and I will exempt you? &#x2014; There is no difficulty. The latter law (has reference to a slaughterer who worked) gratuitously; the former (where the slaughterer does it) for hire&#x2026; A certain woman showed a <italic>Denar</italic> to R. &#x1E24;iyya and he informed her that it was good. Subsequently, she came to him again and said to him, I showed it later (to others) and they informed me that it was bad, and I could not pass it. He then said to Rab, Go and exchange it for a good one &#x2026; R. &#x1E24;iyya (although he was an expert and needed no further instruction in this matter, and consequently, would be exempt) acted beyond the requirements of the line of justice, as R. Joseph learnt: <italic>And shalt show them</italic> (v. Ex. XVIII, 20) refers to their livelihood; <italic>the way</italic> refers to acts of lovingkindness; <italic>they must walk</italic> refers to visiting the sick; <italic>wherein</italic> refers to burial <italic>and the work</italic> refers to law; <italic>which they</italic> <italic>must do</italic> refers to (acting) beyond the requirements of the line of justice.&#x2019; V., also B.M. 30b in the case of R. Ishmael b. R. Jose. Hence, we see that acting beyond the requirements of the law, although it is derived from a Biblical text, and in the eyes of the Judges it would be the proper thing to do, yet, it cannot be enforced by the Court of Law. Cf., however, B.M. 83a: &#x2018;Some carriers (negligently) broke a barrel of wine that belonged to Rabbah b. R. Huna (Thus <italic>Alfasi.</italic> Cur. edd. : &#x2018;b. Bar &#x1E24;anan&#x2019;). Thereupon he confiscated their cloaks; so they went and told Rab about it. Give them back their cloaks, said the latter. Is this the law, he asked. Yes, he answered, <italic>That thou mayest walk in the way of good men&#x2019;</italic> (Prov. II, 20). Hence, we may ask why this is not derived from the above-mentioned text? <italic>RI of Orleans</italic> in B.K. 100a, <italic>Tosaf</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05E4;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span> explains that acting &#x2018;beyond the requirements of the law&#x2019; has reference only to a) a case where others under the same circumstances would be liable to pay but not he, as in the case of R. &#x1E24;iyya and R. Ishmael b. R. Jose mentioned above, whereas in b) a case where there is no distinction between him and others (i.e., everyone would be exempt) as in the case of Rabbah b. Bar Huna, such action is merely a case of <italic>That thou mayest walk in the way of good men.</italic> Consequently, in a) acting beyond the requirements of the law is considered Biblical, whereas in b) it is based on post-Mosaic tradition. Hence, our present ruling refers to a). Cf. also B.M. 24b and <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05E4;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>. There are thus three degrees of acting beyond the requirements of the law: a) where the responsibility is such that it does not even come within the purview of acting beyond the requirements of the law. Consequently, one who out of equity acts thus, <italic>walks in the way of good men.</italic> E.g., the carriers who negligently broke a barrel of wine belonging to Rabbah b. R. Huna who suffered damages; b) where everyone would be exempt and should not even come under the category of acting beyond the requirements of the law, but since no damage was caused as in a), one should act beyond the requirements of the law. E.g., the case of the &#x2018;found asses&#x2019; in B.M. 24b (v. passage <italic>infra</italic> n. 17) ; c) where everyone else would be held responsible, in which case acting beyond the requirements of the law is based on a Pentateuchal text, although such action cannot be enforced. E.g., the case of R. &#x1E24;iyya. Our present ruling refers to c). V., also <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic> for other interpretations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn397">17) <italic>Mord.</italic> to B.M. II, &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Derived from B.M. 24b: &#x2018;R. Judah once went after Mar Samuel in a street of whole meal dealers and asked him: What is the law if one found a purse here? &#x2014; (Mar Samuel) answered: It belongs to the finder. What is the law if an Israelite came and produced an identification mark? &#x2014; (Mar Samuel) answered: He would be required to return it. Both (views contradict each other)&#x0021; &#x2014; (Mar Samuel) answered: One should act beyond the requirements of the law. So too, the father of Samuel found asses in a desert and (yet) he returned them after a year of twelve months: he (acted) beyond the requirements of the law.&#x2019; In this passage, the expression &#x2018;it belongs to the finder&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05E8;&#x05D9; &#x05D0;&#x05DC;&#x05D5; &#x05E9;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;</span>) indicates that <italic>legally</italic> it belongs to the finder. Consequently, the subsequent statement &#x2018;he would be required to return it&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05D1; &#x05DC;&#x05D4;&#x05D7;&#x05D6;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;</span>) refers to doing one&#x2019;s duty towards G-d. In addition the expression &#x2018;he returned them etc.,&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D4;&#x05D3;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D4;&#x05D5; &#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05D4;&#x05D5;</span>) indicates thhat he did this on his own. Moreover, he was only obliged to return their worth (v. <italic>Tosaf.,</italic> B.M. <italic>ibid.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05D1;&#x05EA;&#x05E8;</span>). Derived also from the case of the &#x2018;carriers&#x2019; (B.M. 83a. Cf. passage quoted <italic>supra</italic> n. 16), since it is not stated that they came before Rab for trial but rather &#x2018;they went and told Rab about it,&#x2019; i.e., to use his influence by means of words of persuasion. Thus also <italic>Asheri</italic> to B.M. II who considers this a case of acting beyond the requirements of the law and cites the Biblical text <italic>which they must do</italic> (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 16) and would be <italic>contra Tosaf.</italic> Hence, according to this opinion all cases of acting beyond the requirements of the law are similar and in all cases mentioned above we cannot compel anyone to act beyond the requirements of the law. The interpretation here follows <italic>W.G.</italic> and <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu.</italic> V., <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic> for other interpretations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn398">18) Thus <italic>Isserlein.</italic> Derived from B.K. 21a: &#x2018;A certain man built a mansion on the ruins belonging to orphans. R. Na&#x1E25;man confiscated the mansion from him&#x2026; originally Carmanians (MS.M <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05D3;&#x05DE;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;</span>; MS.R. and <italic>Rashi</italic> <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05D3;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;</span> &#x2018;old settlers&#x2019; or &#x2018;nomads&#x2019;) had been living on the abandoned property belonging to the orphans and had been paying a nominal rent (Hence the orphans suffered a loss however small it was). (When R. Na&#x1E25;man) said to him, Go and make a peaceful settlement with the orphans, he paid no attention. R. Na&#x1E25;man, therefore, confiscated the mansion from him.&#x2019; This shows that although legally the defendant was responsible in full, nevertheless, R. Na&#x1E25;man suggested at first a peaceful settlement. Likewise, the legal guardian of the orphans may make a settlement on behalf of the orphans which would ultimately be advantageous to their welfare. He should, however, make the settlement in accordance with a recognized Court of Law &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn399">19) Thus <italic>Isserlein.</italic> Derived from Kid. 42a (cf. parallel passages): &#x2018;R. Na&#x1E25;man stated on the authority of Samuel: Orphans who came to divide their father&#x2019;s estate, &#x2014; the Court of Law appoints a guardian for them, and they choose a suitable portion for each (orphan)&#x2026; R. Na&#x1E25;man on his own stated: When they reach their majority, they cannot protest, for if so, where is the power of the authority of the Court of Law?&#x2019; Since in legal matters we adopt the ruling of R. Na&#x1E25;man, it follows that the Court of Law or the guardian have the right to make a settlement for the benefit of the orphans and this remains in force even when they reach their majority. Moreover, even if the Court of Law had not issued a decree, the orphans cannot protest against the settlement when they reach their majority, because since this was done for their benefit it is tantamount to a legal transaction consumated on behalf of orphans which is binding even when they become of age &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn400">20) <italic>Asheri Resp.</italic> Derived from B.M. 42b: &#x2018;A certain administrator of orphans who bought an ox for them committed it to the care of a cowherd. But it had no molars or (front) teeth to eat with and it died. Said R. Rami b. &#x1E24;ama : How should Judges decide this case? Shall we say to the administrator, Go and pay; then he will retort, I committed it to the care of the cowherd (and he should have told me that it does not eat). Shall we say to the cowherd, Go and pay; then he will reply, I put it among the other oxen and I threw food before it; it was impossible to know that it was not eating anything. Now, let us see: The cowherd is a paid trustee of the orphans and should have looked into the matter (whether the ox eats or not) ? &#x2014; If there were a loss to the orphans, it would be so, but here we deal with a case where there is no loss to the orphans, for they found the owner of the ox (i.e., the seller) and the orphans received their money back from him (on grounds that it was a purchase made in error). Then who is the complainant? &#x2014; The owner of the ox pleads that he (the administrator) should have informed him. But what could he inform him? He certainly knows that it was a purchase made in error&#x0021; &#x2014; He (the owner of the ox) was a middleman who buys here and sells there (immediately). Therefore, he (the middle-man) swears that he knew not (of the animal&#x2019;s condition) and the cowherd pays the lower price of meat.&#x2019; This has reference to two-thirds of the usual price and was considered a sort of settlement because the cowherd advanced the plea, &#x2018;I put it among the other oxen etc.&#x2019; Thus <italic>Rashi. Tosaf.,</italic> however, state that the verdict was in accord with strict law, for if the cowherd were to inform the middleman about it, the latter would have had to slaugther it and sell it at a cheap price, not being able to wait until the market day.

<ftnote id="fn402">22) <italic>Terumath ha-Deshen</italic> s. 306. Cf. B.K. 40a-b: &#x2018;It has been stated: If a man borrowed an ox on the supposition that it is a <italic>Tam</italic> but was later discovered to have already been formally declared a <italic>Mu&#x2018;ad</italic> (then if it repeated to gore) the owner pays one half of the damages and the borrower pays (the other) half of the damages. But why should the borrower not contend against the owner, I borrowed an ox, I did not borrow a lion? &#x2014; Rab said: We deal here with a case where the borrower knew that the ox was a gorer (although he knew not that the ox was formally declared a <italic>Mu&#x2018;ad</italic>). Let him therefore plead: I borrowed an ox in the state of <italic>Tam,</italic> but I did not borrow an ox that was formally declared a <italic>Mu&#x2018;ad?</italic> &#x2014; Because the owner might retort: In any case, even if the ox had been a <italic>Tam,</italic> you would have to pay half-damages? Now, too, you must go and pay half-damages. Let him (the borrower) still contend against him: Were the ox in the state of <italic>Tam,</italic> damages would have to be paid out of its body (the indemnity would be collected from a sale of the animal and not from my best possessions. V., Ex. XXI, 35) ? &#x2014; Because the owner might retort: In any case, would you not have to compensate me (the full value of) the ox? Let him (the borrower), however, plead: Had the ox been a <italic>Tam,</italic> I would have admitted (the act of goring) and be exempt from making payment (because he who confesses an act with which a fine is connected, &#x2014; in this case the half-damages which may be considered as of a penal nature &#x2014; is exempt from the fine). And even according to the one who maintains (v. B.K. 15a) that half-damages is a civil liability (and by making a confession he would not be exempt), the borrower might still contend: Were the ox in a state of <italic>Tam,</italic> I would have caused it to flee to the meadow (and would have thus avoided payment out of its body which is the law in the case of <italic>Tam.</italic> V., Ex. <italic>ibid.</italic>) ? &#x2014; We deal here with a case where the Court of Law took steps first and seized the ox. If so, why should the owner pay half-damages? Let him contend: You were the cause of making my ox fall into the hands of one with whom I cannot go to law? &#x2014; Because the borrower might argue against him: Were I even to have returned it to you, would they not have taken it from you? But let the owner say to the borrower: Were you to have returned it to me, I would have caused it to flee to the meadow? &#x2014; Because the borrower might retort: In any case, would the damages not have been paid from the best of your possessions (since the ox was designated <italic>Mu&#x2018;ad</italic> while still in the possession of the owner) ? &#x2014; This would be a valid argument (by the borrower) where the owner possessed property, but what can be said where the owner possessed no property? &#x2014; Because the borrower can say to the owner: As well as I am obliged to pay you (i.e., to restore the ox), I am obliged to pay him (the plaintiff who is your creditor). This follows from (the dictum of) R. Nathan. For it was taught: R. Nathan stated: How do we know that if a man claims a <italic>Maneh</italic> (100 Z<italic>uzim</italic>) from another and the latter (claims a similar amount) from a third, that money is collected from the one (the last) and given to the other (the first) ? From the verse (Num. V, 7) : <italic>And give it unto him whom he hath trespassed</italic> (translating: And he [the last debtor] gives it unto him [the first] to whom he [the second] is indebted).&#x2019; The argument: <italic>&#x2018;I would have caused it to flee to the meadow&#x2019;</italic> is attacked by <italic>Tosaf.,</italic> a.l. s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05D5;&#x05D4; &#x05DE;&#x05E2;&#x05E8;&#x05E7;&#x05E0;&#x05D0; &#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05D4;</span> because this would certainly be regarded as an illegal act according to R. Akiba (<italic>contra</italic> R. Ishmael in B.K. 33a) who is of the opinion that both the plaintiff and the defendant become joint owners of the ox and consequently by causing the ox to escape to the meadow the defendant is regarded as a robber. Furthermore the Court of Law has a right to pronounce the ban against the defendant if he evades payment of damages. Therefore, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> explain that what is really meant by this argument is this: By causing the ox to flee to the meadow the plaintiff would have made a settlement with me for a small amount. Consequently, the borrower by not returning the ox to the owner has caused the latter damages by having to pay the difference between the settlemnt and the full amount of damages. This explanation of <italic>Tosaf.</italic> contradicts <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s present ruling according to which one is forbidden to employ evasive means in order to obtain the consent of the plaintiff to make a settlement and to forgo the difference. <italic>W.G.</italic> removes this contradiction by explaining that in B.K. the circumstances are entirely different because the borrower has a valid plea against the owner, viz., that the latter can have nothing against him, since he borrowed the ox on the assumption that it was <italic>Tam</italic> and it was discovered that it was declared <italic>Mu&#x2018;ad,</italic> consequently, he is not responsible for making any payment towards a liability which is in a different category. Hence, he may employ a vague and paltry reply, namely, <italic>&#x2018;I would have caused it to flee to the meadow.&#x2019;</italic> The same vague reply could be given by the owner, but it does not mean that it is permissible to actually do so. In short, it means that under the circumstances one may state that he would have acted thus, but not that it is really permissible to do this (v. <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu</italic>). In the present ruling however, we are told what the final law is in such a case. <italic>Tummim</italic> advances another interpretation. In B.K. we deal with a case where the owner may be trying to collect an old loan from the plaintiff, but he has no witnesses to prove this. Consequently, under the circumstances he may employ evasive means to recover his debt. <italic>Shebuth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> differentiates between <italic>Tosaf.</italic> and our present ruling as follows : In B.K. by causing the animal to escape to the meadow it would be considered merely an indirect act, which is permitted on the principle, &#x2018;sit and do nothing&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D1; &#x05D5;&#x05D0;&#x05DC; &#x05EA;&#x05E2;&#x05E9;&#x05D4; &#x05E2;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05E3;</span>), i.e., it is better not to act directly in doubtful cases; whereas in the present ruling the prohibition is against a direct act to force one into a settlement through evasive means. V., also Sheb. 31a that it is forbidden to use evasive means even in support of the truth. <italic>Tummim</italic> and <italic>Nethiboth</italic> write that the present ruling has reference only where the plaintiff has a just claim, but where the defendant has a valid counterclaim which he cannot ascertain before the Court of Law, he may employ evasive means, provided he does not appear as a wicked person in the eyes of the Judges.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn403">23) <italic>RaShBA</italic> in <italic>Resp.</italic> Cf. B.K. 55b-56a: According to R. Joshua one of the acts for which one is exempt before men but is liable before Heaven, is to hire false witnesses to offer testimony. Regarding this the Talmud says: &#x2018;In what case? Shall we say for his own benefit, then he has to pay back the money (he thus obtained illegitimately) and should be liable even by the judgment of men? &#x2014; It therefore means for the benefit of his friend.&#x2019; Hence, &#x2018;for his own benefit&#x2019; must mean that he employed evasive methods. Yet, it states &#x2018;he has to pay back the money&#x2019; whence it follows that the money is recovered by the judgment of men which contradicts <italic>Isserles</italic>&#x2019; ruling who states that &#x2018;he does not comply with the requirements of heaven&#x2019; which implies that he is exempt by the judgment of men. <italic>Isserles</italic> must therefore be in in accord with <italic>Tosaf</italic>. <italic>ibid.,</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05D0;</span> according to whom if we were to know that they are false witnesses he would have to pay, but since we are ignorant of this, the Talmud cannot very well state that he is exempt by the judgment of men. So too, <italic>Isserles,</italic> states that &#x2018;he does not comply with the requirements of Heaven&#x2019; because by employing evasive means he has thereby kept the entire matter hidden from people so that we are unaware whether he has anything in his possession illegally or not. Hence, the statement, &#x2018;he does not comply with the requirements of Heaven.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn404">24) Heb. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>. V. Glos. Thus <italic>Tur; Tosaf.; Mord</italic>. to San. I. This is <italic>contra Ra&#x2019;BIaH</italic> and <italic>RABaN</italic> who hold that if the litigants were silent after hearing the verdict of the arbitrators, <italic>Kinyan</italic> is not necessary &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> This applies even if at the outset the litigants agreed to resort to law <italic>contra N</italic> who rules that if at first they agreed to be tried in Court then subsequently if they consent to submit to arbitration, it holds good even without <italic>Kinyan</italic> &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> In order for the parties not to retract they must not only accept the arbitration by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> but must also expressly state that So-and-so should act as arbitrators. But if the arbitrators were not specified, they cannot arbitrate the case. However, if the contesting parties appeared before three Judges for trial and subsequently agreed to submit their case to arbitration before them, then <italic>Kinyan</italic> alone without expressly stating the names of the arbitrators is valid (<italic>RaN</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic> Accordingly, writes <italic>Bigde Yesha,</italic> if one states to another, &#x2018;I sell you this according to the appraisal of three persons&#x2019; (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 200, 7), or in the case of selling the <italic>&#x1E24;ame&#x1E93;</italic> to a non-Jew before the Festival of Passover (the contract containing the clause that the price of the <italic>&#x1E24;ame&#x1E93;</italic> will be fixed according to the appraisal of three competent persons), it would be obligatory to expressly mention the three persons. Yet, in the Talmud and the Codes we find no such requirement and even <italic>RaN</italic> might not be stating this as a law to be adopted. This matter, therefore, requires further study &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> The present ruling that they may retract if no formal agreement was made by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> means that even the plaintiff who consented to submit to a settlement with the defendant and to forgo some of his claims and we might have thought that this comes under the heading of &#x2018;a waiver requires no <italic>Kinyan&#x2019;</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05D4; &#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D4; &#x05E6;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DB;&#x05D4; &#x05E7;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>), &#x2014; yet, the following distinction should be borne in mind between &#x2018;a waiver&#x2019; where the individual of his own accord foregoes certain claims in which case it is binding even without a <italic>Kinyan</italic> (v. following par. and <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 241, 2) and &#x2018;a waiver&#x2019; which is the result of a settlement through arbitration made by the Judges where a <italic>Kinyan</italic> is required so that the plaintiff should subsequently not be able to plead against the Judges&#x2019; settlement. Hence, even if the Judges told the plaintiff that the defendant will have to pay him a certain amount of the claim and the plaintiff foregoes the balance, a <italic>Kinyan</italic> is required because the plaintiff foregoes the balance of his claim not of his own accord. Consequently, this implies (Thus <italic>D.M.</italic>) that if the plaintiff stated <italic>after hearing the settlement,</italic> &#x2018;I forego certain claims in accord with the verdict of the arbitrators&#x2019; or &#x2018;I forego an oath which should have been imposed upon the defendant,&#x2019; a <italic>Kinyan</italic> is not required &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn405">25) San. 6a. The arbitrators are relied upon that they effected a <italic>Kinyan</italic> in the event that the litigants deny this. A settlement reached by the litigants alone (i.e., effected by the plaintiff in favour of the defendant), requires no <italic>Kinyan,</italic> for then it comes under the heading &#x2018;a waiver requires no <italic>Kinyan&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; <italic>ShaK, MaHaRaM Lublin.</italic> Cf. however, <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 22, 3 from which we see that where the plaintiff himself suggests a settlement, if there was no <italic>Kinyan,</italic> he may retract <italic>contra</italic> ruling of <italic>MaHaRaM Lublin</italic> &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> However, if there was only one arbitrator who effected the settlement and he is contradicted, viz., that no <italic>Kinyan</italic> was made, he is not relied upon, on the principle that the evidence of one witness is not accepted in the case of counter-evidence &#x2014; <italic>Tummim.</italic> Judges who state that the litigants agreed to be tried before them and the litigants deny this, &#x2014; the law is that if there are no other witnesses to corroborate the statement of the Judges, the latter may not try this case, for although they are relied upon as witnesses, nevertheless, they cannot try this case on the principle that &#x2018;a witness may not act as a Judge&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05E2;&#x05D3; &#x05E0;&#x05E2;&#x05E9;&#x05D4; &#x05D3;&#x05F2;&#x05DF;</span>). However, arbitrators under the same circumstances are relied upon because a witness may act as an arbitrator &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> If they submitted the case to settlement by arbitration through &#x2018;striking hands&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05E2;&#x05EA; &#x05DB;&#x05E3;</span>), although it does not have the same effect as a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> nevertheless, the parties may be compelled to fulfil their promise because &#x2018;striking hands&#x2019; has the same status as an oath. Consequently, if the litigant dies, the heirs cannot be forced to submit to arbitration. However, in the case of <italic>Kinyan,</italic> the heirs may be forced to fulfil the <italic>Kinyan</italic> &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic> If they submit to arbitration before the representatives of the town (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05D9; &#x05D4;&#x05E2;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;</span>), <italic>Kinyan</italic> is not required and the parties cannot retract &#x2014; <italic>R.A.Eger</italic> (on the authority of <italic>Ba&#x1E24;.</italic> Actually found <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 22, 1, <italic>Gloss</italic>). Even if the litigants originally came to Court with the express purpose of submitting their case for arbitration, <italic>Kinyan</italic> is required &#x2014; <italic>Ba&#x1E24;, Tummim contra RaShaL.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn406">26) I.e., even if three Judges effected the settlement. Thus San. 6a, <italic>Rashi</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D4;&#x05DC;&#x05DB;&#x05EA;&#x05D0;</span>. Derived from the fact that R. Ashi (Gem. <italic>ibid</italic>.) who does not require <italic>Kinyan</italic> makes no distinction between two or three arbitrators. And since the adopted law is that arbitration requires a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> it follows, even if the settlement by arbitration was made by three.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn407">27) San. <italic>ibid</italic>. in accord with the view of the Sages that one is sufficient. Thus also <italic>Asheri</italic> and <italic>Tur.</italic> And even R. Simeon b. Gamaliel who holds that two are sufficient (<italic>ibid.</italic> 5b) is really of the opinion that one suffices (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6a). <italic>N.Yos.</italic> writes that <italic>Alfasi</italic> also holds that one is sufficient (cf. <italic>Hagahoth Derisha</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn408">28) Thus <italic>Caro in B.Yos.</italic> a.l. and in <italic>Kes. Mish.</italic> to Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXII, 6. The difficulty, however, is why does <italic>Maim.</italic> not rule in accord with the Sages who hold that one is sufficient (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 27) ? This difficulty may be removed if we realize that <italic>Maim.</italic> mentions two in order to indicate that in strict law their decision would not be binding (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 3, 1, n. 1), but in a settlement of arbitration even <italic>Maim.</italic> will hold that one is sufficient in accord with the Sages &#x2014; <italic>Be&#x2019;er ha-Golah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn409">29) <italic>B.Yos.</italic> on the authority of <italic>Resp.</italic> by <italic>RITBA</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Ket. 101b: &#x2018;It was taught: One who said to another, I owe you a <italic>Maneh,</italic> is liable according to R. Jo&#x1E25;anan; but Resh Lakish holds: He is exempt. Under what circumstances should this be understood? If (this has reference to a case) where one said to them (those present when he made this admission), You are my witnesses, what is the reason of Resh Lakish who rules that he is exempt? (for this would be <italic>contra</italic> San. 29b)? If, where he did not say to them, You are my witnesses, then what is the reason of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan who rules that he is liable? &#x2014; Actually, this (refers to a case) where he did not say to them, You are my witnesses, but here we deal with one who said to his fellow, I owe you a <italic>Maneh</italic> (and in the presence of witnesses) gave him a note of indebtedness (in which he admits the debt in his handwriting but it is not attested to by his signature nor by that of witnesses &#x2014; Thus <italic>Rashi</italic>). R. Jo&#x1E25;anan holds that he is liable because the items enumerated in a bond (delivered in the presence of witnesses) are as binding as if the one who delivered it said, You are my witnesses; but Resh Lakish holds, He is exempt because the items enumerated in a bond are not binding.&#x2019; Hence, we see that a bond is as binding as a <italic>Kinyan.</italic> Cf. also <italic>Asheri</italic> a.l. Although <italic>Caro</italic> (<italic>infra</italic> par. 13) already states this law, &#x2014; <italic>Isserles,</italic> however, refers to a note of indebtedness before the settlement of arbitration is made known. So long as the defendant states in the document, &#x2018;I hereby obligate myself to pay the amount which will be determined by the arbitrators,&#x2019; then even if there were no witnesses, it is binding even regarding aught that the defendant is not indebted to him. The document may also be written in the form of an admission. Cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 40 &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> The document must contain no conditions, for assuming liability on a condition has no legal effect in the case of a bond of indebtedness.

With reference to a courtyard in which there is no right of division. Then if it deals with one in which there is no right of division, even if both owners consent what does it matter? They can retract? &#x2014; R. Assi on the authority of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan stated: Each made a formal agreement with the other by means of a <italic>Kinyan.</italic> But even if they made such an agreement what does it matter since it is a mere verbal agreement (for this relates only to a verbal promise but not to any tangible object) ? &#x2014; They made an agreement by <italic>Kinyan</italic> to take different sides (consequently, something tangible is involved).&#x2019; Hence, the same applies to arbitration, i.e., the disputed article should be symbolically transferred from the defendant to the plaintiff by means of a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> the former stating, &#x2018;I hereby transfer the article to you,&#x2019; and the latter stating, &#x2018;I hereby forego in my claim whatever the arbitrators will decide.&#x2019; In the case of a monetary claim where the law is that &#x2018;money cannot be used for symbolical delivery&#x2019; (B.M. 45b a.e.), the defendant must assume the liability to pay as the arbitrators see fit &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Where the plaintiff states that he <italic>will</italic> forego a certain amount, it does not have its legal effect, for this is regarded as a <italic>Kinyan</italic> to the effect that &#x2018;I will give&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05D0;&#x05EA;&#x05DF;</span>) which has no binding force (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 203) &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic> V., also <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 245 beg. and &#x00A7; 73.

He answered him: He is under the obligation of a vow, but he cannot fulfil (his duty of <italic>&#x1E24;agigah</italic> thereby) ; he is a Nazirite, but he cannot shave (according to his stipulation to purchase the sacrifice with second tithe money, but only with unconsecrated funds, for once he stated, &#x2018; I take upon myself etc.,&#x2019; he remains under the obligation because his dedication to the Lord by word of mouth is equal to what delivery is in private transactions &#x2014; <italic>Rashi.</italic> Consequently, the subsequent condition has no legal effect to change the vow).&#x2019; Hence, in the present ruling too, since he made a formal agreement by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> to accept the settlement of arbitration, he cannot retract from his obligation to carry out the settlement by merely paying the fine. However, if he stated, &#x2018;Should I not fulfil the settlement of arbitration, I will pay the fine,&#x2019; the law is that if he desires he pays the fine and does not have to carry out the terms of the settlement &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic> Cf. also <italic>&#x1E24;elkath Me&#x1E25;okek</italic> and <italic>Beth Shemuel</italic> to E.H. &#x00A7; 50, 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn414">34) <italic>RaShBA.</italic> Cf. Ned. 3b: &#x2018;How is <italic>thou shalt not delay to pay it</italic> (Deut. XXIII, 22) with regards to <italic>Neziruth,</italic> applicable? For as soon as he says, Behold I am a <italic>Nazir,</italic> he becomes a <italic>Nazir</italic>; if he eats (grapes), he violates, <italic>neither shall he</italic> &#x2026; <italic>eat moist grapes or dried</italic> (Num. VI, 3) ? &#x2014; When he says, When I wish I will become a <italic>Nazir.</italic> But if he says, When I wish, the Biblical injunction, <italic>thou shalt not delay</italic> is not applicable? &#x2014; Said Raba, e.g., If he says, I must not leave the world before having been a <italic>Nazir,</italic> for he becomes a <italic>Nazir</italic> from that very moment. This is similar to one who says to his wife, Behold here is your bill of divorce (to become effective) one hour prior to my death in which case she is straightway forbidden to eat <italic>Terumah.</italic> Hence, we say that he may die any moment. Consequently, here too, (regarding a <italic>Nazir</italic>) he becomes a <italic>Nazir</italic> at once, because we say, Perhaps he will die now.&#x2019; Thus we see that when one undertakes to fufil something without mentioning any specified time, it takes effect immediately. Consequently, the same principle operates in the present ruling. Cf. also Sifra to Lev. XV, 25. Once the arbitrators state their decision before the litigants, they must not make any changes, for their commission is then considered completed. However, as long as they have not stated their decision before them, although they had stated it before the witnesses or others, they may still make changes according to their discretion &#x2014; <italic>Birkath Ya&#x2018;akob.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn417">37) <italic>Asheri</italic> in <italic>Resp.</italic> For only in the case of a &#x2018;sale&#x2019; do we rule, &#x2018;If they tortured (lit. suspended) him, and he agreed to sell, the sale is valid&#x2019; <span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05D4; &#x05D5;&#x05D6;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05D6;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05D4; &#x05D6;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;</span> (B.B. 48a), for whenever one agrees to sell something it is done under duress (being in need of money) and consequently, his consent, although given under pressure is valid (<italic>ibid.</italic> 47b). But this has reference only to a sale where he receives money for his article. However, in the case of a gift it is not valid because the donor receives nothing in return, and consequently, does not agree to give the recipient ownership rights in the gift (B.B. 47b, <italic>RaShBaM,</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05D4; &#x05D5;&#x05D6;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>). Further, in the case of a sale if he made a declaration of protest (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05E2;&#x05D0;</span>) before witnesses that the sale was being forced upon him against his will, the sale is not valid, whereas in the case of a gift, it is not valid even if the donor did not make a declaration of protest as long as the witnesses know that he was under pressure, or where he issued his protest even if they knew not of his duress. Again, in the case of a gift his cancellation of the declaration of protest unlike the case of a sale, is not valid (save where we knew not of his duress and he cancelled his previous declaration of protest &#x2014; B.B. 48a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;</span>; <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 242, 2). Hence, a settlement of arbitration <italic>where the plaintiff has no legal grounds</italic> is on the same footing as a gift. Therefore, if we know that the defendant is under pressure, his cancellation of the previous notification or declaration of protest has no legal effect. V., <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu.</italic> The present ruling is also applicable where the defendant was forced to take an oath, provided the oath was of such a nature that one could cancel or annul it mentally (although the law is that &#x2018;a mental stipulation is not valid&#x2019; <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD; &#x05E9;&#x05D1;&#x05DC;&#x05D1; &#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05DD; &#x05D3;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span> [Kid 49b], in the case of pressure it is effective) and that his verbal statement of the oath should not be contradictory to his mental stipulation (v. Y.D. &#x00A7; 232, 14). The present ruling with regards to the &#x2018;cancellation of a notification&#x2019; means that it subsequently became known to us that the cancellation was also made under pressure.

V., text cited <italic>supra</italic> n. 31), the law is that as soon as <italic>one</italic> of the parties takes possession of his share, the division becomes effective and neither may retract (<italic>contra</italic> Yad, <italic>Shekenim</italic> II, 10 cited by <italic>Caro infra</italic> &#x00A7; 157, 2), in the present ruling even <italic>Tur</italic> will agree that <italic>both</italic> contending parties must build (or employ any other mode of acquisition depending on the case in question.

It is for this reason that <italic>Asheri</italic> (source of <italic>Tur</italic>&#x2019;s ruling) writes (to B.B. 3a) that even if one of the partners took possession of his share in the absence of his fellow-partner and even if the latter did not say to him, &#x2018;Go take possession and acquire ownership&#x2019; (v.

Kid. I, 9 cited by <italic>Asheri</italic> because even if <italic>one</italic> takes possession it is done for the benefit of both parties (thus TaZ); whereas in the present ruling the parties are in dispute as to who should build one part and who the other part.

This is <italic>contra &#x2018;Ir Shushan</italic> who maintains that even in the present case it suffices even if only one party builds &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Hence, according to the present ruling, even if there was no formal agreement by means of a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> nevertheless, since both parties carry out the terms of the settlement, it is regarded as though a settlement was entered into &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>

Hence, it is advisable to stipulate prior to the settlement of arbitration that they will follow the majority since it is almost impossible for all the arbitrators to reach a unanimous decision &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> Arbitrators may also act as witnesses which is not so in the case of strict law (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 7, 5) &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>

For otherwise, three laymen or one authoritative Judge suffice &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Cf. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 3, 1, notes. Furthermore, this ruling has reference only to a case where the litigants insist on resorting to law, but where they submit their case to arbitration, and each party chooses one Judge, the selected Judges cannot nominate a third Judge without the consent of the litigants, the reason being that arbitration does not require three &#x2014; <italic>ShaK, N.B.</italic> cited in <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> Nowadays it is the accepted custom that even in a case of strict law the two litigants may choose the third Judge &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn431">2) Thus Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> VII, 1 according to reading of <italic>SeMaG</italic> (v. also <italic>Kesef Mishneh ibid.; B.Yos.</italic> a.l.). Derived from San. 23a in accord with the Sages. If the two chosen Judges are related to each other, the defendant has the advantage to compel the plaintiff to select another Judge (<italic>Isserles</italic> in <italic>Resp</italic>.) &#x2014; <italic>R.A.Eger.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn432">3) Thus <italic>Tur.</italic> Derived from San. <italic>ibid</italic>.: &#x2018;No one disagrees that the (third) Judge must have the consent of his colleagues; they (R. Meir and the Sages) merely differ whether the consent of the litigants is (also) required. R. Meir holds that the consent of the litigants is also necessary; whereas the Sages maintain: only that of the Judges is necessary but not that of the litigants.&#x2019; The law follows the opinion of the Sages. Should the defendant agree that the selection of the third Judge should also be made with the consent of the litigants, it is permissible (v. <italic>Bertinoro</italic> San. <italic>ibid.,</italic> and cf. comments of <italic>Tosaf. Yom Tob</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> And even according to <italic>Lebush</italic> that such a procedure will delay the execution of justice (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05D9; &#x05D4;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>) for the defendant may always disagree with the plaintiff&#x2019;s choice, &#x2014; yet, if the plaintiff agrees that the third Judge be chosen with the consent of the contending parties, <italic>Lebush</italic> will also agree that it is permissible &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn433">4) Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> in accord with San. <italic>ibid.</italic> that the meaning of the words, &#x2018;Each party chooses <italic>one</italic>&#x2019; refers not to a Court of Law but to <italic>one Judge.</italic> Hence, each party chooses one Judge and they jointly nominate a third.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn434">5) San. <italic>ibid</italic>.: &#x2018;Since each litigant chooses a Judge and jointly they nominate a third, a true judgment will be rendered.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn435">6) Whether superior or inferior to the other in learning &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> The Judge must, however, be versed in law or must be a recognized <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh.</italic> Otherwise, he may be rejected (<italic>B.Yos.</italic> citing <italic>R. Yeru&#x1E25;am</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> This ruling is derived from San. <italic>ibid</italic>.: &#x2018;R. Papa stated: It has reference even to <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> (i.e., the debtor or defendant may reject the Judge chosen by the creditor or plaintiff even if he is a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic>), e.g., the Courts of R. Huna and R. &#x1E24;isda (their Courts were close to each other), for he (the defendant) can say: Am I troubling you?&#x2019; This applies where one litigant persuaded the <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> to act in the capacity of an &#x2018;<italic>arbiter</italic>&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05E8;</span>), but if he said to his fellow-litigant, &#x2018;Come, let us have our case tried before the city Sage, the latter is not designated an &#x2018;<italic>arbiter</italic>&#x2019; and is the Judge for both parties &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Although the law is that an individual <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> may judge alone against the will of the defendant, it applies only where the latter refuses to appear for trial, but where he states, &#x2018;I wish to select another Judge too, he is obeyed &#x2014; <italic>Ba&#x1E24;, ShaK contra M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn436">7) Thus <italic>Rashi</italic> San. <italic>ibid.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05E6;&#x05D0;</span> and <italic>Asheri.</italic> Cf. also Y. San. III, 1(21a): &#x2018;Because he has chosen him as arbiter, he will advocate his (client&#x2019;s) claim.&#x2019; Since they both feel that their rights are equally secure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn437">8) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> All the laws of Judges apply equally in the case of arbiters &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn438">9) <italic>Asheri</italic> to San. <italic>ibid.</italic> For just as in the case of a Court of three or one authoritative Judge, the law is that they may try cases even against the will of the defendant where he refuses to appear before the Court (cf. San. 5a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05DF;</span>), so too, the leaders or the representatives of the town enjoy the same status (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 2 and notes).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn439">10) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> San. <italic>ibid</italic>.: &#x2018;The pureminded of Jerusalem used to act thus &#x2026; they would not sit in judgment unless they knew who was to sit with them.&#x2019; But if the plaintiff deliberately chooses an unworthy Judge, the defendant may say to him, &#x2018;I will not answer your pleas until you choose a worthy Judge&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn440">11) <italic>MaHaRIW</italic> s. 11 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Since the parties accepted them, it is sufficient. And where the contesting parties agreed to be tried by them, the law is that even an unauthoritative Judge may try the case (v. San. 5a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05DF;</span>). Cf. also San. 6a. Hence, it follows that even in the first instance where the Judge was accepted, his judgment is valid, and much more so where two Judges were accepted, each by one of the parties. Consequently, we assume that the intention of the litigants is that if the two selected Judges reach a harmonious decision, there is no need for them to choose a third Judge. <italic>Ta</italic>Z (followed by <italic>A.H</italic>.) disagrees with this ruling.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn441">12) <italic>N.</italic> to Deut. I, 12 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Cf. Y. San. III, 3(21a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn442">13) Thus <italic>Tur.</italic> Derived from Mishna B.M. 20a: &#x2018;If one found documents of <italic>Berurin</italic>,&#x2019; which is explained in Gemara <italic>ibid</italic>.: &#x2018;What is meant by documents of <italic>Berurin?</italic> &#x2014; Here (in Babylon) they explain it as records of pleas (minutes of Court proceedings). R. Jeremiah stated: (Documents referring to the choice of arbiters, stating): This party selected one (Judge) and that party selected another (Judge).&#x2019; V., also B.B. 168a. The present ruling follows the interpretation given by R. Jeremiah. Cf. also Y.M.K. III, 3(82a) bot. The choice of the Judges was recorded by the contesting parties so that they should not be able to retract. Thus <italic>Rashi, Asheri</italic> and other <italic>Codifiers.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn443">14) I.e., since they cannot retract after the document is prepared, therefore &#x2026; For the principle is that &#x2018;one may not act to another&#x2019;s disadvantage in his absence&#x2019; <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05D7;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05DC;&#x05D0;&#x05D3;&#x05DD; &#x05E9;&#x05DC;&#x05D0; &#x05D1;&#x05E4;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;</span>&#x00B7; Hence, their approval is necessary &#x2014; <italic>Perisha, M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn444">15) Mishna B.B. 167b: &#x2018;Documents referring to the choice of arbiters &#x2026; are not written execept with the consent of both parties and both pay the fee (for the preparation of the documents).&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn445">16) <italic>N.Yos.</italic> to B.M. I &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> San. 24b: &#x2018;After one enters into an agreement by means of a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> nothing (can be done to cancel the agreement).&#x2019; For it is then regarded as the conclusion of the trial. Cf. Y. San. III, 3(21a): &#x2018;Once the trial is concluded no one may retract.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn446">17) <italic>N.Yos.</italic> on the authority of Y. &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Y. San. III, 4(21a): &#x2018;If one accepted to be tried before two, he may retract; before three, he may not retract.&#x2019; This is explained by <italic>N.Yos.</italic> and <italic>Asheri</italic> to B.M. <italic>ibid.</italic> to mean that the parties had already stated their pleas before the Judges. Hence, if before three, they cannot retract.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn447">18) V. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 80, 2, <italic>Gloss.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn448">19) Once the pleas have been stated the trial is considered as concluded and the litigants have no right to request that the Judges be increased so that a new trial take place. Thus according to Y. <italic>ibid.</italic> V., <italic>W.G.</italic> and <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu</italic> a.l. However, if all the Judges agree to increase the number of the Judges, they may do so even without the approval of the contesting parties (<italic>Beth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh. Tummim</italic> writes that the fact that the litigants have no right to increase the number of the Judges has reference only to a case of arbiters (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>), but where they are tried by the appointed Court of Law in the town, they may demand that the number of Judges be increased, even after the litigants have presented their pleas before the Judges. Cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn449">20) I.e., to his fellow-litigant. Not only must we not compel one litigant to submit his arguments in writing to his fellow-litigant because he may state: &#x2018;You (i.e., the fellow-litigant) appear to me like a lurking lion&#x2019; (B.B. 168a), i.e., &#x2018;I have no confidence in you,&#x2019; for you merely wish to acquaint yourself with my arguments in order to prepare or have someone else prepare counter-arguments against me; but even the Court of Law cannot force any litigant to submit to them the pleas in writing even if he had already stated his pleas before them, because once the arguments are recorded, the litigant can no longer alter them (<italic>N.Yos. to Mishna</italic> B.B. 167b. Cf. <italic>supra</italic> n. 15) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn450">21) I.e., where the litigants have not yet stated their arguments orally. Thus <italic>RIBaSh</italic> cited by <italic>B.Yos.</italic> For then one litigant will have to go to the trouble and expense of obtaining a copy of the other litigant&#x2019;s arguments in order to present his counter-arguments in writing. Furthermore, the law is that the Judges must hear the arguments orally, for then it is more feasible for them to detect any false statements in the pleas which would not be the case were the litigants permitted to present their cases in prepared written documents, phrased very carefully (and in some instances written by another party) in order to influence the Court on their behalf &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn451">22) I.e., the Judges instruct the scribes to record the arguments after they were heard orally &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn452">23) So as not to be able to retract subsequently. V., <italic>supra</italic> nn. 14 and 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn453">24) Since they agree and have no apprehension lest one will record false statements &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn454">25) Even if they advance a plausible explanation (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05DE;&#x05EA;&#x05DC;&#x05D0;</span>) for retracting the arguments (<italic>N.Yos</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Cf. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 7, n. 32 end.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn455">26) Mishna San. III, 1(23a): &#x2018;Each party may disqualify the Judge chosen by the other. So R. Meir. But the Sages say: When does this apply? Only if they can bring proof that they are kinsmen or (otherwise) ineligible; but if they are eligible or recognized by the Court of Law as <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in,</italic> they cannot be disqualified. Each may disqualify the other&#x2019;s witnesses. So R. Meir. But the Sages say: When does this apply? Only if they can bring proof that they are kinsmen or (otherwise) ineligible; but if they are eligible they cannot be disqualified.&#x2019; Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic> 23b: &#x2018;R. Eleazar stated: This (i.e., the part of the Mishna which deals with disqualifying the witnesses) applies where he (the litigant) together with another person came to disqualify them (Alone he would not have the authority to declare the witnesses ineligible). But does he have the authority to do this, the fact being that he is an interested party (consequently only one witness is left and the law is that one witness does not have the authority to disqualify the testimony of two)? &#x2014; R. A&#x1E25;a b. R. Ika said: (Yes;) e.g., where the qualification of one of the witnesses was contested. Of what nature was that alleged disqualification? Shall we say a disqualification based on a charge of robbery? But does he have the authority to do this, the fact being that he is an interested party? Hence, the disqualification must be based on alleged family blemish (descent from slaves whose testimony is inadmissible or in the case of a Judge who is descended from converts. Cf. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 7 beg.). R. Meir maintains that they (the litigant and the one who substantiates his testimony) testify against the man&#x2019;s <italic>family</italic> blemish, while <italic>he</italic> (his fellow-litigant) automatically becomes disqualified; and the Sages contend that after all said and done he is still an interested party.&#x2019; The law follows the opinion of the Sages. Although the above discussion refers only to that part of the Mishna that deals with the disqualification of witnesses, the same principle applies to Judges adopted in the present ruling.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn456">27) <italic>Hag. Maim.</italic> to Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXIV, 3 on the authority of <italic>R. Meir of Rothenberg.</italic> V., Y.San. I, 2(18c); Y. R.H. III, 1(58d): &#x2018;R. Huna had something to testify for a certain person. When the plaintiff went and brought his action before (R. Huna), (the defendant) denied (the claim) of his (fellow-litigant). R. Samuel b. R. Isaac said (to the defendant), Is it because you are aware that R. Huna is a distinguished personage (and it is not dignified for him to go and testify for the plaintiff before another judicial court) that you deny the (plaintiff&#x2019;s claim)? What will you do if he goes and testifies against you before another Court of Law? Said R. Huna to (R. Samuel b. Isaac), May this be done (i.e., to withdraw from the case and then go and testify before another court)? &#x2014; Yes, he replied. R. Huna then dismissed himself from that case (because a witness cannot act as a Judge. V., <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 7) and went and testified before another Court of Law.&#x2019; Cf. <italic>Mareh ha-Panim</italic> a.l. and cf. also <italic>Hag Asheri</italic> to Git. I beg., where the above text of Y. is cited. However, if the plaintiff chose a Judge who has something to testify for the defendant, the latter does not have to respond to the plaintiff&#x2019;s claim until he chooses another Judge &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> If one of the litigants who is a powerful person refuses to be tried by the Court of Law that was chosen and other authoritative Judges refuse to deal with the case, the law is that he is compelled to be tried by the first Court that was chosen (<italic>MaHaRIK</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn457">28) <italic>N.Yos.</italic> Derived from San. 31b: &#x2018;If it is necessary to ask advice from &#x2026; (the Supreme Court in Jerusalem), the matter is recorded and sent on to them.&#x2019; The reply is forwarded to the Judges and not to the litigants.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn458">29) Sheb. 30a: &#x2018;When it states: <italic>between whom the controversy is</italic> (Deut. XIX, 17 &#x2014; <italic>And the two men between whom the controversy is shall stand before the Lord, before the priests and the Judges</italic>), the litigants are already referred to.&#x2019; Cf. also <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 7, n. 14. V., however, <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 18, 6 where it is stated: The Court of Law may render decisions in civil cases in the absence of the litigant&#x2019; which contradicts the present ruling. <italic>ShaK</italic> (cf. also <italic>M.E. infra</italic>), therefore, removes this apparent difficulty by explaining that <italic>infra</italic> we deal with cases where the litigants had already presented their arguments before the Court where the decision may be given even in the absence of the litigants; whereas in the present ruling we deal where the litigants had not yet stated their pleas or arguments before the Judges.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn459">30) <italic>Hag. Asheri</italic> to San. III on the authority of <italic>Or Zarua&#x2018;</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Derived from the ruling stated <italic>supra</italic> par. 1, viz., that the two arbiters chosen by the litigants nominate the third Judge without the approval of the contesting parties &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn460">31) This provision must be set down in writing at the outset. Otherwise the law is that in a settlement of arbitration we do not follow the majority (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 12, 18, n. 44). However, in a case where they resort to law we follow the majority unless one of the Judges was undecided (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 18, 1) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> According to <italic>R.A.Eger</italic> since <italic>resorting to law or submitting to arbitration</italic> were mentioned together, then even if this provision was not set down in writing, we follow the majority even in a settlement of arbitration.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn461">32) Mishna San. 29a: &#x2018;If two (Judges) said, He is not guilty, and one said, He is guilty, he is not guilty; if two said, He is guilty, and one said, He is not guilty, he is guilty; if one said, He is guilty and one said, He is not guilty, or two declared him not guilty or two declared him guilty, while one said, I do not know, the number of Judges is increased.&#x2019; Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic> 30a: &#x2018;How is (the verdict phrased (in a case where the Judges disagree)? &#x2014; R. Jo&#x1E25;anan said: (The defendant) is not guilty. Resh Lakish said: So-and-so (of the Judges) declare him not guilty; So-and-so declare him guilty. R. Eleazar said: The defendant has been acquitted by their (the Court&#x2019;s) verdict. Wherein do they differ? &#x2026; They differ as to whether they must pay his share (in case of an erroneous decision. Cf. <italic>ibid.</italic> 6a, 33a) in addition to their own. According to the view (that the verdict is worded): He is not guilty, they are held responsible for payment (in full because their opinion was adopted); but according to the opinion (that the wording is): So-and-so (of the Judges) declare him not guilty and So-and-so declare him guilty, they are not obliged to pay (the share of the dissenting Judge. Their opinions are specified separately to indicate that the final verdict was given only by two &#x2014; <italic>Rashi</italic>). But even according to the view (that the verdict should be worded): He (the defendant) is not guilty, why should they be held responsible for payment (in full)? Let them say to him (the third Judge): <italic>Had you not sat in judgment with us, the verdict would not have been passed at all&#x0021;&#x2019;</italic> Hence, we see that if the dissenting Judge would have dismissed himself from sitting in judgment after noticing that the other Judges have erred, or had he stated, &#x2018;I do not know,&#x2019; then the entire trial would have no result at all. Therefore, by stating his view he was the cause of the other Judges reaching a decision in the case and should be held responsible for his share of compensation. The same principle operates even where the number of the Judges would be more than three.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn462">33) And is then regarded as non-existent, i.e., as if he withdrew from the case. V., San. 17a, 5b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn463">34) V. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 18, 1 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> For it might have been possible that were the Judge who stated, &#x2018;I do not know how to decide&#x2019; to advance a dissenting opinion, the others would have concurred with him. Should however, the one who withdrew from the case appear subsequently and state that he agrees with the view of the other Judges, the decision is considered valid &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> The present ruling is found in <italic>RaShBA, Resp.</italic> cited by <italic>B.Yos.</italic> a.l.</ftnote>

The present ruling is derived from San. 31b: &#x2018;When R. Dimi arrived (from the Land of Israel), he stated on the authority of R.

In short, it is not firmly established that one of them is a defendant (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05EA;&#x05D1;&#x05E2;</span>), but both are claimants (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D6;&#x05D4; &#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05DF; &#x05D5;&#x05D6;&#x05D4; &#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05DF;</span>), in which case we do not yield to the demands made by the one who says, &#x2018;Let us be tried by the Supreme Court.&#x2019; However, where the litigants fall into the category of a claimant (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05E2;</span>) and a defendant (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05EA;&#x05D1;&#x05E2;</span>), then we submit to the demand of the claimant &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z. Cf. <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn478">15) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> VI, 7. For in these cases too, the defendant is a servant of the claimant until he pays for the damages or establishes that he was not the cause of the damages. Cf. San. 31b regarding the message that was sent to Mar &#x2018;Ukba in Babylon by the Court of Israel with respect to &#x2018;Ukban, the Babylonian, who complained that his brother Jeremiah wronged him, and instructions were given to &#x2018;Ukban to try him in Babylon, and should the latter not accept the verdict, to see to it that he appears before the Court in Tiberias. Thus we see that not only in the case of a creditor and debtor may we compel the defendant to be tried in the Land of Israel before the Supreme Court, but also in all other cases of injury. Thus also Ket. 16b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>; <italic>Asheri</italic> to San. <italic>ibid.</italic> Cf.

<ftnote id="fn479">16) That the defendant may be compelled to attend the Supreme Court of Law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn480">17) So that not everyone should make a claim against his fellow and demand to be tried before the Supreme Court of Law in order that the defendant who will have to lose time and money by going there be forced to make a settlement with the claimant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn481">18) Since the principle <italic>the borrower is servant to the lender</italic> does not apply because we have no proof that he is a <italic>borrower.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn482">19) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> VI, 9. Derived from San. 32b: &#x2018;Our Rabbis taught: <italic>Justice, justice shalt thou follow</italic> (Deut. XVI, 20) means, Follow a renowned Court of Law, e.g., (follow) R. Eliezer (b. Hyrkanus) to Lydda, R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai to Beror Hail.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn483">20) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G. Isserles</italic> informs us here that even according to <italic>Maim.</italic> who makes no distinction between the Supreme Court of Law and the place of Assembly (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 3) refers in his ruling to localities <italic>in the same province,</italic> because nowadays we have no power to compel one to leave one province and be tried in another province as was the case when the Supreme Court was in existence. This follows from the fact that <italic>Maim.</italic> does not employ the term <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span> (provinces) but rather <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E7;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span> (localities). Hence, <italic>Isserles</italic> adduces a dissenting opinion (<italic>Asheri, Tur</italic>) that even nowadays a renowned Court of Law (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05EA; &#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05D7;&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;</span>) has the same authority as the ancient Supreme Court. Consequently, one may be compelled to be tried in another <italic>province</italic> &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn484">21) This is in accord with <italic>Maim.</italic> interpretation (v. <italic>Caro supra</italic>) that just as in the times of the Supreme Court of Law if the claimant had witnesses or other substantial evidence in which case he could compel the defendant to go with him to the Supreme Court of Law, so too, nowadays any authoritative Court of Law falls into the same category. Hence, the claimant may compel the defendant to be tried there &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>

It seems therefore, that in the present ruling we deal with a case of two guests (transient lodgers) from two different cities. Hence, if we do not compel them to be tried here, it will be difficult for the plaintiff to find the defendant later; while <italic>N</italic> deals with two litigants who are both from the same city where this problem does not arise &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn495">32) <italic>MaHaRIK</italic> Rt. 1 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Derived from B.K. 46b: &#x2018;R. Samuel b. Na&#x1E25;mani said: Whence do we derive that on him (the claimant) that would exact aught from his fellow lies the burden of proof (<italic>onus probandi</italic>)? For it is said: <italic>If any man have any matter to do, let him come unto them</italic> (Ex. XXIV, 14), (which implies): Let him bring proof before them. But R. Ashi objected: Do we require a Scriptural verse to inform us this? Is this not founded on reason that he who feels sick goes to the physician?&#x2019; Likewise, in the present ruling the claimant who &#x2018;has pains&#x2019; must go to the city of the defendant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn496">33) By means of a <italic>saisie-arret.</italic> This, of course, means that the claimant must be able to show that he has a right to seize the money, e.g., where he will not be able to take the defendant to law later or where there are other logical reasons for going through with the seizure (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 73, 10). If after the money was seized the defendant demands his money, he must then go to law with the claimant in the local Court where the money was seized &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn497">34) And the expense for sending the message to the defendant must be defrayed by the claimant &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn498">35) <italic>Terumath ha-Deshen</italic> s. 305 and in <italic>Decisions</italic> of same s. 62 &#x2014; <italic>G. MaHaRIK</italic> writes that the custom has spread to seize the defendant&#x2019;s money wherever it may be. Accordingly, it seems that the claimant may sue the defendant wherever he seized the money. Cf., however, <italic>Isserles infra</italic> &#x00A7; 73, 10 whence this inference does not follow &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Although the defendant now becomes a claimant, nevertheless, he cannot appoint a mandatory (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05E9;&#x05D4;</span>) to act on his behalf &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn500">37) Y.D. &#x00A7; 240, 8 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> This applies even if the father has a claim against another person in the same locality where his son lives.

<ftnote id="fn501">38) I.e., all fear him and are partial towards him. Cf. <italic>supra</italic> n. 15 and &#x00A7; 13, n. 27 end. This applies equally whether he is the plaintiff or the defendant and despite the fact that the members of the local Court are very learned, &#x2014; for we apprehend that because of his influential position they will not render an impartial verdict. However, if he is not a powerful person but is only highly respected in his city on account of his wealth or wisdom and his fellow-litigant demands to be tried in another city, then it depends upon the discretion of the Judges, viz., that if they really feel that they might be partial towards him, he may be compelled to attend Court in another city; if not, they try him here &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh., A.H.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn503">40) Cf. Sheb. 31a: &#x2018;Whence do we know that if two come to Court, one (of the litigants) clad in rags and the other in a fine robe worth a hundred <italic>Manehs,</italic> they (the Judges) should say to him (the one who is well dressed), Either dress like him, or dress him like you (so that the Judges should not be biassed in your favour and the poorly clad person become not disheartened)? &#x2014; Because it is said: <italic>From a false matter keep far</italic> (Ex. XXIII, 7). When they (the litigants) would come before Raba b. R. Huna, he used to say to them, Take off your fine shoes and come down for judgment.&#x2019; The same reasoning applies in the present ruling so that we should not be suspected of being biassed in favour of the scholar&#x2019;s presentation of the case. Hence, the scribe should not mention the names of the litigants. However, the scholar should not write himself even if he does not mention his name because the Court might recognize the scholar&#x2019;s handwriting. We do not apprehend that the Court in examining the arguments and the evidence submitted, even if the scholar&#x2019;s name is not mentioned, will conclude that one of the litigants is a scholar since the latter&#x2019;s presentation was lengthy and the other&#x2019;s was brief, &#x2014; because they will merely think that the illiterate person engaged a mandatory to write for him or that the Court itself wrote for him. Or it is quite possible that as long as the Court that is being consulted is not aware of the scholar&#x2019;s name, no suspicion is entertained &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn505">42) <italic>Tur</italic> citing <italic>SeMaG.</italic> Derived from San. 23a: &#x2018;R. Papa said: It may refer &#x2026; e.g., to the Courts of R. Huna and R. &#x1E24;isda. For he (the debtor) may say, Am I putting you to any trouble?&#x2019; This means that although the <italic>borrower is servant to the lender</italic> and cannot put the creditor to trouble in choosing the <italic>locale</italic> of judgment, yet, when the two Courts are so close to each other as those of R. Huna and R. &#x1E24;isda, the objection of the creditor to the debtor&#x2019;s choice of <italic>locale</italic> is not valid. The Court of R. &#x1E24;isda was not as renowned as that of R. Huna (cf. B.M. 33a; San. <italic>ibid., Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D2;&#x05D5;&#x05DF;</span>). Consequently, each litigant can reject the Court chosen by the other litigant and they must choose a Court that is acceptable to both. <italic>Tur, N.Yos., RaShBA</italic> reject this ruling and maintain that one may reject the Court chosen by the other only when it is either equal or inferior to the other Court, but not where it is more renowned &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn509">46) <italic>Tur.</italic> Derived from B.M. 69a-b: &#x2018;Two Cutheans (members of the sect of Samaritans) entered into a partnership (one investing money, and the other trading with it). Then one went and divided the money without consulting his partner. They appeared before R. Papa. Said he to him (the claimant): What is the difference? Thus stated R. Na&#x1E25;man: Monies are considered to be already divided. The following year they bought wine in partnership. Consequently, the other arose and divided it without the knowledge of his partner. Again they appeared before R. Papa. Said he to him: Who divided it for you? &#x2014; I notice, he answered, that you are prejudiced in my partner&#x2019;s favour (because last year you considered his division valid, whereas this year you are opposed to mine). Said R. Papa: In such a case (where the litigant doubts my impartiality) it is necesary to inform him (my reasons): With respect to coins, Would he take good ones and leave defective ones (for you)? But regarding wine, everyone knows that there is wine that is sweet and there is wine that is not sweet (hence no biassed division is possible in the case of money as there might be in the case of wine).&#x2019; Hence, the present ruling. Thus also <italic>Tosaf. ibid.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D9;</span> and <italic>Asheri</italic> on the principle <italic>then ye shall be clear before the Lord and before Israel</italic> (Num.

<ftnote id="fn510">47) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> I.e., if in the case of one who did not ask for the grounds of the verdict, the law is that if the Judge feels that he is being suspected of partiality, he must state the reasons which led to his decision, then much more so in the case of one who demands this that we must grant him his request &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> V., San. 31b and <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D0;&#x05DD;</span>.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 15: WHICH LAWSUIT MUST BE ADJUDICATED FIRST; AND THE LAW OF A SUIT THAT IS [SUSPECTED OF BEING] FRAUDULENT. Contains five paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. The Judge is required to give priority to the adjudication of a lawsuit that comes before him first [in order];<sup><xref rid="fn525">1</xref></sup> but he must give priority to a lawsuit of a scholar<sup><xref rid="fn526">2</xref></sup> even if it comes last [in order].<sup><xref rid="fn527">3</xref></sup> So too, is he [the Judge] religiously dutibound to seek whatever [points] he can [find] in his [the scholar&#x2019;s] favour.<sup><xref rid="fn528">4</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And if the scholar himself</italic> [<italic>appears</italic>] <italic>before the Judges</italic>, [<italic>then</italic>] <italic>even</italic> [<italic>if</italic>] <italic>they had already begun</italic> [<italic>to adjudicate</italic>] <italic>another lawsuit, they should judge him</italic> [<italic>the scholar</italic>] <italic>first, so that he should not be disturbed from his studies</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn529">5</xref></sup> <italic>However, if his</italic> [<italic>the scholar&#x2019;s</italic>] <italic>relative appeared for trial</italic>, [<italic>then</italic>] <italic>if they had</italic> [<italic>already</italic>] <italic>begun</italic> [<italic>to adjudicate</italic>] <italic>another lawsuit, there is no need to interrupt</italic> [<italic>the adjudication</italic>]; <italic>but if they had not</italic> [<italic>begun</italic>], <italic>they</italic> [<italic>the Judges</italic>] <italic>must judge him</italic> [<italic>the relative</italic>] <italic>first on account of showing respect for the scholar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn530">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. [If] before him [the Judge] there were many lawsuits [awaiting a legal decision],<sup><xref rid="fn531">7</xref></sup> we give priority to the orphan&#x2019;s lawsuit over the lawsuit of the widow,<sup><xref rid="fn532">8</xref></sup> and the lawsuit of the widow takes precedence over the lawsuit of a Scholar,<sup><xref rid="fn533">9</xref></sup> and the lawsuit of a Scholar takes precedence over the lawsuit of an illiterate person,<sup><xref rid="fn534">10</xref></sup> and the lawsuit of a woman takes priority over the lawsuit of a man.<sup><xref rid="fn535">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. The Judge before whom a lawsuit comes [up] which he knows to be fraudulent, should not say, &#x2018;I will decide it [in accordance with the testimony of the witnesses] and the collar<sup><xref rid="fn536">12</xref></sup> [of responsibility], <italic>i.e., the chain of guilt,</italic> will hang around the neck of the witnesses.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn537">13</xref></sup> In what manner should he act? &#x2014; He should investigate and inquire into the matter closely by means of [the methods employed in the] cross-examination and investigation of capital cases.<sup><xref rid="fn538">14</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Nevertheless, the law</italic> [<italic>of cross-examination in this case</italic>] <italic>is not</italic> [<italic>as strict</italic>] <italic>as</italic> [<italic>in</italic>] <italic>capital cases where if</italic> [<italic>a witness</italic>] <italic>stated during one of the inquiries, &#x2018;I know not,&#x2019; that the testimony becomes void; but what is meant to be said is that he</italic> [<italic>the Judge</italic>] <italic>should inquire into a fraudulent lawsuit as much as it is possible</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn539">15</xref></sup> If it appears to him [the Judge] according to his understanding that there is fraud therein, or where his common sense [directs him] not to rely upon the statements of the witnesses although he cannot [find grounds] to disqualify them, or where his [practical] judgment inclines [to assume] that this litigant is a deceiver and a cunning person and mislead the witnesses although they are eligible [witnesses] and gave evidence in ignorance of its legal bearing, and this party [the deceiving litigant] led them astray, or it appears to him [the Judge] from the general contents of the statements that there are other concealed matters therein and they are not willing to reveal them, &#x2014; [then the law is that in] all these [aforementioned] matters and anything similar to these, he is forbidden to render a legal decision in that lawsuit, but he should withdraw from this case and one whose heart [intelligence] is perfect in [the examination of] such a case should judge it and these are matters entrusted to the heart [intelligence].<sup><xref rid="fn540">16</xref></sup> When <italic>Asheri</italic> would notice on the basis of a well-grounded assumption that the lawsuit is fraudulent, he would prepare a document and place [it] in the possession of the defendant [to the effect] that no Judge should make an effort to try this lawsuit.</p>
<p>4. When does this apply?<sup><xref rid="fn541">17</xref></sup> &#x2014; Where the claimant is a deceiver. However, when the defendant is a deceiver, the Judge cannot withdraw [from the case] so that the deceiver should not be at an advantage, but he [the Judge] should examine and investigate [the defendant] closely in order to upset his deception.<sup><xref rid="fn542">18</xref></sup> And if it becomes apparent to him [the Judge] on the basis of a well-grounded assumption that he [the defendant] is guilty, he may declare him guilty [provided] if he is a recognized Judge and distinguished in his generation.<sup><xref rid="fn543">19</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>In this manner the Judge can likewise say to the defendant that he will not grant him</italic> [<italic>an extension</italic>] <italic>of time</italic> [<italic>in order to produce witnesses</italic>] <italic>until he deposits security, &#x2014; for in such matters the Judge takes into consideration only whatever seems to him</italic> [<italic>to be correct</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn544">20</xref></sup> <italic>and he</italic> [<italic>the Judge</italic>] <italic>can impose an oath even where he</italic> [<italic>the defendant</italic>] <italic>is legally not bound to take an oath, &#x2014;</italic> [<italic>provided</italic>] <italic>if he does</italic> [<italic>this</italic>] <italic>in order to ascertain the truth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn545">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. A Judge should try monetary cases in accordance with those facts to which his [practical] judgment inclines [to assume] that they are true and [provided that] the matter becomes firmly established in his heart [mind] that it is actually so, although no clear evidence is available thereon.<sup><xref rid="fn546">22</xref></sup> However, from the time that Courts of Law [whose members] are not virtuous, &#x2014; [and were they even virtuous in their deeds, are not sufficiently learned],<sup><xref rid="fn547">23</xref></sup> nor possess understanding, &#x2014; became numerous, they agreed not to transfer an oath [to an opponent] save on [the basis of] clear evidence,<sup><xref rid="fn548">24</xref></sup> nor to impair a bond and [thereby] cause damage to its legal status on the testimony of a woman or a relative,<sup><xref rid="fn549">25</xref></sup> although his [practical] judgment [is inclined to] rely on their statements.<sup><xref rid="fn550">26</xref></sup> Thus too, we do not make orphans surrender [aught nowadays] save on [the basis of] clear evidence,<sup><xref rid="fn551">27</xref></sup> nor [do we make them surrender aught] on [the basis of] the knowledge of the Judge,<sup><xref rid="fn552">28</xref></sup> nor [on grounds of] the financial position of the deceased<sup><xref rid="fn553">29</xref></sup> or the claimant.<sup><xref rid="fn554">30</xref></sup> Nevertheless, if a reliable person offered testimony in any one of the [aforementioned] matters and the [practical] judgment of the Judge inclined [to assume] that [whatever] he [the witness] is stating [is] the truth,<sup><xref rid="fn555">31</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] he [the Judge] should be patient in giving his decision and should not dismiss his testimony but should discuss [the matter] with the litigants until they confess to the statements of the witness<sup><xref rid="fn556">32</xref></sup> and he [the Judge] should examine and inquire [into the case] until [the veracity of] the matter is established,<sup><xref rid="fn556">32</xref></sup> or [until] they [the litigants] make a settlement by arbitration,<sup><xref rid="fn557">33</xref></sup> or [until] the Judge withdraws from the lawsuit as has been explained [supra].<sup><xref rid="fn556">32</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>If it becomes apparent to the Court of Law that one</italic> [<italic>of the litigants</italic>] <italic>robbed his fellow, but legally they cannot compel him to surrender it</italic> [<italic>the object acquired illegitimately</italic>], &#x2014; [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>they can issue a decree against other people not to have any dealings with him, and if it is a woman, &#x2014; that she be not married to any man nor should they conduct negotiations preliminary to her betrothal until she surrenders that which does not belong to her</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn558">34</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn525">1) San. 8a: &#x2018;<italic>Ye shall hear the small and the great alike</italic> (Deut. I, 17). Resh Lakish stated: (This verse intimates) that a lawsuit of a <italic>Perutah</italic> should be regarded by you as equally important as one involving a hundred <italic>Maneh.</italic> For what practical issue is this law stated? If it is to insist that we study the case carefully, is this not obvious&#x0021; Rather, it is to give preference to the case if it is first in order.&#x2019; <italic>&#x2018;A lawsuit that comes before him first</italic> (<italic>in order</italic>),&#x2019; means that the litigant pleaded his case first and the Judge prepared himself to listen to his case although the claim may have been filed in Court later &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn526">2) Whether he is the claimant or the defendant &#x2014; <italic>K.H., A.H.</italic> Derived from Sheb. 30a: &#x2018;R. &#x2018;Ulla, the son of R. Elai had a case before R. Na&#x1E25;man. R. Joseph sent (a communication) to him (R. Na&#x1E25;man): Our friend &#x2018;Ulla is a fellowman (i.e., a colleague, a scholar) in Torah and precepts. Said (R. Na&#x1E25;man): Why did he send (this communication) to me? (Did he mean) that I should favour him in Court? (Certainly not&#x0021;) Then he (R. Na&#x1E25;man) said: (Perhaps he meant) that I should decide his case first (so as not to detain him); or, (with respect to) discretionary judgment (i.e., to which of the claimants to adjudicate the claim in a case that does not depend on witnesses or an oath but rather on the discretion of the Judges. R. Joseph, therefore suggested that if &#x2018;Ulla&#x2019;s case was of such a nature, then because he was a scholar he should give preference to his case).&#x2019; The latter alternative possibility is omitted here because we rule today that in matters pertaining to the descretion of the Judges (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05D0; &#x05D3;&#x05D3;&#x05F2;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;</span>) the Judge must be a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> (v. Glos.). V., <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 240, 3, <italic>Gloss</italic> and Ket. 94b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05D4;</span>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn527">3) In accord with the second interpretation of Sheb. 30a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05E9;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;</span> because the positive precept of showing respect for the Torah takes precedence over the positive precept <italic>Ye shall hear the small and the great alike.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn528">4) Shab. 119a: &#x2018;Raba said: May I receive Divine reward for that when a disciple appeared before me with a lawsuit I did not rest my head upon my pillow before I had found (points) to his advantage (not as a result of partiality but rather because a scholar would not come with a lawsuit unless he was sure that he had a just claim).&#x2019; V., Sheb. 30a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;</span>. The majority of <italic>Codifiers</italic> rule that nowadays, too, a scholar enjoys this privilige &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh., A.H.</italic> a.o.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn529">5) V., B.B. 22a whence we see that in the case of scholars or Rabbis we adopt leniencies so that they should not be disturbed from their studies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn530">6) <italic>B.Yos.</italic> on the authority of <italic>RITBA</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> V., Ket. 106a whence we derive that one must also give priority to the lawsuit of a scholar&#x2019;s relative. Hence, the law is that when the scholar himself appears in Court, or sends a mandatory to replace him, or informs the Court of Law that he is sending his relative to be tried, although the latter&#x2019;s case has nothing to do with the scholar, we give priority to the scholar or his relative. However, if the scholar&#x2019;s relative came with a lawsuit and the scholar did not inform the Court concerning his relative&#x2019;s case, he has no priority rights, for in this case we are not obliged to show respect for the scholar&#x2019;s relative save in the case of the scholar&#x2019;s wife who enjoys the same privileges as her husband &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn531">7) The laws of precedence here are applicable only when they all appeared simultaneously in Court, but if one appeared first, he receives precedence save in the case of a scholar versus an illiterate person where the law is that even if he appeared last, he receives precedence (v. par 1 <italic>supra</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn532">8) <italic>Tur</italic> citing Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXI, 6. Derived from <italic>Judge the orphan, plead for the widow</italic> (Is. I, 17) quoted by Yad, <italic>ibid.</italic> Cf. however, <italic>Ye shall not afflict any widow or orphan</italic> (Ex. XXI, 21) where the <italic>widow</italic> is placed before the <italic>orphan.</italic> This presents no difficulty because the latter text speaks of <italic>affliction</italic> of the widow or orphan who are forlorn and heartbroken (v. Yad, <italic>De&#x2018;oth</italic> VI, 10) in which case the widow suffers more than the orphan (cf. San. 22b: &#x2018;The death of a man is felt by none than his wife&#x2019;). But young orphans are not mature enough to realize the gravity of their loss. Hence, in this respect the Bible gives priority to the widow. However, in the case of a lawsuit the orphans are weaker than the widow. Consequently, the orphans receive precedence &#x2014; <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn533">9) Whence it follows that the lawsuit of an orphan certainly takes precedence over that of a Scholar which contradicts the ruling in par. 1 <italic>supra</italic> which is derived from Ket. 105b-106a: where it is related that R. Anan who once accepted a gift (v. reason a.l) from a man who brought a lawsuit to him sent the latter to R. Na&#x1E25;man to whom he also sent (the following communication): &#x2018;Will the Master adjudicate (the case of) this man because I, Anan, am ineligible to act as Judge for him. Since he dispatched such a message to me, (R. Na&#x1E25;man) thought, he must be his (R. Anan&#x2019;s) relative (and one is forbidden to act as Judge or witness in a relative&#x2019;s action). An orphan&#x2019;s lawsuit was going on before him and he pondered: This one (i.e., to judge an orphan) is a positive precept and that one (to show respect for a Scholar and consequently, for his relative too) is also a positive precept, but the positive precept of showing respect for the Torah (i.e., for a Scholar on account of his learning) takes precedence. Consequently he put aside the orphan&#x2019;s lawsuit and placed before him that man&#x2019;s suit. When the other litigant noticed the honour he (R. Na&#x1E25;man) was showing him (his opponent whom R. Na&#x1E25;man thought was R. Anan&#x2019;s relative) he had nothing to say (i.e., he was intimidated).&#x2019; In order to remove the contradiction between the present ruling and that of par. 1 <italic>supra</italic> the following point should be made: In par. 1 we deal with a case where the legal guardian (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05E4;&#x05D5;&#x05D8;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05E4;&#x05D5;&#x05E1;</span>) of the orphans brought the lawsuit. This is substantiated by the expression <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D0; &#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;</span> (not <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D4;&#x05D5;&#x05D5; &#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05DE;&#x05D9; &#x05E7;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05D4;</span>) employed in Ket. <italic>ibid.,</italic> the source of the ruling that we give priority to the Scholar&#x2019;s lawsuit; in the present ruling we refer to the orphans themselves who appeared in Court &#x2014; <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn534">10) V., <italic>supra</italic> n. 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn535">11) Yeb. 100a: &#x2018;In former times, when a man and a woman (with different lawsuits) appeared before me for a legal decision, I used to settle the man&#x2019;s lawsuit first, because I was of the opinion that a man (should receive precedence) being subject to the fulfilment of all the commandments (a woman is exempt from some); when, however, I heard this (the reason why a woman should be given her share of the poor man&#x2019;s tithe first. V., Gem. a.l), I settle a woman&#x2019;s lawsuit first. Why&#x0021; So as to save her from degradation (it would be a degradation for her to have to wait her turn in a company of men).&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn536">12) Heb. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05E8;</span> from the Lat. collare, &#x2018;collar,&#x2019; the Roman prisoner&#x2019;s iron collar or chain around the neck.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn537">13) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXIV, 3. Derived from Sheb. 30b-31a: &#x2018;Whence do we know that a Judge who knows that a lawsuit is fraudulent (having reached a conclusion from the testimony of the witnesses that they spoke falsely), should not say, Since the witnesses bear testimony, I will decide the case (in accordance with their testimony) and the collar (of responsibility) will hang around the neck of the witnesses? &#x2014; For it is said: <italic>From a false matter keep far</italic> (Ex. XXIII, 7).&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn538">14) San. 32b: &#x2018;R. Papa stated (in reconciling the views of the Mishna [San. 32a] that both monetary and capital cases require examination and inquiry, and the Baraitha [ibid.] according to which examination and inquiry in civil suits are not necessary) &#x2026; In our Mishna the lawsuit is fraudulent (therefore, there must be a thorough examination and investigation), but in the other (Baraitha) the lawsuit is not fraudulent. This accords with Resh Lakish, for Resh Lakish pointed out an incongruity (between two verses): It is written, <italic>In justice</italic> (E.V. <italic>&#x2018;righteousness&#x2019;</italic>) <italic>shalt thou judge thy neighbour</italic> (Lev. XIX, 15); and (elsewhere) it is written, <italic>Justice, justice shalt thou follow</italic> (Deut. XVI, 20. The repetition of the word <italic>justice</italic> indicates a more thorough investigation). How is this possible? &#x2014; The latter verse refers to a lawsuit that is fraudulent; the former verse to a lawsuit that is not fraudulent.&#x2019; However, this passage contradicts the passage in Sheb. <italic>ibid.</italic> (v. previous note) according to which the Judge is required to withdraw from adjudicating a fraudulent lawsuit. There are in the main three views held among the <italic>Codifiers</italic> in order to reconcile these two Talmudic sources. a) <italic>Tosaf.</italic> (San. 32b, s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D0;&#x05DF;</span>) maintain that in Sheb. we deal with a lawsuit that we know to be fraudulent. Hence, the Judge is obliged to withdraw from such a case; while in San. we deal with a lawsuit that is suspected of being fraudulent. Consequently, examination and inquiry are required in order to determine for certain the fraudulence in the case. b) <italic>Maim.</italic> (Yad, <italic>ibid.</italic>) holds that both in Sheb. and San. we deal with a fraudulent lawsuit only that in Sheb. examination and inquiry had already been applied (note the expression &#x2018;A Judge who knows that a lawsuit is fraudulent).&#x2019; Consequently, we apply the verse, <italic>From a false matter keep far</italic> and the Judge must withdraw from the case. In San., however, we deal with a fraudulent lawsuit where examination and inquiry were not conducted as yet. Accordingly, there is no difference whether the plaintiff made a fraudulent claim or whether the defendant presents a dishonest case, &#x2014; the Judge must withdraw. And although the defendant may benefit according to this view, nevertheless, we are not responsible (This perhaps explains the version found in some texts of Yad <italic>ibid</italic>.: <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D9;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05DF; &#x05D0;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;&#x05D5; &#x05DE;&#x05DC;&#x05DB;&#x05D5; &#x05E9;&#x05DC; &#x05E2;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05DD;</span> &#x2018;Let the King of the world judge him&#x2019; instead of <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D9;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05E0;&#x05D5; &#x05DE;&#x05D9; &#x05E9;&#x05DC;&#x05D1;&#x05D5; &#x05E9;&#x05DC;&#x05DD;</span> &#x2018;One whose heart [intelligence] is perfect should judge it.&#x2019; In other words, even if the defendant will benefit, the &#x2018;King of the universe&#x2019; will eventually see that justice is carried out). c) <italic>Asheri</italic> reconciles the passages as follows: In Sheb. the plaintiff is the one who makes the false plea. Therefore, the Judge should withdraw; while in San. we deal with a case where the defendant is a fraudulent person. Hence, in order for the latter not to benefit, the Judge must not withdraw.

<ftnote id="fn543">19) <italic>Asheri Resp.</italic> Derived from B.B. 58a: &#x2018;A certain man over-heard his wife say to her daughter, Why are you not more guarded in your immoral conduct? I have ten children and only one is (the issue) of your father. When (the man was) lying on his deathbed, he said, I leave all my possessions to one son. They knew not to which of them he referred, so they appeared before R. Bana&#x2019;ah (to seek advice in this matter). He (R.

But the one who was really his son did not go. Whereupon (R. Bana&#x2019;ah) said to them, All the possessions belong to this one. They went and informed against him (R. Bana&#x2019;ah) before the king, saying, There is a man among the Jews who exacts money illegally from people without witnesses or any other proof. So they brought him (R. Bana&#x2019;ah) and imprisoned him etc.&#x2019; R. Bana&#x2019;ah based his opinion on a well-grounded assumption (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D3;&#x05E0;&#x05D0; &#x05D3;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05DB;&#x05D7;</span>) that the real son was the one who did not go to knock at the grave of his father (v. <italic>RaShBaM</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05DE;&#x05E8; &#x05DC;&#x05D4;&#x05DF;</span>).

Derived from Ket. 85a: &#x2018;A certain woman was declared bound to take an oath in the Court of Raba, but when the daughter of R. &#x1E24;isda (Raba&#x2019;s wife) said to him, I know that she is suspected of swearing falsely, Raba transferred the oath to her opponent (cf. Sheb. 44b where the claimant in such a case receives the amount claimed on confirmation by oath).&#x2019; Cf. <italic>ibid.</italic> a and b for similar cases.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn548">24) Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> XXIV, 2. Thus also <italic>Alfasi</italic> to Ket. <italic>ibid.</italic> For this applies only in the case of R. &#x1E24;isda&#x2019;s daughter where Raba was certain that he could rely upon her evidence and therefore transferred the oath although he had no substantial proof for acting thus, but not nowadays. <italic>MaHaRIK</italic> Rt. 108 writes that even nowadays the Judge is dutibound to judge in accordance with the facts which appear to him as true and not in accordance with the pleas of the litigants if they contradict the truth. Thus also <italic>RaShBA</italic> in <italic>Resp.</italic> &#x2014; <italic>M.E., ShaK.</italic> V., also <italic>P.Tesh</italic> that nowadays one may judge on the basis of a well-grounded assumption.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn549">25) Ket. <italic>ibid</italic>.: &#x2018;Once R. Papa and R. Adda b. Mattena sat before him (Raba) when they brought a certain bond before him. Said R. Papa to him, I know this bond has been paid up. Is there (Raba) asked him, any other person with the Master (to substantiate your statement)? No, he answered. Said the other to him, Although the Master is present (to offer testimony, the evidence of) one witness is legally not binding (<italic>Alfasi, Asheri</italic> and <italic>R. Isaiah Trani</italic> omit &#x2018;one &#x2026; binding.&#x2019; In accordance with the latter reading Raba required the corroborative testimony of another person because R. Papa was a relative to one of the contesting parties. V., <italic>Tosaf. Caro</italic> follows this latter reading). Said R. Adda b. Mattena to him, Should not R. Papa be (regarded as trustworthy) as the daughter of R. &#x1E24;isda (whose evidence was considered adequate to invalidate the defendant from taking an oath)? &#x2014; (As far as) the daughter of R. &#x1E24;isda (is concerned) I am certain of her (i.e., I deem her evidence reliable); I am not certain, however, about the Master (because he is related to one of the parties. This follows Alfasi&#x2019;s reading <italic>supra</italic>). Said R. Papa, Now that the Master has stated (that the assertion of a Judge), <italic>I am certain of a person</italic> is considered reliable, I would tear up a bond on the testimony of my son Abba Mar of whose trustworthiness I am certain. I would <italic>tear</italic> up&#x0021; Is that imaginable (certainly the testimony of two witnesses is required)? &#x2014; But (what he meant was), I would impair a bond on his testimony (i.e., the one who produces the bond would have to substantiate the contents thereof by taking an oath before payment could be demanded &#x2014; <italic>Tosaf</italic>.).&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn550">26) Note the expression &#x2018;I am certain&#x2019; employed in Ket. <italic>ibid.</italic> Consequently, if the evidence of R. Papa who was referred to by Rabba as a very learned and wise man (v. Men. 71a; Nid. 12b on the expression <span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;</span> in accord with the interpretation of <italic>Rashi</italic> and <italic>R. Gershon</italic>) was not deemed reliable, much more so nowadays we cannot rely on such evidence even if we are certain that it is trustworthy. V., however, <italic>supra</italic> n. 24 end.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn551">27) V., <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 297, 1 where this ruling is explained. Cf. Ket. 85b where a number of cases are reported that when a person dies intestate and a claim is made against the orphans to return a deposit, which the latter maintain might have belonged to the deceased from whom they inherited it, the law is that a) if the deceased was not a wealthy man and consequently could not have been the owner of the deposit, and b) the claimant indicates identification marks, and c) the depositor was not a frequent visitor at the house of the bailee and did not see the deposit, &#x2014; we return the deposit to the claimant, but not nowadays. <italic>Alfasi</italic> and <italic>Asheri</italic> maintain that even today this ruling would be in force. Hence, it is not understandable why <italic>Isserles</italic> does not report their ruling in the present par. &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn552">28) As stated in Ket. 85b where the expression &#x2018;I know that he (the person who died intestate) was not wealthy&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05D3;&#x05E2;&#x05E0;&#x05D0; &#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05D4; &#x05D3;&#x05DC;&#x05D0; &#x05D0;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05D3;</span>) is employed, i.e., the Judge himself must be certain and even witnesses are not accepted (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 297, derived from Yad, <italic>She&#x2019;elah</italic> VI, 4.

<ftnote id="fn553">29) As stated in Ket. <italic>ibid</italic>.: &#x2018;I know that he (the deceased) was not wealthy.&#x2019; This, however, is no proof because a person may appear to be poor but in reality is wealthy or may have received the object as a gift.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 16: HOW MUCH TIME IS GIVEN TO PRODUCE EVIDENCE AND THE LAW OF PROCLAIMING A BAN. Contains five paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. [If] one of the litigants<sup><xref rid="fn559">1</xref></sup> said, &#x2018;[Give me an extension of time because] I can produce witnesses,&#x2019; they allow him thirty days,<sup><xref rid="fn560">2</xref></sup> and after thirty days [if no witnesses were produced by him], they issue the verdict, <italic>and he is obliged to make payment</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn561">3</xref></sup> If, however, he produces them [the witnesses] later, it [the Court] can upset the verdict.<sup><xref rid="fn562">4</xref></sup> If it is well known to the Court of Law that So-and-so are witnesses in the matter but they have moved far away, he is given time until he can produce [them].<sup><xref rid="fn563">5</xref></sup> <italic>Likewise if it is known to the Court of Law that he can verify his statements within the thirty</italic> [<italic>days</italic>], <italic>they do not give him</italic> [<italic>additional</italic>] <italic>time for nothing</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn564">6</xref></sup> <italic>V., infra &#x00A7; 98, 4</italic>.</p>
<p>2. As to the ruling<sup><xref rid="fn565">7</xref></sup> that they give [the claimant] a period of thirty days [to bring proof or to produce witnesses] &#x2014; it applies only<sup><xref rid="fn566">8</xref></sup> when they [the Judges] summoned him at first without evidence [submitted by the claimant] and the Court of Law [issued a verdict and] required him [the defendant] to take an oath, while the other party [the claimant] pleads, &#x2018;I have evidence, but it is not in my possession at present, and I desire not to accept his [the defendant&#x2019;s] oath,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn567">9</xref></sup> then [the law is that] they give him a period of thirty days [to produce the evidence]. However, if he [the claimant] pleaded at first [i.e., before the verdict was given], &#x2018;I have evidence, but it is not in my possession at present,&#x2019; [then] what need is there to grant him time<sup><xref rid="fn568">10</xref></sup> [to produce the evidence]? [Consequently, the law is that only] when he [the claimant] produces [it], the defendant must respond to him [the claimant], and as long as he [the claimant] produces no [evidence], he [the defendant] must not respond to him [by making] any [counter-] plea. If he [the claimant] returned and stated, &#x2018;I have no evidence,&#x2019; he [the defendant] responds to him without [producing] any evidence<sup><xref rid="fn569">11</xref></sup> [to substantiate his counter-plea]. There is an authority who states that he [the defendant] takes an oath and is exempt and [if the claimant] still [promises] to produce evidence, he is not relied upon.<sup><xref rid="fn570">12</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>If the defendant requests</italic> [<italic>an extension of</italic>] <italic>time in order to respond to the plea of the claimant,</italic> [<italic>then</italic>] <italic>if it becomes apparent to the Court of Law that it is</italic> [<italic>intended</italic>] <italic>only</italic> [<italic>as</italic>] <italic>a</italic> [<italic>mere</italic>] <italic>delay</italic> [<italic>of the case</italic>], <italic>they do not grant him</italic> [<italic>an extension of</italic>] <italic>time, and he must respond forthwith. However, if it appears to the Court of Law that he does require</italic> [<italic>an extension of</italic>] <italic>time in order to examine and consider carefully the matters concerning him and the other party, they give him</italic> [<italic>an extension of</italic>] <italic>time as much as he requires.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn571">13</xref></sup> <italic>But if in the bond</italic> [<italic>produced by the claimant</italic>] <italic>it is written that he must pay him without delay,</italic> [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>every stipulation made in monetary matters is binding.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn572">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. [If] one of the litigants pleaded, &#x2018;There are witnesses or [other] evidence in my favour but I know not through whom this [could be made available],&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn573">15</xref></sup> the Judge is obliged to pronounce the ban against any person who knows [aught] in his favour through witnesses or [other] evidence, [viz.,] that he make this known to the Judge,<sup><xref rid="fn574">16</xref></sup> even if the one who is his opponent [in Court] knows about the favourable opinion of the witnesses and the [other] evidence, he is obliged to state [it].<sup><xref rid="fn575">17</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>V., infra &#x00A7; 71, 7-8 in what manner we pronounce the ban and v. infra &#x00A7; 92, 6</italic> [<italic>the law</italic>] <italic>if</italic> [<italic>the litigant</italic>] <italic>pleads that his opponent is ineligible to take an oath whether we pronounce the ban concerning this.</italic></p>
<p>4. One who says to his fellow,<sup><xref rid="fn576">18</xref></sup> &#x2018;You possess a document in which there are rights in my favour,&#x2019; &#x2014; [then] if the latter admits that the person concerned has rights therein, he is obliged to produce it in the Court of Law and the Court of Law makes a copy of whatever is recorded therein concerning his rights.<sup><xref rid="fn577">19</xref></sup> However, if the other party says that he possesses<sup><xref rid="fn578">20</xref></sup> no document wherein any rights in favour of the person concerned are found, they do not require him to show a document to any person. But if the person concerned desires to proclaim a general ban,<sup><xref rid="fn579">21</xref></sup> &#x2014; [viz.,] that whosoever has in his possession a document wherein there are rights [recorded] in his favour should show it [to the Court of Law], &#x2014; he may do so.<sup><xref rid="fn580">22</xref></sup> And if the person concerned pleaded with certainty that he knows that the document wherein there are [recorded] rights in his favour are in his [the other person&#x2019;s] possession, [then] the latter takes an equitable oath<sup><xref rid="fn581">23</xref></sup> that it is not in his possession.<sup><xref rid="fn582">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. One who produces a note [of indebtedness] against his fellow, and the latter claims that there is a forgery<sup><xref rid="fn583">25</xref></sup> in it, and he demanded that they give him a copy of the document in order to examine it carefully, &#x2014; [the law is that] they give it to him although there is written in it, &#x2018;[This note is binding] without [any stipulation for additional] copies of this document to be made.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn584">26</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn559">1) Whether the claimant or the defendant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn560">2) B.K. 112b: &#x2018;Raba said: The law is that a document may be verified by its signatories even not in the presence of the other party; and even if he cries aloud before us (that the document was forged). But if he says, Give me time until I can produce witnesses, and I will impair the document, we allow him time (generally thirty days &#x2014; B.M. 118a).&#x2019; If the defendant is willing to take an oath but the claimant would rather wait until he produces his witnesses or other evidence, we grant him a postponement of thirty days only (v. <italic>infra</italic> par. 2), provided the property of the defendant depreciates in value (i.e., where he must sell his estate at a high price and should there be any delay in the settlement of his counter-claim, this opportunity would not present itself later); but if, as a result of the postponement, the defendant&#x2019;s property does not depreciate in value, we allow the claimant an unlimited extension of time. Should, however, the claimant not state that he can verify the matter were he to be given more time, and the property of the defendant depreciates in value, the law is that even the thirty days are not given &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 24. The extension of thirty days is given to people in general, but if it is definitely knows that the litigant is a powerful person who defies the law, v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 98, 4 &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn561">3) <italic>Mord.</italic> to San. III end &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Or if the defendant is willing to take an oath and thus be exempt he may do so. Cf. also <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 14, 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn562">4) Mishna San. 31a: &#x2018;Whenever he (any of the litigants) can produce proof, the Court can reverse the verdict. However, if they said to him, Produce all the proofs that you may have within thirty days, and he produced them within thirty days, the Court reverses the verdict; but (if he produced proof) after thirty days, the Court cannot upset the verdict. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel stated: What should he do who did not find (evidence) within the thirty days but found it after thirty days?&#x2019; The present ruling is in accord with Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel. Cf. also <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 87, 30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn563">5) Thus <italic>Asheri</italic> in <italic>Resp.</italic> Derived from B.K. 46b: &#x2018;R. Na&#x1E25;man stated on the authority of Rabbah b. Abbuha: Whence do we know that the Court should attend to the first claimant (i.e., when <italic>A</italic> brought legal proceedings against <italic>B</italic> [and according to some versions of <italic>Rashi, A</italic> has witnesses or a document substantiating his claim, so that <italic>B</italic> cannot say that he paid] and the latter made a counter-claim against <italic>A.</italic> Thus <italic>Rashi. Tosaf.</italic> [according to one interpretation] s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>, explain as follows. After <italic>A</italic> instituted an action against <italic>B,</italic> the latter stated that there were witnesses available at the time of the act who could corroborate his counter-claim, and we deal here with a case where the Court also knows that witnesses were available at the time of the act. Consequently, were it not for the Biblical text [v. anon] we might have said that under these circumstances the Court should give him ample time until he produces the witnesses. Therefore, we are informed that this is not so, but we give prior consideration to <italic>A</italic>&#x2019;s claim)? &#x2014; For it is said: <italic>If any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them</italic> (Ex. XXIV, 14), (i.e.,) let him cause his matters to come (first) before them.&#x2019; <italic>Tosaf. ibid.</italic> (according to a second interpretation) explain that we deal here with a case where <italic>A</italic> claims that <italic>B</italic> injured him, and <italic>B</italic> advances a counter-claim, in which case the law is that <italic>A</italic>&#x2019;s claim is given prior consideration even if <italic>B</italic> states that he can produce witnesses in a day or two &#x2014; because no extension of time is given in the case of injury (B.K. 91a). <italic>Tosaf.</italic> accept the second interpretation, viz., that we deal here with cases of injury. Consequently, the above verse refers <italic>only</italic> to cases of injury. Hence, according to the first interpretation of <italic>Tosaf.</italic> to which the above verse does not apply, <italic>B</italic> would be given time until he can produce his witnesses. This is the source of <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s text on the authority of <italic>Asheri.</italic> Thus <italic>W.G.</italic> V., <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn564">6) <italic>B.Yos.</italic> on the authority of <italic>RITBA</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> V., B.M. 118a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D6;&#x05DE;&#x05DF;</span> end. This ruling means that even where no loss would be sustained by the fellow-litigant were we to give the claimant an extension of time. Even if we are not aware whether he deliberately wishes to postpone the case for the present or not, but we know that his opponent suffers a loss thereby, the law is that he must produce evidence within thirty days &#x2014; <italic>M.E., ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn565">7) <italic>Supra</italic> par. 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn566">8) <italic>Tur</italic> citing <italic>R. Isaiah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn567">9) Although the claimant may produce witnesses or other proof subsequent to the oath and thus upset the verdict (v. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1), nevertheless, if we wait until he produces proof, the defendant might confess, but not if he had already taken the oath &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn568">10) Likewise in the case of one who pleaded that he lost his bonds through unavoidable circumstances and it is impossible for him to produce them because of the distance involved in order to obtain them (<italic>RIBaSh</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn569">11) As in the case of all oral claims.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn570">12) V. Mishna San. 31a: &#x2018;If they said to him, Bring witnesses, and he answered, I have no witnesses, or (if they said), Bring proof, and he said, I have no proof, and subsequently he produced proof or found witnesses, it has no legal effect (since he might have produced false witnesses or brought a forged document). Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: What should he do who did not know that witnesses were available, but found them later, or who did not know that he had proof, but found it later (consequently, both the proof and the witnesses should be accepted)?&#x2019; The law in this case rests with the First Tanna. Hence, the ruling here. By stating the ruling here in the name of &#x2018;some say,&#x2019; <italic>Caro</italic> disagrees with it, although none of the <italic>Codifiers</italic> question this law. It is quite possible that <italic>Caro</italic> (v. <italic>B.Yos</italic>.) contests this ruling not because the <italic>Codifiers</italic> differ with it, but rather because it is not mentioned by the latter &#x2014; <italic>M.E., P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn571">13) <italic>B.Yos.</italic> on the authority of <italic>RaShBA</italic> in <italic>Resp.</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn572">14) <italic>B.Yos.</italic> on the authority of <italic>RITBA</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> V., B.M. 94a; Ket. 56a a.e., &#x2018;A stipulation made in monetary matters is valid.&#x2019; The following is the full text of <italic>RITBA</italic>: &#x2018;If in the bond it is written that he must pay him at the appointed time without delay and without any demands for an extension of time by the Court, the stipulation is binding.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn573">15) <italic>Tur</italic> citing <italic>Asheri</italic> in <italic>Resp.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn574">16) V. B.K. 56a where among the acts which are enumerated by R. Joshua for which an offender is exempt from the judgments of man but held responsible to the judgments of Heaven, is found the following: &#x2018;One who knows evidence in favour of his fellow but does not testify on his behalf. What is the case before us? If a case where there are two (witnesses), is it not self-evident that it is based on a Biblical verse (why then should it be mentioned here?), (for it is written), <italic>If he do not utter it then he shall bear his iniquity</italic> (Lev. V, 1)? &#x2014; It refers to a case where there is one (witness whose testimony merely imposes an oath upon the defendant &#x2014; v. Sheb. 40a).&#x2019; We thus see that two witnesses who withhold evidence commit a Scriptural offence and even in the case of one witness, he is still held responsible to the judgments of Heaven. Consequently, we should do everything in our power to restrain one from transgression. V., <italic>infra</italic> n. 21.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 17: TO REGARD THE LITIGANTS AS EQUALS IN EVERY RESPECT. Contains twelve paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. &#x2018;In righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn585">1</xref></sup> What is considered righteousness of the Law? &#x2014; It means to regard the two litigants as equals in every respect, [viz., that] one should not be permitted to speak as long as he needs and the other be told, &#x2018;Make your speech brief;&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn586">2</xref></sup> [that] one should not be favourable to one [litigant] and speak soft words to him, and severe to the other [litigant] and speak harsh words to him.<sup><xref rid="fn587">3</xref></sup> If one of them is wearing expensive garments and the other is wearing shabby garments, they [the Judges] should say to the one who is well dressed, &#x2018;Either dress him like you, or dress like him.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn588">4</xref></sup> Nor should one [litigant] sit and the other stand, but both should stand.<sup><xref rid="fn589">5</xref></sup> If, however, the Court of Law desires to permit them both to sit, they may do so.<sup><xref rid="fn590">6</xref></sup> Nor should one [litigant] sit on a higher level and the other on a lower level, but one next to the other.<sup><xref rid="fn591">7</xref></sup> When does this apply?<sup><xref rid="fn592">8</xref></sup> &#x2014; At the time of the discussion <italic>of the pleas,</italic><sup><xref rid="fn593">9</xref></sup> but at the time of the conclusion of the case, both litigants must stand in the first instance.<sup><xref rid="fn594">10</xref></sup> What is considered the conclusion of the case? &#x2014; [When the verdict is pronounced,] &#x2018;[So-and-so, You are not guilty,&#x2019; or &#x2018;So-and-so, you are guilty.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn595">11</xref></sup> [With respect to] the witnesses [the law is that] in the first instance they must always [testify] while standing.<sup><xref rid="fn596">12</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And standing by being supported is indeed regarded as standing with respect to this matter</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn597">13</xref></sup> <italic>V., however, infra &#x00A7; 28,</italic> [<italic>26</italic>].</p>
<p>2. [In the case of] a Rabbinical scholar and an illiterate person who appeared for trial, [the law is that] we urge the scholar to sit down, and we [also] say to the illiterate person, &#x2018;Sit down&#x0021;&#x2019; And if he [the illiterate person] did not sit down, we do not mind.<sup><xref rid="fn598">14</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: [<italic>When</italic>] <italic>a scholar comes to Court for trial, it is permissible to rise before him and we do not apprehend that the pleas of his opponent will be stopped up</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn599">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. It has already become the adopted practice [among] all the Courts of Law in Israel after the [close of] the Talmud that they permit the litigants and also the witnesses to be seated<sup><xref rid="fn600">16</xref></sup> in order to eliminate dissension,<sup><xref rid="fn601">17</xref></sup> for we are [nowadays] powerless to maintain the laws of our faith in conformity with their original authoritativeness.<sup><xref rid="fn602">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. If the <italic>claimants are many</italic> and the defendant states, &#x2018;I desire that my friends and relatives sit near me when I plead against you so that my pleas be not stopped up because you are the majority,&#x2019; &#x2014; the law rests with him.<sup><xref rid="fn603">19</xref></sup> <italic>Therefore,</italic> partners should select one of them to plead on behalf of all of them, or each one pleads consecutively. And the defendant also should not take his friends with him.<sup><xref rid="fn604">20</xref></sup> V., <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 176, par. 35.</p>
<p>5. It is forbidden to the Judge to hear the words [pleas] of one litigant in the absence of his fellow-litigant.<sup><xref rid="fn605">21</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And this applies only when the Judge knows that he will act as Judge in the case; but if he had</italic> [<italic>already</italic>] <italic>heard the pleas of one party and subsequently the second party was satisfied to be tried before him, he is permitted to act as Judge in the case</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn606">22</xref></sup> <italic>No Sage should write a decision for one of the litigants in</italic> [<italic>the following</italic>] <italic>manner,</italic> [<italic>viz.,</italic>] <italic>&#x2018;If such</italic> [<italic>are the circumstances of the case which this litigant set forth before me, then the law would be as follows</italic>],&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn607">23</xref></sup> <italic>or</italic> [<italic>even</italic>] <italic>write for him</italic> [<italic>the litigant</italic>] <italic>his opinion without</italic> [<italic>giving</italic>] <italic>a</italic> [<italic>definitive</italic>] <italic>decision as long as he did not hear the words</italic> [<italic>claims</italic>] <italic>of both</italic> [<italic>litigants</italic>] <italic>lest from his</italic> [<italic>the Judge&#x2019;s</italic>] <italic>words they will learn to utter lies</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn608">24</xref></sup> [<italic>and</italic>] <italic>furthermore because later the second</italic> [<italic>litigant</italic>] <italic>will plead in a different manner and he</italic> [<italic>the Judge</italic>] <italic>will</italic> [<italic>then</italic>] <italic>be obliged to write the reverse and disrepute will be brought thereby on the Sage.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn609">25</xref></sup> Likewise, is the litigant cautioned against [acting] thus.<sup><xref rid="fn610">26</xref></sup> A scholar who has a case before his teacher should not arrive [at Court] first, [i.e.,] prior to his opponent so that it should not appear that he is [arriving first] in order to clarify his pleas in the absence of his fellow [-litigant]. However, if he has an appointed time to come and study before him and that time had arrived, he is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn611">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. The Judge should not hear [the pleas of the litigant] from the mouth of an interpreter.<sup><xref rid="fn612">28</xref></sup> [However,] if he knows their language and understands their pleas, save that<sup><xref rid="fn613">29</xref></sup> he does not know their language well enough that he should know how to reply to them, [viz.,] to inform them the verdict, &#x2014; he is permitted to appoint an interpreter. <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>V., supra &#x00A7;13, par. 3 whether they may present their pleas in writing. If one party desires to plead in one language and the other party in another language,</italic> [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>one</italic> [<italic>litigant</italic>] <italic>cannot compel his fellow</italic> [<italic>litigant</italic>] <italic>to plead in his language</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn614">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. The Judge must hear<sup><xref rid="fn615">31</xref></sup> the claims of the litigants and [then] repeat them,<sup><xref rid="fn616">32</xref></sup> for it is written, &#x2018;Then said the king: The one saith: This is my son that liveth [and thy son is the dead; and the other saith: Nay; but thy son is the dead and my son is the living],&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn617">33</xref></sup> and he makes the case clear in his heart [mind] and then decides it.<sup><xref rid="fn618">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. A Judge who renders a legal decision and his heart smites him, <italic>i.e., it strikes him and he is conscience-smitten,</italic> that is to say, he [realizes that he] is erroneous [in his decision], should not strengthen his words to advance proofs [in order] to substantiate them being ashamed to retract, but he should again [re-examine] all the points [of the case] in order to execute the law in accordance with its truth.<sup><xref rid="fn619">35</xref></sup> The Judge should not act as an advocate for the litigant&#x2019;s words, but he [the litigant] should state whatever appears to him [as valid argumentation relating to his case] and he [the Judge] should keep his silence.<sup><xref rid="fn620">36</xref></sup> [The Judge] must not instruct at all [any] one of the litigants [by furnishing him with directives in pleading]. Even if one of the litigants produced [only] a single witness, he [the Judge] should not say to him [the litigant], &#x2018;We do not make one liable to pay money on the testimony of a single witness,&#x2019; but he should [merely] say to the defendant, &#x2018;Behold this party has testified against you,&#x2019; [and he should not furnish him with directives in pleading] until he [the litigant himself] pleads and states, &#x2018;A single witness is not reliable concerning me.&#x2019; And likewise, anything similar to this.<sup><xref rid="fn621">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. [If] the Judge noticed aught in favour of one of the parties and the litigant [who is aware of this] desires to state it but knows not how to put together [his] arguments, or they [the Judges] saw him having trouble to defend himself in [the presentation of his] true pleas and [only] on account of [his] excitement and anger [this valid argumentation] escaped him, or he became confused because of ineptitude, &#x2014; [the law is that] in such a case he [the Judge] is permitted to assist him and give him to understand [how to present] the opening of [his] case on account of &#x2018;Open thy mouth for the dumb.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn622">38</xref></sup> However, one must give very careful consideration regarding this matter in order not to play the part of an advocate.<sup><xref rid="fn623">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. A Judge should not show mercy towards a poor person [who is a party] in a lawsuit, [viz.,] that he [the Judge] should not say, &#x2018;This man is poor and his adversary is wealthy and he is required to support him; [therefore,] I will pronounce judgment in his favour and he [the poor man] will thus make a respectable living.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn624">40</xref></sup> Nor may [the Judge] favour the person of the mighty, [viz.,] that if there appeared before him a wealthy person or a distinguished scholar with a poor man or an ignorant person [respectively], he should not show <span class="underline">him</span> [the wealthy person or scholar] honour,<sup><xref rid="fn625">41</xref></sup> nor should he extend a greeting to him, so that the words of his adversary [the poor or ignorant person] should not become stopped up; nor should he [the Judge] say, &#x2018;How can I pronounce him guilty at the trial for he will thus be put to shame, only I will acquit him and subsequently I will say to him that he should give him whatever rightfully belongs to him,&#x2019; &#x2014; but [the law is that] he should issue the verdict forthwith in accordance with its truth.<sup><xref rid="fn626">42</xref></sup> If before him appeared one [litigant who] is a worthy person and another [litigant who] is a wicked person, he should not say, &#x2018;This one is a wicked person and has the status of making false statements and that one has the status that he does not change [i.e., stands by] his word,<sup><xref rid="fn627">43</xref></sup> [consequently,] I will turn the verdict against the wicked person,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn628">44</xref></sup> &#x2014; but the two litigants should be regarded by him as if they were [both of them] wicked [guilty] on the presumption that each one of them is making a false claim.<sup><xref rid="fn629">45</xref></sup> And the [Judge] should adjudicate [the lawsuit] according to that which becomes apparent to him [as a result of] the arguments, and when they leave his presence they should be regarded by him as if they were [both of them] worthy [guiltless] after having accepted the verdict,<sup><xref rid="fn630">46</xref></sup> and he should judge each one in the scale of merit.<sup><xref rid="fn631">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. The Judge is obliged to issue the verdict forthwith, [i.e., immediately] after it becomes absolutely certain to him, for if he delays<sup><xref rid="fn632">48</xref></sup> judgment and [unduly] prolongs [the examination of] established matters in order [thereby] to afflict one of the litigants, such a one falls into the category of &#x2018;Ye shall do no unrighteousness [in judgment].&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn633">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. When one of the litigants threatens his fellow [-litigant] in the presence of the Judge and says to him, &#x2018;[Were I to make] such and such [a claim] you would be held liable to [pay] me according to the law,&#x2019; &#x2014; [then] if the law is not so, the Judge is obliged to say to him, &#x2018;You are making a false statement.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn634">50</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>A litigant who made a claim against his fellow for a small amount and the Judge sees that according to the law</italic> [<italic>the defendant</italic>] <italic>would be liable</italic> [<italic>to pay</italic>] <italic>more than the amount which was claimed, the Judge should not give a decision</italic> [<italic>that the defendant pay</italic>] <italic>more than that which was claimed, and if he</italic> [<italic>the Judge</italic>] <italic>decided for him</italic> [<italic>the claimant</italic>] <italic>a larger</italic> [<italic>amount than he claimed</italic>], <italic>it is considered an error in judgment and he may retract</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn635">51</xref></sup></p>

It would likewise be forbidden even if the Judge were to say only to one of the litigants, &#x2018;Make your speech brief,&#x2019; and not give the other litigant instructions to speak at length.

<ftnote id="fn589">5) V. <italic>supra</italic> n. 2. According to Tosef(Z). <italic>ibid</italic>.: &#x2018;The Judge should not make one stand (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E2;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05D3;</span>) and the other sit (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05D1;</span>),&#x2019; whence it follows that if one sits down and the other remains standing of their own accord, it would be permissible &#x2014; <italic>Ba&#x1E24;.</italic> This is however, rejected by <italic>Keneseth ha-Gedolah</italic> &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn590">6) Sheb. 30a: Tosef(Z). <italic>ibid.</italic> in accord with R. Judah: &#x2018;Our Rabbis taught: <italic>And the two men shall stand</italic> (Deut. XIX, 17): it is a religious duty that the litigants stand. R. Judah stated: I heard that if they (the Judges) desire to permit them both to sit, they may do so.&#x2019; Although R. Judah represents an individual opinion and we would ordinarily rule in accordance with the Rabbis who represent the majority, nevertheless, since the second Baraitha (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 2) and all the cases cited in Sheb. 30a,b harmonize with R. Judah&#x2019;s view, the law rests with him. The litigants, however, are not permitted to sit down of their own accord, and if they did so, the Judge must ask them to rise, and subsequently, if they desire to permit them to sit, they may do so. According to this explanation it is understandable why King Jannai who was summoned to be present during the trial of his slave who killed a man (v. San. 19a) was told by Simeon b. Sheta&#x1E25; when the latter noticed that Jannai sat down after he arrived at Court, &#x2018;Stand on your feet King Jannai and let the witnesses offer testimony against you&#x2019; (v. San. <italic>ibid., Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;</span>; Sheb. 30a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D0;&#x05DD;</span> who point out a difficulty which is removed by this explanation) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn591">7) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXI, 3. Cf. Tan&#x1E25;(B). <italic>Shofetim</italic> VI to Deut. XVI, 19: <italic>Thou shalt not respect persons</italic>: &#x2018;(This text) is a warning to the <italic>Nasi</italic> not to seat one who is worthy to be (only) on a lower level &#x2014; on a higher level, and one who is worthy to be on a higher level &#x2014; on a lower level.&#x2019; However, this text implies that it would be permissible to seat one on a higher level who is worthy of this honour and likewise one who only deserves to be seated on a lower level should not be seated higher than his position demands. Hence, this text contradicts our present ruling. Nevertheless, since we deal in our ruling with individuals who are considered equals, therefore our text does apply (v. <italic>&#x2018;E&#x1E93; Yosef</italic> in cur. edd. of Tan&#x1E25;.). Should, however, one litigant <italic>stand</italic> on a higher level and the other on a lower one, it does not matter &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> The underlying reason for regarding the litigants as equals is in order to avoid disheartening on the part of a litigant who is not treated as an equal and thereby forgets his pleas.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn592">8) That if the Court desires to permit them both to sit, they may do so.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn593">9) Sheb. 30b: &#x2018;R. Huna sated: The controversy of opinion is with respect to the time of the discussion (i.e., while the case is being debated), but at the time of the conclusion of the case (when the verdict is given) all agree that the Judges sit and the litigants stand, for it is written, <italic>And Moses sat to Judge the people; and the people stood</italic> (Ex. XVIII, 13).&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn594">10) For in the case of witnesses it is only in the first instance that they must stand (v. <italic>infra</italic> n. 12), but if they gave their testimony while sitting, it is valid <italic>ex post facto.</italic> V., Sheb. 30b: &#x2018;Ulla stated: The controversy of opinion is with respect to the litigants, but with respect to witnesses all agree that they must stand, for it is written, <italic>And the two men shall stand</italic> &#x2026; Another version (reads): The controversy of opinion is with respect to the time of discussion, but at the time of the conclusion of the case all agree that the Judges sit and the litigants stand, for <italic>witnesses</italic> are like the conclusion of the case (when they offer their testimony the case is completed), and it is written with respect to them: <italic>And the two men shall stand</italic>.&#x2019; Hence, the law that litigants must stand at the time of the conclusion of the case is derived from witnesses whose testimony is like the conclusion of the case, and therefore, the law should not be more stringent in the case of the litigants than in that of the witnesses. Consequently, as in the case of witnesses the law that testimony must be offered while standing is applicable in the first instance, but if the evidence was given while sitting it is considered valid <italic>ex post facto,</italic> so too, in the case of the litigants it is valid <italic>ex post facto</italic> if presented in a sitting position.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn596">12) Sheb. 30b in accord with &#x2018;Ulla.

VII(V), 1). <italic>Testimony</italic> is explained by R. Jo&#x1E25;anan in Y. Git. VII, 1(48d) to refer to &#x2018;one who offers testimony while sitting.&#x2019; This according to <italic>W.G.</italic> refers to one who is sick, since one who is struck dumb must have become so as a result of sickness and yet, we see that his testimony is considered valid through the test of nodding the head. Hence, it follows that if one testified while sitting, his testimony is considered valid <italic>ex post facto</italic> (cf. Tosef. <italic>ibid.</italic> where <span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D4; &#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;&#x05E7;</span> is mentioned).

<ftnote id="fn597">13) <italic>RIBaSh</italic> s. 266 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Meg. 21a (ref. to Mishna: &#x2018;One who reads the <italic>Megillah</italic> may do so while standing or sitting&#x2019;): &#x2018;A Tanna stated: This (namely, that one may read the <italic>Megillah</italic> while standing or sitting) does not apply to the Torah (the reading of the Torah in public). Whence is this derived? &#x2014; R. Abbahu said: Because the Scriptural verse states, <italic>But as for thee, stand thou here by me</italic> (Deut. V, 28) &#x2026; One verse states, <italic>And I sat</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D0;&#x05E9;&#x05D1;</span>) <italic>in the mount</italic> (Deut. IX, 9) and another verse states, <italic>And I stood</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05DE;&#x05D3;&#x05EA;&#x05D9;</span>) <italic>in the mount</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> X, 10) &#x2014; Rab said: He (Moses) stood when he learnt and sat when he reviewed (his learning). R. &#x1E24;anina said: He was neither standing nor sitting but stooping.&#x2019; Hence, we see that stooping is designated neither standing nor sitting and yet the verse (<italic>I stood</italic>) refers to it as standing. Consequently, standing while leaning against something (equivalent to stooping) is still called standing. <italic>Leaning</italic> would therefore, include both standing and sitting. It is designated <italic>standing</italic> where this would be the requirement of the law as in the present ruling, and <italic>sitting</italic> where the law requires it as <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 28, 26 where standing (in the case of Judges) by being supported is not considered standing but rather sitting in accord with the First Tanna in Zeb. 19b. Cf. E.H. &#x00A7; 169, 45; Zeb. 19b, Tosaf. s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05D9;&#x05D1;</span>; Yoma 25a and Tosaf. s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>; Y. Meg. IV, 1(74d). Hence, if Judges who are required to sit, stood by means of some support, or if witnesses who are required to stand, did so only by means of support, we adopt a leniency in both cases and consider standing by means of support in the case of Judges as sitting and in the case of witnesses as standing. This however, would not be valid if in the same lawsuit that is being tried both the Judges and the witnesses stood by being supported &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn598">14) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXI, 4. Derived from Sheb. 30b: &#x2018;Rabbah b. R. Huna said: When a scholar and an illiterate person are in dispute with each other (and appear for trial), we urge the scholar to sit down; and to the illiterate person we also say, Sit down, and if he stands we do not care.&#x2019; If they told the illiterate person to be seated but the Court-messenger made him stand up, it is not obligatory for the Judge to tell him to sit down again. This is derived from Sheb. <italic>ibid</italic>.: &#x2018;Rab b. Sherabya had a lawsuit tried before R. Papa. He told him to sit down and told his opponent also to sit down. However, the Court-messenger came and insulted (lit. &#x2018;kicked&#x2019;) the illiterate person and made him stand up and R. Papa did not say to him, Sit down. How could he act thus; will not the other&#x2019;s plea be stopped up (i.e., he will be intimidated on seeing that R. Papa accords more honour to his opponent)? &#x2014; R. Papa may say: He (the ignorant man) will say, He (R. Papa) has requested me to sit down, but the (court-) messenger was not appeased by me (i.e., I have not given him a gratuity, so he made me stand).&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn599">15) <italic>RaN</italic> to Sheb. IV &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> This applies only to a scholar because all know that one must rise before him and likewise to the wife of a scholar who is still living (and intimidation would not apply); but if the scholar is no longer alive, we do not accord his wife this honour.

<ftnote id="fn600">16) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXI, 5.

<ftnote id="fn601">17) For very often this may lead to strife.

<ftnote id="fn605">21) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXI, 7. Derived from Sheb. 31a: &#x2018;Whence do we know that a Judge must not hear the claims of one litigant before his fellow-litigant arrives? &#x2014; For it is said: <italic>&#x2018;From a false matter keep far</italic> (Ex. XXIII, 7).&#x2019; San. 7b: <italic>&#x2018;Hear</italic> (the causes) <italic>between your brethren and judge righteously</italic> (Deut. I, 16). Said. R. &#x1E24;anina, This is a warning to the Court of Law not to hear the claims of one litigant before his fellow-litigant arrives (Because in the absence of the other party he will not refrain from stating false pleas).&#x2019; However, if the Judge had already heard the claims of one litigant in the absence of the other litigant, it is permissible for him to try the case. But, if after listening to one litigant, he gave the latter a written ruling in accordance with the majority of the <italic>Codifiers and Responsa,</italic> then he is forbidden to try the case because he is considered an interested party, since he will not contradict his own ruling &#x2014; <italic>ShaK, Tummim.</italic> V., Zohar <italic>wa-Yesheb</italic> 179b: &#x2018;Who is regarded as a cunning knave (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05E9;&#x05E2; &#x05E2;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05DD;</span>)? &#x2014; One who pleaded his cause before the Judge before his fellow-litigant arrived (cf. Sot. 21b), as it written, <italic>He that pleadeth his cause first seemeth just</italic> (the litigant who pleads first states every point in his favour and when he is through it looks as if he is right); <italic>but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him out</italic> (Prov. XVIII, 17, i.e., the statements of the second party appear false and the Judge searches him out. Hence, both parties should be heard together). This is forbidden even if one litigant states both his cause and that of his adversary &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh. Zikron Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> writes that if one litigant presented his case before one whom he knows will act as Judge in his case, i.e., the litigant stated: &#x2018;So-and-so has done me violence,&#x2019; &#x2014; the law is that if the Judge does not investigate into the circumstances surrounding the case under which the violence was committed, he is permitted subsequently to act as Judge. <italic>MaHaRIL,</italic> however, implies that even pleading in such a form is forbidden (v. <italic>D.M</italic>.) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn606">22) <italic>MaHaRIL Resp.</italic> 195 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> This means that the Judge is also aware that the other litigant will have to appear before him, in which case the law is that in the first instance he should not hear the cause of the single litigant for perhaps the second litigant will not be satisfied to be tried before him since the Judge had already heard the pleas of his adversary. Furthermore, when the Judge knows that he will act as Judge, the pleas of the litigant who appeared alone will make an impression upon him, which is not the case, however, where the Judge does not know that he will act as Judge, &#x2014; then he is permitted to listen to one litigant alone in which case he may try the case only if he tells the second litigant that he had already heard the pleas of the other party, and the second litigant agrees to appear before him, although he heard the pleas of the first litigant &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> For this may be equated to a case where one agrees to be tried by a relative of the other party or one who is otherwise unfit to judge &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> Moreover, since he was unaware that he would act as Judge in the case, the pleas of the first litigant do not impress themselves upon him &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>

And we say this only where he has not an appointed time with him (to study); but if he has an appointed time with him, we do not care (i.e., if the Judge is his teacher and they have an appointed time to conduct their studies, then the scholar may come prior to the arrival of his opponent), because he (the opponent) will say, He is occupied with his appointment (for study).&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn612">28) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXI, 8. Derived from Mak. 6b: &#x2018;Certain foreigners came (with a lawsuit) before Raba and he appointed an interpreter. How could he act thus? Have we not learnt (in the Mishna a.l. ref. to another interpretation of the words, <italic>At the mouth of two witnesses</italic> [Deut. XVII, 6]) that the Sanhedrin should not hear (the evidence) from the mouth of an interpreter? &#x2014; Raba knew well what they were saying but he did not know how to reply.&#x2019; <italic>Maim.</italic> in Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> explains that the above case (in Mak.) of &#x2018;foreigners&#x2019; refers to litigants (note the expression <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D0;&#x05EA;&#x05D5; &#x05DC;&#x05E7;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05D4; &#x05D3;&#x05E8;&#x05D1;&#x05D0;</span> &#x2018;who came before Raba&#x2019;), i.e., the Judge must not hear the pleas of the <italic>litigants</italic> from the mouth of an interpreter, but it does not refer to the witnesses. However, all the commentators state that the above case refers to witnesses (v. <italic>RaN ibid</italic>.) V., <italic>W.G.</italic> to &#x00A7; 26, 6 <italic>infra</italic> where the same applies to the witnesses and in reality it refers to witnesses too, since Mak. <italic>ibid.</italic> (v. Mishna) speaks of witnesses. The underlying reason for the prohibition against hearing the pleas from the mouth of an interpreter is that when the Judge listens to the claims of the litigants directly, he has first hand information and is in a much better position to clarify the case. If the Judge requires no interpreter even to reply, only that one of the litigants desires to have an interpreter repeat his pleas, it is permissible. So too, if the litigant appointed the interpreter to be his mandatory, it is permissible, for then the interpreter has the status of the litigant. In the case of litigants who speak only a foreign language, it is permissible to have an interpreter, for then it is as though they agreed to be tried under these conditions (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05E7;&#x05D1;&#x05DC;&#x05D5; &#x05E2;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05D4;&#x05DD;</span>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> In monetary cases the prohibition against an interpreter is applicable only in the first instance (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05DB;&#x05EA;&#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;</span>.

The reason being that should the Judge remain silent, then one who overhears this boastful statement will be under the impression that this is the law. The threatening statement was made by the litigant as follows: &#x2018;Were I to desire, I would have made such and such a claim and the law would have been in my favour, but now I do not wish to make this claim against you.&#x2019; Consequently, if the law is not as stated by the litigant, the Judge is obliged to say to him, &#x2018;You are making a false statement, for the law is not as you state.&#x2019; The reason for this requirement is that since the facts mentioned in the litigant&#x2019;s statement do not enter into the fashioning of the final verdict, one who overhears this will say that the litigant is right since the Judge was silent (<italic>Tummim</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>

Or it is quite possible that the reason the claimant does not make the additional claim is due to the fact that he is aware that the defendant has a counter-claim for the surplus or he may have foregone his claim for some other valid reason. However, if the Judge knows that the claimant is a G-d-fearing person, but is unversed in the law, and this being the reason for his not making a larger claim, since he is afraid that he would be robbing the defendant &#x2014; the Judge may say to him, Know you that in accordance with the law you are entitled to more, &#x2014; then if the claimant had foregone his rights or when he owes the defendant the difference, he will state this before the Judge since he is a G-d-fearing person. If the claimant said that he erred in the amount of his claim because he is unversed in the law he is relied upon; or if the Judge himself feels that he has additional rights, he must tell this to the claimant. Otherwise, he must keep his silence, unless the claimant is a G-d-fearing person &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> This interpretation removes many objections raised against <italic>Isserles</italic>&#x2019; ruling by <italic>M.E., ShaK</italic> a.o.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 18: IN WHAT MANNER THE CASE IS DISCUSSED AND [THE LAW OF] FOLLOWING THE MAJORITY. Contains six paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. [If] one of the litigants produced witnesses to [substantiate] his pleas, they bring in the witnesses and receive their testimony properly as will be explained [infra] &#x00A7; 28.<sup><xref rid="fn636">1</xref></sup> And after they receive their testimony they should order every person out<sup><xref rid="fn637">2</xref></sup> and discuss the case. <italic>Some say that it is proper to begin</italic> [<italic>the discussion with the opinion of</italic>] <italic>the minor</italic> [<italic>Judge</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn638">3</xref></sup> If they unanimously agree, it is good; and if not, they follow the majority.<sup><xref rid="fn639">4</xref></sup> [If] two say, &#x2018;He is not guilty,&#x2019; and one says, &#x2018;He is guilty,&#x2019; he is not guilty; [if] two say, &#x2018;He is guilty,&#x2019; and one says, &#x2018;He is not guilty,&#x2019; he is guilty; [if] one says, &#x2018;He is not guilty,&#x2019; and one says, &#x2018;He is guilty,&#x2019; and one says, &#x2018;I know not [how to decide],&#x2019; and even if two state, &#x2018;He is not guilty,&#x2019; or &#x2018;He is guilty,&#x2019; while one says, &#x2018;I know not [how to decide],&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn640">5</xref></sup> they must add<sup><xref rid="fn641">6</xref></sup> two Judges,<sup><xref rid="fn642">7</xref></sup> and consequently, there are five [Judges] who discuss the case.<sup><xref rid="fn643">8</xref></sup> If three declare him not guilty and two declare him guilty, he is not guilty; if three declare him guilty and two declare him not guilty, he is guilty; [if] two say, &#x2018;He is not guilty,&#x2019; and two say, &#x2018;He is guilty,&#x2019; while one states, &#x2018;I know not [how to decide],&#x2019; they must add more Judges.<sup><xref rid="fn644">9</xref></sup> However, [if] four say, &#x2018;He is not guilty,&#x2019; or &#x2018;He is guilty,&#x2019; while one states, &#x2018;I know not [how to decide],&#x2019; or [if] three stated, &#x2018;He is not guilty,&#x2019; and one says, &#x2018;He is guilty,&#x2019; while one states, &#x2018;I know not [how to decide]&#x2019; &#x2014; [the law is that] whether he is the [same] one who stated at the beginning, &#x2018;I know not [how to decide]&#x2019; or whether he is another [Judge], we follow the majority.<sup><xref rid="fn645">10</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Thus seems to me to be the fundamental principle, not as he</italic> [<italic>Caro</italic>] <italic>writes supra &#x00A7; 13, par. 7 the reverse which is the opinion of those differing with</italic> [<italic>this view</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn646">11</xref></sup> <italic>Perhaps, however, he</italic> [<italic>Caro</italic>] <italic>is of the opinion</italic> [<italic>that it is necessary</italic>] <italic>to make a distinction between</italic> [<italic>a case</italic>] <italic>where</italic> [<italic>a Court</italic>] <italic>was selected at the outset</italic> [<italic>consisting of</italic>] <italic>more than three</italic> [<italic>Judges</italic>] <italic>and one</italic> [<italic>where</italic>] <italic>they went down at the outset</italic> [<italic>to hold a judicial session consisting of</italic>] <italic>three</italic> [<italic>Judges</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn647">12</xref></sup> <italic>Yet,</italic> [<italic>this distinction</italic>] <italic>does not seem plausible to me; but they</italic> [<italic>really</italic>] <italic>differ, &#x2014; the first</italic> [<italic>representing</italic>] <italic>the opinion of Maimonides and the second</italic> [<italic>representing</italic>] <italic>the opinion of RaShBA</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn648">13</xref></sup> [<italic>In the case of</italic>] <italic>a community that chose four or five arbiters</italic> [<italic>to decide a case</italic>] <italic>we do not follow the majority</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn649">14</xref></sup> <italic>for</italic> [<italic>the principle of following the</italic>] <italic>majority applies only in a Court of Law</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn650">15</xref></sup> <italic>However, if</italic> [<italic>the members of</italic>] <italic>the community stated that they</italic> [<italic>the arbiters</italic>] <italic>may follow the majority and they are even-balanced, we do not say that others should come and cast the deciding vote, for the</italic> [<italic>members of</italic>] <italic>the community have accepted only those who were</italic> [<italic>originally</italic>] <italic>chosen</italic> [<italic>to decide the case</italic>]. <italic>However, those who were</italic> [<italic>originally</italic>] <italic>chosen may ask whatever advice they desire from others and</italic> [<italic>then</italic>] <italic>render a verdict accordingly</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn651">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. [If] they were half against half and one says, &#x2018;I know not [how to decide],&#x2019; they add two other [Judges]. Likewise, if the matter was [still] in doubt, they continue to increase [the number of Judges] up to the limit of seventy-one. [When the number] seventy-one is reached and thirty-five [members] stated, &#x2018;He is not guilty,&#x2019; and thirty-five [members stated], &#x2018;He is guilty,&#x2019; and one says, &#x2018;I know not [how to decide],&#x2019; they debate with him until he turns to one side with the result that there are thirty-six for acquittal or [thirty-six] for condemnation.<sup><xref rid="fn652">17</xref></sup> But if neither he<sup><xref rid="fn653">18</xref></sup> nor any one of them changed [his viewpoint], &#x2014; [then] the monetary claim is considered doubtful and we let the [disputed] money continue to remain in the possession of its owner.<sup><xref rid="fn654">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. Whosoever states, &#x2018;I know not [how to decide]&#x2019; is not obliged to offer a reason for his statement and to make known on what grounds the [state of] uncertainty was arrived at in the same manner as the one who is for acquittal indicates the grounds for acquittal and the one who is for condemnation [indicates] the grounds for condemnation.<sup><xref rid="fn655">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. Three [Judges] who held a judicial session and one of them withdrew himself [from the case], &#x2014; [the law is that] the two [remaining Judges] cannot conclude the trial.<sup><xref rid="fn656">21</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Likewise, if at the outset more than three</italic> [<italic>Judges</italic>] <italic>were chosen and one</italic> [<italic>of them</italic>] <italic>withdrew as has been explained supra &#x00A7; 13 end</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn657">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. [With respect to] that which we say in the <italic>Gemara</italic>, [viz., that] the teacher and his disciple are counted as one<sup><xref rid="fn658">23</xref></sup> it refers only to the time when [the teacher] instructs him [in] the Law and he [the disciple] relies upon his [the teacher&#x2019;s] instruction,<sup><xref rid="fn659">24</xref></sup> and even in this manner,<sup><xref rid="fn660">25</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] if he is a disciple such as R. Ammi<sup><xref rid="fn661">26</xref></sup> and R. Assi who needed Rab&#x2019;s traditional teaching but needed not his reasoning, he [the teacher] can instruct him [even] during the trial and may [still] pass judgment with him.<sup><xref rid="fn662">27</xref></sup> However, if he does not instruct him during the trial, [then] even if he is his disciple, they are counted as two save that he [the disciple] should have some [capacity for] logical deductions [in order] to understand how to present arguments [in the case]. <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>With regards to ritual law or the laws of uncleanness and cleanness</italic> &#x2014; [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>even if he</italic> [<italic>the disciple</italic>] <italic>requires his logical deductions, they are counted as two</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn663">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. The Court of Law may render decisions in civil cases in the absence of the litigant.<sup><xref rid="fn664">29</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn636">1) <italic>Tur</italic> and Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XII, 9. Derived from San. 30a: &#x2018;(ref. to Mishna <italic>ibid.</italic> 29a: &#x2018;When the Judges arrived at their verdict they brought them in&#x2019;) Whom (do they bring in)? Shall we say the litigants: but they are present there already? (In the Mishna <italic>ibid.</italic> no mention is made that they had to leave)&#x2026; In reality, the litigants are referred to and this accords with the view of R. Ne&#x1E25;emiah (i.e., during the discussion of the case the litigants were ordered out). For it was taught: R. Ne&#x1E25;emiah stated: This was the custom of the pure-minded in Jerusalem: (first) the litigants were brought in and their pleas were heard; (then) the witnesses were brought in and their statements were heard. Then they were ordered out and the case was then discussed.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn637">2) So that the litigants should not know who declared them guilty or not guilty. Furthermore, so that the litigants should not hear the case discussed by the Judges and learn therefrom to advance false pleas &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> However, others who are present there should not be ordered out, especially one who is a distinguished student (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05D3; &#x05D5;&#x05EA;&#x05D9;&#x05E7;</span>) should be permitted to remain. An uncultured disciple should be ordered out (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 9, 6) &#x2014; <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic> and <italic>Beth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> in <italic>Resp. Shebuth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> maintains that according to <italic>Maim., Tur</italic> and <italic>Caro</italic> everyone should be ordered out in accordance with <italic>He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets</italic> (Prov. XI, 13) save a disciple of the law unless he is uncultured may remain &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn638">3) <italic>N.Yos.</italic> to San. IV, &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Derived from San. 36a: (ref. to Mishna <italic>ibid.</italic> 32a: &#x2018;In monetary cases, in cases concerning cleanness and uncleanness [the Judges declare their opinion] beginning with the most distinguished [of the Judges], but in capital cases we begin [with the opinion of] those [that sit] on the side [benches]&#x2019;): &#x2018;Rab said, I was one of the voters in the school of Rabbi and with me they commenced (It was the law concerning a title to property purchased from the <italic>Sikarikon.</italic> V., Git. 59a. Hence, it deals with a monetary case). But have we not learnt, We begin with the most distinguished (of the Judges)? &#x2026; The voting in the school of Rabbi was different because in all their voting they began (with the opinion) of those who sit on the side (on account of Rabbi&#x2019;s humility).&#x2019; Hence, when the Mishna states that we begin the voting with the opinion of the most distinguished it means that we <italic>may</italic> begin with the most distinguished Judge because we do not apprehend that the other Judges will refuse to differ with him; but if they wish to adopt a stringency and begin with the opinion of the minor Judges who sit on the side benches it is a more proper approach, and since this was the procedure adopted in the school of Rabbi, it follows that it is permissible to do so. V., also San. <italic>ibid</italic>.: &#x2018;But in capital cases we begin (with the opinion of those that sit) on the side (benches): Whence do we know this? &#x2014; R. A&#x1E25;a b. Papa stated: Scripture says, <italic>Thou shalt not speak</italic> al rib (in a case) [Ex. XXIII, 2. Rib <span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05D1;</span> is taken as rab <span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05D1;</span>] (i.e.,) you should not speak <italic>al rab</italic> against the most distinguished (of the Judges).&#x2019; This means that it is proper to begin with the side opinion, for if the most distinguished Judge will state his opinion first, the minor Judges will refuse to oppose him and will not have the courage to contradict his opinion. V., however, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> San. <italic>ibid.,</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D9; &#x05E0;&#x05E4;&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span>; <italic>Tosaf. Yom Tob</italic> to San. IV, 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn639">4) V. Ex. XXIII, 2: <italic>To incline after the majority</italic> and cf. Mishna San. 2a. We follow the majority even if the third Judge is much greater in learning than the other two Judges who oppose him provided they are informed of his reasoning and yet oppose him (cf. Yeb. 14a in the case of <italic>Beth Shammai</italic> and <italic>Beth Hillel</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> Although the adopted principle is that &#x2018;we do not follow the majority in monetary disputes&#x2019; (B.K. 27b) &#x2014; this refers only to such cases where the minority is existent; but in the present ruling the minority opinion is regarded as non-existent &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> In monetary matters we follow a majority of one; in capital cases a majority of two &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> V., Mishna San. <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn640">5) Mishna San. 29a. We follow the majority only when all the three Judges discuss the matter and state their opinions; but when one Judge states &#x2018;I know not,&#x2019; he is regarded as non-existent, for were there in his stead another Judge who would state his opinion, it is quite likely that the other two Judges would concur with him. This however, applies only to the first three Judges who discuss the case; but after the number of Judges is increased, &#x2014; then even if one Judge says &#x2018;I know not,&#x2019; nevertheless, since originally when the Court convened their intention was to reach a verdict through three Judges, we follow the majority &#x2014; <italic>M.E. Beth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> in <italic>Resp.</italic> writes that if two of the three Judges declare him to be not guilty and the opinion of the third is that he is guilty, the latter cannot withhold his opinion in order for them to increase the number of Judges because we apprehend that this will bring contempt on the Court (cf. San. 8a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05E6;&#x05D9;&#x05D0;</span>). <italic>Shebuth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> a.o. reject the ruling of <italic>Beth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> and hold that it is permissible for the Judge to say &#x2018;I know not.&#x2019; <italic>Birkath Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> agrees with <italic>Beth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn641">6) Despite the fact that had he declared his opinion he would still have been overruled by the majority, yet since he says, &#x2018;I know not,&#x2019; he is regarded as non-existent, and we require that the case be tried by three Judges &#x2014; <italic>Rashi</italic> to Mishna San. 29a, s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;</span>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn642">7) As in capital cases where two Judges are added. V., Mishna San. 40a; Tosef. San. VI, 4; Tosef(Z). San. VI, 3 and notes. V., Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> VIII, 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn643">8) San. 17a: &#x2018;You might have thought that the one who states, I know not (how to decide) is regarded as an existing member (of the Court) and that whatever he says should be considered. We are therefore taught that he who states, I know not (how to decide) is considered as non-existent and should he offer a reason (for a certain decision) we do not listen to him.&#x2019; Consequently, <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s text following <italic>Maim.</italic> (Yad <italic>ibid</italic>.) presents a difficulty, since it regards the undecided member as existent (note the words of <italic>Caro.</italic> &#x2018;consequently, there are five [Judges] who discuss the case)&#x2019;. For otherwise, after the number of Judges is increased there should be <italic>four</italic> members. It seems, however, that <italic>Maim.</italic> and <italic>Caro</italic> after him maintain that in capital cases only is the undecided member considered as non-existent but not in monetary matters. Cf. San. 33b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D7;&#x05D3;</span>. <italic>Lebush</italic> writes that to add only one Judge would be insufficient, for it is quite likely that the Judge who was at first undecided might change his mind and agree with the opinion of the added Judge and thus there will be an even number of those who are for acquittal and those who are for conviction &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> Cf. also <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 13, 17, n. 34. <italic>Lebush</italic> reason is not accepted by some of the <italic>Codifiers</italic> (v. <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> and cf. <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu</italic> a.l.) and in reality there are instances where one Judge would make the number uneven, e.g., where they originally commenced the legal proceedings with five Judges and one was found to be ineligible, &#x2014; then only one Judge should be added. This explains why the number of Judges added in monetary cases is not mentioned in Mishna San. 29a. But in capital cases where the conviction must be effected by a majority of two, it is mentioned (v. San. 40a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn644">9) Tosef. San. <italic>ibid.</italic> I.e., two more Judges are added. Thus Yad <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn645">10) Likewise if three are for acquittal and two state &#x2018;We know not how to decide,&#x2019; we follow the majority. But if two are for acquittal, one for condemnation and two state &#x2018;We know not how to decide,&#x2019; the number of Judges must be increased since there is no majority against those who are undecided (<italic>RaShaL</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E. Caro</italic> follows <italic>Maim.,</italic> viz., that after the number of Judges is increased, the one who states, &#x2018;I know not how to decide&#x2019; does not invalidate their decision as long as there is a majority of Judges who issue the verdict. Y. San. V, 5 (23a): &#x2018;It was taught: Why are the Judges increased (in civil suits)? &#x2014; So that if two of the first (Judges) were for acquittal (and one said &#x2018;I know not how to decide&#x2019; and they increased the number of the Judges by two) and one of the latter (Judges who were added was also for acquittal and one stated &#x2018;I know not how to decide&#x2019;), &#x2014; (the law is that) the proceedings are completed (i.e., sentence is pronounced) by three (since we now have a majority and we do not say that since one stated &#x2018;I do not know&#x2019; he is considered as nonexistent and consequently we should again increase the number by two. The point is this: At the outset there were only two Judges who concurred and since the verdict is not valid if given by two Judges, the number had to be increased; but now that there are three who agree, sentence is pronounced and it matters not whether one of the added Judges was for condemnation or was undecided). Said R. La (Heb. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05D0;</span> abbrev. of <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05D0;</span>), Since (two Judges have been added) it seems that the final verdict should be pronounced by four (Judges, because the one who was undecided is regarded as non-existent and now that one of the added Judges is also undecided, he too is regarded as non-existent. Consequently we have only three Judges who declare their opinions and therefore the law is that) we do not conclude the proceedings by three (but we should increase the number again by two more Judges). R. Jose said, You may deduce from this (i.e., from the first opinion recorded here, that we issue the verdict by three), (the law stated in Y. Shebi. X, 4(39c)) &#x2014; (that) if three (Judges) confirmed (a document) and one of them dies (before they sign it), the two (Judges) sign it and they must write: Although two of us signed it, we judged (confirmed) it by three (For as in our case we do not require that four Judges offer their opinion, so too, in the case of the document we do not have to add another Judge but it suffices that two Judges sign it. Hence, this is in agreement with the First Tanna and not with R. La). Said R. &#x1E24;aggai, the Mishna (too) states this (v. Shebi. X, 4: &#x2018;This is the formula of a <italic>Prozbul</italic>: I declare before you.....................the Judges, in the place....................., that I shall collect any debt that I may have outstanding with...................., whenever I desire.&#x2019; According to Deut. XV, 2 the Sabbatical year cancels a loan and in order to protect the creditor, a declaration was made in Court to the effect, that the law of limitation by the entrance of the Sabbatical year shall not apply to the loan transacted): The Judges sign below or the witnesses (Thus we see that though the declaration was made before a Court of three, nevertheless, it is valid even if two signed the document of <italic>Prozbul.</italic> Likewise, in the present case where three Judges pronounced the verdict. Hence, we see that this accords with the first opinion <italic>contra</italic> R. La). But do we apply the rules of <italic>Prozbul</italic> to ordinary claims? &#x2014; (Yes), he (R. &#x1E24;aggai) found that it was taught: We apply the rules of <italic>Prozbul</italic> to ordinary claims.&#x2019; It is evident, therefore, that <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s opinion recorded in the present ruling, following Yad <italic>ibid.,</italic> accords with the first opinion in Y. <italic>contra</italic> R. La.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn646">11) V. <italic>infra</italic> par. 4 and notes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn647">12) <italic>Isserles&#x2019;</italic> words are incomprehensible because <italic>RaShBA</italic> states explicitly in a <italic>Resp.</italic> (cited by <italic>Kesef Mishneh</italic> to <italic>San.</italic> VIII, 2) that if one member of a Court of three stated, &#x2018;I know not how to decide,&#x2019; and then two more Judges were added, and subsequently one of the four Judges said, &#x2018;I know not how to decide,&#x2019; &#x2014; the law is that the verdict is given by the three remaining Judges as if the original judicial session was to be conducted by three Judges, and if two of three declare him guilty or not guilty and one opposes them, we follow the two Judges who represent the majority (v. Y. cited <italic>supra</italic> n. 10). On the other hand, v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 13, 7, the source of which is also <italic>RaShBA</italic> which contradicts <italic>Resp.</italic> The difficulty may be removed by making the following distinction: Here we deal with a case where the original session began with three, in which case <italic>RaShBA</italic> agrees that the majority is valid; in &#x00A7; 13, 7 we treat of a case where the original session commenced with ten. Hence, all of them must submit their views, and we follow the majority. Cf. San. 5b. As to <italic>Isserles&#x2019;</italic> statement anon that if the community chose four or five arbiters, we do not follow the majority, it should be borne in mind that there is a difference between choice made by a <italic>community</italic> and that made by <italic>litigants</italic> &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn648">13) <italic>Maim.</italic> holds that in monetary cases the one who is undecided is considered existent. Consequently, in &#x00A7; 13, 7 <italic>supra</italic> according to <italic>Maim.</italic> if one of the ten is undecided, the question may be decided by the majority. However, according to <italic>RaShBA</italic> who maintains that the undecided Judge is considered non-existent even in monetary cases, in agreement with <italic>RaBaD,</italic> it follows that since they agreed to be tried by a Court consisting of ten Judges, consequently there are no ten present &#x2014; <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn649">14) V. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 12, 18, n. 44. The reason being that since they agree to choose more than three, &#x2014; the minimum number required for a <italic>Beth Din,</italic> &#x2014; their decision must therefore be unanimous, and if there is no unanimous agreement, the defendant is exempt until it can be proven otherwise &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>

Should, however, the defendant be guilty in the eyes of strict law, but on the basis of the doubt regarding the communal measure, he claims that he is exempt, &#x2014; the law is that he is placed under the jurisdiction of the law and must pay. A Rabbinical measure found in the Talmud is on the same footing as strict law &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> Cf. however, <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 13, 7.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn652">17) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> VIII, 2. Derived from Mishna San. 40a. V., Tosef(Z). where it is evident that both in monetary and capital cases we adopt the same procedure. Cf. also Y. San. V, 5(23a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn653">18) I.e., the one who is undecided.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn654">19) San. 42a: (Ref. to Mishna <italic>ibid.</italic> 40a: &#x2018;The two sides discuss the case together until one of those who condemn concurs with etc.&#x2019;) &#x2018;What if they do not agree? &#x2014; R. A&#x1E25;a stated: He is discharged.&#x2019; The same applies to a case where one Judge was undecided, and just as this is the law in capital cases, so too, in monetary suits money is not exacted from him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn655">20) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> VIII, 3. Derived from San. 17a: &#x2018;R. Abbahu stated: When the number of Judges is increased, an evenly-balanced Court of Law may be appointed in the first instance. But is this not self-evident (for this has already been mentioned in the Mishna cited <italic>ibid.,</italic> for when the number of the Judges is increased by two when the twenty-third is undecided, the Court consists of an even number)? &#x2014; You might have thought that the one who states, I know not (how to decide) is considered as existent and that we should pay attention to what he says. We are therefore informed that the one who says, I know not (how to decide) is considered as non-existent and if he offers a reason (for a particular verdict, i.e., he advances reasons both for acquittal and conviction and on account of this he is in doubt &#x2014; Thus <italic>Rashi</italic>), we do not pay attention to him.&#x2019; Hence, it follows that since his reasons are not considered should he offer them, consequently, he is not obliged to give reasons for his dubious attitude. Actually, since <italic>Maim.</italic> and <italic>Caro</italic> after him hold that in monetary cases the undecided member is considered existent (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 8) he should be obliged to offer reasons for his dubious attitude, nevertheless, since in capital cases even if he offers reasons for a particular decision, we do not pay any attention to him, it is proper to conclude that in monetary cases he is <italic>not obliged</italic> to offer reasons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn656">21) <italic>Hag. Asheri</italic> to San. I. V., San. 30a (Ref. to Mishna <italic>ibid.</italic> 29a: &#x2018;If two declare him not guilty etc.&#x2019;) &#x2018;How is the verdict phrased? &#x2014; R. Jo&#x1E25;anan said: (The defendant is) not guilty. Resh Lakish said: So-and-so (of the Judges) are for acquittal; So-and-so are for conviction. R. Eleazar said: The defendant has been acquitted by their (the Court&#x2019;s) verdict. Wherein do they differ? &#x2014; Whether he shares in making compensation (in the case of an erroneous decision together with the others [v. San. 6a, 33a]). According to the opinion (that the verdict is to be phrased): He (the defendant) is not guilty, he (the dissenting Judge) must pay his share (because without him the other two could not issue a verdict); while according to the opinion (that the verdict should be worded): So-and-so are for acquittal and So-and-so are for conviction, he must not make payment (because his opinion is contained in the verdict). But even according to the opinion (that the verdict should be phrased): He is not guilty, he (the dissenting Judge) might argue, Had you not accepted my viewpoint, you too would not have to share in making compensation&#x0021; &#x2014; But they differ regarding their liability to pay his share (in addition to their own). On the view (that the verdict is worded thus): He is not guilty, they pay (the entire) liability (since their view was finally adopted); but according to the view: So-and-so (of the Judges) are for acquittal and So-and-so are for conviction, they do not pay (the share of the dissenting Judge). But even on the view (that the wording should be): He is not guilty, why should they pay (the entire amount)? They could argue (with the third Judge): Had you not been with us, the trial would have had no legal consequences at all&#x0021;&#x2019; This latter statement means that they say to him, &#x2018;You should have withdrawn from the case, having noticed that our opinion is erroneous, and consequently we would not have been able to conclude the trial. Hence, by remaining you too, are to blame and must share in the payment. <italic>ShaK</italic> writes that we deal here with a case where the Judges are not aware what the outcome of the trial will be. But if they know what the outcome will be, he may withdraw (i.e., even if the withdrawal is not on account of fear that the litigant who will be pronounced guilty is a powerful individual and will persecute the Judge [v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 12, 1], but simply because he has no time to wait until the trial is concluded &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh</italic>.) and the remaining two Judges conclude the case. <italic>Nethiboth</italic> contends that even the conclusion of the trial (i.e., So-and-so you are guilty etc.) must be made by three Judges.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn657">22) <italic>Caro</italic> places the law of an undecided Judge and that of one who withdraws from the case on an equal footing, viz., that in both cases the law is not decided by the remaining Judges. <italic>Isserles,</italic> however, rules (v. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1) <italic>contra Caro</italic> (<italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 13, 7) and yet in the present case he agrees with him. It is quite likely that the case of &#x2018;one who withdraws&#x2019; is different, for had he been present, he might have advanced a reason for his opinion which would have met with the approval of the other Judges &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Cf. <italic>supra</italic> n. 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn658">23) San. 36a: &#x2018;Rab stated: In capital cases one may teach his disciple (the laws affecting such cases) and pass judgment with him (they count as two votes). They raised an objection: In cases of cleanness and uncleanness, a father and his son or a teacher and his disciple count as two (since the decision may be rendered by one and only in cases of dissension a vote is taken); but in monetary suits, capital cases, cases of flagellation, the sanctification of the month, the intercalation of the year, a father and his son, or a teacher and his disciple count only as one (since a fixed number of Judges is required to deal with such matters)? &#x2014; Rab had reference to (disciples) such as R. Kahana and R. Assi who required Rab&#x2019;s traditional teaching (of the laws) but not his argumentation (in applying these traditions. Consequently, their reasoning is considered independent).&#x2019;</ftnote>

Cf. also B.K. 112b regarding the case of authenticating a document in the absence of the other party to the suit. Hence, once the litigants have put forward their pleas which is similar to the case of authenticating a document, the verdict may be given in the absence of the other party.

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 19: IN WHAT MANNER THE VERDICT IS ISSUED AND THE PROCEDURE [ADOPTED WHEN] PUTTING IT DOWN IN WRITING. Contains three paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. After they [the Judges] discussed the case, the litigants were brought in and the most distinguished<sup><xref rid="fn665">1</xref></sup> of the Judges says, &#x2018;So-and-so, you are not guilty&#x2019; [or] &#x2018;So-and-so, you are guilty&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn666">2</xref></sup> It is forbidden for a Judge to say after leaving the Court of Law, &#x2018;I was for acquittal but my colleagues were in the majority.&#x2019; And the one who acts thus comes under the rule of &#x2018;He that goeth as a talebearer revealeth secrets.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn667">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. [If] one of the litigants requested that they [the Judges] put the verdict in writing for him &#x2014; <italic>in the manner as was explained supra &#x00A7; 14 par. 4</italic><sup><xref rid="fn668">4</xref></sup> &#x2014; they do not mention the name[s] of those who were for acquittal or the name[s] of those who were for conviction,<sup><xref rid="fn669">5</xref></sup> but they write [the verdict] undefinably [thus]: &#x2018;So-and-so appeared with So-and-so, his [fellow-] litigant before the Court of Law and after their [the Judges&#x2019;] decision, So-and-so was found not guilty and So-and-so [was found] guilty.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn670">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. [If] he accepted [to carry out] the verdict and they [the Judges] instructed him to pay, but he left and did not pay,<sup><xref rid="fn671">7</xref></sup> the ban is not pronounced against him until they [first] warn him on Monday, [then] on the Thursday [following] and [again on] Monday, [and if he still defaults] they subsequently pronounce the ban against him until he gives whatever he owes.<sup><xref rid="fn672">8</xref></sup> If he remained [thus] for thirty days and made no claim [to be released from] his ban, they pronounce the <italic>&#x1E24;erem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn673">9</xref></sup> against him.<sup><xref rid="fn674">10</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>If he refuses to accept</italic> [<italic>to carry out</italic>] <italic>the verdict, they pronounce the ban against him forthwith</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn675">11</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn665">1) The reason why the senior Judge makes this pronouncement is in order that the litigant who was declared guilty should not suspect who was for acquittal or who was for conviction &#x2014; <italic>M.E.. Tosaf. Yom Tob</italic> to San, III, 7 writes that the reason is simply to accord honour to the senior Judge because it is not permissible to speak before one who is greater in wisdom.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn666">2) Mishna San. 29a. Should the guilty party summon him again before another Court of Law, the latter is not obliged to go to law with him because of the principle &#x2018;One Court of Law is not careful in its examination of a case already tried by another Court of Law.&#x2019; Cf. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 14, n. 4. Nor is the Court of Law permitted to listen to his pleas &#x2014; <italic>D.M.</italic> on the authority of <italic>Resp.</italic> in <italic>&#x1E24;aze ha-Tenufah.</italic> And even if the disciples noticed that the verdict is incorrect, they are not permitted to tear up the document, but must wait until the Master himself examines the matter &#x2014; <italic>R. Yeru&#x1E25;am.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn667">3) Prov. XI, 13. Thus Mishna San. <italic>ibid.</italic> One who is not a Judge is forbidden to say to a litigant who was convicted that the Judge erred in their decision, for one who says this transgresses <italic>He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets</italic> and <italic>From a false matter keep thee far</italic> and is the cause of enmity and dissension &#x2014; <italic>SeMaG.</italic> V., <italic>K.H., Tummim</italic> and <italic>P.Tesh</italic> for further elucidation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn668">4) It is not clear why <italic>Isserles</italic> makes reference to <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 14, for there we deal with a case where one of the litigants requested a written document containing the grounds on which the verdict was issued in order to appeal the case before the Supreme Court; whereas in the present ruling it seems that we deal with a verdict that is usually kept in Court as a permanent record in which case the verdict is worded, &#x2018;So-and-so is obliged to pay So-and-so etc.&#x2019; It may, however, be possible that <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 14 the verdict is worded <italic>and after their decision etc.,</italic> so that it should not become known who among the Judges was for conviction in the event that the Supreme Court upsets the verdict, and similarly in the present ruling we deal with such a case. Note the expression employed here &#x2018;(If) &#x2026; <italic>requested</italic>.&#x2019; V., however, San. 31a whence it appears that every type of verdict is phrased <italic>and after their decision etc.</italic> The matter, therefore requires further study &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn669">5) If all the Judges reach a unanimous decision, the verdict is worded thus: <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> appeared for trial. So-and-so was found guilty and So-and-so was found not guilty. Otherwise the verdict is phrased as found in the present ruling. All the Judges, even the dissentient must sign the verdict. V., Y. San. III, 11(21d).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn670">6) San. 30a in accord with R. Eleazar. Thus also Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXII, 8 and <italic>Asheri.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn671">7) Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> XXV, 11 and <italic>Tur.</italic> Derived from M.K. 16a in accord with R. &#x1E24;isda: &#x2018;What is meant by <italic>Hardafah?</italic> &#x2014; Said R. Judah b. R. Samuel b. Shelath on the authority of Rab: It denotes: They place him under the ban forthwith. (If he remains obstinate) they repeat (the same proclamation of the ban) after thirty days (the period of <italic>Niddui,</italic> i.e., separation) and then they proclaim the <italic>&#x1E24;erem</italic> against him after sixty days. Said R. Huna b. &#x1E24;inena, Thus said R. &#x1E24;isda: They (first) warn him on Monday (then on the Thursday (following) and (again on) the Monday (the Court of Law held judicial sessions on Mondays and Thursdays. V., B.K. 82a). This rule has reference to a case where he disobeys a monetary judgment; but in a case of contempt of Court, the ban is pronounced forthwith.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn672">8) M.K. <italic>ibid.</italic> in accord with R. &#x1E24;isda. V., previous note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn673">9) On the terms <italic>Niddui</italic> <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05D9;</span> and <italic>&#x1E24;erem</italic> <span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05E8;&#x05DD;</span>, v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 11, n. 9; Y.D. &#x00A7; 334.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 20: UNTIL WHEN CAN ONE PRODUCE EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO UPSET THE VERDICT. Contains one paragraph.</title>

Huna also said: The law does not follow the Sages. But is this not self-evident; since he states that the law follows Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel it automatically follows that the law does not rest with the Sages? &#x2014; What you might have said is that his statement (that the law follows Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel) applies only at the outset (i.e., even if evidence was produced after the thirty days it should be accepted); but <italic>ex post facto</italic> (i.e., where his proof was rejected by the Court and a decision was given accordingly) it holds good: we are therefore informed by the second statement, (viz., that the law does not follow the Sages) that even then (the verdict) is upset.&#x2019; According to the interpretation of <italic>R. Zera&#x1E25;iah ha-Lewi,</italic> this latter statement &#x2018;but <italic>ex post facto</italic> etc.,&#x2019; should be understood as referring to a case where money had already been exacted from one party, and we might have thought that in this case the law should rest with the Sages and the verdict should not be upset, we are therefore informed otherwise.

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 21: ONE WHO AGREED TO CARRY OUT THE VERDICT ON A CERTAIN DAY AND MET WITH AN UNAVOIDABLE INTERFERENCE. Contains one paragraph.</title>
<p>1. One with whom a formal agreement was made by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> that if he fails to appear [in Court] on a certain date and take an oath, [then] his fellow [-litigant] will be regarded as trustworthy in his pleas and will collect everything that he claims without an oath, or [he stipulates] that if he fails to appear on a certain date and take an oath and [thereby] collect [his claim], he forfeits his rights and will have nothing and his fellow [-litigant] will be exempt<sup><xref rid="fn699">1</xref></sup> [from making payment], &#x2014; and [then] the [stipulated Court] day passed and he failed to appear, &#x2014; [the law is that] the conditions become effective<sup><xref rid="fn700">2</xref></sup> and he forfeits his rights<sup><xref rid="fn701">3</xref></sup> <italic>forthwith</italic><sup><xref rid="fn702">4</xref></sup> <italic>and they do not grant him an extension of time</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn703">5</xref></sup> However, if he produced proof that he was unavoidably prevented [to appear] on that date,<sup><xref rid="fn704">6</xref></sup> he is free from [the obligation] of this formal agreement by <italic>Kinyan</italic><sup><xref rid="fn705">7</xref></sup> and he may [subsequently] take an oath when his fellow [-litigant] summons him again<sup><xref rid="fn706">8</xref></sup> as in the first instance. And thus too, everything that is similar to this [case]. <italic>And this entire</italic> [<italic>ruling is applicable only</italic>] <italic>where a formal agreement was made with him by means of a Kinyan</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn707">9</xref></sup> <italic>but not otherwise, for</italic> [<italic>then</italic>] <italic>this would be a mere Asmakta</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn708">10</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn699">1) The present ruling is in the order of an anticlimax, for after having stated the law that if one does not fulfil his condition, though a formal agreement was made by means of a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> the other party has a right to collect his claim, then it applies even more to the following case where if the condition is not fulfilled, the fellow-litigant is exempt. Or it is quite likely that both these rulings have to be mentioned because in the former case a <italic>Kinyan</italic> has to be effected at an authoritative Court of Law, but not in the latter case &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn700">2) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> VII, 10 and <italic>Tur.</italic> Thus also <italic>SeMaG</italic> on the authority of the <italic>Geonim.</italic> V., also <italic>Hag. Maim.</italic> to Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> Derived from Y.Kid. III, 2(63d): (Ref. to Mishna <italic>ibid.</italic> regarding one who betrothed a woman on a condition): &#x2018;If he met with an unavoidable interference (and could not fulfil his condition of betrothal), &#x2014; R. Jo&#x1E25;anan stated, (With respect to) an unavoidable interference it is as though he did not act (and consequently in the case of betrothal a plea of unavoidable interference is invalid <italic>contra</italic> divorce where such a plea would be accepted, the reason being that in the case of divorce the matter depends wholly on the husband&#x2019;s consent; whereas in betrothal her consent is also required. Thus <italic>Korban &#x2018;Edah</italic>). R. Simeon b. Lakish stated, (With respect to) an unavoidable interference it is as though he acted (and therefore the plea of &#x2018;unavoidable interference&#x2019; is applicable to betrothal as well as divorce. Thus <italic>Korban &#x2018;Edah</italic>).&#x2019; The <italic>Halachah rests</italic> with R. Jo&#x1E25;anan. But as we have seen from the above text of Y., according to R. Jo&#x1E25;anan a plea of &#x2018;unavoidable interference&#x2019; is invalid. Hence, it would follow that in our present ruling he should not be free from the obligation effected by the <italic>Kinyan</italic> even if he was unavoidably prevented to appear. <italic>Ba&#x1E24;,</italic> therefore, suggests that the text of Y. should be emended thus: Instead of &#x2018;R. Jo&#x1E25;anan stated &#x2026; it is as though he did <italic>not act&#x2019;</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05D0; &#x05E2;&#x05D1;&#x05D3;</span>), we should read &#x2018;it is as though he <italic>did not violate</italic> (the condition)&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05D0; &#x05E2;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;</span>). V., <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu</italic> who does not consider this emendation as plausible and maintains that the source of this ruling is Ned. 27b q.v. anon The following sources should be examined in order to clarify the present ruling: Tosef. B.M. I, 9: &#x2018;If both parties to a lawsuit are stubborn, and one said to the other, If I will not appear (for trial) between now and a certain date, (then) such and such an amount which is in my possession will become yours, &#x2014; (the law is that) if the time is up (and he did not appear), the condition must be fulfilled. Thus R. Jose. Said R. Judah, How can he take possession of aught that is not his, but he must seize it.&#x2019; The same controversy is found in B.B. 168a: Mishna: &#x2018;If a man paid part of his debt and the bond was placed with a third party to whom (the debtor said), If I have not paid you (the balance) by such a date, then give him (the creditor) his bond, (and) the date arrived and he did not pay, R. Jose says, He (the trustee) should give it (to him); R. Judah says, He should not give it (to him).&#x2019; Gemara: &#x2018;On what principle does their difference of opinion rest? &#x2014; R. Jose holds that <italic>Asmakta</italic> (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 12, nn. 45-46) gives one a valid title; whereas R. Judah maintains that <italic>Asmakta</italic> gives no title. R. Na&#x1E25;man on the authority of Rabbah b. Abbahu on the authority of Rab Said: The law rests with R. Jose. When (cases of <italic>Asmakta</italic>) came before R. Ammi, he stated: Since R. Jo&#x1E25;anan has taught us time and again that the law follows R. Jose, what can I do? The law, however, does not rest with R. Jose.&#x2019; V., <italic>Tosaf</italic>. s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05DE;&#x05E8; &#x05E8;&#x05D1; &#x05E0;&#x05D7;&#x05DE;&#x05DF;</span>. Ned. 27b: &#x2018;The law is that <italic>Asmakta</italic> gives one a legal title, provided he did not meet with an unavoidable interference, and a formal agreement by <italic>Kinyan</italic> was effected at an authoritative Court of Law (an ordained <italic>Beth Din.</italic> Thus <italic>Rashi</italic> and <italic>Maim. RaN</italic>: A <italic>Beth Din</italic> that has the authority to enforce its decisions).&#x2019; V., also <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 55, 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn701">3) This refers to both cases &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> V., <italic>supra</italic> n. 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn702">4) Ned. 27b: &#x2018;A man once deposited his rights at the Court of Law, and stated: If I do not appear within thirty days, these rights will be void. Subsequently he was prevented from appearing by an unavoidable interference. R. Huna ruled: His rights are void.&#x2019; This means forthwith. Cf. also B.B. <italic>ibid.</italic> &#x2014; <italic>RaShBaM.</italic> Cf. <italic>supra</italic> n. 1 on the final law regarding an unavoidable interference.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn703">5) <italic>B.Yos.</italic> to &#x00A7; 19 on the authority of <italic>RaShBA</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> I.e., if he requests an extension of time to take his oath, we do not grant him this. However, if he demands an extension of time to make payment, his request is granted (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 100) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn704">6) If he was unavoidably prevented from fulfilling his condition only on the last day, v. Y.D. &#x00A7; 232, 12, <italic>Gloss</italic> where two opinions are mentioned concerning this type of unavoidable interference. According to Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> even if he was unavoidably prevented on the last day only, it is considered valid. He must also clarify the unavoidable interference, but if he has no proof, then even if he is the possessor, it is considered possession in error, and he cannot put forward the plea of &#x2018;the claimant must produce evidence&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05E6;&#x05D9;&#x05D0; &#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05D5; &#x05E2;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05D5; &#x05D4;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05D4;</span>) &#x2014; <italic>Tummim.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn705">7) And it is as though no formal agreement by means of <italic>Kinyan</italic> was ever effected. And even though he is no longer unavoidably prevented and did not appear forthwith, he may take his oath whenever he so desires &#x2014; <italic>Tummim.</italic></ftnote>

One [of the litigants] who accepted a relative<sup><xref rid="fn709">1</xref></sup> or an [otherwise] ineligible person<sup><xref rid="fn710">2</xref></sup> to act as a Judge<sup><xref rid="fn711">3</xref></sup> or a witness<sup><xref rid="fn712">4</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>the acceptance is regarded</italic> [<italic>valid</italic>] <italic>only when</italic> [<italic>the litigant</italic>] <italic>accepted him to act as Judge; but if he deposited money with him regarding which they were in dispute, it is not designated</italic> [<italic>valid</italic>] <italic>acceptance</italic><sup><xref rid="fn713">5</xref></sup> &#x2014; even if he accepted one of those ineligible on account of sin as [equivalent to] two eligible witnesses to testify on his behalf or [he accepted him] as three of a Court of Law [of] authoritative [Judges] to adjudicate [the case] for him.<sup><xref rid="fn714">6</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>:<sup><xref rid="fn715">7</xref></sup> <italic>Some differ</italic> [<italic>with this ruling</italic>] <italic>and are of the opinion that</italic> [<italic>this is applicable</italic>] <italic>only if he accepted a relative or an</italic> [<italic>otherwise</italic>] <italic>ineligible person as one Judge or as one witness; but if he accepted him as two</italic> [<italic>witnesses or as three authoritative Judges</italic>] <italic>in which case there are two irregularities &#x2014;</italic> [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>even after the legal proceedings are closed, he may retract</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn716">8</xref></sup> <italic>Thus is the common consent of the majority of the Codifiers</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn717">9</xref></sup> <italic>However, if they made a formal agreement with him by means of a Kinyan, in nowise may he retract</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn718">10</xref></sup> Whether he accepted to forfeit his rights and to remit whatever he claimed in accordance with their verdict or he accepted to pay whatever claim his fellow [-litigant] will make against him according to the evidence of this ineligible person or according to his legal decision<sup><xref rid="fn719">11</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] if they made a formal agreement with him by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> relative to this [matter], he cannot retract; but if they did not make a formal agreement with him by means of a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> he can retract before the legal proceedings are closed.<sup><xref rid="fn720">12</xref></sup> <italic>Supra &#x00A7; 12, 2 it has been explained what is considered the close of legal proceedings</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn721">13</xref></sup> <italic>And as to the matter of evidence,</italic> &#x2014; [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>as soon as</italic> [<italic>the witnesses</italic>] <italic>have testified, he cannot retract</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn722">14</xref></sup> [As soon as] the legal proceedings are closed, he cannot retract<sup><xref rid="fn723">15</xref></sup> provided it did not become known that [the Judges] erred [in their decision].<sup><xref rid="fn724">16</xref></sup> <italic>However, if they are</italic> [<italic>the</italic>] <italic>duly appointed</italic> [<italic>Judges</italic>] <italic>in the city or the representatives of the town, he cannot retract</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn725">17</xref></sup> <italic>for thus is the adopted practice</italic> [<italic>viz.,</italic>] <italic>that whatever a person accepts before the heads of the town, he cannot retract</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn726">18</xref></sup> If [the litigant] denies [this] and states, &#x2018;I did not accept [him] to act as Judge,&#x2019; and there are no witnesses [to confirm this] statement, he must take an oath that he did not accept him [as Judge] even if the Judge contradicts him and stated that he [the litigant] did accept him.<sup><xref rid="fn727">19</xref></sup> [<italic>In the case of</italic>] <italic>a public that has recognized unlearned Judges as authorities over them, the litigants cannot prevent</italic> [<italic>them from trying their case</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn728">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. If he accepted the testimony of a heathen it is as though he accepted the testimony of one of the ineligible persons.<sup><xref rid="fn729">21</xref></sup> However, if he accepted the heathen as a Judge, [then] even if they made an agreement with him [the litigant] by means of a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> the agreement has no legal consequences, and it is forbidden to be tried before him.<sup><xref rid="fn730">22</xref></sup> <italic>But if he had already been tried before him, he cannot retract</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn731">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. One who was under obligation to his fellow to take an oath in Court and [the latter] said, &#x2018;Swear to me by the life of your head and be exempt,&#x2019; or &#x2018;Swear to me by the life of your head and I will pay you whatever you claim,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn732">24</xref></sup> &#x2014; [then] if they made a formal agreement with him by means of a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> he cannot retract; and if they did not make a formal agreement with him by means of a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> he can retract until the legal proceedings are closed.<sup><xref rid="fn733">25</xref></sup> Once the legal proceedings are closed and he took the oath<sup><xref rid="fn734">26</xref></sup> as stated to him [by his fellow-litigant], he cannot retract and is obliged to make payment. Likewise one who was under obligation to take an equitable oath<sup><xref rid="fn735">27</xref></sup> and transferred it [the oath] to his opponent,<sup><xref rid="fn736">28</xref></sup> &#x2014; [then] if they made a formal agreement with him by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> or if the party to whom it was transferred took the oath, he cannot retract. So too, one who was not obliged to take an oath and stated, &#x2018;I will take an oath,&#x2019; &#x2014; [then] if they made a formal agreement with him by means of a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> he cannot retract; and if they did not make a formal agreement with him by means of a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> although he accepted in [the presence of] the Court [to take the oath], he may retract until the legal proceedings are closed and [only thereafter] he must take the oath. <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>One who is under obligation to take an oath and stated before the Court of Law, &#x2018;I desire not to take an oath, I am prepared to make payment,&#x2019; and</italic> [<italic>then</italic>] <italic>left the Court of Law, &#x2014;</italic> [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>he cannot retract for this is regarded the close of his legal proceedings</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn737">29</xref></sup> <italic>Some</italic> [<italic>authorities</italic>], <italic>however, differ</italic> [<italic>with this view</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn738">30</xref></sup> <italic>One who was under obligation to his fellow to take a Biblical oath and he said to the latter, &#x2018;Take an oath and collect,&#x2019; and</italic> [<italic>then the latter hurriedly</italic>] <italic>took an oath without holding a</italic> [<italic>sacred</italic>] <italic>object,</italic> &#x2014; [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>he</italic> [<italic>the defendant</italic>] <italic>cannot retract</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn739">31</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn709">1) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> VII, 2. Derived from Mishna San. 24a: &#x2018;If one (of the litigants) said to the other, I accept my father as trustworthy,&#x2019; or &#x2018;I accept your father as trustworthy,&#x2019; or &#x2018;I accept three oxherds as trustworthy.&#x2019; R. Meir says, He may (subsequently) retract; but the Sages maintain, He cannot retract.&#x2019; By stating &#x2018;father&#x2019; we derive that accepting a relative is valid.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn710">2) Mishna <italic>ibid.</italic>: &#x2018;I accept three oxherds as trustworthy,&#x2019; whence we derive the law of accepting an ineligible person. For an oxherd is ineligible to judge or to testify &#x2014; v. San. 25b: &#x2018;Raba stated: The oxherds to whom (the Sages) have made reference include the oxherds of both large and small cattle.&#x2019; Therefore, we are informed that if they were accepted by the litigants, it is valid. V., also <italic>ibid.</italic> 24b: &#x2018;Raba stated: If one accepted a relative or an (otherwise) ineligible person (to act as Judge or witness), he may retract before the conclusion of the trial, but not afterwards.&#x2019; Gemara concludes that Raba&#x2019;s statement agrees with R. Jo&#x1E25;anan according to the view of the Sages in the Mishna.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn711">3) San. 25b: &#x2018;For we learnt: (If one says), I accept three oxherds as trustworthy (they are acceptable [which means that otherwise they are ineligible]). Does this not (mean that ordinarily they are ineligible) for witnesses? &#x2014; No, for Judges. This is also apparent from the expression <italic>three oxherds;</italic> for if it means eligible as witnesses, why three?&#x2019; Hence, if they were accepted, it is valid and according to the Sages, he may not retract.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn712">4) San. 23b whence it is derived that acceptance of an otherwise ineligible person to act as witness is on the same par as accepting him to judge. The entire Mishna in San. 24a deals with a case where the acceptance took place before a Court of three eligible Judges (v. Y. San. III, 5(21a)). For if outside of the Court and there was no formal agreement made by <italic>Kinyan,</italic> the law is that even after the conclusion of the trial, he may retract according to all the authorities &#x2014; <italic>Hag. Asheri</italic> on the authority of <italic>O</italic>.Z. <italic>N.Yos.</italic> and <italic>R. Yeru&#x1E25;am</italic> (to B.B. VIII) on the other hand, maintain that the relatives or otherwise ineligible persons were not accepted before a Court; but if their acceptance was before a Court, then even before the conclusion of the trial, he may not retract &#x2014; <italic>ShaK. Tummim</italic> writes that actually there is no difference whether they were accepted before a Court of Law or not. For once the pleas are presented before them they enjoy the status of a Court and it is regarded as if the acceptance took place before a Court of Law. The acceptance of a relative is valid only where the litigant knew that this was his relative, but if he pleads that he was unaware that he was his relative, the law is that he must take an equitable oath (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 1, n. 2) and may retract (<italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic>). However, if the litigant used to visit him and now he states that he was unaware that he is his relative, he is not regarded trustworthy (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 36, 2). Where the litigant claims that he was unaware that the accepted person was ineligible, the following distinction should be borne in mind: If the person is Rabbinically ineligible, in which case a public announcement is usually made in Court proclaiming him as such &#x2014; then the litigant is not believed (v. <italic>ShaK infra</italic> &#x00A7; 71, n. 31) because all judicial matters are publicized; whereas in the case of an ineligible person who does not require a public announcement proclaiming him as such &#x2014; the litigant is regarded trustworthy &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> If the relative reveals that he is obliged to help and support the litigant, the latter&#x2019;s acceptance of him is invalid (<italic>Keneseth ha-Gedolah</italic>). <italic>Shebuth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> reports a case concerning a woman who left instructions prior to her death that if any dissension will arise between her sons, a certain relative of hers should adjudicate their case, and the sons obligated themselves by means of &#x2018;striking hands&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05E2;&#x05EA; &#x05DB;&#x05E3;</span>) to follow the decision of that relative, and now one of the sons refuses to be tried before him, claiming a) that the latter is an illiterate person who is incompetent to adjudicate such matters, or at least others should be co-opted forming a <italic>Beth Din;</italic> b) that this person is more favourably disposed to one of the other brothers. <italic>Resp.</italic>: The law is that regarding the Talmudic principle &#x2018;It is a religious duty to carry out the instructions of a dying person&#x2019; (Ket. 68b-70a; Git. 14b, 15a, 40a), it would not be applicable in this case (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 252, 2; Y.D. &#x00A7; 232, 17, <italic>Gloss</italic>); but as far as the obligation effected through &#x2018;striking hands,&#x2019; the instructions must be carried out, and as to a) he knew about this at the outset and yet accepted him; b) every vow, the release of which, brings in its wake the &#x2018;least suspicion of sin&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05D3;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05D3; &#x05E2;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;&#x05D4;</span>), should not be annulled (v. Y.D. &#x00A7; 230, <italic>Gloss</italic>). Hence, in the present case there is still a &#x2018;suspicion of sin&#x2019; against his mother because he should carry out the instructions of his mother, albeit in the category of &#x2018;fulfilling his duty beyond the requirements of the law,&#x2019; although strictly speaking this is not applicable in the present case &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn713">5) <italic>RIBaSh</italic> s. 311 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> This refers to a case where one took an oath to pay his fellow on a certain date, and when the time for payment arrived, he deposited the money with the town Judge in order to fulfil his obligation effected through the oath, and instructed the Judge not to deliver the money to the other party because he had a claim against him and the Judge was related to him. Consequently, since the litigant did not accept the Judge explicitly, the acceptance is not valid and the judgment has no legal consequences &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn714">6) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> VII, 2. Derived from San. 24a (ref. to Mishna <italic>ibid</italic>.): &#x2018;R. Dimi b. R. Na&#x1E25;man b. R. Joseph stated: (The Mishna has reference to a case) e.g., where he (the litigant) accepted him (i.e., one of those mentioned) as one (of the three Judges).&#x2019; According to <italic>Rashi</italic> this refers to R. Meir&#x2019;s viewpoint and it means that even if there are two other eligible Judges, R. Meir maintains that he may retract, whence it follows that according to the Sages, both if he accepted him as one of the Judges or as three, he cannot retract. &#x2018;An ineligible person&#x2019; is mentioned here in order to introduce a remarkable feature, viz., that even one who is disqualified to offer testimony in any other case. Much more so in the case of a &#x2018;father,&#x2019; who is eligible to offer testimony in other cases, is the acceptance considered valid where the latter was accepted as two witnesses or three Judges &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn715">7) This <italic>Gloss</italic> should come after &#x2018;he can &#x2026; legal proceedings are closed&#x2019; anon &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn716">8) Thus <italic>Alfasi</italic> to San. III <italic>contra Gaon</italic> who maintains that even if a formal <italic>Kinyan</italic> was made before a <italic>Beth Din,</italic> he may retract, since it was a <italic>Kinyan</italic> made in error. Cf. Sheb. 42a: &#x2018;A certain (man) said to his fellow: You are believed by me like two whenever you claim that I have not paid you. He went and paid him before three. Said R. Papa: He believed him like two but like three he did not believe him. To this R. Huna b. R. Joshua objected: Two are like a hundred and a hundred are like two&#x0021; But if he said to him: Like three, and he went and paid him before four (witnesses, the lender is not believed), for since he cares to mention a certain number of opinions (that he believes him like three people) he means (exclusively) that number of opinions (for otherwise he would have mentioned only <italic>two</italic> who are equivalent to any number).&#x2019; There must have been a formal <italic>Kinyan</italic> made, for if the statement of credence was made at the time the loan was transacted it is equivalent to <italic>Kinyan;</italic> otherwise formal <italic>Kinyan</italic> is required. We thus see that as far as two are concerned the lender is believed according to all opinions, although there were two irregularities (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E8;&#x05EA;&#x05D9; &#x05DC;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05E2;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;&#x05D0;</span>), a) he believed the lender himself; b) he considered him as two witnesses. Likewise in the present ruling there are two irregularities, a) one Judge was accepted like three; b) even he was Biblically ineligible. Hence even in the case of two irregularities, once a <italic>Kinyan</italic> was made he may not retract on the principle &#x2018;nothing else is required after Kinyan is effected&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05DC;&#x05D0;&#x05D7;&#x05E8; &#x05E7;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05DB;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;&#x05DD;</span>). Should he, however, appoint another Court to deal with the case, the latter must adjudicate the case in accordance with the pleas and admissions presented before the first Court (provided there was a formal <italic>Kinyan</italic> made. Thus <italic>Nethiboth</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> on the authority of <italic>RaShBA Resp.</italic> If he accepted one eligible Judge like three experts (<italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic>) or one eligible witness like two and the trial was concluded he may not retract (since there is only one irregularity) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> and later authorities <italic>contra ShaK.</italic> V., <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> Likewise, if he accepted three ineligible persons (simultaneously. V., <italic>P.Tesh</italic>) like three eligible ones, he may not retract, since there is only one irregularity &#x2014; <italic>Tummim.</italic> V., however, <italic>K.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn717">9) In accord with San. 23b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D0;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;</span> who point out that R. Dimi&#x2019;s statement (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 6) refers to the view held by the Sages, viz., that he may not retract; but if he accepted one as the equivalent of a complete Court, even the Sages will agree that he may subsequently retract on account of two irregularities involved. <italic>ShaK,</italic> however, cites many authorities who accept the first opinion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn718">10) I.e., even if they accepted one witness as two &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Thus <italic>Alfasi.</italic> Derived from Sheb. 42a. V., <italic>supra</italic> n. 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn719">11) San. 24b: &#x2018;R. Na&#x1E25;man b. R. &#x1E24;isda sent a query to R. Na&#x1E25;man b. Jacob: Will our Master kindly teach us, Is the difference of opinion (between R. Meir and the Sages) before or after the verdict (is given), and with whom does the law accord? &#x2014; He sent back word: The difference of opinion has reference to the close of legal proceedings (i.e., after the verdict is given) and the law rests with the Sages. R. Ashi stated: This was the query he sent: Do they differ in a case where (the defendant says) <italic>I will pay your claim,</italic> (if such is the verdict), or with regards to (a case where the plaintiff says) <italic>Let my claim against you be remitted</italic> (should this be the final verdict. The point is this: In the former case money will be transferred from one party to another, and consequently more power must be exercised; in the latter case, less authority is required, since the possessor has a presumption of ownership) and with whom does the law accord? &#x2014; He replied: The controversy is with reference to <italic>I will pay you</italic> and the law accords with the Sages.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn720">12) San. 24b: &#x2018;A message was dispatched from the School of Rab to Samuel as follows: Will our Master kindly teach us, (If one of the parties) made a formal agreement by <italic>Kinyan</italic> (not to retract), what (if he desires to retract) before the verdict is given? &#x2014; He sent back word: After a formal agreement is made by means of <italic>Kinyan,</italic> nothing (can be done to retract from the pledge).&#x2019; Although this (i.e., not to retract) appears to be &#x2018;a mere verbal agreement&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05D3;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>), i.e., that of which ownership is acquired by means of the <italic>Kinyan</italic> is only a verbal promise, and does not involve any concrete article, &#x2014; yet, we do find that the <italic>Kinyan</italic> binds him in his undertaking (v. B.M. 67b; B.B. 3a; <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 12, n. 31). Thus <italic>N.Yos. RaBaN</italic> maintains that the <italic>Kinyan</italic> is binding only when the litigant pledges himself to follow the verdict of the Court or to accept the evidence of the witnesses &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn721">13) I.e., when the pronouncement is made: &#x2018;So-and-so, you are guilty&#x2019; or &#x2018;So-and-so, you are not guilty,&#x2019; and much more so when they say to him &#x2018;Go and pay him&#x2019; which indicates that a definitive decision has been reached. Not so, however, when they say to him, &#x2018;You are obliged to pay him,&#x2019; for such a statement is indicative that they are still in doubt &#x2014; <italic>M.E. ShaK</italic> adds that the legal proceedings are also considered closed when the litigants leave Court.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn723">15) San. 24b. V., <italic>supra</italic> n. 11. Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> VII, 2 has &#x2018;Once the legal proceedings are closed <italic>and</italic> money was exacted through the verdict of this ineligible person or through his testimony, he may not retract.&#x2019; <italic>Kes. Mishneh</italic> explains that it does not necessarily mean that money had been exacted, but that since the legal proceedings are closed it is as though money had been exacted. The litigants are not permitted to retract even if they both agree, the reason being that out of deference to the Judge, the verdict must stand unless the litigants wish to make a complete remission to each other &#x2014; <italic>B.Yos.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn724">16) San. 6a: &#x2018;R. Abbahu stated: All concur that a decision given by two (Judges) in civil cases is not valid. R. Abba raised an objection (from the following): If one adjudicated a case by himself and pronounced the guilty, not guilty, and the not guilty, guilty, or the unclean, clean, his act cannot be upset, but he (the Judge) has to pay from his own pocket (This clearly shows that the decision of one Judge also stands)? &#x2014; We deal here with a case where the litigants accepted the Judge. If so, why should the Judge) pay indemnity? &#x2014; Because they (the litigants) said to him: Adjudicate the case for us in accordance with the law of the Torah.&#x2019; The Talmud (<italic>ibid.</italic>) concludes that if the Judge erred in his decision by overlooking a law stated in the Mishna, he may revoke his decision; but if he made a mistake in deciding against common pratice, his act cannot be undone and he must pay from his own pocket. It is thus evident that whenever the litigants accept the Judge, even if he is ineligible, then even if a <italic>Kinyan</italic> was effected, it is only on condition that no error should be made. Otherwise they may retract. Cf. Git. 14a: &#x2018;R. Na&#x1E25;man said, If a formal agreement by means of <italic>Kinyan</italic> was effected in error, the money must be returned.&#x2019; In a case where the Judges erred in their decision and the litigant is then permitted to retract, he is allowed to present his case anew and even alter his original pleas. Furthermore, the second Court of Law gives the litigant a new extension of time to produce his proofs or other required evidence. If the litigants accepted the Judges to adjudicate their case in accordance with strict law, and they (the Judges) made a settlement through arbitration, this too, is considered an error in judgment and even if the litigants bound themselves by a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> they may retract &#x2014; <italic>M.E., ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn725">17) For in such a case it was known that the Judges are incompetent, and consequently, when they were accepted by the litigants, it meant that their decision would be followed even if it were erroneous since they are the representatives of the town. V., <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 25. In this case even if the litigants accepted them to Judge in accordance with the law of the Torah and the latter instead made a settlement by arbitration, their decision is still binding &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> If the Judges were accepted before the representatives of the town (even three of the representatives. Not necessarily the entire seven) even <italic>Kinyan</italic> is not required (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 163 end) &#x2014; <italic>M.E., ShaK.</italic> Hence, even before the conclusion of the trial, one may not retract. Not so, however, if the acceptance took place before three Judges who are not the town representatives.

ShaK</italic> (followed by <italic>W.G.</italic>) rejects the latter reason and maintains that this is certainly regarded as a denial of a monetary claim. Hence, where the Judge is eligible, the litigant would have to take a Biblical oath. <italic>Nethiboth</italic> writes that we consider the litigant&#x2019;s statement a denial of a monetary claim only after he was pronounced guilty by the Judge; but if he was not yet pronounced guilty save that the Judge claims that the litigant accepted him by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> to act as Judge, it is not considered a denial of a monetary claim. If two of the Judges are eligible persons all agree that they are believed when they state that they were accepted as Judges.</ftnote>

V., Keth. XI, 1 a.e. If, however, the litigants have stronger legal rights in the heathen Courts than in the Israelite Courts, the agreement made by means of <italic>Kinyan</italic> is effective, and as to the principle that this would be considered &#x2018;an agreement made contrary to what is written in the Torah,&#x2019; it is applicable to an agreement made in a general way, and where one does not enjoy special rights in a heathen Court it would be regarded as a sheer verbal agreement (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 26) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn732">24) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> VII, 3. Derived from Mishna San. 24a: &#x2018;If a man was under obligation to take an oath before his fellow, and the latter said to him, Vow to me by the life of your head (which is not the formula of a legal oath since &#x2018;swearing&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Divine Name&#x2019; are not included), R. Meir says, He may retract; but the Sages say, He cannot retract.&#x2019; The law here is on the same footing as <italic>supra</italic> par. 1 in the case of a relative or otherwise ineligible person. V., notes <italic>ibid.</italic> which are also applicable in the present case. V., B.B. 127b-128a: &#x2018;R. Abba sent to R. Joseph b. &#x1E24;ama: If one says to his fellow, You stole my slave, and the other replies, I did not steal (him), (and when the former asks further), On what grounds did he (come) into your possession, (the latter replies), You sold him to me, you gave him to me as a gift, (but) if you wish, Take an oath (that he was neither sold nor presented) and you will get him back (although legally the possessor cannot be compelled to accept the oath of the plaintiff), and (the plaintiff) took the oath, (then the latter) is not permitted to retract. What does he inform us? We have already learnt (this elsewhere. Cf. Mishna and Gemara San. 24a): If one (of the litigants) said to the other party, I accept my father as trustworthy or I accept your father as trustworthy, or I accept three oxherds as trustworthy, R. Meir says, He may (subsequently) retract; but the Sages say, He may not retract&#x0021; &#x2014; (R. Abba) teaches us this: That the controversy (between R. Meir and the Sages) is where (a litigant stated), I will pay you, and the law accords with the Sages (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 11).&#x2019; We thus see that the case of accepting an oath which legally is not binding is equated to the case of accepting a relative or an otherwise ineligible person to act as Judge. In both cases the law is that after the close of legal proceedings, even in a case of &#x2018;I will pay you&#x2019; and before the close of legal proceedings where an agreement was made by <italic>Kinyan,</italic> one may not retract.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn733">25) V., <italic>supra</italic> n. 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn734">26) In the case where an oath is taken the proceedings are considered closed after the oath is taken. Note the expression &#x2018;Once the legal proceedings are closed <italic>and</italic> he took the oath.&#x2019; According to <italic>Rashi</italic> and <italic>Asheri</italic> the proceedings are likewise considered closed when the litigant leaves the Court.

Sheb. VI, 5) save that an equitable oath (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05EA; &#x05D4;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05EA;</span>) would have to be taken; but since in the latter case where the possessor makes a complete denial and there is not even a single witness to contradict him, the latter would have to take an equitable oath only, consequently, he may transfer the oath to the plaintiff.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn737">29) Sheb. 39a: &#x2018;If he stated, I shall not take an oath (realizing the seriousness of swearing falsely), he is dismissed (from Court) forthwith (so as not to give him a chance to change his mind, and he pays the claim. Thus <italic>Rashi</italic>). According to <italic>Tosaf.</italic> (v. sources <italic>supra</italic> n. 26) the question whether we consider the legal proceedings closed after the litigant makes his statement before the Court and then leaves or whether the oath must be taken before the litigant leaves the Court, is applicable both in the case where one was under obligation to take an oath and stated &#x2018;I desire not to take an oath etc.,&#x2019; or where the defendant transfers the oath to the claimant, or where one states &#x2018;Vow by the life of your head.&#x2019; According to those authorities who maintain that if he said &#x2018;I desire not to take an oath etc.,&#x2019; and then left Court, he may not retract, the same principle applies equally in the other cases. Those who differ with this opinion and hold that in the case of one under obligation to take an oath, the legal proceedings are considered closed only after the oath is taken, the same principle is also applicable in the other cases. Consequently, <italic>Isserles Gloss</italic> presents a difficulty. For according to the present <italic>Gloss,</italic> the difference of opinion between the above-mentioned authorities is only with respect to one who states &#x2018;I will not swear,&#x2019; but not regarding the other cases (v. <italic>M.E., ShaK</italic> and <italic>W.G</italic>.). This difficulty may be removed if we bear in mind that the law of one who was under obligation to take an oath and stated &#x2018;I desire not &#x2026; he cannot retract etc.,&#x2019; was stated only in accordance with <italic>Rashi</italic>&#x2019;s interpretation followed by <italic>Asheri</italic> (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 29). One who was under obligation to take an equitable oath in Court and did not state that he wishes to transfer the oath to his adversary and then left Court and subsequently stated that he desires to transfer the oath, is permitted to do so &#x2014; <italic>Tur.</italic> Even if he stated &#x2018;I will not swear&#x2019; and then left Court, he may subsequently transfer the oath, because we assume that what he meant is this: &#x2018;<italic>I</italic> will not swear but I will transfer the oath,&#x2019; provided he did not say, &#x2018;I will not swear but I will make payment&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> If the defendant was under obligation to take an equitable oath and he stated in Court &#x2018;I will swear&#x2019; and before taking the oath, he left, the law is that he subsequently cannot transfer the oath &#x2014; <italic>M.E. ShaK</italic> rejects the latter ruling of <italic>M.E.</italic> For only where he stated &#x2018;I will not swear but I will make payment&#x2019; he may not retract if he left the Court, because as soon as he says &#x2018;I will not swear etc.,&#x2019; it is regarded as an admission of guilt; but where he stated &#x2018;I will swear&#x2019; it is as though he said &#x2018;I am prepared to carry out the verdict,&#x2019; but it does not mean that he actually accepted to take the oath. Hence, he may subsequently transfer the oath. And this is the adopted custom in many Holy communities (v. <italic>P.Tesh</italic> conflicting views regarding this custom). This holds good only with respect to an equitable oath, but in the case of a Biblical oath where legally one may not transfer it (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 87; Sheb. 41a), if one said to his fellow &#x2018;Swear and collect&#x2019; and the latter stated &#x2018;I will swear&#x2019; and then left the Court or even where he did not leave the Court but the Judges had already commenced the discussion of another case, he may not retract &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn738">30) V., <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Cf. previous note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn739">31) And say &#x2018;I will swear and be exempt,&#x2019; but the plaintiff must take another oath while holding a sacred object. Other authoorities differ with this view and maintain that since he took the oath without holding a sacred object (e.g., a Scroll of the Law or Phylacteries) we do not consider the legal proceedings as closed and consequently, he may retract unless the litigants left the Court or the Judges commenced the discussion of another case &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> However, according to the former view, even if he took the oath outside of the Court, it is still regarded as the close of legal proceedings &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn740">1) Kid. 74a: &#x2018;A Judge is believed when he states, I have pronounced this one not guilty; I have pronounced that one guilty. When does this apply? Only if the litigants are (still) standing before him; but if they no longer stand before him, he is not believed. But let us see who holds (the document containing) the verdict in favour (since they gave a written verdict to each litigant)? &#x2014; It refers to a case where the written document was torn. Then let us give them a re-trial? &#x2014; (It refers to a case of) discretionary judgment (i.e., the Judge based his verdict on discretion and could not decide on the basis of any law. In this case we cannot be certain that a re-trial will result in the same decision).&#x2019; V., Ket. 85b. An arbitrator is likewise not believed when he states that the settlement was according to such and such terms if the litigants are no longer before him (<italic>RaShBA</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> V., <italic>Isserles</italic> anon. This is based on the following case cited by <italic>B.Yos. supra</italic> &#x00A7; 12: <italic>A</italic> gave <italic>B</italic> a gift of bonds and took an oath that he will not collect any of the debts covered by the bonds. Subsequently <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> were in dispute concerning other claims and they accepted an arbitrator on condition that whatever settlement he reaches within a certain time limit should be effective and the latter arbitrated the case and ruled that <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> should remit their claims by means of a written document excluding the case of the bonds that <italic>A</italic> had made a gift to <italic>B</italic> which are to remain in effect as of the day of arbitration and later it was discovered that <italic>A</italic> had collected money on the strength of the bonds given to <italic>B</italic> and the latter contends that the money collected by <italic>A</italic> should be returned, to which <italic>A</italic> responds that since he collected the money prior to the date on which the document of remittal became effective, notwithstanding the fact that he presented the bonds to <italic>B</italic> on condition that they remain in their original force, he should be exempt from returning the collected money especially since it states in the document of remittal drawn up by the arbitrator that the settlement excludes the bonds as of the date of arbitration. The arbitrator was consulted and he agreed with A. <italic>Responsum</italic>: The law accords with <italic>B</italic>&#x2019;s claim because when the other claims between <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> were submitted to the arbitrator, it was unknown that <italic>A</italic> had collected money on the strength of the bonds, for it was presumed that the bonds were intact since <italic>A</italic> took an oath to this effect. Consequently this did not enter into the remittal. And as to the statement of the arbitrator, he is not believed because he did not make this declaration when the litigants were still before him as in the present ruling with regards to a Judge. <italic>Nethiboth</italic> writes that the Judge is believed as long as the litigants still stand before him even if the one who was pronounced guilty could employ the principle of <italic>Miggo</italic> (i.e., since the the litigant could have stated &#x2018;I did not accept you as Judge&#x2019;), because since the Judge is believed as two witnesses, it would be tantamount to a <italic>Miggo</italic> in face of witnesses which is not effective. If the litigant contends that the Judge had pronounced judgment in his favour but the Judge and the other litigant state that the verdict had not yet been given, the Judge is believed even where the litigants are no longer before him provided that there are witnesses who testify that the litigants accepted him as Judge; but if there are no witnesses available and the litigants are no longer before the Judge, the claim of the litigant is accepted on the principle of <italic>Miggo,</italic> viz., that they did not accept him as Judge. And in this case the principle of <italic>Miggo</italic> in the face of witnesses (i.e., if we accept the statement of the Judge as equivalent to the testimony of two witnesses) is not accepted since the litigants are no longer before the Judge, in which case the latter is not regarded as equivalent to two witnesses &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic> However, the Judge is believed as one witness, provided he is not a relative or an otherwise ineligible person, and hence places the litigant who contradicts him under an oath and exempts the one who supports his statement from taking an oath. If the Judge died or left and the litigants contradict each other, each one stating that judgment was pronounced in his favour, &#x2014; the law is that if one is the possessor (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05D7;&#x05D6;&#x05E7;</span>) of the disputed article, the onus rests on the other party to produce evidence in order to substantiate his claim; if both are possessors, they divide the disputed article; if both are not possessors, the stronger of the two obtains possession or they make a settlement &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn741">2) Kid. <italic>ibid.</italic> V., previous note beg. This means that if the litigant has the judgment writ, the Judge is believed even if they are no longer standing before him. Accordingly, the question in the Gemara <italic>ibid.,</italic> &#x2018;Let us see who holds (the document containing) the verdict in favour&#x2019; refers to the latter part of the cited Baraitha (i.e., &#x2018;but if they no longer stand before him, he is not believed&#x2019;). <italic>RITBA,</italic> however, refers this question to the first part of the Baraitha (i.e., &#x2018;the Judge is believed only if the litigants are still standing before him&#x2019;). In other words, why rely on the Judge if we can see the judgment writ. For if it refers to the latter part of the Baraitha, the following difficulty arises: If we do not believe the Judge, why accept the judgment writ? &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> Where the judgment writ held by <italic>A</italic> contains an undefined statement, e.g., &#x2018;The land of So-and-so belongs to you,&#x2019; and <italic>B</italic> claims that the judgment writ was in his possession but he lost it, then the Judge is believed when he says, &#x2018;I ruled in favour of this party&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn742">3) Kid. <italic>ibid.</italic> V., <italic>supra</italic> n. 1. According to <italic>R. Tam</italic> (Kid. <italic>ibid., Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05D0;</span> a.e.) discretionary judgment means favouring or making a gift to any one of the litigants. <italic>Rashi</italic>: The Judges use their discretion in order to determine which of the claimants is to be believed. However, even if the litigants accepted the Judge to give a verdict based on discretionary judgment, it is still doubtful whether a re-trial would result in the same verdict &#x2014; <italic>ShaK, Nethiboth.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn743">4) And even while the litigants are still before the Judge, the latter is not believed, but he must clarify the matter by stating, &#x2018;So-and-so, you have pleaded thus and So-and-so, you have pleaded thus and accordingly, You are not guilty and You are guilty&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>M.E., ShaK</italic> a.o.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn744">5) I.e., there is a controversy between them, viz., the Judge says, You pleaded thus, and the litigants contradict him, in which case the Judge is not believed when they are no longer before him (and according to <italic>ShaK</italic> even if they are still before him) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn745">6) E.g., an authoritative Judge (<italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic>) or where they accepted him as Judge (according to <italic>ShaK</italic> by means of <italic>Kinyan,</italic> but <italic>M.E.</italic> maintains that <italic>Kinyan</italic> is not necessary) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Thus <italic>Tur, Asheri</italic> and <italic>RIBaSh</italic> in <italic>Resp.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn746">7) For then their statement is equivalent to evidence and they are believed &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Even if it is not a case of discretionary judgment &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic> Cf. B.M. 32a; Tosef. B.M. I, 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn747">8) <italic>Asheri</italic> in <italic>Resp.</italic> advances the following reason: The Judge is more conscious of the case than those who merely hear the proceedings. If one Judge in conjunction with a single witness made this statement and two witnesses contradict them, the Judge and the single witness are not believed, since the single witness merely <italic>heard</italic> the proceedings. Consequently, there is only one against two &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn749">1) B.K. 46b. V., text <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 16, n. 5. &#x2018;Giving prior consideration&#x2019; refers to hearing the pleas. Cf. also Tosef(Z). San. VI, 3: &#x2018;Whoever makes a claim against his fellow, opens (his pleas) first.&#x2019; The meaning of the text in B.K. <italic>ibid.</italic> is as follows: When the litigants come to Court and the claimant desires that his pleas be heard first, and so too, the defendant &#x2014; the practical difference being that the defendant might make a partial admission &#x2014; and the law is that one who makes a partial admission is required to take a Biblical oath only if the admission was made <italic>after</italic> the plaintiff made his claim (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 88, 15) &#x2014; the law is that we give prior consideration to the claimant. However, if the property of the defendant had depreciated in value or the reason he had not made payment prior to this was due to the fact that were he to dispose of his estate he would be forced to sell at a low price, &#x2014; then we attend to the defendant first, and if the defendant makes a partial admission prior to hearing the pleas of the claimant, he is not required to take a Biblical oath &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn750">2) B.K. <italic>ibid</italic>.: &#x2018;The Nehardeans said: Sometimes we attend to the defendant first, e.g., where his property depreciates in value.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn751">3) According to <italic>Rashi</italic> (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 16, n. 5) it refers to a case where the defendant has an opportunity of selling his property now at a high price &#x2014; an opportunity which will not present itself later &#x2014; then we give prior consideration to the defendant&#x2019;s counter-claim. V., <italic>ShaK</italic> (<italic>supra</italic> n. 1) for another interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn752">4) Thus B.K. <italic>ibid., Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span> according to <italic>Rashi</italic>&#x2019;s explanation. We deal here with a case where there is a document signed by witnesses that he lent him money &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 85, 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn753">5) <italic>Tur</italic> has, &#x2018;And <italic>B</italic> responds, You have taken possession of aught that belongs to me; return to me whatever you have seized,&#x2019; or he says, &#x2018;You had my pledge and it has depreciated in value.&#x2019; Even if the claimant admits to the defendant that the pledge has depreciated in value (save that they differ as to the amount of depreciation), &#x2014; nevertheless, we give prior consideration to the claimant &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn754">6) For were <italic>B</italic> to request only thirty days, the usual extension of time given by the Court, we would have complied with his wish even if his property were not to depreciate in value. But if he requests a longer extension of time in order to produce witnesses, and we are not aware that there are witnesses available,&#x2014;then even if <italic>B</italic>&#x2019;s, property depreciates in value, we do not listen to him. We deal here with a case where the Judges of the Court know that he has witnesses who are acquainted with the facts, but we do not know whether the witnesses will testify in favour of the defendant or not &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> V., <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 16, 1 and notes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn755">7) <italic>Tosaf. ibid</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn756">8) I.e., if he has money and desires to obtain an extension of time only to clarify his counter-claim and to deduct this from the loan; but if he has no money, we give him only thirty days to secure funds &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn757">9) I.e., the <italic>Beth Din</italic> see that the defendant will suffer a loss thereby, e.g., if he does not sell his pledge now (which according to him is in the claimant&#x2019;s possession), we give the defendant prior consideration and grant him his request for an extension of time even more than thirty days. Or if the <italic>Beth Din</italic> see that there will be a depreciation of his property or the like.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn758">10) I.e., <italic>A</italic> (the claimant) does not insist to be paid first but rather to have his pleas heard first. Consequently, &#x2018;unless his (<italic>B</italic>&#x2019;s) property depreciates in value&#x2019; means that if they hear <italic>A</italic>&#x2019;s pleas first, then <italic>B</italic> is designated a &#x2018;defendant&#x2019; and thereby his property will depreciate in value. Likewise, if <italic>A</italic> desires that his witnesses be heard first and <italic>B</italic> makes the same claim, we give prior consideration to <italic>A.</italic> Consequently, &#x2018;unless (<italic>B</italic>&#x2019;s) property depreciates in value&#x2019; means that <italic>B</italic>&#x2019;s witnesses might leave and go to a distant country if they are not heard forthwith &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn759">11) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>RaBaD</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G. Tur</italic> adds: &#x2018;For perhaps today or the next day he might find witnesses or the defendant will make an admission.&#x2019; This applies even if they made an agreement with the claimant by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> to be tried before the Court of Law and he had already presented his documents &#x2014; nevertheless, he may state that he desires to be dismissed and not to be tried now (it follows that if he had already presented his pleas this does not apply), unless the property of the defendant depreciates in value (<italic>RaShBA</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn760">12) <italic>N.Yos.</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> V., <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 16, n. 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn761">13) V., however, <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 87, 24, <italic>Gloss</italic> according to which <italic>Isserles</italic> holds that the claimant is told to make all his claims which contradicts the present ruling. <italic>ShaK</italic> removes this difficulty by explaining that <italic>Isserles</italic> concludes <italic>infra</italic> that if the claimant refuses to make <italic>all</italic> his claims, the defendant takes an oath and is exempt; whereas in the present ruling we deal with a case where the claimant states that he does not care if the defendant takes an oath because even if he takes an oath he will not be exempt since he has additional claims against the defendant where the question of an oath does not enter or where he will be able to produce witnesses. For additional interpretations, v., <italic>M.E.</italic> and <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn762">14) <italic>B.Yos.</italic> on the authority of <italic>RaShBe&#x1E92;</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Where <italic>A</italic> made a claim against <italic>B</italic> and the latter refused to respond being a very stern and powerful individual (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05DC;&#x05DD;</span>) and subsequently <italic>B</italic> made a claim against <italic>A,</italic> &#x2014; the law is that <italic>A</italic> is not required to respond until <italic>B</italic> responds first (<italic>D.M.</italic> on the authority of <italic>MaHaRIW</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 25: WHEN MAY A JUDGE WHO GAVE AN ERRONEOUS DECISION RETRACT AND WHEN MUST HE MAKE COMPENSATION? Contains five paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. Every Judge<sup><xref rid="fn763">1</xref></sup> who adjudicated monetary cases and gave an erroneous decision &#x2014; [the law is that] if he erred in evident and known matters, e.g., laws that are explicitly stated in the <italic>Mishna</italic><sup><xref rid="fn764">2</xref></sup> or in the <italic>Gemara</italic><sup><xref rid="fn765">3</xref></sup> or in the rulings of the Codifiers,<sup><xref rid="fn766">4</xref></sup> the verdict is reversed and it [the case] is adjudicated in accordance with the law.<sup><xref rid="fn767">5</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Yet some say that if it appears to the Judge and to his contemporaries</italic><sup><xref rid="fn768">6</xref></sup> <italic>on the strength of indisputable proof</italic><sup><xref rid="fn769">7</xref></sup> <italic>that the law does not accord with that mentioned in the Codifiers, he can differ with it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn770">8</xref></sup> <italic>since it is</italic> [<italic>a law that is</italic>] <italic>not mentioned</italic> [<italic>explicitly</italic>] <italic>in the Gemara.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn771">9</xref></sup> <italic>Nevertheless, one should not adopt a leniency in a matter that the</italic> [<italic>authors of</italic>] <italic>the</italic> [<italic>former</italic>] <italic>compilations</italic> [<italic>on Hebrew Law</italic>] <italic>that have spread among the large majority of Israelites were stringent, unless one has it on tradition from his teachers that we do not adopt that stringency</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn772">10</xref></sup> However, if it is impossibe to reverse [the verdict], e.g., where the one who received the money illegally [as a result of the erroneous decision] left for abroad or [in a case] where he is a stern individual [and refuses to return the money] or where [the Judge] pronounced aught that, is &#x2018;clean,&#x2019; &#x2018;unclean,&#x2019; or gave a decision regarding a <italic>Kosher</italic> animal that it is <italic>Terefah</italic> and they gave it to the dogs to eat, or anything similar to this, &#x2014; [the law is that] these are [cases where] he [the Judge] is exempt from making compensation<sup><xref rid="fn773">11</xref></sup> and although he was the cause of the damage, he did not cause damage intentionally.<sup><xref rid="fn774">12</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And some differ</italic> [<italic>with this opinion</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn775">13</xref></sup> <italic>And with regards to decisions in ritual law</italic>, &#x2014; <italic>if he</italic> [<italic>the Judge</italic>] <italic>has attained</italic> [<italic>the age of</italic>] <italic>ordination, although he is not</italic> [<italic>officially</italic>] <italic>ordained, his legal status is as that of an authoritative</italic> [<italic>Judge</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn776">14</xref></sup> <italic>V., Y.D. &#x00A7; 242 on the law of Ordination nowadays</italic>.</p>

<p>3. [If] he [the Judge] who erred [in his verdict] was an expert<sup><xref rid="fn799">37</xref></sup> for the Court of Law and had not obtained authorization [from the <italic>Resh Galutha</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn800">38</xref></sup> and the litigants did not accept him,<sup><xref rid="fn801">39</xref></sup> or [if] he was not an expert<sup><xref rid="fn799">37</xref></sup> but the litigants accepted him to adjudicate the case for them and he [the Judge] erred in the weighing of opinions<sup><xref rid="fn802">40</xref></sup> &#x2014; [then] if he had taken [from one] and given [to the other] with his own hand, his act cannot be undone, and he must pay indemnity from his own pocket.

<p>4. However, one who is not an expert [Judge]<sup><xref rid="fn816">54</xref></sup> and the litigants did not accept him &#x2014; [then] even if he obtained authorization he comes under the class of violent men and is not considered to be in the class of Judges.<sup><xref rid="fn817">55</xref></sup> Therefore, his verdict does not stand whether he gave an erroneous decision or not. And each one of the litigants, &#x2014; if he so desires, &#x2014; may argue his case again before a [recognized] Court of Law.<sup><xref rid="fn818">56</xref></sup> If [the incompetent Judge] gave an erroneous decision and took [from one litigant] and gave [to the other], he is obliged to pay indemnity from his own pocket<sup><xref rid="fn819">57</xref></sup> and [then] goes back and recovers from the litigant to whom he gave [aught] illegally. And if he [the litigant] has naught to restore,<sup><xref rid="fn820">58</xref></sup> or where [the incompetent Judge] declared unclean or gave to the dogs to eat aught that was permissible, he must pay indemnity<sup><xref rid="fn821">59</xref></sup> in accordance with the law of one who causes damage, &#x2014; for this [incompetent Judge] is regarded as causing damage intentionally.</p>
<p>5. A Judge who gave an erroneous decision and declared [one of the litigants] liable to take an oath to which he was [legally] not bound, and the latter made a settlement with his fellow-litigant in order not to take an oath, and subsequently he became aware that he is [legally] not bound to take an oath, &#x2014; [then] even if they made an agreement with him by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> with regards to the settlement [between him and his opponent], it is legally ineffective,<sup><xref rid="fn822">60</xref></sup> for this is considered an agreement by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> made in error and he may retract.<sup><xref rid="fn823">61</xref></sup> <italic>And so too, anything similar to this</italic>. [<italic>This is applicable</italic>] <italic>only where he indicated his express intention that he had made the settlement on account of the oath</italic> [<italic>which he would otherwise have to take</italic>] <italic>or in a case similar to this</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn824">62</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn763">1) &#x2018;Judge&#x2019; is expressly stated to indicate that we deal here only with one who is an authoritative Judge (<italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic>) or one who is not a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> but was accepted by the litigants to try the case, or three laymen even if they were not accepted by the litigants.

But if it is impossible to retract, e.g., where one left for abroad or the like (v. <italic>Caro</italic> anon), the Judge must make restitution from his own pocket even if he did not take aught from one litigant and give to the other litigant with his own hand. For even where the Judge took and gave with his own hand, and in reality this should be returned by the litigant who received it in error, the Judge must pay the litigant who suffered a loss, and then collect from the other litigant who received payment on account of the erroneous decision of the Judge. <italic>RaZaH</italic> contra <italic>Alfasi</italic> rules that since the decision is invalid, then even if the layman Judge took and gave with his own hand, he is exempt from making payment, for the litigant is responsible since he knew well that the decision of such a Judge is invalid.

Derived from Mishna San. 32a: &#x2018;In monetary cases the verdict may be reversed (on discovering that the verdict was erroneous) either (from conviction) to acquittal or (from acquittal) to conviction.&#x2019; Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic> 33a: &#x2018;But the following disagrees with it: If one adjudicated a case (by himself) and pronounced him who was guilty, not guilty, or the one who was not guilty, guilty; the clean, unclean, or <italic>vice versa</italic>: his verdict stands, but he must pay compensation (for any damage resulting from his erroneous decision) out of his own pocket (Mishna Bek. 28b. Thus we see that the verdict may not be reversed)? &#x2014; R. Joseph stated: There is no contradiction: here it (our Mishna) has reference to a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> (He had authority to upset his former decision); there (Mishna Bek.) to one who is not a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> (His decision stands but he must pay indemnity). But do we reverse the verdict in the case of a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh?</italic> Have we not learned: If he was recognized by the <italic>Beth Din</italic> as a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> he is exempt from making payment&#x0021; &#x2014; R. Na&#x1E25;man replied: Here (in our Mishna) we deal with a case where there is a Court superior to this one in learning and numbers (therefore, the superior Court can reverse the verdict of the lower Court); but in the other Mishna there is no other Court superior to this one in learning and numbers (i.e., in both Mishnahs the verdict was issued by a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh,</italic> but where there is no superior Court available, one of the litigants may oppose reversing the verdict). R. Shesheth answered: Here we deal with a case where he (the Judge) overlooked a law cited in a Mishna (Hence, the verdict may be reversed); there he erred in weighing of opinions. For R. Shesheth stated on the authority of R. Assi: If he overlooked a law cited in the Mishna, the verdict is reversed; if he erred in weighing of opinions, the verdict is not reversed. Rabina asked R. Ashi: Is this also applicable if he erred in connection with a teaching of R. &#x1E24;iyya or R. Oshaia (who were held to be the editors of the Tosefta which is not as authoritative as the Mishna)? &#x2014; Yes, he answered. And even with respect to a saying of Rab and Samuel (whose dicta were not as authoritative as the Tosefta)? &#x2014; Yes, he answered. Even regarding a law stated by you and me? &#x2014; Are we reed-cutters in a marsh (i.e., illiterate), he answered. What is meant by the statement, Weighing of (conflicting) opinions? &#x2014; R. Papa stated, E.g., if two Tannaim or Amoraim are in dispute and it was not stated with whom the law accords and it happened that he (the Judge) ruled according to the opinion of one of them, whilst the general practice (accepted by the majority of Judges. Thus <italic>Rashi</italic>) follows the other (opinion), &#x2014; this is considered a case of (erring) in the weighing of (conflicting) opinions &#x2026; R. &#x1E24;isda stated (in order to remove the contradiction between the Mishnahs <italic>supra</italic>): Here (the Mishna in Bek.) we deal with a case where he (the Judge) took with his own hand (from one litigant) and gave (to the other in which case the verdict stands); here (the Mishna in San.) where he did not take and give with his own hand (in which case the verdict is reversed).&#x2019; Hence, our ruling is in accord with R. Shesheth. Cf. also Ket. 100a; Sheb. 38b; San. 6a.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn767">5) Even if they were three authoritative Judges (<italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic>) and were accepted by the litigants to try the case, since they erred in a law cited in the Mishna &#x2014; <italic>Tur</italic> and <italic>Asheri.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn768">6) B.B. 130b-131a: &#x2018;Raba said to R. Papa and to R. Huna the son of R. Joshua: When a (written) verdict of mine comes before you, and you see in it something objectionable, do not tear it up until you come before me. If I have a (well-grounded) reason (for my verdict) I will tell (it to) you; if not, I will retract. After my death, you shall neither tear it up nor derive (any law) from it. You shall neither tear it up because were I there, I might have told you the reason; nor derive (any law) from it, because a Judge must be governed only by what his eyes discern.&#x2019; According to <italic>RaShBaM</italic> (s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D0; &#x05EA;&#x05D2;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;</span>) it means: &#x2018;Do not pronounce judgment on the basis of my verdict but issue your ruling in accord with the opinion which you are inclined to accept because everything depends upon the discernment of the Judge.&#x2019; From this we infer that one may rule in accordance with one&#x2019;s opinion and discernment even in the case where it is contrary to the written verdict of his teacher.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn769">7) V., Yeb. 42b-43a whence we see that once during a debate by Amoraim concerning an anonymous Mishna, the latter was disregarded and was not considered authoritative in the face of a valid and well-grounded objection.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn771">9) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>Asheri</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> V., B.M. 86a where it is stated that R. Ashi and Rabina arranged the vast material which accumulated up to their times and they represented the authentic body of legislation as editors of the Talmud. Consequently, the body of teachings edited by them represented the authoritative Code and hence, a law not mentioned in the Talmud could be disputed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn772">10) <italic>Decisions</italic> of <italic>Isserlein</italic> s. 241 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> V., A.Z. 36a whence <italic>RaN</italic> derives three important principles, a) If a prohibition issued by one Court has spread among the large majority of Israelites, another Court cannot annul this decision even if it is superior to the former Court in wisdom and numerical strength; b) If the prohibition of one Court has not spread among the large majority of Israelites, but the majority of people are able to abide by it, then another Court that is superior to the former Court in wisdom and numerical strength can annul the decision; c) If the prohibition of one Court did not spread among the large majority of Israelites because the majority of people are not able to abide by it, then even another Court that is inferior in wisdom and numerical strength can annul it. The law stated here refers to ritual law, for in civil suits the claimant is required to produce evidence &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn773">11) San. 33a: &#x2018;R. Hamnunah raised an objection against R. Shesheth (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 2): It once happened that a cow&#x2019;s womb was removed and R. Tarfon gave it to the dogs to eat (i.e., he declared the cow <italic>Terefah</italic>). When the case was presented before the Sages in Yabneh, they declared her permissible (for human consumption), for Theodos (or Theodoros), the Physician said that no cow or sow leaves Alexandria of Egypt unless the womb is first cut out, in order that she may not breed (This precaution was taken so as to limit its breeding only to Egypt and thus compel buyers to come to Alexandria). Said R. Tarfon: Your ass is gone, Tarfon&#x0021; (i.e., I will now have to sell my ass in order to compensate the owner of the cow for having erroneously declared it <italic>Terefah</italic>). But R. Akiba said to him: You are exempt from reparation, since he who is publicly recognized as a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> is exempt from making compensation (Mishna Bek. 28b; San. 93a). Now, if your opinion (R. Shesheth that one who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may reconsider his verdict) has substance, he (R. Akiba) should have said to him: You overlooked a law cited in the Mishna (cf. Mishna Hul. 54a: If the womb is gone the animal is not rendered <italic>Terefah</italic>) and he who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may reconsider his verdict (Hence, even if R. Tarfon were not an expert, he should be exempt. Consequently, if the cow were still here, R. Tarfon could rescind the verdict and therefore the person who gave it to the dogs should be held responsible)&#x0021; &#x2014; He (R. Akiba) gave him two reasons: Firstly, you have overlooked a law cited in the Mishna, and he who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may rescind his verdict. Secondly, Even if your error was made against common practice (Lit. &#x2018;weighing of opinions&#x2019;), you are a publicly recognnized <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh,</italic> and as such you are exempt from making reparation. Said R. Na&#x1E25;man b. Isaac to Raba: What is the objection that R. Hamnunah raised against R. Shesheth from the case of the cow? But the cow had already been given to the dogs to eat and was no longer in existence for it to be returned to its owner (i.e., a reconsideration of the verdict would be of no avail)&#x0021; &#x2014; This is what he meant: Were you to say that one who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may <italic>not</italic> reconsider the verdict, it is right, for then the verdict stands and R. Tarfon was fearful and (R. Akiba) said to him: You are recognized by the <italic>Beth Din</italic> as a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> and exempt from reparation. But if you say that he who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna <italic>may</italic> reconsider his verdict, then (R. Akiba) should have said to him: Since if the cow were still available your verdict would have been invalid and you would have done nothing, so too, now (that the cow is no longer in existence) you have done nothing (i.e., you did not give it to the dogs yourself and it was the owner&#x2019;s bad luck to have carried out your verdict [v. B.K. 100a]. Consequently, since R. Akiba did not present this argument, we conclude therefrom that if one overlooks a law cited in the Mishna, he must not reconsider the verdict).&#x2019; The present ruling accords with the interpretation of R. &#x1E24;isda in removing the contradiction between the Mishnahs in San. and Bek. V., <italic>supra</italic> n. 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn774">12) I.e., even according to R. Meir who adjudicates liability in an action of damage done indirectly (B.K. 100a) and which is the accepted law, in the present ruling all authorities agree that the Judge is not held responsible, for were this not so, no person would be willing to become a Judge. However, if the Judge took and gave with his hand even without having to resort to force, he is held responsible even if he overlooked a law cited in the Mishnah &#x2014; <italic>ShaK. M.E.</italic> and <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic> differ with <italic>ShaK</italic> and maintain that since the Judge did not have the express intention to cause damage, then even if he took and gave with his hand, the law is that if he over-looked a law cited in the Mishnah, he is not held responsible.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn775">13) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>Asheri</italic> and other <italic>Codifiers</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> I.e., the Judge is held responsible in a case where the article cannot be returned and the Judge erred by overlooking a law cited in the Mishna and we follow R. Meir&#x2019;s opinion. As to the case of R. Tarfon (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 11), it accords with the view of the Sages who oppose R. Meir and hold that liability is not adjudicated in an action of damage done indirectly. V., <italic>supra</italic> n. 12. The dissentient view holds that even three <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> who were accepted by the litigants are held responsible because we follow R. Meir&#x2019;s opinion that liability is adjudicated in an action of damage done indirectly &#x2014; <italic>M.E. ShaK</italic> concludes that if he is a publicly recognized Judge and was accepted by the litigants, then even according to the dissentient view recorded here, the Judge is exempt <italic>contra M.E. Tummim</italic> agrees with <italic>ShaK,</italic> but states that if the Judge took and gave with his own hand, although he is <italic>legally</italic> exempt yet as far as acting beyond the requirement of the law is concerned, he is held responsible. However, if he did not take and give with his own hand and erred in a law cited in the Mishna and is a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh,</italic> &#x2014; then even from the point of acting beyond the requirement of the law he is exempt as in the case of R. Akiba who exempted R. Tarfon and did not consider him liable beyond the requirements of the law. If one asks the advice of a Sage whether he should purchase certain meat or fruit, and the latter informed him that the fruit is &#x2018;clean&#x2019; or the meat &#x2018;Kosher&#x2019; and on the strength of this advice he purchased same and subsequently, it was found that the Sage had erred &#x2014; <italic>ShaK</italic> holds that if he overlooked a law cited in the Mishna, the purchase is invalid and he may retract; but if he erred &#x2018;in the weighing of opinions&#x2019; the purchaser may not retract save that the Sage or Judge is liable to make compensation if he is not a recognized authority but was only accepted by the litigants. <italic>Tummim</italic> disputes this ruling and maintains that the purchase is void and the vendor must return the money and take back his fruit or meat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn776">14) <italic>N.Yos.</italic> to San. IV beg. &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> This ruling according to <italic>N.Yos.</italic> refers to a Judge who erred in &#x2018;weighing of opinions&#x2019; in a monetary suit but not to one who erred in a law cited in the Mishna in which case the Judge is legally held responsible to make compensation unless he is an authoritative Judge ordained by the Court in the Land of Israel, or has authorization from the <italic>Resh Galutha;</italic> but in ritual law (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05D5;&#x05E8; &#x05D5;&#x05D4;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05E8;</span>) if the Judge is an expert who is versed in the law (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;</span>) and has the capacity for making logical deductions (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;</span>), he is not held responsible. Consequently, since the present ruling refers only to one who erred in a law cited in the Mishna, <italic>Isserles</italic> should have stated this law in the next par. which deals with the law of &#x2018;erring in the weighing of opinions&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>M.E. ShaK</italic> writes that no distinction should be made between monetary and ritual cases <italic>contra N.Yos.</italic> and <italic>Isserles.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn777">15) Likewise in the case of a controversy among the <italic>Codifiers</italic> nowadays &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn778">16) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> VI, 2. Derived from San. 33a in accord with R. Papa. V., text <italic>supra</italic> n. 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn779">17) I.e., he was only aware that the matter is in dispute; but if the Judge was aware of one opinion only, according to which he rendered his decision, his verdict stands and he does not make compensation &#x2014; <italic>M.E. ShaK</italic> cites dissenting views with which he is inclined to agree on the principle that &#x2018;an error in study amounts to a wilful act&#x2019; (Aboth IV, 13). Consequently, where the Judge should have known the opposing viewpoint, it is self-evident that he is considered as having given an erroneous decision (cf. case of R. Tarfon <italic>supra</italic> n. 11 whose erroneous decision was the result of lack of study). However, in the case where the Judge was not expected to know about the other viewpoint (e.g., where a certain source of law was unknown in his locality), this comes under the rule of <italic>force majeure</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05E1;</span>) and his decision stands. In any case, he is not held liable. If there exists no controversy concerning a certain matter of law save that the law is not explicit thereon, and the accepted practice is based on a logical deduction or the like, and the Judge ruled <italic>contra</italic> the accepted practice, he is regarded as one who erred in a law cited in the Mishna &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn780">18) Thus Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> V., however, explanation of <italic>Rashi</italic> on &#x2018;general practice&#x2019; <italic>supra</italic> n. 2. &#x2018;Throughout the world&#x2019; does not exclude a certain country or district on the principle that &#x2018;everything is according to the custom of the district&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> Where no &#x2018;general practice&#x2019; prevails the Judge should render his decision on the basis of the inclination of his personal judgment &#x2014; <italic>N.Yos.</italic> on the authority of <italic>R. Jonah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn781">19) Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> Derived from San. 5a: &#x2018;Rab stated: Whoever desires to render decisions in monetary cases by himself and be exempt from liability (in the case of giving an erroneous decision) should obtain authorization from the <italic>Resh Galutha</italic>.&#x2019; This is applicable even if the Judge took from one and gave to the other with his own hand on the principle that &#x2018;confiscation by the Court (i.e., disposing of private property by the process of law) is valid&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05E4;&#x05E7;&#x05E8; &#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05EA; &#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05D4;&#x05E4;&#x05E7;&#x05E8;</span>). V., Yeb. 89b; Git. 36b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn782">20) Derived from San. 5a regarding Mar Zutra b. R. Na&#x1E25;man and Rabbah b. &#x1E24;ana who each adjudicated a case alone and gave an erroneous decision and they were informed that if the litigants accepted them as their Judges, they are not obliged to make restitution. Cf. also Mishna and Gemara Bek. 28b whence we derive that if a Judge issues an erroneous decision, the verdict stands but the Judge must make restitution, the reason in this case being that he executed the judgment alone, and in the latter part of the Mishna (Bek. <italic>ibid</italic>.) it states that if the Judge was a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh,</italic> he is exempt from making restitution, even if he executes the judgment alone since the litigants accepted him. V., also Bek. <italic>ibid.</italic> in the case of the cow (<italic>supra</italic> n. 11) the statement of R. Akiba to R. Tarfon: &#x2018;You are exempt from reparation since he who is publicly recognized as a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> is exempt from making compensation. In the present ruling since the parties accepted him it is equivalent to one who was a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh.</italic> The law here obtains even if the parties did not accept him explicitly by means of a <italic>Kinyan,</italic> but merely appeared before the Judge for trial of their own accord &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn783">21) Even nowadays if one possesses vast erudition in the Talmud and Codes and has a logical mind and is experienced in legal matters and does not err, he is regarded as a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh.</italic> Although <italic>Isserles supra</italic> &#x00A7; 3, 2 writes that &#x2018;nowadays we do not conduct proceedings of adjudication (of monetary cases) by a recognized <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; he refers to adjudication by a single Judge, but regarding the obligation to make payment in the case of an erroneous decision, the law is applicable nowadays too. The Judge, however, must be a publicly recognized authority and we do not accept his word if he states, &#x2018;I am an authoritative Judge&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn784">22) There is no question that the verdict is reversed where the Judge did not execute the judgment personally by his own hand in which case <italic>Caro</italic> following <italic>Alfasi</italic> and <italic>Maim.</italic> holds that even if he is not an authoritative Judge the verdict is upset (v. <italic>infra</italic> par. 3), but even if he personally executed the judgment by his own hand and is not obliged to make restitution, the verdict is reversed on account of the loss suffered by the innocent party. <italic>Isserles</italic> (<italic>infra</italic> par. 3) cites a dissenting opinion (<italic>Asheri</italic> and <italic>Tur</italic>) that even if the Judge did not execute the judgment personally by his own hand, the verdict stands and the Judge must make restitution &#x2014; <italic>M.E., ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn785">23) V., <italic>supra</italic> par. 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn786">24) I.e., if the parties accepted them they are not liable in the case of an erroneous decision &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> With regards to acceptance of the Judges there is the following distinction to be made between an authoritative Judge (<italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic>) and three laymen: In the former case appearance for trial is tantamount to valid acceptance so that if the Judge errs, he is not held liable; whereas in the latter case the litigants must state explicitly that they accept the laymen to act as Judges &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic> Cf. San. 4b-5a: &#x2018;Our Rabbis taught: Monetary suits are tried by three; but one who is publicly recognized as an authoritative Judge (<italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic>) may judge alone.&#x2019; Hence, the first part of this passage must deal with three laymen Judges. V., <italic>Tosaf. ibid.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05DF;</span>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn787">25) This means that there is no general practice prevalent.

A.Z. 7a: &#x2018;Our Rabbis taught: If one consulted a Sage who pronounced (aught) as unclean, he should not consult another Sage who might pronounce it as clean; if one Sage pronounced (aught) as forbidden, one should not consult another Sage who might pronounce it as permitted. If of two Sages, one pronounces (aught) as unclean and the other as clean, one forbids and the other permits, then if one of them is superior to the other in learning and in numbers (of disciples), his ruling should be followed, otherwise, the one who adopts the stricter view should be followed. R. Joshua b. Kor&#x1E25;a states: In laws (stated explicitly) in the Torah, adopt the stricter view; in laws (enacted) by the Scribes (the <italic>Soferim</italic> from the time of Ezra and on), adopt the lenient view. Said R. Joseph: The <italic>Halachah</italic> rests with R. Joshua b. Kor&#x1E25;a.&#x2019; Hence, we see that there are specific rules to be followed in giving decisions and one has no right to adopt a dissenting view without a well-grounded reason.</ftnote>

Although the ruling is that we follow the later authorities, nevertheless, this principle is applicable only when the later authority clarifies his viewpoint on the basis of well-grounded arguments and proof (<italic>R. Moses Ruttenberg</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> V., also <italic>Tummim</italic> on principles to be followed in this matter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn799">37) Heb. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05D4;</span>. I.e., he is versed in the law and possesses reasoning power. Likewise, <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> mentioned <italic>supra</italic> par. 2 has the same meaning. But if he is unversed in the law and does not possess reasoning power, obtaining authorization has no legal effect &#x2014; <italic>ShaK contra M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn800">38) V. Glos.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn801">39) V. <italic>supra</italic> n. 20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn802">40) Derived from the first part of Mishna Bek. 28b in accord with R. &#x1E24;isda (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 2) where the Judge was not an expert (<italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic>), (since the latter part of the Mishna (<italic>ibid.</italic>) deals with a Judge who was a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic>) and it treats of a case where the litigants accepted him as their Judge (v. San. 6a). If the parties accepted one who was unversed in the law, his verdict stands, provided he did not give an erroneous decision. If Judges who were unversed in the law erred in the weighing of opinions, the verdict becomes void and has no legal effect unless an agreement was made with the litigants by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn803">41) In accord with R. &#x1E24;isda. V., text <italic>supra</italic> n. 2. Likewise, if the Court messenger executed the judgment personally with his own hand following the instructions of the Court, it is as though the Court itself acted thus &#x2014; <italic>Tummim.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn804">42) V. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn805">43) In all the aforementioned rulings, Yad (source of <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s ruling) follows <italic>Alfasi</italic> save in the present ruling where <italic>Alfasi</italic> exempts the Judge &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn806">44) Even if the litigant is available and can pay, he is free from liability because the verdict stands and the Judge must make compensation &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn807">45) <italic>Asheri</italic> and <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> This follows the opinion of those authorities who maintain that we do not adopt the explanation of R. &#x1E24;isda who makes a distinction between executing the judgment personally or not, for R. &#x1E24;isda&#x2019;s explanation follows the opinion of the Sages who hold that we do not adjudicate liability for damage done indirectly. Hence, the Judge is liable only if he executes the judgment personally with his own hand. We, however, follow R. Meir who maintains that we adjudicate liability for damage done indirectly. V., <italic>supra</italic> nn. 12 and 13. As to the conflict between the Mishnas in San. and Bek. (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 2), we accept the explanation of R. Shesheth and it matters not whether the Judge is an expert (<italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic>) and the litigants did not accept him, or if he is not an expert and the parties accepted him. If, however, the Judge pronounced the innocent, guilty, and the latter had not yet made payment, the verdict is reversed since the judgment was not carried out &#x2014; <italic>ShaK contra M.E.</italic> It should be noted that when we speak of carrying out the judgment with one&#x2019;s hand (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05E9;&#x05D0; &#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05EA;&#x05DF; &#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05D3;</span>), it refers to carrying out the <italic>entire</italic> judgment, but if only part of the judgment was executed, it is legally effective only in proportion to that part &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth contra K.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn808">46) Derived from San. 6a: (ref. to &#x2018;If one tried a case by himself and declared the guilty, not guilty &#x2026; act cannot be undone&#x2019;): &#x2018;..Here we deal with a case where the litigants accepted the Judge. If so, why should he make compensation? &#x2014; Because they had said to him: We agree to abide by your award on condition that you issue a verdict in accordance with the Torah.&#x2019; <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s text follows the reading of <italic>Alfasi</italic> and <italic>Asheri</italic> (San. <italic>ibid</italic>.) that the litigants said to the Judge, &#x2018;We accepted you on condition that you issue a verdict in accordance with the Torah, but we did not accept you to give an erroneous decision.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn809">47) <italic>Tur</italic> and <italic>Alfasi</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> If the Judge whom they accepted was a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> then even if the litigants explicitly stated, &#x2018;Give us a decision in accordance with the Torah,&#x2019; the acceptance is valid and in the case of an erroneous decision, the Judge is absolved from making compensation &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> The present ruling is applicable even if no agreement was entered into by means of a <italic>Kinyan.</italic> However, if they accepted individuals who are entirely unversed in the law, then <italic>Kinyan</italic> is required, for such a case is on an equal footing with arbitration (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 12) &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn810">48) Likewise if they are compelled on account of a penalty that would be imposed upon them &#x2014; <italic>Tummim contra ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn811">49) V. San. 3a where we are informed that in monetary suits even laymen may act as Judges so as &#x2018;not to bolt the door against borrowers&#x2019; (for creditors will refuse to grant loans were they to be subjected to collecting their debts by <italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic>). The Gemara asks why should non-<italic>Mum&#x1E25;in</italic> not be protected against a claim of compensation in the event that they give an erroneous decision? The very same reason (&#x2018;so as not to bolt the door against borrowers&#x2019;) is given. But this reason is applicable only where the laymen Judges tried the case willingly. However, it follows that where they were compelled to act as Judges, the above reason does not apply. Hence, they must not pay indemnity in the case of an erroneous decision.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn812">50) For this very reason a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> who was accepted by the litigants is exempt in the case of an erroneous decision, for one who is a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> is under compulsion to act as Judge. V., <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 10, 3: <italic>&#x2018;Yea, a mighty host are her slain</italic> &#x2014; refers to one who has attained (the age of) ordination, but avoids giving decisions.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn813">51) <italic>Mord.</italic> to San. beg. &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Before they executed the judgment they should reverse the verdict as in the case of every Judge who errs in the &#x2018;weighing of opinions.&#x2019; And if they refuse to retract and exacted money after they became aware of the erroneous decision, they must make compensation. But if they became aware of the error after they executed the judgment, the verdict stands even in the case of Judges who were appointed by means of the ban (<italic>&#x1E24;erem</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK contra M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn814">52) San. 30a. For without the third Judge it would have been impossible to bring the legal proceedings to a close, since monetary suits are decided by three Judges, &#x2014; consequently, each one of the two Judges pays a third, and the third Judge who did not concur with the other two is certainly exempt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn815">53) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> For in this case we cannot say that without the participation of the two dissenting Judges the legal proceedings would not have been brought to a close.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn816">54) V. <italic>supra</italic> n. 37.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn817">55) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> VI, 4. Derived from San. 5a. V., text <italic>supra</italic> n. 19 where we deal with a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> in which case authorization is legally effective even if the parties did not accept him. Cf. <italic>ibid.</italic> cases dealt with by Mar Zutra and Rabba b. &#x1E24;ana and V., <italic>ibid.</italic> 7b regarding members of the <italic>Nasi</italic>&#x2019;s household who once appointed an incompetent Judge.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn818">56) San. 6a (ref. to &#x2018;Said R. Abbahu: A judgment given by two in monetary cases is not valid&#x2019;). V., also <italic>supra</italic> n. 40 whence we derive that if the Judge is not a <italic>Mum&#x1E25;eh</italic> and was not accepted by the litigants, the decision, whether erroneous or not, is invalid. Under such conditions a new extension of time to appear in Court is given and any former admission made before the incompetent Judge is invalid &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn819">57) In accordance with R. Meir who adjudicates liability for damage done indirectly. V., <italic>supra</italic> nn. 12 and 13. Even <italic>Alfasi</italic> who maintains that R. Meir&#x2019;s principle is not applicable in the case of Judges, since the latter are under <italic>force majeure</italic> to act as Judges, will, however, agree that in the present case the Judge is not considered an incompetent Judge but rather a lawless and violent person who has the express intention to cause damage.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn820">58) <italic>ShaK</italic> (following <italic>Kes. Mish</italic>.) emends the text as follows: &#x2018;If he did not take (from one) and give (to the other) the verdict is reversed and if he has naught to etc.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn821">59) Provided that he compelled the litigant to pay; but if not, he is exempt &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn822">60) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> VI, 5. Thus <italic>&#x2018;Ittur</italic> on the authority of <italic>Alfasi</italic> in <italic>Resp.</italic> who explains that subsequently it became evident that the litigant could be subjected only to an unqualified <italic>&#x1E24;erem. Kes. Mish.</italic> writes that the present ruling is applicable only when the Judge overlooked a law cited explicitly in the Mishna or erred in weighing of opinions, in which case the error may be ascertained. But where this is impossible, we apply the principle &#x2018;that the claimant must produce evidence.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn823">61) For were the litigant to know that he was not bound to take an oath he would not have entered into a settlement. This applies only if the litigant had not yet made payment. But if payment had already been made and the Judge erred in the weighing of opinions, the verdict stands and the act cannot be undone. Likewise, if one agreed to settle an inheritance for a small amount, for he thought that the estate was small, and subsequently it became known to him that the estate was larger, it is considered an agreement made by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> in error and he may retract. V., Git. 14a.</ftnote>

One who resorted to heathen Courts and was pronounced guilty by their laws, and then he</italic> [<italic>the guilty person</italic>] <italic>summoned him</italic> [<italic>his fellow-litigant</italic>] <italic>again before Israelite Judges, &#x2014; some say that we do not attend to his</italic> [<italic>case</italic>];<sup><xref rid="fn834">10</xref></sup> <italic>while others say that we do attend to his</italic> [<italic>case</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn835">11</xref></sup> <italic>unless he was the cause of a loss to his fellow-litigant before the heathen</italic> [<italic>Courts</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn836">12</xref></sup> <italic>However, the former opinion seems to me to be fundamental</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn837">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. [If] the hand of the heathen [Judges] was powerful, and his fellow-litigant is a stern individual [refusing to appear for trial in a Jewish Court] and he [the claimant] cannot retrieve [his claim] from him through Israelite Judges, &#x2014; [then] he should summon him [the recalcitrant defendant] before Israelite Judges first.<sup><xref rid="fn838">14</xref></sup> If he refuses to appear, &#x2014; [then] he obtains permission from the [Jewish] Court of Law and retrieves [his claim] through heathen Courts from the hand of his fellow-litigant<sup><xref rid="fn839">15</xref></sup>. <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>The</italic> [<italic>members of the Jewish</italic>] <italic>Court of Law have the right to go before the heathen</italic> [<italic>Courts</italic>] <italic>and bear testimony that this party is guilty to that party</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn840">16</xref></sup> <italic>This entire</italic> [<italic>ruling is applicable</italic>] <italic>only when</italic> [<italic>the recalcitrant person</italic>] <italic>refuses to heed the</italic> [<italic>Jewish Court of</italic>] <italic>Law, but otherwise the</italic> [<italic>Jewish</italic>] <italic>Court of Law is forbidden to give</italic> [<italic>one</italic>] <italic>permission to appear for trial before a heathen</italic> [<italic>Court</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn841">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. Whosoever accepted by means of a <italic>Kinyan</italic> to be tried before a heathen [Court], &#x2014; [the law is that] it has no legal effect and it is forbidden to be tried before them.<sup><xref rid="fn842">18</xref></sup> However, if one accepted [in the presence of witnesses]<sup><xref rid="fn843">19</xref></sup> that if he will not go [and be tried] before them [the heathens], [then] he will be obliged to give such and such a sum [of money] to the poor, &#x2014; [the law is that] he is forbidden to go and be tried with him [his adversary] before a heathen [Court] and he is obliged to give whatever he undertook [to contribute] to the poor.<sup><xref rid="fn844">20</xref></sup> There is [an authority] who states that the [Jewish] Court of Law does not exact [this pledge] from him [against his will] save that they inform him that the vow takes effect upon him.<sup><xref rid="fn845">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>4.

<ftnote id="fn830">6) <italic>MaHaRIK</italic> Rt. 154 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> B.K. 117a regarding the two persons who were in dispute about a certain net. When one of them surrendered it to the public office for confiscation, Abaye ruled that the latter could plead that when he surrendered it it was his own property. But Raba maintained that we must pronounce the ban against him until he brings back the net and appears for trial before the Court. V., <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 4, n. 6. Hence, in the present ruling where one resorts to heathen Courts even Abaye would agree with Raba. For in the case of the net, if it is really his, there is no prohibition involved by giving it to the heathen Court; but where it still has to be ascertained whether the article is his, even Abaye will agree with Raba &#x2014; <italic>Be&#x2019;er Eliyahu.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn831">7) <italic>RIBaSh</italic> s. 102 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Sheb. 47b: &#x2018;Simeon b.

XX, 13): thou shalt not cause adultery to be committed (the Heb. text may be pointed as the <italic>Hiph&#x2018;il</italic>). Hence, one who strengthens the hands of those who commit severe transgressions is also subject to the ban. Resorting to heathen Courts is a severe transgression. V., <italic>supra</italic> n. 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn832">8) I.e., without obtaining the authorization of the Jewish Court.

Jacob said: The ban is pronounced against it.&#x2019; The same principle operates in the present ruling.

<ftnote id="fn837">13) We do not examine his case even if it was discovered that the reason he was found guilty by the heathen Court was on account of a bribe that was given to the heathen Judge by his adversary &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic></ftnote>

But where the Court does not know whether the defendant is guilty, e.g., in the case of a verbal loan, &#x2014; then the Court gives the claimant permission to use means of compulsion through the heathen Courts in order that the defendant appear for trial before the Jewish Court of Law &#x2014; <italic>Nethiboth.</italic> We do not permit him to summon the defendant before heathen Courts unless it is impossible to collect the claim by means of an <italic>Adrakta</italic> &#x2014; <italic>Ba&#x2018;al ha-Terumoth.</italic></ftnote>

This applies only to a case of a single witness, but not if there were two.&#x2019; Hence, much more so in our present case where the Jewish Court of Law bears testimony on behalf of a fellow Israelite, it would be permissible. <italic>A.H.</italic> writes that this is applicable whether the claimant is Jewish or not.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 27: NOT TO CURSE A JUDGE OR ANY ISRAELITE. Contains two paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. One who curses an Israelite,<sup><xref rid="fn851">1</xref></sup> <italic>and even</italic> [<italic>if</italic>] <italic>he curses himself</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn852">2</xref></sup> &#x2014; by the [Divine] Name or by a substitute,<sup><xref rid="fn853">3</xref></sup> or by one of the names that the heathens call the Holy One, Blessed be He,<sup><xref rid="fn854">4</xref></sup> &#x2014; if this took place in the presence of witnesses<sup><xref rid="fn855">5</xref></sup> and [was preceded by] warning,<sup><xref rid="fn856">6</xref></sup> he receives lashes<sup><xref rid="fn857">7</xref></sup> on account of [the negative precept] &#x2018;Thou shalt not curse the deaf,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn858">8</xref></sup> and if [the cursed person] was a Judge, he receives additional lashes on account of [the negative precept] &#x2018;Thou shalt not curse the Judges.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn859">9</xref></sup> And [if one cursed by] <italic>Arur</italic> it is considered a form of curse.<sup><xref rid="fn860">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. If no legal warning [preceded] therein,<sup><xref rid="fn861">11</xref></sup> or where one uttered a curse without the [Divine] Name, or without a substitute, or the curse was the result of an implication [from] the words [that he uttered],<sup><xref rid="fn862">12</xref></sup> e.g., where he stated, &#x2018;May So-and-so not be blessed unto the Lord,&#x2019; he receives no lashes.<sup><xref rid="fn863">13</xref></sup> <italic>So too, one who curses the dead is exempt</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn864">14</xref></sup> However, there is, nevertheless, a prohibition [against this]. If one put a scholar to shame, they pronounce the ban against him,<sup><xref rid="fn865">15</xref></sup> and if the Judges wish to inflict upon him the penalty of chastisement,<sup><xref rid="fn866">16</xref></sup> they may strike him and [thus] punish him as much as they see fit.<sup><xref rid="fn866">16</xref></sup> And if one put an illiterate person to shame, they punish him according to the demand of the hour,<sup><xref rid="fn867">17</xref></sup> [and according to the status of the one who puts to shame and the one put to shame],<sup><xref rid="fn868">18</xref></sup> <italic>even if the one put to shame</italic> (<italic>another version</italic>: <italic>the one cursed</italic>) <italic>has foregone</italic> [<italic>his honour</italic>], <italic>we punish him</italic> [<italic>the offender</italic>], <italic>for he had already committed a sin and had become guilty</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn869">19</xref></sup> One who was sentenced to be placed under the ban because he acted contumaciously towards the Court of Law, and [the members of] the Court of Law wished to forego their honour and did not place him under the ban, they have a right to do so,<sup><xref rid="fn870">20</xref></sup> provided [that as a result of the Court&#x2019;s leniency] there will not result in this matter a lessening of honour towards the Creator, e.g., where the people acted rebelliously towards the honour of the Torah and the Judges, &#x2014; [then the law is that] since the people act contumaciously in [this matter], they [the Court of Law] should enforce measures [for the protection of the Law] and mete out punishment according to their discretion.<sup><xref rid="fn871">21</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn851">1) Mishna Sheb. 35a and Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic> 36a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn852">2) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Mishna and Gemara <italic>ibid</italic>.: &#x2018;For it is written, <italic>Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul</italic> (life) <italic>diligently</italic> (Deut. IV, 9. In Ber. 32a this verse is taken to mean that one should take good care of the body and its needs and not subject himself to dangers whence it is implied that it is forbidden to curse oneself) and &#x2026; wherever it is said, <italic>take heed, lest,</italic> or <italic>not,</italic> it is nothing but a negative precept (Hence, in this verse <italic>take heed to thyself</italic> also means &#x2018;do not invoke any curse upon thyself&#x2019;).&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn853">3) Mishna <italic>ibid</italic>.: &#x2018;(If one said to witnesses, I adjure you) by <italic>Alef-Daleth</italic> (the first two letters of <italic>Adonai,</italic> the Lord) or by <italic>Yod-He</italic> (the Tetragrammaton) or by <italic>Shaddai</italic> (the Almighty) or by <italic>&#x1E92;ebaoth</italic> ([Lord] of Hosts) or by the Merciful and Gracious One, or by Him that is long-suffering and of great kindness, or by any of the substitutes of the Name, they are liable &#x2026; If a man cursed himself or his fellow by any of them, he transgresses a negative precept.&#x2019; Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic> 36a: &#x2018;R. Jannai said: This is the view of both (i.e., R. Meir and the Sages both agree that one who curses himself or his neighbour not merely by the Name, but even by any of the substitutes, transgresses a negative precept).&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn854">4) V. San. 60a whence it is derived that substitutes for the Divine Name employed by heathens are considered valid substitutes. Cf. also Ned. 3a, 10a where substitutes regarding vows are considered the foreign equivalents of the Hebrew. Thus Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXVI, 3 and <italic>Tur</italic> a.l.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn855">5) V. Deut. XIX, 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn856">6) V. Ket. 33a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn857">7) Thus was the procedure in Temple days. Derived from Tem. 3a-b, 4a: &#x2018;R. Iddi b. Abin stated on the authority of R. Amram, R. Isaac and R. Jo&#x1E25;anan: R. Jose the Galilean reported: With regards to every negative precept laid down in the Torah, if one performs an act (in violating it) he is punished with lashes, but if he does not perform an act (in violating it) he is exempt, save in the case of one who takes an oath, exchanges (an unconsecrated animal for one that is consecrated), and curses his fellow with the Name, in which cases, although he performed no act, he is punished (with lashes) &#x2026; And he who curses his neighbour with the Name: Whence is this derived? &#x2014; R. Eleazar stated on the authority of R. Oshaia: The text reads, <italic>If thou wilt not observe to do</italic> etc. (Deut. XXVIII, 58. The verse continues: <italic>That thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, the Lord thy God,</italic> which intimates that one should not utter the Divine Name in vain and likewise one who curses his neighbour with the Divine Name is included in the same category). And it is written, <italic>Then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful</italic> (v. 59). Now I do not know what is the nature of this <italic>wonder</italic> (peculiarity of punishment). But when it says (<italic>ibid.</italic> XXV, 2): <italic>That the judge cause him to lie down to be beaten</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D4;&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;</span> which is similar to the expression <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D4;&#x05E4;&#x05DC;&#x05D0;</span> <italic>He will make &#x2026; wonderful</italic>), this indicates that the <italic>wonderful</italic> (punishment) refers to punishment with lashes &#x2026; Why not say &#x2026; since he transgresses two things, first in uttering the Lord&#x2019;s Name in vain and then in irritating his fellow, consequently, punishment with lashes should not suffice? &#x2014; You cannot say thus, for it is written, <italic>Thou shalt not curse the deaf</italic> (Lev. XIX, 14 whether with or without the Divine Name).&#x2019; Thus also in Y. Sheb. IV, 10(35d) in accord with R. Jose <italic>contra</italic> the Colleagues. V., however, <italic>RaBaD</italic> to Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> who on the basis of Y. <italic>ibid.</italic> deduces that if one cursed with a substitute he is not punished by lashes. It is only when he curses with the Tetragrammaton, although no act is performed, yet lashes are administered. V., <italic>Kes. Mish.</italic> to Yad <italic>ibid.</italic> who defends <italic>Maim.</italic> against <italic>RaBaD</italic>&#x2019;s stricture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn858">8) Lev. XIX, 14. Actually the negative precept <italic>Thou shalt not curse the deaf</italic> includes all persons. The deaf was singled out, although he does not hear and is not subjected to any suffering, so that people should not take advantage of his infirmity. Thus Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXVI, 1 and <italic>Tur</italic> a.l. &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> Cf. also Sifra to Lev. <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn859">9) Ex. XXII, 27. Thus San. 66a. This, however, refers to a permanent Judge &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn860">10) Sheb. 36a. It must, however, contain the Name or its substitutes &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn861">11) I.e., when one uttered a curse. Thus Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXVI, 4. For we might have thought that since transgressing this negative precept does not involve the performance of any act (v. <italic>supra</italic> nn. 6 and 7), consequently, warning should not be required, we are, therefore, informed otherwise.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn862">12) V. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn863">13) Mishna Sheb. 35a in accord with the Sages. For when God withholds his blessing it follows that the person is under a curse &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn864">14) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXVI, 2. Derived from Sifra <italic>ibid.</italic> V., also Mishna San. 85b: &#x2018;One who curses (his parents) after death is liable.&#x2019; Hence, since the verse <italic>His father or his mother he hath cursed</italic> (Lev. XX, 9) was singled out, it follows that for other dead he is not held liable.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn865">15) V. Y.D. &#x00A7; 242 and &#x00A7; 334; Kid. 70b. V., text <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 7, n. 32.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn866">16) V. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 8, 5, n. 45. This may mean either in addition to proclaiming the ban against him, or it means that if inflicting stripes for disobedience would be more effective, we administer the latter punishment &#x2014; <italic>M.E.</italic> The penalty of chastisement is administered at the discretion of the Court and is Rabbinical in origin. V., <italic>Maim. Comm.</italic> to Naz. IV, 3; Hul. 141b. Heb. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E8;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span> according to <italic>Rashi</italic> is equivalent to <span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05D4;</span> &#x2018;blows enforcing submission.&#x2019; This is inflicted for a past offence, but one who refuses to observe a positive precept, even if it is Rabbinical, they may admnister blows until his soul departs, if he is still stubborn, or until he observes the precept (Ket. 86a; Tosef. Mak. III, 10).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn867">17) B.K. 91a (ref. to Mishna <italic>ibid.</italic> 90a: &#x2018;If he spat on his neighbour and the spittle reached him [he must pay him four hundred Zuz&#x2019;]): Said R. Papa: This was taught only where it reached him (his person), but if only his garment, it is not so. But why should this not be equated to an insult in words? &#x2014; It was said in the West on the authority of R. Jose b. Abin that this means that if he insulted him in words, he would be exempt from any liability.&#x2019; <italic>R. Sherira</italic> observes that what is meant here is that he is exempt from paying the above-mentioned sum, but it does not exclude punishment entirely. This may be seen from Mishna &#x2018;Ar. 15a: &#x2018;One who speaks with his mouth suffers more than he who commits an act.&#x2019; Hence, the <italic>Beth Din</italic> subjects him to a punishment according to their discretion. Consequently, the ruling here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn868">18) Thus Yad <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn869">19) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> This <italic>Gloss</italic> should come at the end of par 1 &#x2014; <italic>Be&#x2019;er ha-Golah.</italic> Derived from Mak. 13b whence it is seen that the Earthly Tribunal does not grant remission to those who have become liable by sentence of a human Court, even if they should do penance.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn870">20) Yad, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> XXVI, 6. Derived from Ket. 17a: &#x2018;If a <italic>Nasi</italic> foregoes his honour, his honour is foregone.&#x2019; V., <italic>Kes. Mish. ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn871">21) For sometimes adopting a leniency might lead to the profanation of the Name of Heaven. V., Yoma 22b.</ftnote>
