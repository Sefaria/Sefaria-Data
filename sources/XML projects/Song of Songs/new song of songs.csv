Commentary on Song of Songs 1:1:1,"<b>The Song of Songs:</b> The most pleasant of canticles, the choicest of songs; words of might recited by the Throne of Glory,<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote""> Usually understood by Kabbalists as referring to <i>malkhut</i>, the tenth <i>sefirah</i>, the feminine-receptive aspect of the Godhead.</i> day to day expressing utterance, standing in prayer in good order arrayed, its speech lucid, in all things well ordered and sure."
Commentary on Song of Songs 1:1:2,"<b>Which is Solomon’s:</b> This is a name designating the Holy One, blessed be He. As it is written: “Gideon built there an altar to the Lord and called it ‘the Lord of peace’” [Judges 6:24].

Commentary on Song of Songs 1:2:2,"<b>For your love is better</b> [<i>tovim</i>] <b>than wine:</b> This emanated light expands over me because it comes from You, that is to say, it is derived from “wine,” from divine Wisdom called “I,” the rung of supernal luminescence. All desire and will is to ascend and adhere to Wisdom."
Commentary on Song of Songs 1:2:3,"<b>For your love is better</b> [<i>tovim</i>] <b>than wine:</b> The phrase “is better” [<i>tovim</i>] refers to the outpouring and amplification of that clear light, which divides and shines in all directions.<sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote""> The word <i>tovim</i> is plural: your love is an improvement upon the wine of <i>ḥokhmah</i>, as it flows in multiple directions.</i> As it says: “when Aaron lights <i>[behetivo]</i> the lamps” [Exod. 30:8]—which the Aramaic translation renders as “kindles.” Such also is the meaning of “God saw that the light was good” [Gen. 1:4].<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote""> “Goodness” is the ongoing flow of light from lamp to lamp, the ceaseless flow of divine life, through the <i>sefirot</i> and into the world.</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 1:3:1,"<b>Your oils are of fine aroma:</b> He calls the effulgent flow from the Glory, the gateway to the entities, “aroma.” From there it increases and flows down into the seventy branches that surround the central column.

With respect to this matter and in accord with the interpretation which I have provided here, our Sages have stated in the Midrash to Canticles: ‘“The King has brought me to his chambers’: These are the chambers of the Garden of Eden.”"
Commentary on Song of Songs 1:6:1,"These are the <i>shekhinah</i>’s words, who descended with our father Jacob to Egypt, as it is written: “I will descend with you to Egypt” [Gen. 46:4]. She participated in Israel’s exile, as our sages state: “When they were exiled to Egypt, the Presence was with them, as it states: ‘Was I not exiled with you with the house of your fathers when you were in Egypt?’ [I Sam. 2:27].”<sup>47</sup><i class=""footnote""> In Tractate Megillah 29a.</i> She complains and thunders forth about her being in exile, traveling darkened with the angelic forces apportioned to the world’s nations.

I have no leisure to watch over My people, for they are not in their land and I accompany them in their exile.

Commentary on Song of Songs 1:7:1,<b>Tell me:</b> Show me your place so that I might go there; so that you might dwell with me as before; so that my children might return as in ancient days.
Commentary on Song of Songs 1:7:2,"<b>Where do you pasture your sheep?:</b> Pasturing refers to the satisfaction derived from the joy of emanation and its superabundance. Our sages designated this as “eating.” As they stated in <i>Midrash Shemot Rabbah: “</i>They saw God” [Exod. 24:11], their eyes drew their nourishment from the <i>shekhinah</i>. R. Yohanan states that this was true eating. As it says: “In the King’s countenance resides life” [Prov. 16:15].<sup>51</sup><i class=""footnote""> Compare <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 20:10.</i>"

Commentary on Song of Songs 1:8:1,"The Glory replies: <b>If you do not know, O fairest of women</b> the cause of my removal and the delay of the End and desire to return with your children to your cities and to your place, <b>go follow the tracks of the sheep</b>—direct your children with goodly instruction—in rectitude, fear of heaven, and propriety, so that they might hold fast to My service and faith and follow the practice of the patriarchs and shepherds rather than the nations’ laws, which are vain and deceitful. So Ezekiel expounds: “Cast away, every one of you, the detestable things that you are drawn to, and do not defile yourselves with the fetishes of Egypt. I am the Lord your God …” [20:7]. “Walk in My statutes …” [20:19]. Daniel promised that throughout this lengthy period of exile, Israel would observe Torah and hold fast to their faith, as it is written: “The enlightened will shine like the radiance of the firmament and those who lead the multitudes to righteousness will be like the stars forever” [Dan. 12:3]."
Commentary on Song of Songs 1:9:1,"<b>To a mare:</b> These are the words of the Glory. The figure refers to Pharaoh’s pursuit of Israel, the Glory and the Presence of Its might accompanying them, with his chariots and cavalry."

Commentary on Song of Songs 1:10:2,"The figure is that of the <i>shekhinah</i> leaving exile and entering the bridal chamber. Wreaths and strings of pearls are women’s jewelry, the ornaments of a bride."
Commentary on Song of Songs 1:11:1,"The parable conveys that both written and oral Torah are conveyed by the <i>shekhinah</i>. The two are compared to gold and silver: “I prefer the teaching You proclaimed to thousands of gold and silver pieces” [Ps. 119:72]. Similarly, they are compared to wine and milk, and honey and milk, as in “All who are thirsty, come for water … buy … wine and milk without cost” [Isa. 55:1]. And “Sweetness drops from your lips O bride; honey and milk are under your tongue” [Song of Songs 4:11]. That is to say that they are all the image and appearance: water from wind and fire from water. Because redness is closer to us, the verse gives precedence to the red. But the Holy One gives precedence to the white, as it says: “Mine is silver and mine is gold” [Hag. 2:8].<sup>54</sup><i class=""footnote""> “Wine,” “red,” and “gold” are symbols of the left side, while “white,” “milk,” and “silver” symbolize the right. Isa. 55:1, referring to human access, mentions wine before milk. The Haggai verse, referring to God, reverses the symbolic order: God prefers silver (<i>ḥesed</i>) to gold (<i>din</i>).</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 1:11:2,"<b>To your points of silver:</b> Oral Torah is emanated from the written and it sustains her, just as the spirit upholds the body. Thus written Torah has been compared to points [<i>nekudot</i>], since the vowels [<i>nekudot</i>] function among the consonants like the spirit in the body, as our sages say.<sup>55</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Ecclesiastes Rabbah 8:11, where R. Haninah interprets Zach. 12:1 “God created [<i>yatzar</i>] humanity’s spirit within it” as meaning that the spirit has been tied or bound up within the body in order to animate. See Chavel (cited on page 10 of the editor’s note above), note 39 <i>ad locum</i>.</i> Both Torahs, oral and written, were given through the <i>shekhinah</i> as they state in the Midrash to Psalms, “The Lord gives a command; the women who bring the news are a great host” [Ps. 68:12].<sup>56</sup><i class=""footnote""> Concerning this verse, the Midrash states: “As for the Holy One, blessed be He, His name and might, when He declaims in enunciated speech, the sound is divided into seven voices.” Divine speech creates the cosmogenerative septet ranging from <i>ḥesed</i> to the <i>shekhinah</i>. However, it only becomes audible, giving rise to the differentiated cosmos and producing prophetic discourse through the aegis of the <i>shekhinah</i>, the final rung in the chain of divine being.</i> From here it is clear that the innermost voice was not differentiated and rendered audible until it reached the end of the chain of emanation, the tenth <i>sefirah</i>."

Commentary on Song of Songs 1:11:4,"Now you have to know that which is taught in the Tractate <i>Berakhot</i><sup>57</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Berakhot</i> 6b.</i>: “Whoever partakes of a wedding-feast and does not make the bridegroom rejoice transgresses five ‘voices,’ as Scripture says: ‘The voice of gladness, the voice of joy, the voice of bridegroom and the voice of bride, a voice saying “Praise to the Lord”’ [Jer. 33:11], and so forth. And if one does give joy to the bridegroom, what is his reward? He attains Torah, which was given with five ‘voices,’ as its says: ‘It was morning on the third day and there were thunderings<sup>58</sup><i class=""footnote""> The term for “thunder” and “sound” throughout this passage is <i>kol</i>, the same as “voice” in the Jeremiah passage. The thunderbolts are the “voice” of God as Torah is given. From the reading of the Jeremiah passage it appears that the five “voices” are the five lower <i>sefirot</i> from <i>tiferet</i> to <i>malkhut</i>, or from bridegroom to bride.</i> … and the sound of the shofar …’ [Exod. 19:16]. ‘There was the sound of the shofar … and God responded in thunder’ [Exod. 19:19].” Is it true that there are five? Does it not also say: “And all the people saw the thunderbolts?” [Exod. 20:18].<sup>59</sup><i class=""footnote""> This might mean there were six or seven, thus breaking the parallel of five (wedding shouts) to five (Torah-sounds).

Commentary on Song of Songs 1:11:5,"Here they spoke of five voices. But we have also noted seven voices, those mentioned by King David in the Psalm [29]: “Render unto the Lord, O sons of gods!” Our sages have said that the divine Word was divided into seven voices.<sup>60</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> 28, end.</i>"

Commentary on Song of Songs 1:11:7,"Now you attune your ear and listen to my words, so that the words of the sages be fulfilled. That which Moses and all Israel attained on that occasion, when they saw eye to eye, was only five voices, no more. That is why they forced Rabbi Helbo to admit that “And all the people saw the thunderbolts” referred to previously heard voices. These five are the totality. Moses asked to attain more, but was not answered. These five voices contain all seven extensions of space.<sup>61</sup><i class=""footnote""> North, east, south, west, up, down, and inward. These will be associated below with the seven lower <i>sefirot</i>.</i> From them are derived the seventy divine names that are appointed over the seventy nations. Together with the innermost voice they comprise seventy-one. That innermost voice split [into seventy] as it addressed the seventy nations. Every nation heard the Word, and that is the “great voice that did not cease” [Deut. 5:19]. All this is compared to a hammer, whose power is one but which fragments the rock into multiple pieces. So the totality of all is five voices, their specification is seven, except for the innermost voice, parallel to the singular nation. Of this it says: “A great voice that did not cease.” But the one who refers to ten voices holds fast to the highest total, that of the ten <i>sefirot</i>. All these lead in the same direction, having been “given by a single shepherd” [Eccles. 12:11]."
Commentary on Song of Songs 1:12:1,"When the Glory resided upon its throne, this being the revelation at Sinai, the <i>shekhinah</i> said: <b>My nard gave forth its fragrance.</b> Israel desired to view God eye to eye, stating: “It is our desire to see our King!” They received a positive answer, as it is written: “He said to Moses: ‘Ascend to God’” [Exod. 24:1].

Corresponding to the intermediate angelic world, in which serve those angels whose authority is over the earth, is the tent of meeting, in which are situated the showbread table, the candelabrum and the golden altar, these being inner and spiritual vessels. The golden altar was not designated for wholly burnt offerings or sacrifices, but rather for the incense, which was a matter subtle and spiritual. Facing it was the candelabrum and the light from its six branches issuing as hammered work from its central branch, radiating light at the front of the lamp stand.

On the fifth day of creation: ‘… and birds that fly above the earth’ [Gen. 1:20] while in the Sanctuary: ‘Let there be cherubim with outstretched wings’ [Exod. 25:20]. Humanity was created on the sixth day. Concerning the sanctuary it states: ‘Bring forward Aaron your brother’ [Exod. 28:1]. On the seventh day: ‘The heaven and the earth were completed’ [Gen. 2:1]. Concerning the tabernacle: ‘Thus was completed all of the work of the Tabernacle …’ [Exod. 39:32].

Commentary on Song of Songs 3:8:3,The text begins to set forth the hierarchy of emanation.
Commentary on Song of Songs 3:9:1,"From the outpouring of Wisdom and its luminescence, He radiated light, and from it drew forth emanation. Concerning this it states in Genesis Rabbah [3:4]: “Whence was the light created? The Holy One, blessed be He, enwrapped Himself as in a robe, and radiated His luster from one end of the world to the other.” The robe designates the invocation of the emanation of wisdom which encompasses the totality of all things. The act of enwrapping conveys that He received radiance from that emanational outflow and literally sparked forth light. This is furthermore the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer the Great who said:"
Commentary on Song of Songs 3:9:2,"Whence were the heavens created? He took from the light of His garment; He wrapped Himself as in a robe. The light extended outwards, as it says: “wrapped in a robe of light, You spread the heavens like a tent cloth” [Ps. 104:2]. Whence was the earth created? God took hold of some of the snow underlying the Throne of Glory and cast it downwards. As it says: “He commands the snow: ‘Fall to the ground!’” [Job 37:6].<sup>88</sup><i class=""footnote""> Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer, 3. <i>Havei aretz</i>, “fall to the ground,” means literally “become ground.”</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 3:9:3,"This accords with the opinion of Plato, who argued that it was vain to believe that the Creator created something from nothing, but rather there was a preexistent matter. This is not the same as clay in the potter’s hands or the smith’s iron, who shape from them whatsoever they desire, so that the Creator, be He praised, shaped heaven and earth from primordial matter, but sometime might create something else of it. That God does not create something from nothing should not be considered a diminution of His power, just as there is no diminution in His inability to create logically impossible entities, such as a square whose diagonal is equal to its side or the simultaneous conjunction of two opposites. Just as in these cases, there is no diminution in His capacity, so too there is no denigration if He does not emanate something from nothing, but rather uses a primal element. For this too is included in the general category of impossibility. Solomon too spoke of this, revealing lucid wisdom and sound reasoning, through the aegis of the holy spirit of prophecy."
Commentary on Song of Songs 3:9:4,"<b>Of wood from Lebanon:</b> Thence originates the emanation of all, including the [sefirotic] existences.

Commentary on Song of Songs 3:11:2,"<b>The crown with which his mother crowned him on his wedding day:</b> The entire sefirotic edifice coheres and is unified and ascends towards infinity, nor does it suffer a departure of the holy spirit. The crown stands for the emanation of blessing and superabundance from the spirit of the living God designated as the mother in the Midrash to Proverbs,<sup>93</sup><i class=""footnote""> Midrash Mishle, ed. B. Wissocsky, p. 57.</i> in the Rabbis’ exegesis of “May your father and mother rejoice” [Prov. 23:25]. Rabbi Akiba states: “Even the Holy One, blessed be He, rejoiced in him, as Wisdom rejoiced in him. As it says: ‘Let your father rejoice’: this is the Holy One, blessed be He. ‘And your mother’: this is that wise woman of whom it is written: ‘You shall call understanding a mother’ [Prov. 2:3].” Consequently, blessing, sanctification and unification which draw energy from the negation of thought are designated as the diadem and crown. Our sages say in the Midrash to Psalms [19:2]: “The angel assigned to Israel’s prayers waits until her final congregation has prayed and weaves them into a crown for the Holy One. As it says: ‘Blessings alight upon the head of the righteous, the life of all worlds’ [Prov. 10:6].” For this reason, the sages ordained the Sanctus and blessing within the blessings attached to the recitation of the <i>shema</i>, and placed the unification of <i>shema</i> in close proximity to them. And they ordained that all three<sup>94</sup><i class=""footnote""> Sanctification [<i>kadosh</i>], blessing [<i>barukh</i>], and <i>shema‘</i>.</i> should be recited in the great Sanctus of the Additional Prayer. For these three enter under the rubric of the unity of divine Wisdom, Understanding and Knowledge, the emanational edifice containing the seven (lower) <i>sefirot</i>. Because all of the ten <i>sefirot</i> are included within the (upper) three: Wisdom, Knowledge, and Understanding, the three recitations of the Sanctus<sup>95</sup><i class=""footnote""> This could refer either to the threefold repetition of “Holy” or to the three <i>kedushot</i> of the daily morning service.</i> exist to unify them. Within their totality, all things are included. So we have found in the Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer:<sup>96</sup><i class=""footnote""> Chapter 3, end.</i> “The world was created with ten statements but these were included in three.

Jerusalem is compared to myrrh which is red, referring to the attribute of justice, as it says: “Within her righteousness dwells” [Isa. 1:21]. Mt.

The <i>shekhinah</i> was lovely, beautified by the Holy Spirit. Indeed, over all the glory hangs a canopy and crown.

Commentary on Song of Songs 4:11:1,<b>Honey and milk:</b> The allusion is to the two modalities of Torah (written and oral) and the fact that the <i>shekhinah</i> is situated between the two cherubim.
Commentary on Song of Songs 4:11:2,"<b>And the scent of your robes:</b> The robe is not an entity distinct from Her. Rather, it is the overflow of Wisdom’s brightness which surrounds her. Our Sages state in Genesis Rabbah [21:5] concerning the verse “I looked and saw a man dressed in linen” [Daniel 10:5]: “He was comparable to a snail whose shell is inseparable from his body.” Since Wisdom’s brightness, encompassing thirty-two paths, surrounds the Glory, as in “Your faithful ones surround You” [Ps. 89:8], it is called “the garment of God,” as it says: “You are garbed in splendor and majesty” [Ps. 104:1]."
Commentary on Song of Songs 4:11:3,"In order to fulfill the verse “You shall walk in His ways” [Deut. 28:9], Israel were commanded to wrap themselves in the <i>tallit</i>,<sup>101</sup><i class=""footnote""> Prayer shawl, a rectangular garment bearing fringes at its four corners.</i> which possesses thirty-two fringes. Concerning the <i>tallit</i> it is written: “You shall gaze upon them and remember all of God’s commandments” [Num. 15:39]. Now Wisdom encompasses, is endiademed and crowned<sup>102</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Me-‘uteret u-mukhteret</i>.</i> with six hundred and thirteen precious gems. For each of the thirty-two paths within is divisible into two portions: good and evil, the positive and negative commandments. This division finds allusion in the ten divine statements (revealed directly at Sinai) in the words “remember” and “keep” the Sabbath day.<sup>103</sup><i class=""footnote""> The two versions of the decalogue (Exod. 20 and Deut. 5) differ in the wording of the Sabbath command. Exodus says “Remember the Sabbath Day” and Deuteronomy says “keep.” These are taken to refer to positive and prohibitive aspects of Sabbath observance, and then generalized to refer to positive and negative commandments altogether. For kabbalists they also refer to the two <i>sefirot yesod</i> and <i>malkhut</i>.</i> Thus there are sixty-four paths. And as each and every one contains the ten [<i>sefirot</i>], their sum is six hundred and forty. If one deletes the twenty-seven letters of the Torah,<sup>104</sup><i class=""footnote""> Twenty-two plus the five final forms.</i> the final sum is six hundred and thirteen. Thus concerning the fringes, Scripture states: “You shall gaze upon them and remember all of God’s commandments” [Num. 15:39]. Therefore our sages said in the tractate <i>Shavuot</i>: “The precept of fringes equals all of the commandments.”<sup>105</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Nedarim</i> 25b.</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 4:11:4,"It is incumbent upon us to engage in a detailed enquiry concerning all of the commandments, to find an allusion pointing to them in the ten divine statements revealed at Sinai. This is comparable to the manner in which the sages of Israel sought an allusion in the Torah for every aspect of fundamental ethics and courtesy which was not included within its commandments. Thus our sages<sup>106</sup><i class=""footnote""> In b. <i>Ta‘anit</i> 9a.</i> stated that R. Yohanan encountered a child who was reciting: “A man’s folly subverts his way and his heart rages against the Lord” [Prov. 19:3]. He said: “Does Scripture<sup>107</sup><i class=""footnote""> The prophetic and hagiographic sections of the Bible.</i> contain anything which is not already intimated in the Torah? An allusion to this indeed appears in the Torah. Their hearts sank; and, trembling, they turned to one another, saying, ‘What is this that God has done to us?’ [Gen. 42:28]. How much the more so should we say concerning the fundamentals of the Torah and its precepts that there is no doubt that the six hundred and thirteen commandments find their allusion in that divine voice described as ‘a great voice, which went on no more’ [Deut.5:19].”<sup>108</sup><i class=""footnote""> And thus everything must be included within it. Alternatively the concluding phrase <i>ve-lo’ yasaf</i> can be understood as “and He added nothing [further].”</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 4:11:5,"We should interpret each and every commandment in accord with our path, determining from which <i>sefirah</i> it derives and finding allusion to all of the reasons for the commandments which are not explicitly stated in the Torah. The reasons of many precepts are indeed explicated, an example being the law concerning the first born: “When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the Lord slew every first-born in the land of Egypt, the first-born of man and beast. Therefore I sacrifice to the Lord every first male issue of the womb, but redeem every first-born among my sons” [Exod. 13:15]. A similar case is that of tithes: “You shall consume the tithes of your new grain … before the Lord” which concludes “so that you might learn to revere the Lord your God forever” [Deut. 14:23]. Like these are many other commandments whose meaning is explained. But there are many whose purpose are not explicated, such as the reason for sacrifice, the Sabbatical year and Jubilee, circumcision, the blowing of the ram’s horn at New Year’s, forbidden acts of sexual union, oaths, vows and phylacteries, ritual fringes, Naziriteship, the palmfrond and citron, the ban on the consumption of the produce of fruit-bearing trees during their first three harvest years, the mixing of seeds in a field, the sacrifice of the red heifer, and many others, excluding those whose meaning is hinted at where they are mentioned."
Commentary on Song of Songs 4:11:6,"You should realize that all of the precepts depend upon two fundamental principles: the positive and negative commandments. The positive commandments are born of the quality of remembrance [<i>zakhor</i>]; the negative commandments of the quality of observance [<i>shamor</i>]. It is also well known that remembrance and observance correspond to two of the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He. Consequently, an individual who performs the command of his master and fulfills it, does so as a consequence of the quality of love. This constitutes the highest degree [of service] and the most excellent virtue, and corresponds to the category of positive commandments. An individual who desists from performing a deed out of fear of his master, does so as a consequence of the quality of awe. This stands on a lower rung than the quality of love, just as negative commandments occupy a gradation lower than the positive. For the person who fulfills the command of his master with his body and his possessions is not to be likened to one who is scrupulous about desisting from evil out of fear of him. Thus our Sages say: “Concerning what situation were these matters related? Concerning negative commandments. That is to say that the transgressor is smitten with forty lashes. However, with respect to positive commandments, such as the case when they instruct him to construct a Sukkah but he does not build it, or take a palm frond but he does not do so, they smite him until his soul departs his body.”<sup>109</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Ketubot</i> 86a. The two examples given refer to the commandments of the <i>Sukkot</i> festival, but could be any positive commandments of the Torah.</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 4:11:7,"All of the above derives from the principles of “remembrance” and “observance,” for the quality of remembrance occupies a gradation higher than that of observance and the branches which derive from it are in its likeness. Since Abraham our father took divine love as his portion, corresponding to remembrance, and he knew God’s name with a true and real knowledge, the Omnipresent One called him “My lover.” Nor is the [attainment of the] quality of love possible save through perfect knowledge. Thus one finds that many principles of the negative commandments are derived from the positive. For the quality of love exists within the quality of awe, since awe derives from love and is thus included within it."
Commentary on Song of Songs 4:11:8,"You should know that a human being, by nature and the process of generation, contains and is impressed with the stamp of these two qualities, that is to say the essential force of the positive and negative commandments, that is water and fire, the former at his right hand, the latter at his left. This is as our sages said: “Two angels escort an individual, one good and one evil.”<sup>110</sup><i class=""footnote""> Shabbat 119b.</i> And as that wise man said: “A wise man’s heart tends towards the right hand, a fool’s to the left” [Eccles. 10:2]. It is the truth that right conduct and the inclination to good are on the right while evil behavior and the inclination towards wickedness are on the left, as is the Accuser. Concerning this David said: “I am ever mindful of the Lord’s presence; He is at my right hand, I shall never be shaken” [Ps. 16:8]. “I shall not be shaken”: I shall never neglect, even for an instant, that inclination towards the good that stands at my right hand."
Commentary on Song of Songs 4:11:9,"Since these two qualities, the inclination to the good and the inclination to evil, which correspond to the positive and negative commandments, are impressed upon human nature, the Torah was given with positive and negative commandments to direct an individual and habituate him towards positive qualities. The inclination towards evil would be drawn after the good and annihilated within it. Concerning this our sages said: “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart’ [Deut. 6:5]—with your two inclinations, towards good and evil.”<sup>111</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Berakhot</i> 54a.</i> This is the purpose of the commandments, the acts of worship, prayers, and fasting. They serve to subjugate the evil inclination so that it might be rendered subordinate to the impulse towards good. Thus the body, whose foundation is dust and nature evil and which descends below, will be drawn after the faculty of the soul, whose foundation is life, whose nature is wholly for the good and ascends upwards. Give careful heed and listen to my wondrous words, let them always be present before your eyes, for they are pleasant and should be stored inside you."
Commentary on Song of Songs 4:11:10,"[There ensues a listing of the six hundred and thirteen commandments, as derived from the ten. See Chavel’s edition of the Hebrew text in <i>Kitvey RaMBaN</i> II, pp. 521–48. The concluding summary of that discussion follows.]"
Commentary on Song of Songs 4:11:11,"These<sup>112</sup><i class=""footnote""> The following, down to the resumption of the commentary with 4:12, is found on p. 548 of Chavel’s Hebrew edition.</i> are the six hundred and thirteen commandments, positive and negative, derived from the ten commandments as “Remember” and “Observe.” Of this our rabbis said: “‘Remember’ and ‘Observe’ were proclaimed in a single utterance, something no mouth could speak nor any ear hear.”<sup>113</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a.</i> No one voice could simultaneously speak two things, opposite to one another, positive and negative; such is beyond the capacity of the human mouth or ear. He explained the two hundred forty-eight positive commandments guiding the human limbs,<sup>114</sup><i class=""footnote""> Also said to number 248, according to a Talmudic source (<i>Makkot</i> 23b).</i> which number two hundred forty-eight, in a goodly and upright path, thus purifying, cleansing, and sanctifying the person that he might resemble his Maker. The remaining three hundred sixty-five commandments guide the sinews, which are of that number, in a goodly and upright way, keeping the person from evil paths and ugly qualities. Thus body and soul will be on a single path in harmony with one another."
Commentary on Song of Songs 4:11:12,"You should know that the Torah is entirely clear, spoken by the divine dynamis,<sup>115</sup><i class=""footnote""> Or: from the mouth of <i>gevurah</i>, the God of power.</i> containing not a single letter or vowel point that is not needed. All of it is a divine structure, hewn out in the name<sup>116</sup><i class=""footnote""> Perhaps should read: “hewn out of”; <i>mi-shemo</i> rather than <i>bi-shemo</i>.</i> of the blessed Holy One. There is no difference between “Timna was the concubine of Eliphaz” [Gen. 36:12] or “the chieftain of Magdiel, the chieftan of Eram” [Gen. 36:43] and the ten commandments or “Hear O Israel” [Deut. 6:4]. Whoever deletes a single letter is like one who deletes God’s whole name and a whole world. Therefore it was necessary that the letters and words be counted, that <i>plene</i> and <i>lene</i><sup>117</sup><i class=""footnote""> “Full” and “lacking,” two ways of spelling Hebrew words.</i> spellings be recorded, forms written but not pronounced, as well as forms pronounced but not written, open and closed beginnings of sections [i.e., paragraph divisions], larger and smaller letters.

Commentary on Song of Songs 4:11:13,"Because the commandments are the very body of purity and holiness, and the one concerned with them becomes purified and holy, Scripture said <b>the fragrance of your garments is like that of Lebanon,</b><sup>120</sup><i class=""footnote""> Deriving “Lebanon” from <i>libbun</i>, “cleansing.”</i> for that fragrance is the life of both worlds."
Commentary on Song of Songs 4:12:1,"<b>A garden locked is my own, my bride:</b> The <i>shekhinah</i> is compared to a garden, since a person plants and fences it, bringing in water to irrigate it and producing all manner of lovely herbiage and plants. The <i>shekhinah</i>’s fence is the cherubim, the plants are the seventy nations, the trees are the angels. All these are supplied by that spring which proceeds from Wisdom’s paradise, within which souls flower in joy. It flows forth without ceasing either day or night; on its account the world is sustained. As our sages said in tractate Yoma:<sup>121</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Yoma</i> 38b.</i> “On account of the righteous one is the world created and sustained,” as it says: “The righteous one is the world’s foundation” [Prov. 10:25].<sup>122</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Zaddik</i> or “the righteous” is <i>yesod</i>, the source of sefirotic energy as it flows into the <i>shekhinah</i>.</i> Our sages also said concerning this: “The circumference of the tree of life is a journey of five hundred years and all of the waters of creation are divided forth from it.” Rabbi Yehudah said: “It is not the circumference of its bough, but its trunk that constitutes a journey of five hundred years.”<sup>123</sup><i class=""footnote""> Genesis Rabbah 15:7.</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 4:12:2,"“A river goes forth from Eden to water the garden” [Gen. 2:10]. The garden constitutes the beginning of the differentiated universe. As it says: “from there it divides and becomes four branches” [ibid.]. The verse is in present tense, the process is eternal. Thus it says: “There is a river whose streams gladden God’s city, the holy dwelling-place of the Most High” [Ps. 46:5]. And “You make springs gush forth in torrents; they make their way between the hills, giving drink to all the wild beasts” [Ps. 104:10–11]."
Commentary on Song of Songs 4:12:3,"Concerning this spring, it states: “a garden spring, a well of fresh water, flowing streams from Lebanon” [Cant. 4:15]. Our Sages of blessed memory said: “‘a garden spring’: this is Jacob who is a spring for the garden. ‘A well of fresh water’: this is Isaac. ‘Flowing streams’: this is Abraham.”<sup>124</sup><i class=""footnote""> No such interpretation is found in the extant rabbinic sources.

Commentary on Song of Songs 4:12:4,"Contemplate the wonders of this symbolism and you will know and understand what our Sages wrote, the manner in which their words constitute the height of completeness and perfection. Such truly befits sages like these, whose every word was uttered through the holy spirit in allegoric allusion, so as to arouse the consciousness of the Kabbalistic illuminati, rather than the fools, idiots, and confused who treat their words as if they were fox fables! Thus we find in the tractate Sanhedrin: “‘As I looked upon, thrones were set down …’ [Dan. 7:9]—one for God and one for David: these are the words of R. Akiba. R. Yose the Galilean said to him: ‘Akiba, how long are you going to profane the <i>shekhinah</i>!? Rather, one throne is for justice and one is for righteousness.’ R. Elazar b. Azaryah said to Akiba: ‘What are you doing occupying yourself with words of <i>aggadah</i>!? Desist from your discourse and occupy yourself with the laws of leprosy and tents.<sup>126</sup><i class=""footnote""> Return to your safe haven of halakhic expertise.</i> Rather one is a throne and one is for a footstool: a throne upon which to sit, a footstool to rest the feet.’”<sup>127</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 38b.</i> Surely these sages had no essential argument with one another, but they differed on whether it was appropriate to reveal the secret meaning.

Commentary on Song of Songs 4:16:3,"Concerning this our sages stated allusively: “‘Awake, O north wind’—this is the holocaust offering slaughtered on the northern side of the altar. ‘Come, O south wind’—these are the whole offerings slaughtered on the southern side of the altar. ‘That its perfume might spread’: this is incense. ‘Let my beloved come to his garden’: this is the <i>shekhinah</i>. ‘And enjoy its luscious fruits’: these are the sacrifices.”<sup>132</sup><i class=""footnote""> Cant.

Commentary on Song of Songs 4:16:4,"<b>And enjoy its luscious fruits:</b> This is the sifted flour refined of its waste matter. In accordance with this theme it is said: “An offering by fire, of pleasing odor to the Lord” [Lev. 1:17]. Our sages say in <i>Torat Kohanim</i>: “‘An offering’: it must be specifically for an offering.” This refers to the tenth <i>Sefirah</i> [the <i>shekhinah</i>] which ascends above to the place of its origin.<sup>133</sup><i class=""footnote""> Literally “an ascent for ascent.” Or “an ascent unto the Name.”</i> “‘By fire’: for the sake of the fires.” Our master, the Hasid of blessed memory,<sup>134</sup><i class=""footnote""> The reference is to R.

Commentary on Song of Songs 4:16:5,"The intent of the sacrifice is to provide sustenance to each and every divine attribute. This was the intent of the princes of Israel when they offered twelve goats, twelve rams, twelve lambs for a burnt offering, and twelve billy goats for a sin offering when the altar was consecrated. Everything is transmuted into spirit via the sefirotic channels which number twelve. And twenty-four bullocks were offered as sacrifices of well being, corresponding to the power of the left side of divinity, the aspect of Might, which is twenty-four [<span dir=""rtl"">ד״כ</span>], as it is written: “I will lay carbuncles [<i>kadkod</i>] as your foundation stones” [Isa. 54:12]. This alludes to the twenty-four permutations of the divine name <i>Adonai</i>. The sacrifices of well-being constituted sixty rams, sixty billy goats, and sixty yearling lambs [Num. 7:88]. These correspond to the sixty steps, the sixty heroes [Cant. 3:7], and the three-score queens [Cant. 6:8]. The meaning of a pleasing [<i>niḥoaḥ</i>] aroma is that of descent, the Aramaic of descent [<i>yarad</i>] being <i>naḥat</i>. Through the sacrifice, divine spirit descends and the force of holiness unites and is drawn into close continguity within the channels. For this reason, sacrifice is designated <i>korban</i>. This is the meaning of “Let my beloved come to his garden and enjoy its luscious fruits.”"

Forty years after the Temple was built, prophetic vision was sealed. As our sages state in <i>Seder Olam:</i> “Alexander, king of Macedonia, reigned twelve years and died.” Until this time the prophets prophesied through the holy spirit. From this time onwards, “Incline your ears and listen to the sages’ words” [Prov. 22:17]. As our Sages said in tractate Yoma: “Why is it written: ‘rebuild the House, then I will look on it with favor and I will glorify it’ [Haggai 1:8] where the transmitted text states ‘I will be glorified.’<sup>138</sup><i class=""footnote""> We are dealing with <i>ketiv/keri</i>—the written text is <i>akhabed</i> (I will be glorified) but it is pronounced <i>akhabdah</i> (I will glorify it).

Commentary on Song of Songs 5:7:1,"<b></b> Consequently, upon the departure of the <i>shekhinah</i>, many and horrific troubles befell me, caused by the watchmen patrolling the town. These are the seventy angels who surround God’s Throne of Glory; through them harsh decrees enter the world. As it states in the Chapters of R. Eliezer [chap. 24] concerning: “‘Let us, then, go down and confound their speech …’ [Gen. 11:7]. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the angels surrounding His Throne of Glory: ‘let us go and confound their speech.’” They are similarly called <i>shomrei homot:</i> “the guards of the walls.” This passage is a parable for the evil decrees and persecutions which befell the Jewish people during the period of the Second Temple by the hands of the Greeks."
Commentary on Song of Songs 5:7:2,"One thing you need to know is that a decree was enacted that Israel would be subjugated to four kingdoms, not counting the period of servitude in Egypt, for Israel was not yet a people and not designated as the people of God until they entered the land and constructed the Temple. These four nations were revealed to our father Abraham during “the covenant between the pieces” [Gen. 15], just as they were shown to Daniel.<sup>140</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Daniel 8.</i> The three year old calf of Abraham’s vision is the kingdom of Babylon, that is to say Nebuchadnezzar its king; the three-year old goat is Greece, that is, Alexander the Macedonian, and he is the ram [<i>tzfir ‘izim</i>] mentioned in Daniel [8:4]. The turtledove represents Rome, also known as Edom."
Commentary on Song of Songs 5:7:3,"The kingdom of Babylon is referred to as being threefold because three kings arose from it: Nebuchadnezzar, Ebel Merodach, and Balshezzar. Thus it is written in Jeremiah [27:7]: “All of the nations shall serve him, his son and grandson, until the turn of his own land comes, when many nations and great kings shall subjugate him.” Greece is referred to as a three-year old goat because Alexander was the king of the north who conquered the other three directions of the world and governed them just as Nebuchadnezzar had ruled the entire world. As it is written: “raising from their thrones, all of the kings of the nations” [Isa. 14:9]. The three-year old ram represents the Medeans, these being the kings of Assyria, Cyrus and Darius. As it is written: “They joyfully celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days, for the Lord had given them cause for joy by inclining the heart of the Assyrian king toward them so as to give them the support in the work of the House of God, the God of Israel” [Ezra 6:22]. Because they were Shem’s descendants, they merited that the Temple be constructed on their account, and it was not destroyed by the hand of Senacherib."
Commentary on Song of Songs 5:7:4,"Scripture refers to them as a three-year old [ram] for they were the kings of the east, who conquered the other three directions of the world. As we find in Isaiah [46:11]: “I summoned that swooping bird from the east” and “Who has roused a victor from the east?” [Isa. 41:2]<sup>141</sup><i class=""footnote""> The verses refer to Cyrus.</i> He conquered the three remaining directions of the world, as it states: “I saw a ram butting westward, northward, and southward” [Dan. 8:4]. And it says: “So says Cyrus, the king of Persia: ‘The Lord, God of heaven, has granted me all of the kingdoms of the world’” [II Chron. 36:23]. The turtledove represents the wicked one, the fourth awful and mighty beast viewed by Daniel. He desired to comprehend its true meaning, as it is written: “I approached one of the attendants and asked him the true meaning of all of this” [Daniel 7:16]. It is said concerning this beast: “it will devour the whole earth, tread it down and crush it.” R. Yohanan said: “It is requisite that Rome’s nature spread throughout the entire world.”<sup>142</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 2b. “Rome” and “Edom” for the medieval Jews refer to Christendom, which they view as a continuation of the Roman empire.</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 5:7:5,"Israel underwent subjugation to these nations in accord with the following order. Senacherib, king of Assyria, who was also king of Medea, exiled the ten tribes. “He settled them in Halah, along the Habor [and] the river Gozan, and in the towns of Media” [II Kings 18:11]. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, at the appointed time, exiled Judah and Benjamin. Isaiah the prophet forecast the downfall of Babylon by the hands of the Medeans, just as he forecasted Cyrus’ command for Israel’s manumission. “Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who do not value silver or delight in gold” [Isa. 13:17]. At the prophecy’s conclusion he states: “And when the Lord has given you rest from your sorrow and trouble, and from the hard service that you were made to serve, you shall recite this song of scorn over the king of Babylon” [Isa. 14:3–4]. Then follows the song’s content until it comes to its conclusion “I will rise up against them … and will wipe out of Babylon name and remnant, kith and kin …” [Isa. 14:22]. Isaiah similarly prophesied regarding Cyrus’ decree concerning Israel: “So says the Lord to Cyrus His anointed, whose right hand I strengthened” [Isa. 45:1], “He will build my city” [Isa. 45:13]. We find similarly in Daniel [5:30–6:1]: “During that very night Belshazzar the King was killed and Darius the Mede received the kingdom.” He reigned one year to complete the seventy years apportioned to the sovereignty of Babylon.<sup>143</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Megillah 12a.</i> During the first year of Cyrus’ reign, the decree concerning Israel was issued and Israel came under the jurisdiction of the kingdom of Medea. Afterwards, the kingdom of Greece arose, that is, Alexander the Macedonian, the three-year old goat and Daniel’s <i>tzfir ‘izim</i>.<sup>144</sup><i class=""footnote""> See p. 96 above.</i> He fought with the ram [Dan. 8:7], these being the kings of Medea, Darius the Persian, putting him to the sword, as it is written: “There was no one to rescue the ram from his power” [Dan. 8:7]. Israel, both those in Babylon and those in Jerusalem during the period of the second Temple, came under the rule of the king of Greece. The rule of the kings of Greece lasted one hundred and eighty years, as it states in the tractate <i>Avodah Zarah</i> [9a]. At that time war broke out between Greece and Rome, as our sages taught in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> [8b]: “The Romans engaged in thirty-two battles with Greeks and were not able to overcome them until Israel allied itself with Rome.” Israel revolted against the Greeks during the period of the second Temple, coming under Roman authority and keeping faithful alliance with them for twenty-six years. Then the Romans turned against them, destroyed the second Temple, and the kingdom of Greece was subjugated by the Romans. Nor will the son of David come until the dominion of the kingdom of Rome spreads over the entire world for nine months, just as the other three kingdoms spread over the entire world. For this reason, our sages ordained the drinking of four cups of wine,<sup>145</sup><i class=""footnote""> On the eve of Passover, celebrating the first redemption but anticipating the last.</i> corresponding to the four terms for redemption appearing in the pericope <i>Va‘era</i> [Exod. 6:6–7], conveying the glad tidings to Israel that they will go forth from their subjugation to the four kingdoms."
Commentary on Song of Songs 5:7:6,"I have written all of this because I have seen an interpretation in Genesis Rabbah in which the three-year old goat is correlated with the kingdom of Greece, with the two-horned ram appearing in Daniel [8:3] brought as corroborating evidence. This seems to me to be either a mistake or a case of scribal error, for it is clearly stated in Daniel that the two-horned ram represents the kings of Medea and Persia."
Commentary on Song of Songs 5:7:7,"I have also seen someone dispute the words of our Sages and state that the fourth beast shown to Daniel represents the kingdom of Ishmael, for they have expanded throughout the majority of the inhabited world, their kingdom being great and widespread. They find it difficult to refer to Greece [and Rome] as representing two kingdoms when they really are one nation. Thus it states: “the offspring of Greece [<i>Yavan</i>] are Elisha, Tarshish and the Kittim” [Gen. 10:4]. The Kittim are the Romans. So we find in the first chapter of Josippon:<sup>146</sup><i class=""footnote""> The popular medieval Hebrew adaptation of Josephus’s <i>History of the Jews</i>.</i> “And Sappho the son of Eliphaz ruled there.” If this is the case, the Greeks and the Romans constitute one people. All of this is found in his commentary to the Pentateuch and also at the conclusion of the pericope Balak, concerning the verse: “Ships come from the quarter of Kittim” [Num. 24:24]."
Commentary on Song of Songs 5:7:8,"The essential interpretation is in accord with the words of our sages. Since the verse mentioned the kingdom of Babylon, it has already mentioned Ishmael, for Babylon stands at their head; all are under its dominion and conform to its discipline.<sup>147</sup><i class=""footnote""> Babylon equals Baghdad, the capital of Islam.</i> Furthermore, although the Greeks and Romans constitute one ethnos, they are two distinct kingdoms, and in the past they engaged in war with one another. Similarly, the kings of Judah and Israel were one people who split into two kingdoms."
Commentary on Song of Songs 5:7:9,"It is said in Daniel [7:25] concerning the fourth beast: “He will speak words against the Most High,” that is, he will say words that can not conceivably be said: “these are my words.”<sup>148</sup><i class=""footnote""> This would seem to be Christianity’s appropriation of Jewish scripture. There has been considerable censorship of the manuscript in the following lines.</i> “And he will harass the holy ones of the Most High” [Dan. 7:25]: Israel. This is the meaning of “in the presence of the vengeful foe” [Ps. 44:17]. “He will think of changing times and laws” [7:25]: in their interpretation and to change the law. “And they will be delivered into his hands for time, times and half a time” [Dan. 7:25]: that is to say that redemption will not come to Israel until “time, times and half a time.” As it is said: “the beast was killed … its body was destroyed and it was consigned to the flames” [Dan. 7:11].

Commentary on Song of Songs 6:2:1,"<b>My beloved has gone down to his garden:</b> An all-encompassing entity does not differentiate between such distinctions as “above” and “below.” Descent is equivalent to ascent; ascent to descent. Because exile has caused it to be occulted amidst its sefirotic manifestations, Scripture refers to it as engaging in an act of “descent.”<sup>155</sup><i class=""footnote""> A radically different and ironic reading.

Commentary on Song of Songs 6:2:4,"<b>And to gather the lilies:</b> This is Thought, the luminescence of Wisdom flowing forth to the six cosmic boundaries [<i>ketzavot</i>]. All this takes place during the period of exile, a time bereft of festal offerings, sacrifices of thanksgiving and the meal offerings. The spiritual entities ascend and are drawn to that place from which they nurse. This is the meaning of: “on evil’s account, the righteous one dies” [Isa. 57:1].<sup>157</sup><i class=""footnote""> Because of this cosmic exile, the <i>sefirot</i> turn “upward” and <i>tzaddik</i>, the righteous one [<i>yesod</i>] is not nourished by them.</i> For this reason, one must strive to invoke and emanate an outflow of blessing to the Fathers,<sup>158</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ḥesed, gevurah, tiferet</i>, symbolized by the Patriarchs.</i> so that the sons too be imbued with emanative energy. In this verse this process of emanation and outpouring is referred to as “gathering.”"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:2:5,"Our sages have likewise referred to the emanation of the <i>sefirot</i> and their revelation as an act of displacement [<i>‘akirah</i>]. It states in Genesis Rabbah [15:1]: “‘The Lord God planted a garden in Eden’ [Gen. 2:8]. As it is written: ‘Let the trees of the Lord be sated, the cedars of Lebanon, his own planting’ [Ps. 104:16]. R. Hanina said: ‘They were like the antennae of locusts [<i>karnei hagavim</i>]. The Holy One uprooted them and replanted them in the Garden of Eden.’” Comprehend this wondrous statement. The planter must have in his hands a plantling. Similarly, the emanation and manifestation of the divine entities [<i>havayot</i>] was like an act of “displacement” while their creation and nurturance in their respective places was an act of planting. Those who plant “seedlings lovingly attended”<sup>159</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Neta sha ‘ashuim</i>, after Isa. 5:7.</i> need to water them regularly. This is the meaning of R. Haninah’s statement. It states further in the Midrash: “Let the trees of the Lord drink and be sated” [Ps. 104:16]: “May their lives be sated; may their waters be sated; may their planting be sated.” The meaning here is that each sefirotic power receives its energy from the power above it, life drawing from the source of life, water from life, and the plantlings drawing from water. All this is intimated here. And it is also germane to the next verse which states:"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:3:1,"The meaning is that I receive from my beloved and my beloved, who browses among the lilies, receives [its energy] from transcendent Wisdom. Each and every sefirotic power ascends and “gazes” upon the power surmounting it, each attribute drawing forth from attribute, that which is carved out from that which is engraved, that which is engraved from that which is traced, that which is traced from that which is concealed. All are within each other, all derive from each other, all are connected to each other and bound to one another."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:4:1,"This entire verse constitutes a parable concerning Wisdom, and is to be read in accord with the principle which we enunciated at the book’s beginning."

This is the gist of the psalm."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:4,"[104:2]: “You … are wrapped in a robe of light” corresponds to the light created on the first day of creation. That is, the emanation of that light from Nothing."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:5,"[104:3]: “He sets His rafters in the waters” corresponds to the command “Let there be a firmament” created on the second day to “separate water from water” [Gen. 1:6].

Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:6,[104:5]: “He established the earth on its foundations so that it shall never totter” parallels “Let the waters be gathered into one place and let dry land appear” [Gen. 1:9] and designates the length of time established for its existence.

Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:16,"[104:1] “O Lord my God, You are very great”: The psalm alludes to the illumination of Wisdom, extending in every direction. From that flow, each Cause and attribute nurses like an infant."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:17,"“Enclothed in glory and majesty”: So is Wisdom bounded. Never will we find Her in Your absence. Thus it was prior to the world’s creation, when the Holy One was alone in His world, when the primal existences [<i>havayot</i>] were still deeply hidden within Wisdom."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:18,"The text then explicates the manner of the creation of the two worlds, above and below."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:19,"[104:2]: “Wrapped in a robe of light; You spread the heavens like a tent cloth”: This denotes the invocation of Wisdom’s emanation enveloping the entirety of being. “Enwrapment” means that it receives illumination from that flow. Its amplification sparked a light which was among the ten entities emanated upon that first day, all as one, without differentiation. These are: heaven and earth; primeval chaos—formless and void, darkness and light, water and wind, the quality of day and the quality of night.<sup>162</sup><i class=""footnote""> The author is linking the ten <i>sefirot</i> of the upper world to these ten attributes which, according to the Talmud [<i>Ḥagigah</i> 12a], underlay the creation of this world. They are heaven, earth, formlessness, void, darkness, light, water, wind, day, and night. This is one of several such lists of primordial entities to be found in rabbinic sources.</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:20,"And thus [Gen. 1:2 states]: “The world was chaotic, empty”: Chaos is an entity lacking all form; but primal Emptiness enclothed that chaos, until it traced a tracing finer than spirit. “Darkness was upon the face of the deep”: The depth of the supernal heights, the depth below.<sup>163</sup><i class=""footnote""> The depth above: <i>omek rom</i> = <i>keter; omek tahat</i> = <i>malkhut</i>. See the Commentary of R. Azriel to <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> 1:5.</i> “And the spirit of God hovered over the waters”: The Messiah’s spirit, the spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, hovered over the waters, covering all. This is all that was emanated upon that first day."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:21,"The essence of all things was emanated upon the first day, just as our Sages taught concerning the primordial human: “In the first hour of the day the dust from which he was created was gathered together.”<sup>164</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 38b.</i> When Scripture states: “Let there be light” [Gen. 1:3] its meaning is that Divinity enwrapped Itself in that light as we have explained, meaning that through the amplification of that luminescence, the light entered into a state of actualization."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:22,"In this first passage we find the word “light” five times, just as the phrase “it was good” appears five times. In the second passage the term “water” is repeated five times. Five were the drops of water, five were the drops of light in their midst. These were the five voices uttered at Torah’s revelation.<sup>165</sup><i class=""footnote""> See comments to Canticles 1:8.</i> It is for this reason that Scripture states, “it was good,” for the light was kindled candle from candle, granting the primal essences the power to expand and flow forth."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:23,"“God separated the light from the darkness” [Gen. 1:4]: God set a boundary to the effluence and expansion of each and every one. This is the intent of “Let there be light and there was light” [Gen. 1:3], meaning “the speculum that shines.” “And there was darkness” [Gen. 1:2]: “the speculum that does not shine.”"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:24,"Concerning both of them it said: “It was good.” This is the meaning of: “God called the light day, the darkness He called night” [Gen. 1:5]. He drew forth the effluence of the attribute of Day to daytime, the attribute of Night to nighttime. “And there was one day” [Gen. 1:5] all remained unified, in all of this the primal essence came to manifestation. Another interpretation: “There was evening”: the speculum that does not shine. “There was morning”: the speculum which does shine. “One day”: unique and unified in His names."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:25,[Ps. 104:3]: “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters” [Gen. 1:6] parallels: “Who lays the beams of Your Upper chambers in the waters.”
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:26,"“Let there be a firmament”: let the firmament expand into the midst of the waters, like the expansion of the soul into form. On the second day, God created the boundaries of space. For this reason, Scripture did not state “it was good” on the second day. For the work of the divine attribute of goodness remained incomplete. Such is the meaning of: “Let the firmament divide the waters from the waters.” The basic act of separation is this division into two: the upper waters and the lower waters. The upper waters are allegorically designated as male: the lower waters as female. This division works out in multifarious details. Consequently, Scripture states: “He builds His upper chambers in the heaven” [Amos 9:6]. For they are constructed as rungs upon rungs, as it is written: “For one higher above the higher, watches” [Eccles. 5:7]. All of these entities are traced, one within the other, each encompassing the other. Thus half of the waters are on high, half are below. So it is said: “Just as the <i>shekhinah</i> is above, is the <i>shekhinah</i> below.”<sup>166</sup><i class=""footnote""> This quotation is not found in the extant rabbinic sources.</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:27,"Corresponding to this matter there are eighteen thousand worlds.<sup>167</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3b.</i> As David the King states: “God’s chariots are myriads, even thousands upon thousands” [Ps. 68:18]. Having stipulated that God’s chariots are myriads, that is twenty thousand worlds, corresponding to ten <i>sefirot</i> above and ten below, he subtracts two thousand from their number, for they are the nought. All of the above is true. The worlds number twenty thousand. But two thousand are not included in the count, for they are Nought. Each and every world consists of a thousand generations. There are consequently eighteen thousand worlds. The primal essences originate in the mystery of Wisdom and its Cause. For this reason, it is fitting that the phrase “God said” appears but nine times in the narrative of Creation. The tenth is an allusion to the Nought. It appears in the phrase “In the beginning.” It is proper that it not be enunciated."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:28,"“Who makes the clouds His riding-mount”: The total of divisions wrought in the upper waters is seventy, excepting that at the center, which makes them seventy-one. Facing them are the lower waters, stamped in their image yet considered but one, leading to a total of seventy-two. This is the meaning of “clouds,”<sup>168</sup><i class=""footnote""> “Cloud [<i>‘av</i>] is numerically 72.</i> as in “Behold the Lord rides upon a light cloud” [Isa. 19:1] or “Behold I come unto you in a dense cloud” [Exod. 19:9]."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:29,"The seventy divisions are the five “voices” divided into seven directions, excepting the central one that gives stability to them all and is not one of them. Actually there are six directions, each of them multiplied by ten. That is why “it was good” is said six times in the chapter on creation. This too is why Scripture speaks of “sixty queens” [Cant. 6:1] and “sixty warriors surround it” [Cant. 3:7]. All of this refers to a single matter, as we are to explain. Counting the seventh [central] direction also as ten, they make up seventy. Adding the innermost spiritual direction they are seventy-one. This is the totality of distinctions made on the second day."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:30,Each setting of limits is in fact a division of space. Thus it says of man’s creation that in the second hour He “limited” him. This is like a person who is building up a ruined place; he needs to trace out where he will put the upper stories and the chambers. The building is completed by means of these divisions. That is why division exists.
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:31,"“He walks upon the wings of the winds”: The blessed Holy One is revealed in and is raised up through the world. His footsteps are known through those attributes, just as the soul’s action is revealed through the body. This is the meaning of “God called the firmament heaven” [Gen. 1:5]. All the names are included in the word “heaven.” Thus Scripture says: “And you hear, O heaven” [II Chron. 6:27], “the Lord, God of heaven” [Neh. 1:8], “He who rides in heaven” [Deut. 33:26]."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:32,"[Ps. 104:4]: “He makes the winds His messengers”: This alludes to the fact that the angels were created on the second day. These are His hosts on whose account He is designated the “God of hosts.” For they are neither replaced nor annihilated as are the other angels created on the fifth day, as we shall explain."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:33,"[Ps. 104:10]: “You make springs gush forth in torrents, they make their way between the hills” corresponds to “Let the water below the sky be gathered into one area, so that dry land may appear” [Gen. 1:9].<sup>169</sup><i class=""footnote""> The gathering of the waters and the appearance of dry land occurs on the third day of creation.</i> This is the preparation of the channels leading into the sea of Wisdom.<sup>170</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Malkhut</i>.</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:34,"[Ps. 104:5]: “He established the earth upon its foundations” indicates that the separation became truly distinct and visible. Therefore, it is in this place that the verse repeats “God saw that it was good” instead of on the second day. Just as our sages said concerning the creation of the primordial human, “God shaped his limbs in the third hour,”<sup>171</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 38b.</i> similarly, it was on the third day “that dry land was seen” [Gen. 1:9]. For when the world existed as undifferentiated water<sup>172</sup><i class=""footnote""> Lit. <i>mayim be-mayim</i>, water within water.</i> the land could not become visible. Paralleling the Genesis text is “He established the world on its foundations, so that it should never totter” [Ps. 104:5]. That is the time allotted it, one thousand generations. That is fifty thousand years, fifty years for a generation.<sup>173</sup><i class=""footnote""> This alludes to the doctrine of <i>shemitot</i>, or cosmic sabbaths, claiming that the world goes through a series of seven-thousand year cycles and then returns to its source.</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:35,"[Ps. 104:6]: “You made the deep cover it as a garment”: The deep coexists with the world like a pot and its lid. Thus [the verse continues] “the waters stood above the mountains.” How were the waters gathered to one side? For you rebuked them “and they fled from your rebuke” [Ps. 104:7], as in: “The voice of the Lord is over the waters, the God of glory thunders, the Lord, over the mighty waters” [Ps. 29:3]. That is why it repeats the word: “Water, water.”<sup>174</sup><i class=""footnote""> The repetition in Ps. 29:3 is not direct. There may be an allusion here to the tale of R. Akiva’s ascent to the <i>pardes</i>, as described in b. <i>Ḥagigah</i> 14b.</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:36,"[Ps. 104:8]: “They rise up to the mountains, flow down to the valleys, to that place You have assigned to them”: This refers to the ocean, as in “Let the waters be gathered to one place” [Gen. 1:9]. “God called the dry place ‘land’” [Gen 1:10] means that He drew forth the Will, which is the [upper] end of Thought, to the “dry place,” “dry” refers to that which does not bear fruit.<sup>175</sup><i class=""footnote""> He derives ‘<i>erets</i> from <i>r-ts-h</i>, meaning “will.” <i>Keter</i> is extended to meet <i>malkhut</i>. The circle of the <i>sefirot</i> is thus closed.</i> He drew to her this end of Thought, which is the totality of all the entities. Thus Scripture says: “Let the land bring forth grass” [Gen 1:11] and “Let the waters be gathered,” making channels through which the river then proceeds from Eden, flowing on the fifth day to water the garden. But for now those channels appeared as raw form [<i>golem</i>]; there was as yet no drawing forth. The channels were only preparations for the flowing springs.<sup>176</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>sefirot</i> as <i>kelim</i>, or the ordering of the sefirotic structure, “precedes” (better “underlies”) the actual flow of divine energy into these channels.</i> Therefore it says:"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:37,"[Ps. 104:10–11]: “He sends forth springs in the river-beds; they run between the mountains, giving drink to all the beasts of the field”: This refers to the well-known “beast,” the one who is also called “garden,” of which it says: “A river flows forth from Eden to water the garden” [Gen. 2:10]."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:38,"[Ps. 104:11]: “The wild beasts quench their thirst”: The angels are thus called, those appointed to serve over matters of this world, as it is conducted. These are also “the young lions roar for prey” [Ps. 104:21]. And thus: “the gathering of waters He called seas” [Gen. 1:10]. He drew forth the central line, the one that nurses from the Source, like a spinal column drawing sustenance from the brain, into an attribute of day, passing through the cosmic Foundation, as in “all the rivers flow into the sea” [Eccles.1:6]. All the channels flow from the attribute of day to that of night by means of the cosmic Foundation.<sup>177</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Tiferet</i>, the male energy of the central column, reaches into the heights of <i>keter</i>, the Will that is above the upper reaches of Mind, and flows down through <i>yesod</i>, its sexual manifestation, into <i>malkhut</i>, the “garden” or female.</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:39,"[Ps. 104:12]: “Upon them dwell the birds of heaven”: Upon these two attributes; because of them, the ministering angels exist. “From amid the branches they give forth their voice”: The voices proceed from the seventy names, all of them deriving from the primal and innermost soft voice, the singular nation, parallel to the power of Israel, making seventy-one."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:40,"[Ps. 104:13]: “He gives the mountains drink from His upper chambers”: Because grasses and plants do not grow until the rain falls, it says: “He gives the mountains drink.” Right after this it says: “He causes grass to grow for the cattle; earth is sated by the fruit of Your deeds” [Ps. 104:14–15]. And where do they all come from? The “upper chambers,” which is to say “the fruit of Your deeds.” From the upper chambers, the glorious palaces which are the primal spiritual elements, come the forces that bring about rain for the world. This is the fruit of those “deeds,” for they are the cause of all being and non-being in the world, the cause of light and darkness. Of them are born the clouds<sup>178</sup><i class=""footnote""> Hebrew term obscure.</i> over the earth, from which the rain comes. The Land of Israel drinks of the innermost and purest of these, since it is parallel to the central column, the innermost, while the rest of the world drinks of them in diluted form. Of this Scripture says: “He builds His upper chambers in the heavens and founds His vault upon the earth; He calls to the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the earth” [Amos 9:6]. After mentioning the upper chambers, he speaks of the rain that comes about through them. Job too mentions first the primal causes and then the rain that comes about because of them: “He looks to the ends of the earth and sees beneath all of heaven, making a weight for the wind and measuring out the waters. He makes a decree for the rain and a way for the thunderstorm” [Job 28:24–26]. The rain is sent forth as a result of those primal causes. Of this Scripture says: “Depth calls unto depth by the sound of Your channels” [Ps. 42:8]. Understand this. The drops of rain are the drops of sexual coupling, coming from that which is without end [<i>eyn sof</i>]."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:41,"Parallel to “Let the earth bring forth grasses” [Gen. 1:11], which sets out the pattern of all generation, it says here: “He causes grass to grow for the cattle” [Ps. 104:14–15]. After telling us that rain is sent forth as a result of those primal forces, he says that grasses and plants grow because of forces attached to those same primal entities, for there is no blade of grass below that does not have a power attached to it above by which it comes to be and grows, and for the sake of which it exists. The Psalm goes on to say:"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:42,"[Ps. 104:15]: “Grass for man’s labors … wine to make man’s heart glad, and food to satisfy the heart”: The rain and the grasses that grow because of it are human food, and drinks bring us joy. So too: “May the trees of the Lord be sated, the cedars of Lebanon He has planted, there where the birds make their nests” [Ps. 104:16–17]. The mountain goats and rabbits up on the boulders and the high mountains, all sensate beings, need those primal entities which are the first source of the entire birth process. How “may the trees of the Lord<sup>179</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here “trees” and “cedars” are taken as symbols of the <i>sefirot</i>.</i> be sated”? They are sated first from the Source of Life, giving of the overflow of their water to living creatures, both feeling and unfeeling. “The cedars of Lebanon that He planted” [Ps. 104:16] are those delicate entities, as we have explained. This is the meaning of “where the birds make their nests” [Ps. 104:17]. “The high mountains are for the mountain-goats; the boulders are hiding-places for rabbits” [Ps. 104:18]. Here it has been explained that everything draws life from those primal entities, nursing from those that emerged and appeared on the third day.<sup>180</sup><i class=""footnote""> The seven lower <i>sefirot</i> are born of <i>binah</i>, the third <i>sefirah</i>, or possibly referring to <i>tiferet</i>, the third of the seven upper “days.”</i> This was fixed in their nature as a primal and eternal desire. He placed their rule over the earth, that all creatures be attached to them and sustained by them, and in the end that all return to them. Of this it says here [on the third day] “And it was good.”"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:43,"[Ps. 104:19]: Parallel to “Let there be lights” [Gen. 1:14], the Psalmist says: “He made the moon for fixed seasons.” The word “Let there be” indicates a drawing forth from Wisdom; therefore it is used in the account of creation only when referring to inward things:<sup>181</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sefirot</i>.</i> light, firmament, luminaries. But of whatever was formless it says “Let there appear,” so that potential form or soul might appear in them.<sup>182</sup><i class=""footnote""> Hebrew obscure; translation conjectural.</i> So it is said of Adam, that in his fourth hour the soul-breath was cast into him. [The following line, having to do with the hiding of the light after seven days, and quoting Ps. 97:11, is quite garbled in the manuscript as well as the printed edition, and must be considered untranslatable. It may refer to the light of the seven sefirotic “days” transferred to the <i>shekhinah</i>.]"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:44,"[Ps. 104:20]: “God made the two great lights, the greater light …” [Gen. 1:16]. He gave it dominion over those servants appointed to rule the night. Thus it says “You bring on darkness and it is night, when all the beasts of the forest stir.” This refers to the well-known “beast” who rules at night and the servants appointed over the night, who seek from her their appropriate role and tasks. These are “the young lions roar for prey, asking of God their food” [Ps. 104:21]. This means to draw it forth to them and lead them, so that which they are appointed over might exist. Of this it is also said: “She rises while it is yet night, giving food to her household and portions to her maidservants” [Prov. 31:15]."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:45,"[Ps. 104:22]: “When the sun shines they return home, crouching in their dens”: This refers both to those who serve at night and to the one who rules over them."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:46,"[Ps. 104:23]: “Man goes forth to his work”: the attribute of day; “and to his work unto evening”: serving the attribute of night. That is why it says here “and it was good” [Gen. 1:18], for the lights were kindled to receive the power of the soul. Thus far the completion of the fourth day, including the attributes of day and night. It is said that all creatures are attached and bound to these, the source of all that they bring forth. These rule, as master rules over servant, one over the day and the other over the night. Thus the passage concludes: “How many are Your works, O Lord, You have made them all in wisdom,<sup>183</sup><i class=""footnote""> Both <i>tiferet</i>, the sun or power of day, and <i>shekhinah</i>, the moon or power of night, rule by the power of <i>hokhmah</i>, source of the flow that animates them.</i> the earth is filled with Your creations” [Ps. 104:24]."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:47,"Now the Psalm begins to speak of how the divine will flows into all the secondary beings who were created in the sea of wisdom, of the completion of the structure through them, and of the further extension of those well-springs that had begun to flow into the sea of wisdom on the fifth day."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:48,"[Ps. 104:25]: Parallel to “Let the waters bring forth creeping things” [Gen. 1:20] it says: “There is the sea, vast and wide, its creatures beyond number, beings both small and great.” “The face of the cherub is like that of a man,”<sup>184</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Hagigah</i> 13b.</i> the cherub being in the form of a little child. When it says “birds shall fly” [Gen. 1:20], it refers to the two cherubim which draw blessing forth, the attributes of south and north. Of these Scripture says: “Awake, O north, and come forth, O south. blow your winds in my garden” [Cant. 4:16], as we have explained it. Once heaven and earth are doing their work, the power of these other two attributes is drawn toward them and added to them."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:49,"[Ps. 104:26]: “There go the ships”: those channels created on the third day. Of this it says: “She is like a merchant ship, she brings her food from afar” [Prov. 31:14]. She brings them through those channels, well-springs, and streams, and they flow into this sea and appear there."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:50,"“God created the great sea-monsters” [Gen. 1:21]: These are the four camps outside the <i>shekhinah</i> of the blessed Holy One, glorifying and exalting Him with words of song and praise. Of this it says “You created him to delight in him” [Ps. 104:26]."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:51,"“And all the living creatures who creep” [Gen. 1:21]: This is the being with four faces, those of man, lion, ox, and cherub. Each of those faces itself has four faces and four wings, the wings spread out above the faces. Their appearance and their deeds have the appearance of fire. Within the red fire there is a black fire. This is the one spoken of in the [prophetic] tradition, where it says: “That is the being I saw beneath the God of Israel on the River Chebar, and I knew that they were cherubs” [Ezek. 10:22]. That is why the verse says: “which the waters caused to swarm forth after their kind” [Gen. 1:21]: They are [collectively] called “beast” [or “being”], for their bodies are joined but the faces are separate.<sup>185</sup><i class=""footnote""> The author plays on the inconsistency of number in these texts.</i> Therefore it says: “which the waters caused to swarm forth after their kind.”"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:52,"“And each winged bird after its kind”:This refers to those angels created on the fifth day, for there are various rungs, some lower than others and some higher than others. There is a fire that pushes out fire and a fire that consumes fire. Some of them are from water, still others from air. The mission of each is in accord with its essence: the one sent on an errand of mercy is from water; the one who goes as an emissary of justice is derived from fire. Therefore no one angel is sent for both justice and mercy."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:53,"“God blessed them, saying: ‘Be fruitful and multiply, filling the land and the waters of the seas’” [Gen. 1:22]. As Scripture says, “Like entities in the full belly” [Eccles. 11:5], since water did not flow forth from wisdom until the sixth day, of which Scripture says “Let earth bring forth a living being after its kind” [Gen. 1:24]. The angels that were created on the fifth day are negated, just as the spark is reabsorbed into the coal, once they have sung their song. The reason [for their existence] is external to them and they are not sufficiently strong to stand before their Creator. They are incarnated a second time, sing their song, and then they disappear. Of this matter it has been said: “New each morning, great is Your faith!” [Lam. 3:23]. Here our Psalm continues: “All of them look to You to give them their food in its due time” [Ps. 104:27]. This refers to their flowing forth."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:54,"[Ps. 104:28–30]: “You give to them and they gather … when You hide Your face, they are terrified; when You take their breath, they die. Send Your breath and they are created….” All I have created is for your sake; that is why it says here: “it was good” [Gen. 1:21]. Thus it says of Adam, that in the fifth hour he stood up on his feet."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:55,"Of the sixth day Scripture says: “Let earth bring forth” [Gen. 1:24]. Let it bring forth all the generations, and with them the spirit of the first human came forth. Parallel to “God created man in His image” [Gen. 1:27], the completion of the structure, replete with its future implications and potentials, conducting it in such a way that each part is joined to the others, the Psalm says: “May the glory of YHVH be forever!” [Ps. 104:31]. For the name was not complete until Adam was created in God’s image. Only then was the seal complete, about which the prophet said to the prince of Tyre: “you are the seal of the account” [Ezek. 28:12]. He meant to say that you are on the rung of Adam, who completed the ten <i>sefirot</i>. The word <i>tokhnit</i> here means “account,” as in “a full account of the bricks” [Exod. 5:18]. Of this it says: “May the glory of YHVH be forever!”: a complete name spoken over a complete world."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:56,"“May YHVH rejoice in His creatures,” He caused the holy spirit to lie upon him, for he was crowned and adorned with the ten <i>sefirot.</i> So too it says of Adam that in the sixth hour he gave the creatures names. Here He concludes His words regarding the sixth day, sealing them with “it was good,” the name of God. Here the phrase is repeated a second time in the verse “God saw all that He had made, and behold it was very good” [Gen. 1:31]. The word “very” refers to attachment to the Nothing, which is [the primal] good, that which brings about the renewal of generations. Thus it said in the Torah scroll of Rabbi Meir: “and behold, death was good.”<sup>186</sup><i class=""footnote""> Bereshit Rabbah 9:5.</i> For this reason too they established the blessing “who is good and does good”<sup>187</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Berakhot</i> 46b.</i> to be recited in the house of mourning, for if one generation did not pass, no new one could come in its place."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:57,"The six extensions parallel the six days of the week and the six thousand times 365, the years of the world. The river that flows from Eden never ceases, and souls return and are reincarnated."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:58,"From here on the Psalmist is speaking of the seventh extension, which is something like the backbone in the human body, providing a basis for each of the six extensions. It is the blessed Holy One’s chamber of strength.<sup>188</sup><i class=""footnote""> The seventh extension or direction is mysterious, beyond the six directions of space. It seems here to be the direction called “inward” or “innermost.” the center from which all the others radiate.</i> Of it <i>Sefer Yesirah</i> says: “The extensions have a holy place prepared in His place. The holy palace is placed at the center and it maintains them all.”<sup>189</sup><i class=""footnote""> Sefer Yetsirah 4:2.</i> It is parallel to the Sabbath and to the seventh millennium, which is entirely Sabbath rest, life eternal. All souls cleave and are joined to the Throne of Glory: “there is no breaching and none goes out” [Ps. 144:14]."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:59,"This is the meaning of “Heaven and earth were completed, and all their hosts” [Gen. 2:1]. They were perfected and made into lovely and perfect vessels,<sup>190</sup><i class=""footnote""> A play on words, reading <i>ve-yekhulu</i>, “were completed,” as derived from <i>keli</i>, “vessel.”</i> perfect in physical form, in structure, and in type."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:60,"“On the seventh day God completed the work that He had made” [Gen. 2:2]. He included within that central column all that he had wrought in the six extensions, indicating that the seventh day is the end of the flow which is the world’s existence, and thus that the world will be destroyed. “And He rested on the seventh day from all the work that He had made” [Gen. 2:2]: Sabbath, the Holy Spirit amid the six extensions."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:61,"“God blessed the seventh day” [Gen. 2:3]: He blessed it above the other entities by an infusion of the Holy Spirit. This indicates also that in the seventh millennium all souls will be in the Bond of Life, delighting in it."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:62,"“And He called it holy, for on it He rested” [Gen. 2:3]: The power of soul was added to it, distinguishing it from all the other entities."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:63,"“That God had made” [Gen. 2:3]: Actions, including the calling forth of future generations. It further indicates that the entire seventh millennium, which parallels the seventh extension, is holy, without Satan and without the evil urge, as it says: “He called it holy.”"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:64,"Thus there are three allusions to the seventh millennium: the destruction of the world, the delight of souls, and the negation of the evil urge. Parallel to the world’s destruction, David says in our Psalm: “He looks to earth and it trembles; He touches the mountains and they smoke” [Ps. 104:32]. Of the delight of souls he says: “I will sing to the Lord as I live!” [Ps. 104:33]. “In [that millennium] there will only be the righteous seated and crowned….”<sup>191</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Berakhot</i> 17a.</i> There will be haloes about them of the clear light that hovers over the soul’s light. Of that great delight, the taste of which is unequaled, he says “as I live,” referring to life eternal, about which he further says: “I shall rejoice in the Lord” [Ps. 104:34]. This joy is the added Holy Spirit, basking in the light of <i>shekhinah</i> as it cleaves to the soul. Of the negation of the evil urge and the passing away of the spirit of defilement, he says: “Sins will vanish from the earth” [Ps. 104:35]. Of this the sages said: “David composed one hundred and three Psalms, but he did not say ‘Hallelujah’ until he saw the fall of the wicked,<sup>192</sup><i class=""footnote""> b. <i>Berakhot</i> 9b.</i> meaning the negation of the evil urge. When David foresaw in the holy spirit the soul’s delight and its rest, he cried out ‘Praise the Lord. O my soul, Hallelujah!’”"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:5:65,[Here resumes the commentary on the Song of Songs:]
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:8:1,"<b>Sixty are the queens:</b> It is known that the emanation of both worlds took place at once. They are parallel to one another, facing one another. The World to Come has seven spatial extensions, of which Solomon in his wisdom said: “Wisdom has built her house, hewn out her seven pillars” [Prov. 9:1]. Of those the seventh is holy, the six being the six extensions, as we have explained. From these derive seventy names, standing within the twelve cosmic “arms.”<sup>193</sup><i class=""footnote""> Sefer Yesirah 5:1 uses this term (based on Deut. 33:27) for twelve directions, a refinement of the original six.</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:8:2,"So too is this world sevenfold, divided into seventy nations which stand within those twelve directions. Below too, the central column is drawn forth as the holy one. It is Zion, as Scripture says: “From Zion, perfect in beauty, God appears” [Ps. 50:2]. This is what the sages meant when they said: “Whoever lives outside the land is like one who has no God.”<sup>194</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ketubut</i> 110b.</i> Each people derives its power from the extension to which it is parallel, from which it has been drawn forth. Thus it must be that there are seventy nations. Deduct from these ten those that belong to the spiritual central line, the Land of Israel, of which it will not be said in the future: “they did not utterly destroy them” [Josh. 13:13]. All of them as one will be wiped away and will cease to exist, both from the world and from the Throne of Glory. They are the Kenite, the Kenizite, the Kadmonite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivite, the Girgashite, the Jebusite, and the Perizite. There thus remain sixty, of whom it says: “Sixty are the queens.”"
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:8:3,"<b>And eighty concubines:</b> These are the chieftains of Esau, the princes of Ishmael, and the children of Keturah. They make up eighty."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:8:4,<b>And maidens beyond number:</b> These are the countries and cities.
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:8:5,"This is why the sages of Israel composed six orders [of Mishnah], parallel to the six extentions, comprising sixty tractates, parallel to the sixty queens. In the order called “Women” there are seven tractates, comprising seventy-one chapters. The Sanhedrin number seventy-one, since they are in charge of justice.<sup>195</sup><i class=""footnote""> The text may be assuming the special relationship, well known in later Kabbalah, between the female and <i>din</i> or “justice.”</i> The rabbis said in the tractate Kiddushin:<sup>196</sup><i class=""footnote""> Kiddushin 76a.</i> “You do not check [for impurities in the family tree] beyond membership in the Sanhedrin. Why? Because it is taught that just as the court is pure with regard to its judgment, so is it pure of any other defect. Said Amemar: ‘What is the basis in Scripture? “You are entirely beautiful, my love; there is no defect in you” [Cant. 4:7].’” This means to say that they are like the <i>shekhinah</i>, which comprises seventy-one, and they have to be as free of any defect as She is."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:8:6,"The sages also said, regarding the verse “I have said, ‘How shall I place you among the sons and give you a land of delight?’” [Jer. 3:19], that this is like the tale of a king who had concubines and many children born of them. He also had a single son from the queen, his wife, whom he loved very greatly. The king gave fields and vineyards to all the sons of the concubines. Then he gave his son but a single orchard, saying to him: “By your life! All my treasuries are filled only by this orchard! Because I love you so much more than your brothers I have given it to you.”<sup>197</sup><i class=""footnote""> Midrash Tanḥuma, Kedoshim 12.</i> Thus the blessed Holy One created the nations of the world, as it says: “Sixty are the queens and eighty concubines, maidens without number.” These are the nations."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:9:1,"[This] refers to the community of Israel. God divided the world among the nations, giving them fields and vineyards, as Scripture says: “When the Most High caused the nations to inherit” [Deut. 32:8]. But to Israel He gave the Land of Israel, God’s own treasury. From it come the sacrifices, the shewbread, the first fruits, and all good things. Why so much? Because he distinguished between the son of the queen and the sons of the concubines. “I have said, ‘How shall I place you among the sons?’” [Jer. 3:19]."

Commentary on Song of Songs 6:10:2,"A reference to <i>shekhinah,</i> as Scripture says: “The Lord looked forth [<i>hishkif</i>] from heaven at the children of man” [Ps. 14:2];<sup>198</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shekhinah</i> is the power of providence, coming forth from “heaven” or <i>tiferet.</i></i> “Look forth [<i>hashkifah</i>] from Your holy dwelling” [Deut. 26:15]."
Commentary on Song of Songs 6:11:1,"<i>Shekhinah</i> says: “My eyes and heart are toward Israel, to see among them an enlightened person who seeks God.” This refers to the Second Temple period.

Commentary on Song of Songs 8:4:1,"<b>I adjure you …</b> : These are the words of the <i>shekhinah</i> during the time of exile, adjuring Israel not to force the coming of the End and not to arouse love until the time of favor arises. The verse does not stipulate either by the gazelles or hinds of the field [Cant. 2:7], for the <i>shekhinah</i> is not in her place."
Commentary on Song of Songs 8:5:1,"<b>Who is she who comes up from the desert?</b>: This is the tenth of the ten journeys which the <i>shekhinah</i> undertook.

Commentary on Song of Songs 8:5:3,"As for the text’s statement, <b>under the apple tree I roused you</b>, this parable refers to the Cherub of the Left Side, that is the locus of the beginning of form. The usage “roused you” alludes to the intimacy and the awakening of love during the time when Israel are present in their land, performing the will of the Omnipresent, as our Sages said: “One verse states: ‘Their faces were directed towards each other’ [Exod. 25:20]. The other verse stipulates: ‘they were standing up facing the House’ [II Chron. 3:13]. There is no contradiction here. Their countenances face each other when Israel are performing God’s will. Their faces are directed towards the House when Israel are not performing God’s will.”<sup>204</sup><i class=""footnote""> Baba Batra 99a.</i>"

Commentary on Song of Songs 8:12:3,"Two hundred years out of this millennium belong to <b>those who guard its fruit:</b> to those meriting the reward of the study of Torah and the observance of its commandments who had died previously and had yearned for the coming of the Messianic consummation and the resurrection of the dead.

Commentary on Song of Songs 8:13:2,"<b>A lover is listening…</b>: This is Israel who listen for your voice to gather their exiles, when you shall go forth before them as in the past. It is known that the ten tribes were exiled forty years before Judah and Benjamin. These underwent exile in three waves, as it is written: “for the first time brought abasement to the land of Naphtali and Zebulun while the later time was severe” [Isa. 8:23]. This is clarified in <i>Seder ‘Olam</i>, based on the verses. Judah and Benjamin also underwent exile in three waves, as it is written: “You walked in your sister’s path; therefore I will place her cup in your hands” [Ezek. 23:31]. And so it is clearly explicated in the verse."
Commentary on Song of Songs 8:13:3,"Those who first went forth into exile will be the first to return. Some time later, the children of Judah will return. So Isaiah prophesied when he said: “In that day my Lord will apply His hand a second time to redeem the other part of His people from Assyria—as also from Egypt, Pathos, Nubia, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the coastlands” [Isa. 11:11]. The verse specifies “a second time,” for the redemption of the ten tribes will come first. And thus “the other part of His people” who will have remained in Assyria. In the following verse Isaiah lists the two exiles and makes mention of the two acts of redemption, referring to each and every one with its proper name. He says: “He will hold up a signal to the nations and assemble the banished of Israel; and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth” [Isa. 11:12]. He refers to the ten tribes as the “banished of Israel” as they dwell together but are banished from their land. The exile of Judah is designated as a dispersion, “and he will gather the dispersed of Judah.” The house of Israel will anoint a Messiah called Messiah ben Joseph; he will conquer lands and kingdoms and go to Jerusalem and rebuild it, as it is written: “The Lord builds Jerusalem, He gathers in the dispersed of Israel” [Ps. 147:2]. But he will die in battle. Of him it states: “In that day, the wailing in Jerusalem shall be great” [Zach. 12:11] and “they shall lament to Me about those who are slain” [Zach. 12:10]. Afterwards, the dispersed and scattered among the nations shall come and appoint a single leader, the Messiah, son of David, who was with them in exile. They will come to the Land of Israel with the permission of the kings of the nations and with their assistance. As it is written: “And out of all of the nations, said the Lord, they shall bring all your brothers on horses, in chariots and drays, on mules and dromedaries to Jerusalem, My holy mountain, as an offering to the Lord” [Isa. 66:20]. This kingdom will continue and never end. This is the meaning of “Thus declares the Lord God, Who gathers the banished of Israel” [Isa. 56:8]: these are the ten tribes. “I will gather still more to those already gathered” [ibid.]: I add yet another gathering to the first, the dispersed of Judah. This is the meaning of “The Lord your God will restore your exile and have mercy upon you. He will return and gather you from among all the nations among whom He scattered you” [Deut. 30:3]. It is possible that there may be a substantial period of time between these two ingatherings. Afterwards they might yet have to be as herdsmen in the wilderness of the nations, in order to separate out and purify the wicked among Israel, and to smelt them just as silver is smelt in the refining furnace, as happened during the Exodus from Egypt….<sup>208</sup><i class=""footnote""> An eschatological discussion of Zech. 9:9 etc. has been ellipted.</i>"
Commentary on Song of Songs 8:14:1,"By means of the holy spirit he looked forward and prophesied concerning the seventh millennium, the day that is entirely Sabbath and rest, for life eternal. Souls will be bound up in the bond of life and they will be a throne for the Lord. Then the river which is the life and existence of the world, flowing forth from the Eden of Wisdom, will cease its flow. This is the meaning of <b>Flee, my beloved:</b> pointing to the rising of the Glory, its ascent into the upper light."
Commentary on Song of Songs 8:14:2,"<b>And be like a deer on the mountain of spices:</b> That is a place containing all beings, filled up with all bodies, wondrous in counsel, entering all those heights. May I deserve to be counted among those who make less of themselves; “after two days may He quicken us” [Hos. 6:2] to see the glory of Jerusalem, when the moon’s light is bright as the sun, and the sun has sevenfold its light. Thus Scripture has foretold: “The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, like the light of the seven days, on the day when the Lord binds up the bruise of His people, and heals the stroke of their wound” [Isa. 30:26]."
