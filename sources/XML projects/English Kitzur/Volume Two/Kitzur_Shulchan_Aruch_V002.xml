<title>Chapter 97 The Laws of Rosh Chodesh and Sanctification of the Moon</title>
<p>1) Some people are accustomed to fast on Erev Rosh Chodesh<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> and recite the order of <italic>Yom Kippur Kattan,</italic> for on this day we are forgiven for all the sins committed in the past month.<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> It is likened to the <italic>Seir</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> [goat offering] of Rosh Chodesh, and as we say in the Mussaf service, &#x201C;It is a time of atonement for all their generations.&#x201D; Each communifty should follow its own custom.</p>
<p>2) It is a Mitzvah to have an elaborate meal on Rosh Chodesh, and if it occurs on Shabbos, an extra cooked dish should be prepared in addition to those prepared on other <italic>Shabbasos.</italic></p>
<p>3) It is permissable to do <italic>Melacha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> on Rosh Chodesh, but women customarily refrain from doing <italic>melachah</italic> on this day.<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup> This is a proper custom and it should not be made trivial for them.</p>
<p>4) <italic>Hallel</italic> should be said while standing, and without interruption. You should try to say it with the congregation.<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup> Therefore, if you arrive at the synagogue when the congregation is about to say <italic>Hallel,</italic> you should say <italic>Hallel</italic> with the congregation and recite the other prayers later. And if you are saying <italic>Pesukei Dezimrah</italic> (that is from <italic>Hodu</italic> until after <italic>Az Yashir),</italic><sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup> you should read Hallel with the congregation without saying the berachah before or after the <italic>Hallel,</italic> because the berachah of <italic>Baruch Sheamar</italic> and the berachah of <italic>Yishtabach</italic> also fulfill the berachah for <italic>Hallel.</italic> And only on Rosh Chodesh can this be done, because then parts of the <italic>Hallel</italic> are omitted. This is also true for <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic> and the last days of <italic>Pesach.</italic> But when the entire <italic>Hallel</italic> is recited, this cannot be done.<sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup> And if you recite <italic>Hallel</italic> without the congregation, and two [or more] other persons are present, you should say <italic>Hodu</italic> in their presence<sup><xref rid="fn9">9</xref></sup> in order that they may respond, for the expression <italic>Hodu</italic> (thank Hashem) implies that you are addressing others [to do so]. The law of saying <italic>Hallel</italic> in the house of a mourner, may the Merciful save us, is found further in Chapter 207.</p>
<p>5) After <italic>Hallel</italic> the whole Kaddish<sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup> is recited, a <italic>Seifer</italic> Torah is taken out, and four (men) are called (to the Torah).</p>
<p>The <italic>kohein</italic> reads three <italic>pesukim</italic> (verses), which are <italic>Vayedaber, Tzav, Veamarta.</italic> The Levi repeats the verse of <italic>V&#x2019;amarta,</italic><sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup> and adds: <italic>Es hakkeves echad, veasiris haeifah.</italic> The Yisroel reads from <italic>olas tamid</italic> until <italic>uverashei chodsheychem.</italic> And the fourth person reads from <italic>uverashai chodsheychem</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn12">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) On Rosh Chodesh it is forbidden to fast and to eulogize someone, and the prayer <italic>Tziduk Hadin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn13">13</xref></sup> is not said.</p>
<p>7) It is obligatory to sanctify the moon each month.<sup><xref rid="fn14">14</xref></sup> It should not be sanctified until it is definitely night, which is when its light is visible on the ground, so that you can derive some use from its light. If the moon is covered by a cloud, it should not be sanctified<sup><xref rid="fn15">15</xref></sup> unless the cloud is thin and scanty.<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup> If you began the berachah, and afterwards it was covered by the cloud, you should complete the berachah. But if you estimate that you will not be able to complete the berachah before it is covered, it is forbidden to begin (the berachah).</p>
<p>8) The moon must be sanctified only under the heavens (open sky) and not under a roof.<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup> If, however, there is no clean place [outside] or because of another situation beyond your control [you cannot go outside]; you may sanctify it inside the house through the window.<sup><xref rid="fn18">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>9) It is a mitzvah performed in its excellence to sanctify the moon on <italic>Motzai Shabbos</italic> when you are in high spirits and dressed in fine clothes. But if <italic>Motzai Shabbos</italic> will occur after ten days from the appearance of the new moon, or if it is feared that you will then be unable to sanctify it, you needn&#x2019;t wait until <italic>Motzai Shabbos.</italic> It is a mitzvah to sanctify the moon in the gathering of a multitude of people, since in the multitude of the people is the glory of the King. But it should not be postponed because of this, because the mitzvah to &#x201C;perform precepts promptly&#x201D; overrides the mitzvah of &#x201C;in the multitude of people.&#x201D;</p>
<p>10) The moon should not be sanctified until the passage of at least three days from the appearance of the new moon, and some wait seven days. And when <italic>Motzai Shabbos</italic> occurs before seven days, you should not wait,<sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup> but you should sanctify it on <italic>Motzai Shabbos.</italic> The moon may be sanctified only up to the expiration of half the period of twenty-nine days twelve hours and 793 <italic>chalakim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn20">20</xref></sup> (29 days, 12 hours, 793/1080) that is fourteen twenty-four hour days and eighteen hours and twenty two minutes from the appearance of the new moon.</p>
<p>11) The moon should not be sanctified before <italic>Tisha B&#x2019;av</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn21">21</xref></sup> and not when one is a mourner,<sup><xref rid="fn22">22</xref></sup> unless his mourning period will not end within the ten full days<sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup> after the appearance of the new moon. In such a situation, it may be sanctified during the days of mourning.<sup><xref rid="fn24">24</xref></sup> The moon should not be sanctified on a fast day until some food has been eaten. But in any case after Yom Kippur, since we leave the synagogue in a joyous spirit, confident that our sins were forgiven, we sanctify it<sup><xref rid="fn25">25</xref></sup> immediately.<sup><xref rid="fn26">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>12) The moon should not be sanctified on Friday night,<sup><xref rid="fn27">27</xref></sup> nor on the night of Yom Tov<sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> except in extenuating circumstances, as when by <italic>Motzai Shabbos,</italic> the prescribed time will have passed.</p>
<p>13) A blind person is permitted to sanctify the moon.<sup><xref rid="fn29">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>14) If the moon is visible at the beginning of the night, before you began the <italic>Maariv</italic> prayer, and there is still time, [i.e., there are still] a few more nights in which to sanctify it, you should say the <italic>Maariv</italic> prayer first, and then sanctify the moon, because a mitzvah that is constant takes precedence over one that is only periodic,<sup><xref rid="fn30">30</xref></sup> and also the reading of the <italic>Shemah</italic> is a Biblical precept.<sup><xref rid="fn31">31</xref></sup> If, however, there remains only two or three nights [to the end of the period], since the time is short, it may happen that the moon will be covered by clouds. And in the rainy season even if there remain yet four nights [to the end of the period], it may happen that it will become covered by clouds, and therefore you should first sanctify the moon (and then say <italic>Maariv</italic>). If the moon becomes visible at the time you are saying <italic>Kerias Shema</italic> and its <italic>berachos,</italic> and the time is so limited that before you complete <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic> the time of sanctification will have passed, you may interrupt even in the middle of the <italic>berachos</italic> of <italic>Kerias Shema,</italic> or in the middle of <italic>Kerias Shema</italic> in order to sanctify it. But if possible, you should complete the section [you are reading,<sup><xref rid="fn32">32</xref></sup>] and sanctify the moon between the sections.<sup><xref rid="fn33">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>15) If in the month of <italic>Adar</italic> (the moon) was not visible until the night of the fourteenth which is the time for the reading of the <italic>Megillah,</italic> the moon should be sanctified first and the <italic>Megillah</italic> read afterwards.<sup><xref rid="fn34">34</xref></sup> And if it became visible during the reading of the <italic>Megillah,</italic> then if there will be time even after the reading is concluded to sanctify the moon, the reading of the <italic>Megillah</italic> is not interrupted; but if by the time the <italic>Megillah</italic> is concluded, the time for sanctification will pass, and the entire congregation has not yet sanctified the moon, the reading is interrupted for the sanctifying, and afterwards the <italic>Megillah</italic> is concluded. But if only one person has not yet sanctified the moon, and if he stops to sanctify it, he will have to finish the <italic>Megillah</italic> alone, he must not interrupt, because the public reading of the miracle takes precedence.<sup><xref rid="fn35">35</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1">1. <italic>Mogein Avraham</italic> 417:3. <italic>Bach, Minhagim.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2">2. <italic>Pri Chodosh, Rav Moshe Kordaviro.</italic> It is, therefore, called <italic>Yom Kippur Kattan</italic> which means a small day of atonement. The order of prayers include various <italic>slichos</italic> and themes on repentance.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3">3. The he-goat was brought as a sin-offering every <italic>Rosh Chodesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4">4. <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 417.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5">5. <italic>Biur Halacha</italic> says it is forbidden for women to do <italic>melacha</italic> on Rosh Chodesh in the manner they do every day. Each woman must choose for herself at least one <italic>melacha</italic> she will not do on Rosh Chodesh.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6">6. According to <italic>Rif,</italic> the berachah of <italic>Hallel</italic> is said on Rosh Chodesh only when it is said with a <italic>minyan,</italic> a quorum of ten adult men.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn7">7. According to Nusach Sfard from <italic>Mizmor Lesodah</italic> until after <italic>Az Yashir.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn8">8. For then you must make a berachah on the <italic>Hallel</italic> according to all the <italic>poskim,</italic> for it is an obligation, not a custom.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn9">9. But you do not have to try and find them if they are not in front of you. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah, Eliyohu Rabbah</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn10">10. On a day when there is a <italic>Mussaf</italic> service, the whole Kaddish is said after <italic>Hallel</italic> because <italic>Hallel</italic> marks the completion of the <italic>Shacharis</italic> (morning) prayer. Therefore on Chanukah, only the half-Kaddish is said after <italic>Hallel,</italic> as there is no <italic>Mussaf</italic> service. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 423:1, <italic>Achronim</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn11">11. The reason for this is because at least three verses must be read, for each <italic>aliyah</italic> and also we must not stop less than three verses before the end of a <italic>parsha</italic> (sections). The <italic>parsha</italic> of the <italic>Tamid</italic> (the first parsha read on Rosh Chodesh) has only eight verses, and, therefore, in order to divide it into three <italic>aliyahs,</italic> some repetition is required. The <italic>parsha</italic> of Rosh Chodesh cannot be divided into two <italic>aliyahs</italic> because it has only five verses. Repetition cannot be used there because we must not start less than three verses in a <italic>parsha,</italic> nor stop less than three verses before the end of the <italic>parshah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn12">12. <italic>Gaonim, Shulchan Aruch</italic> 423:2. But in Eretz Yisroel, the opinion of the <italic>Gra</italic> is widely accepted. He says the <italic>kohein</italic> reads the first three verses, the <italic>levi</italic> reads the next five, the third person repeats the last three verses read by the levi plus the two verses about Shabbos, and the fourth person reads the five verses about Rosh Chodesh.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn13">13. This is a prayer expressing acceptance of the Divine judgment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn14">14. <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 42.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn15">15. Ramah 426:1, <italic>Mishnah Berurah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn16">16. <italic>Radvaz</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn17">17. <italic>Ramah</italic> 426:4&#x2014;<italic>Rif</italic>. Since the mitzvah is akin to greeting the Divine Presence (<italic>shechina</italic>), it is disrespectful not to go outside and do it. However, if you have a slight cold or illness, you may do it from your house. (<italic>Mogen Avraham, Bach</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn18">18. It is preferable to do it through an open window if possible. (<italic>Shaar Hatziyun</italic> 426:25, <italic>Pri Megadim</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn19">19. In the winter season it is definitely better not to wait because you may not be able to see it later. <italic>(Mishnah Berurah</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn20">20. An hour is divided into 1,080 <italic>chelakim</italic> (parts). (see <italic>Rambam</italic> 6:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn21">21. <italic>Ramah</italic> 426:2. Because sanctifying the moon is a mitzvah fulfilled with joy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn22">22. <italic>Mogein Avraham.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn23">23. Ten 24 hour periods.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn24">24. <italic>Mogein Avraham.</italic> But the <italic>Biur Halachah</italic> 426:2 says a mourner may not sanctify the moon unless the entire allotted time to sanctify the moon will elapse before the end of the seven days of mourning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn25">25. <italic>Chayei Adam.</italic> After you taste something, you may sanctify the moon even immediately after <italic>Tisha B&#x2019;av</italic>. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah, Achronim</italic>) If there is a <italic>minyan</italic> sanctifying the moon now and there will be none later, you should do it with them even if you have not yet broken your fast. (<italic>Sha&#x2019;ar Hatziyun</italic> 426:9, <italic>Eliyohu Rabba</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn26">26. Even before breaking your fast or putting on shoes. After <italic>Tisha B&#x2019;av,</italic> however, you should first put on your shoes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn27">27. <italic>Radvaz.</italic> The <italic>Sha&#x2019;ar Hatziyun</italic> 426:11 says the reason is because it is a custom to dance at the sanctifying of the moon and, if possible, you should avoid this on Shabbos. There are also many other reasons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn28">28. <italic>Ramah</italic> 426:2. See <italic>Shvuss Yaakov</italic> (vol. 3, resp. 31). The reason is because one should not merge one <italic>simcha</italic> with another. (see <italic>Masechet Moed Katan</italic> 8b)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn29">29. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 426:1 rules that a blind person is obligated to sanctify the moon because he benefits from the light that others have (to guide him). However, since the <italic>Radvaz</italic> and <italic>Maharikash</italic> say that he may not sanctify the moon, <italic>Biur Halachah</italic> rules that it is better to have someone make the berachah for him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn30">30. <italic>Maseches Zevachim</italic> 90a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn31">31. And thus it has precedence over sanctifying the moon which is not Biblically ordained.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn32">32. See <italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</italic> Chapter 16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn33">33. You may only say the (berachah) sanctifying the moon, but not the verses we are accustomed to say after the berachah. [<italic>Lechem Haponim</italic> (author of the <italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</italic>)]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn34">34. Because a mitzvah that is constant has precedence, and also it may get cloudy and you will not be able to sanctify the moon, but the Megillah can be read later as well. (<italic>Nodah B&#x2019;Yehudah</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn35">35. Precedence to a <italic>mitzva d&#x2019;rabonon.</italic></ftnote>

<title>Chapter 98 The Laws of Yom Tov</title>
<p>1) Any<sup><xref rid="fn36">1</xref></sup> <italic>melachah</italic> (work) that may not be done on Shabbos, is also forbidden on Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn37">2</xref></sup> And just as on Shabbos it is forbidden to have work done even by a non-Jew, so it is forbidden on Yom Tov. And just as a person is commanded to allow his animals to rest<sup><xref rid="fn38">3</xref></sup> on Shabbos, so, too, is he commanded on Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn39">4</xref></sup> Yom Tov differs from Shabbos only with regard to the preparation of food,<sup><xref rid="fn40">5</xref></sup> for it says (concerning Yom Tov), &#x201C;Only that which is eaten by any soul, that alone may be prepared by you.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn41">6</xref></sup> This<sup><xref rid="fn42">7</xref></sup> includes kneading, baking, slaughtering, and cooking. Carrying,<sup><xref rid="fn43">8</xref></sup> and lighting a fire<sup><xref rid="fn44">9</xref></sup> are permitted on Yom Tov, even if not needed for preparing food, but for some other necessity.<sup><xref rid="fn45">10</xref></sup> Our Sages, of Blessed Memory,<sup><xref rid="fn46">11</xref></sup> had this rule by tradition regarding these (two <italic>melachos</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn47">12</xref></sup> of which it is said: &#x201C;Since these labors are permitted for the purpose of preparing food,<sup><xref rid="fn48">13</xref></sup> they are also permitted for purposes other than preparing food,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn49">14</xref></sup> but for some other necessity. However, a <italic>yahrzeit</italic> candle may not be lit on Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn50">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) You may not make cheese on Yom Tov, neither may you make butter on Yom Tov. Likewise, you may not curdle milk, by putting it in a stomach or by putting a substance into it to cause the milk to thicken and coagulate. Also,<sup><xref rid="fn51">16</xref></sup> you may not skim off the cream from the milk, unless you leave a little on the milk, the same way it must be done on Shabbos. This, too, is permitted only for as much as you need for that day, but not for the following day, because it amounts to preparing [on Yom Tov for a weekday, which is forbidden]. But if you fear that it will spoil, you may have it skimmed off in the aforementioned manner by a non-Jew.</p>
<p>3) Should spices that are ground before Yom Tov lose their flavor, [before Yom Tov,] they may be ground on Yom Tov, if done in an unconventional manner: such as inclining the mortar on its side,or by pounding them on the table, or similar unconventional procedures. Horseraddish that is grated on a (hand-)grater may not be grated into a dish as is usually done on weekdays, but onto a tablecloth.<sup><xref rid="fn52">17</xref></sup> You may not grind coffee with a grinder,<sup><xref rid="fn53">18</xref></sup> but you may pound it with a mortar in an unconventional manner. It is best to prepare everything on the day before Yom Tov. Foods that do not lose their flavor, certainly should be crushed the day before Yom Tov,<sup><xref rid="fn54">19</xref></sup> but if you forgot (to do it before), you are permitted to do it in an unconventional manner on Yom Tov. All that was mentioned is only permitted for as much as you need for that day, but not for the next day, and you should be stringent to prepare only as much as you need for that particular meal. When grinding matzoh,<sup><xref rid="fn55">20</xref></sup> you should also be careful about this.<sup><xref rid="fn56">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>4) You may not split wood,<sup><xref rid="fn57">22</xref></sup> or even break it by hand.<sup><xref rid="fn58">23</xref></sup> It is also forbidden to gather wood from a place<sup><xref rid="fn59">24</xref></sup> where it is scattered about.</p>
<p>5) Arranging wood on top of the stones to start a fire is prohibited,<sup><xref rid="fn60">25</xref></sup> because you are<sup><xref rid="fn61">26</xref></sup> making a tent; for it is like erecting two walls upon which you are placing a roof. But you can do it in an unconventional manner, that is by holding the wood in your hand and placing the stones underneath. Similarly, when you place a pot on stones to light a fire underneath, you must hold the pot in your hand and place the stones under it; but you may not place it (the pot) on top of the stones.</p>
<p>6) You may not fan a fire with a bellow, because it is forbidden to do so in a professional manner. It is customary to permit (the use of) a domestic-type bellows by operating it in an unconventional manner,<sup><xref rid="fn62">27</xref></sup> holding it in an upside down position, but with a professional bellows it is forbidden, even in an unconventional manner.</p>
<p>7) You may sort all the legumes you need for that day,<sup><xref rid="fn63">28</xref></sup> but not with a sieve or strainer.<sup><xref rid="fn64">29</xref></sup> Neither may you put them in water so that the refuse or the edible part will float. But you may separate them by hand and pick out whatever is easier for you; if it is easier to pick out the refuse,&#x2014;pick out the refuse,<sup><xref rid="fn65">30</xref></sup> and if it is easier to pick out the edible part,&#x2014;pick out the edible part.</p>
<p>8) Flour that has already been sifted, but you wish to sift it a second time, should be sifted by a non-Jew or you may do it in an unconventional manner, turning the sieve upside down. Do the same when sifting crushed matzos. Flour that has never been sifted, may be sifted only by a non-Jew, in an unconventional way. It is forbidden to pick out refuse from flour; for example, if pebbles or something similar fell into it. It is forbidden to separate the large crumbs even from ground matzoh.<sup><xref rid="fn66">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>9) Kneading is permitted on Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn67">32</xref></sup> However, you should not measure the flour but should take it by estimate.<sup><xref rid="fn68">33</xref></sup> If you do not measure exactly, but take less or more, it is permitted to (use a measuring utensil).<sup><xref rid="fn69">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>10) Dough for noodles and farfel used in soups should be kneaded on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov, for if they are older they taste better. But if you did not knead it <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov, you may knead it on Yom Tov in an unconventional way.<sup><xref rid="fn70">35</xref></sup> For example, if you usually knead it on a board, you should knead it on a tablecloth or on something similar.<sup><xref rid="fn71">36</xref></sup> Cooked food that does not spoil, like dried fruits and similar food should be cooked on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn72">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>11) If you knead dough on Yom Tov, you may take <italic>challah</italic> from it. But you may not burn (the <italic>challah</italic> portion), because holy things may not be burned on Yom Tov. It is also forbidden to bake (the <italic>challah</italic> portion)<sup><xref rid="fn73">38</xref></sup> because it is not fit to be eaten, for we are all considered as ritually unclean due to having come in contact with corpses.<sup><xref rid="fn74">39</xref></sup> And it is forbidden to handle (the <italic>challah</italic> portion), but while it is still in your hand, you should put it in a safe place until after Yom Tov, and then burn it. If you knead dough on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov, it is forbidden to take <italic>challah</italic> from it on Yom Tov,<sup><xref rid="fn75">40</xref></sup> but you may bake (the bread) and eat it, leaving a little bread from which to take (<italic>challah</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn76">41</xref></sup> right after Yom Tov. The portion you leave should be sufficient for separating <italic>challah</italic> and have some left over.</p>
<p>12) It is forbidden to mix clay on Yom Tov, even if done by a non-Jew. Therefore if you (need clay) to seal the oven in which you warm your food, for Shabbos, you must prepare clay that was mixed, before Yom Tov. Also taking mud from the street is forbidden, unless it was prepared on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov, and placed in a corner. You should be careful not to smear the clay or mud, but you should seal the oven with it without smearing, for some authorities prohibit this (on Yom Tov) even to keep food warm.</p>
<p>13) Domesticated poultry that is kept in the house or in the yard for food, are permitted to be caught<sup><xref rid="fn77">42</xref></sup> so that you may slaughter them for your Yom Tov needs. But if not needed for food, it is forbidden to catch them.<sup><xref rid="fn78">43</xref></sup> And if they are new and not accustomed to (the house or yard), it is forbidden to catch them even for food, even while they are in the house.<sup><xref rid="fn79">44</xref></sup> But at night, when they are roosting, it is permitted to take them.<sup><xref rid="fn80">45</xref></sup> In any event, you must be careful to select those you intend to slaughter on Yom Tov before Yom Tov, lest the one you will take will prove to be too lean and you will have handled it needlessly.<sup><xref rid="fn81">46</xref></sup> Poultry, not kept for food, but for laying eggs, are <italic>muktzeh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn82">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>14) It is forbidden to catch doves of a dove-cote or doves living in an attic,<sup><xref rid="fn83">48</xref></sup> even though they are accustomed to return to their nests<sup><xref rid="fn84">49</xref></sup> and even if you selected them before Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn85">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>15) It is permitted to cut or burn the rings around the legs of poultry after slaughtering. You may also sew up poultry when you stuff them, but you must be careful to thread the needle on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn86">51</xref></sup> If you did not thread it before Yom Tov, it is forbidden to thread it on Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn87">52</xref></sup> After the poultry is sewn up, you may burn the leftover thread.<sup><xref rid="fn88">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>16) It is forbidden to catch fish in a pond, that cannot be caught with your hands, but (only) with a utensil. But if you can catch them with your hands, you may catch them, even with a utensil.<sup><xref rid="fn89">54</xref></sup> If there are many fish in the pond you must designate before Yom Tov the one you wish to take on Yom Tov, by making a mark on it; and if you need all of them, you must designate all of them by saying before Yom Tov: &#x201C;I am designating all of these fish for Yom Tov.&#x201D;</p>
<p>17) If you are in doubt whether something was caught or prepared on Yom Tov, it is forbidden to be used. If it is very urgent, you may be lenient on the second day of Yom Tov, but not on [the second day] Rosh Hashanah.</p>
<p>18) Living creatures that are <italic>muktzeh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn90">55</xref></sup> may not be given drink, nor may their food be placed within a close reach, but it should be placed a short distance away.</p>
<p>19) If you slaughtered poultry, and it was found to be <italic>tereifah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn91">56</xref></sup> you are forbidden to handle it, similar to other <italic>muktzeh</italic> (items). But if you slaughtered an animal and it was found to be <italic>tereifah,</italic> you may put it in a place where it will not spoil. But if it is impossible to put it away, so that it will not spoil, you may sell it to a non-Jew, provided that no price is set, and it is not weighed. Perhaps with regard to fattened geese among which <italic>tereifos</italic> are generally found, you may be lenient.<sup><xref rid="fn92">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>20) You may not slaughter an animal on Yom Tov<sup><xref rid="fn93">58</xref></sup> unless it is absolutely necessary.<sup><xref rid="fn94">59</xref></sup> It is forbidden to sell meat by weight and at a set price. But you may give someone a piece of meat to be paid for after Yom Tov.</p>
<p>21) When you slaughter an animal (on Yom Tov) it is best not to examine the lungs until after you have skinned it; for if you examine it and it is found to be <italic>tereifah,</italic> it is forbidden to skin it.<sup><xref rid="fn95">60</xref></sup> You are allowed to handle the hide of an animal that was slaughtered that day in order to put it away. But not to spread it on posts.<sup><xref rid="fn96">61</xref></sup> Other hides are absolutely forbidden to be handled. Also, feathers from a bird that was slaughtered that day, may be handled in order to put them away. But it is forbidden to handle any other feathers.<sup><xref rid="fn97">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>22) It is permited to salt meat to draw off the blood,<sup><xref rid="fn98">63</xref></sup> even if it could have been salted the day before Yom Tov,<sup><xref rid="fn99">64</xref></sup> provided you need it for that day. If you have more meat (than you need) and fear it might spoil, you may salt all the meat together,<sup><xref rid="fn100">65</xref></sup> no matter how much there is, and even that which is not needed for today, for it involves the same labor.<sup><xref rid="fn101">66</xref></sup> But meat that has already been salted and its blood (drawn off),<sup><xref rid="fn102">67</xref></sup> and fish that could have been salted<sup><xref rid="fn103">68</xref></sup> on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov, is forbidden to be salted on Yom Tov.</p>
<p>23) When baking pastry on Yom Tov, it is forbidden to shape it into figures either by using a mold or by hand.<sup><xref rid="fn104">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>24) Levelling [or smearing] is forbidden<sup><xref rid="fn105">70</xref></sup> on Yom Tov as on Shabbos. Therefore, it is forbidden to warm<sup><xref rid="fn106">71</xref></sup> a candle of wax or of tallow to make it stick to the candlestick or the wall, for you might inadvertently smear it.<sup><xref rid="fn107">72</xref></sup> If the socket (of the candlestick) is full of tallow,<sup><xref rid="fn108">73</xref></sup> you may clean it with an object that is not <italic>muktzeh.</italic></p>
<p>25) It is forbidden to extinguish a fire on Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn109">74</xref></sup> It is even forbidden to extinguish it indirectly. Therefore, it is forbidden to place a burning candle where the wind may blow it out, even though when you place it no wind is blowing.<sup><xref rid="fn110">75</xref></sup> It is also forbidden to open a door or a window opposite a burning candle. See above chapter 80:2</p>
<p>26) It is permitted to cover a fire (on Yom Tov)<sup><xref rid="fn111">76</xref></sup> with a vessel or ashes that have been prepared (before Yom Tov).<sup><xref rid="fn112">77</xref></sup> Even though it may be slightly extinguished by being covered,<sup><xref rid="fn113">78</xref></sup> nevertheless since your intention is not to extinguish it, (and it is a <italic>melachah</italic> not needed for its own sake),<sup><xref rid="fn114">79</xref></sup> it is permitted for the needs of the Yom Tov. But it is permitted only when you need it for that day. But for the needs of the (following) night it is forbidden, for the night belongs to the second day.</p>
<p>27) You may not kasher utensils by placing them in boiling water,<sup><xref rid="fn115">80</xref></sup> nor by heating them until red hot,<sup><xref rid="fn116">81</xref></sup> once they have become forbidden for use.<sup><xref rid="fn117">82</xref></sup> For the laws of immersing (new) utensils on Yom Tov, see Chapter 37 above.</p>
<p>28) The law regarding washing dishes on Yom Tov is the same as on Shabbos.<sup><xref rid="fn118">83</xref></sup> It is forbidden to wash dishes on the first day Yom Tov to be used on the second day of Yom Tov.</p>
<p>29) It is forbidden to make a fire in order to heat the house, unless the cold is so severe that the food congeals; then it is considered as required for the preparation of food. But if the cold is not so severe, it is forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn119">84</xref></sup> If done by a non-Jew, it is permitted</p>
<p>30) It is permitted to heat water to wash your hands<sup><xref rid="fn120">85</xref></sup> but not for bathing your whole body.<sup><xref rid="fn121">86</xref></sup> If you need (warm) water to bathe a child, it is also forbidden to heat the water for him, even through a non-Jew.<sup><xref rid="fn122">87</xref></sup> But you may heat a larger quantity because of him; thus when you need a little water for cooking, it is permitted to heat even a large kettle,<sup><xref rid="fn123">88</xref></sup> provided you pour in all the water before placing it on the fire and do not add any water after that. If the child is slightly ill, it is permitted to have the water heated for him through a non-Jew.<sup><xref rid="fn124">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>31) It is forbidden<sup><xref rid="fn125">90</xref></sup> to touch off a fire either from a flintstone, a glass or a match.</p>
<p>32) You may not make <italic>mugmar,</italic> that is to scatter various spices over coals, either in order to smell its fragrance, or to perfume the house or clothing, for it is written &#x201C;For everyone,&#x201D; (Ex. 12:16). meaning, it must be of a nature that everyone requires. But perfuming is only a necessity for dainty and indulgent people. With regard to smoking tobacco, the <italic>poskim,</italic> of blessed memory, disagree.<sup><xref rid="fn126">91</xref></sup> Even according to those who are lenient, you must be careful not to light it with a (burning) piece of paper or a coal, because when you throw these on the ground, they will be extinguished.<sup><xref rid="fn127">92</xref></sup> It is easy to make the mistake of doing it on Yom Tov, since you are used to doing so during the week. If there are letters on the paper, either written or printed, and you burn it, the prohibition of erasing also applies. Rather, you must light it from a (pre-existing) flame. You also may not smoke a new pipe.<sup><xref rid="fn128">93</xref></sup> It is also forbidden to grind the tobacco on Yom Tov. It would seem that it is also forbidden to cut off the tips of cigars.<sup><xref rid="fn129">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>33) Something which is not a full-scale <italic>melachah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn130">95</xref></sup> and yet is forbidden on Shabbos in order to cure a patient who is not critically ill, is also forbidden even on the first day of Yom Tov, or on both days of Rosh Hashanah, unless it is done by a non-Jew. But on the second day of Yom Tov, (except for the second day of Rosh Hashanah), it may be done, even by a Jew.<sup><xref rid="fn131">96</xref></sup> But a full-scale <italic>melachah</italic> may not be performed for a patient who is not critically ill, even on the second day of Yom Tov unless it is done by a non-Jew. (You should consult a halachic authority before taking any actions in this matter.)</p>
<p>34) Carrying is permitted on Yom Tov. It is permitted to carry even things that are not needed for preparing food, provided there is some other need for it, but if it is totally unnecessary, it is forbidden to be carried out [of the house] unless it is to a place where you are permitted to carry on Shabbos.<sup><xref rid="fn132">97</xref></sup> Concerning things that are needed for food, like kegs of wine, you should not carry as heavy a burden as you do on weekdays; but you should do it in a different way.<sup><xref rid="fn133">98</xref></sup> If it is impossible to do it differently, as when you have many guests,<sup><xref rid="fn134">99</xref></sup> you may carry it the usual manner.</p>
<p>35) All work that is permitted to be done on Yom Tov, may be performed only for the needs of man, but not for animals, for it is written, &#x201C;Shall be done for you,&#x201D; (Ex. 12:16) and it is expounded<sup><xref rid="fn135">100</xref></sup> &#x201C;For you, but not for animals.&#x201D; Therefore it is forbidden to cook or carry out anything for the needs of an animal, just as it is forbidden on Shabbos.</p>
<p>36) It is forbidden to cook or bake for the needs of a non-Jew<sup><xref rid="fn136">101</xref></sup> but if you have a non-Jewish servant, you are allowed to add food<sup><xref rid="fn137">102</xref></sup> and cook it in the same pot so that there should be enough for the servant too. But for a distinguished non-Jew, it is even forbidden to add (food).<sup><xref rid="fn138">103</xref></sup> Moreover, even if you cooked or baked anything for yourself, you are forbidden to invite a non-Jew<sup><xref rid="fn139">104</xref></sup> to eat with you.<sup><xref rid="fn140">105</xref></sup> But if the non-Jew is an ordinary person, you may give him something of what you cooked or baked. Baking bread, even if for your non-Jewish servant, is forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn141">106</xref></sup></p>
<p>37) It is forbidden to carry out anything on Yom Tov for a non-Jew unless to a place where you may carry on Shabbos.</p>
<ftnote id="fn36">1. This includes all rabbinically prohibited work. (<italic>Peri Megadim M.Z.</italic> 308, <italic>Chayei Adam</italic> 80:1)</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn41">6. <italic>Exodus</italic> 12:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn42">7. Many types of <italic>melachah</italic> in the preparations of food are forbidden on Yom Tov (e.g. harvesting, grinding, squeezing grapes etc., threshing, sifting etc.). <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 495:2 rules that these types are prohibited rabbinically, while the <italic>Yerushalmi, Rashba, Reshal, Taz, Vilna Gaon</italic> etc. rule that they are prohibited <italic>de&#x2019;oraisa.</italic> They maintain that the Torah permitted only the kind of labor needed for one day&#x2019;s needs, but not the kind of labor usually done on a large scale.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn43">8. See Chapter 82 for details.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn44">9. You may only light a fire from an existing flame but you are not allowed to produce a new fire. See paragraph 31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn45">10. Most <italic>poskim</italic> maintain it is a <italic>de&#x2019;oraisa</italic> prohibition to carry on Yom Tov if there is no necessity. <italic>Rashi, Riaz</italic> and possibly <italic>Rif</italic> and <italic>Rambam</italic> hold it is <italic>derabanan.</italic> (See <italic>Biur Halachah</italic> 518:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn46">11. See <italic>Maseches Beitzah</italic> 12a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn47">12. Even though carrying and lighting a fire are not <italic>melachos</italic> performed directly on the food itself, they are necessary for its preparation. <italic>Melachos</italic> that are synonymous with food preparation such at baking and cooking are certainly included in this ruling and are permitted for other necessities. (<italic>Maggid Mishneh, Magein Avraham, Vilna Gaon, Machatzis Hashekel, Mishnah Berurah</italic> 518:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn48">13. <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 495:1 implies that <italic>Melachah</italic> is permitted for food requirements, even if it could have been done before Yom Tov and would have the same taste. Most <italic>poskim,</italic> however, <italic>Rema, Maharil, Eliyahu Rabbah, Peri Chadash</italic> etc. maintain that this is forbidden rabbinically, but permit it when done in an unconventional way (<italic>shinui</italic>). (<italic>Rema, Ran</italic>) If you were unable to prepare it before Yom Tov, due to an extreme emergency, you may prepare it on Yom Tov in the usual manner. (<italic>Shulchan Aruch Harav, Mishnah Berurah</italic>) If, however, you just didn&#x2019;t have time to do it before Yom Tov, you must do it in an unconventional way.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn49">14. The <italic>Rema</italic> 518:1 rules that it is permitted to carry something because you fear it will get stolen or lost. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 518:6 rules it proper to be stringent, like the <italic>Rosh, Tur, Maharil, Reshal</italic> etc., who hold the necessity must be for a <italic>mitzvah</italic> or for something you need that day in particular (such as an ornament).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn50">15. The <italic>Kesav Sofer</italic> responsum 65 permits this, but says it is still better to light it in the synagogue where you may light candles on Yom Tov, as it is an honor to the synagogue, (see <italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</italic> 101:2) The <italic>Misgeres Hashulchan</italic> says the custom is to light them even at home but it is best to do it in the synagogue. This is also the view of <italic>Biur Halachah</italic> 514:5, who adds if you light it in your house, you should do it in the room where you eat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn51">16. <italic>Magein Avraham</italic> 510:13, <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 510:23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn52">17. <italic>Chayei Adam</italic> 83:3, <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 504:19. You may not grind it in a grinding mill, even in an unusual manner, for it is an <italic>uvdah de&#x2019;chol,</italic> which is forbidden, even in an unconventional fashion.

<ftnote id="fn53">18. Not even in an unconventional manner. (<italic>Panim Meiros, Peri Megadim, M.Z.</italic> 504:1)</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn55">20. The matzoh is made from ground flour, and you are permitted to grind something that was previously ground, even in the usual manner. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 504:20)</ftnote>

It is prohibited because it is a bother.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn58">23. Cutting small pieces (like match sticks) is a <italic>melachah de&#x2019;oraisa</italic> of grinding. (<italic>Shulchan Aruch Harav,</italic> see <italic>Taz</italic>)</ftnote>

You may not take wood from a field, even if it is not scattered. This is a rabbinical prohibition lest you gather scattered wood.

<ftnote id="fn60">25. These halachos apply only when the sides were set up on Yom Tov. If they were standing from before Yom Tov it is permitted. (<italic>Eliyahu Rabbah, Mishnah Berurah</italic> 502:13)</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn63">28. Unlike Shabbos when, unless it is for immediate use, even separating food from refuse is a <italic>melachah de&#x2019;oraisa.</italic> On Yom Tov, separating (<italic>boreir</italic>) is a <italic>melachah de&#x2019;oraisa</italic> only when separating grain (from chaff etc.), which is usually done on a large scale. (<italic>Shulchan Aruch Harav</italic> 510:3) The <italic>Yeshuos Yaakov</italic> 500:2 rules that separating two types of foods, even on Yom Tov is permitted only for immediate use.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn64">29. Since usually a large quantity is separated with these utensils, it looks as though you are doing it for tomorrow&#x2019;s needs. (<italic>Taz</italic> 510:1, <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn65">30. <italic>Taz</italic> and <italic>Shulchan Aruch Harav</italic> say this is forbidden if you were able to do it before Yom Tov. <italic>Biur Halachah</italic> 510:2 says since you are not using a sieve etc., it is considered doing it in an unusual manner, and it is permitted even if you could have done it before Yom Tov.

<title>Chapter 99 The Laws of Muktzeh on Yom Tov</title>
<p>1) <italic>All Muktzeh,</italic> that is forbidden to be handled on Shabbos, is also forbidden to be handled on Yom Tov. Some authorities say, things that are purposely excluded from use and things excluded from use because of their filth, even though they may be handled on Shabbos, they may not be handled on Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn142">1</xref></sup> Therefore, fruits<sup><xref rid="fn143">2</xref></sup> that were set aside for sale, are forbidden to be handled on Yom Tov, unless you designate them on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov by saying: &#x201C;I will eat from this fruit<sup><xref rid="fn144">3</xref></sup> tomorrow.&#x201D; Concerning fruit that is scheduled to be sold a little at a time, you may be lenient.</p>
<p>2) It is forbidden to handle an egg that was laid on Yom Tov,<sup><xref rid="fn145">4</xref></sup> but you may cover it with a vessel so that it should not break.<sup><xref rid="fn146">5</xref></sup> If it was laid on the first day (of Yom Tov), you may eat it on the second day, but if the second day of Yom Tov occurs on Shabbos, it is forbidden on Shabbos as well. Similarly, if the first day occurs on Shabbos, and it was laid on that day, it is forbidden also on the following day, which is the second day of Yom Tov. Whenever Shabbos borders on Yom Tov, whether before or after it, if it is laid on either of these days, it is forbidden on the other (also). And on Rosh Hashanah, even if it was laid on the first day, it is forbidden on the second day. (The two days of Rosh Hashanah are considered one long day, only concerning restrictive measures, as in this case. In reference to the law regarding the other <italic>yomim tovim,</italic> [however] when it is forbidden to prepare [food] on the first day for the second day, there is no difference between other <italic>yomim tovim</italic> and Rosh Hashanah. It is also forbidden to do so on Rosh Hashanah, because to effect a relaxation of the law we do not say it is considered one long day.)<sup><xref rid="fn147">6</xref></sup> And if Rosh Hashanah occurs on Thursday and Friday, even if it was laid on Thursday, it is forbidden on Shabbos as well. If a hen was slaughtered and eggs found inside it, even if they are fully developed, they are permitted even on that day.</p>
<p>3) Wood may not be handled except to burn as fuel, but (if) not for burning, it is forbidden to handle it. Therefore, you may not support a pot or a door with a piece of wood.<sup><xref rid="fn148">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>4) Ashes (of wood) that was burned before Yom Tov may be handled on Yom Tov because it was fit (before Yom Tov) for all the necessities of man; such as to cover excrement with it or (to cover) saliva and similar things. If the ashes are made from a fire that burned on Yom Tov, then if it is still so hot that an egg can be roasted on it, it may be handled for all the necessities of man. But if it has cooled off, it is forbidden to be handled because it is <italic>nolad</italic> [newly created],<sup><xref rid="fn149">8</xref></sup> (that is) yesterday it was wood and today it is ashes, and this is more stringent than <italic>muktzeh.</italic></p>
<p>5) If you ate nuts before Yom Tov, you may burn their shells (for fuel). But if you ate them on Yom Tov, you may not burn their shells and it is forbidden to even handle them. Similarly, other peels, even though they are fit for animals, (may not be handled them) because they are <italic>nolad;</italic> for yesterday they were fit for human consumption.</p>
<ftnote id="fn142">1. <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 495:4. Since some <italic>melachos</italic> are permitted for preparation of food on Yom Tov, the Sages feared people might not view Yom Tov with the proper seriousness, and, therefore, were more stringent regarding <italic>muktzeh</italic> on Yom Tov than on Shabbos. (see <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 495:15)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn143">2. Even though you may handle <italic>muktzeh</italic> for preparation of food, it is permitted only to remove the <italic>muktzeh</italic> in order to take the food etc., but you may not use the <italic>muktzeh</italic> itself, even for food or its preparation. (<italic>Magein Avraham, Mishnah Berurah</italic> 508:31)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn144">3. The <italic>Ramah</italic> 495:4 rules that only <italic>livestock</italic> must be designated, but regarding fruits etc., it is sufficient to say you will take from the pile. The <italic>Rif, Rambam, Rosh, Meiri, Magein Avraham</italic> etc. rule that even fruits must be designated and that it is necessary to make some sign or notation to this effect. The <italic>Meiri</italic> explains that the purpose of a sign is to remember which ones were selected; therefore, one who has a good memory need not make a sign. (see <italic>Biur Halachah</italic> 495:4)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn145">4. <italic>Ramah</italic> 513:1. But the <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 513:3 rules as the <italic>Shulchan Aruch, Taz, Magein Avraham</italic> and <italic>Vilna Gaon</italic> that since it is round and moves very easily, you are not even allowed to touch it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn146">5. But care must be taken not to touch it with the vessel. (<italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 513:4, see footnote 4)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn147">6. See Chapter 101:6 and footnote.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn148">7. <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 502:3. This refers to dry wood which is fit for fuel and thus can be handled and used for fuel. (<italic>Magein Avraham, Eliyohu Rabbah, Vilna Gaon, Mishnah Berurah</italic>) However, the <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 502:21 cites <italic>Beis Meir</italic>&#x2019;s ruling that in a pressing situation, you may rely on the <italic>Taz</italic> and others who maintain the <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> refers to damp wood that is not fit for fuel and is, therefore, considered <italic>muktzeh</italic>, and this type of <italic>muktzeh</italic> is forbidden on Yom Tov.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn149">8. Anything that is no longer fit for the purpose it had at twilight of the eve of Yom Tov, or anything that has come into being this day is <italic>nolad</italic> (like a chair that was broken on Yom Tov).

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 100 The Laws of the Priestly Blessing</title>
<p>1) It is a positive commandment of the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn150">1</xref></sup> for the <italic>kohanim</italic> to bless the people, as it is said: &#x201C;This is how you must bless the Children of Israel.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn151">2</xref></sup> Any <italic>kohein</italic> who is not disqualified and does not go up to the <italic>duchan</italic><sup><xref rid="fn152">3</xref></sup> violates a positive commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn153">4</xref></sup> But he is not in violation, unless he is called upon to do so,<sup><xref rid="fn154">5</xref></sup> as it is said: &#x201C;Say to them,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn155">6</xref></sup> and the <italic>Targum</italic> translates: &#x201C;When they tell you.&#x201D; It is the custom in our regions<sup><xref rid="fn156">7</xref></sup> that the <italic>kohanim</italic> bless the people only on Yom Tov because then, people rejoice Yom Tov,<sup><xref rid="fn157">8</xref></sup> and it is said that a happy heart will bless, and on Yom Kippur there is (also) rejoicing over the forgiveness and pardon [of our sins]. This is not true on other days. Even on the Shabbos days of the whole year, people are worried about their livelihood and about being idle from work. And even on Yom Tov, they only bless the people during the <italic>musaf</italic> service, because they will soon leave the synagogue and rejoice in the joy of Yom Tov. We are accustomed in our regions that [even] when Yom Tov occurs on Shabbos, the <italic>kohanim</italic> do not bless the people<sup><xref rid="fn158">9</xref></sup> except on Yom Kippur; for even if it occurs on Shabbos, they bless the people. There are communities that have the custom, that on every Yom Tov, even when it occurs on Shabbos, the <italic>kohanim</italic> bless the people; and this is more correct.<sup><xref rid="fn159">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) The <italic>Birkas Kohanim</italic> is pronounced only in a congregation of at least ten adult males,<sup><xref rid="fn160">11</xref></sup> including the <italic>kohanim,</italic> because they also are included in the blessing, as it is said: &#x201C;And I will bless them&#x201D; (<italic>Numbers</italic> 6:27).</p>
<p>3) Before pronouncing the <italic>Birkas Kohanim</italic> the <italic>kohein</italic> may not drink<sup><xref rid="fn161">12</xref></sup> wine or any other intoxicating<sup><xref rid="fn162">13</xref></sup> beverage. And if he feels faint, and wants to eat some cake before <italic>musaf,</italic> he should listen to someone else&#x2019;s kiddush.</p>
<p>4) Before going up to the <italic>duchan</italic> the <italic>kohein</italic> must wash his hands<sup><xref rid="fn163">14</xref></sup> up to the wrist, that is the junction of the hand and the arm, just as the <italic>kohanim</italic> sanctified their hands in the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> before the <italic>avodah,</italic><sup><xref rid="fn164">15</xref></sup> as it is said: &#x201C;Raise your hands in holiness and bless Hashem.&#x201D; It is questionable if they have to recite a berachah on this washing, or if they do not have to say a berachah, since he made a berachah on washing his hands when he got up in the morning. Because of the doubt, the custom is not to recite a berachah. In the meantime<sup><xref rid="fn165">16</xref></sup> if he touched an unclean spot, it would be proper to say a berachah on this washing, but this is not the custom.<sup><xref rid="fn166">17</xref></sup> Every God-fearing <italic>kohein</italic> should watch his hands carefully after washing his hands in the morning, not to touch an unclean spot, so that he would need not repeat the berachah.</p>
<p>5) A <italic>levi</italic> pours the water<sup><xref rid="fn167">18</xref></sup> on the hands of the <italic>kohanim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn168">19</xref></sup> as it is said: &#x201C;And also your brothers, the tribe of <italic>Levi</italic> bring near to you, and they will accompany you and serve you.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn169">20</xref></sup> If no <italic>Levi</italic> is present, a first born of the mother, who is holy, should pour the water on his hands, and if there is no firstborn<sup><xref rid="fn170">21</xref></sup> present, it is better that the <italic>kohein</italic> himself pour it rather than a Yisrael. If the <italic>Levi</italic> or firstborn who pours water on the hands of the <italic>kohanim,</italic> has unclean hands,<sup><xref rid="fn171">22</xref></sup> he must wash them first.</p>
<p>6) The <italic>kohanim</italic> are forbidden to go up to <italic>duchan</italic> wearing shoes.<sup><xref rid="fn172">23</xref></sup> They should remove their shoes before washing their hands.<sup><xref rid="fn173">24</xref></sup> They should be careful to hide their shoes under the benches, so that they cannot be seen, out of respect for the congregation.</p>
<p>7) When the <italic>Chazzan</italic> begins <italic>Retzeih,</italic> all the <italic>kohanim</italic> must leave their places<sup><xref rid="fn174">25</xref></sup> to go up to the <italic>duchan.</italic> Therefore, they should wash their hands before this, so that when the <italic>Chazzan</italic> says <italic>Retzeih,</italic> they will leave their places to go up to the <italic>duchan</italic> with hands fit for the blessing. If post facto they washed their hands afterwards (after <italic>Retzeih</italic>), it is acceptable.<sup><xref rid="fn175">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>8) When they go up to the <italic>duchan,</italic> they stand facing the Holy Ark (which is) in the East, and they say <italic>Modim Derabanan</italic> with the congregation, and after<sup><xref rid="fn176">27</xref></sup> that they say: &#x201C;May it be your will Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, that this blessing which you have commanded us to bless your people, Israel, be a perfect blessing; that there be in it neither stumbling nor iniquity from now and forever.&#x201D; And they should prolong this prayer until the <italic>Chazzan</italic> concludes with: <italic>Ulecha na&#x2019;eh lehodos,</italic> so that the congregation may respond <italic>amein</italic> also to this prayer. The <italic>Chazzan</italic> says: <italic>Elokainu v&#x2019;Eilokei avoseinu barecheinu vaberachah</italic> etc. quietly, but the word <italic>kohanim</italic> he says in a loud voice, for with this he calls the <italic>kohanim</italic> to bless (the people). And then he says quietly: <italic>am kedoshecha ka&#x2019;amur</italic> &#x201C;Your holy people, as it is said.&#x201D; And after the <italic>Chazzan</italic> proclaims: <italic>kohanim,</italic> they begin the berachah, all saying in unison &#x201C;<italic>Baruch atah Adonoy, Elokeine Melech ha&#x2019;olam, asher kiddeshanu, bikedushaso shel Aharon</italic>,&#x201D; then, turning around facing the people<sup><xref rid="fn177">28</xref></sup> they complete the berachah &#x201C;<italic>vetsivanu levareich es amo Yisrael be&#x2019;ahavah</italic>,&#x201D; and the congregation responds <italic>amein.</italic> But the <italic>Chazzan</italic> should not respond <italic>amein,</italic> for this would constitute an interruption (in his prayer). From the words &#x201C;With love,&#x201D; it is infered, that if the worshippers hate the <italic>kohein,</italic> or the <italic>kohein</italic> hates the worshippers, he should not bless them. In fact, it is dangerous for the <italic>kohein</italic> to bless them (under such circumstances). Therefore, he should leave the synagogue (at that time). If there is only one <italic>kohein</italic><sup><xref rid="fn178">29</xref></sup> in the synagogue, the <italic>Chazzan</italic> should not say, <italic>kohanim</italic> in a loud voice, but the <italic>kohein</italic> should, on his own, turn around to face the congregants.</p>
<p>9) They raise their hands to the level of their shoulders<sup><xref rid="fn179">30</xref></sup> and stretch them out, and separate their fingers in such a way that there are five spaces between them. That is, between two fingers and two fingers there is one space, and between the two fingers and the thumb, there is another space, and the same with the other hand; making four spaces. And between the two thumbs there is another space, which makes a total of five spaces.<sup><xref rid="fn180">31</xref></sup> This must be done, because it is written, &#x201C;He is peering through the lattices,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn181">32</xref></sup> five open spaces.<sup><xref rid="fn182">33</xref></sup> He must be careful that his thumbs should not touch each other, so that there will be five spaces. He must raise his right hand slightly above the left and the right thumb should be above the left thumb. They should spread out their hands in such a way that the palms of their hands are turned toward the ground, and the back of their hands toward Heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn183">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>10) When the <italic>kohanim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn184">35</xref></sup> bless the people, they should not look around, nor should they cause their mind to stray; but their eyes should be directed downward as in prayer.<sup><xref rid="fn185">36</xref></sup> The people should concentrate on the blessing, and face the <italic>kohanim,</italic> but they should not gaze at them,<sup><xref rid="fn186">37</xref></sup> neither should the <italic>kohanim</italic> gaze at their hands. It is [therefore] their custom to lower the <italic>tallis</italic> over their faces, extending their hands outside the <italic>tallis.</italic> The worshippers also lower their <italic>tallissim</italic> over their faces in order not to gaze at the <italic>kohanim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn187">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>11) The people standing behind the <italic>kohanim,</italic> are not included in the blessing,<sup><xref rid="fn188">39</xref></sup> unless they were compelled to stand there, but those standing on the sides facing (the <italic>kohanim</italic>) are included in the blessing. In a synagogue where the Holy Ark projects from the wall, the men standing near the eastern wall, on the sides behind the <italic>kohanim,</italic> should leave their places and stand in a place where they will be at least on the sides facing the <italic>kohanim.</italic> If this is not possible, they are considered as being compelled to do so, and are included in the blessing.</p>
<p>12) The <italic>Chazzan</italic> reads<sup><xref rid="fn189">40</xref></sup> to them the <italic>Birkas Kohanim</italic> word for word, and they repeat each word after him until the conclusion of the first verse, whereupon the congregation responds <italic>amein.</italic> [In this manner, the <italic>Chazzan</italic> reads the second and third verses as well.] After the second verse and after the third verse, [the congregation also responds <italic>amein</italic>.] The <italic>Chazzan</italic> should not recite (these verses) from memory but should read them from the <italic>Siddur</italic> in order not to get confused. The <italic>Chazzan,</italic> too, may respond <italic>amein</italic> after these verses.<sup><xref rid="fn190">41</xref></sup> It is not considered an interruption because it is necessary to the prayer. When reciting the following words, the <italic>kohanim</italic> turn (partially) toward the South and then to the North: <italic>yevarechecha, veyishmerecha, eilecha</italic> [&#x201C;May He bless you&#x201D; &#x201C;and safeguard you,&#x201D; &#x201C;to you&#x201D;] <italic>vichuneka, eilecha,</italic> and <italic>lecha,</italic> [&#x201C;and be gracious to you&#x201D; to you&#x201D; &#x201C;you&#x201D;] because these words are in the second person. therefore, the <italic>kohanim</italic> turn also toward the sides, in order to bless the entire congregation. They also turn thus when saying the word <italic>shalom,</italic> because it is the conclusion of the blessings. While the <italic>kohanim</italic> prolong the slow chant before saying the concluding words of each verse, which are <italic>ve&#x2019;yishmerecha, vichuneka</italic> and <italic>shalom,</italic> the congregation recites (the prayer) <italic>Ribono shel olam</italic> etc. &#x201C;Master of the Universe &#x2026;&#x201D; The one who prompts the <italic>kohanim,</italic> even though he is not the <italic>Chazzan,</italic> should not recite <italic>Ribono shel olam,</italic> in order not to get confused. Certainly the <italic>Chazzan</italic> should not recite it because it would be considered an interruption of the <italic>Shemoneh esreih.</italic> The <italic>kohanim</italic> should chant only the customary melody in order to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>13) When the <italic>kohanim</italic> recite the words (of the <italic>Birkas Kohanim</italic>),the congregants should not recite any verse, but should listen very attentively to the words pronounced by the <italic>kohanim;</italic> for is there a slave who, while receiving a blessing, would not listen attentively to his blessing?<sup><xref rid="fn191">42</xref></sup> But if the worshippers recite verses, they cannot concentrate on the blessing. However, some are accustomed to recite various verses, and they must be careful to recite them only when the <italic>Chazzan</italic> or <italic>kohanim</italic> are chanting but not when they are saying the words.</p>
<p>14) After the conclusion of the <italic>Birkas Kohanim, the Chazzan</italic> begins reciting <italic>Sim shalom,</italic> and then the <italic>kohanim</italic> turn their faces toward the Holy Ark in the East, and say, <italic>Ribon Ha&#x2019;olamin</italic> etc. &#x201C;Master of the Universe,&#x201D; and they prolong this prayer until the <italic>Chazzan</italic> concludes the berachah <italic>Hamevareich es Amo Yisrael bashalom</italic> [&#x201C;Who blesses His people Israel with peace,&#x201D;] so that the congregation should respond <italic>amein</italic> to their prayer as well.<sup><xref rid="fn192">43</xref></sup> If they are unable to prolong this prayer until then, they should also recite, <italic>Adir bamarom.</italic> [&#x201C;Mighty One on high.&#x201D;] On Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur when everyone sings <italic>Hayom te&#x2019;amtzeinu</italic> [&#x201C;Strengthen us this day,&#x201D;] the <italic>kohanim</italic> should not begin reciting <italic>Ribon Ha&#x2019;olamim</italic> until that prayer is nearly ended, in order to finish at the same time as the <italic>Chazzan.</italic></p>
<p>15) The <italic>kohanim</italic> are not permitted to begin the berachah <italic>Asher kiddeshanu</italic> etc. until the <italic>Chazzan</italic> completely finishes the word <italic>kohanim.</italic> The <italic>Chazzan</italic> is not permitted to begin saying <italic>yevarechecha</italic> until the entire<sup><xref rid="fn193">44</xref></sup> congregation finishes answering <italic>amein.</italic> The same applies to the <italic>amein</italic> the congregation says after <italic>Veyishmerecha, Vichuneka</italic> and <italic>Shalom</italic>. The <italic>Chazzan</italic> must wait and may not begin saying <italic>Ya&#x2019;eir, Yissa</italic> and <italic>Sim Shalom</italic> until after the entire congregation has said<sup><xref rid="fn194">45</xref></sup> <italic>amein</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn195">46</xref></sup> The <italic>kohanim</italic> are not permitted to turn their faces away from the congregation to the Holy Ark until the <italic>chazzan</italic> begins <italic>Sim Shalom.</italic> They are not permitted to relax their fingers from their extended position until they turn their faces away from the congregation. They are not permitted to leave the <italic>duchan</italic> until the congregation<sup><xref rid="fn196">47</xref></sup> responds <italic>amein</italic> after the berachah <italic>Hamevoreich es amo Yisrael bashalom.</italic></p>
<p>16) Whenever the <italic>kohanim</italic> turn around, either at the beginning or at the end of (the <italic>Birkas Kohanim</italic>), they must always turn towards the right. Therefore, at the beginning, when they are standing facing to the East, they should first turn South and then West. After concluding <italic>Birkas Kohanim,</italic> when they turn to face East, they should do so by first turning North. When going down from the <italic>duchan,</italic> their faces should be somewhat towards the Holy Ark, and they should walk backwards, like a pupil taking leave of his master. When putting on their shoes, they should not touch them. If they did touch them, they must wash their hands.<sup><xref rid="fn197">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>17) An effort should be made to have a <italic>Chazzan,</italic> who is not a <italic>kohein.</italic> If he is a <italic>kohein,</italic> he should not go up to <italic>duchan,</italic> and should not prompt the <italic>kohanim,</italic> but someone else should stand alongside him to call <italic>kohanim.</italic> He should also read to them the words <italic>Yevarechecha</italic> etc. and the <italic>Chazzan</italic> should remain silent, until <italic>Sim Shalom.</italic> He commits no sin by not going up to bless the people, even though the other man called out <italic>kohanim,</italic> because this call is intended only for a <italic>kohein</italic> who is not engaged in prayer, and who moved from his place during <italic>Retzeih.</italic> If he is the only <italic>kohein</italic> present, then, in order not to forego the mitzvah of the priestly blessings, he should go up to the <italic>duchan</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn198">49</xref></sup> relying on his hand-washing in the morning. How should he act? He should move his feet slightly while saying <italic>Retzeih,</italic> and continue until <italic>Ulecha na&#x2019;eh lehodos.</italic> [&#x201C;And to You it is fitting to give thanks.&#x201D;] Then someone else says, <italic>Elokeinu veilokei avoseinu barecheinu vaberachah;</italic> the <italic>Chazzan</italic> then goes up to the <italic>duchan,</italic> while the other man prompts him. After this, the <italic>Chazzan</italic> resumes and recites <italic>Sim Shalom,</italic> but does not say <italic>Ribon Ha&#x2019;olamim</italic> until after reciting the <italic>kaddish.</italic> If he did not move his feet while reciting <italic>Retzeih,</italic> he is not permitted to go up to the <italic>duchan.</italic></p>
<p>18) If a congregation consists of <italic>kohanim</italic> only, then, if there are no more than ten men, they all go up to the <italic>duchan.</italic> Whom do they bless? Their brethren in the fields (countryside). And who responds, <italic>amein?</italic> The women and the little children. Even if there are no women and children, the lack of the <italic>amein</italic> response is not an obstacle. If there are more than ten <italic>kohanim</italic> present, then as many as there are in excess of ten go up to the <italic>duchan,</italic> and ten should remain to respond <italic>amein</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn199">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>19) A <italic>kohein</italic> who had already blessed the congregation, and, afterwards, went to another synagogue, if he wishes to do so, he may go up to the <italic>duchan</italic> again, but if he does not wish to do so, even if he heard the call <italic>kohanim,</italic> he is not obligated to go up, since he has already gone up [and fulfilled his obligation.]</p>
<p>20) In our communities where it is customary for all <italic>kohanim</italic> to lower their <italic>tallisim</italic> over their faces, a <italic>kohein</italic> who has a blemish on his face, is permitted to pronounce the <italic>Birkas Kohanim.</italic> But a <italic>kohein</italic> who has a defect on his hands, like <italic>bahakaniyos,</italic> i.e. a white lesion, or they are speckled with small spots, or they are deformed, or he is unable to separate his fingers, may not bless the people,<sup><xref rid="fn200">51</xref></sup> because the people might look at him, and be distracted. If he is well-known in his town, having lived there for thirty days,<sup><xref rid="fn201">52</xref></sup> and people recognize him, he may raise his hands to bless the people. If his hands are discolored from dye or paint, he may not raise his hands to bless the people because the people will look at them. If most of the people of the town follow this trade [of dyeing or painting], he is permitted to raise his hands in blessing. If he does not know how to pronounce the letters properly, or if he pronounces the letter <italic>shin</italic> like the letter <italic>sin,</italic> he may not raise his hands to bless the people, unless the entire congregation<sup><xref rid="fn202">53</xref></sup> pronounces it like that. Any <italic>kohein,</italic> who does not raise his hands for the <italic>Birkas Kohanim,</italic> should leave the synagogue before <italic>Retzeih</italic> is said, [and stay outside] until the end of the priestly blessing.<sup><xref rid="fn203">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>21) A <italic>kohein,</italic> who once intentionally killed someone, even though he has repented, may not raise his hands to bless the people.<sup><xref rid="fn204">55</xref></sup> If he accidentally killed someone, and has repented, he may raise his hands. Similarly, an apostate<sup><xref rid="fn205">56</xref></sup> who repented, may raise his hands to bless the people. A <italic>kohein</italic> who married a divorcee, or a <italic>chalutzah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn206">57</xref></sup>, or who became ritually unclean by contact with a corpse,<sup><xref rid="fn207">58</xref></sup> for whom he is forbidden to defile himself, may not raise his hands until he repents under the direction of a Torah scholar. Other transgressions do not disqualify a <italic>kohein</italic> from raising his hands. A <italic>chalal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn208">59</xref></sup> may not raise his hands to bless the people.<sup><xref rid="fn209">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>22) A mourner, before burial takes place, may not raise his hands.<sup><xref rid="fn210">61</xref></sup> A mourner, during the twelve months of mourning for his father or mother, or, during the thirty days of mourning for other relatives, may not raise his hands.<sup><xref rid="fn211">62</xref></sup> He must leave the synagogue before <italic>Retzeih</italic> is said, and stay outside until after <italic>Birkas Kohanim.</italic> In the event there are no other <italic>kohanim</italic> in the synagogue, the mourner is permitted to raise his hands during the twelve month period of mourning, for his father or mother, or during the thirty days of mourning for other relatives. But during the seven days of mourning, for example, if he buried his dead on the Festival, even if there are no other <italic>kohanim,</italic> he may not raise his hands to bless the people.</p>
<ftnote id="fn150">1. Even in our times. (See <italic>Magein Avraham</italic> 128:41, <italic>Peri Megadim</italic> etc., unlike the <italic>Penei Yehoshua, Maseches Kesubos</italic> 24b and <italic>Yeshuos Yaakov,</italic> who assert that it is <italic>de&#x2019;oraisa</italic> only in the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>.)</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn156">7. This is the custom throughout most of the Diaspora. In Eretz Yisroel, some cities have the blessings on Shabbos, too, while in Jerusalem they are pronounced daily.

<title>Chapter 101 Laws Concerning Preparation on the First Day of Yom Tov for the Second Day or for a Weekday</title>
<p>1) All <italic>Melachah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn212">1</xref></sup> that is permitted on Yom Tov is permitted only if it is necessary for that day. But to prepare on the first day of Yom Tov for the second day,<sup><xref rid="fn213">2</xref></sup> (even of Rosh Hashanah), and certainly for a weekday, is forbidden. However, if you need to cook for that day, you are permitted to take a larger pot and fill it with meat or something similar, even though you do not need so much for that day, and leave some for the evening, or for the next day.<sup><xref rid="fn214">3</xref></sup> Only in the case of cooked food, is this permitted. because it tastes better when a large quantity of meat is cooked in one pot.<sup><xref rid="fn215">4</xref></sup> This is permitted provided you do not expressly state that the leftovers will be for the night, or for the following day. It should be cooked without mentioning anything at all.<sup><xref rid="fn216">5</xref></sup> In the case of other foods, it is forbidden to add (to that day&#x2019;s needs), if even a little additional labor is entailed. because of adding to it.</p>
<p>2) Even something that is not actual work, such as bringing in water, or even wine for <italic>kiddush</italic> and <italic>havdalah,</italic> is forbidden if it is for the next day. It is also forbidden to put the candles in the candlesticks, or to prepare the wicks and lamps on the first day of Yom Tov, for the night (of the second day of Yom Tov), unless they are needed also before the night,<sup><xref rid="fn217">6</xref></sup> or they are lit in honor of the synagogue.</p>
<p>3) If a non-Jew brings fish or fruit on the first day of Yom Tov, and there is reason to suspect that the fish were caught, or the fruit was picked on that day, or brought in from outside the <italic>Techum</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn218">7</xref></sup> it is forbidden to handle them on that day. In the evening on the second night of Yom Tov<sup><xref rid="fn219">8</xref></sup> it is permitted to use them. Thus, if the non-Jew knows you, and gives them to you without quoting a price, you may take them and eat them; except on Rosh Hashanah, when, even if they were brought on the first day, they are forbidden on the second day.<sup><xref rid="fn220">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>4) If the non-Jew brings these things, as a gift for a Jew or to sell them to him, they are forbidden even on the second day of Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn221">10</xref> <xref rid="fn222">11</xref></sup> If Yom Tov occurs on Thursday and Friday, and the non-Jew brings them on Thursday, if it is very urgent,<sup><xref rid="fn223">12</xref></sup> you are permitted to handle them<sup><xref rid="fn224">13</xref></sup> on Friday, and cook them in honor of Shabbos.<sup><xref rid="fn225">14</xref></sup> On the Yom Tov of Rosh Hashanah, even this, is forbidden.</p>
<p>5) Milk which non-Jew milks on the first day of Yom Tov, in the presence of a Jew, may be used on the second day of Yom Tov. If the milking was done on Shabbos, and Sunday is the first day of Yom Tov, it is forbidden on Sunday. Milk that was milked on the first day of Rosh Hashanah, is also forbidden on the second day, and also on the Shabbos if it follows immediately.</p>
<p>6) Wicks that were lit on the first (night of) Yom Tov and were extinguished, may be lit on the second day of Yom Tov. But, on the two days of Rosh Hashanah it is forbidden to light a wick on the second day that was extinguished on the first day. It is forbidden to light them even at the other end.<sup><xref rid="fn226">15</xref></sup> However, you are allowed to handle them in order to remove and replace them.<sup><xref rid="fn227">16</xref></sup> The same law applies when Yom Tov occurs the day after Shabbos.<sup><xref rid="fn228">17</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn212">1. This includes even such chores that are not halachically considered <italic>melachos.</italic> See paragraph 2. (<italic>Magein Avraham, Mishnah Berurah</italic> 503:1)</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn214">3. <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 503:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn215">4. The <italic>halachah</italic> is, that if you put it on the fire at one time, you are permitted to do so with all foods, since you are not performing additional labor, once it is on the fire. Regarding meat dishes, however, you are permitted to add to the pot even after it is on the fire. (<italic>Magein Avraham</italic> 503:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn216">5. If you have already eaten that day, you may not cook a pot for the following day, even if you eat a piece of it today. (<italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 503:1) If you intentionally did it anyway, you may use it if you eat a piece of it today. (<italic>Magein Avraham, Beis Meir, Shulchan Aruch Harav</italic>) <italic>Eliyahu Rabbah</italic> rules that it is permitted, even if you intended to eat a piece of it, but ended up not doing so. <italic>Peri Chadash</italic> and <italic>Vilna Gaon</italic> rule, even if you eat a piece of it, it is forbidden, for it was done with dishonest intent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn217">6. If it will be difficult to obtain wine at night, you may bring it when it is still day, if it is for a <italic>mitzvah.</italic> (second night of Yom Tov or Shabbos) (<italic>Chayei Adam</italic> 153:6.)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn218">7. See glossary and Chapter 65. If the non-Jew is living in your city and is known to have the items in stock within the <italic>techum,</italic> you may assume what he has brought is from within the <italic>techum</italic>. (<italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 515:7)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn219">8. Immediately after nightfall. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 515:59)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn220">9. This refers only to where it may have been harvested or caught on that day for these are <italic>melachos.</italic> But if there is only concern that they may have been brought in from outside the <italic>techum,</italic> they are permitted on the second day, even if they were brought for a Jew and even if it is <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> or Shabbos, but you must wait for the time it would take the non-Jew to bring it from that place after nightfall.(see <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 515:8, <italic>Vilna Gaon, Mishna Berurah</italic> 515:66)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn221">10. <italic>Ramah</italic> 515:1, <italic>Rabheinu Tam.</italic> However, it is permitted for guests who were unexpected when the non-Jew brought it, or for out-of-town guests.

<ftnote id="fn222">11. This is only in cases where a <italic>melachah</italic> is involved, but where the <italic>techum</italic> is concerned, the <italic>poskim</italic> are lenient, as is the <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic>. (<italic>Ramah</italic> 515:5, <italic>Mishnah Berurah)</italic> The <italic>Misgeros Hashulchan</italic> says the grouping together of <italic>techum</italic> and <italic>melachah</italic> in paragraphs 3 and 4 may be a typographical error in the <italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch,</italic> for it is explicit in the <italic>Talmud</italic> and <italic>poskim</italic> that they are not the same. See footnote 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn223">12. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 515:42 says if you need it in honor of Shabbos, and you have no other food of this type in your house, it is also permitted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn224">13. If you do have more of this type of food in your house, you may still have it cooked for Shabbos by a non-Jew, but you should not handle it. (<italic>Magein Avraham, Eliyahu Rabbah, Mishnah Berurah</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn225">14. You must wait on Friday night, however, until after &#x201C;due time&#x201D; elapses. (<italic>Beis Yosef, Mishnah Berurah</italic> 515:40)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn226">15. <italic>Taz</italic> 501:7. The reason is, since a charred wick lights better than an uncharred one, the wick has been prepared from one day <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> to the second day. The <italic>Ramah, Rosh, Or Zarua, Meiri</italic> etc. permit it because it is possible to light an uncharred wick so it is not considered preparation. The <italic>Peri Chadash</italic> and <italic>Eliyahu Rabbah</italic> say those who are stringent will be blessed. The <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> says that you should try to be stringent and prepare different wicks in advance (before <italic>Rosh Hashanah)</italic> and if not, at least light the other end. <italic>The Shaar Hatziyun</italic> 501:43 permits lighting the uncharred end. The <italic>Taz</italic> forbids this to ensure you do not light the charred tip.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn227">16. You may handle them in order to use them or if you need the space they occupy.

<title>Chapter 102 The Laws of Eiruv Tavshilin</title>
<p>1) When Yom Tov occurs on Friday, it is forbidden to bake or cook in a separate pot for Shabbos, unless you make an <italic>eiruv tavshilin</italic> on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn229">1</xref> <xref rid="fn230">2</xref></sup> This is done as follows: Take some cooked or roasted food that is eaten with bread, and take bread with it,<sup><xref rid="fn231">3</xref></sup> and recite the berachah <italic>Asher kideshanu bemitzvosav</italic> [&#x201C;Who has sanctified us with the commandments] <italic>vetzivanu al mitzvas eiruv.</italic> [&#x201C;and commanded us concerning the mitzvah of <italic>eiruv.</italic>&#x201D;] And declare: &#x201C;By means of this <italic>eiruv</italic> it will be permissible for us to bake, cook, keep food warm, kindle a light and do anything necessary on Yom Tov for the sake of Shabbos.&#x201D; If you do not understand this language, you should say it in the language you understand.</p>
<p>2) The cooked food<sup><xref rid="fn232">4</xref></sup> must be the kind usually eaten with bread, like meat, fish or eggs. But food not usually eaten with bread<sup><xref rid="fn233">5</xref></sup> is not acceptable (for <italic>eiruv tavshilin</italic>). The required amount of the food is a <italic>kazayis</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn234">6</xref></sup> and of the bread, a <italic>kebeitzah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn235">7</xref> <xref rid="fn236">8</xref></sup> You should take a generous portion in honor of the mitzvah. The bread you use should be a whole<sup><xref rid="fn237">9</xref></sup> loaf and should be placed [on the table], for <italic>lechem mishneh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn238">10</xref></sup> on Shabbos. You should eat it at the third Shabbos meal; since one mitzvah was performed with it, it is appropriate to use it for another mitzvah.</p>
<p>3) An <italic>eiruv tavshilin</italic> is effective in permitting you to prepare all your Shabbos needs on Yom Tov [only when you make the <italic>eiruv</italic>] early in the day; that is, there must be enough time in the day, that should guests arrive, who had not yet eaten that day, they would have enough time to eat and enjoy the food that was prepared on Yom Tov before the onset of twilight. But if there is not enough time (left in the day) to enjoy the benefit of the labor, the <italic>eiruv tavshilin</italic> is not effective.<sup><xref rid="fn239">11</xref></sup> Therefore, it is customary, when Yom Tov occurs on Friday, to begin <italic>Maariv</italic> prayers Friday night earlier than usual, while it is still daytime,<sup><xref rid="fn240">12</xref></sup> so that people will hurry to complete all their work before the congregation recites, <italic>Mizmor shir leyom haShabbos.</italic> The cooked dishes that you want to keep warm for Shabbos, should be put in the oven to warm while it is still broad daylight, so that before twilight, at least one third of the cooking<sup><xref rid="fn241">13</xref></sup> should be done.</p>
<p>4) You are permitted to bake and to cook by means of an <italic>eiruv tavshilin</italic> only on Friday. If Yom Tov occurs on Thursday and Friday, you are forbidden to cook or bake anything on Thursday for Shabbos.<sup><xref rid="fn242">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>5) The <italic>eiruv</italic> must remain in tact until you have prepared all your Shabbos needs.<sup><xref rid="fn243">15</xref></sup> If the bread (of the <italic>eiruv</italic>) was lost or eaten, it also does not matter; and you are allowed even to bake for Shabbos. But if the cooked food was lost or eaten, if a <italic>kazayis</italic> is left it doesn&#x2019;t matter. But if less than a <italic>kazayis</italic> is left, it is forbidden to cook [for Shabbos,] just as if you had made no <italic>eiruv.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn244">16</xref></sup> What should you do if you made no <italic>eiruv?</italic> If you thought of it after the morning (Yom Tov) meal, and in that community there is no other Jew who made an <italic>eiruv,</italic><sup><xref rid="fn245">17</xref></sup> you are perrmitted to cook only one pot,<sup><xref rid="fn246">18</xref></sup> bake only one loaf of bread, and light one<sup><xref rid="fn247">19</xref></sup> candle for Shabbos. If you thought of it before cooking the morning (Yom Tov) meal, you may cook all kinds of foods in a large pot<sup><xref rid="fn248">20</xref></sup> and leave some over for Shabbos. If there is someone there who made an <italic>eiruv,</italic> you should give him as a gift, your flour, meat and all other ingredients. The one who made the <italic>eiruv</italic> acquires possession of these items by lifting them up,<sup><xref rid="fn249">21</xref></sup> and then he may cook and bake for you, even in your house though you did not make an <italic>eiruv.</italic></p>
<p>6) The head of every household is required to make an <italic>eiruv tavshilin</italic> for himself. Even a woman who has no husband, if she knows how to make an <italic>eiruv tavshilin,</italic> is required to make one for herself. It is forbidden to rely on the <italic>eiruv</italic> made by the rabbi of the city. If, because of unavoidable circumstances, you forgot to make an <italic>eiruv tavshilin,</italic> or you made one, but it was lost, then if someone in the city makes an <italic>eiruv,</italic> for everyone in the city, (that is, he gives them a share in the cooked dish and the bread, as is explained in the <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic>) you may rely on such an <italic>eiruv.</italic> But if you forgot out of laziness,<sup><xref rid="fn250">22</xref></sup> or if you meant to rely on this <italic>eiruv</italic> from the start, it is ineffective<sup><xref rid="fn251">23</xref></sup> and you must conduct yourself, according to the laws laid down in paragraph 5 above.</p>
<p>7) If Yom Tov occurs on Thursday and Friday, and on Thursday you remember that you did not make an <italic>eiruv tavshilin,</italic> you may make it on that day, and recite the berachah.<sup><xref rid="fn252">24</xref></sup> Afterwards you should say, &#x201C;If this day is Holy (Yom Tov), then I do not need to make an <italic>eiruv.</italic> And if today is really a weekday, then by means of this <italic>eiruv</italic> etc.&#x201D; On Rosh Hashanah, this cannot be done.</p>
<ftnote id="fn229">1. Even at twilight. (<italic>Ramah</italic> 527:1) After the congregation says <italic>Barechu</italic> at <italic>Maariv,</italic> you may no longer make an <italic>eiruv,</italic> even if it is not yet dark. (<italic>Magein Avraham, Derech Hachaim</italic>) In an urgent situation, you may make the <italic>eiruv</italic> until the congregation says the Yom Tov <italic>Shemoneh Esrei,</italic> according to the ruling of the <italic>Taz</italic>. (<italic>Chayei Adam, Mishnah Berurah</italic> 527:4) If you, accepted the holiness of Yom Tov, on your own, some hold that you may still make an <italic>eiruv.</italic> (see <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> and <italic>Sha&#x2019;ar Hatziyun</italic> 527:9)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn230">2. This is preferable, but it also helps if you made it many days before, in which case you should still recite the declaration at the end of this paragraph (without a berachah). (<italic>Taz, Magein Avraham</italic> 527:13)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn231">3. You only need to take bread if you wish to bake for Shabbos. (<italic>Beis Yosef, Vilna Gaon, Mishnah Berurah</italic> 527:6) In any event, if you only used a cooked food for your <italic>eiruv,</italic> it is sufficient. (<italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 527:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn232">4. You may not use foods that are merely salted, such as salted herring. [<italic>Shulchan Aruch Harav, Chayei Adam</italic> 102:6, <italic>Korban Nessanel</italic> (<italic>Beitzah</italic> 2:9), <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic>] The <italic>Maharsham</italic> 528:7 rules that in the event you used salted fish etc., you may rely on the ruling of the <italic>Chacham Tzvi</italic> 130, <italic>Tz&#x2019;lach</italic> and <italic>Derech Hachaim</italic> who rule that it is sufficient.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn233">5. For example, cooked grain cereals. (<italic>Maseches Beitzah</italic> 16, <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 527:4)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn234">6. See glossary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn235">7. See glossary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn236">8. If you used a <italic>kazayis,</italic> it is also enough, but a <italic>kebeitzah</italic> is better. (<italic>Ramah</italic> 527:3)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn237">9. In order to perform the mitzvah in its excellence. (<italic>Tanya Rabassi</italic> 56)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn238">10. See glossary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn239">11. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 527:3 rules that if you were late in your preparations, you may be lenient on the second day of Yom Tov, and if it is urgent, you may be lenient even on the first day of Yom Tov and rely on the ruling of the <italic>Rambam</italic> and <italic>Ritva.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn240">12. <italic>Eliyahu Rabbah, Levush</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn241">13. <italic>Peri Megadim.</italic> See Chapter 72.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn242">14. <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 527:13. If you did, you may eat it on Shabbos. (<italic>Taz, Eliyahu Rabbah, Mishnah Berurah</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn243">15. If you started preparing food (like cutting vegetables to cook) and then, the <italic>eiruv</italic> was lost, you may continue and complete the preparation of that food.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn244">16. From this it seems that you may not bake, even though the bread was left. If you made a proper <italic>eiruv,</italic> but the cooked component was lost and you are left with the bread alone, <italic>Sha&#x2019;arei Teshuvah</italic> 527:13, and <italic>Penei Yehoshua&#x2019;s</italic> (Responsum 15) rule that if you are lenient and rely on it, you have not done anything wrong. The <italic>Semak</italic> also rules that you may rely on the baked component.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn245">17. <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 527:2. The <italic>Magein Avraham, Darkei Moshe</italic> say that if there is another Jew, you must do as prescribed (at the end of this paragraph) and may not cook even one dish etc., but the <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 527:61 (<italic>Acharonim</italic> (<italic>Reshal</italic> etc.) hold that the choice is yours.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn246">18. Large enough for all your Shabbos needs. Even if you have <italic>challah</italic> in the house, but it is not enough for Shabbos, you may bake one more to meet those needs. (<italic>Sha&#x2019;ar Hatziyun</italic> 527:89)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn247">19. This is in accordance with most <italic>Rishonim</italic> who require an <italic>eiruv</italic> in order to light the Shabbos candles. <italic>Rambam, Bach, Knesses Hagedolah, Birkei Yosef</italic> etc. permit the lighting of candles even without an <italic>eiruv</italic>. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 527:55 rules that it is proper to be stringent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn248">20. This means each kind may be cooked in a pot large enough to suffice for both Yom Tov and Shabbos.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn249">21. One <italic>tefach</italic> high. (<italic>Shulchan Aruch Harav</italic> 527:28)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn250">22. If you deliberately relied on his <italic>eiruv, Shulchan Aruch</italic> 527:7 rules that it does not help. But <italic>Rambam, Rashba, Ran</italic> etc. say it does. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 527:26 rules that if your (<italic>simchas</italic> Yom Tov) rejoicing on Yom Tov, will be impaired, you, may be lenient and rely on this opinion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn251">23. This applies also to a person who heard that he is obligated to make an <italic>eiruv tavshilin,</italic> but does not know how to make one. He should have asked someone to make it for him. Since he did not, he may not rely on someone else&#x2019;s <italic>eiruv</italic>. (<italic>Radvaz</italic> 3:475) If he thought he was allowed to rely on someone else&#x2019;s <italic>eiruv,</italic> he may rely on it, unless he is a Torah scholar and should have known better. (<italic>Shulchan Aruch Harav</italic> 527:14, <italic>Magein Avraham</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn252">24. But the <italic>Chacham Tzvi, Lechem Setarim, Rabbi Akiva Eiger Ya&#x2019;avetz</italic> (Siddur), <italic>Birkei Yosef</italic> rule that a berachah should not be recited when making a conditional <italic>eiruv,</italic> for it is a <italic>safeik</italic> (doubt) and a berachah is not made when there is a doubt.</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 103 Laws of Rejoicing on Yom Tov</title>
<p>1) Just as it is a mitzvah to honor the Shabbos and delight in it, so it is a mitzvah to honor all the <italic>Yomim Tovim</italic> and delight in them, as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn253">1</xref></sup> &#x201C;God&#x2019;s holy and honored&#x201D; (day).

As our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said, &#x201C;It is a mitzvah for a man to take a haircut on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov so that he does not enter the festival looking untidy. It is also a mitzvah to bathe in warm water, to wash your hair, and to cut your nails on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov, the same as on erev Shabbos. It is also a mitzvah to bake challos in your house on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov in honor of Yom Tov, just as it is on <italic>erev</italic> Shabbos. It is forbidden to<sup><xref rid="fn255">3</xref></sup> eat<sup><xref rid="fn256">4</xref></sup> on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov after<sup><xref rid="fn257">5</xref></sup> <italic>Minchah,</italic><sup><xref rid="fn258">6</xref></sup> just as on <italic>erev</italic> Shabbos, so that you will be able to eat the Yom Tov meal with good appetite. And if <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov occurs on Shabbos, you must eat the third meal before <italic>Minchah ketanah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn259">7</xref></sup> This law also applies to the first day of Yom Tov, since it is the <italic>eve</italic> of the second day of Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn260">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) What is meant by delight? As our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said on each Yom Tov day you must have two meals, one at night and one during the day,<sup><xref rid="fn261">9</xref></sup> but it is not our custom to have a third meal.<sup><xref rid="fn262">10</xref></sup> You are obligated to say <italic>kiddush</italic> over a cup of wine before the meal. You should say <italic>Hamotzi</italic> on two whole loaves as you do on Shabbos,<sup><xref rid="fn263">11</xref></sup> and you should be lavish with meat, wine and sweets, according to your means.</p>
<p>4) On every Yom Tov, at the conclusion of the <italic>kiddush</italic> at night we say the berachah of <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> on the joy of the holiday, except on the seventh and eighth nights of Pesach when <italic>shehecheyanu</italic> is omitted, since they are not a separate Yom Tov in themselves. When lighting the candles, women should not say the berachah <italic>shehecheyanu</italic> on any Yom Tov. Some women follow the custom of saying <italic>shehecheyanu</italic> on all <italic>Yomim Tovim</italic> (except on the seventh and eighth nights of Pesach), and we do not protest their practice.</p>
<p>5) Every man is obligated to gladden the hearts<sup><xref rid="fn264">12</xref></sup> of his wife, his children, and all who are dependent on him, in a way suitable for each. To the little children you should give nuts and candy, to the women,<sup><xref rid="fn265">13</xref></sup> clothing and jewelry according to your means,<sup><xref rid="fn266">14</xref></sup> and to the men, meat and wine.<sup><xref rid="fn267">15</xref></sup> It is the custom to serve a greater variety of foods on Yom Tov than on Shabbos, because with regard to Yom Tov, the Torah mentions &#x201C;rejoicing,&#x201D; but it is not mentioned with regard to Shabbos. Also Yom Tov clothes should be more expensive than Shabbos clothes.</p>
<p>6) On the second day of Pesach, you should add an extra dish to the meal to remember the feast of Esther which took place on this day, for it was on this day that Haman was hanged.</p>
<p>7) On the first day of Shavuos it is customary to eat dairy foods. There are several reasons for this. A hint of this custom is found in the words, <italic>Minchah chadashah LaShem beshavuoseichem.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn268">16</xref></sup> The initials of these words spell <italic>meichalav</italic>&#x2014;&#x201C;of milk.&#x201D; You should also eat foods with honey, because the Torah is compared to milk and honey, as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn269">17</xref></sup> &#x201C;Honey and milk are under your tongue.&#x201D; Now, since we eat dairy foods and we must also eat meat, because it is a mitzvah to eat meat on every Yom Tov, care must be taken not to violate the law of mixing the dairy and meat foods.</p>
<p>8) Even though eating and drinking on festivals is a positive commandment, you should not spend all day eating and drinking, because it is said, &#x201C;(A day of) restraint (in honor) of Adonoy, your God.&#x201D; Even though it is said, &#x201C;(A day of) restraint it shall be for <italic>you</italic>,&#x201D; our Rabbis, of blessed memory, explained:<sup><xref rid="fn270">18</xref></sup> The day should be divided, half devoted to Hashem and half to yourself. Therefore, it is your duty to engage also in the study of Torah.</p>
<p>9) And when you eat and drink, it is your duty to provide also for the orphan, the widow and other needy people, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Levite, the proselyte, and the orphan etc&#x2026;.&#x201D; (<italic>Deuteronomy</italic> 16:14). He who locks the doors of his courtyard, and eats and drinks with his wife and children and does not give food and drink to the poor and unhappy souls, is not rejoicing in a mitzvah, but rejoicing in his gluttony. Concerning such people it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn271">19</xref></sup> &#x201C;Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners; all who eat of them will be unclean; for their bread will be for their souls.&#x201D; And such rejoicing is a disgrace for them as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn272">20</xref></sup> &#x201C;I will spread dung on your faces, the dung of your festival offerings.&#x201D;</p>
<p>10) When a person eats and drinks, and rejoices on the festival, he should not overindulge in drinking wine, in laughter and lightheadedness, thinking that the more he indulges, the greater will be the mitzvah of rejoicing. For drunkenness, mockery and lightheadedness is not rejoicing, but licentiousness and foolishness. And we were not commanded to act licentiously and foolishly, but to rejoice in the service of the Creator of all things, as it is said, &#x201C;Because you did not serve Adonoy, your God, with happiness and a glad heart, when you had plenty of everything.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn273">21</xref></sup> From this we infer that the service of God must be done with joy, but you cannot serve God in frivolity, or lightheadness or in drunkenness.</p>
<p>11) It is the way of the pious, who constantly have God before them, and who are mindful of Him in all their ways, when they rejoice, to greatly bless and praise the Holy One Blessed is He Who enabled them to rejoice. A man should say to himself at the time of his rejoicing and pleasure, &#x201C;If the happiness of this world is so great, (a world) which is vanity because it ends in grief and sorrow, how great will be the eternal joy of the World to Come which is not followed by grief.&#x201D; And he should pray to the Holy One Blessed is He that He bend his heart to serve Him and to do His will wholeheartedly, and that He should gladden us with everlasting joy, and make us worthy of the life of the World to Come, to be enlightened by the light of the presence of the Living King.</p>
<p>12) Every man is obligated to prevent<sup><xref rid="fn274">22</xref></sup> the members of his household from congregating in places which, Heaven forbid, could lead to levity, through association with lightheaded people. They should be encouraged to be holy because the day is holy.</p>
<p>13) At the conclusion of a Yom Tov that is followed by a weekday or <italic>Chol Hamoed, Atah chonantanu</italic> is said in the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei,</italic> and <italic>Havdalah</italic> is said over a cup [of wine.] However, the berachah is not said over the candle, or over the spices.</p>
<p>14) It is customary to eat and drink a bit more lavishly [than usual] on the day after all three festivals. That day is called <italic>Isru chag,</italic> and it is customary not to fast on that day. Even a groom and bride on their wedding day [do not fast], and a person observing <italic>yahrzeit</italic> [should also not fast on <italic>Isru chag</italic>]. On <italic>Isru chag</italic> following Shavuos, even according to <italic>halachah,</italic> it is forbidden to fast, because when the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> was in existence, if Shavuos occurred on Shabbos, the sacrifices were offered on the following day. But on Pesach and Sukkos, they were offered on the first day of <italic>Chol Hamoed.</italic></p>

<title>Chapter 104 Laws of Chol Hamoed (Intermediate Days of a Yom Tov)</title>
<p>1) On <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic> it is forbidden to do certain <italic>melachos,</italic><sup><xref rid="fn275">1</xref></sup> while others are permitted, namely, all work that is necessary for the preparation of food<sup><xref rid="fn276">2</xref></sup> for <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic> or Yom Tov. Any <italic>melachah</italic> that is done to prevent a loss, that is, if by not doing it you will incur a loss,<sup><xref rid="fn277">3</xref></sup> may be done.<sup><xref rid="fn278">4</xref></sup> But you should be very careful not to do any <italic>melachah</italic> that is forbidden on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic> because our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said: &#x201C;He who desecrates <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic> is considered as though he worshipped idols.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn279">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) In addition, our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said:<sup><xref rid="fn280">6</xref></sup> &#x201C;He who disgraces <italic>Chol Hamoed,</italic> even though he has to his credit Torah and good deeds, has no share in the World to Come.&#x201D; Disgracing <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic> implies not honoring it with better food and wearing better clothes.<sup><xref rid="fn281">7</xref></sup> Therefore, every man is obligated to honor it according to his means,<sup><xref rid="fn282">8</xref></sup> and to wear dignified clothing.</p>
<p>3) Work, which, if not done, would result in a loss, may be done even by another Jew, even for payment.<sup><xref rid="fn283">9</xref></sup> But, if no loss would result, but the work is needed for the festival, it should not be done by another Jew for pay, but by a non-Jew.<sup><xref rid="fn284">10</xref></sup> And if you cannot find a non-Jew, and you are unable to do it yourself, it is permitted<sup><xref rid="fn285">11</xref></sup> to have it done, even by a Jew for pay.</p>
<p>4) The law that permits <italic>melachah</italic> in order to prevent a loss, applies only if it was impossible<sup><xref rid="fn286">12</xref></sup> for you to do it before Yom Tov, but if it was possible for you to do it before Yom Tov, and you left it for <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn287">13</xref></sup> you are forbidden to do it on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn288">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>5) Any work that is forbidden on <italic>Chol Hamoed,</italic> [is permitted in the following circumstances,] if a Jew does not have enough food for <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic> and Yom Tov,<sup><xref rid="fn289">15</xref></sup> it is permitted to give him work, so that he will have something to eat, but he should do it in private.<sup><xref rid="fn290">16</xref></sup> It is forbidden to have such work done by a non-Jew,<sup><xref rid="fn291">17</xref></sup> but if it is needed for a mitzvah, it is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn292">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) Even <italic>melachos</italic> that are permitted, are forbidden to be done for a non-Jew.<sup><xref rid="fn293">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>7) It is forbidden to fertilize a field.<sup><xref rid="fn294">20</xref></sup> Even to put sheep in a field to fertilize it with manure is forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn295">21</xref></sup> Even to have it done by a non-Jew is forbidden.</p>
<p>8) Planting is forbidden. However if you have seeds that will spoil completely, unless they are put into water, you are permitted to water [soak] them.<sup><xref rid="fn296">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>9) It is forbidden to pluck or cut off anything that is growing, unless the fruit will spoil<sup><xref rid="fn297">23</xref></sup> [if left] until after Yom Tov. It is permitted to pluck what you need to eat on Yom Tov, and you do not have to skimp. You may pick a generous quantity, and if there is some left over, it does not matter.<sup><xref rid="fn298">24</xref></sup> Also, wood that is needed for heating on the festival, is permitted to be cut from a growing tree. If it is necessary to pick something in order to feed your animals, it should be done in an irregular way. It is forbidden to collect wood from a field in order to improve it for plowing. But if it is obvious that you intend it for your own need, because you need the wood, for example, if you take the big pieces and leave the small ones, it is permissible. Similarly, it is forbidden to cut off the (soft) branches of a tree in order to trim it. But if it is obvious that your purpose is to feed the branches to your animals, and not to trim the tree, for example, if you cut all the branches from one side of the tree, it is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn299">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>10) If you have a garden adjacent to a garden of a non-Jew, and the non-Jew is gathering his fruit, and if you do not gather (your fruit), you will incur a loss, you are permitted to gather them.<sup><xref rid="fn300">26</xref></sup> And if they are fruits that will spoil when they are picked, unless you do additional <italic>melachah,</italic> you are permitted to do everything [that is necessary] even to press grapes to make wine or similar <italic>melachos,</italic> provided you did not intentionally leave this work to be done on <italic>Chol Hamoed.</italic></p>
<p>11) It is forbidden to shave<sup><xref rid="fn301">27</xref></sup> on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn302">28</xref></sup> even if you shaved on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn303">29</xref></sup> But a person who has been released from jail,<sup><xref rid="fn304">30</xref></sup> even if he was released <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov, but had no time<sup><xref rid="fn305">31</xref></sup> to shave then, is permitted to shave on <italic>Chol Hamoed.</italic></p>
<p>12) Cutting your nails is also<sup><xref rid="fn306">32</xref></sup> forbidden,<sup><xref rid="fn307">33</xref></sup> but if you cut them on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov, you are permitted to cut them also on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn308">34</xref></sup> A woman is also permitted (to cut her nails) for the ritual immersion.<sup><xref rid="fn309">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>13) It is forbidden to launder anything, even (clothes) needed for the festivals,<sup><xref rid="fn310">36</xref></sup> unless it was impossible to wash them before Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn311">37</xref></sup> Since (babies) urinate all the time, and you need many diapers,<sup><xref rid="fn312">38</xref></sup> you are permitted to wash them, but you should be careful to wash them in privacy.<sup><xref rid="fn313">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>14) Anything required to restore health, is permitted to be done, either for man<sup><xref rid="fn314">40</xref></sup> or beast.</p>
<p>15) It is permitted to record bills and similar records which, if not recorded will be forgotten because it is considered prevention of a loss.<sup><xref rid="fn315">41</xref></sup> You are permitted to write<sup><xref rid="fn316">42</xref></sup> whatever is necessary for the needs of Yom Tov, but it is forbidden to write anything else. Social letters that friends write to each other, should be written with a slight change,<sup><xref rid="fn317">43</xref></sup> like writing the first line unevenly.<sup><xref rid="fn318">44</xref></sup> For everything that you are permitted to write, you are also permitted to prepare a pen and ink.</p>
<p>16) A person who needs money, even if not for Yom Tov needs, and is afraid that he might not get a loan after Yom Tov, and the lender refuses to give a loan without receiving a note, is permitted to write such a note.<sup><xref rid="fn319">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>17) Weddings are not performed on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn320">46</xref></sup> because one kind of rejoicing<sup><xref rid="fn321">47</xref></sup> should not be mixed with another. But one is permitted to remarry the woman he divorced.<sup><xref rid="fn322">48</xref></sup> It is permitted to make a feast for a circumcision, or the redemption of a firstborn. It is also permitted<sup><xref rid="fn323">49</xref></sup> to make a feast for an engagement.<sup><xref rid="fn324">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>18) It is permitted to hire workers, even Jews,<sup><xref rid="fn325">51</xref></sup> to do work for you after Yom Tov.</p>
<p>19) You are permitted to go outside the <italic>techum,</italic> either on foot or in a vehicle,<sup><xref rid="fn326">52</xref></sup> or on horseback.</p>
<p>20) It is not permitted to mate a male animal with a female animal, because no loss is sustained [by delaying it]</p>
<p>21) You are not allowed to set a chicken on eggs to hatch them. If you set her before the festival and she ran away, if it is within three days from the time she ran away, you are permitted to put her back, but after three days, you are forbidden to put her back, even if the eggs will be spoiled. And to set another in her place, even within three days is forbidden.</p>
<ftnote id="fn275">1. Concerning the halachic status of the prohibition against <italic>melachah</italic> on <italic>Chol Hamoed,</italic> there are two basic views among the early <italic>poskim</italic>. <italic>Rif, Rashi</italic> and others consider it to be a <italic>de&#x2019;oraisa</italic> (a Scriptural prohibition), while <italic>Rambam, Rabeinu Tam</italic> and <italic>Rosh</italic> regard it as an <italic>issur de&#x2019;rabbanan</italic> (A Rabbinic prohibition). It is interesting to note that even <italic>Rif</italic> and <italic>Rashi</italic> concede that this prohibition is unique in that the Sages were granted full authority to determine which forms of work to permit and which to prohibit on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>) (see <italic>Maseches Chagigah</italic> 18:a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn276">2. The preparation of food for Yom Tov may be done even in a professional manner. (<italic>Mishna Berurah</italic>) 530:1</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn277">3. <italic>Nishmas Adam</italic> 105:1 says that according to <italic>Beis Yosef,</italic> if there is only a possibility of incurring a loss, you are not allowed to do a <italic>melachah</italic> to protect yourself. In <italic>Chayei Adam</italic> 106:5, he says that it should be done through a non-Jew in this case. <italic>Magein Avraham</italic> 537, <italic>Ke&#x2019;Sav Sefer</italic> 102, <italic>Maharam Shick</italic> rules that you may do it yourself. <italic>Peri Megadim</italic> rules that it depends if the <italic>melachah</italic> is <italic>de&#x2019;oraisa</italic> or Rabbinic. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 537:1 maintains that if it is likely that you will incur a loss, you may do the <italic>melachah,</italic> but it should be done in private, if possible.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn278">4. This is true only if it does not involve a major imposition. (<italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 537:2) If it does, it is forbidden only if it is a <italic>melachah de&#x2019;oraisa</italic>. (<italic>Machatzis Hashekel</italic> 536:3, <italic>Magein Avraham</italic>) To prevent a major loss, perhaps it is permitted, even if major imposition is involved. (<italic>Peri Magadim</italic> 540:7)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn279">5. This applies even according to those who maintain that a <italic>melachah</italic> on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic> is a Rabbinic prohibition. (see <italic>Magein Avraham</italic> 530 and <italic>Chayei Adam</italic> 106:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn280">6. <italic>Pirkei Avos</italic> 3:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn281">7. <italic>Rashi</italic> and <italic>Bartenura</italic> (<italic>Pirkei Avos</italic>). <italic>Rabbeinu Yonah</italic> and <italic>Sha&#x2019;ar Hakedushah</italic> explain that it means not desecrating <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic> by doing a <italic>melachah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn282">8. See <italic>Sha&#x2019;ar Hatziyun</italic> 530:4. You are obligated to honor it, but not to the extent that you are obligated on Yom Tov. Therefore, although it is meritorious to eat two meals a day with bread, it is not an actual obligation. Also your clothing should be nicer than during the weekdays, but need not be Shabbos clothing. (see <italic>Magein Avraham</italic> 664:3) In our times, many people including Chassidim and Bnei Torah, wear their Shabbos clothing on <italic>Chol Hamoed,</italic> especially in Eretz Yisroel. This was also the custom of the <italic>Maharil.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn283">9. <italic>Ramah</italic> 542:1, <italic>Kol Bo. Rabbeinu Yerucham,</italic> permits this only when done without pay. <italic>Ritva</italic> and <italic>Levush</italic> rule that if you have no other option, you may even pay a Jew. This is also the ruling of <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 542:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn284">10. Or a Jew without pay.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn285">11. <italic>Ritva, Mishnah Berurah</italic> 542:2.</ftnote>

<p>1) It is forbidden to move and carry movable belongings and household utensils on <italic>Chol Hamoed,</italic> from an apartment in one courtyard to an apartment in another courtyard, even from an unattractive apartment to a nice one.<sup><xref rid="fn327">1</xref></sup> But to move these items from one house to another in the same courtyard, is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn328">2</xref></sup> Similarly, if the two courtyards are adjacent to each other, and there is a door between them, it is permitted to take things out through that door. However, if you would otherwise incur a loss, you are permitted to move these articles even from one city to another.<sup><xref rid="fn329">3</xref></sup> Moving from a house that doesn&#x2019;t belong to you to your own house, is permitted, for this is considered rejoicing on Yom Tov, because it is a joy to live in your own home.<sup><xref rid="fn330">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) If you must take in fruit, or other merchandise because you fear it will be stolen, or damaged, it should be done in a secluded manner if possible. If you cannot do it in a secluded manner, you are permitted to do it openly.<sup><xref rid="fn331">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Chapter 106 Buying and Selling During Chol Hamoed</title>
<p>1) All commerce is forbidden,<sup><xref rid="fn332">1</xref></sup> whether buying or selling.<sup><xref rid="fn333">2</xref></sup> However if you have an opportunity to make a big profit,<sup><xref rid="fn334">3</xref></sup> you may buy and sell in private.<sup><xref rid="fn335">4</xref></sup> You should then spend more in honor of Yom Tov than you had previously intended.<sup><xref rid="fn336">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) If you have merchandise and you are afraid that if you don&#x2019;t sell it now, its value will become less than its cost, you are permitted to sell it, because you prevent a loss thereby. However, if there is no fear of sustaining a loss, except that you will not make a profit later, you are forbidden to sell it, because unearned profit is not considered a loss.<sup><xref rid="fn337">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) If a fair occurs on (<italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>), that is, a market day which occurs infrequently, or even the weekly market day, which occurs before the non-Jewish holidays,<sup><xref rid="fn338">7</xref></sup> when many buyers come together, you are permitted to sell in that market. Since it is an irregular occasion, even a lack of profit is considered a loss. But to sell in a regular weekly market is forbidden. Merchants or ships that arrive occasionally, and sell merchandise cheaply, or buy at a high price, which is something that does not happen often, you are then also permitted to buy from them and sell to them.</p>
<p>4) If you need to purchase wine at the time of vintage, for the needs of your household for the entire year, because later the price of wine will go up, you are allowed to buy it on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn339">8</xref></sup> but it is forbidden to buy it for business purposes.<sup><xref rid="fn340">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>5) Things that are needed for the Yom Tov, like fruits and spices,<sup><xref rid="fn341">10</xref></sup> may be sold regularly, even openly. And since you are allowed to open your store to sell to a Jewish customer, you may also sell to a non-Jewish customer.</p>
<p>6) It is customary to be lenient about collecting debts, even when the debt is owed by a Jew, because we consider this the prevention of a loss.<sup><xref rid="fn342">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>7) Lending money on interest to a regular non-Jewish customer is permitted, because it would be a loss, if he took his business elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="fn343">12</xref></sup> If you lend money to a non-Jew, who is not your regular customer, you should spend the interest<sup><xref rid="fn344">13</xref></sup> of one week for [the mitzvah of] rejoicing on Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn345">14</xref></sup> Selling merchandise to someone who is not a regular customer is forbidden, and it is of no avail even if you spend more of your profits for [the mitzvah of] rejoicing on Yom Tov.<sup><xref rid="fn346">15</xref></sup> But you are permitted to sell to a regular customer, because it is considered prevention of a loss, so that he will not get accustomed to purchase elsewhere.</p>
<p>8) It is forbidden to exchange money<sup><xref rid="fn347">16</xref></sup> (on <italic>Chol Hamoed)</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn332">1. The Sages prohibited commerce on <italic>Chol Hamoed,</italic> since it often involves physical or mental stress which detracts from the festival. (<italic>Magein Avraham</italic> 539:1, <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic>) It is also prohibited because of the fear that you might write something that is not permitted to be written on <italic>Chol Hamoed.</italic> (see <italic>Yeshuos Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn333">2. <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 539:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn334">3. In this case, even if the opportunity may be there afterwards, it is permitted, for if the opportunity will be lost, it would be permitted even without the conditions listed. See paragraph 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn335">4. <italic>Ramah</italic> 539:1. This restriction is only in a situation when you have sufficient money, or, according to the <italic>Taz,</italic> when you are extremely wealthy. But if you are not, then you may buy or sell, even openly and for a modest profit; provided you use some of this profit for enjoying the Yom Tov. You also should keep your store gate closed until a customer arrives. (see <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 539:5, 6, 17, 18, <italic>Sha&#x2019;ar Hatziyun</italic> 539:7, <italic>Biur Halachah</italic> 539:4, and <italic>Chayei Adam</italic> 112:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn336">5. <italic>Ramah.</italic> See footnote 4. (<italic>Biur Halachah</italic> 539:5) You are not permitted to do a <italic>melachah</italic> (like cutting material to sell) even under these conditions.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn338">7. Before the non-Jewish holidays there is usually heavy trade.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn339">8. You may not purchase more than one year&#x2019;s supply because it can be purchased again the following year. (<italic>Beis Yosef, Bach, Mishnah Berurah</italic> 539:31)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn340">9. See <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> and <italic>Ramah</italic> 539:9. <italic>Eliyahu Rabbah</italic> rules that buying wine in order to profit is permitted, and only buying large quantities for your own use is prohibited because it is an unnecessary bother. See <italic>Biur Halachah</italic> who says not to protest against those who rely on this opinion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn341">10. <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 539:10 permits their sale because they are perishable. <italic>Magein Avraham</italic> and <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> include non-perishable items as well, provided they are obviously for Yom Tov needs. Anything for Yom Tov that is not obvious, must be done in private. (see <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 533:5)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn342">11. See <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 539:2&#x2013;3. This reason is only necessary for commercial debts such as payment for merchandise (already delivered). These have the <italic>halachah</italic> of commerce, and are allowed only when classified as prevention of loss. Debts from loans, however, are not considered business and you may try to collect them on <italic>Chol Hamoed,</italic> even in court. (see <italic>Taz, Mishnah Berurah</italic> 539:7&#x2013;11) If you have a good security (<span dir="rtl">&#xFB3E;&#x05B7;&#xFB2A;&#x05B0;&#xFB3B;&#xFB4B;&#x05DF;</span>) you may not make your claim in <italic>Beis Din</italic> (court) on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>. (<italic>Eliyahu Rabbah</italic>) When claiming outstanding loans, etc., if they are not considered prevention of loss, you may not do <italic>melachah</italic> (like writing) in the process.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn343">12. <italic>Rabbeinu Tam, Rosh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn344">13. If it was a large loan and you find it difficult to spend so much, you should do the best you can. (<italic>Ba&#x2019;eir Heiteiv, Maharil)</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn345">14. This is in addition to what you had intended to spend. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 539:45)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn346">15. See paragraphs 1&#x2013;2 and footnotes 4&#x2013;5. Lending is less restricted than business because it does not involve the bother of pricing or the disappointment of overpaying. (<italic>Magein Avraham</italic> 539:17, <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 539:45)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn347">16. <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 539:14. Because it is considered business. (<italic>Vilna Gaon, Mishnah Berurah</italic> 539:47)</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn353">6. Aaron, the High Priest, and <italic>Nasi</italic> of the tribe of <italic>Levi</italic> did not take part in the offering of the <italic>Nesi&#x2019;im</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn358">11.

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 108 The Wheat and Flour for the Matzos</title>
<p>1) It is written, &#x201C;And you must guard the matzos&#x201D; (Exodus 12:17). From this we learn that we must guard the wheat [from which we make] the matzos with which we perform the mitzvah, to see that no water comes upon them. According to some of the great <italic>halachic</italic> authorities, of blessed memory, this watchfulness is to begin from the time the wheat is harvested. The prevailing custom is to follow the opinion of the authorities, who maintain it is sufficient to guard it from the time it is brought to the mill, and thereafter. However, people who are meticulous in their performance of mitzvos, are concerned that [the wheat] should be guarded from the time it is harvested, and this is the proper thing to do. Special care must be taken that the stalks do not remain attached to the earth until they completely dry out and turn white, because then if rain falls on them they will become <italic>chametz</italic>, even though they are still attached to the soil,<sup><xref rid="fn361">1</xref></sup> since they no longer need the soil&#x2019;s (nourishment). It is, therefore, fitting and proper to harvest them when they are still slightly green. If you can obtain wheat that was guarded from the time of harvesting for all the days of Yom Tov, so much the better. If this is impossible, you should at least be scrupulous about this for the matzos of both Seder nights.</p>
<p>2) If in some of the wheat there was found kernels that were split open or sprouted; the rest may be used for matzah, provided the unfit ones were separated or carefully measured to make sure that there is at least sixty times as much (of the good wheat) as the split and sprouted (wheat). Initially, you should be scrupulous to sort out even wheat from which mice have eaten, or to make sure that there is at least sixty times as much of the good wheat. Wheat that arrived by ship or was stored in pits, if it is dry and hard, and its color has not changed, is kosher for <italic>Pesach</italic>. If it was stored in an attic and rain dripped upon it in several places, through the roof, it is forbidden. But if a little snow fell on it or a little water, in one place only, you must remove those kernels which are doubtful, and the rest may be used.</p>
<p>3) It is a long established custom in Yisroel, in preparing the mill, to clean it thoroughly, and scrub it in every possible way and to purchase new bags [for the flour.] In a community where there are Torah scholars, they should go to the mill to supervise the cleansing, and to see that the preparations are done properly. In a community where there are no Torah scholars, every God-fearing person should go himself to supervise the preparation of the mill, for it is a greater mitzvah to do it yourself, than if an agent does it for you. It is customary that the first flour milled after this preparation, is not eaten on <italic>Pesach</italic>. If moist grain is also ground at that mill, it should be separated with a partition, so that none of its powder should mix with it.</p>
<p>4) If a bag of flour has become wet, if only one part became wet, whether it is still moist or already dry, you may take that part in your hand while you empty the rest of the flour, which you are permitted to use. Only the part that has become wet is forbidden. However, if the bag of flour has become wet in several places so that it is impossible to take these steps, then, if it is still moist, the flour is sifted and only the pieces that remain in the sieve are <italic>chametz</italic>, but the rest may be used. If mice have eaten some of the flour, it should be sifted. However, if the bag of flour has become dry, sifting is of no use, and the entire flour is forbidden to be used.</p>
<p>5) On the day the flour has been ground it is forbidden to be baked,<sup><xref rid="fn362">2</xref></sup> because the flour is then warm and will quickly become <italic>chametz</italic> when water is poured on it. Therefore, you should postpone using it for at least twenty-four hours after the grinding.</p>
<p>6) The bags for holding the flour preferably should be made new, or at least the seams of the old bags should be opened, and they should be washed thoroughly with warm water and ashes, and by rubbing and beating them.</p>
<p>7) It is forbidden to load a bag of flour on an animal, unless thick leather is placed underneath the bag, as otherwise, it will get warm and moist from perspiration. If possible, you should also be careful not to place many bags one on top of the other, because as a result of that, the flour will be heated, and become <italic>chametz</italic> in the kneading.<sup><xref rid="fn363">3</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn361">1. This is so only if there was a huge downpour of rain, but a slight rain or drizzle does not disqualify the wheat and it may be used even for the required matzo of the Seder. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 467:18)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn362">2. If, however, it was already kneaded with water, it may be baked, but special care must be taken that it not be allowed to become <italic>chametz</italic>. This is done by speeding up the process and getting into the oven even quicker than other matzos. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 453:43)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn363">3. If, however, they were placed one on top of the other, it is necessary to wait at least twenty-four hours before using the wheat. One should also not sit on the bags of flour. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 453:35)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 109 The Laws Concerning the Water (Used for Kneading the Matzos)</title>
<p>1) The flour for the matzos should be kneaded only with water that has stayed overnight,<sup><xref rid="fn364">1</xref></sup> that is to say, it should be drawn during twilight, and left standing overnight. Even if the night is longer than twelve hours, it is forbidden to use it for kneading until daylight, and if the night is short and there are no twelve hours until daylight, we must wait until twelve hours will have passed from the time it has been drawn. Ordinary people are accustomed to begin kneading as soon as it grows light, with water that stayed overnight, even though, as yet twelve hours have not passed. Although there are some authorities who permit this, most of the authorities take the more stringent view. It is necessary, therefore, to be watchful in this matter.</p>
<p>2) If you are unable to estimate the exact time of twilight, you may draw water a little earlier, provided you do not draw it before sunset.<sup><xref rid="fn365">2</xref></sup> It is the custom to strain the water and to cover it, and it must be placed in a cool place. When bringing the water into the house in the morning, you must be careful to keep it out of the sun.</p>
<p>3) You are permitted to draw enough water at one time to last for several days, but the proper way of fulfilling the mitzvah is to draw water daily for the needs of that day. It is the custom not to draw water in an old earthen vessel, even though it is used only for Pesach, unless it is glazed, for the use of an old unglazed vessel cannot be considered an enhancement of the mitzvah. This custom should not be changed.</p>
<p>4) Rivers in the month of Nissan are generally cooler than wells. You should, therefore, draw water from a river. Sometimes, however, the rivers are swollen from the melting snow and the water is not so cold; it is then preferable to draw water from a well.</p>
<p>5) The water should not be drawn by a non-Jew, but by a Jew.<sup><xref rid="fn366">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) You should not put the water in a vessel that has contained honey or fruit juice, unless it has been <italic>kashered</italic> with boiling water. You surely should avoid placing the water into a vessel that had contained food with a sharp taste, even if it was not <italic>chametz</italic>, because on account of the sharpness, the dough will rise faster, and even <italic>kashering</italic> with boiling water will be of no use in such a case. Neither should you put the water into a copper vessel,<sup><xref rid="fn367">4</xref></sup> because it does not keep it as cool as other vessels.</p>
<p>7) If you notice that the water kept overnight is not sufficient, you may add other water,<sup><xref rid="fn368">5</xref></sup> provided most of the water is that which stayed overnight. Initially, it is best that two thirds of the total should consist of the water that stayed overnight. If possible, try to draw the added water from a pump or a covered well, where the sun does not reach.</p>
<p>8) If the matzah is baked on Sunday, the water must be drawn on Thursday evening, because on Friday it is impossible to fix the exact time of twilight. In an extreme circumstance, if the water was not drawn on Thursday, it should be drawn on Friday after the Minchah service, or on Shabbos by a non-Jew.</p>
<p>9) The water held overnight should not be poured out on account of a death that has occurred, or on account of the vernal equinox, because it is said, &#x201C;He who keeps the commandment shall know no evil thing&#x201D; (Ecclesiastes 8:5). Nevertheless, if you know that the vernal equinox will occur, you should put into the water a small, clean piece of metal, something like a needle attached to a thread, so that afterwards you will not have to put your hands into the water to get it out, but you will be able to pull it out by the thread.<sup><xref rid="fn369">6</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn364">1. This applies both to the <italic>matzah shel mitzvah</italic> (which is required eating at the Seder) and to the regular matzos eaten during Pesach. See Chapter 110:15. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 455:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn365">2. Many <italic>Poskim</italic> rule that twilight begins at sunset and according to them, you may draw the water even before sunset.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn366">3. Drawing water for baking matzah is considered part of the mitzvah and should be done only by a Jew. This <italic>halachah</italic> also applies to regular matzos and certainly to <italic>matzo shel mitzvah</italic>. The one who draws the water should say: &#x201C;This is being done for <italic>matzah shel mitzvah</italic>.&#x201D; (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 455:21&#x2013;23)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn367">4. The flour may be kneaded, however, even initially in a copper vessel. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 455:25)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn368">5. According to some later <italic>Poskim</italic> (<italic>Tshubiner Rav</italic>) you may not add water if it contains chlorine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn369">6. According to <italic>Ramah</italic>, (<italic>Yoreh Deiah</italic> 116) water should not be drawn at the time of the vernal equinox. Many of the later <italic>Poskim</italic> maintain that in our times, we are lenient in these matters.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 110 Laws Concerning the Kneading and Baking of the Matzos</title>
<p>1) If you want to bake matzos in an oven in which <italic>chametz</italic> has been baked, it must be <italic>kashered</italic> by heating it until it becomes red hot, that is, heating it to such a degree that sparks fly from it, for anything less than that does not constitute true glowing. You should be careful to spread the coal over the entire area of the oven. The correct thing to do is to remove the ashes and clean it thoroughly after heating, and wait until it cools off somewhat; and then make a new fire for baking the matzos. This should not be done immediately after the heating process.</p>
<p>2) Some people have the custom to plaster the oven with fresh clay to avoid the necessity of <italic>kashering</italic> it through heating, for the <italic>chametz</italic> absorbed in the roof and walls of the oven is emitted by the heat of the flame that is lit for the purpose of baking the matzos. It is a good custom, provided the oven is plastered with a coating of clay, the thickness of a finger or more, over its entire area. But a thin coating is of no use.</p>
<p>3) Matzos should be kneaded and prepared only in a house that has a roof, and not before an open window, even if the sun does not shine through it. But if the windows are closed and have panes, it is permitted to knead the matzos, if the sun does not shine through them. But if the sun shines through them, the glass panes are of no use, but a curtain must be spread over the windows on the sunny side of the room. Care must be taken that the house should not be heated and warm.</p>
<p>4) No dough should be kneaded that is larger than the quantity of dough that is subject to the separation of <italic>challah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn370">1</xref></sup> It is better to make it smaller, for our Rabbis of blessed memory estimated, that if the dough is larger than the quantity of dough that is subject to <italic>challah</italic>, it cannot be worked at one and the same time;<sup><xref rid="fn371">2</xref></sup> thus part of it will be left unworked, and there is reason to fear that it may become <italic>chametz</italic>. If the dough you are kneading is loose, flour should not be added to thicken it.</p>
<p>5) When the flour is measured, it should not be stuffed into the measuring vessel because there is reason to fear that the dough might not be kneaded well, and particles of flour will be found in the matzah, and when put into the soup, it will become <italic>chametz</italic>. Care should be taken not to put the flour near the water, so that flour dust should not fall into the water. Similarly, the person who measures the flour should not go near the dough or the water. It is good to be careful not to handle the flour needlessly, because the hands will warm it slightly.</p>
<p>6) It should be watched that the vessel used for kneading should not have any holes or cracks where particles of dough might remain and become <italic>chametz</italic>. While kneading, the vessel should not be placed on pillows or pads, lest it become warm. Care must be taken that every eighteen minutes the vessel is thoroughly cleaned, and the hands thoroughly washed. The boards and rolling pins must be carefully inspected to make sure that they have no holes or cracks. They should be thoroughly cleaned at least every eighteen minutes. The tools that make the perforations must also be cleaned of even the smallest particle of dough. The peel (a shovel-like tool), with which the matzos are put into the oven, must be carefully inspected for any cracks<sup><xref rid="fn372">3</xref></sup> where a particle of dough might be caught and become <italic>chametz</italic>.</p>
<p>7) If anything with a sharp flavor fell into the dough, such as salt, spices or even if the smallest quantity fresh lime and was kneaded into it, the use of the entire dough is forbidden, because it has become heated by it. If a grain of wheat is found in the dough, you should remove from it a quantity of dough as thick as your finger, all around that grain, and throw it away; and the rest of the dough may be used.</p>
<p>8) Care must be taken not to leave the dough, even for a moment without working it. As soon as the dough is completed, it should be divided into portions and handed to the rollers. Care should be taken, therefore, to make the dough only as large as can be handled by the rollers. If some of the dough is left with the person who hands out the portions, he should keep kneading it so that it should not lie idle even for a moment.</p>
<p>9) The rollers should do their work at full speed and not waste time on giving the matzos a specific shape. They should pay close attention that no particles of the dough are left on the board, and also that no dough clings to their hands. As soon as they notice any dough sticking to their hands, they must wash them thoroughly.<sup><xref rid="fn373">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>10) As soon as the matzah is ready, it should be perforated quickly. They should not make any design with the perforations, but they should rush at top speed, and put it into the oven immediately. Great care should be taken not to hold it even for a moment in front of the opening of the oven, for it will become <italic>chametz</italic> quickly. It is necessary, therefore, to make sure that the person handing the matzos to the baker should be a Torah scholar, a God-fearing man, who will be meticulously vigilant.</p>
<p>11) A God-fearing person should take care, before baking his matzos, to have the oven well heated again, and the coals spread over the entire oven, for who knows if the person who baked matzos before him was scrupulously careful about it.</p>
<p>12) The baker should be very careful to see to it that none of the matzos are folded over, and that one matzah does not touch the other, for in the place where one matzah touches another or where it is folded over it does not bake quickly and it becomes <italic>chametz</italic>. In the event that a matzah is folded over or becomes blown up, it is necessary to break off and throw away that piece; that piece is <italic>chametz</italic>, but the rest may be eaten. However, if the matzos touched each other in the oven while still moist, they may be eaten, since it is already done. A blown up matzah is one in which it is evident that the matzah has separated in its thickness, and the bubble is as wide as a thumb.</p>
<p>13) Care should be taken not to take a matzah out of the oven before it is slightly baked; that is, if you would break it, there should be no threads of dough [between the pieces.] Before this stage it is still like dough, which when taken out of the oven will become <italic>chametz</italic> very quickly. The peel with which this matzah was taken out of the oven is forbidden to be used for baking matzos. If it is impossible to determine whether or not this matzah, had threads of dough when taken out of the oven, because of the uncertainty, we are strict. But if the matzah has formed a crust, we may take a lenient view.</p>
<p>14) Every God-fearing man should personally supervise the preparation and baking of his own matzos, and urge the workers, to work with speed and care. This was how it was done by the early, great Sages of Yisrael of blessed memory, and this is what is done also at the present time.</p>
<p>15) The matzos with which we fulfill the mitzvah of eating matzah on the first two nights of Pesach are referred to as <italic>matzos mitzvah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn374">5</xref></sup> and they must be prepared for the sake of the mitzvah by an adult, male Jew of intelligence,<sup><xref rid="fn375">6</xref></sup> aged at least thirteen years and one day, or a female aged at least twelve years and one day. At each stage in the preparation the worker says, <italic>leshem matzas mitzvah</italic>, [&#x201C;For the sake of the matzah of the mitzvah.&#x201D;] (This should be said) even when drawing the water. (All the foregoing laws regarding the baking of the matzos refer to our custom that all matzos are baked before Pesach. In an emergency, when matzos are baked on Pesach, there are other stringencies in addition to the ones mentioned above. Those who follow the custom of baking <italic>matzos mitzvah</italic> in the afternoon of <italic>erev Pesach</italic> must take special precautions).</p>
<ftnote id="fn370">1. A quantity of flour that equals forty-three and one-fifth eggs is subject to the law of <italic>challah</italic>. (see Chapter 35:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn371">2. There are some <italic>Poskim</italic> that are lenient and permit even larger quantities, since in our times there are large ovens and many people are involved in production which makes it unlikely that it will become <italic>chametz</italic>. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> says, however, that it is best to be stringent, even in these times and to follow the opinions of the <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic>. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 456:7, <italic>Shaarei Tzion</italic> 10)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn372">3. The proper custom is to appoint a supervisor (<italic>Mashgiach</italic>) in the matzah bakery to oversee the entire process. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 459:33)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn373">4. They should also wash their hands every eighteen minutes. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 459:33)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn374">5. According to <italic>Rambam</italic>, all the precautions that must be taken for <italic>matzos mitzvah</italic> must be taken for all the matzos that are eaten on Pesach. <italic>Magid Mishnah</italic> maintains that <italic>Rambam&#x2019;s</italic> ruling was only said on an initial stringency, and only regarding violations of these precautions disqualifying the matzos. <italic>Chayei Adam</italic> writes that the <italic>Vilna Gaon</italic> insisted that all matzos eaten on Pesach be made with these precautions. (see <italic>Biyur Halachah</italic> 460:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn375">6. There is a dispute among the <italic>Poskim</italic> regarding grinding the wheat. Some maintain that the grinding, too, must be done by Jews, but the custom today is to be lenient and permit it even when done by a non-Jew, so long as a Jew is present to watch that it does not become <italic>chametz</italic>. Nevertheless, where possible, the grinding should be done by a Jew and it is considered a praiseworthy deed when done so. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 460:1)</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 111 The Search and Nullification of the Chametz</title>
<p>1) On the evening before <italic>erev Pesach</italic> the search for <italic>chametz</italic> must be made. You must make the search immediately after nightfall.<sup><xref rid="fn376">1</xref></sup> It is forbidden to begin a meal<sup><xref rid="fn377">2</xref></sup> or do any work one half-hour before nightfall.<sup><xref rid="fn378">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) The search should be made with only one wax candle, not with several candles intertwined, for that would be like a torch.<sup><xref rid="fn379">4</xref></sup> In a predicament when you have no wax candle, you may use a tallow candle.</p>
<p>3 )You must search all rooms in which you suspect that someone carried <italic>chametz</italic>, even cellars, attics, stores and woodsheds; any places in which you think that <italic>chametz</italic> may have been brought must be searched. You must also search all vessels in which you keep <italic>chametz</italic>. Before making the search, you should carefully sweep all these places and clean all <italic>chametz</italic> out of them, in order to make it easy for you to search the rooms afterwards.</p>
<p>4) A cowshed where the cattle are fed grain, and a chicken coop where the chickens are fed with grain do not require searching; [first of all,] because the grain may never have become <italic>chametz</italic>, and even if it did become <italic>chametz</italic>, it is possible that all of it was eaten and nothing was left. But if the grain you put there was <italic>chametz</italic>, you then have only one uncertainty, whether all of it was eaten; we do not rely on this possibility, and you are required to make a search.</p>
<p>5) You must search everywhere, every nook and cranny, as best as you can. You must also search the pockets of your garments and those of your children&#x2019;s garments; for since sometimes <italic>chametz</italic> gets into them,<sup><xref rid="fn380">5</xref></sup> they have to be searched. You should shake them thoroughly the next morning when you burn the <italic>chametz</italic>.</p>
<p>6) [This is the law concerning] the rooms you sell to a non-Jew together with the <italic>chametz</italic> in them. Since the sale is not valid until the morning, you are obliged to search them in the evening,<sup><xref rid="fn381">6</xref></sup> and you must do so.</p>
<p>7) Before beginning the search you recite the berachah: <italic>Baruch ata Hashem, Elokeinu melech haolam asher kideshanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu al biur chameitz</italic> &#x201C;Blessed are you, Hashem, our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and has commanded us concerning the removal of <italic>chametz</italic>.&#x201D; Even though you do not yet remove it, you still say the berachah &#x201C;concerning the removal,&#x201D; since immediately after the search, you nullify the <italic>chametz</italic> that is unknown to you, and this, in effect, is the removal of such <italic>chametz</italic>. Do not make any interruption between the berachah and beginning the search.<sup><xref rid="fn382">7</xref></sup> It is a good thing not to interrupt until the search is completed, except for things relating to the search.<sup><xref rid="fn383">8</xref></sup> You may search many houses on the basis of the one berachah you recited.</p>
<p>8) Some people have the custom, before beginning the search, to deposit small pieces of bread in places where the searcher will find them. They are fearful, if he finds no <italic>chametz</italic>, the berachah will have been said in vain.<sup><xref rid="fn384">9</xref></sup> Needless to say, however, anyone who does not search properly, but only gathers up these pieces of bread, has not fulfilled the mitzvah of searching, and his berachah was said in vain.</p>
<p>9) The <italic>chametz</italic> you leave for food or for sale, should be put away in a safe place, before making the search. The <italic>chametz</italic> you find in the search, which must be burned in the morning, should be put away in a safe place and tied so that it won&#x2019;t get lost. It should be put it in a place where you will notice it in the morning, so that you will not forget to burn it.</p>
<p>10) Immediately after the search, you should nullify the <italic>chametz</italic>. The actual nullification takes place in your heart, when you decide in your heart that you consider all <italic>chametz</italic> in your possession as non-existent, as worthless, as compared to dust, as something utterly useless. Our sages ordained that you should express these thoughts verbally by declaring <italic>kol chamira</italic> (all <italic>chametz</italic>) etc. Anyone who does not understand it in the Aramaic, should say it in a language he understands.<sup><xref rid="fn385">10</xref></sup> [The English translation of the Aramaic text is]: &#x201C;Any leaven or <italic>chametz</italic> that is in my possession, that I have not seen and have not removed, should be nullified and become ownerless, like the dust of the earth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>11) Even though you have already nullified the <italic>chametz</italic> at night after the search, nevertheless, in the morning after burning it, you must nullify it again. In this declaration you include all the <italic>chametz</italic>, and you say, <italic>Kol chamira</italic>&#x2014;(all <italic>chametz</italic>) etc., or in a language you understand. [The English translation of the Aramaic text is:] Any leaven or <italic>chametz</italic> that is in my possession whether I have seen it or not, whether I have removed it or not, should be nullified and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>12) If you have a room that must be searched, that you want to use as a storage room; that is to say, you want to store, fruit, wood or other articles, which would make it impossible to search the room on the night of the fourteenth of Nisan, then you should search that room before<sup><xref rid="fn386">11</xref></sup> you convert it to a storeroom, making the search at night,<sup><xref rid="fn387">12</xref></sup> in the same manner as you search for <italic>chametz</italic> on the night of the fourteenth of Nisan.<sup><xref rid="fn388">13</xref></sup> [This holds true] even if there is still plenty of time before Pesach, and even if this is immediately after the <italic>Pesach</italic> that has just passed. However, if you did not search the room before turning it into a storage room, if you intend to remove the stored articles, before the time of the search will come, you do not have to go to the trouble at this time to empty the room and search it. But if you intend to remove the articles during the week of <italic>Pesach</italic>, you must remove them now and make the search, even though it involves great trouble and loss of money.</p>
<p>13) If you fill up a storage room with the intention of not emptying it until after <italic>Pesach</italic>, then it depends on the time you fill it up. If you do it more than thirty days before <italic>Pesach</italic>, you need not search the room. However if there is any <italic>chametz</italic> you know of, you must first remove it. The declaration of nullification will then effectively nullify all your <italic>chametz</italic> at the proper time (<italic>erev Pesach</italic>). However, if it is within thirty days before <italic>Pesach</italic>, you are subject to the laws of searching for <italic>chametz</italic> (because we ask questions and explain the laws of <italic>Pesach</italic> thirty days before <italic>Pesach</italic>), thus you must search the room. Even if, inadvertently, you forgot to make the search, you must empty the storeroom, and make the search in the night, immediately after you become aware of your oversight.</p>
<p>14) If you store wheat that has not become <italic>chametz</italic>, in a pit, but afterwards, because of the dampness of the pit, the wheat at the bottom of the pit and at the sides became <italic>chametz</italic>; then, even if it was stored there within thirty days, you need not empty the pit on the night of the fourteenth and search it, rather reciting the nullification is enough, since it was stored in a permissible manner. If some of the wheat was <italic>chametz</italic> (when stored); there are many differing opinions about this, and in such case you should consult a qualified <italic>posek</italic>.</p>
<p>15) You should not throw grain to the chickens in a moist place during the thirty days before <italic>Pesach</italic>, for you may forget to burn it.</p>
<p>16) Before starting on a trip,<sup><xref rid="fn389">14</xref></sup> you should appoint an agent to search and nullify your <italic>chametz</italic>. You should tell him explicitly, that you appoint him as your agent to make the search and the nullification. When making the nullification the agent says, &#x201C;The <italic>chametz</italic> of so-and-so etc.&#x201D; Nevertheless, wherever you happen to be on the morning of <italic>erev Pesach</italic>, you should nullify the <italic>chametz</italic> on your premises.</p>
<p>17) If you find <italic>chametz</italic> in your house on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>, you should take it out and burn it, and if it is the quantity of a <italic>kazayis</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn390">15</xref></sup> you should first say the berachah: <italic>Al biur chametz</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn391">16</xref></sup> but if it is less than a <italic>kazayis</italic>, you do not say a berachah. If you find the <italic>chametz</italic> on Yom Tov or on the Shabbos of <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>, or on the Shabbos which occurs on <italic>erev Pesach</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn392">17</xref></sup> when it is forbidden to handle the <italic>chametz</italic> because it is <italic>muktzeh</italic>, you should cover it with a vessel until the conclusion of Yom Tov, or the conclusion of Shabbos, and then you should burn it. If you find <italic>chametz</italic> on the last two days of <italic>Pesach</italic>, in which case at the conclusion of Yom Tov, <italic>Pesach</italic> has already ended, you do not say the berachah when burning it. You should burn it without saying the berachah, even though its quantity is as much as a <italic>kazayis</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn376">1. I.e. immediately after the appearance of the stars. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 431:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn377">2. A small snack is permitted. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 431:6)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn378">3. Even if you began the meal earlier than one half hour, you must interrupt the meal when the time for searching begins. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 431:11, 12)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn379">4. If you used a torch or even a candle with several wicks, the search is invalid and you must repeat it with a single candle. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 433:10)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn380">5. Even if you say you are certain that you did not put any <italic>chametz</italic> in your pockets, you are, nevertheless, required to search them, because often people place things in their pockets and forget they did so. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 433:47)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn381">6. This is also the opinion of <italic>Mekor Chaim</italic> and <italic>Chayei Adam</italic>. In their responsa, <italic>Binyan Olam</italic> and <italic>Chasam Sofer</italic> disagree and rule that you may be lenient so long as you searched the other rooms. This is also the opinion of <italic>Aishel Avrohom</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 436:32, 433:23)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn382">7. If you did interrupt with something unrelated to the search, you must repeat the berachah, since there was an interruption between the berachah and the mitzvah. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 432:5)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn383">8. If you did interrupt, you need not repeat the berachah since you began the search, and thus there was no interruption between the berachah and the mitzvah. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 432:6)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn384">9. It is, however, not a &#x201C;blessing in vain&#x201D; because the mitzvah is specifically to search for <italic>chametz</italic> and even if no <italic>chametz</italic> is found, the mitzvah is fulfilled. Nevertheless, it is not proper to negate a custom of the Jewish people. According to the <italic>Arizal</italic>, it is customary to place ten pieces of bread around the house. Special care must be taken that none of these pieces of <italic>chametz</italic> go lost. It is best to use the sort of bread that will not create crumbs. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 432:12, 13)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn385">10. Someone who understands absolutely nothing of the text of this declaration and thinks he is merely reciting some sort of prayer, has not fulfilled his obligation. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 434:9)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn386">11. Regarding a person who embarks on a journey before the night of the fourteenth, who is required to search his home before leaving, <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> writes that he must also nullify the <italic>chametz</italic> that is not visible to him. (This may also apply in our case as well). (Ibid. 436:3)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn387">12. Regarding a person who embarks on a journey before the night of the fourteenth who is required to search his home before leaving, <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> writes that if he forgot to search at night, he should do so by day. (<italic>Ibid</italic>.)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn388">13. However, the berachah is not recited when the search is made before the night of the fourteenth. (See <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 436:4 and also <italic>Biyur Halachah</italic> who writes that there are opinions that a berachah is said when the search is made within thirty days of the fourteenth).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn389">14. According to <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> (436:9) this refers to one who is going on a long trip or a sea journey. Even though he plans to return in ample time before <italic>Pesach</italic>, we are concerned that he might be delayed. One who leaves on a short trip and plans to return before the night of the fourteenth, need not take these measures. If, however, he plans to return within a short time before the search must begin, we are concerned that he may be delayed and, therefore, he should take the steps outlined in this paragraph.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn390">15. See glossary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn391">16. If, however, you searched your house properly and nullified all <italic>chametz</italic> before Pesach, and then found <italic>chametz</italic> on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>, according to some later <italic>Poskim</italic>, the original berachah you made before <italic>Pesach</italic> suffices even for the <italic>chametz</italic> you found on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>. Other <italic>Poskim</italic> maintain that a new berachah should be recited. Since there is a question, the rule of &#x201C;doubtful <italic>berachos</italic>&#x201D; applies and the berachah should not be recited. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 435:5)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 112 Chametz That is Forbidden to be Kept on Pesach and That Which May be Kept on Pesach</title>
<p>1) Any food that contains a mixture of <italic>chametz</italic> even if the <italic>chametz</italic> is not actually present, but only the taste of the <italic>chametz</italic> remained after the <italic>chametz</italic> itself was removed, is forbidden to be kept during <italic>Pesach</italic>. However, if the food never contained <italic>chametz</italic> but was cooked in a vessel used for <italic>chametz</italic>, even if <italic>chametz</italic> was cooked in the vessel that day, or if an item was pickled in a vessel used for <italic>chametz</italic>, you are permitted to keep it during <italic>Pesach</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn393">1</xref></sup> provided it was cooked or pickled before <italic>Pesach;</italic> but if the cooking or pickling was done on <italic>Pesach</italic> in a vessel used for <italic>chametz</italic>, the food item must be burned.</p>
<p>2) If grain contains some seeds that have sprouted or were split open, even if only a few of them were mixed in a large quantity, or if water has fallen on the grain, or it was washed with water, it is forbidden to keep (such grain during <italic>Pesach</italic>), and anything that was prepared from such grain, is forbidden to be kept during <italic>Pesach</italic>. If you sell your neighbor grain that has become wet, you must let him know this, so that he will not keep it in his possession during <italic>Pesach</italic>. You are forbidden to sell it to a non-Jew, when you are concerned that the non-Jew will sell it to a Jew who will keep it during <italic>Pesach</italic>.</p>
<p>3) Clothes that were laundered and starched with wheat starch are permitted to be worn on <italic>Pesach</italic>, but you should not spread a tablecloth if there is any starch on it, for there is concern that some particles may flake off, and most certainly it is forbidden to put the <italic>Pesach</italic> flour into such a cloth.</p>
<p>4) You are allowed to paste paper on a window even during the thirty days before <italic>Pesach</italic>, provided the <italic>chametz</italic> is not visible. Since the paste is not absolute <italic>chametz</italic>, and it is also covered up, the Sages did not rule stringently in this case. But, if the paste is visible, it is forbidden. But before the thirty days, it is permitted in any case.</p>
<p>5) If ink was prepared with beer before <italic>Pesach</italic>, you are permitted to write with it on <italic>Chol Hamoed Pesach</italic>, because it has become unfit even for dog food before <italic>Pesach</italic>. The same law applies to all similar cases where <italic>chametz</italic> has become spoiled and totally unfit before <italic>Pesach</italic>. You may derive benefit from such <italic>chametz</italic> and keep it on <italic>Pesach</italic>. But if a non-Jew prepared ink with beer on <italic>Pesach</italic>, a Jew is forbidden to derive benefit from it, because the <italic>chametz</italic> belonging to a non-Jew is also forbidden for a Jew to benefit from on <italic>Pesach</italic>.</p>
<p>6) All vessels that you are not kashering for <italic>Pesach</italic> must be scrubbed thoroughly on <italic>erev Pesach</italic> before the sixth hour, and rinsed in such a way that no <italic>chametz</italic> is visible on them. They should be stored in a secluded place where you do not ordinarily go on <italic>Pesach</italic>. It is best to lock them up in a separate room and to hide the key until after <italic>Pesach</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn393">1. This is permitted only if it is removed from the <italic>chametz</italic> vessel and put into a <italic>Pesach</italic> vessel. You should take care to put the food in a place where you or others do not usually go, in order to prevent anyone from eating the food on <italic>Pesach</italic>. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 442:1)</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 113 Laws Concerning Erev Pesach and the Baking of Matzos</title>
<p>1) On <italic>erev Pesach</italic> we do not say <italic>Mizmor lesodah</italic>&#x2014;&#x201C;A psalm of thanksgiving&#x201D; (Psalm 100), neither do we say <italic>Lamenatzei&#x2019;ach</italic>&#x2014;&#x201C;For the Conductor&#x201D; (Psalm 20).</p>
<p>2) You are permitted to eat <italic>chametz</italic> only during the first third of the day, (the day is calculated as extending from dawn until the stars appear). But you may derive benefit from it for another hour. Thus, you are permitted to sell it to a non-Jew<sup><xref rid="fn394">1</xref></sup> during that hour, but after that time it is forbidden to derive any benefit from it. You must burn the <italic>chametz</italic> and nullify it while you are still permitted to derive benefit from it.</p>
<p>3) After midday it is forbidden to do any work.<sup><xref rid="fn395">2</xref></sup> However, you are permitted to do such work as is permitted on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>. But it is customary to permit a non-Jew [to do work for you.] In some communities it is the custom to forbid doing work the entire day.</p>
<p>4) You should take a haircut and cut your nails before midday.<sup><xref rid="fn396">3</xref></sup> If you forget to do so, you may cut your nails in the afternoon, but it is forbidden to take a haircut, unless it is done by a non-Jew.</p>
<p>5) It is forbidden to eat matzah the entire day.<sup><xref rid="fn397">4</xref></sup> It is forbidden to give matzah even to small children once they are able to understand the meaning of the Exodus. However, everyone is permitted to eat<sup><xref rid="fn398">5</xref></sup> food made of matzah meal, until the beginning of the tenth hour, that is until the beginning of the final quarter of the day. From that time on it is forbidden to eat, except when it is necessary, in which case you may eat some fruit, or a little meat and fish You should be careful not to overeat, so that you will eat the matzah in the evening with appetite.</p>
<p>6) The firstborn sons either of the father or of the mother must fast on <italic>erev Pesach</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn399">6</xref></sup> even if it occurs on Friday. A firstborn who was born after a miscarriage must also fast. When the firstborn is a minor, his father fasts instead of him. Whether firstborn are permitted to eat at a mitzvah meal depends on the local custom.<sup><xref rid="fn400">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>7) A firstborn who fasts should say <italic>Aneinu</italic> in the <italic>Shemoneh esre</italic> of <italic>Minchah</italic>. If there are many firstborn and they pray with the congregation, none of the firstborn should be the Chazzan, since <italic>Aneinu</italic> should not be said loud during the repetition of the <italic>Shemoneh esre</italic>, since it is the month of Nisan.</p>
<p>8) People who do the mitzvah meticulously bake the mitzvah-matzos in the afternoon of <italic>erev Pesach</italic>, which is the time when the Paschal lamb was offered. And because at that time <italic>chametz</italic> is forbidden, it is best to nullify the crumbs explicitly, by making the following statement: &#x201C;All the crumbs that will fall off during the kneading and preparing, as well as the dough that will cling to the vessels, I hereby nullify and render ownerless.&#x201D;</p>
<p>9) The water with which the vessels are washed should be poured on a sloping place where there is no stone floor, so that it will be quickly absorbed in the ground; for by pouring it on level ground, or even in a sloping place with a stone floor, there is reason to be concerned that the water will gather in one place and become <italic>chametz</italic> before it is absorbed in the ground; thus there will be <italic>chametz</italic> in your possession.</p>
<ftnote id="fn394">1. In cases where large financial losses may occur, it is permitted to sell the <italic>chametz</italic> up to an hour (60 minutes) before midday. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 443:9)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn395">2. A worker who will not have food to eat unless he works is permitted to work even after midday. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 468:46)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn396">3. All those who are permitted to take a haircut and to wash clothing on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>, are also permitted to do so on <italic>erev Pesach</italic> after midday. (See Chapter 104:11) (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 468:7)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn397">4. Some have the custom not to eat matzo from <italic>Rosh Chodesh Nissan</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 471:12)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn398">5. Cakes made with matzah meal are forbidden, but knodel made with matzah meal is permitted. See <italic>Ramah</italic> 671. The difference between cake and knodel is that cake is baked whereas knodel is cooked, and in cooking the taste of matzah is not as strong.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn399">6. However, if you had a severe headache or your eyes hurt you, you need not complete the fast. Similarly, if fasting affects you so that after the fast you are unable to eat, except light foods, and it is possible you will be unable to eat matzah, marror and drink four cups of wine at night, it is better not to fast. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 470:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn400">7. Our custom is to permit the first born to eat at a <italic>Siyum</italic> (the completion) of a <italic>Maseches</italic>, even though they, themselves, did not study it. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 470:10)</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 114 The Laws Concerning the Selling of Chametz</title>
<p>1) A Jew who has <italic>chametz</italic> in his possession on <italic>Pesach</italic>, continually transgresses the law, &#x201C;No <italic>chametz</italic> must be seen in your possession&#x201D; (Ex. 13:7) and &#x201C;No <italic>chametz</italic> may be found in your home&#x201D; (Ex. 12:19). Benefit of such <italic>chametz</italic> is forever forbidden, even if he nullified it before <italic>Pesach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn401">1</xref></sup> Therefore, if you own a great deal of <italic>chametz</italic> that you cannot do away with, you must sell it to a non-Jew before <italic>Pesach</italic>, while you are still permitted to derive benefit from it. You should not treat the matter of selling <italic>chametz</italic> as a routine formality. Rather, it should be your firm intention to actually sell the <italic>chametz</italic> to the non-Jew, in a firm and binding sale. You should not sell it for more than it is worth. After <italic>Pesach</italic> you demand from the non-Jew that he pay his debt, and when he replies that he has no money, you ask of him to resell the <italic>chametz</italic> to you (together with the room) for so-and-so-much. You should not make a mockery out of this matter, rather, it should be handled in a business-like manner.</p>
<p>2) The <italic>chametz</italic> sold to the non-Jew, may not remain in the house of the Jew. If the non-Jew takes the <italic>chametz</italic> into his own house, so much the better. But if he cannot take it to his home, then you must rent to him the room in which the <italic>chametz</italic> is (stored). You must mention in the bill of sale the name of the buyer and the amount for which the room was rented, and that by means of the rental of the room, you are transferring to him the ownership of the <italic>chametz</italic> that is contained in it.<sup><xref rid="fn402">2</xref></sup> You should list all the <italic>chametz</italic>, stating the price of each item,<sup><xref rid="fn403">3</xref></sup> but you need not mention their weights and measures. You may simply write how much you charge per measure. All that is written in the contract should be discussed orally with the buyer. You should take a deposit from him, and the balance of the purchase price should be considered as a loan. All of the above should be written in the contract. You must also deliver to the buyer the key to the room.<sup><xref rid="fn404">4</xref></sup> If any <italic>chametz</italic> is in a vessel that requires <italic>tevilah</italic> (ritual immersion) when bought from a non-Jew, you should not sell it with the vessel, because (if you do sell it), then, after <italic>Pesach</italic>, when you buy it back from the non-Jew, you will have to immerse it again.</p>
<p>3) If, after you sold the <italic>chametz</italic>, you are afraid that the buyer may damage it, you are permitted to put an additional lock on the door to protect it;<sup><xref rid="fn405">5</xref></sup> or, if the buyer wants to deposit the key with the Jew, he may do so. But it is forbidden for a Jew to put a seal on the <italic>chametz</italic>.</p>
<p>4) If you are unable to rent the whole room because you need part of it for your own use, you should make a partition<sup><xref rid="fn406">6</xref></sup> in front of the place where the <italic>chametz</italic> is kept, and rent to the non-Jew the space (where the <italic>chametz</italic> is kept) up to the partition, and write this in the contract. You should also state that the buyer has the right of access to enter this place at will. You should also stipulate, that if this non-Jew, the buyer, wishes to sell the <italic>chametz</italic> to another non-Jew during <italic>Pesach</italic>, or to a Jew, the day after <italic>Pesach</italic>, all of these have the right to access there. If a Jew rents or sells to a non-Jew a room that is accessible only through the premises of the seller, it must be written in the contract that the non-Jew, the buyer, and any other buyers that he may bring there, should have the right to enter there.</p>
<p>5) If the house you live in was rented from another Jew, you cannot rent it to the non-Jew as a residence without the permission of the landlord. Therefore, you should expressly tell the non-Jew that you are not renting it to him as a residence, but only to keep his vessels and belongings there. You should not rent it with the stipulation that you are doing so to keep the <italic>chametz</italic> there, but generally to keep his vessels and belongings as he sees fit. Nevertheless, if the landlord is in town, you should obtain his permission to rent it. If you go on a trip before <italic>Pesach</italic>, and your wife is going to sell the <italic>chametz</italic>, you should give her express permission to rent the room.</p>
<p>6) It is forbidden to stipulate with the non-Jew that after <italic>Pesach</italic>, he must sell the <italic>chametz</italic> back to you, or that you, are obligated to buy it back from him, but you are permitted to assure him that you will buy it back from him, and give him some profit.</p>
<p>7) It is forbidden to sell the <italic>chametz</italic> to an apostate Jewish man or woman, or to the son of an apostate woman, even if she gave birth to him from a non-Jew after she became an apostate; for regarding this matter, they are Jews in the eyes of halachah, and the <italic>chametz</italic> will be considered as chametz that was in the possession of a Jew during <italic>Pesach</italic>, the benefit of which is forbidden forever.</p>
<p>8) If you own <italic>chametz</italic> in another place, or en route in wagons or on ships, you can also sell it [to a non-Jew] by means of selling him a place in your town.<sup><xref rid="fn407">7</xref></sup> Nevertheless, you should also renounce your ownership to it before a Rabbinic Court or before three laymen. If the <italic>chametz</italic> is delivered to you on <italic>Pesach</italic>, the non-Jewish buyer should pay the cost of the wagon and the other expenses. If <italic>chametz</italic> is delivered to you, which was shipped by a non-Jew, and you had not ordered it, and knew nothing about it, the non-Jew should also receive it and pay whatever is due to the one who brought it. You should have nothing at all to do with it; on the contrary, you should renounce ownership to it before a Rabbinical Court or before three laymen.</p>
<p>9) A person owning a mill, whose customers, grind their grain, and pay their fee in grain, which is <italic>chametz</italic>, must either sell or lease the mill, to a non-Jew, before <italic>Pesach</italic>.</p>
<p>10) Regarding the sale of cattle to a non-Jew, who will feed them <italic>chametz</italic>, there are differing opinions among the Sages of blessed memory. If possible, it is best to avoid selling them, but if it is impossible, it should be done with advice of a qualified <italic>Posek</italic>.</p>
<p>11) You are permitted to lend a loaf of bread to another Jew before <italic>Pesach</italic>, with the understanding that he should return (a loaf of bread) after <italic>Pesach</italic>. In some communities, it is the custom to forbid such loans.</p>
<p>12) If the <italic>chametz</italic> of a Jew is in the possession of a non-Jew, or conversely, the <italic>chametz</italic> of a non-Jew is in the possession of a Jew, you should consult (a qualified <italic>Posek)</italic> how to act in this matter, for there are many differing opinions regarding it.</p>
<p>13) You should be careful, not to benefit after Pesach of the <italic>chametz</italic> of a Jew, who is suspected of not having sold it properly.</p>
<title><italic>Form of Contract for the Sale of Chametz</italic></title>
<p align="blockquote">I, the undersigned, have sold hereby to the non-Jew (so-and-so) all the whiskey that I have in the cellar of my residence. The cellar is on the north side of the courtyard, another cellar is situated on the east side. All the whiskey that I have there, whether in medium-size barrels, or in large ones, I have sold to the above-mentioned party, together with the vessels for one hundred and twenty dollars. Also the arak-brandy that I have there, in a big bottle, about seven measures in size, I sold to him for five dollars, without the bottle. Also, the slivovitz, that I have there in a small barrel, I sold him for twelve dollars and fifty cents, together with the vessel. I also sold him six empty barrels, that once contained whiskey, and two large barrels with iron hoops, that once contained whiskey. I sold all of these for eight dollars and fifty cents. Also, five bags of wheat flour, that I have in a room called storage room, which is part of my residence, I sold to the above-mentioned party, together with the bags, for thirty-nine dollars, as well as all chametz vessels that I have there, such as kneading troughs and flour boxes, which I sold to him for four dollars and fifty cents. Also, barley, in a small bag that I have there, I sold to him for one dollar and fifty cents, together with the bag. I received a deposit from him of ten dollars; the balance I charge him as a loan. The time for payment to be no later than ten days from the date mentioned below. I rented to the said buyer, the above-mentioned cellar and the above-mentioned room, from now until the end of ten days, from the day mentioned below, for the amount of four dollars. I received a deposit of three dollars. The balance I charged as a loan, to be paid to me, no later than ten days from the date mentioned below. By means of the real estate rented to him, that is, the cellar and the room mentioned above, I conferred ownership to him of all the goods mentioned above. I hereby declare, truthfully, that I leased to him the cellar and the room mentioned above, and I conferred ownership to him of all goods mentioned above, by any and all means of acquisition that may be effective, whichever it may be; that the acquisition be binding, according to the laws of our holy Torah, and according to the civil law, without any claim or counterclaim. He has the right to do with all the above-mentioned, as he sees fit, to sell it or to give it as a gift, or to rent it, without any interference. He also has the right to move all the above-mentioned into his house; and even if he leaves them where they are at present, he assumes the responsibility for everything as of now, and I assume no responsibility whatsoever, not even the responsibility for accidental loss. I have given the buyer the right of access, to go through my courtryard and my house, to the above-mentioned cellar and room, that are leased to him. Also, if he wishes, during the term of the lease, to sell some of the goods to someone else, to all those who come with his consent, likewise have the right of access. I also surrendered to him the keys to the above-mentioned cellar and room. This was executed in the most expedient manner, according to the law of our holy Torah, and in accordance to the law of the land.</p>

<ftnote id="fn401">1. Many later <italic>Poskim</italic> rule that this law applies, even if you made the search for <italic>chametz</italic> and also nullified the <italic>chametz</italic>, but others are lenient and rule that if you both searched for and nullified the <italic>chametz</italic>, it is not forbidden for benefit, since you fulfilled all that was required of you. Therefore, in a situation where there is a potential for great losses, this lenient opinion may be relied on. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 448:25; also <italic>Biyur Halachah</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn402">2. Most later <italic>Poskim</italic> rule that ownership of <italic>chametz</italic> in the room can also be transferred to the non-Jew, by means of the rental or sale of the room. This particular form of <italic>kinyan</italic> (ownership transferred), called <italic>kinyan agav</italic>, is considered, by many <italic>Poskim</italic>, the best form of <italic>kinyan</italic>, and it does not require that the articles, which are sold, actually be in the room. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 448:17,19)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn403">3. According to <italic>Choshen Mishpat</italic> 200:7, it is not necessary to list or state the price of each item. It is sufficient if the buyer agrees to rely on the evaluation of three people or even one person. This is the custom that is prevalent in our form of selling <italic>chametz</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn404">4. It is also acceptable, if you tell him that you will make the key available to him, whenever he desires to enter to take his <italic>chametz</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 448:12)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn405">5. But if you lock the room, at the time of sale, in order to prevent the non-Jew from taking the <italic>chametz</italic>, the <italic>chametz</italic> is forbidden after Pesach, as stated in Paragraph 1.

<title>Chapter 115 The Laws of Erev Pesach When it Occurs on Shabbos</title>
<p>1) If <italic>erev Pesach</italic> occurs on Shabbos, we make the search for <italic>chametz</italic> on the eve of the thirteenth of <italic>Nisan</italic>, that is, on Thursday night. After concluding the search, you nullify the <italic>chametz</italic> by saying <italic>Kol chamira</italic> etc., as in other years, and on Friday, you burn it, at the same time that you burn it every <italic>erev Pesach</italic>, but you do not say <italic>Kol chamira</italic>. On Shabbos, after the meal, you nullify it and say <italic>Kol Chamira</italic> etc.</p>
<p>2) The firstborn fast on Thursday; and if it is difficult for a firstborn to fast, until after the search for the <italic>chametz</italic>, he may have a small snack before making the search, or else, he may appoint someone as his agent to make the search (and eat a full meal).</p>
<p>3) For this Shabbos, you should not cook dishes made with flour and grits, because they may stick to the pots, and it is forbidden to clean them on Shabbos. Therefore, you should cook only dishes that will not stick (to the pot). After the meal, you should shake the tablecloth well, and hide it away, together with the vessels used for <italic>chametz</italic>, in a room, where you do not usually go on <italic>Pesach</italic>. If any bread is left over, you should give it to a non-Jew; but you should be careful not to violate the law against removing things from one domain to another (see Chapter 82, par. 9 above). The house should be swept, either by a non-Jew, or with a sweeper that may be used on Shabbos.</p>
<p>4) On Shabbos morning, the <italic>Shacharis</italic> service should be said at an early hour, so that there should be enough time to eat a meal with <italic>chametz</italic>, while it is still permissible to do so. It is proper to divide the meal into two parts, that is (after eating one course) recite <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>. Make a short pause by discussing Torah thoughts or taking a walk,<sup><xref rid="fn408">1</xref></sup> then wash your hands again, eat and say <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> again. Thereby, you will have fulfilled the mitzvah of eating three meals on Shabbos.</p>
<p>5) It is customary to read the <italic>Haftarah</italic> from Malachi 3:4, <italic>Ve&#x2019;arvah</italic> etc. because it is written there, &#x201C;Bring all the tithes into the storehouse etc.&#x201D; That is appropriate for the day, for (according to some authorities), the time at which all tithes had to be removed from the house was on <italic>erev Pesach</italic> of the fourth year of the <italic>Shemitah</italic> cycle, and on <italic>erev Pesach</italic> of the seventh year of the <italic>Shemitah</italic> cycle. All the tithes which were separated from your grain during the three years, and which were kept in your house, had to be given to the <italic>Levi</italic> at the above-mentioned times.</p>
<p>6) On this Friday, every man should be very careful to ask whether <italic>challah</italic> has been separated from the <italic>challah</italic> loaves that were baked in honor of Shabbos, for if <italic>challah</italic> has not been separated, and you become aware of that on Shabbos, there is a great deal of confusion as to what should be done; because it is forbidden to separate <italic>challah</italic> on Shabbos, and it is also forbidden to keep the <italic>challah</italic> loaves because of Pesach. The <italic>Magein Avraham</italic> contends that all the loaves must be given to a non-Jew as an outright gift, before the time that their benefit is forbidden. Other authorities disagree and offer different solutions, but they all involve serious problems. Therefore, you must be careful about this.</p>
<ftnote id="fn408">1. If there is not sufficient time to pause between them, the meal should not be divided, as this will cause you to recite unnecessary berachos. It is, therefore, better to fulfill the mitzvah of eating the third meal, by eating meat, fish or fruits. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 444:8).</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 116 Laws of Kashering</title>
<p>1) Vessels made from earthenware that were used for <italic>chametz</italic> cannot be <italic>kashered</italic> by immersion in boiling water, nor by heating with charcoal or blow torch. Ovens and stoves made of stone and bricks can be <italic>kashered</italic> by heating with charcoal (or a blow torch) (see above Chapter 110, par. 1 and 2). It is customary not to <italic>Kasher</italic> stoves used for heating the house during the winter. If you want to place any kind of a dish on the stove, during <italic>Pesach</italic>, you must first put a metal plate on the stove and then place the dish on it. This method may be used also with an oven made of tiles.</p>
<p>2) Vessels made of wood, metal, stoneware or bone, can be <italic>kashered</italic> by immersing them in boiling water. But vessels that will be damaged by boiling water, such as vessels that are glued together, even if only the handle is glued on, cannot be <italic>kashered</italic> by immersion in boiling water,<sup><xref rid="fn409">1</xref></sup> because we are concerned that they will not be <italic>kashered</italic> properly.</p>
<p>3) Before <italic>kashering</italic> a vessel, you must clean it thoroughly to remove any rust,<sup><xref rid="fn410">2</xref></sup> or similar residue, making it perfectly clean; but rust stains do not matter.<sup><xref rid="fn411">3</xref></sup> If the vessel has dents, they should be scraped carefully (with steel wool etc.). If it is made of metal, you should place hot charcoal on the dents (or use a blow torch) to &#x201C;glow&#x201D; them, and then <italic>kasher</italic> the vessel with boiling water. If it is impossible to thoroughly clean the dents and the cracks, and if it is also impossible to &#x201C;glow&#x201D; them, then the vessel cannot be <italic>kashered</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn412">4</xref></sup> Therefore, knives with handles must be carefully examined<sup><xref rid="fn413">5</xref></sup> to determine whether they can be <italic>kashered</italic>. The best way to do the mitzvah, if you can afford it, is to buy new knives for <italic>Pesach</italic>.</p>
<p>4) Vessels that are used over fire (or heat), without water, require glowing. Therefore, baking and frying pans, in which <italic>chametz</italic> was baked,<sup><xref rid="fn414">6</xref></sup> require glowing. Initially, the vessel must be heated so intensely, that it shoots off sparks. A wooden peel cannot be <italic>kashered</italic>.</p>
<p>5) If a vessel has a patch, and there is reason to suspect that underneath the patch, some <italic>chametz</italic> may have become trapped, that place must first be glowed until you are certain, that if there was a trace of <italic>chametz</italic>, it was burned; and then it should be <italic>kashered</italic> in boiling water. But if there is no reason to suspect that a trace of <italic>chametz</italic> was trapped there, then, if the patch was put on before the vessel was used for <italic>chametz</italic>, you may <italic>kasher</italic> it as is, because, just as the vessel absorbed the <italic>chametz</italic>, so it will expel it with the boiling water (used in the <italic>kashering</italic>)<italic></italic>. However, if the vessel was first used for <italic>chametz</italic>, and the patch was put on afterwards, then the <italic>kashering</italic> has no effect on the place underneath the patch, and in this case, too, before <italic>kashering</italic>, you must place hot charcoal on the patch, to glow that spot. If the patch was soldered with lead, silver, or similar solder, it may be <italic>kashered</italic> as is, since the <italic>chametz</italic> that has been absorbed, was burned by soldering.</p>
<p>6) A mortar, which is ordinarily used for pounding sharp tasting spices together with <italic>chametz</italic>, requires <italic>libun kal</italic> &#x2014;&#x201C;simple glowing&#x201D;, that is, it should be filled with burning charcoal, until it is hot enough to burn a piece of straw placed on the outside of the vessel. But in a community, where it is customary to pound in it, only pepper and similar spices, <italic>kashering</italic> with boiling water is sufficient.</p>
<p>7) In vessels that were used to age whiskey, the taste and aroma of the whiskey is not eliminated by <italic>kashering</italic> with boiling water. Only if you first boil them thoroughly in water and ashes, until the aroma has disappeared completely, can they then be <italic>kashered</italic> in boiling water.</p>
<p>8) The <italic>kashering</italic> of a barrel, should be done as follows: place heated stones in it, and pour boiling water on them out of the vessel, in which the water was boiled; then roll the barrel, so that the hot water will reach every part of it. The type of barrels which we use, are made of many planks hooped together and if they contained <italic>chametz</italic>, such as whiskey, or if flour, <italic>kashering</italic> is of no avail.</p>
<p>9) When a vessel requires <italic>kashering</italic> with boiling water, merely scouring the surface is of no avail,<sup><xref rid="fn415">7</xref></sup> it must be immersed in boiling water.</p>
<p>10) <italic>Kashering</italic> is of no avail regarding vessels that cannot be thoroughly cleaned, such as a sieve, the receptacle of a grinder, baskets used for keeping <italic>chametz</italic>, a grater, as well as any vessel that has a narrow opening, which is impossible to clean on the inside, (or a vessel) that has a spout.</p>
<p>11) A cabinet, in which food is kept<sup><xref rid="fn416">8</xref></sup> the entire year, and soup is sometimes spilled there from the pots, requires simple <italic>kashering</italic>, that is pouring boiling water on it;<sup><xref rid="fn417">9</xref></sup> but it must be poured out of the vessel, in which the water was boiled.<sup><xref rid="fn418">10</xref></sup> The water should not be thrown, but it should be poured in a steady stream. (As for <italic>kashering</italic>) tables, it is also customary to place glowing hot stones on the table, and pour boiling water on them, and then to move the stones from place to place in such a manner, that the boiling water covers the entire surface. The table must be scrubbed first, and after twenty-four hours, it should be <italic>kashered</italic>, in the manner described above. Nevertheless, some people are accustomed, not to use tables and chests even after <italic>kashering</italic>, without covering them with a cloth or something else.</p>
<p>12) Handles of vessels also require <italic>kashering</italic>. However, if the handle does not fit into the <italic>kashering</italic> pot, you should <italic>kasher</italic> the handle, by pouring boiling water on it.<sup><xref rid="fn419">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>13) Vessels used for drinking or measuring, also require <italic>kashering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn420">12</xref></sup> As for glassware, it is the custom in these regions not to <italic>kasher</italic> them.<sup><xref rid="fn421">13</xref></sup> Vessels made of metal, glazed on the inside, cannot be kashered by immersion in boiling water; but &#x201C;simple glowing&#x201D; is sufficient, just as with a mortar, see par. 6.</p>
<p>14) Only water should be used for <italic>kashering</italic>, and nothing should be mixed with it, not even ashes or similar substances. If you <italic>kashered</italic> many vessels in one <italic>kashering</italic> kettle, so that the water became thick and filmy like soup, you should not continue to <italic>kasher</italic> with it.</p>
<p>15) If you <italic>kasher</italic>, using a pair of tongs, to hold the vessel, you should relax your hold on the vessel, and then grip it firmly again; otherwise, the <italic>kashering</italic> water would not reach the spot held by the tongs. It is better to put the vessel in a net or in a basket. You should not put many vessels at one time into the kettle in which you <italic>kasher</italic>, so that they should not touch each other; otherwise, the place where they touch, would not be <italic>kashered</italic>.</p>
<p>16) You should not <italic>kasher</italic> a vessel that has been used the same day, that is, unless twenty-four hours have passed, since <italic>chametz</italic> was cooked in it. Likewise, the kettle, in which the <italic>kashering</italic> is done, should not have been used that same day. You should pay attention that the water is still bubbling when you put a vessel in the kettle. If the kettle, itself, has to be <italic>kashered</italic>, then, when the water is boiling, it must be full and you should throw glowing stones into it, so that the boiling water will overflow its rim. On <italic>erev Pesach, kashering</italic> must be done, only until midday.</p>
<p>17) It is customary, after <italic>kashering</italic>, to rinse the vessels with cold water.<sup><xref rid="fn422">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>18) If possible, the <italic>kashering</italic> should be done in the presence of a Torah scholar, who is well versed in the laws of <italic>kashering</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn409">1. This also applies, if the handle is made of any substance, that will be damaged by immersion in boiling water. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 451:23)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn410">2. If, however, you are <italic>kashering</italic>, by using charcoal or a blow-torch, you need not remove the rust, because the flame or heat will also remove the rust. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 451:24)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn411">3. This refers to other stains as well.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn412">4. Similarly, vessels, with a very narrow opening, that have rust in them, cannot be <italic>kashered</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 451:26; See also <italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</italic>, paragraph 10)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn413">5. Handles, that are attached with nails or screws, cannot be <italic>kashered</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 451:23)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn414">6. If, however, they were used for meat or fish and you are certain that <italic>chametz</italic> was never baked in them, it is sufficient to immerse them in boiling water. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 451:27)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn415">7. Because the entire thickness of the walls have absorbed the <italic>chametz</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 451:26)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn416">8. This is only when hot foods are kept in them, but otherwise, they do not require <italic>kashering</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 451:113)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn417">9. Others hold that since hot puddings, that contain <italic>chametz</italic>, are sometimes placed there, they require that hot stones be placed on them, (similar to <italic>kashering</italic> tables, that are discussed in this paragraph). (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 451:114)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn418">10. You must not use another vessel to dip into the vessel containing the boiling water and then pour it onto the surface from the second vessel. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 451:20)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn419">11. However, if you know, for certain, that the handles were immersed in boiling liquid, containing <italic>chametz</italic>; pouring hot water over them will not help, but they must be <italic>kashered</italic> in the regular way by immersion, then in boiling water. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 451:71)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn420">12. There is another method for <italic>kashering</italic> drinking glasses. If they have not been used during a twenty-four hour period, you may fill them, even with cold water, allowing the water to overflow, and then leave the water in the glasses for twenty-four hours. After twenty-four hours, you spill out the water and refill the glasses with new water. After twenty-four hours, you spill out the water and repeat the process a third time. This need not be done in consecutive days, so long as it was repeated thrice, as outlined. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 451:150)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn421">13. In a situation where new glasses cannot be purchased, and you have no other drinking vessels, the <italic>Chayei Adam</italic> writes that you may rely on the <italic>kashering</italic>, described in note 12 above. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 451:156)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn422">14. This should be done immediately, so that the vessel will not absorb the boiling water of the <italic>kashering</italic> vessel. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 452:34)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 117 Various Laws Concerning Pesach</title>
<p>1) If you find any <italic>chametz</italic> in food<sup><xref rid="fn423">1</xref></sup> on <italic>erev Pesach</italic>, anytime before nightfall, it is like any other forbidden substance, which is nullified if it becomes mixed (into a permitted subtance), sixty times its volume.<sup><xref rid="fn424">2</xref></sup> Therefore, if you find a grain of seed in poultry or in cooked food, you should throw away the seed, and you may eat the rest, even on <italic>Pesach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn425">3</xref></sup> But during <italic>Pesach</italic>, itself, even the smallest bit of <italic>chametz</italic> makes food forbidden (to eat) and to derive benefit from it. Thus, wherever you find a seed of the five species of grain, or a small particle of <italic>chametz</italic>, you should consult a competent <italic>Posek</italic>.</p>
<p>2) If grain seeds are found in a water well, you should not use this water, except in case of urgent need,<sup><xref rid="fn426">4</xref></sup> for example, if no other water is available. But if you find a piece of bread in the well, the water is forbidden to be used, even if no other water is available and even filtering is of no use.</p>
<p>3) It is the custom not to singe poultry with straw bearing ears of grain, for we are concerned that one of the seeds may be <italic>chametz</italic>. We, therefore, singe poultry with grass, or we cut the ears off of the straw. But, if inadvertently, (the poultry was singed with straw bearing ears of grain), the poultry may be used. You should take care to remove the crop from the poultry, before you singe it.<sup><xref rid="fn427">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>4) All kinds of legumes are forbidden;<sup><xref rid="fn428">6</xref></sup> and all kinds of dried fruit are forbidden, unless it is known that they have been dried in a proper way on planks, or in a stove that has been made kosher for <italic>Pesach</italic> (see above 110: 1 and 2). Even dried figs and raisins, whether large or small, are forbidden to be used; orange peels are also forbidden. Nevertheless, the beverage prepared from raisins, is customarily permitted to drink. It is the custom not to put cloves or saffron into food because they are suspect of containing <italic>chametz</italic>. Even in our regions, where saffron is raised in gardens, it is forbidden, in order not to make an exception (to the law). There are spices, including salt, that are not suspect of containing <italic>chametz</italic>. However, before putting them into the food, you should examine them to see whether there are any grain seeds in them.<sup><xref rid="fn429">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>5) You should only eat honey, that has not been removed from the comb, or honey, that has been taken out of the comb by a Jew, to be used specifically for <italic>Pesach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn430">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) In case of great urgency, for example, when it is needed for a sick or elderly person, it is permissible to bake matzos with eggs, fruit juice, milk, wine, or similar beverage, and this is called <italic>matzah ashirah</italic> (rich matzah). Care should be taken, however, not to mix any water with it. However on the first two nights of <italic>Pesach</italic>, actual matzah must be eaten; you have not fulfilled your duty, if you eat <italic>matzah ashirah</italic>. If there is no urgent need, it is forbidden to bake <italic>matzah ashirah</italic>, even before <italic>Pesach</italic>, to be used on <italic>Pesach</italic>.</p>
<p>7) If you feed grain or meal to fowl, you should be careful to put it in a dry place, so that it should not become wet. But it is forbidden to feed meal to cattle, since it becomes wet from their saliva; and when feeding them grain, you should be careful to give them a little at a time, so that no wet grain is left over. If there is any grain left over, you must clear it away immediately.</p>
<p>8) On <italic>erev Pesach</italic>, from the time <italic>chametz</italic> is forbidden, as well as during the entire week of Pesach, it is forbidden to derive any benefit, even from <italic>chametz</italic> belonging to a non-Jew. A Jew is, therefore, forbidden to haul or to guard <italic>chametz</italic>, belonging to a non-Jew. It goes without saying, that a Jew is forbidden to buy <italic>chametz</italic> for a non-Jew, even with the money belonging to the non-Jew.</p>
<p>9) During Pesach, it is forbidden to rent an animal to a non-Jew for the purpose of carrying <italic>chametz</italic> to him, or to rent him a room for the purpose of storing <italic>chametz</italic> in it, because it is forbidden to make profit from things, from which you are forbidden to benefit. But you are permitted to rent him an animal for the week of <italic>Pesach</italic> (except for Shabbos and Yom Tov), for an unspecified purpose,<sup><xref rid="fn431">9</xref></sup> as when the non-Jew does not expressly state that he needs the animal to haul <italic>chametz</italic>. Even if you know that the non-Jew will use it to haul <italic>chametz</italic>, it does not matter, because, even if the non-Jew hauls nothing with the animal, he will still have to pay you the full amount of the rental fee. Consequently, you do not profit at all from (the hauling of) the <italic>chametz</italic>. It is also permitted to rent him a room to live in on <italic>Pesach</italic>, even though you know, that he will bring <italic>chametz</italic> there; nevertheless, you do not receive payment for letting him bring in <italic>chametz</italic>; rather only rent for the room, for, even if he brought in no <italic>chametz</italic>, you would not reduce his rent.</p>
<p>10) You are forbidden to entrust, your animal to a non-Jew even a long time before <italic>Pesach</italic>, if you know that he will feed it <italic>chametz</italic> on <italic>Pesach</italic>.</p>
<p>11) You are permitted to say to your non-Jewish servant, even at a time, when it is forbidden to derive benefit from <italic>chametz</italic>, &#x201C;Here is money, buy yourself some food and eat,&#x201D; even if you know that he will buy <italic>chametz</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn432">10</xref></sup> If it is urgent, you are also allowed to say, &#x201C;Go and eat at the non-Jew&#x2019;s place, and I will pay him for it.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn433">11</xref></sup> Or you may say to another non-Jew, &#x201C;Give my servant something to eat, and I will pay you for it.&#x201D; But you are forbidden to pay in advance for the food he will give your servant.<sup><xref rid="fn434">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>12) If it is necessary to feed <italic>chametz</italic> to a baby, he should be carried to the house of a non-Jew.<sup><xref rid="fn435">13</xref></sup> The non-Jew should feed him the <italic>chametz</italic> and the Jew should pay him afterwards, but the Jew, himself, should not feed <italic>chametz</italic> to the baby. But if the baby&#x2019;s life is threatened, of course, everything is permitted, (as I have written in Ch. 92 and in Ch. 192 below).</p>
<p>13) Some authorities forbid drinking the milk of a cow, belonging to a non-Jew, that is fed <italic>chametz</italic> on <italic>Pesach</italic>, while others permit it. The scrupulous should follow the stricter opinion. Certainly in a community, where it is the custom to forbid it, God forbid, that anyone should permit it.</p>
<ftnote id="fn423">1. This is said, in reference to <italic>chametz</italic> in liquid form, that has become mixed with other liquid; or if the <italic>chametz</italic> has contributed to the taste of the mixture. Regarding dry <italic>chametz</italic>, that has been mixed with other dry foods, (see <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> and <italic>Ramah</italic> 447:4.)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn424">2. This is true also if the <italic>chametz</italic> and the other food are of the same species, i.e. vinegar and vinegar, soup and soup. (<italic>Biyur Halachah</italic> 447:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn425">3. This is true, only when the cooked food had been cooled before <italic>Pesach.</italic> (If the food was still warm on <italic>Pesach,</italic> it had absorbed the <italic>chametz</italic> on <italic>Pesach</italic> and would be forbidden). (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 447:19)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn426">4. This is certainly true if the seed is still whole, but only soft. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 467:62)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn427">5. Those who are scrupulous, in their observance, are careful to split the chicken in half, in order to examine it very carefully for any kernels of wheat or other <italic>chametz</italic>. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 467:86)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn428">6. They are forbidden, only so far as eating, but they may be kept over <italic>Pesach,</italic> and their benefit is not forbidden. When there is an urgent need, such as when there is no other food to eat, or for a sick person (who needs such food), it is permitted. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 453:6,7,12; 465:4) Some of the typical legumes that we must not eat are the various species of beans, rice and peas.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn429">7. Needless to say, that dried fruits, spices, salt, etc. are permitted in our times, when they have proper, authorative kosher certification.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn430">8. See note 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn431">9. This applies only to animals, but pots or other vessels, that are usually used for cooking, may not be rented to him, under any circumstances, because he will probably cook items containing <italic>chametz</italic> in them. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 450:11, <italic>Shaarei Tzion</italic> 46)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn432">10. It is forbidden, however, to say to him, &#x201C;Here is money, buy yourself some <italic>chametz</italic> (bread etc.) and eat.&#x201D; (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 450:15)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn433">11. Regarding servants, that you are responsible to feed, it is best not to tell them to buy food and charge it to you, but, rather, give them money and let them buy whatever they want. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 450:16,17)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn434">12. This is so, because you are responsible for their meals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn435">13. If it is impossible to carry the baby to the house of the non-Jew, and, therefore, the non-Jew must come into your house and feed him there, the non-Jew should remove any leftover <italic>chametz</italic> to his house, and bring it back when he returns to feed the child. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 450:18)</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 118 The Preparation for the Seder</title>
<p>1) You should do your best to obtain choice wine to perform the mitzvah of drinking the Four Cups. If red wine is available, that is, of the same quality as white wine, and its <italic>kashrus</italic> is as reliable as white wine, the red wine is preferred for the Four Cups, for it is said, &#x201C;Look not after wine when it is red,&#x201D; (Proverbs 23:31) indicating that wine is most desirable, when it is red. In addition, because it reminds us of the blood, which flowed, when Pharaoh slaughtered innocent Jewish children. In backward and ignorant countries, where people, make slanderous accusations, Jews refrain from using red wine on Pesach.</p>
<p>2) For the first dipping, which is called <italic>karpas</italic>, many people follow the custom of using parsley, but it is better to use celery, which tastes good when raw. Best of all is to use radishes.</p>
<p>3) For <italic>maror</italic> (bitter herbs), it is customary to use horseradish, which, may be grated,<sup><xref rid="fn436">1</xref></sup> because it is very sharp; but you should take care that it does not lose its strength completely. It should be grated, when you return home from the synagogue.<sup><xref rid="fn437">2</xref></sup> (see Ch. 98:3 that the grating should be in an unusual manner). On Shabbos, it is forbidden to grate the <italic>maror</italic>, but you should grate it before night, and keep it covered until nightfall.<sup><xref rid="fn438">3</xref></sup> However, it is preferable to use <italic>chazeres</italic>, lettuce, which is easier to eat,<sup><xref rid="fn439">4</xref></sup> and it is called <italic>maror</italic>, because when it stays in the ground for a long time, the stem becomes bitter. You can also fulfill the mitzvah with <italic>la&#x2019;anah</italic>, (an herb called wormwood).<sup><xref rid="fn440">5</xref></sup> (<italic>Alashin</italic> and <italic>charchevina</italic> [mentioned in the Mishnah], are not found in our region). All the species, with which you can fulfill the mitzvah (of eating <italic>maror</italic>), may be combined to make up a <italic>kazayis</italic>, and you may fulfill your duty with either the leaves or the stems, but not with the roots, that is not with the little roots, that branch out in all directions. But the large root, out of which the leaves grow, although it is hidden in the ground, is considered a stem. Nevertheless, it is better to use the leaves and the stem that is out of the ground, because some authorities hold that the part that grows in the ground is called &#x201C;root.&#x201D; The leaves are valid only if they are fresh, but the stems are valid whether they are fresh or dried out, but not when they are cooked or pickled.</p>
<p>4) The <italic>charoses</italic> must have a thick consistency<sup><xref rid="fn441">6</xref></sup> to recall the mortar from which our forefathers had to make bricks. When you are ready to dip the <italic>maror</italic> into it, you should add a little wine or vinegar to make it soft to represent the blood, and for the additional reason that it should become fit to dip something into it. The <italic>charoses</italic> should be made from fruits that symbolize the Jewish people; for example: figs, for it is said, &#x201C;The fig tree has produced its green figs,&#x201D; (Song of Songs 2:13); nuts, because it is said, &#x201C;I went down to the garden of nuts&#x201D; (ibid. 6:11); dates, because it is said, &#x201C;I will ascend the palm tree&#x201D; (ibid. 7:9); pomegranates, because it is said, &#x201C;Like a slice of pomegranate&#x201D; (ibid. 6:7); apples, to commemorate what is written, &#x201C;Beneath the apple tree I aroused you,&#x201D; (ibid. 8:5) where the women gave birth to their children without pain; and almonds, (<italic>shekeidim</italic>, singular <italic>shakeid</italic>), because the Holy One, blessed is He, watched diligently (<italic>shakad</italic>) to end our bondage. You should put spices in it, that look like straw, such as cinnamon and ginger, that are not finely ground,<sup><xref rid="fn442">7</xref></sup> and have straw-like strands in them, to recall the straw, the Jews used to knead into the mortar. On Shabbos, you should not pour the wine and the vinegar into the <italic>charoses</italic>, for it must be done in an unusual manner, by putting the <italic>charoses</italic> into the wine or the vinegar. The salt water, (even when Yom Tov does not occur on Shabbos)<sup><xref rid="fn443">8</xref></sup> should be prepared on <italic>erev Yom Tov</italic>). If you do prepare it on Yom Tov, you should do it in an unusual way,<sup><xref rid="fn444">9</xref></sup> by pouring the water first, and adding the salt later.</p>
<p>5) After the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> was destroyed, the Sages ordained that there should be two cooked foods on the table, during the reciting of the <italic>Haggadah</italic>, one to recall the <italic>Korban Pesach</italic>, (Passover sacrifice), the other to recall the <italic>Korban Chagigah</italic> (Festival sacrifice), which were offered in the times when the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> was standing. It is customary that one of the foods should be meat, from the shoulder section,<sup><xref rid="fn445">10</xref></sup> to recall that the Holy One, blessed is He, redeemed Yisrael, with an outstretched arm. It should be roasted on fire, to recall the <italic>Korban Pesach</italic> (Passover sacrifice), which was roasted on fire. The second food should be an egg,<sup><xref rid="fn446">11</xref></sup> because an egg, in the Aramean language is <italic>beiah</italic>, that is to say, the Merciful One desired (<italic>ba&#x2019;ei</italic>) to redeem us with an outstretched arm. You may prepare the egg, either roasted or boiled, but you must do the roasting or boiling on <italic>erev Yom Tov</italic>, while it is still daylight. If you forgot to do it (on <italic>erev Yom Tov</italic>), or if that day occurred on Shabbos, you should roast or boil it at night, but then you must eat it on the first day of Yom Tov. The same goes for the second night; you should roast it or boil it (at night), and you must eat it on the second day of Yom Tov, for you are not permitted to cook on the first day of Yom Tov for the second day, and neither on a Yom Tov for a weekday. Now, since it is customary not to eat roasted meats on the two nights of the <italic>seder</italic>, you should, therefore, eat the shoulder meat on Yom Tov during the day. Even if you roasted it on <italic>erev Yom Tov</italic>, you should not throw away (the meat) afterwards, but you should put it into the food that is cooked on the second day and eat it on the second day.</p>
<p>6) You should prepare your seat [at the table] while it is still daytime, with the nicest pillows you can afford, placing them in such a way that you can recline and lean on the left side. Even a left-handed person should recline on the left side. You should also prepare the <italic>seder</italic> plate while it is still day, in order that immediately on returning home from the synagogue you can begin the <italic>seder</italic> without delay.</p>
<p>7) Although during the year, it is best to be moderate in displaying fine tableware, so that we remember the destruction of the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, nevertheless, on the night of <italic>Pesach</italic>, it is good to set the table with as many beautiful things as are within your means. Even vessels not used for the meal should be placed on the table for elegant decor, to symbolize freedom.</p>
<p>8) The <italic>seder</italic> plate is arranged in this manner: You place three matzos on the <italic>seder</italic> plate, you cover them with a beautiful cloth, you place the shankbone on your right side, and the egg on the left; the <italic>maror</italic>, over which you say the berachah, you place in the center; the <italic>charoses</italic>, you place below the shankbone; the <italic>karpas</italic> below the egg, and the <italic>maror</italic>, that is eaten together with the matzah, you place in the center; as in the diagram:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>egg</td>
<td>shankbone</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><italic>maror</italic> (for berachah)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><italic>karpas</italic></td>
<td><italic>charoses</italic></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><italic>maror</italic> (for <italic>korech</italic>)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>9) The wine cups must be whole, without any defect, thoroughly rinsed,<sup><xref rid="fn447">12</xref></sup> and they must hold no less than a <italic>revi&#x2019;is</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn448">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>10) It is our custom to wear a <italic>kittel</italic> (a white robe), which should also be prepared, while it is still day. A person, in mourning, God forbid, should not wear it, but he is required to recline. However, if he has observed no mourning at all before Yom Tov, as, for example, if the funeral was held on Yom Tov, then, it is customary that he should not recline. But he must recite <italic>Hallel</italic>, because the saying of <italic>Hallel</italic> is mandatory.</p>
<p>11) A son, at his father&#x2019;s table, is required to recline, but a student, in the presence of his <italic>Rebbe</italic>, is not required to recline.</p>
<ftnote id="fn436">1. It should never be eaten, when it is whole, because it could be very dangerous to your health and, thus, it is not a mitzvah. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 473:36)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn437">2. After grating, it should be covered until the beginning of the <italic>Seder,</italic> in order that it does not lose its strength completely. (<italic>Ibid</italic>.)</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn440">5. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> says, that according to <italic>Ramah,</italic> wormwood is not acceptable as a species of <italic>maror.</italic> Others rule that it is. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 473:46)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn441">6. The <italic>charoses</italic> should be prepared <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov. If, however, you forgot, it may then be made on Yom Tov (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 473:47)</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn444">9. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> makes no mention of preparing the salt water in an unusual manner on Yom Tov, when it <italic>does not</italic> occur on Shabbos. It would seem that he maintains that it is permitted to prepare it on Yom Tov in the usual manner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn445">10. If you cannot obtain a shoulder piece, you may use other meat, even without a bone. The <italic>Poskim</italic> write that when a bone is used, there should be some meat on it, to recall the <italic>Korban Pesach.</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 473.27)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn446">11. According to <italic>Mishnah Berurah,</italic> you may use two kinds of meat, one roasted, to recall the <italic>Korban Pesach,</italic> and one boiled, to recall the <italic>Korban Chagigah.</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 473:27)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn447">12. If they are wiped clean, with a cloth, both inside and outside, it is also acceptable.

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 119 The Seder</title>
<p>1) Although on every other Shabbos and Yom Tov, you are permitted to say <italic>kiddush</italic> and eat a meal while it is still day, in order to add from the secular to the holy, on <italic>Pesach</italic>, you are not permitted to do so. The mitzvah of eating matzah must be performed only at night, as was the case with the <italic>Pesach</italic> sacrifice, about which it is written, &#x201C;And they shall eat the meat (of the <italic>Korban Pesach</italic>) on this night.&#x201D; (Exodus 12:8). The mitzvah of the Four Cups may also be done only after nightfall. Since the cup of wine, over which we say <italic>kiddush</italic>, is one of the Four Cups, the <italic>kiddush</italic> should not be said until it is definitely night.<sup><xref rid="fn449">1</xref></sup> (The person who conducts the <italic>seder</italic>) puts on the kittel and takes his seat to conduct the <italic>seder</italic>. It is a mitzvah to distribute almonds, nuts and similar things to the children, so that they notice the change and ask questions, and this will also stimulate them to ask also the reasons for eating matzah, <italic>maror</italic> and reclining.<sup><xref rid="fn450">2</xref></sup> Boys and girls who have reached the age of training for mitzvos, that is, who are able to understand the holiness of Yom Tov and understand what is being told about the Exodus from Egypt, should also be given a cup of wine,<sup><xref rid="fn451">3</xref></sup> from which they should drink. It is customary to fill an additional cup of wine,<sup><xref rid="fn452">4</xref></sup> and it is called &#x201C;The Cup of Elijah the Prophet.&#x201D;</p>
<p>2) A servant or a member of the household should fill the cups, and each time the cups are filled, they should fill them, rather than doing it yourself. This conveys an impression of freedom. You should instruct the members of the household to drink at least the greater part of each cup at one time,<sup><xref rid="fn453">5</xref></sup> and of the fourth cup, they should drink a <italic>revi&#x2019;is</italic> at one time.<sup><xref rid="fn454">6</xref></sup> All should have in mind to fulfill the mitzvah of drinking the Four Cups (of wine), and of relating the story of the Exodus, and eating matzah and <italic>maror</italic>, because women, too, are required to perform these mitzvos, except that they do not recline. You recite the <italic>kiddush</italic>, as it is written in the <italic>Haggadah</italic>, and drink the wine while reclining on your left side. It is best, if possible, to follow the opinion of the authorities, and to drink the entire contents of all the Four Cups.</p>
<p>3) After that, you should wash your hands,<sup><xref rid="fn455">7</xref></sup> without saying the berachah, dry them, and cut the <italic>karpas</italic> for yourself and for all the members of the household, giving each less than a <italic>kazayis</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn456">8</xref></sup> Each dips his portion in salt water and says the berachah <italic>Borei peri ha&#x2019;adamah</italic> &#x201C;Who creates the fruit of the ground.&#x201D; They should have in mind to exempt the <italic>maror</italic> which will be eaten later with this berachah, and while eating the <italic>karpas</italic>, they should also recline on the left side.<sup><xref rid="fn457">9</xref></sup> The person who leads the Seder then takes the middle matzah and breaks it into two parts, placing the larger part near his seat for the <italic>afikoman</italic>. It is customary to wrap the <italic>afikoman</italic> in a napkin,<sup><xref rid="fn458">10</xref></sup> to recall what is written, &#x201C;Their leftover dough was wrapped in their clothes&#x201D; (Exodus 12:34). Some people place it on their shoulders, to recall the Exodus. Since the <italic>afikoman</italic> takes the place of the <italic>Pesach</italic> sacrifice, it is most esteemed, and the larger portion of the matzah is set aside for it. The smaller portion, is put back on the <italic>seder</italic> plate. He then uncovers the matzos slightly, lifts the <italic>seder</italic> plate, and all declare <italic>Ha lachma anya diachalu</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn459">11</xref></sup> &#x201C;This is the bread of affliction, which our forefathers ate etc. to <italic>leshanah haba&#x2019;ah benei chorin</italic>, &#x201C;Next year we shall be free men.&#x201D; Those who say, <italic>Keha lachma anya</italic> (<italic>keha</italic> instead of <italic>ha</italic>), &#x201C;Such as this bread of affliction,&#x201D; should omit the word <italic>di</italic> (which).</p>
<p>4) The second cup is now filled, and a child asks: <italic>Mah nishtanah</italic> &#x201C;Why is this night different.&#x201D; If there is no child present, then an older son or daughter should ask, or a friend or your wife should ask.<sup><xref rid="fn460">12</xref></sup> Then <italic>Avadim hayinu</italic> (we were slaves) etc. is said.<sup><xref rid="fn461">13</xref></sup> It is proper to explain to the members of the family<sup><xref rid="fn462">14</xref></sup> the contents of the <italic>Haggadah</italic> in the language they understand.<sup><xref rid="fn463">15</xref></sup> If you do not understand Hebrew, you should use a <italic>Haggadah</italic> with a translation, and after completing each paragraph, you should repeat from the translation, and particularly, the declaration, <italic>Rabban Gamliel hayah omeir</italic> (Rabban Gamliel used to say,) because it is essential to understand the reasons for the <italic>Pesach</italic> sacrifice, matzah and <italic>maror</italic>. At <italic>Vehi she&#x2019;amedah</italic> (this promise) etc. you should cover the matzos (so that the matzah is not slighted when it seems that we are ignoring it, by lifting only the cup of wine). All take their cups in their hands and say, <italic>Vehi she&#x2019;amedah</italic>, to <italic>miyadam</italic>, (from their hands), when you again uncover the matzos. When you say <italic>Matzah zo</italic> (this matzah) etc., you should take the half matzah from the <italic>seder</italic> plate, and show it to the family and say, <italic>Matzah zo</italic> (this matzah etc.). When saying <italic>Maror zeh</italic> (this <italic>maror</italic>), you should lift the <italic>maror</italic>. However, when saying <italic>Pesach shehayu avoseinu ochelim</italic> (the <italic>Pesach</italic> offering which our fathers ate etc.), you should not raise the shankbone, which is a reminder of the <italic>Pesach</italic> offering, for it might appear as if you had set it apart for a <italic>Pesach</italic> offering, (which can only be done in the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>). When saying, <italic>Lefichach</italic> (Therefore), you should cover the matzos, and each person takes his cup in his hand and raises it, holding it until concluding with <italic>Ga&#x2019;al Yisrael</italic>, (Who redeemed Israel). Everyone then says the berachah, <italic>Borei peri hagafen</italic>, over their cup of wine, and drink the cup, while reclining on the left side.</p>
<p>5) After that, everyone should wash their hands, and say the berachah, <italic>Al netilas yadayim</italic>, and <italic>Hamotzi</italic> over the matzos. Since on Yom Tov, we must say <italic>Hamotzi</italic> over two whole loaves of bread, and the mitzvah of matzah requires that we eat the broken one, because matzah is called &#x201C;poor man&#x2019;s bread,&#x201D; and a poor man generally eats broken pieces of bread, therefore, when saying <italic>Hamotzi</italic>, you should take the two whole matzos in your hands and the broken one between them, and recite <italic>Hamotzi</italic>. You then put down the bottom matzah,<sup><xref rid="fn464">16</xref></sup> holding only the top, and the broken middle matzah, and say the berachah, <italic>Al achilat matzah</italic>. You then break off a piece the size of a <italic>kazayis</italic>, from the top matzah and from the broken middle matzah.<sup><xref rid="fn465">17</xref></sup> You distribute the same quantity to every member of the family. Then you eat both pieces simultaneously,<sup><xref rid="fn466">18</xref></sup> while reclining on the left side.<sup><xref rid="fn467">19</xref></sup> If it is difficult for you to eat both pieces of matzah at the same time, you should first eat the <italic>kazayis</italic> piece over which you said <italic>Hamotzi</italic>, and then eat the <italic>kazayis</italic> piece from the broken matzah. But you should not pause between eating the two pieces, and eat both pieces while reclining. It is the custom in our region, at the <italic>seder</italic>, not to dip the matzah in salt; neither the matzah, over which <italic>Hamotzi</italic> is said, nor the one over which <italic>Al achilas matzah</italic> is said.</p>
<p>6) If someone is unable to chew the matzah, he is permitted to soak it in water<sup><xref rid="fn468">20</xref></sup> to soften it,<sup><xref rid="fn469">21</xref></sup> provided it is not completely mashed. An elderly or sick person, who cannot eat matzah, when soaked in water, may soak it in wine, or in any other beverage.<sup><xref rid="fn470">22</xref></sup> When you soak the matzah, with which you want to fulfill the mitzvah (of eating matzah), you must be careful not to soak it for twenty-four hours, for it would then be considered as if it were cooked and you could not fulfill the mitzvah with it. You must also be careful, in other respects, that the matzah should not lose its status as bread. See Chapter 48:5 above.</p>
<p>7) You then take a <italic>kazayis</italic> of <italic>maror</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn471">23</xref></sup> and distribute portions of the same quantity to each member of the family. You dip it in the <italic>charoses</italic>, and shake off the <italic>charoses</italic>, so that the <italic>maror</italic> should not lose its taste, and say the berachah, <italic>Al achilas maror</italic>, and eat it<sup><xref rid="fn472">24</xref></sup> <italic>without</italic> reclining.<sup><xref rid="fn473">25</xref></sup> You then take a <italic>kazayis</italic> from the bottom matzah and a <italic>kazayis maror</italic>. It is also proper to dip (this <italic>maror</italic>) in <italic>charoses</italic> and shake it off. You then place the <italic>maror</italic> between (two pieces of) matzah and say, <italic>Kein asa Hillel</italic> (This is the way Hillel did it) etc.<sup><xref rid="fn474">26</xref></sup> and eat it while reclining.<sup><xref rid="fn475">27</xref></sup> The size of a <italic>kazayis</italic>, as we have written in the general rules, is as much as half an egg.<sup><xref rid="fn476">28</xref></sup> However, some authorities hold, that it is a little less than one-third of an egg. Since the mitzvah of eating <italic>maror</italic> is in our days a rabbinical requirement, therefore, a person, who finds it difficult to eat <italic>maror</italic>, may rely on this (more lenient) opinion, and eat a little less than one third of an egg, and say the berachah over it. A person who is sick and cannot eat <italic>maror</italic> at all, should, nevertheless, chew a little of any of the species, with which the mitzvah of <italic>maror</italic> may be fulfilled, or any bitter tasting herb, until he feels a bitter taste in his mouth; just as a token, without saying a berachah.</p>
<p>8) After that the meal begins. It is proper to eat the entire meal<sup><xref rid="fn477">29</xref></sup> while reclining It is customary to eat eggs. It is wise to use good judgment, and not overeat, so that you will be able to eat the <italic>afikoman</italic>, as required, (with appetite), and not on a full stomach.<sup><xref rid="fn478">30</xref></sup> Roast meat should not be eaten, on the two <italic>seder</italic> nights, not even roast poultry. Even if it was boiled and then pot roasted, it should not be eaten. Some have the custom not to eat any food dipped in liquid, on the <italic>seder</italic> nights, except the two required dipped foods, so that it should be prominently recognized that these two are mitzvos. After completing the meal, the <italic>afikoman</italic> is eaten<sup><xref rid="fn479">31</xref></sup> to remind us of the <italic>Pesach</italic> sacrifice,<sup><xref rid="fn480">32</xref></sup> which was eaten at the end of the meal so that you should be completely satiated. It is proper to eat two <italic>kazeisim</italic> (of matzah for the <italic>afikoman</italic>), one to remind us of the <italic>Pesach</italic> sacrifice, and the other to recall the matzah that was eaten with the <italic>korban Pesach</italic> . At any rate, you should not eat less than a <italic>kazayis</italic>, and you should eat the <italic>afikoman</italic>, while reclining. After eating the <italic>afikoman</italic>, it is forbidden to eat anything.<sup><xref rid="fn481">33</xref> <xref rid="fn482">34</xref></sup> The third cup is then filled for <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>. You must make sure that it is clean, not containing leftover wine, that is to say, nothing is left from the wine, in which matzah may have been soaked during the meal. If it is not clean, it requires washing and rinsing (See Chapter 45:4 above). It is a mitzvah to make an effort to recite <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> with <italic>zimun</italic> (three males), but you should not go from house to house to look for people required for <italic>zimun</italic>, because each person is required to say <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> in the place where he has eaten. It is customary for the master of the house to lead the <italic>zimun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn483">35</xref></sup> as it is said: &#x201C;A man of a good eye shall bless,&#x201D; (Proverbs 22:9) (see Ch. 45:5) and he is called, &#x201C;A man of good eye,&#x201D; (i.e. a generous person) because he said: &#x201C;All who are hungry&#x2014;let them come and eat&#x201D; etc. After <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, the berachah is said over the third cup, and you should drink it while reclining. It is forbidden to drink between this cup and the fourth cup.</p>
<p>9) After <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, the fourth cup is filled. It is the custom to open the door, to remind us that tonight is a night of Divine vigil, and we are not afraid of anything. In the merit of our faith in Hashem, our righteous <italic>Mashiach</italic> will come, and the Holy One, blessed is He, will pour out his anger on the nations. Therefore, we recite <italic>Shefoch chamasecha</italic> (Pour out Your anger) etc. After that, we say, <italic>Lo lanu</italic> (Not for us) and continue reciting the <italic>Hallel</italic>. When we reach <italic>Hodu</italic> (Give thanks), if there are three people present, even if they are his wife and children, who have reached the age of training for mitzvos, the leader should say <italic>Hodu</italic>, and the other two people respond, as it is done in the synagogue. You are required to drink a full revi&#x2019;s<sup><xref rid="fn484">36</xref></sup> from the fourth cup, after which you say the after-berachah.<sup><xref rid="fn485">37</xref></sup> You then recite the <italic>Haggadah</italic> to the end. After the fourth cup, it is forbidden to drink any beverage, except water.<sup><xref rid="fn486">38</xref></sup> If you are not too sleepy, you should say <italic>Shir hashirim</italic> after the <italic>Hagadah</italic>. It is customary not to say the bedtime <italic>Shema</italic>, except for the section of <italic>Shema</italic> and the berachah <italic>Hamapil</italic>, to indicate that it is a night of divine vigil when Hashem protects us from all evil, and we need no other protection.</p>
<p>10) A person, who does not drink wine all year, because it causes him discomfort, nevertheless should make a special effort to drink the Four Cups, as our Rabbis, of blessed memory, relate about Rabbi Yehudah bar Rabbi Ilai, who used to drink the Four Cups of wine on <italic>Pesach</italic>, and then he would have to wrap his temples until <italic>Shavuos</italic> (because of the headache the wine gave him). However, such a person may dilute the wine with water, or drink raisin wine, (see Chapter 50:6 above), or he may drink mead, if these are the &#x201C;beverage of the country&#x201D;</p>
<p>11) If the <italic>afikoman</italic> was lost, and you still have matzah left of those that were made specifically for the mitzvah, you should eat a <italic>kazayis</italic> of that matzah, otherwise, you should eat a <italic>kazayis</italic> of any other matzah.</p>
<p>12) If you forgot to eat the <italic>afikoman;</italic> and reminded yourself before saying <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, although you already had washed your hands at the end of the meal or said, &#x201C;Come, let us say the blessings,&#x201D; you may eat the <italic>afikoman</italic>, and do not have to say <italic>Hamotzi</italic>. And even though you had not intended to eat anymore, this does not constitute a diversion of the mind, since it is your duty to eat the <italic>afikoman</italic>, and are sitting at Hashem&#x2019;s table, (and must fulfill His will; thus you were not completely distracted). Nevertheless, you should wash your hands, without saying <italic>Al netilas yadayim</italic>. But if you did not remind yourself, until after saying <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, before saying <italic>Borei peri hagafen</italic> over the third cup, then you should wash your hands again, without saying, <italic>Al netilas yadayim</italic>, and recite the berachah of <italic>Hamotzi</italic>, eat a <italic>kazayis</italic> of the <italic>afikoman</italic>, say <italic>Birkas Hamazon;</italic> then say the berachah over the third cup, and drink it. But if you only reminded yourself after saying <italic>Borei peri hagafen</italic> over the third cup, you should drink the cup. If on other occasions you are accustomed to recite <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, without a cup of wine, you should wash your hands, eat the <italic>afikoman</italic>, and say <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> without a cup of wine. However, if you are scrupulous, and always says <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, over a cup of wine, and now cannot do it, because you would be adding to the four cups, (which is forbidden), then you should not eat the <italic>afikoman</italic>, but rely on the matzah, which you ate before.</p>

<ftnote id="fn450">2. These questions are included in the text of the <italic>Haggadah, Mah Nishtanah.</italic> It is important to keep the children at the table until after <italic>Avodim Hayinu</italic> is recited and explained to them, because this section of the <italic>Haggadah</italic> explains the questions, previously asked by the children. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 472:50)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn451">3. It is considered a mitzvah to give them a cup of wine, but it is not required to do so, since many <italic>Poskim</italic> ruled that the mitzvah of the Four Cups was never ordained for children. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 472:46,47)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn452">4. It is not clearly stated, when the Cup of Elijah should be filled. The fact that the <italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</italic> mentions it, in this paragraph, could indicate that he maintains that it be filled, when the first cups are filled for <italic>Kiddush</italic>. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> mentions the filling of the Cup of Elijah, in the paragraph dealing with the text, <span dir="rtl">&#xFB2A;&#x05BD;&#x05E4;&#xFB4B;&#xE802; &#x05D7;&#x05B2;&#x05DE;&#x05B8;&#x05EA;&#x05B0;&#xE803;</span> (Pour out Your wrath etc.), which comes much later after <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn453">5. If the cup holds only a <italic>revi&#x2019;is,</italic> you should, initially, drink the entire cup of wine.

<ftnote id="fn455">7. The reason for washing the hands, at this point, is because the <italic>karpas</italic> must be dipped in salt water, and before eating food that is dipped in liquid, such as wine, honey, oil, milk, dew, blood or water it is required that you wash your hands.

<ftnote id="fn469">21. This leniency applies only when a whole matzah is soaked in one piece, but if it is broken into pieces and then soaked until the water becomes discolored from the matzah, it cannot be used to fulfill the mitzvah, as it is no longer considered bread.

<ftnote id="fn470">22. A healthy, young person cannot fulfill his obligation, if the matzah was soaked in any liquid, except water. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 461:18)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 120 The Laws of Counting the Omer and the Days of Sefirah</title>
<p>1) On the second night of Pesach, we begin counting the <italic>Omer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn487">1</xref></sup> You should stand during the counting.<sup><xref rid="fn488">2</xref></sup> The mitzvah requires that the <italic>Omer</italic> be counted, as soon as possible after nightfall,<sup><xref rid="fn489">3</xref></sup> after (three medium-size star) stars begin to appear. If you did not count at the beginning of the evening, you may count the entire night. In the synagogue, on the eve of Shabbos and Yom Tov, we count after the <italic>Kiddush</italic> is said, in order to give precedence to the (proclamation of the) holiness of the day.<sup><xref rid="fn490">4</xref></sup> At the conclusion of Shabbos and Yom Tov, we count before the <italic>Havdalah</italic> is said, in order to delay the end of the day. If the last day of Yom Tov occurs on Shabbos night, when the <italic>Kiddush</italic> and the <italic>Havdalah</italic> are said over one [the same] cup of wine, we also count before, in order to postpone the <italic>Havdalah</italic>.</p>
<p>2) If you forgot to count during the night, you should count during the daytime, but without a berachah. On subsequent nights, you may count with a berachah. If you neglected to count an entire day, you should count on all subsequent nights, without saying the berachah.<sup><xref rid="fn491">5</xref></sup> If you are not sure whether or not you counted that night, even though you did not count on the following day, nevertheless, you may count the remaining days with a berachah.</p>
<p>3) If someone asks you, during twilight or later, &#x201C;What is tonight&#x2019;s count?&#x201D; You should tell him, &#x201C;Yesterday was such-and-such,&#x201D; for if you would tell him today&#x2019;s count, you are not permitted to say the berachah, when you count the <italic>Omer</italic> later that night.<sup><xref rid="fn492">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>4) Before saying the berachah, you should know what the berachah is for; that is, you should know the exact number of days of the <italic>Omer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn493">7</xref></sup> However, if you did not know it, and began the berachah with the intention of counting the number you will hear from your neighbor, you have also fulfilled your obligation. Similarly if you say the berachah with the intention of counting four days, but after completing the berachah, you realize that you should have counted five days, you should count five [days], and need not repeat the berachah. Similarly, if you made an error in counting, for example you should have said &#x201C;six days,&#x201D; but you said &#x201C;five days,&#x201D; if you realize it immediately,<sup><xref rid="fn494">8</xref></sup> you should count the correct number, and you need not repeat the berachah; but if you made a short pause, you must repeat the berachah.</p>
<p>5) When the first night of the Yom Tov occurs on Shabbos, <italic>ma&#x2019;aravis</italic> are omitted,<sup><xref rid="fn495">9</xref></sup> and, on the second night of Yom Tov, we say the <italic>ma&#x2019;aravis</italic> of the first night. On Pesach, however, even if the first night occurs on Shabbos, nevertheless, on the second night we say the <italic>ma&#x2019;aravis</italic> pertaining to that night, because it deals with the harvesting of the <italic>Omer</italic> which took place on that night.</p>
<p>6) During [the first] thirty-three days of the <italic>Sefirah</italic> period (the counting of the <italic>Omer</italic>), the disciples of Rabbi Akiva perished. Therefore, it is the custom during these days to observe a partial state of mourning:<sup><xref rid="fn496">10</xref></sup> Marriages should not be performed and you should not take a haircut (or shave).<sup><xref rid="fn497">11</xref></sup> There are various customs regarding (the day on which to begin) to count these thirty-three days. Some communities have the custom of counting them beginning with the first day of the <italic>Omer</italic>, and, therefore, they forbid [weddings and haircuts] until <italic>Lag ba&#x2019;omer</italic> (the 33rd day of the <italic>Omer</italic>). But when <italic>Rosh Chodesh Iyar</italic> occurs on Shabbos, which has two levels of <italic>kedushah</italic> (sanctity), the <italic>kedushah</italic> of Shabbos and the <italic>kedushah</italic> of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>, they permit marriages and haircuts on <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>. On <italic>Lag ba&#x2019;omer</italic> and from that day on, the restrictions are permitted, because on <italic>Lag ba&#x2019;omer</italic> [Rabbi Akiva&#x2019;s disciples] ceased to die. We, therefore, rejoice somewhat, and we do not say <italic>Tachanun</italic> on that day. Although on that very day some of them died (mourning need not be observed for a full day), for the <italic>Halachah</italic> states, a part of a day is considered as a full day; therefore, you should not take a haircut, nor should weddings be held; until after dawn (of <italic>Lag ba&#x2019;omer</italic>), but not in the evening. But if <italic>Lag ba&#x2019;omer</italic> occurs on Sunday, you may take a haircut on the preceding <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>, in honor of Shabbos.</p>
<p>7) In other communities, they permit (weddings and haircuts) until <italic>Rosh Chodesh Iyar</italic>, inclusive, which adds up to sixteen days. This leaves thirty-three days, during which these things are forbidden, [that is] until <italic>Shavuos</italic>, (but they permit haircuts on <italic>erev Shavuos</italic>). Nevertheless, on <italic>Lag ba&#x2019;omer</italic> they permit (weddings and haircuts); (and if <italic>Lag ba&#x2019;omer</italic> occurs on Sunday, they permit them on <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>, as I have written above.) In still other communities, they permit (these things) until <italic>Rosh Chodesh Iyar</italic>, exclusive of that day, and on the first day of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>, the restrictions begin to apply. On the first of the three days of <italic>Hagbalah</italic> [the three days preceding <italic>Shavuos</italic>,] which is the thirty-third day (of the period the restrictions are in effect), they apply the rule, &#x201C;A part of day is considered as a full day,&#x201D; and they, therefore, permit marriages and haircuts during these three days, as well as on <italic>Lag ba&#x2019;omer</italic>, (as I have written above). It is essential that the entire community follow the same custom, and not that some follow one custom and others follow a different custom.</p>
<p>8) The <italic>Sandak</italic>, (the person who holds the infant during the <italic>bris</italic> circumcision), the <italic>mohel</italic>, and the father of the infant, are permitted to take a haircut (and shave) on the day before the <italic>bris</italic>, towards evening, before going to the synagogue.<sup><xref rid="fn498">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>9) Engagement parties, even with a meal, are permitted during all the <italic>Sefirah</italic> days; but dancing is forbidden.</p>
<p>10) It is the custom that no work is performed, by either men or women during the <italic>Sefirah</italic> days, from sunset, until after the counting of the <italic>Omer</italic>. There is an allusion for this (in the Torah), because it is said, &#x201C;Seven weeks&#x201D; (Leviticus 23:15). [The word <italic>shabbasos</italic>, meaning weeks,] is derived from <italic>shevos</italic>, denoting rest, indicating that during the time we count the <italic>Omer</italic>, that is from sunset on, you should rest [refrain] from doing any work, until after you have counted the <italic>Omer</italic>.</p>
<p>11) On the first night of <italic>Shavuos</italic>, the <italic>Maariv</italic> service is delayed, until the stars come out, for, if we would hold the service before this time, and usher in the Yom Tov, a bit of time will be lacking from the forty-nine days of the <italic>Sefirah</italic>, and the Torah says, &#x201C;They shall be seven <italic>complete</italic> weeks&#x201D; (Leviticus 23:15).</p>
<ftnote id="fn487">1. Since this is a mitzvah, that is done only at a certain, specific time, women are exempt from counting the <italic>Omer</italic>. <italic>Magein Avraham</italic> says that women have since accepted this mitzvah as an obligation, but <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> says that in our areas, women are not accustomed to count the <italic>Omer</italic>. He quotes from <italic>Shulchan Shlomo</italic> that women certainly should not say the berachah. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 489:3)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn488">2. You should also stand for the berachah. If, however, you did count while sitting, you have still fulfilled your obligation (and you need not count over again). (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 489:6)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn489">3. Counting the <italic>Omer</italic> is done after the <italic>Maariv</italic> prayer, before saying <italic>Aleinu</italic>. Later <italic>Poskim</italic> rule, however, once the stars have appeared, the <italic>Omer</italic> may be counted even before <italic>Maariv</italic>. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 489:2,18)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn490">4. At home, however, we must count the <italic>Omer</italic> before <italic>Kiddush</italic>, as it is forbidden to eat before counting the <italic>Omer</italic>. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 489:39)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn491">5. This law also applies, if you realized you counted the wrong <italic>Sefirah</italic> yesterday. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 489:35)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn492">6. However, if, for example, you just said the number twelve, without saying <italic>today is the twelfth day,</italic> you can still count the <italic>Omer</italic> with a berachah. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 489:22)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn493">7. The later <italic>Poskim</italic> rule that it is permitted to count the <italic>Omer</italic> in any language you understand.

<ftnote id="fn498">12. If the <italic>bris</italic> (circumcision) will be held on Shabbos, they are permitted to take a haircut or shave on Friday, even before midday. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 493:13)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 121 Laws Concerning Public Fast Days</title>
<p>1) It is a positive commandment, ordained by the Prophets, to fast on those days on which tragic events occurred to our forefathers. The purpose of the fast is to stir our hearts to reflect on the ways of repentance, and to serve as a reminder of our own evil deeds,and the deeds of our forefathers, which were as reprehensible as ours, and caused all these troubles for them as well as for us. By remembering these events we will improve our ways, as it has been said, &#x201C;They will then confess their sins and the sins of their fathers&#x201D; (Leviticus 26:4). Therefore, it is everyone&#x2019;s duty to take it to heart on those days to examine his past actions and to repent; for fasting is not the main thing, as it was said about the people of Nineveh, &#x201C;And God saw their deeds&#x201D; (Jonah 3:10), and our Rabbis, of blessed memory, have said, &#x201C;It does not say, &#x2018;He saw their sackcloth and their fast,&#x2019; but &#x2018;God saw their deeds, that they had turned away from their evil ways.&#x2019;&#x201D; Fasting is only a preparation for repentance. Therefore those who while fasting, spend the time taking walks, and doing trivial things, take hold of the least important aspect of the fast, while ignoring the essence [of the fast.]</p>
<p>2) These are the fast days: <bold>the third day of <italic>Tishrei</italic></bold>, when Gedaliah, the son of Achikam, was killed. After the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> was destroyed, Nebuchadnezzar left him in <italic>Eretz Yisrael</italic>, and appointed him governor over Yisrael. Because he [Gedaliah] was assassinated, all Jews were exiled and thousands of them were killed; thus, the last ember of Jewish hope died.</p>
<p>3) <bold>The tenth day of <italic>Teiveis</italic></bold> (is a fast day), because the king of Babylonia, the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, approached Jerusalem, and laid seige to it and crushed it; and this ultimately led to the destruction of the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>.</p>
<p>4) <bold>The seventeenth day of <italic>Tammuz</italic></bold> (is a fast day) because five tragic events occured on that day: 1) the Tablets [of the Covenant] were broken by Moses, when he came down from Mount Sinai, as it is written in the Torah, and this occurred on the seventeenth day of <italic>Tammuz</italic>. 2) The continual daily sacrifices were abolished. 3) (The Romans) broke through the wall of Jerusalem during the destruction of the second <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>. Although, during the destruction of the first <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, the wall was breached on the ninth of <italic>Tammuz</italic>, as it is written, &#x201C;In the fourth month, on the ninth of the month, the famine was growing worse in the city, etc. then a breach was made in the city,&#x201D; (Jeremiah 52:6), but at the destruction of the second <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, the breach was made on the seventeenth day of <italic>Tammuz</italic>, and the destruction of the second <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> affects us more deeply. (Furthermore, it is stated in the Jerusalem Talmud, that even at the destruction of the first <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, the breach was made on the seventeenth, but that because of all the troubles, they made an error in the date). 4) The wicked Apostomos burned a Torah scroll. 5) An idol was placed in the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> by some wicked people among the Jews, and this caused the destruction of the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> and our exile.</p>
<p>5) <bold>The ninth day of <italic>Av</italic></bold> (is a fast day), because on that day the Almighty decreed that our forefathers in the wilderness, would not enter <italic>Eretz Yisrael</italic>, for then the spies had returned (from exploring Canaan), and Yisrael cried in vain, and it was established as a day of weeping for future generations. On that day, the first <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, as well as the second were destroyed, the city of Betar was captured, which was a large city, in which an immense number of Jews lived. On that day, Turnus Rufus plowed the site of the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, and the surrounding area, and, thereby, the verse was fulfilled, &#x201C;Zion shall be plowed into a field&#x201D; (Jeremiah 26:18). (There is another public fast day, the fast of Esther, see Chapter 141:2 below.)</p>
<p>6) If any of these fast days occurs on Shabbos, it is postponed until after Shabbos. When the tenth of <italic>Teiveis</italic> occurs on <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>, we fast that entire day.</p>
<p>7) Should any of these four fast days occur during the bridegroom&#x2019;s seven days of wedding feast, although these days (of the wedding feast) are considered to him as a Yom Tov, nevertheless, he must fast.<sup><xref rid="fn499">1</xref></sup> Since his Yom Tov is only a personal celebration, the public mourning and fasting overrides it, and also, because it is written, &#x201C;&#x2026; if I fail to elevate Jerusalem above my foremost joy&#x201D; (Psalms 137:6).</p>
<p>8) There is a difference between the first three fast days and <italic>Tisha beAv</italic> (the ninth day of Av). On the first three fast days, you are permitted to have food during the preceding night until the break of dawn, if you did not have your regular sleep. If, however, you did have your regular sleep, you are forbidden to eat or drink afterwards, unless you planned to do so before going to sleep. If you usually drink something when getting up from sleep, you need not formulate your plan to have a drink (when getting up). But on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> you must begin the fast on the day before, while it is still day. On the first three fast days, you are permitted to wash, to apply cream, to wear leather shoes, and have marital relations, but on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> all these are forbidden. A pious person, who is in good health, should observe these restrictions on the other fast days, just as on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>, except for the wearing of leather shoes, because people might ridicule him. Concerning marital relations, if it is the night of the immersion in the <italic>mikveh</italic>, he should fulfill his marital obligation on the first three fast days.</p>
<p>9) There is still another lenient feature regarding the first three fasts: pregnant and nursing women, are exempt from fasting, if it causes them discomfort.<sup><xref rid="fn500">2</xref></sup> Also, a sick person, even if he is not critically ill, should not fast.<sup><xref rid="fn501">3</xref></sup> Nevertheless, even a person who is permitted to eat, should not enjoy an elaborate meal, but should eat only as much as he needs to preserve his health. Children, too, although they do not have to fast, nevertheless, if they understand the significance of mourning, it is proper to train them, and give them only bread and water,<sup><xref rid="fn502">4</xref></sup> so that they will be part of the communal mourning.</p>
<p>10) Rinsing your mouth in the morning is forbidden on all public fast days.<sup><xref rid="fn503">5</xref></sup> The saliva should be spit out, if possible. But if you cannot spit it out, you are permitted to swallow it, even on Yom Kippur, since you do not do it for enjoyment. Tasting food, even when spitting it out, is forbidden on a public fast day. But on a fast day, which you undertake voluntarily, you are permitted to taste food and then spit it out. Similarly, rinsing your mouth is permitted on a private fast day.</p>
<p>11) It is a mitzvah, for every Jewish community, when they are beset with trouble, God forbid, to fast and pray to Hashem, blessed is His Name, (for rescue) from their troubles. But if the time is not appropriate for fasting, for instance, if people are fleeing, they are not permitted to fast, lest their strength will be sapped. However they should resolve to fast a certain number of fast days, when they are saved. This will be counted as if they were now fasting, as we find concerning Daniel, about whom it is written, &#x201C;He said to me, &#x2018;Do not be afraid, Daniel; for from the day you resolved to understand and to fast before your God, your words were heard&#x2019;&#x201D; (Daniel 10:12).</p>
<ftnote id="fn499">1. This law also applies when any of these fast days is postponed, as stated in paragraph 6. A groom must fast even on a postponed fast day. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 559:9,35)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn500">2. They are permitted to eat, even if they have no discomfort; except that our women have elected to be stringent and eat only if they experience discomfort. If they are weak, however, they should not practice this stringency, and they should not fast. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 550:5)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn501">3. It is forbidden to practice stringencies in this situation. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 550:4)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn502">4. They may be given any other simple food. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 550:5)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn503">5. According to <italic>Mishnah Berurah,</italic> if you experience discomfort, you are permitted to rinse your mouth, except that you must be careful to bend forward, so that the liquid does not enter the throat. This is even permitted on <italic>Tishah beAv,</italic> if you experience <italic>extreme</italic> discomfort. On Yom Kippur, however, it is proper to be stringent, under all circumstances. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 567:11)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 122 Laws Concerning the Three Weeks between the Seventeenth of Tammuz and Tishah beAv</title>
<p>1) Since the Seventeenth of <italic>Tammuz</italic>, marks the beginning of the anguish of the destruction of the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, it is customary to observe a partial mourning, from that day until after <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>. It is proper for every God-fearing person to recite <italic>Tikun Chatzos</italic> (the special midnight order), daily, in the afternoon. No weddings are performed, even for a person who has not yet fulfilled the mitzvah of <italic>Piryah Verivyah</italic> (&#x201C;Be fertile and have many children.&#x201D;) But engagement parties, even with a meal, are permitted until <italic>Rosh Chodesh Av</italic>. Although it is permissible to make engagements after <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>, nevertheless, it is forbidden to serve a meal (at the engagement party),<sup><xref rid="fn504">1</xref></sup> but it is permitted to serve desserts and other delicacies. A Jew, who makes his living as a professional musician, is permitted to play in the house of a non-Jew, until <italic>Rosh Chodesh Av</italic>, but from <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> until after <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>, he is forbidden to play. On the seventeenth day of <italic>Tammuz</italic>, itself, as well as on the tenth of <italic>Teiveis</italic>. he is also forbidden to play. Some people have the custom not to eat meat, nor to drink wine from the Seventeenth of <italic>Tammuz</italic> until after <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>, except on Shabbos<sup><xref rid="fn505">2</xref></sup> or at a meal that is considered a mitzvah.</p>
<p>2) It is customary not to say the berachah, <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> during these days.<sup><xref rid="fn506">3</xref></sup> Therefore, you should not buy or put on a new garment, since that would make it necessary for you to say the berachah, <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic>. But at the occasion of a <italic>Pidyon haben</italic>, (redemption of the firstborn), <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> must be said, so as not to postpone the fulfillment of the mitzvah. Concerning a new fruit, we are lenient and say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> on Shabbos<sup><xref rid="fn507">4</xref></sup> or even on a weekday,<sup><xref rid="fn508">5</xref></sup> if this fruit will not be available<sup><xref rid="fn509">6</xref></sup> after <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>. Teachers should not strike students, and parents should not strike their children during these days.</p>
<p>3) It is the custom not to have the hair cut during these days, neither the hair of the head, nor of the beard nor of any part of the body. Adults are forbidden to give their children a haircut.</p>
<p>4) It seems to me that it should be permissible to trim the mustache, until the week in which <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> occurs, if it interferes with your eating, but during the week in which <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> occurs, it should be forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn510">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>5) Cuting the nails is forbidden only during the week of <italic>Tishah beAv,<sup><xref rid="fn511">8</xref></sup></italic> but for the purpose of immersion in the <italic>mikveh</italic>, a woman is permitted to cut her nails during that week. Also, a <italic>mohel</italic> is permitted to trim his nails for the requirements of <italic>periah</italic> (removal of the thin membrane).</p>
<p>6) On the three <italic>Shabbosos</italic> between the seventeenth of <italic>Tammuz</italic> and <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>, we read the &#x201C;Three <italic>haftaros</italic> of retribution,&#x201D; which are: <italic>Divrei Yirmiyahu</italic> (The words of Jeremiah) (Jeremiah 1:1), <italic>Shim&#x2019;u devar Hashem</italic>, (Hear the word of Hashem) (Jeremiah 2:4), <italic>Chazon Yeshayahu</italic>, (The vision of Isaiah) (Isaiah 1:1). Their initials form the acronym <italic>DeShaCh</italic>. If, by mistake, the reader recited on the first Shabbos the <italic>haftarah</italic> of the weekly portion, on the second Shabbos, he should read the <italic>haftarah</italic> of both <italic>Divrei Yirmiyahu</italic> and <italic>Shim&#x2019;u</italic>, because they are close to each other. If <italic>Rosh Chodesh Av</italic> occurs on Shabbos, he reads the <italic>haftarah Hashamayim Kis&#x2019;i</italic> (The heaven is My throne) (Isaiah 66), but in some communities, the <italic>haftarah Shim&#x2019;u</italic> is read.</p>
<p>7) When the month of <italic>Av</italic> arrives, we should restrict such activities that create happiness.<sup><xref rid="fn512">9</xref></sup> You should not build a building meant for enjoyment or strictly for relaxation. If you made a contract with a non-Jew, to have your house painted, and you can persuade him for a small compensation, to wait until after <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>, that would be the right thing to do, but if he cannot be persuaded, you may have the work done. If a Jew has a lawsuit against a non-Jew, he should postpone it, because it is an unlucky period. If possible, he should postpone it until after the end of the month, or at least until after <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>. We do not sanctify the new moon until after <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn513">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>8) It is the accepted custom in all Yisrael not to eat meat or drink wine during the nine days, from <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> until after <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn514">11</xref></sup> It is even forbidden to eat food that was cooked with meat or that contains animal fat; even poultry is forbidden. However, a person, who is sensitive to dairy food, is permitted to eat poultry,<sup><xref rid="fn515">12</xref></sup> and for a sick person, all restrictions are lifted.<sup><xref rid="fn516">13</xref></sup> Nevertheless, if it is not too difficult for him, he should abstain from eating (any kind of meat) from the seventh of <italic>Av</italic> on. Also, some women, who have given birth, abstain from meat and wine, from the seventh of <italic>Av</italic> on, for on that day, the heathens entered the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> (See Chapter 124:2 below). At a meal that is considered a mitzvah, such as a <italic>bris</italic> (circumcision), a <italic>pidyon haben</italic> (redemption of the first-born son), or the conclusion of a <italic>Talmud</italic> tractate,<sup><xref rid="fn517">14</xref></sup> it is permitted to eat meat and drink wine. Aside from your parents, brothers and children, and those involved with the mitzvah,<sup><xref rid="fn518">15</xref></sup> you may also invite ten other friends, but only such friends [who, if the meal would have been held] at any other time, would also have joined you. All these mitzvah meals are permitted even on <italic>erev Tishah beAv</italic> before noon, but not later than that. The festive meal, that is usually made on the night before the <italic>bris</italic>, is not considered a mitzvah meal (see 163:8 above). It is forbidden to have meat and wine [at such meals]; rather you should serve dairy food instead. Regarding the cup of wine for <italic>Havdalah</italic> on Shabbos night, if there is a child<sup><xref rid="fn519">16</xref></sup> who is able to drink the greater part of the cup, it should be given to him, otherwise, the person reciting the <italic>Havdalah</italic> may drink it.</p>
<p>9) You should not wash any laundry during the nine days;<sup><xref rid="fn520">17</xref></sup> not even a shirt or a garment that you will not wear until after the fast day. It is forbidden even to have it washed by a non-Jewish washerwoman.<sup><xref rid="fn521">18</xref></sup> A Jewish woman is permitted to wash the clothes of a non-Jew; nevertheless, during the week in which <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> occurs, she should be diligent [not to do this work].<sup><xref rid="fn522">19</xref></sup> During these nine days, it is also forbidden to put on laundered clothing, or to spread linen, even if they were washed before. However in honor of Shabbos, you may put on clean linen garments (undershirts and socks) and spread a fresh tablecloth on the table, and change washcloths and towels, just as you do on other <italic>Shabbosos</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn523">20</xref></sup> But it is forbidden to spread clean sheets. A woman who is required to put on clean white undergarments when she begins to count the seven clean days, is permitted to wash her undergarments, and to put them on. Also diapers, which are dirtied constantly, may be washed.<sup><xref rid="fn524">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>10) During these nine days, you should not have new garments, or new shoes made or socks knitted, even by a non-Jewish craftsman. However if you need them urgently, such as for a wedding that will be held immediately after <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>, you are permitted to use a non-Jewish craftsman, but not a Jew. Before <italic>Rosh Chodesh Av</italic>, you are permitted, in any case, to arrange that clothes or shoes be made, even by a Jewish craftsman, who may make them, even after (<italic>Rosh Chodesh Av</italic>).</p>
<p>11) Women who have the custom not to arrange the threads for weaving, during these nine days because this (the warp), is called in Hebrew <italic>shesi</italic>, and since the destruction of the <italic>Even hashesiyah</italic> (foundation stone) which was in the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, they imposed this stringency on themselves, (mindful of the similarity of <italic>shesi</italic> and <italic>shesiyah</italic>); it is forbidden to let them (arrange the threads).</p>
<p>12) You should not take a bath<sup><xref rid="fn525">22</xref></sup> during these nine days, even in cold water. However for medical reasons, as, for example, when a woman has given birth, or a pregnant woman, close to childbirth, for whom bathing is beneficial, or a weak person, whose physician ordered him to bathe,<sup><xref rid="fn526">23</xref></sup> these are permitted to bathe, even in warm water.<sup><xref rid="fn527">24</xref></sup> A woman, who was menstrually unclean, may bathe and immerse herself in the <italic>mikveh</italic> as usual.<sup><xref rid="fn528">25</xref></sup> If she has to immerse herself on the night after <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>, and it will be impossible for her to take the required bath (on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>), she is permitted to bathe on <italic>erev Tishah beAv</italic>. Similarly, when she puts on clean undergarments, [to begin counting her seven clean days], she is permitted to bathe a little in her accustomed manner because she is not doing it for pleasure.</p>
<p>13) If <italic>Rosh Chodesh Av</italic> occurs on <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>, and you are accustomed to bathe in warm water every <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>, you are permitted to bathe, even in warm water. But on <italic>erev Shabbos Chazon</italic>, it is forbidden to bathe in warm water, even if you usually do so. Only the face, hands and feet (may be washed with warm water).<sup><xref rid="fn529">26</xref></sup> Similarly, if you are accustomed to wash your head every <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>, you are permitted to do so this <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn530">27</xref></sup> but not with soap or a solution of lye. If you are accustomed to immerse yourself in the <italic>mikveh</italic> every <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>, you are permitted to immerse yourself in cold water; but if you omit it occasionally, you are forbidden to do so.</p>
<p>14) A mourner, whose thirtieth day of mourning occurs on the eighteenth day of <italic>Tammuz</italic> or after that, is permitted to take a haircut, until the day before <italic>Rosh Chodesh Av</italic>. But from <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> on, even in such a case, he is forbidden to bathe or to take a haircut.</p>
<p>15) At a <italic>bris</italic> that occurs during the nine days, it is customary for the <italic>mohel</italic>, the <italic>sandak</italic>, and the parents of the infant to wear Shabbos clothing, but the man who brings in the child (<italic>gefatter</italic>) is forbidden to do so. However, the woman who brings in the child customarily wears Shabbos clothes, since this is the only part of the entire mitzvah she can fulfill. They are permitted to have their haircut before <italic>Shabbos Chazon</italic>, but after that, it is forbidden.</p>
<p>16) We wrote in paragraph 9 that on <italic>Shabbos Chazon</italic>, you may put on clean linen garments, that is, undershirts and socks, which (you change) only because of perspiration. But regarding other Shabbos clothing, it depends on the local custom, whether or not you may change to Shabbos clothing. At the synagogue, we change the <italic>paroches</italic> [coverning of the Torah ark], also the table coverings and the mantles, on <italic>Shabbos Chazon;</italic> but not on the Shabbos which occurs on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>.</p>
<p>17) It is customary on <italic>Shabbos Chazon</italic> to call the rabbi, who knows the special mournful chant, for the reading of the <italic>maftir;</italic> thus, he should not be called up (as usual), for the third <italic>aliyah</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn504">1. It is forbidden to make such a special meal, even on Shabbos, since it is in honor of the engagement. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 551:16)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn505">2. On Shabbos, however, it is not permissible to be stringent regarding meat and wine (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 551:59).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn506">3. According to the <italic>Vilna Gaon,</italic> this is an unnecessary stringency. <italic>Taz</italic> is also doubtful about this custom. On Shabbos, therefore, you need not be concerned, and the berachah <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> may be said over a new fruit or on new clothing. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 551:98)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn507">4. See note 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn508">5. According to <italic>Rav Akiva Eiger,</italic> this rule also applies to Rosh Chodesh. (<italic>Shaar Hatzion</italic> 551:98)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn509">6. This refers to a situation where the fruit cannot be kept until Shabbos because of spoilage. If, however, the fruit can be preserved until Shabbos, it is best to do so. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 551:101)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn510">7. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> disagrees and rules that you need not be stringent regarding the mustache, even during the week of <italic>Tishah beAv.</italic> (see <italic>Shaar Hatzion</italic> 551:90)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn511">8. According to <italic>Mishnah Berurah,</italic> you are permitted to cut your nails in honor of Shabbos, even during the week of <italic>Tishah beAv.</italic> (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 551:20)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn512">9. According to <italic>Magein Avrohom,</italic> this implies a total restriction of happiness, and others maintain it implies only a partial restriction (of your usual manner of happiness). (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 551:1 and <italic>Shaar Tzion</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn513">10. Regarding the sanctification of the moon on the night immediately after <italic>Tishah beAv,</italic> see <italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</italic> 97:11 and notes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn514">11. These things are forbidden until after midday of the tenth day of <italic>Av.</italic> (See <italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</italic> 124:20)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn515">12. A sick person is certainly permitted to eat food that was cooked with meat. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 551:64)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn516">13. This applies even to a person who is only slightly ill. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 551:61)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn517">14. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> cautions against deliberately hurrying or delaying the conclusion of a <italic>Talmud</italic> tractate, in order to eat meat in the nine days. He maintains this rule is valid, only when the Tractate is concluded under normal circumstances. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 551:73)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn518">15. The <italic>Sandek,</italic> and the couple who bring in the child are included in those &#x201C;involved in the mitzvah.&#x201D; (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 551, <italic>Shaar Hatzion</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn519">16. This applies to a child who is of age so far as <italic>chinuch</italic> is concerned, (six or seven years old) but, nevertheless, who has not reached the age to understand the mourning over the destruction of Jerusalem. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 551:70)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn520">17. See note 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn521">18. If you must leave on a distant journey during the week of <italic>Tisha beAv,</italic> it is permitted to have the clothes needed for the trip laundered by a non-Jew. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 551:39)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn522">19. In a situation where there is a question of providing food for her family, this would be permitted. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 551:42)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn523">20. The <italic>Vilna Gaon</italic> permitted the wearing of regular Shabbos clothing on the Shabbos before <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>. <italic>Rav Yaakov Emden</italic> permitted wearing Shabbos clothing, even when <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> occured on Shabbos and was postponed until Sunday. (See <italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch,</italic> paragraph 16) (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 551:6)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn524">21. Other types of infants&#x2019; and children&#x2019;s clothing may also be washed. You should, however, not wash a large amount of clothes at one time. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 551:82,83)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn525">22. Washing of the face, hands and feet is permitted. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 551:94)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn526">23. Only if he was ordered to bathe daily in hot water. (<italic>Shaar Hatzion</italic> 551:94)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn527">24. On <italic>Tishah beAv,</italic> itself, however, he should refrain from doing so. (<italic>Ibid</italic>.)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn528">25. Even with hot water. (see <italic>Biyur Halachah</italic> 551:16)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn529">26. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 551:97.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn530">27. This, too, is permitted, only if you do so every <italic>erev</italic> Shabbos. This may be done with hot water, if you are accustomed to do so. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 551:97)</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Chapter 123 Laws Concerning Erev Tishah beAv</title>
<p>1) When a <italic>bris</italic> or a <italic>pidyon haben</italic> occur on <italic>erev Tishah beAv</italic>, the festive meal should be held before noon.</p>
<p>2) You should not go for a walk on <italic>erev Tishah beAv;</italic> and in the afternoon, it is the custom to study only the subjects you are permitted to study on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn531">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) Concerning the final meal before the fast, there are many laws. The correct custom is to eat a regular meal before the <italic>Minchah</italic> service. After that, you pray <italic>Minchah</italic>, omitting <italic>Tachanun</italic>, because <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> is called a <italic>Moed</italic> as it is written, &#x201C;He has proclaimed a <italic>Moed</italic> for me&#x201D; (Lamentations 1:15). Towards evening, you should sit on the floor<sup><xref rid="fn532">2</xref></sup> but it is not necessary to take off your shoes. Three people should not sit down (to eat) together, so that they will not be required (to recite <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>) with <italic>zimun</italic>. You should eat only bread and a cold hard-boiled egg.<sup><xref rid="fn533">3</xref></sup> You should dip a small piece of bread in ashes and eat it.<sup><xref rid="fn534">4</xref></sup> You should be careful to finish the meal while it is still day. (Whether you are permitted to eat after this, see 131:12 below).</p>
<p>4) If a person fasts throughout the year on Mondays and Thursdays, and <italic>erev Tishah beAv</italic> occurs on either of these days, he should have his vow annulled. If someone observes <italic>Yahrtzeit</italic> on <italic>erev Tishah beAv</italic>, he should resolve on the first <italic>Yahrtzeit</italic>, to fast only until noon has passed, then he should pray <italic>Minchah gedolah</italic> (early <italic>Minchah</italic>), that is, half-an-hour past noon, eat a meal, and afterwards towards evening, he should eat the final meal.</p>
<p>5) During twilight, you are forbidden to do all that is forbidden on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>. You must, therefore, take off your shoes before twilight.</p>
<ftnote id="fn531">1. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> cites other opinions who maintain that this custom is an extraordinary stringency, and concludes that we need not protest if someone maintains his usual course of studies, even on <italic>erev Tishah beAv.</italic> He cites the opinions of <italic>Rashal, Vilna Gaon, Chayei Adam,</italic> who permitted regular study of all subjects. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 553:8)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn532">2. A weak person is permitted to place a cushion or mat on the floor to sit on after concluding this meal. It is permitted to sit on a regular chair until nightfall. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 552:18)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn533">3. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> does not mention that the egg must be cold.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn534">4. Before eating it, you may say, &#x201C;This is the meal of <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>.&#x201D; (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 552:16)</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Chapter 124 Laws of Tishah beAv</title>
<p>1) In the evening, upon entering the synagogue, you should remove your shoes<sup><xref rid="fn535">1</xref></sup> (as we have written at the conclusion of the previous chapter). It is customary to remove the covering of the Torah Ark, because it is written, &#x201C;He has carried out His word&#x201D; (Lamentations 2:17) (for explanation, see 124:3 below) and to have only one light in front of the <italic>Chazzan</italic>. We pray <italic>Maariv</italic> in a low and tearful voice, like mourners. We do not say <italic>Nacheim</italic> (comfort) until the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic> of <italic>Minchah</italic> of the next day. After the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>, the <italic>Chazzan</italic> says the whole <italic>Kaddish</italic> including <italic>tiskabbeil</italic>, and everyone sits on the floor. Then a few lights are lit, sufficient for the congregation to say <italic>Eichah</italic> (Lamentations) and <italic>Kinnos</italic>. <italic>Eichah</italic> and <italic>kinnos</italic> are also recited in a low, tearful voice. When saying <italic>Eichah</italic>, a short pause should be made between one verse and the other, and a slightly longer pause between one chapter and the other. At the beginning of each chapter of <italic>Eichah</italic>, the <italic>Chazzan</italic> raises his voice a little more. The last verse of each chapter should be said in a loud voice, and when he reaches the verse <italic>Hashiveinu</italic> etc. (Bring us back), the congregation recites it aloud. The <italic>Chazzan</italic> then concludes the reading, and the congregation repeats <italic>Hashiveinu</italic> etc. aloud, and the <italic>Chazzan</italic> does the same. After that, <italic>Ve&#x2019;atah kadosh</italic> (You are the Holy One) is recited by the congregation and the complete <italic>Kaddish</italic> without <italic>tiskabbeil</italic> is said by the <italic>Chazan</italic>, since it says in <italic>Eichah</italic>, &#x201C;He shuts out My prayer&#x201D; (Lamentations 3:8). The next morning at <italic>Shacharis, tiskabbeil</italic> is again omitted in the <italic>Kaddish</italic>. It is not said until <italic>Minchah</italic>. A person who prays by himself, because he can find no <italic>minyan</italic> (quorum of ten males thirteen years and older), should also recite <italic>Eichah</italic> and <italic>Kinnos</italic>.</p>
<p>2) You should express grief in the manner of your sleeping. For example, if you are accustomed to sleep on two pillows, you should sleep only on one. Some people have the custom to sleep on the floor during the night of <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>, and to put a stone underneath their head as a reminder of what was said, &#x201C;And he took some of the stones of the place etc.,&#x201D; (Genesis 28:11). Our Sages comment that Jacob foresaw the destruction of the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> and said, &#x201C;How frightful&#x201D; etc. (verse 17). It all depends on the person&#x2019;s attitude.<sup><xref rid="fn536">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) In the morning, we do not put on the <italic>tefillin</italic>, because <italic>tefillin</italic> are called an &#x201C;ornament.&#x201D; Neither do we put on the large <italic>tallis</italic>, because it is written, &#x201C;<italic>Bitza imraso</italic>&#x201D; (Lamentations 2:17), and the <italic>Targum</italic> translates, &#x201C;He tore his purple cloak apart.&#x201D; But you should put on your <italic>tallis katan</italic> (small <italic>tallis</italic>) without saying a berachah.<sup><xref rid="fn537">3</xref></sup> You should go to the synagogue a bit earlier than usual.<sup><xref rid="fn538">4</xref></sup> No light should be lit for the prayers.<sup><xref rid="fn539">5</xref></sup> Again, prayers should be said in a low and tearful voice. We do say <italic>Mizmor Lesodah</italic> (a Psalm of thanksgiving). In the repetition of the <italic>Shemoneh esrei</italic> the <italic>Chazzan</italic> says <italic>Aneinu</italic> (Answer us) between <italic>Ga&#x2019;al Yisrael</italic> (the Redeemer of Israel) and <italic>Refa&#x2019;einu</italic> (Heal us), as on every other public fast day. He does not say the <italic>Birkas kohanim</italic> (priestly blessing).<sup><xref rid="fn540">6</xref></sup> After the <italic>Shemoneh esrei</italic>, he says half-<italic>kaddish</italic>. We do not say <italic>Tachanun</italic> or <italic>Keil erech apayim</italic> (O&#x2019; God, slow to anger), because <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> is called a <italic>moed</italic>. A <italic>Seifer</italic> Torah is taken out and the section <italic>Ki solid banim</italic> etc. is read (When you will have children) etc. (Deuteronomy 4:25), is read for three persons. It is proper for the one called up, to say quietly, <italic>Baruch dayan ha&#x2019;emes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn541">7</xref></sup> (Blessed is the true Judge) before saying the berachah. After the reading of the Torah, half-<italic>kaddish</italic> is said, and the <italic>haftarah</italic> is read of the chapter, <italic>Asof asifeim</italic>, [I will destroy them completely] (Jeremiah 8:13) in the tone of <italic>Eichah</italic>. The <italic>Seifer</italic> Torah is then replaced in the Ark. Everyone is seated on the floor to say <italic>Kinnos</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn542">8</xref></sup> The saying of <italic>kinnos</italic> should be drawn out, until close to noon. Then <italic>Ashrei</italic> (Fortunate are those) is said omitting <italic>Lamenatzei&#x2019;ach</italic>, (For the conductor), and we say <italic>Uva letziyon go&#x2019;eil</italic> [A redeemer shall come to Zion] etc., but we omit the verse <italic>Va&#x2019;ani zos berisi</italic> [And as for Me, this is My covenant], for it would appear, as if He established a covenant for the <italic>Kinnos</italic>, and, besides, it would be inappropriate to say <italic>Va&#x2019;ani zos berisi etc., Lo yamushu mipicha etc</italic>. (My words shall not depart from your mouth), since no one is studying Torah, as Torah study is forbidden (on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>). But at a mourner&#x2019;s house, during the entire year, except on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>, the verse should be said, for, although the mourner is not studying Torah, those that come to console him are not exempt [from Torah study]. Then, <italic>Ve&#x2019;atah kadosh</italic> is said (And You are the Holy One) etc., followed by the complete <italic>kaddish</italic>, omitting <italic>tiskabbeil</italic>, then <italic>Aleinu</italic> (It is our duty) is said, and the mourner&#x2019;s <italic>kaddish</italic>. We do not say <italic>Shir hayichud</italic> (Song of God&#x2019;s Unity), nor <italic>Shir shel yom</italic> (Song of the day), nor <italic>Pittum haketores</italic> (The incense mixture). It is proper for everyone to read <italic>Eichah</italic> afterwards</p>
<p>4) If there is a mourner in the town, he should go to the synagogue on the night (of <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>) and also during the day,<sup><xref rid="fn543">9</xref></sup> (and stay) until the conclusion of the <italic>Kinnos</italic>. He is permitted to receive an <italic>aliyah</italic> and to read the <italic>haftarah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn544">10</xref></sup> because we all are mourners (on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>).</p>
<p>5) The words of the Torah gladden the heart, as it is said, &#x201C;The precepts of Hashem are upright, gladdening the heart&#x201D; (Psalms 19:9). Therefore, it is forbidden to study Torah on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>, except for subjects that sadden the heart, such as the chapters of the book of Jeremiah,<sup><xref rid="fn545">11</xref></sup> regarding the ominous events he prophesied, omitting the verses of consolation. Also the verses foretelling the punishment to be meted out to the nations of the world that are written there, should be omitted. It is also permitted to study the Book of Job, as well as <italic>Midrash Eichah</italic>. [The following Talmudic selections may also be studied:] the Talmud, chapter <italic>Eilu megalchin</italic>, (Moed Katan, 3rd chapter), which deals with the laws of a mourner, and a person who was excommunicated, and the <italic>Aggadic</italic> portion of the chapter <italic>Hanizakin</italic> (<italic>Maseches Gittin</italic> 55b), and in the Jerusalem Talmud, the last part of the <italic>Maseches Ta&#x2019;anis</italic>, which discusses the destruction of the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>. But even the chapters you are permitted to study, you are forbidden to study in depth, to find an answer to a difficult question or a homiletic interpretation, for that would gladden the heart. Any subject you, yourself, are permitted to study, you are permitted to teach to children. You are permitted to read the entire order of daily prayers, even the <italic>Mishnah</italic> of <italic>Eizehu mekoman</italic><sup><xref rid="fn546">12</xref></sup> (What is the location [of the offerings?]). But you should not say <italic>Ma&#x2019;amados</italic>, even if you are accustomed to saying it every day.</p>
<p>6) Even if pregnant and nursing women suffer very much, they are required to complete the fast, unless, God forbid, this might endanger their health. However, a sick person, even if his condition is not critical, should be lenient, and should not complete the fast, but fast only for a few hours.<sup><xref rid="fn547">13</xref></sup> This is especially true if he is weak by nature. A woman, from the seventh until the thirtieth day after giving birth, is governed by the same <italic>halachah</italic> that applies to a sick person, whose condition is not critical, even though she is not really sick. However, if she feels that she is in perfect health and the fast will not harm her, she should complete the fast. Those who must eat on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> should not enjoy an elaborate meal, but should eat no more than they need to preserve their health.</p>
<p>7) You are forbidden to wash yourself, whether in hot or cold water. Even dipping your fingers in water is forbidden. But only washing for pleasure is forbidden, however, when it is not for pleasure, it is permitted. You may, therefore, wash your hands in the morning. But you should be careful to wash only your fingers, for this constitutes the mitzvah of washing in the morning,<sup><xref rid="fn548">14</xref></sup> to remove the evil spirit, that rests on the fingers. After you dry your hands a little, while they are still slightly damp, you may pass them over your eyes.<sup><xref rid="fn549">15</xref></sup> If your eyes are sticky and you usually wash them in the morning, you may wash them now also, as usual, and you need not be concerned about it.<sup><xref rid="fn550">16</xref></sup> Similarly, if your hands are soiled with mud or other dirt, you may wash the dirty spots. After going to the bathroom, you may wash your hands lightly in the usual manner.<sup><xref rid="fn551">17</xref></sup> Also, for the <italic>Minchah</italic> service, you should wash your fingers.</p>
<p>8) Women who need to rinse the foods used in cooking, are permitted to do so, because their purpose is not to wash their hands. If you are on your way to perform a mitzvah, and the only way you can get there is by crossing a stream, you may cross it on your way there and on returning, and you need not be concerned about it. However, if you are going for business, you may cross it on your way going, but on your return trip it is forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn552">18</xref></sup> If you return from the road and your feet feel weak, you may bathe them in water.<sup><xref rid="fn553">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>9) Although only bathing for pleasure is forbidden, nevertheless, a woman whose time for <italic>tevilah</italic> (immersion) occurs on the night of <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> should not do the <italic>tevilah</italic>, since marital relations are forbidden (on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>). (Regarding the putting on of white undergarments, see chapter 159 below).</p>
<p>10) Applying cream, too, is forbidden only, if it is done for pleasure.<sup><xref rid="fn554">20</xref></sup> But a person who has pimples or needs it for any other medical treatment, may apply cream or ointment.</p>
<p>11) Wearing shoes is forbidden only, if they are made of leather. Shoes made of cloth or similar material, which do not have leather soles,<sup><xref rid="fn555">21</xref></sup> may be worn. People who have to walk among non-Jews, as a rule wear leather shoes, in order not to be ridiculed, but they should put some earth in their shoes.<sup><xref rid="fn556">22</xref></sup> Nevertheless, a pious person should observe the law stringently. Storekeepers are surely forbidden to wear leather shoes. Our Sages, of blessed memory, ruled that since it is very exhausting, a person who has to go a long distance on foot is permitted to wear leather shoes.<sup><xref rid="fn557">23</xref></sup> But when he approaches a city, he must take them off. But a person riding in a vehicle is forbidden to wear leather shoes.</p>
<p>12) It is forbidden to have marital relations. One should be strict about this, and not even touch his wife.</p>
<p>13) You are forbidden to greet your neighbor on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>, even to say &#x201C;good morning,&#x201D; or any similar greeting. If an unlearned person or a non-Jew says hello to you, you may answer in a low voice, for otherwise, they would be angry with you. It is also forbidden to send a gift to your neighbor, because this is a form of greeting.</p>
<p>14) You should not stroll in public places, in order to avoid laughter and frivolity. Some authorities forbid smoking the entire day, while others permit it in the afternoon, in the privacy of the home.</p>
<p>15) It is our custom, that any work requiring time, even work for which no skill is required, is forbidden the night (of <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>), and in the daytime, until noon. But work that does not take long to do, like lighting candles or tying a knot, is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn558">24</xref></sup> In the afternoon, all work is permitted. It is also the custom to forbid doing business before noon, but to permit in the afternoon.<sup><xref rid="fn559">25</xref></sup> However, a God-fearing man should be stringent in his observance the entire day, and not do any work, nor do any business, so that his mind should not be distracted from mourning.<sup><xref rid="fn560">26</xref></sup> It is permitted, however, to instruct a non-Jew to do any kind of work for you.<sup><xref rid="fn561">27</xref></sup> Any work, that if not done, would entail a loss, you are permitted to do yourself. Milking the cows preferably should be done by a non-Jew, but when that is impossible, you are permitted to do it yourself.</p>
<p>16) It is the custom not to sit on a bench (or chair), either at night, or in the day until the afternoon; but to sit only on the floor.<sup><xref rid="fn562">28</xref></sup> In the afternoon, it is permitted. However, the other things that are forbidden, are forbidden until the stars appear.</p>
<p>17) It is customary not to start preparing the meal before noon, but (if the meal is) for the purpose of a mitzvah, it is permitted.</p>
<p>18) If there is to be a <italic>bris</italic>, the <italic>bris</italic> should be performed after the saying of the <italic>Kinnos</italic> has ended. The father and the mother (of the infant), the <italic>sandak</italic> and the <italic>mohel</italic>, may put on their Shabbos clothes in honor of the <italic>bris</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn563">29</xref></sup> After the <italic>bris</italic>, they should take them off. Candles should be lit in honor of the <italic>bris</italic>, and the cup of wine is given to a child to drink.</p>
<p>19) At the <italic>Minchah</italic> service, we put on the <italic>tallis</italic> and the <italic>tefillin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn564">30</xref></sup> saying the berachah over them.<sup><xref rid="fn565">31</xref></sup> The <italic>Shir shel yom</italic> (Song of the day) is said, as well as the other things that were omitted in the <italic>Shacharis</italic> service.<sup><xref rid="fn566">32</xref></sup> Then <italic>Ashrei</italic> and half- <italic>kaddish</italic> are said. We read the Torah and the <italic>maftir</italic>, as on any other public fast day. Then the <italic>seifer</italic> Torah is replaced in the Ark and the <italic>Chazzan</italic> says half- <italic>kaddish</italic>, after which the <italic>Shemoneh esreih</italic> is said. We insert <italic>Nacheim</italic> (Console, O God) in the berachah <italic>Velirushalayim</italic> (And to Jerusalem). If you forgot to say it there, you should say it after <italic>Aneinu</italic> (Answer us),<sup><xref rid="fn567">33</xref></sup> but you should not conclude the prayer, with <italic>Baruch menacheim</italic> [Blessed &#x2026; Consoler] etc., but with <italic>Ki atah shomei&#x2019;a</italic> (For You hear the prayers) etc. But if you did not realize it until after you said <italic>Baruch atah Hashem</italic> [Blessed are You, Hashem], you conclude the berachah <italic>Shomei&#x2019;a tefillah</italic> [Who hears prayer]<sup><xref rid="fn568">34</xref></sup> and continue praying according to the regular order, and you do not have to repeat [the <italic>Shemoneh esrei</italic>]. The <italic>Chazzan</italic>, in the repetition of the <italic>Shemoneh esrei</italic>, recites the <italic>Birkas kohanim</italic> (Priestly Blessing). After the <italic>Shemoneh esrei</italic>, he says the whole <italic>kaddish</italic> with <italic>tiskabbeil</italic>. We then take off the <italic>tefillin</italic> and pray <italic>Maariv</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn569">35</xref></sup> If the moon is shining, we recite <italic>Kiddush levanah</italic> (Sanctification of the moon).<sup><xref rid="fn570">36</xref></sup> See 97:11 above, where it is stated that you must taste some food first.<sup><xref rid="fn571">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>20) We are taught in a <italic>Beraisa</italic>, &#x201C;On the seventh day of Av, the heathens entered the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>. They ate and drank and wreaked havoc in it on the seventh and eighth days, and on the ninth, towards evening, they set fire to the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, and it continued to burn throughout the tenth day until sunset. The reason the fast was not set for the tenth day, although the greater part of the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> was burned on that day, is because the beginning of a punishment is felt more severly. In the Jerusalem Talmud it is stated, &#x201C;Rabbi Avin fasted on the ninth and on the tenth,&#x201D; ( <italic>Maseches Taanis</italic> 4:6). Rabbi Levi fasted on the ninth and on the night of the tenth. Because he did not have the strength to fast the entire tenth day, he fasted during the night only. But as for us, since our strength has waned, we fast only on the ninth, but we impose a stringency on ourselves, in that we do not eat meat, nor do we drink wine, during the night of the tenth day, nor on the tenth day until noon, unless it is at a meal that is considered a mitzvah. Also, the berachah <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> should not be said; neither should you take a bath, or a haircut, or wash clothes, until noon of the tenth day. A person who imposes upon himself to observe all the above-mentioned restrictions for the entire tenth day of <italic>Av</italic>, is to be praised.<sup><xref rid="fn572">38</xref></sup> If the tenth of <italic>Av</italic> occurs on <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>, you may bathe, take a haircut and wash immediately in the morning, in honor of the Shabbos.</p>
<p>21) A woman who has given birth, although she fasts after seven days [after giving birth], is permitted, on the night of the tenth, to eat meat and drink wine.</p>
<p>22) It is proper not to have marital relations on the night of the tenth, unless it is on the night of her <italic>tevilah</italic> (immersion), or if he is going on a trip, or returned from a trip.</p>
<ftnote id="fn535">1. <italic>Maharil</italic> writes that shoes should be removed before leaving the house to go to the synagogue. (See <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 553:5)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn536">2. A pregnant woman or any weak (or sick) person is not obligated to do any of these things. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 555:7)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn537">3. If you removed your <italic>tallis katan</italic> at night, some maintain that you should say a berachah when you put it on in the morning. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 555:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn538">4. If starting <italic>Shacharis</italic> early will cause the congregation to conclude saying <italic>Kinnos</italic> much before midday, it is better not to start too early. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 559:16)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn539">5. At <italic>Minchah,</italic> however, lights may be lit. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 559:15)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn540">6. This rule is not mentioned in <italic>Mishnah Berurah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn541">7. This custom is also not mentioned in <italic>Mishnah Berurah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn542">8. During the saying of <italic>Kinnos,</italic> it is forbidden to walk out of the synagogue or to engage in conversation which interrupt your thoughts and feelings of mourning the destruction. Light-headedness is always forbidden in the synagogue, and certainly so on <italic>Tishah beAv,</italic> a day of mourning over the destruction and the consequent exile of our people. (See <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 559:22)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn543">9. Other <italic>Poskim</italic> maintain that during the first three days of mourning, he should not go to the synagogue. <italic>Rav Shlomo Kluger</italic> ruled that he should not go at night, when only a limited <italic>Kinnos</italic> is said, but by day, when the majority of <italic>Kinnos</italic> is said, he is permitted to go. After the three days, however, he may go, even at night. (See <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 559:24 and also <italic>Shaar Hatzion</italic> 22)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn544">10. This rule is not mentioned in <italic>Mishnah Berurah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn545">11. According to <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 554:2, it is also permitted to study commentaries on <italic>Jeremiah</italic> and <italic>Job.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn546">12. The portion of prayers that deal with the order of sacrificial offerings should not be said, with the exception of the daily sacrifice. (See <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 554:7)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn547">13. If this, too, is difficult for him, he need not fast at all. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 554:14)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn548">14. The berachah <italic>al netilas yadayim</italic> (over washing the hands) should not be said, until after you have gone to the bathroom and washed your hands. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 554:21)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn549">15. You may also pass them over your face and hands as well. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 554:22)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn550">16. This is similar to removing mud or other dirt, which you are permitted to wash, as mentioned in the following <italic>halachah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn551">17. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> rules that you may wash your hands, only till the knuckles (i.e. the fingers only). (613:6)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn552">18. You are permitted to go because it may involve monetary loss, but there is no reason to permit the return. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 554:25) (The return trip is permitted, when you go to do a mitzvah because you might hesitate to go, knowing that you cannot return, but this consideration will not prevent you from going, if it means financial gain or the prevention of a loss.)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn553">19. This is not considered pleasure, but, rather, for health reasons. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 554:26)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn554">20. It is, however, permitted to apply cream etc., in order to remove perspiration. (see <italic>Biyur Halachah</italic> 554:15)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn555">21. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> rules that if the upper shoe is leather, they are forbidden, even if the soles are wooden. Similarly, if the soles are made of cloth and the upper shoe is leather, it, too, is forbidden. (554:31)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn556">22. This <italic>halachah</italic> is not mentioned in <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> in this context. See, however, following note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn557">23. In this situation, you should put some earth in your shoes. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 554:33)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn558">24. Regarding writing, <italic>Eliyahu Rabbah,</italic> in the name of <italic>Knesseth Hagedolah,</italic> says that you may be lenient; and <italic>Mateh Yehudah</italic> says that writing on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> is governed by the same rules as on <italic>Chol haMoed.</italic> (see <italic>Biyur Halachah</italic> 554:22)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn559">25. However, it is best not to get involved in your business, to the extent that you will forget that it is a day of mourning. This also applies to working. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 554:49)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn560">26. <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 554:24 rules that one who does work on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> will not see any blessing from that work. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> explains that he will not see blessing from the profit made from working on <italic>Tishah beAv.</italic> See note 25, that this refers only in a situation where he completely forgot that it is a day of mourning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn561">27. This does not include building or exterior work that is in the public view which is forbidden. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 554:46)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn562">28. You are permitted, however, to sit on a mat or pillow. You may also sit on a low stool, if you find it difficult to sit on the floor. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 559:11)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn563">29. Nevertheless, they are forbidden to wear leather shoes. (<italic>Biyur Halachah</italic> 559:8)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn564">30. Those who also put on the <italic>tefillin</italic> of <italic>Rabeinu Tam</italic> should put them on at this time. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 555:4)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn565">31. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> rules that you should not say <italic>Kerias Shemah,</italic> or the Chapter <italic>kadeish,</italic> which is usually said when putting on <italic>tefillin,</italic> because at <italic>Minchah</italic> time, this would merely constitute the reading of Torah chapters, which is forbidden on <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 555:5)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn566">32. Although some have the custom to recite <italic>tehillim</italic> (Psalms) in the afternoon, <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> indicates that it is best not to do so, citing the custom of Posen to recite on the following day, the portion of <italic>tehillim,</italic> which ordinarily would have been said, had it not been <italic>Tishah beAv,</italic> in addition to the regular portion of the day. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> also maintains that the passage of <italic>Pitum haKetoras,</italic> which deals with the compounding of the incense-offering, as well as other passage dealing with sacrificial-offering, should not be said even at <italic>Minchah</italic>. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 554:7) (The Psalm <italic>Lamenatzei&#x2019;ach,</italic> the verses of <italic>Uva Letzion go&#x2019;eil,</italic> that were omitted at <italic>Shacharis</italic> (see paragraph 3) are not to be said at <italic>Minchah,</italic> and <italic>tachanun</italic> is also not said at <italic>Minchah.</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn567">33. <italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</italic>&#x2019;s ruling is based on <italic>Taz,</italic> which <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> says is only a singular opinion, citing other Poskim, who refute <italic>Taz.</italic> The proper way, according to <italic>Mishnah Berurah,</italic> based on <italic>Mateh Yehudah</italic> is to say insert <italic>Nacheim</italic> before saying <italic>Vesechezenu</italic> (And may our eyes behold) and to conclude with <italic>Vesechezenu,</italic> until its concluding berachah. (see <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 557:2; also <italic>Biyur Halachah</italic> 557:1)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 125 Laws of Tishah beAv When it Occurs on Shabbos or on Sunday</title>
<p>1) If <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> occurs on Sunday, or if it occurs on Shabbos and is deferred to Sunday, you may eat meat and drink wine on Shabbos.<sup><xref rid="fn573">1</xref></sup> Even at the third meal, after <italic>Minchah</italic>, you may eat everything<sup><xref rid="fn574">2</xref></sup> but you should not have this meal in the company of friends.<sup><xref rid="fn575">3</xref></sup> If a <italic>bris</italic> is to be held, the meal should be served before <italic>Minchah</italic>. But you are permitted to eat the third meal with your family, and you may say <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> with <italic>zimun</italic>. You must finish the meal, while it is still daytime,<sup><xref rid="fn576">4</xref></sup> because at twilight you are forbidden to eat, drink or wash. However, you should not take off your shoes until after <italic>Barechu</italic> is said. The Chazzan takes off his shoes before saying <italic>Vehu Rachum</italic> [He, the Merciful One], so that he should not get confused; but before [taking off his shoes] he should say: <italic>Baruch hamavdil bein kodesh lechol</italic> [Blessed is He Who separates between the holy and the secular], without mentioning Hashem&#x2019;s Name and Kingship [<italic>Hashem Elokeinu melech haolam</italic>].</p>
<p>2) If Friday night is the night of <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>, it is forbidden to have marital relations, unless it is the night of her <italic>tevilah</italic> [immersion].</p>
<p>3) We say <italic>Av harachamim</italic> [Father of compassion], and we say memorial prayers in <italic>Shacharis</italic>, but in <italic>Minchah</italic>, we do not say <italic>Tzidkasecha tzedek</italic> [Your righteousness is everlasting].</p>
<p>4) If <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> occurs on Shabbos, you should be stringent and study only those subjects that you are allowed to study on <italic>Tishah beAv;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn577">5</xref></sup> therefore, we do not say <italic>Pirkei Avos</italic>. Reading the <italic>sidrah</italic> of the week twice and the <italic>Targum</italic> once, is permitted, before noon. If <italic>erev Tishah beAv</italic> occurs on Shabbos, it is forbidden to study in the afternoon, as on any other <italic>erev Tishah beAv</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn578">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>5) Before <italic>Maariv</italic>, we do not say <italic>Lamenatzei&#x2019;ach bineginos</italic>, neither do we say <italic>Vihi no&#x2019;am</italic> before <italic>Ve&#x2019;atah Kadosh</italic>, for this was composed for the setting up of the <italic>Mishkan</italic> [Tabernacle] and now it is destroyed. Neither do we say <italic>Veyitein lecha</italic> (May Hashem grant you), nor do parents bless their children.</p>
<p>6) At dark, when you see the candlelight, you should say the berachah <italic>Borei me&#x2019;orei ha&#x2019;eish</italic><sup><xref rid="fn579">7</xref></sup> [Who creates the lights of fire], and in the <italic>Shemoneh esrei</italic> we say: <italic>Ata chonantanu</italic> [You have favored us.] We do not say <italic>Havdalah</italic> over the cup of wine until the conclusion of <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn580">8</xref></sup> But you should not say the berachah over the spices and over the light, even if you failed to say (the berachah over the light) on Shabbos night. You should caution your family not to do do any work before they say <italic>Hamavdil bein kodesh lechol</italic> [Who separates between the holy and the secular] without mentioning Hashem&#x2019;s Name and Kingship. If you forget to say <italic>Ata chonantanu</italic>, you need not repeat [the <italic>Shemoneh esrei</italic>], but you should finish the <italic>Shemoneh esrei</italic>, (as stated in Chapter 96, above), because you will say <italic>Havdalah</italic> over wine at the end of <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>. You should not taste any food before <italic>Havdalah</italic>, and if you find it necessary to do some work, you should first say: <italic>Hamavdil bein kodesh</italic> etc., without mentioning Hashem&#x2019;s Name and Kingship.</p>
<p>7) When <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> occurs on Shabbos, and it is deferred to Sunday, it is forbidden to eat meat or drink wine<sup><xref rid="fn581">9</xref></sup> on the night after the fast as it is on any other <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>, because of the mourning observed on that day. On the following morning, everything is permitted.</p>
<p>8) If a <italic>bris</italic> is to be held on a deferred <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>, it is permitted for the main participants, i.e. the father and mother of the infant, the <italic>mohel</italic> and the <italic>sandak</italic> to pray the <italic>Minchah gedolah</italic>, that is one half hour past midday. They may then recite the <italic>Havdalah</italic> over wine<sup><xref rid="fn582">10</xref></sup> and eat and wash, but they should not have the festive meal until the night. Similarly, when a <italic>pidyon haben</italic> is held, that has not been postponed, the father and the <italic>kohen</italic> should not complete the fast.</p>
<ftnote id="fn573">1. It is forbidden to refrain from eating meat on Shabbos, because of mourning. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 552:23)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn574">2. It is said in <italic>Shulchan Aruch,</italic> that you are permitted to serve at this meal, even like the royal feast of King Solomon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn575">3. <italic>Bechor Shor</italic> disagrees. He rules that if you are accustomed to eat in the company of friends every Shabbos, you may do so on this Shabbos as well, because, otherwise, it would be considered mourning in public, which is forbidden on Shabbos. (<italic>Ibid.</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn576">4. I.e. before sunset. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 552:24)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn577">5. This applies only after midday, but before that, it is permitted to study whatever you usually study. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> cites <italic>Taz,</italic> who says that we can rely on his opinion, since many other <italic>Poskim</italic> are lenient and permit Torah study after midday, even on a weekday.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn578">6. See note 5. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 553:9,10)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn579">7. This should be done, preferably before the reading of <italic>Eichah</italic>. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 556:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn580">8. You, yourself, are permitted to drink the wine, and you need not give it to a child. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 556:3) The introductory sentences beginnng with <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05B4;&#x05E0;&#x05B5;&#x05D4; &#x05E7;&#x05B5;&#x05DC;</span> should not be said.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn581">9. All <italic>Poskim</italic> agree, however, that it is permitted to take a haircut or shave.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn582">10. The introductory sentences beginning with <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05B4;&#x05E0;&#x05B5;&#x05D4; &#x05E7;&#x05B5;&#x05DC;</span> should not be said.</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 126 Commemorating the Destruction of the Beis Hamikdash</title>
<p>1) After the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> was destroyed, our Sages, of blessed memory, ordained that on every joyous occasion, there should be a remembrance of the destruction of the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, as it is written: &#x201C;If I forget you, Jerusalem, if I fail to elevate Jerusalem above my foremost joy&#x201D; (Psalms 137:5). They decreed that no Jew should build a house<sup><xref rid="fn583">1</xref></sup> for himself that is lime-plastered and decorated like a royal palace.<sup><xref rid="fn584">2</xref></sup> Neither should he lime plaster his entire house, but he may plaster the house,<sup><xref rid="fn585">3</xref></sup> with clay and then lime plaster, it (lit. whitewash it), and he should leave a space of one square <italic>amah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn586">4</xref></sup> opposite the entrance<sup><xref rid="fn587">5</xref></sup> unplastered,<sup><xref rid="fn588">6</xref></sup> as a reminder of the destruction [of the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>. ] We do not know of any good reason why people do not observe this custom nowadays.</p>
<p>2) They also ordained that if you are setting a table, and are having guests for a meal, even for a meal that is considered a mitzvah, you should not serve all the dishes that are conventionally served at a meal.<sup><xref rid="fn589">7</xref></sup> They also ordained that a woman should not wear all her jewelry at one occasion,<sup><xref rid="fn590">8</xref></sup> and that a bridegroom before the <italic>chuppah</italic> [wedding ceremony], should have ashes put on his head on the place where the <italic>tefillin</italic> are worn, and the veil, with which the bride is covered, should not contain any silver or gold threads. It is also customary, that after the <italic>tenaim</italic> [engagement agreement] has been read to break a plate, as a reminder of the destruction of the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, but a damaged plate is used (for that purpose). Under the <italic>chuppah</italic> the bridegroom breaks a glass, and for this purpose, a whole glass may be used.</p>
<p>3) They also decreed, that we should not listen to musical instruments not even to the singing of songs. During meals, you should sing only the traditional <italic>zemiros</italic> [songs of praise], like those we sing on Shabbos; but it is forbidden to sing other songs.</p>
<p>4) Take heed not to attend animal shows presented by non-Jews<sup><xref rid="fn591">9</xref></sup> or their dances or any of their social functions. When you hear them giving voice to their happiness, you should sigh and agonize over the destruction of Jerusalem, and pray for it unto the Holy One blessed is He. Even animal shows presented by Jews, are forbidden because it is a &#x201C;Gathering of scorners.&#x201D; All kinds of rejoicing are forbidden, except making a groom and a bride happy which may be done both by singing and with musical instruments. But even at a wedding, you should not overdo the merry making. It is forbidden for anybody to laugh exuberantly in this world, even when rejoicing in the performance of a mitzvah,<sup><xref rid="fn592">10</xref></sup> for it is said: &#x201C;<italic>Then</italic> our mouth will be filled with laughter&#x201D; (Psalms 126:2). [When Hashem will return the captivity to Zion].</p>
<ftnote id="fn583">1. It is, however, permitted to build a <italic>Beis Midrash</italic> or Synagogue without any restrictions. (<italic>Biyur Halachah</italic> 560:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn584">2. <italic>Tur</italic> rules that if a house was merely painted, but not plastered, even though it was decorated, leaving an <italic>amah</italic> unpainted is sufficient. (see <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 560:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn585">3. If, however, the house was plastered with mud or clay, but not painted, it is not required to leave an <italic>amah</italic> unplastered. (Ibid. 560:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn586">4. See glossary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn587">5. Others have the custom to leave the <italic>amah</italic> above the door, because the main objective is that the inhabitants of the house see it and be reminded of the destruction, rather than those (strangers who enter the house on occasion). Leaving it opposite the entrance, only serves as a reminder, upon entering the house, but not as a reminder for those who spend time in the house. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 560:3)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn588">6. It is not proper to have it painted black. Those who have curtains (wall-paper) around all the walls of the house, should also leave an <italic>amah</italic> of bare walls. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 560:3)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn589">7. Omitting even a minor item is sufficient. On Shabbos or Yom Tov, however, nothing should be omitted from the traditional meals. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 560:5,6)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn590">8. <italic>Biyur Halachah</italic> (560:2) questions why this custom and the previous custom are not observed at all (in our time and place.)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn591">9. This also applies to theatrical presentations, presented by Jews. (see <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 224:3)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn592">10. Such as at a wedding or on Purim. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 560:20)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 127 Laws Concerning Private Fast Days</title>
<p>1) Just as it is a mitzvah for the community to fast and to pray in times of trouble, so it is a mitzvah for every individual, if, God forbid, any trouble befalls him, for example, a member of his family is sick, or he lost his way, or he is confined in prison on false charges, to fast and to pray to God, and to plead for mercy from Him, may His Name be blessed, to deliver him. Suffering is one of the ways that leads to repentance. A person should not say, his troubles just happened by chance, for it is said: (Leviticus 26:23,24). &#x201C;If you treat My (acts) as chance, then I will treat you with the fury of chance&#x201D;; which means, when I bring distress on you to cause you to repent and you will say this happened by chance, then I will add to your (suffering) the fury of the same &#x201C;chance.&#x201D; Man must know that because of his sins, God brought on him all this trouble. He should, therefore, examine his deeds and return to God, and He will have mercy on him.</p>
<p>2) If you wish to fast, you must make a commitment to do so<sup><xref rid="fn593">1</xref></sup> on the preceding day, during the <italic>Shemoneh esrei</italic> of <italic>Minchah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn594">2</xref></sup> In the berachah <italic>Shema koleinu</italic> [Hear our voices], you should mentally accept upon yourself, to fast and before saying <italic>Yiheyu leratzon</italic>, you should say, Master of the universe, I come before You to accept a fast etc.<sup><xref rid="fn595">3</xref></sup> (as it is written in the <italic>siddur</italic> [prayer book].) Even though you eat and drink, afterwards until daybreak, it does not matter. If you want to fast several days in succession, although you will eat and drink during the intervening nights, one acceptance [commitment] is sufficient for all. But if you accept upon yourself [to fast] several days that are not in succession, like Monday, Thursday, and Monday, you should make a separate commitment, for each day you fast, in the <italic>Minchah</italic> preceding it.<sup><xref rid="fn596">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) If you are accustomed to fast<sup><xref rid="fn597">5</xref></sup> during the <italic>Aseres yemei teshuvah</italic>, [the Ten Days of Penitence] or on the first day of <italic>Selichos</italic> or on <italic>erev Rosh Hashanah</italic>, you do not have to make a formal commitment because they are accepted on the basis of the prevailing custom. Similarly, fasting because of a disturbing dream, does not require prior acceptance; neither do the fasts on Monday, Thursday and Monday following <italic>Pesach</italic> and <italic>Sukkos</italic>. If you answer <italic>Amein</italic> after the <italic>Mi shebeirach</italic> [a blessing for those who fast on these days] and you intended to fast, this is sufficient, and no other form of acceptance is needed. Nevertheless, if you change your mind, and do not wish to fast, you may [eat], since you did not expressly commit yourself<sup><xref rid="fn598">6</xref></sup> and did not verbally declare that you intend to fast.</p>
<p>4) Even if you did not commit yourself verbally, to fast; doing so, only in your mind, resolving to fast the following day, and even [if you made this resolution] not during <italic>Minchah</italic>, but either before or after <italic>Mincha</italic>, while it was still daytime, it is considered an acceptance, and you are required to fast.</p>
<p>5) When you fast, you should not indulge in enjoyment, nor act frivolously. You should not go around happy and cheerful, but rather with anxiety and sorrow,<sup><xref rid="fn599">7</xref></sup> as it is said: &#x201C;Why should a living man bemoan? A man, because of his sins&#x0021;&#x201D; (Lamentations 3:39).</p>
<p>6) On a private fast day, you are allowed to rinse your mouth with water, in the morning.</p>
<p>7) If you committed yourself to fast without being specific, you must complete the fast until the stars come out, even on <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn600">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>8) If someone fasts and publicizes the fact, bragging about it, he will be punished for it.<sup><xref rid="fn601">9</xref></sup> But if people urge him to eat, he may let them know that he is fasting.</p>
<p>9) If you observe a fast, even if it is a private fast, whether it is a voluntary fast, or a fast because of a disturbing dream, you should say in the <italic>Shemoneh esrei</italic> of <italic>Minchah</italic>, in the berachah <italic>Shema koleinu</italic> [Hear our voice], the prayer <italic>Aneinu</italic> [Answer us], the same as on any public fast day. (And although you are only one individual, you should say it in the plural, and not deviate from the formula, that was established by the Sages). Before saying <italic>Yiheyu leratzon</italic>, you should say <italic>Ribbon ha&#x2019;olamim</italic> [Master of the universe] etc.<sup><xref rid="fn602">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>10) If you vowed to fast one day or ten days, but you did not specify the particular day or days, on which you were going to fast, but you stated it in indefinite terms, even if you committed yourself in the <italic>Minchah</italic> prayer to fast the following day, if an urgent need arises for you to eat something, for example, if you are invited to a meal, that is considered a mitzvah, even though you are not a party to the festive meal; or an important person urges you to join him in a meal, and it is difficult for you to refuse him, or if you do not feel well [enough to fast], then you may &#x201C;owe&#x201D; the fast [and repay it later] and you may eat on that day,<sup><xref rid="fn603">11</xref></sup> even if you already began to fast, and instead of fasting that day, you should fast another day. This is permissible only if the fast, you had accepted on yourself, was meant to fulfill a vow, however, if you had made no vow, but (specifically) committed yourself during <italic>Minchah</italic> to fast the following day, then, even if it causes you great distress, you are not permitted to &#x201C;owe&#x201D; your fast and repay it another day.</p>
<p>11) If at the time you made the vow, you specified certain days, and you also accepted it on yourself during <italic>Minchah</italic>, you may no longer &#x201C;owe&#x201D; your fast (to be paid later.).</p>
<p>12) If you undertook to fast, and are experiencing grave discomfort because of it, you may redeem it with money, according to your means, and you should give the money to the poor. But for a fast in fulfillment of a vow, redemption is of no avail. On a fast day, decreed by the community, redemption is also of no avail, unless the community made such a stipulation.</p>
<p>13) If you made a vow to fast on Monday, Thursday and Monday, you may change it to fasting on Thursday, Monday and Thursday, but not to any other days (of the week), for it is presumed, that you had these days in mind, because they are the days when the court is in session.</p>
<p>14) If you fast on Monday, Thursday, and Monday following <italic>Pesach</italic> and <italic>Sukkos</italic>, as well as on the <italic>Aseres yemei teshuvah</italic>, [the Ten Days of Penitence], and you did not commit yourself to fast during <italic>Minchah</italic>, but your fasting is motivated by the custom, even if you had in mind to fast, when responding <italic>Amein</italic> to the <italic>Mi shebeirach</italic>, as long as you did not resolve to fast during <italic>Minchah</italic>, then, if there is a <italic>bris</italic> [circumcision] or a <italic>pidyon haben</italic> [redemption of first born male] or any other meal celebrating a mitzvah, you are fulfilling a mitzvah by eating,<sup><xref rid="fn604">12</xref></sup> and you need not absolve your vows, for whoever fasts on these days is following the rules imposed by custom, and this custom of fasting was not intended in regard to a meal in celebration of a mitzvah.</p>
<p>15) In cases, where you are permitted to eat at a meal celebrating a mitzvah, the fast is, thereby, ended altogether, and you may eat afterwards, even in your own house; but before the festive meal, it is forbidden to eat. Only the father of the infant on the day of the <italic>bris</italic> and the <italic>sandak</italic> may eat even before the meal, since to them it is like a Yom Tov.</p>
<p>16) However, if you ate on a fast day in violation of the law, whether inadvertently or intentionally, you must complete the fast, even after having eaten. Afterwards, you must fast on Monday, Thursday and Monday, as an atonement for eating on the fast day.<sup><xref rid="fn605">13</xref> <xref rid="fn606">14</xref></sup> It is certainly true that you must fulfil your vow at a later time if you had to fast because of a vow you had made.</p>
<p>17) If you fast because of personal trouble, and the trouble passed, or if you fast for a sick person, and that person recovered or died, you must complete all the fast days that you committed yourself to observe. If someone accepted upon himself to fast or to do some other mitzvah until his son becomes Bar Mitzvah,<sup><xref rid="fn607">15</xref></sup> and the son died before that time, he must, nevertheless, fulfill his vow until the time his son would have become Bar Mitzvah. However, if you find out that before you committed yourself to fast, the cause for fasting had already passed<sup><xref rid="fn608">16</xref></sup> and your commitment, thus, was made in error, then you are not required to complete it.</p>
<p>18) Fasting is beneficial when accompained with repentance for nullifying the portents of a bad dream,<sup><xref rid="fn609">17</xref></sup> just as fire consumes the refuse of flax; but only if [you fast] on the day [you had the dream]. However, you are not required to fast, for (the Amora) Samuel said: &#x201C;Dreams speak falsehood,&#x201D; (Maseches Berachos 55b). You are, however, required to repent and to devote the entire day to the study of Torah and in prayer. Concerning fasting on Shabbos for a worrisome dream, see <italic>Orach Chaim</italic>, chapter 288.</p>
<ftnote id="fn593">1. If you do not make this commitment, it is not considered a fast. Thus, if you are fasting to fulfill a vow, and you fasted without making a prior commitment, you have not fulfilled your vow to fast. (see <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 562:23)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn594">2. It is preferable to do so at a <italic>Minchah Ketanah Shemoneh Esrei</italic> (nine and one half hours after sunrise), but, if not, you can do so at an earlier <italic>Minchah</italic>. (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 562:27)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn595">3. If you forgot to say this prayer, but you did, however, make a mental commitment to fast, it is sufficient. (<italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 562:6; <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 562:30,31)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn596">4. See <italic>Ramah</italic> 562:8. The prevailing custom is, however, that one acceptance is sufficient.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn597">5. This applies, even if this is the first time you are fasting on one of these days. So long as it is an accepted custom in your community, you may join and rely on those who have fasted. (<italic>Biyur Halachah</italic> 562:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn598">6. See Paragraph 4, and, accordingly, it would seem that it is best to be stringent, if you had in mind to fast when you answered <italic>Amein</italic>, even without a verbal commitment. (See <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 562:39)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn599">7. You should be careful to control your anger and to conduct your business activities in such manner, as not to become angry. (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 568:50)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn600">8. <italic>Ramah</italic>, however, rules, according to the <italic>Poskim</italic>, who maintain that on <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>, it is sufficient to fast until the congregation leaves the synagogue, after they accepted Shabbos (<italic>Kabbolas Shabbos</italic>). (<italic>Ibid</italic>. 249:21 and also <italic>Biyur Halachah</italic> 249:4)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn601">9. However, if you are asked if you are fasting, it would seem that you are permitted to acknowledge that you are. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic>, however, indicates that you should deny that you are fasting, unless you are asked to join someone in a meal, in which case you have no choice but to state you are fasting. On public fast days, however, you may say you are fasting in order to encourage others to do so. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 565:14)</ftnote>

<p>Master of the Universe, we know that during the time the Holy Temple stood, if a person sinned, he brought a sacrifice. The only part of the animal to be offered on the Altar was its blood and its fat, and in Your great compassion, You forgave him. But, now, because of our sins, the Holy Temple was destroyed, and we have no temple service to atone for us. Therefore, may it be Your will, that my blood and fat, that are diminished by fasting this day, be considered as though they were offered before You on the Altar, and, thus, may I find acceptance before you.</p>
<ftnote id="fn603">11. You should, however, fast a part of the day, and it is sufficient, therefore, if you eat at a later hour than you are accustomed; for example, if you usually eat at 10 A.M., you should eat at 11 A.M. In this way, at least, some of your vow will be fulfilled on the day you selected. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 568:9,10)</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn605">13. This rule applies only if you ate a <italic>kazayis</italic> of food, but if you ate less than that, you need not fast another day as an atonement.

<ftnote id="fn606">14. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> makes no mention of the need to fast on Monday, Thursday and Monday as an atonement. It would seem that one day is sufficient as an atonement.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 128 Laws Concerning the Month of Elul</title>
<p>1) [The days] from <italic>Rosh Chodesh Elul</italic> until after <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, are days of Divine favor [and acceptance.] Even though throughout the entire year the Holy One, blessed is He, accepts the repentance of those who return to Him wholeheartedly, nevertheless, these days are unexcelled and most suitable for repentance, because they are days of mercy and favor. On <italic>Rosh Chodesh Elul</italic>, Moshe went up Mount Sinai to receive the Second Tablets; he remained there for forty days, and came down on the tenth day of <italic>Tishrei</italic> when the atonement was completed. From then on these days have been designated as days of Divine favor [and acceptance,] and the tenth day of <italic>Tishrei</italic> as <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> [Day of Atonement]. In most communities it is the custom to fast on the day before <italic>Rosh Chodesh Elul</italic> and to recite the prayers of <italic>Yom Kippur Katan</italic> [minor Yom Kippur], in order to be spiritually prepared for repentance. If <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> occurs on Shabbos, <italic>Yom Kippur Katan</italic> is held on the preceding Thursday. The Ari (Rabbi Yitzchak Luria), of blessed memory, wrote, &#x201C;If he did not lie in ambush but Hashem made it happen, then I will provide &#x2026;&#x201D; (Exodus 21:13) The initials of the words [<italic>ina le&#x2019;yado vesamti lecha</italic>] form the acronym <italic>Elul</italic>, to indicate that this month is a favorable time for repentance to be accepted for the sins committed during the entire year. It also alludes to the fact that sins done inadvertently also require repentance<sup><xref rid="fn610">1</xref></sup> during this month. The interpreters of allusions also commented: It is written (Deuteronomy 30:6) &#x201C;And Hashem your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your children;&#x201D; the initials of the words [<italic>es levavecho ve&#x2019;es levav</italic>] form the acronym <italic>Elul</italic>. Also, the initials of <italic>Ani ledodi vedodi li</italic>, [&#x201C;I am my Beloved&#x2019;s and my Beloved is mine,&#x201D;]<sup><xref rid="fn611">2</xref></sup> [Song of Songs 6:3] form the acronym <italic>Elul</italic>. Also, the initials of <italic>Ish lerei&#x2019;eihu umatanos la&#x2019;evyonim</italic> [&#x201C;One to another and gifts to the poor&#x201D;] (Esther 9:22) form the acronym <italic>Elul</italic>. These acronyms are an allusion to three things: Repentance, Prayer and Charity which must be practiced zealously during this month. &#x201C;Hashem will circumcise etc.&#x201D; alludes to repentance, &#x201C;I am my Beloved&#x2019;s etc.&#x201D; alludes to prayer, for prayer is the song of love. &#x201C;One to another and gifts to the poor,&#x201D; alludes to charity.</p>
<p>2) It is customary to blow the <italic>shofar</italic> during this month. Beginning the second day of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn612">3</xref></sup> we blow the <italic>shofar</italic> each day after the <italic>Shacharis</italic> prayer, <italic>tekiah, shevarim, teruah, tekiah</italic>, except on <italic>erev Rosh Hashanah</italic>, when the blowing is discontinued,<sup><xref rid="fn613">4</xref></sup> in order to make a distinction between the voluntary blowing of the <italic>shofar</italic> and the blowing <italic>shofar</italic> in fulfillment of the mitzvah. The reason for blowing the <italic>shofar</italic> during this month is to arouse the people to repent; for the <italic>shofar</italic> sound has the quality to stir [the emotions] and to inspire fear, as Scripture says, (Amos 3:6) &#x201C;If a <italic>shofar</italic> is sounded in a city will the people not tremble?&#x201D; It is also the custom in our regions, beginning with the second day of <italic>Rosh Chodesh Elul</italic> until <italic>Shemini Atzeres</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn614">5</xref></sup> to recite Psalm [27] <italic>LeDovid Hashem ori ve&#x2019;yish&#x2019;i</italic><sup><xref rid="fn615">6</xref></sup> [&#x201C;Of David, Hashem is my light and my salvation&#x201D;] [each day] [after] the morning and evening prayers,<sup><xref rid="fn616">7</xref></sup> This is based on the <italic>Midrash:</italic> &#x201C;Hashem is my light&#x201D; &#x2014;on <italic>Rosh Hashanah;</italic> &#x201C;and my salvation&#x201D; &#x2014;on <italic>Yom Kippur;</italic> &#x201C;for He will hide me in His shelter&#x201D; &#x2014;alludes to <italic>Sukkos</italic>. It also is customary for the congregation to recite Psalms,<sup><xref rid="fn617">8</xref></sup> each locality according to its custom.<sup><xref rid="fn618">9</xref></sup> Beginning with the month of <italic>Elul</italic> until <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, when you write a letter to your friend you should mention, either at the beginning or at the end that you pray for him and bless him to be worthy during the forthcoming Days of Judgment to be inscribed and sealed in the Book of Good Life.</p>
<p>3) Pious men are accustomed to examine their <italic>tefillin</italic> and <italic>mezuzos</italic> during this month; and wherever any defect may be found in other mitzvohs, to repair it.</p>
<p>4) Beginning with the Shabbos following <italic>Tishah beAv</italic> and after that, for the next seven <italic>Shabbosos</italic> we read the <italic>haftoras &#x201C;sheva denechamasa&#x201D;</italic> [seven <italic>haftoras</italic> of consolation]. If the first day of <italic>Rosh Chodesh Elul</italic> occurs on Shabbos, the <italic>haftorah, Aniyah so&#x2019;arah</italic>, is set aside [&#x201C;O you afflicted, floundering in the storm,&#x201D;] (Isaiah 54:11) and we read instead, <italic>&#x201C;Hashamayim kis&#x2019;i,&#x201D;</italic> [The heaven is My throne] (Isaiah 66:1), because this <italic>haftorah</italic> also contains consolation for Jerusalem. On the Shabbos of <italic>Parshas Ki Seitzei</italic>, when the <italic>haftorah Roni akarah</italic> [Sing, O barren woman] (Isaiah 54:1) is read, we conclude the <italic>haftorah</italic> with <italic>Aniyah so&#x2019;arah</italic>, which is next to it. If, by mistake, on <italic>Shabbos Rosh Chodesh Elul</italic>, you said <italic>Aniyah so&#x2019;arah</italic>, and you became aware of it before saying the concluding berachos, you should also say <italic>Hashamayim kis&#x2019;i</italic>, and then say the concluding berachah. If you only became aware [of your error] after saying the concluding berachos, then you should recite, <italic>Hashamayim kis&#x2019;i</italic> without the berachos. If <italic>Rosh Chodesh Elul</italic> occurs on Sunday, the <italic>haftorah, Machar Chodesh</italic> is set aside, [Tomorrow is <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>] (I Samuel 20:18), because it contains no consolation for Jerusalem, and the <italic>haftorah Aniyah so&#x2019;arah</italic> is read.</p>
<p>5) Beginning with the Sunday before <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> and thereafter we rise early for <italic>Selichos</italic>, [special prayers for forgiveness]. If <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> occurs on Monday or Tuesday, we begin [to say <italic>Selichos</italic>] from the Sunday of the preceding week. When you get up early in the morning [before daylight] you must wash your hands and say the berachah <italic>Al netilas yadayim</italic>, [regarding washing the hands] and the berachah of the Torah. After the <italic>Selichos</italic> [if it is daylight], you should wash your hands again without saying a berachah.</p>
<p>6) The <italic>Chazzan</italic> who leads the <italic>Selichos</italic> prayers should put on a <italic>tallis</italic> with <italic>tzitzis</italic> before saying <italic>Ashrei</italic>. Since it is doubtful, whether a berachah should be said when putting on his own <italic>tallis</italic> at night or not, therefore, the <italic>Chazzan</italic> should take neither his own <italic>tallis</italic><sup><xref rid="fn619">10</xref></sup> nor one belonging to the congregation, but should borrow one from someone. If no <italic>tallis</italic> is available, he may say <italic>Selichos</italic> and the <italic>Shelosh esrei midos</italic> [&#x201C;The thirteen attributes&#x201D;] without wearing a <italic>tallis</italic>. It is customary in some communities that the <italic>Chazzan</italic> who leads the <italic>Selichos</italic> prayers should also officiate at the <italic>Shacharis</italic> and <italic>Minchah</italic> services, as well as at the <italic>Maariv</italic> service of the preceding night. He takes precedence over a mourner, a mohel, and a person observing <italic>yahrzeit</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn620">11</xref></sup> It is proper to stand while saying the <italic>Selichos</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn621">12</xref></sup> but a person who finds it difficult to stand should at least stand while saying <italic>keil melech yosheiv</italic> [&#x201C;God, King Who is enthroned&#x201D;] etc. and the <italic>Shelosh esrei midos</italic> [&#x201C;Thirteen attributes of mercy&#x201D;]. For the laws regarding the recitation of the <italic>Viduy</italic> (the confession of sins, the <italic>Al cheit</italic>), see Chapter 131:9 below.</p>
<p>7) [The congregation] should be discriminating to choose as <italic>Chazzan</italic> to lead the services of <italic>Selichos</italic> and the <italic>Yomim Noraim</italic> [<italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>] a man who is highly respectable, a Torah scholar, known for his good deeds. He should be no less than thirty years old, for by then moderation has calmed his youthful hot-bloodedness, and his heart is subdued. He should also be married and have children,<sup><xref rid="fn622">13</xref></sup> so that he will pour out his heart and pray for mercy from the bottom of his heart. [The congregation] should also be discriminating in selecting as the <italic>tokei&#x2019;a</italic> &#x2014;the person who blows the <italic>shofar</italic> on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, &#x2014;and as the person who prompts him, men who are Torah scholars and God-fearing. However, any Jew is eligible to officiate at any religious function, provided he is acceptable to the congregation. But if you see that your appointment will cause quarreling you should withdraw, even though an unworthy person will be chosen.</p>
<p>8) During the twelve months of mourning for a father or mother, a person should not officiate as <italic>Chazzan</italic> on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, neither should he blow the <italic>shofar</italic> on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn623">14</xref></sup> unless there is no one else as qualified as he is.<sup><xref rid="fn624">15</xref></sup> If he is in the first thirty days [of mourning] for other relatives, then, if he regularly officiated in previous years as <italic>Chazzan</italic> or as <italic>tokei&#x2019;a</italic>, he is permitted to do so [now]<sup><xref rid="fn624">15</xref></sup> because <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> cancel the thirty day mourning period, but if he is not the regular <italic>Chazzan</italic>, and there is someone else as qualified as he is, we are stringent [and do not permit him to officiate]. But during the period when we say <italic>Selichos</italic>, even on <italic>erev Rosh Hashanah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn625">16</xref></sup> any mourner may act as <italic>Chazzan</italic>, but not during the <italic>shivah</italic> [the first seven days of mourning].</p>
<p>9) A person who says <italic>Selichos</italic> privately is not permitted to recite the &#x201C;Thirteen Attributes of mercy&#x201D; as a prayer or as a plea, but as if he were reading them from the Torah, with the appropriate cantillation chant. Wherever there is mention made of the &#x201C;Thirteen Attributes,&#x201D; such as, &#x201C;And remember for us this day the covenant of the thirteen [attributes],&#x201D; and similar passages, he should omit them. Also the supplications that are written in the Aramaic language, such as, <italic>Machei umasei</italic> [He strikes and He heals] etc., and <italic>Maran di vishemeya</italic> [Master in heaven] etc. should only be said with a <italic>minyan</italic>.</p>
<p>10) A mourner [during the <italic>shiva</italic>] is forbidden to leave his house to go to the synagogue in order to say <italic>Selichos</italic>, except on <italic>erev Rosh Hashanah</italic>, when many <italic>Selichos</italic> are said.</p>
<p>11) The <italic>Chazzan</italic> who will officiate on the &#x201C;Days of Awe&#x201D;, as well as the <italic>tokei&#x2019;a</italic>, should abstain three days before <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> from anything that may cause <italic>tum&#x2019;ah</italic> &#x2014;(impurity). They should study the meaning of the prayers and the special liturgical poems and the laws concerning the blessing of the <italic>shofar</italic> to the best of their ability. They should also study books on devoutness and ethics that arouse man&#x2019;s heart to fear God and the splendor of His grandeur when He rises to judge the world. If the congregation is unable to find a <italic>tokei&#x2019;a</italic> who is a Torah scholar, they should at least see to it that the prompter is a Torah scholar, well versed in the laws of the blowing of the <italic>shofar</italic>, so that if an error is made in the sounds of the <italic>shofar</italic>, he should know what to do; and he should also know how to examine the <italic>shofar</italic> to determine if it is fit to be used.</p>
<p>12) Many people are accustomed to fast during the Ten Days of Penitence, but since this period includes four days on which fasting is not permitted, namely, the two days of <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, Shabbos, and <italic>erev Yom Kippur</italic>, they make up for them by fasting four of the <italic>Selichos</italic> days before <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, that is, the first day of <italic>Selichos, erev Rosh Hashanah</italic> and two other intervening days, preferably Monday and Thursday. If a meal that is considered a mitzvah occurs [on one of these days] they are permitted to eat at the meal and compensate by fasting on another day. If they know beforehand that they are invited to a meal celebrating a mitzvah, they should fast the day before [the meal], to make up for it.</p>
<p>13) It is customary to go to the cemetery <italic>erev Rosh Hashanah</italic> after the <italic>Shacharis</italic> prayers and bow prayerfully at the graves of <italic>tzaddikim</italic> [righteous men]. Charity should be given to the poor, and many fervent supplications offered to arouse the saintly <italic>tzaddikim</italic>, in their eternal resting place to intercede for us on the Day of Judgement. An additional reason for going to the cemetery is that the place where <italic>tzaddikim</italic> are buried is sacred and pure, and prayers are more readily accepted when they are offered on sacred ground, and the Holy One, blessed is He, will show us kindness for the sake of the <italic>tzaddikim</italic>. But it should not be your intention to appeal to the dead who rest there, for that would be tantamount to &#x201C;Inquiring of the dead,&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 18:11), which is forbidden, but you should ask of Hashem, blessed is His name, to have mercy on you for the sake of the <italic>tzaddikim</italic> who rest in the dust. When you arrive at the cemetery, if you have not seen graves within the past thirty days, you must say the berachah: <italic>Asher yatzar eschem badin</italic> [Who has formed you in judgement etc.] (see Chapter 60:11. above) When you approach the grave, you should say, &#x201C;May it be Your will, that the repose of [so-and-so] who is buried here, be in peace, and may his merit aid me.&#x201D; When placing your hand on the grave, the left hand only should be placed, &#x2014;not the right hand. You should recite the verse, &#x201C;Hashem will always guide you, and satisfy your soul with splendor, and make your bones strong, you will be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose water will not fail.&#x201D; (Isaiah 58:11) &#x201C;May you lie in peace, and may you sleep in peace until <italic>Menachem</italic> (the Comforter, <italic>Moshiach</italic>) comes, announcing peace.&#x201D; (When placing your hand [on the grave] you should have in mind the verse, &#x201C;Hashem will always guide you,&#x201D; which contains fifteen words the same as the number of joints in the hands.) You should not visit the same grave twice on the same day. Reading the inscription on a headstone, if it is protruding, causes forgetfulness. A remedy for that is to say the prayer <italic>Ahavah rabbah</italic> (With abundant love) up to <italic>uleyachedcha be&#x2019;ahavah</italic> [and to proclaim Your Oneness with love].</p>
<p>14) On <italic>erev Rosh Hashanah</italic> it is the universal custom to fast<sup><xref rid="fn626">17</xref></sup> until after <italic>Minchah</italic>, at which time you may eat something so that you do not welcome the Yom Tov in a state of affliction. The entire day should be spent learning Torah, performing mitzvos and in repentance, especially of sins committed against your fellow man. You should not wait until <italic>erev Yom Kippur</italic>, but, promptly, without delay, you should ask forgiveness of your friends, [neighbors, and family.]</p>
<p>15) You should bathe and have your hair cut on <italic>erev Rosh Hashanah</italic> in honor of Yom Tov. You should have your haircut before midday. You should immerse yourself in the <italic>mikvah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn627">18</xref></sup> We wear our Shabbos clothes<sup><xref rid="fn628">19</xref></sup> on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, to indicate that we trust in the kindness of Hashem, blessed is His Name, to bring forth our judgement as a shining light.</p>
<p>16) It is customary to do <italic>hataras nedarim</italic> [to annul certain vows] on <italic>erev Rosh Hashanah</italic>. (An allusion [for this can be found in the words] <italic>Lo yacheil devaro kechol</italic>, [He must not break his word (Numbers 30:3)]; the last letters of which form the acronym <italic>Elul</italic>.) A person who does not understand what he is reciting in Hebrew, should say it in the language he understands.</p>

<ftnote id="fn611">2. During these forty days, since repentance is more readily accepted, our repentance brings our hearts closer to our Beloved One and thus He, (our Beloved) is closer to us by accepting our repentance. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> preface to Chapter 581)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn612">3. Some have the custom to blow shofar even on the first day of Rosh Chodesh Elul.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn613">4. It is permitted, however, to blow shofar in order to practice in preparation for the obligatory sounding of the shofar on Rosh Hashanah. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 581:24)</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn615">6. On those days when the <italic>Musaf</italic> service is said, the psalm is recited after <italic>Shacharis</italic>, before <italic>Ein Komocha</italic> [there is none like You] which is said before the <italic>Seifer Torah</italic> is taken out of the Ark. In the evening the psalm is recited after the <italic>Minchah</italic> service. [This is the custom of those who pray <italic>Nusach Sfard</italic>.] In those places where they recite the psalm after the entire service [including <italic>Musaf</italic>] is completed, such as on Rosh Chodesh, the psalm, <italic>Borchi Nafshi</italic> [Psalm 104] is recited before <italic>LeDovid Hashem Ori</italic>. They also have the custom to recite <italic>LeDovid Hashem Ori</italic> after the psalm of the day is recited. [This is the custom of those who pray <italic>Nusach Ashkenaz</italic>.] (<italic>Ibid</italic> 581:2)</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn618">9. The custom is to recite ten chapters each day, and during the days between <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, extra chapters are recited so that the entire Book of Psalms will have been said three times. (<italic>Ibid</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn619">10.

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 129 Laws of Rosh Hashanah</title>
<p>1) In all the <italic>kaddish</italic> prayers recited from <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> through <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, you should repeat the word <italic>le&#x2019;eila</italic> [He is higher]; thus you should say <italic>le&#x2019;eila le&#x2019;eila</italic>, [He is exceedingly higher], (without adding the <italic>vav, ule&#x2019;eila</italic>). Since the <italic>kaddish</italic> must contain twenty-eight words [from <italic>yehei shemei rabba</italic> until <italic>be&#x2019;alema</italic>] and the entire year you say <italic>le&#x2019;eila min kol birchasa</italic> [He is beyond any blessing], you say now <italic>le&#x2019;eila le&#x2019;eila mikol birchasa</italic>.</p>
<p>2) Some people have the custom when praying on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> [to pray] every <italic>Shemoneh esrei</italic> with their bodies bent and their heads bowed. However, since you must bow at the berachah, <italic>Magein Avraham</italic> [Shield of Abraham] and <italic>Modim</italic> [we give thanks], at the beginning and at the end, therefore, before reaching these <italic>berachos</italic> it is necessary to straighten up in order to bow as required by our Sages of blessed memory. It is also forbidden to bow at the beginning and at the end of any berachah that was not instituted by our Sages of blessed memory. It is best [therefore] to pray while standing erect,<sup><xref rid="fn629">1</xref></sup> but with a humble heart and with tears. The practice of praying in a loud voice should be abolished, because you should pray quietly as you do the entire year. Some authorities permit to raise the voice slightly, but not too much. You should be careful to pronounce your prayers correctly; not to change even one vowel. You should try to obtain a <italic>Siddur</italic> or <italic>Machzor</italic> that is carefully edited, from which to pray.</p>
<p>3) All through the year you say in the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei, hakeil hakadosh</italic> [the Almighty, the Holy One], and <italic>melech oheiv tzedakah umishpat</italic> [King Lover of righteousness and justice] except from <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> until after <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, when you must say instead <italic>Hamelech hakadosh</italic> (the King, the Holy One) and <italic>Hamelech hamishpat</italic> (the King of Justice), because on these days the Holy One blessed is He manifests His dominion by judging the world. If, by mistake, you said <italic>Hakeil hakadosh</italic>, or if you are in doubt whether you said <italic>Hakeil hakadosh</italic> or <italic>Hamelech hakadosh</italic>; if you become aware of the error within the time needed to utter a short greeting, [<italic>Shalom Alecha Rebbe</italic>] you should say <italic>Hamelech hakadosh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn630">2</xref></sup> and you need not start again from the beginning. The same law applies to <italic>Hamelech hamishpat</italic>. But, if you only became aware of it after the time needed for a short greeting, then, at <italic>Hamelech hakadosh</italic> you must repeat <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic> from the beginning, (even if in doubt),<sup><xref rid="fn631">3</xref></sup> because the first three <italic>berachos</italic> are considered as one (as is written in Chapter 19:2). Even the <italic>Chazzan</italic> during the repetition of the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>, must repeat from the beginning [if he did not say <italic>Hamelech hakadosh</italic>], and the <italic>kedusha</italic> must be said again. But at <italic>Hamelech hamishpat</italic>, even an individual need not repeat, even that berachah, since he mentioned the word <italic>melech</italic> &#x201C;King&#x201D; in that berachah. During the entire year, if you said, by mistake, <italic>Hamelech hakadosh</italic> or <italic>Hamelech hamishpat</italic>, you need not repeat the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>.</p>
<p>4) In the <italic>Maariv</italic> service on Friday night, in the abridged form of the seven berachos, in <italic>Magein avos</italic> (Shield of our forefathers etc.) you also say, instead of <italic>Hakeil hakadosh</italic> the words <italic>Hamelech hakadosh</italic>. If the <italic>Chazzan</italic> made an error and said <italic>Hakeil hakadosh</italic>, then, if he becomes aware of it immediately, within the time span needed for a short greeting, he should say <italic>Hamelech hakadosh etc.</italic>; but if he becomes aware of it later he need not repeat the berachah.</p>
<p>5) If you forgot to say <italic>Zochreinu</italic> [Remember us], or <italic>Mi chamocha</italic> [Who is like You], or <italic>Uchsov</italic> [And inscribe], or <italic>Beseifer chayim</italic> [In the book of life] and you do not become aware of it until you said <italic>Baruch ata Hashem</italic>, [Blessed are You, Hashem], since you mentioned <italic>Hashem</italic>, you should conclude the berachah,<sup><xref rid="fn632">4</xref></sup> and continue the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>, and you need not repeat it. Similarly, if you forgot to say [the entire section beginning with] <italic>Uvechein tein pachdecha</italic> [And so, grant that Your awe] and you concluded the berachah, <italic>Hamelech hakadosh</italic>, even if you only said <italic>Baruch ata Hashem</italic>, you should conclude <italic>Hamelech hakadosh</italic>, and then say <italic>Ata vechartanu</italic> [You have chosen us] etc.</p>
<p>6) At the conclusion of the <italic>Shemoneh esrei</italic>, some are accustomed to say <italic>Oseh</italic> ha <italic>shalom</italic> [He Who makes <italic>the</italic> peace], while others do not change, and say [the usual text], <italic>Hamevareich es amo Yisrael ba shalom</italic>, [Who blesses His people Israel with peace]. But in the <italic>kaddish</italic>, we say <italic>Ose</italic> ha <italic>shalom bimeromav</italic> [He Who makes <italic>the</italic> peace in His high heavens.]</p>
<p>7) If <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> occurs on Shabbos, in some communities they say <italic>Lechu neranenah</italic> [Come, let us sing], the same as on any other Shabbos; in other communities they begin with <italic>Mizmor leDovid</italic> [A psalm of David]; still in other communities they begin with <italic>Mizmor shir leyom haShabbos</italic> [A Psalm, a song for the Shabbos day]. Every community should follow its custom.</p>
<p>8) After the <italic>Maariv</italic> service on the first night of <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, it is customary for people to wish each other <italic>Leshanah tovah tikaseiv veseichaseim</italic> [May you be inscribed and sealed for a good year], and to a woman [you use the feminine form] <italic>tikaseivi veseichaseimi</italic>. But you do not extend these wishes in the daytime,<sup><xref rid="fn633">5</xref></sup> because the writing has been finished before midday. On the second night, some have the custom of saying [<italic>Leshanah tovah</italic>] because sometimes we are judged on the second day.<sup><xref rid="fn634">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>9) At the evening meal it is customary to prepare symbolic dishes [as auspicious omens] for a good year: you dip the piece of <italic>challah</italic> of <italic>Hamotzi</italic> in honey, and after eating a <italic>kazayis</italic> of <italic>challah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn635">7</xref></sup> you should say: <italic>Yehi ratzon shetechadeish aleinu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn636">8</xref></sup> <italic>shanah tovah umesukah</italic> [May it be Your will to renew for us a good and sweet year]. After this you should dip a piece of apple in honey, say the berachah, <italic>Borei peri ha&#x2019;eitz</italic>, and eat it. Then you say again <italic>Yehi ratzon etc.</italic> It is customary to eat the head of an animal and say <italic>Yehi ratzon shenih&#x2019;yeh lerosh</italic> [May it be Your will] that we will be heads (leaders). You should try to obtain the head of a sheep, which will also serve as a remembrance of the ram of Isaac. You should also eat vegetables the names of which, in the language of your country, allude to good things,<sup><xref rid="fn637">9</xref></sup> such as in our country, carrots (<italic>mehren</italic>) [<italic>mehren</italic> means to increase] and you should say <italic>Yehi ratzon sheyirbu zechuyoseinu</italic> [May it be Your will that our merits increase.] Some people have the custom to eat an elaborate fish course, symbolizing the blessing of fertility like the fish. The fish should not be cooked in vinegar because we must not eat sour or bitter foods on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>. You should eat choice meats and all kinds of sweets. It is also customary not to eat nuts and almonds,<sup><xref rid="fn638">10</xref></sup> because the numerical value of <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05B6;&#x05D2;&#x05D5;&#x05B9;&#x05D6;</span> <italic>egoz</italic> (nut) is 17, the same as <span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05B5;&#x05D8;</span> <italic>cheit</italic>, which means sin. Also, nuts increase phlegm and mucus which interferes with praying. It is proper to study Torah during the meal. Some have the custom of studying the <italic>Mishnah, Maseches Rosh Hashanah</italic>.</p>
<p>10) It is proper to abstain from marital relations during the two nights of <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> even if [the first night] occurs on Shabbos. But if it is the night of her immersion in the <italic>mikvah</italic>, you should not withold her conjugal rights, and you should immerse yourself in the <italic>mikvah</italic>, in the morning.</p>
<p>11) On <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, when you say <italic>Avinu malkeinu chatanu lefanecha</italic> [Our Father, our King, we have sinned before You] you should not beat your breast as on weekdays and on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, because we do not say <italic>vidui</italic> &#x2014;confession, on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, which is a Yom Tov. You should have this interpretation in mind [when saying <italic>Avinu malkeinu</italic>]: Our Father, our King, we have sinned before You, meaning, our forefathers sinned before You, because they worshiped idols, but as for us, we have no King but You. Therefore, our Father, our King, deal [kindly] with us for Your Name&#x2019;s sake.</p>
<p>12) When the <italic>Seifer Torah</italic> is removed from the Ark, it is customary to recite the Thirteen Attributes. You should begin with <italic>Vaya&#x2019;avor</italic> [and He passed by], and say <italic>Vaya&#x2019;avor Hashem al panav vayikra</italic><sup><xref rid="fn639">11</xref></sup> [Hashem passed by before him and He proclaimed] Hashem, Hashem, etc. On Shabbos, in some communities they say neither the Thirteen Attributes nor <italic>Ribbono shel olam</italic> [Master of the Universe].</p>
<p>13) The lengths of the various <italic>shofar</italic> tones, initially must be as follows: the <italic>Teruah</italic> consists of nine short sounds. The <italic>Shevarim</italic> should be blown as three consecutive sounds, each to be as long as three short <italic>Teruah</italic> sounds, so that the <italic>Shevarim</italic> is also equal to nine sounds. You should be very careful not to draw out the <italic>Shevarim</italic> until each [of the three] <italic>Shevarim</italic> sounds equals nine <italic>Teruah</italic> sounds, for in that case, even ex post facto, after it is already done, you have not fulfilled your duty. The <italic>Tekios</italic> are simple blasts. In the order of <italic>Tekiah, Shevarim, Teruah, Tekiah</italic>, each <italic>Tekiah</italic> should be as long as the <italic>Shevarim</italic> and the <italic>Teruah</italic>, combined, which is as long as eighteen sounds.<sup><xref rid="fn640">12</xref></sup> In the order of <italic>Tekiah, Shevarim, Tekiah</italic>, the sound of each <italic>Tekiah</italic> should be as long as the <italic>Shevarim</italic>, which is as long as nine sounds;<sup><xref rid="fn641">13</xref></sup> this is also true for the order of <italic>Tekiah, Teruah, Tekiah</italic>. In the sounding of the <italic>shofar</italic> before the <italic>Musaf</italic> service the <italic>Shevarim</italic> and the <italic>Teruah</italic> should be blown in one breath. Therefore, the prompter should call them at the same time, <italic>Shevarim-Teruah</italic>. In the blowing of the <italic>shofar</italic> during the repetition of the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>, they should be sounded in two breaths. Nevertheless, there should be no pause between them, but they should be sounded in immediate succession, and the prompter should also call them at the same time.</p>
<p>14) When the one blowing the <italic>shofar</italic> recites the <italic>berachos</italic>, the congregation should not respond <italic>Baruch hu uvaruch shemo</italic> [Blessed is He and blessed is His Name] (see chapter 6:8, above), but they should listen attentively to the <italic>berachos</italic> and after each berachah they should respond <italic>Amein</italic>, with concentration. It is forbidden to make any interruption from that point until after all the <italic>Tekios</italic> that are blown during the repetition of the <italic>Shemoneh Eesrei</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn642">14</xref></sup> Therefore, the <italic>Shammos</italic> should not announce: &#x201C;Silence please during the services&#x0021;&#x201D; even if he usually does so at other times.</p>
<p>15) People have the custom to recite <italic>Yehi ratzon</italic> [May it be the will] etc., between the three sets of <italic>shofar</italic> tones, as it is printed in the <italic>Machzor</italic>. You should be very careful not to articulate the names of the angels mentioned there. In many communities the <italic>Yehi ratzon</italic> is omitted entirely, and this is preferable. The main [reason for blowing the <italic>shofar</italic>] is to stir the people to wholehearted repentance. The <italic>Rambam</italic>, of blessed memory wrote, (Laws of Repentance 3:4) and these are his words: &#x201C;Although the blowing of the <italic>shofar</italic> on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, is ordained by Scriptural verse, it has an underlying message, as if the <italic>shofar</italic> were telling us, &#x2018;Wake up from your sleep, you slumberers, and you who are soundly asleep, awake from your deep sleep, scrutinize your deeds and repent, and remember your Creator. You, who are oblivious of the truth in your futile pursuit of transitory values, and engrossed all your years in the pursuit of vain and hollow things that are useless and will not save you, &#x2014; look at the state of your souls, and improve your ways and your deeds. Let each of you abandon his evil ways and his thoughts which are not good.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>16) During the repetition of the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic> when the <italic>Chazzan</italic> recites [the prayer] <italic>Va&#x2019;anachnu kore&#x2019;im</italic> [But we bow], it is customary for the congregation to say it along with him, and the people also bow and prostrate themselves, but they do not fall on their faces,<sup><xref rid="fn643">15</xref></sup> except on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, during the <italic>Avodah</italic> [the service of the <italic>Kohein gadol</italic>.] The <italic>Chazzan</italic> also bows, but since he is forbidden to move from his place during the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei;</italic> therefore, he stands slightly removed from the <italic>amud</italic> [<italic>Chazzan&#x2019;s</italic> desk] so that he can fall to his knees without moving from his place, and those who stand near him help him stand up so that he will not have to move his feet. The <italic>Tekios</italic> during the repetition of the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic> should not be blown by the <italic>Chazzan</italic> unless he is sure that he will not be confused [in his prayers]<sup><xref rid="fn644">16</xref></sup> as a result of it.</p>
<p>17) Regarding the <italic>Tekios</italic> in the repetition of the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>, there are different customs regarding the number of sounds to be blown. Each community should maintain its custom. Regarding the <italic>Tekios</italic> at the conclusion of the prayers, there are also different customs.<sup><xref rid="fn645">17</xref></sup> After the conclusion of all the <italic>Tekios</italic>, according to the local custom, the <italic>shofar</italic> should be hidden, and it should not be blown any more. Even a person wishing to officiate as <italic>tokei&#x2019;a</italic> on the second day of <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> may not blow it on the first day in order to practice.</p>
<p>18) If a <italic>bris</italic> is to be held in the synagogue it should be performed after the reading of the <italic>haftarah</italic>, before the blowing of the <italic>shofar</italic>. An allusion [to this sequence can be found in the <italic>Selichos</italic> prayer] &#x201C;Remember the covenant with Abraham (this refers to <italic>bris milah</italic>) and the binding of Isaac&#x201D; (this alludes to the <italic>shofar</italic>). On Shabbos the <italic>bris</italic> is performed after <italic>Ashrei</italic>. If the <italic>bris</italic> must be performed at the house of the infant&#x2019;s mother, it should be held after leaving the synagogue.</p>
<p>19) If you already fulfilled your obligation of blowing the <italic>shofar</italic>, and you must blow it for other people, you may also say the <italic>berachos</italic>. Nevertheless, it is best, that the person who has to fulfill his obligation [by virtue of listening to you blowing the <italic>shofar</italic>], should say the <italic>berachos</italic> himself. If you blow <italic>shofar</italic> for women, then, if you already fulfilled your obligation, you should not say the <italic>berachos</italic>, but the women should say the <italic>berachos</italic>, because, according to the law, women are exempt from blowing the <italic>shofar</italic>, since it is a positive precept dependent on a particular time. Other authorities say that a person who has already fulfilled his duty should not blow the <italic>shofar</italic> at all for women.<sup><xref rid="fn646">18</xref></sup> If you wish to blow the <italic>shofar</italic> for women you should do it before hearing the <italic>Tekios</italic> at the synagogue; and you should say the <italic>berachos</italic> on the <italic>Tekios</italic> with the intention of fulfilling your obligation thereby, but you should not do it during the first three hours of the day, for at that time you may not blow the <italic>shofar</italic> privately. You should either blow the <italic>shofar</italic> for the women at the time it is blown in the synagogue or after that; but you should have in mind [when you are in the synagogue] not to fulfill your duty with these <italic>Tekios</italic> but only with the <italic>Tekios</italic> which you will sound for the women, and [on these <italic>Tekios</italic>] you should say the <italic>berachos</italic>. Although you will go to the synagogue afterwards to pray <italic>Musaf</italic>, and hear the <italic>Tekios</italic> sounded during the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>, the interruption does not require you to repeat the <italic>berachos</italic>, since all the <italic>Tekios</italic> constitute one mitzvah. If a woman feels weak and needs to eat before the <italic>Tekios</italic>, she is permitted to eat.</p>
<p>20) When leaving the synagogue, we should walk unhurried and relaxed, happy and cheerful, confident that God has heard our prayers and the sounds of the <italic>shofar</italic> with compassion. You should eat and drink [in generous measure] enjoying the bountiful gifts of God. You should, nevertheless, take care not to overeat and the fear of God should be upon you. It is proper to study Torah at the table. After saying <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> you should not go to sleep,<sup><xref rid="fn647">19</xref></sup> but rather go to the synagogue and recite Psalms with the congregation<sup><xref rid="fn648">20</xref></sup> until the <italic>Minchah</italic> service. Only a person who has a headache may sleep a little before going to the synagogue.</p>
<p>21) After the <italic>Minchah</italic> service<sup><xref rid="fn649">21</xref></sup> you should go to a river [or stream] (to recall the merit of the <italic>Akeidah</italic>, [the binding of Yitzchak] for the <italic>Midrash</italic> relates that when our Father Avraham went to the <italic>Akeidah</italic> with his son Yitzchak, Satan transformed himself into a river to deter him. But our Father Avraham, peace be upon him, walked into the river until [the water reached] his neck and said, &#x201C;Deliver me, O God, for the waters have reached until my soul.&#x201D; (Psalm 69:2) There is another reason [for this custom]; for on this day we proclaim the kingship of the Holy One, blessed is He, over us, and it was the custom to anoint kings near a river bank as a sign that their kingdom may endure without end.)<sup><xref rid="fn650">22</xref></sup> It is preferable that [this river] should be outside the city limits and it should contain fish (as a reminder that we are compared to living fish who are caught in a net. We too, are caught in the net of death and judgment, and as a result [we will be inclined] to think more of repenting. Another reason is to symbolize that the evil eye shall have no power over us, just as [it has no power] over fish, and that we may be fruitful and multiply as the fish. Others say the reason is that fish have no eyelids, and their eyes are always open, the purpose is thus to arouse the compassion of the All-Seeing Eye above us.) But if there is no river that contains fish you may go to any river, or to a well, and you should recite the verses, <italic>Mi keil kamocha</italic> [Who, Almighty, is like you] etc. as it is written in the prayer books in the text of <italic>Tashlich</italic>. You should then shake the ends of your clothes, symbolizing your resolve to cast away your sins, and to examine and scrutinize your ways, from now on; so that your &#x201C;clothes&#x201D; will be white and innocent of all sin. If the first day of <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> is on Shabbos you go [to the stream for <italic>Tashlich</italic>] on the second day.</p>
<p>22) After returning to the synagogue, if it is not yet time for <italic>Maariv</italic> you should avoid the company of friends in order not to engage, Heaven forbid, in idle talk. But you should study Torah or recite Psalms or study books on ethics, because this is a holy day unto our Master.</p>
<p>23) The two days of <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> are considered as one long day, and as one [extended period of] holiness (see Chapter 99:2 above). Therefore, the authorities differ whether in the <italic>Kiddush</italic> of the second night, or when lighting candles, or when blowing the <italic>shofar</italic> on the second day, you should say the berachah <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> or not. For some authorities say, since both days are one [extended period of] holiness and you already said <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> on the first day, you need not say it again on the second day. Therefore, it is the custom, when you recite the <italic>Kiddush</italic> on the second night, that a new fruit is placed on the table, in order that the <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> in the <italic>Kiddush</italic> should also apply to the fruit; You might also put on a new garment. If you have neither [a new fruit nor a new suit], it does not matter; you should still say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> in the <italic>Kiddush</italic>, for the <italic>Halachah</italic> is decided according to the authorities who say that we must say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> on the second night. A woman, too, when lighting the candles on the second night, (if she follows the custom of saying <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic>,)<sup><xref rid="fn651">23</xref></sup> should nevertheless, put on a new garment if possible, or place a new fruit [on the table], so that the <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> should apply also to these. But if she has neither of these it does not matter; she should still say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic>. Also the person who blows the <italic>shofar</italic> on the second day should, if possible, put on a new garment. However, if the first day occurs on Shabbos there is no need for this, for he has not yet said <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> on the <italic>shofar</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn629">1. This <italic>halachah</italic> is not mentioned in <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn630">2. This is so only if you did not yet begin the next <italic>berachah</italic>, but if you began the next <italic>berachah</italic>, even if it is still within <italic>toch kedei dibur</italic>, you must start from the beginning of <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 582:7)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn631">3. However, if you are certain that you <italic>intended</italic> to say <italic>Hamelech hakadosh</italic>, and then much later you became doubtful if you actually said it or not, you need not repeat the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>. If, however, the doubt came into mind <italic>immediately</italic> after you completed <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>, you must repeat the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 114:38) If on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur there is a doubt if you said Hamelech hakadosh, you need not repeat the Amidah, since you can assume that you said it as part of the special prayers of Yom Tov. (Ibid 582:4)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 130 Laws Relating to the Ten Days of Repentance</title>
<p>1) The Ten Days of Repentance, as characterized by their name, are designated for repentance. During this time everyone is obligated to repent wholeheartedly before God, blessed is His Name, before the coming of the great and awesome day, of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, as it is said, &#x201C;Before God you will be cleansed&#x201D; (Leviticus 16:30). It is also said, &#x201C;Seek God when He may be found&#x201D;, (Isaiah 55:6) and our Rabbis of blessed memory said, that this refers to the ten days between <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>. Therefore, during these days you must examine your conduct and repent of your bad deeds. Sins about which you are in doubt require greater repentance than transgressions of which you are certain, for a person is more regretful when he knows that he committed a sin, than when he is uncertain of it. Therefore, the guilt offering brought in case of doubtful sin must be of greater value than a regular sin offering. During these days You should study more Torah, perform more mitzvohs, give more charity, and spend less time on your business. It was written by Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, of blessed memory, that you should consider these days as if they were <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>, by performing only necessary work. Above all, you must set right the wrongs you committed against your fellow man, for which there is no atonement unless you compensate him for any stolen articles or withheld funds<sup><xref rid="fn652">1</xref></sup> in your possession, and patch things up and placate him so that he will forgive you.</p>
<p>2) It is proper to observe stringencies during these days that you do not observe the rest of the year, for we also ask of God, blessed is His Name, that He deal with us with exceptional kindness. For example, if during the rest of the year, you eat bread from a non-Jewish bakery, during these days you should eat only bread baked by a Jew; and you should observe similar stringencies.</p>
<p>3) When reciting <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, there are some who have the custom of saying <italic>Harachaman hu yechadeish</italic> [the Compassionate One, may He renew] etc. as we do on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>.</p>
<p>4) It is customary not to get married during these days.</p>
<p>5) On Shabbos <italic>Shuvah</italic> [the Shabbos during the Ten Days of Repentance] an eminent person should be called up for <italic>maftir</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn653">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) Some people have the custom not to sanctify the moon before the conclusion of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, for then everybody is joyful, whereas before <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> they are apprehensive about the outcome of their judgment Others maintain that, on the contrary, it is better to sanctify the moon before <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> in order to add to our merits with this mitzvah. It all depends on the prevailing custom. In a region where <italic>esrogim, lulavim</italic> and <italic>hadassim</italic> are for sale, it is the custom of pious men to purchase them ahead of time, so that during these days this precious mitzvah may be added to their merits.</p>
<ftnote id="fn652">1. It is also sufficient if you present the case in all honesty before a Rav or <italic>Posek</italic> and ask him to decide what you should do. It is, however, by no means proper for you to decide on your own, for regarding matters of money, the <italic>Yeitzer Harah</italic> (evil inclination) will help you find many loopholes. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 606:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn653">2. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> merely states that a youth should not be called up for <italic>Maftir</italic> on this Shabbos. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 602:11)</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Chapter 131 Laws of Erev Yom Kippur</title>
<p>1) It is customary to perform the <italic>kapparos</italic> ritual <italic>erev Yom Kippur</italic>, early in the morning, for then God&#x2019;s compassion is at its height. Men take roosters and women take hens, and a pregnant woman takes a rooster and a hen. The rooster is taken in case she is carrying a male; and if the child is a girl, one hen suffices for the mother and the child.<sup><xref rid="fn654">1</xref></sup> Even for other people, one <italic>kapparah</italic> is sufficient for two persons. You should select white chickens, for it is said, &#x201C;Though your sins will be like scarlet they will become white as snow.&#x201D; (Isaiah 1:18). But when buying, you should not express preference for white fowl and pay a higher price for it, for this resembles the customs of the Amorites [superstition]. But if you happen to find a white one among the fowl you bought, you should choose [the white one.] You take the <italic>kapparah</italic> in your right hand, and recite the verses <italic>Benei Adam</italic> [children of man] etc., move it around your head, and say: <italic>Zeh chalifasi</italic> [This is instead of me] etc. three times. If you move it around someone else&#x2019;s head, you say <italic>Zeh chalifasecha</italic> [This is instead of you]. You should first move it around your own head and then do it for others. It is preferable that the <italic>shechitah</italic> is done also early in the morning, immediately after the <italic>kapparos</italic> ritual.<sup><xref rid="fn655">2</xref></sup> You should not think that this <italic>kapparah</italic> ritual is an actual atonement, but you should consider that what is done to the fowl should be rightfully done to you, because of your sins. You should agonize over your sins, and the Holy One blessed is He, in His compassion, will accept your repentance. It is customary to throw the intestines, the liver and the kidneys of the <italic>kapparos</italic>, on the roof or into the courtyard, where the birds can take them, for it is appropriate to take pity on living creatures on that day, so that Heaven will take pity on us. Another reason is that birds usually steal the seeds they eat [we, therefore, throw away their digestive organs] so that we should be mindful to keep away from theft. If you cannot obtain chickens for <italic>kapparos</italic>, you can take a goose or some other living thing that is not ritually acceptable as a sacrifice on the altar in the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>. Some authorities say that even fish [may be used], but not pigeons or young doves, because these were acceptable as altar sacrifices, and it would appear as if you were bringing sacrifices outside the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> [which is forbidden]. Some people follow the custom of giving the <italic>kapparos</italic> chickens to the poor, but it is better to redeem the <italic>kapparos</italic> with money, and give the money to the poor.<sup><xref rid="fn656">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) We do not say <italic>Mizmor lesodah</italic> [a Psalm of thanksgiving], nor <italic>Tachanun</italic>, nor <italic>Lamenatzei&#x2019;ach</italic> on <italic>erev Yom Kippur</italic>. Neither do we recite <italic>Avinu malkeinu</italic> [our Father, our King]. Only when <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> occurs on Shabbos, do we say <italic>Avinu malkeinu</italic> on <italic>erev Yom Kippur</italic> in the <italic>Shacharis</italic> service.</p>
<p>3) It is a mitzvah to have elaborate meals and to eat and drink [abundantly]. The person who eats and drinks on <italic>erev Yom Kippur</italic> in order to fulfill this mitzvah, it is regarded to him, as if he fasted on that day also. It is a mitzvah to eat fish at the first meal.</p>
<p>4) Sins committed against your fellow man are not atoned for on Yom Kippur unless you placate him, as it is said, &#x201C;You will be cleansed of all your sins before God.&#x201D; This means, only sins against God are atoned for on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, but sins committed against your neighbor are not atoned for on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, unless you placate your neighbor. Everyone must, therefore, be very careful, if he has in his possession illegally acquired property, to return it and placate [the rightful owner]. If you are holding property of which you are not certain whether or not it legally belongs to you, you should let your neighbor know that you wish to appear with him, immediately after <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, before a <italic>Beis Din</italic> Rabbinical court to be judged according to the holy Torah; and you should firmly resolve to abide by the verdict pronounced by the <italic>Beis Din</italic>. If you sinned against your neighbor, even if only with words, you must appease him. It is your duty to go personally to appease him. However, if it is difficult for you to do so, or if you understand that he will be reconciled more easily through an intermediary, you should appease him through an intermediary. The person whose forgiveness is asked should forgive wholeheartedly and should not be ruthless, for this is not a Jewish characteristic, but a trait of Esau of whom it is said, &#x201C;And he kept his anger forever&#x201D; (Amos 1:11). It is also said of the Gibeonites, because they did not forgive and would not be appeased, &#x201C;The Gibeonites were not of the Children of Israel.&#x201D; (II Samuel 21:2) The characteristic of the Children of Israel is to be slow to anger and easy to be appeased. And when the sinner asks for forgiveness you should grant forgiveness wholeheartedly and willingly. Even if he tormented you a great deal you should not take revenge nor bear a grudge. On the contrary, if the offender does not take the initiative to come to you asking for forgiveness, you should present yourself to the offender in order that [the offender] should ask your forgiveness. If a person does not banish hatred [from his heart] on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, his prayers will not be heard, God forbid; but if you are tolerant and forgiving, all your sins will be forgiven.</p>
<p>5) If the wronged person has died, the offender should gather ten men at his grave, and say, &#x201C;I have sinned against the God of Israel and against this man&#x201D; and they respond, &#x201C;You are forgiven, you are forgiven, you are forgiven.&#x201D; He should walk barefoot, and spell out in detail the nature of the offense, unless it is humiliating to the dead. If the grave is more than three <italic>parsa</italic><sup><xref rid="fn657">4</xref></sup> away from the residence of the offender, he does not have to go there in person, but may send a representative. The representative should gather ten men to go to the grave, and say, &#x201C;I, the agent of so-and-so publicly declare that so-and-so has sent me to ask forgiveness for his sin,&#x201D; etc. If he insulted a dead person he does not have to go to his grave, but he should ask for his forgiveness at the place where he insulted him. But if he had defamed his character, he must accept upon himself to repent, for transgressing the prohibition of the early sages, against slandering the dead.</p>
<p>6) It is a mitzvah for every man to immerse in a mikvah on <italic>erev Yom Kippur</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn658">5</xref></sup> to purify himself from nocturnal emission, and also as an element of repentance, just as a convert is required to immerse in a <italic>mikvah</italic>. Therefore, even boys and girls<sup><xref rid="fn659">6</xref></sup> should immerse themselves in a <italic>Mikvah</italic>. You should be certain that there is no <italic>chatzitzah</italic> on your body [a particle intervening between the body and the water] (see Chapter 161 below). The most appropriate time for the immersion is after midday. A woman after intercourse is likely to discharge semen within three days. She is then considered as one who has had a nocturnal emission, and the immersion is pointless in this case. The practical thing for her to do, is before immersing, to wash herself well with warm water; she will then experience no further discharge. However, if she had intercourse soon after her monthly immersion in the <italic>mikvah</italic>, or immediately before her menstrual period, when she is likely to become pregnant, then she is forbidden to destroy the semen of conception, and she should, therefore, not wash herself in warm water. Nevertheless, she should immerse in cold water. A mourner, may the Merciful One protect us, even during the first seven days of mourning<sup><xref rid="fn660">7</xref></sup>, may wash and immerse himself<sup><xref rid="fn661">8</xref></sup> about one or two hours before nightfall, even before the <italic>Minchah</italic> service, but all the other laws of mourning, such as sitting on the floor, and not wearing [leather] shoes, must be observed until nighttime.</p>
<p>7) It is the custom that every head of the household prepares a candle for his house, as a reminder that on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> Moshe came down from Mount Sinai with the Second Tablets, of the Torah, and the Torah is called &#x201C;light&#x201D;; and he prepares another candle for the soul of his deceased father and mother, to make atonement for them.<sup><xref rid="fn662">9</xref></sup> It is customary that one candle is lit in the house to burn until the close of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, and <italic>Havdalah</italic> is said over it, (see Chapter 133:28 below) and one candle is lit in the synagogue. These candles should not be made out of wax taken from houses of idol worship. Some people become upset if their candle is extinguished on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, although in reality there is no reason to worry about this, still it is best to avoid it. It is best therefore to give the candle to the <italic>shamash</italic> (sexton), who will put it wherever he wishes, so that no one will know which is his candle. You should take the candle to the synagogue, when you go there for the <italic>Minchah</italic> service to be put in its proper place, and to be lit before twilight, because later, when people come to the synagogue for the <italic>Maariv</italic> service they are pressed for time.</p>
<p>8) When you go to the synagogue for the <italic>Minchah</italic> service it is the custom to put on Shabbos clothes. In the <italic>Minchah</italic> service, at the conclusion of the <italic>Shemnoneh Esrei</italic>, the <italic>Vidui</italic> [confessional] is said,<sup><xref rid="fn663">10</xref></sup>. Before <italic>Elokai netzor</italic>, [My God, guard my tongue] you say the verse, <italic>Yih&#x2019;yu leratzon</italic>, [May&#x2026; they be acceptable] etc., and then you say, <italic>Elokeinu v&#x2019;Elokei avoseinu</italic>, [Our God and the God of our forefathers] <italic>tavo lefanecha</italic> [may our prayer come before You], until <italic>vecholayim ra&#x2019;im</italic> [or serious illness]; then you say <italic>Eloka netzor</italic> etc. and you repeat the verse <italic>Yih&#x2019;yu leratzon</italic>. If, while you are saying the <italic>Vidui</italic> the <italic>Chazzan</italic> is repeating the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>, since you already said the verse <italic>Yih&#x2019;yu leratzon</italic>, you may respond <italic>Amein</italic>, and say the <italic>Kedusha</italic> and <italic>Modim</italic>, (see Chapter 18:14 above).</p>
<p>9) You must say the <italic>Vidui</italic> while standing in a bowed position, as when you say <italic>Modim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn664">11</xref></sup> and when mentioning each sin you should beat your heart<sup><xref rid="fn665">12</xref></sup> as if to say, &#x201C;You (the heart) caused me to sin. The order of the <italic>Vidui</italic>, set down in the <italic>Siddur</italic>, should be said by all alike. If you are aware of an individual sin not enumerated in the <italic>Vidui</italic>, since the <italic>Vidui</italic> is recited in an undertone, you should specify that sin, and confess it with a grieving heart, and profuse tears. If that sin is one that is mentioned in the <italic>Vidui</italic>, then, when you come to it, you should burst out in bitter self-reproach. Sins you confessed on the previous <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> may be confessed again, although you know that you did not commit them again,<sup><xref rid="fn666">13</xref></sup> and you are to be praised for doing so, as it is said, &#x201C;And my sin is always before me.&#x201D; (Psalms 51:15)</p>
<p>10) After the <italic>Minchah</italic> prayer, <italic>Avinu Malkeinu</italic> is not recited, regardless if <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> occurs on a weekday or on Shabbos.</p>
<p>11) After the <italic>Minchah</italic> service it is customary to receive [symbolic] lashes. Although these lashes are not real lashes, nevertheless, it will inspire the recipient to repent of his sins. A strap of calf&#x2019;s leather should be used, even though it is less than a <italic>tefach</italic> wide.<sup><xref rid="fn667">14</xref></sup> The one receiving the lashes should bend down and kneel with his face towards the North and his back towards the South. It is customary to recite confessions while receiving the lashes. The one who administers the lashes says <italic>Vehu rechum</italic> (He, the Merciful One) three times, which amounts to thirty-nine words, analogous to the thirty-nine lashes.</p>
<p>12) Towards evening you eat the closing meal, and it is customary to dip the piece of <italic>challah</italic> for <italic>Hamotzi</italic> in honey, just as you do on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>. You should eat only food that is easy to digest, such as fowl. It is the custom not to eat fish at the meal. You should not eat or drink anything that raises the body temperature, such as foods seasoned with spices and saffron.<sup><xref rid="fn668">15</xref></sup> You should be very careful to add from the secular to the sacred, that is, you should end the meal while it is still day, a little before twilight.<sup><xref rid="fn669">16</xref></sup> The zealous finish their meal early, about an hour before sunset. If you ended your meal while it is still the middle of the day, and you intend to eat or drink after that, you must stipulate before <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> and say explicitly, or at least have in mind that you do not yet accept the fast on yourself.</p>
<p>13) It is the custom in these regions not to store food to warm on <italic>erev Yom Kippur</italic>, to be used at the conclusion of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, as it is done on <italic>erev Shabbos</italic> for Shabbos, because it is equivalent to preparing food on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> for the weekday; and it also gives the impression of gluttony.</p>
<p>14) It is written, (Issiah 58:13), &#x201C;The holy [day] of Hashem should be honored&#x201D; and the Sages explain<sup><xref rid="fn670">17</xref></sup> that this refers to <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> for on that day there is no eating or drinking. It is a mitzvah to honor this day with clean clothes and with candlelight. Therefore, in the synagogue we spread beautiful covers and light many candles, which are called &#x201C;honor&#x201D;, as it is said, &#x201C;Honor Hashem, <italic>ba&#x2019;urim</italic>,&#x201D; (Isaiah 58:13) and the <italic>Targum</italic> translated it, &#x201C;Honor Hashem with lights.&#x201D; Before twilight, the tables should be covered with cloths, and candles should be lit in the house, as on <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>. A candle should be lit in the bedroom to prevent the occurence of marital relations.<sup><xref rid="fn671">18</xref></sup> Over the candles, the berachah<sup><xref rid="fn672">19</xref></sup> <italic>Lehadlik neir shel Yom haKippurim</italic> is said [to kindle the light of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>]. If <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> occures on Shabbos, the berachah, <italic>Lehadlik Neir shel Shabbos and Yom Kippur</italic> is said. (Concerning the berachah of <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> see Chapter 103:4 above)</p>
<p>15) It is the custom to put on a <italic>kittel</italic> (white robe) which is a garment of the dead. The wearing of such a garment causes the heart of man to be subdued and broken. A mourner may also wear a <italic>kittel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn673">20</xref></sup> Since it is a garment that is worn only at prayer, you should not wear it in the bathroom.<sup><xref rid="fn674">21</xref></sup> Women, too, should wear clean, white clothes in honor of the day; but they should not wear jewelry, because of the awe of judgemnt.</p>
<p>16) It is customary for the father and mother to bless their sons and daughters before going to the synagogue, because the holiness of the day has already begun, and the Gates of Compassion are already open. They implore in this blessing that the children should be sealed for good life, and that their hearts be steadfast in the fear of God, and they should plead, with tearful eyes, that their prayers be accepted. The children will also be inspired and resolve to walk in the ways of the righteous and follow the path of the just. Some people visit their relatives who are Torah scholars and righteous men to receive blessings from them, and ask them to pray for them on the holy and awesome day. You should do this early, while it is still the middle of the day, for towards evening everyone should be ready to receive the holy day in a quiet and serene frame of mind. The text for blessing the children is: <italic>Yesimecha</italic> [May God make you] etc., <italic>Yevarechecha</italic> [May God bless you] etc., and everyone may add to this prayer according to his eloquence of speech. It is proper to say also the following prayer: May it be the will of our Father in heaven to place in your heart love and fear of Him, and may the fear of God be upon your face all the days of your life, so that you will not sin. May your desire be for Torah and mitzvos. May your eyes look straightforward, may your mouth speak wisdom, and your heart meditate with reverence. May your hands be engaged in the performance of mitzvos; may your feet hasten to do the will of your Father in heaven. May He grant you righteous sons and daughters occupying themselves with Torah and mitzvos all their days. May your wellspring be blessed, [May you be blessed with many children]. May He grant that your livelihood, come with honesty, ease, and abundance, from His generous hand, and not from the gifts of men; a livelihood that will free you to serve God. May you be inscribed and sealed for a good and long life among all the righteous of Israel. Amein.</p>
<p>17) It is customary to put on the <italic>tallis</italic>. You should be careful to put it on while it is still day, and to say the berachah over it. But if you waited [to put it on] until twilight you should not say the berachah.</p>

<ftnote id="fn655">2. Where there are many chickens to be killed and a large number of people present, who pressure the <italic>shochet</italic> to do their chicken, it is best to do the <italic>kapparah</italic> ritual several days <italic>before Yom Kippur</italic>, rather than cause the <italic>shochet</italic> to kill the chicken improperly. He will be unable to inspect his knife properly before killing each chicken and this could cause the chicken to be <italic>treife</italic> (not kosher). It is also possible to avoid this problem by using money rather than chickens to do the <italic>kapporos</italic> ritual. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 605:2)</ftnote>

(<italic>Ibid</italic> 607:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn664">11. You should not lean on something when saying <italic>Vidui</italic>.

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 132 The Order of Yom Kippur Eve</title>
<p>1) It is the custom in our regions before saying <italic>Kol nidrei</italic> that the most eminent man of the congregation takes out a <italic>Seifer Torah</italic> [from the Ark]<sup><xref rid="fn675">1</xref></sup> and walks around the <italic>bimah</italic> with it and the people embrace and kiss the <italic>Seifer Torah</italic>, and beg for pardon and forgiveness for having offended the Torah. They resolve, from now on to live according to its laws. They recite the verse <italic>Or zaru&#x2019;a</italic> [Light is sown for the righteous] etc. a number of times (Psalms 97:11). Then he places himself, with the <italic>Seifer Torah</italic>, to the right of the <italic>Chazzan</italic>, and another prominent member of the congregation stands on the <italic>Chazzan&#x2019;s</italic> left, also carrying a <italic>Seifer Torah</italic>, and the three say together: <italic>Biyishivah shel malah</italic> [By the authority of the Court on High] etc. The <italic>Chazzan</italic> then recites <italic>Kol nidrei</italic> three times, in the familiar melody. All the congregants should say it quietly along with the <italic>Chazzan</italic>. It is proper to begin <italic>Kol nidrei</italic> while it is still day, and to draw it out until night.<sup><xref rid="fn676">2</xref></sup> After the <italic>Chazzan</italic> said <italic>Barechu</italic> and the congregation responded <italic>Baruch</italic> etc. the Torah scrolls are returned to the Ark, [and the two men who carried them] return to their seats. On Shabbos they may return to their seats when the congregation recites <italic>Mizmor shir leyom haShabbos</italic> [a Psalm, a song for the Shabbos day].</p>
<p>2) When the <italic>Chazzan</italic> says the berachah <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> he should have in mind to exempt the congregation. Nevertheless, each worshipper should have in mind not to be exempted by the <italic>Chazzans&#x2019;s</italic> berachah, but he should say the berachah quietly by himself, and say it quickly, concluding it before the <italic>Chazzan</italic>, so that he can respond Amein. The women who said the berachah <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> when lighting candles, or a man who lit the candles and said <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic>, should not say it with the <italic>Chazzan</italic>.</p>
<p>3) On <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, both in the evening and during the day, you should say, <italic>Baruch sheim kevod malchuso le&#x2019;olam va&#x2019;ed</italic>, [Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever], in a loud voice.</p>
<p>4) Some people stand on their feet<sup><xref rid="fn677">3</xref></sup> during the entire evening service and the entire day of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>. If they feel faint they may lean against something. The reason for standing is to emulate the angels; therefore, women should not stand. A person who has stood up once with the intention to do so for the rest of his life, and afterwards wishes to retract, needs an annulment [of his personal obligation].</p>
<p>5) Some people have the custom to stay in the synagogue reciting songs of praise all night.<sup><xref rid="fn678">4</xref></sup> When they feel the need to sleep<sup><xref rid="fn679">5</xref></sup> they should move away from the Ark. The <italic>Chazzanim</italic> should not stay awake for it will cause them to lose their voice. Before going to sleep you should say the first four Psalms,<sup><xref rid="fn680">6</xref></sup> for they are particularly beneficial in preventing nocturnal emission, may the Merciful One save us. For [these four Psalms] contain a total of three hundred and six words. By adding four, [to the number of the] Psalms, you arrive at a total of three hundred and ten, which is the numerical equivalence of <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;</span>, <italic>keri</italic>, [nocturnal emission]. [The numerical value] of the first and last letters of the four Psalms amounts to one hundred and twenty-six, plus the four of the four Psalms, plus one, the general binding factor which unites the word, together makes a total of one hundred and thirty-one, the numerical equivalence of <span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05DE;&#x05D0;&#x05DC;</span>, [malevolent angel] and you should have in mind to shake off his evil influence. It is best not to cover yourself with pillows and blankets that make you feel hot; but at any rate you should not cover your legs.</p>
<ftnote id="fn675">1. In some communities all the <italic>Sifrei Torah</italic> are taken, in others three are taken, and in some seven are taken.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn676">2. If it is still too early to recite the <italic>Kerias Shemah</italic>, the congregation should recite chapters from the Psalms until the proper time to recite <italic>Kerias Shemah</italic>. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 619;6)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn677">3. You must be sure that standing throughout the evening will not cause you to lose concentration of the prayers, because if it does inhibit your concentration, it is a sin to stand. Similarly if standing during the day will cause you to become tired and weak and disturb your concentration, it is a sin to stand. (<italic>Sha&#x2019;ar Hatzion</italic> 619:18)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn678">4. <italic>Levush</italic> writes that it is better to go home and sleep, for a person who is up all night will doze off by day and pray without proper concentration. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 619:14)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn679">5. It is not permitted to sleep in the synagogue, however, unless you actually intended to recite &#x201C;Songs of praise&#x201D; all night. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 619:6)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn680">6. This is in addition to the regular <italic>Kerias Shemah</italic> prayer that is recited at night. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 619:4)</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 133 Laws of Yom Kippur</title>
<p>1) On <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> it is forbidden to eat, to drink, to wash, to anoint, to wear shoes, and to have marital relations. It is forbidden to do any work or to carry, just as on Shabbos. Since it is necessary to add from the secular to the sacred, all of the above are forbidden [on <italic>erev Yom Kippur</italic>] while it is still day, beginning a short time before twilight; and at the end of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, until a short time after the stars appear.</p>
<p>2) Some authorities permit touching food or drink when it is necessary to feed the children, while others forbid it. If possible, you should be careful<sup><xref rid="fn681">1</xref></sup> [not to touch any food].</p>
<p>3) For the prohibition of washing, see chapter 124, paragraphs 7, 8 and 9. On <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> only washing for pleasure is forbidden (see also chapter 159). You should be very careful not to wash more than actually necessary. Since you spend the entire day in the synagogue engaged in prayer and hymns, you have probably kept your hands clean, and should not wash them for the <italic>Ne&#x2019;ilah, Minchah</italic> and <italic>Maariv</italic> services.<sup><xref rid="fn682">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>4) The <italic>kohanim</italic> who go up to bless the people, for <italic>Birkas Kohanim</italic> must wash their hands up to their wrists. If they did not wash their entire hands in the morning, but only their fingers, even though they said the berachah <italic>Al netilas yadayim</italic>, nevertheless, since this washing is not valid for <italic>Birkas Kohanim</italic>, they must wash their hands this time up to the wrists, and repeat the berachah <italic>Al netilas yadayim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn683">3</xref></sup> It is best that they should wash their hands in the morning up to the wrists, so they will not need to repeat the berachah.</p>
<p>5) A sick person, even one whose condition is not critical, may wash in the usual manner. A bride, within thirty days of her wedding day, may wash her face so that she should not look unattractive to her husband.<sup><xref rid="fn684">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) If someone has a nocturnal emission, God forbid, on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, if it is still moist, he should wipe it off with a cloth. If it has dried, he should wash only the soiled areas, for <italic>Halachah</italic> considers it as excrement. It should not be washed with a garment, so that he should not squeeze the garment by mistake. He is forbidden to immerse in a <italic>mikvah</italic>, even though he regularly immerses himself on the other days of the year. He should reveal his anguish to a Torah scholar and tell him what happened to him on this holy and awe-inspiring day, and he will instruct him what to do in order to be forgiven and live long.</p>
<p>7) Anointing is forbidden, even if only to remove dirt. Even to anoint only part of the body is forbidden. But a sick person, even if his condition is not critical, may anoint himself in the usual manner. In our regions, where people in normal health do not usually anoint themselves on weekdays, a person who has pimples is forbidden to anoint himself, because it is obvious he is doing it as a cure.</p>
<p>8) Some authorities forbid wearing even shoes made of wood that are not covered with leather; but shoes made of reed grass, or straw or cloth are permitted. You should be stringent and not wear shoes even when walking through mud and clay or in the rain. Even if you have to walk among non-Jews<sup><xref rid="fn685">5</xref></sup> it is forbidden to wear shoes. But if it is very painful for you to walk through mud and clay, or in the rain without shoes, you may wear shoes without heels, and if they have heels, you should change them around, putting the left shoe on the right foot<sup><xref rid="fn686">6</xref></sup> and the right shoe on the left foot, if there is a difference between them. Before the entrance of the synagogue you should take them off and put them away. You should be careful not to touch them with your hands either when putting them on or removing them, so that you will not have to wash your hands.</p>
<p>9) You are permitted to stand on a pillow or a pad, even if they are made of leather, but during the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic> it is forbidden to stand on anything. But a person who feels chilled may stand on some grass.</p>
<p>10) A person who is sick, even if his condition is not critical, or one who has an injured foot, or a woman within thirty days after childbirth, is permitted to wear shoes.<sup><xref rid="fn687">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>11) It is forbidden to touch your wife<sup><xref rid="fn688">8</xref></sup> even during the daytime; and you should consider her, as though she is menstrually unclean during the entire day of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>.</p>
<p>12) Pregnant and nursing women should fast the entire day, the same as other people. A nursing woman should not fast if her child is critically ill, and will not nurse from anyone else but her; for if she would fast, the child&#x2019;s life would be threatened.</p>
<p>13) It is an established fact, that if you do not give a pregnant woman<sup><xref rid="fn689">9</xref></sup> the food she craves, she and the child will be in danger. Therefore if she smelled food and it stimulated a craving for it, this precedure should be followed: If she says &#x201C;I must eat,&#x201D; even though her facial color has not changed, or if it did visibly change, even if she does not say anything, you should whisper in her ear that today is <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, because sometimes that will calm her. But if this does not calm her, she should be fed in the following manner: At first give her just a taste, by dipping your finger<sup><xref rid="fn690">10</xref></sup> in the soup, etc., and putting it into her mouth, because sometimes even one drop will calm her. But if that does not help, you should give her a little less than the <italic>halachic</italic> quantity, (see paragraph 15 below). If her mind still is not calmed, you should give her as much as she needs. The same applies to any person who caught a smell of food and his face turned [ashen]. Such a person is considered critically ill, (see chapter 33:4 above) and should be treated as I wrote [above]. But as long as his color has not changed you should not give him any food, even if he says &#x201C;I must eat.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn691">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>14) A woman who has given birth<sup><xref rid="fn692">12</xref></sup> or a person who is critically ill, with regard to eating, drinking and the desecration of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, are governed by the same <italic>Halochos</italic> that apply in the case of desecration of Shabbos. (see chapters 92 and 93 above) However, with regard to eating and drinking, even if several doctors say that the patient is not required [to take food,] and even if they say that eating and drinking will be harmful to him, but the patient says that he does require food, and even if he says that his life is not yet in danger, but if he does not eat, his sickness will get worse, and his life will be threatened, you should obey his wishes<sup><xref rid="fn693">13</xref></sup> and give him food; for in regard to food and drink he is the best judge of his own condition, [as it is written, (Proverbs 14:10)] &#x201C;The heart knows its own bitterness.&#x201D;</p>
<p>15) When you give food to a pregnant woman or to a woman who has given birth<sup><xref rid="fn694">14</xref></sup> or to a sick person, you should place the food before them, and say to them, &#x201C;If you feel that you may be in danger unless you eat as much as you need, then you may eat normally, until you are satisfied.<sup><xref rid="fn695">15</xref></sup> However if it is possible for you to eat only the halachic quantity at one time, then do as follows: Eat at one time a quantity the size of two-thirds of an egg.<sup><xref rid="fn696">16</xref></sup> (The quantity of food, for which a person is punished by <italic>kareis</italic> [premature death] [if he eats it] on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> is the size of a large date which is a little less than a medium-size egg with the shell.) Then take a short pause, and eat the same quantity again. The pause between eatings should be sufficiently long<sup><xref rid="fn697">17</xref></sup> so that from the end of one meal to the beginning of the next should be at least as long as the time needed for <italic>achilas peras</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn698">18</xref></sup> In this manner you may eat even many times, provided the interval between two meals is at least as long as <italic>achilas peras</italic><sup><xref rid="fn698">18</xref></sup> if you can wait that long, [and the small quantity] is sufficient for you. (Two meals that are separated by a lesser pause, are combined, and considered one meal.) With regard to drinking, you may drink at one time a little less than a mouthful,<sup><xref rid="fn699">19</xref></sup> pause a bit and drink again. These pauses should be at least as long as the time needed for <italic>achilas peras</italic>, or in any case at least [as long as it takes] to drink a <italic>reve&#x2019;is</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn696">16</xref></sup> Before Yom Kippur you should measure the lengths of these intervals by timing them with a [stop] watch, so that you will know them exactly.&#x201D;</p>
<p>16) If someone is overcome by a voracious, ravenous hunger, and he is famished to the point of being sick, his symptoms being weakening eyesight and impaired vision, you may give him food until he regains his clear eyesight.<sup><xref rid="fn700">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>17) All those who are given food because their health is in danger, if no permitted food is available, may be fed forbidden food. (see Shulchan Aruch 618:9) If they are given forbidden food, it seems that they should be fed less than a <italic>kazayis</italic><sup><xref rid="fn696">16</xref></sup> at a time if that is sufficient for them.</p>
<p>18) If your mind is at ease you should say a berachah before and after eating, but you should not recite <italic>kiddush</italic>. In <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> you should say <italic>Ya&#x2019;aleh veyavo</italic>, and if it occurs on Shabbos you should say <italic>Retzeih</italic>. But if you forgot to say it, you need not repeat <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, because it is not a mitzvah to eat bread on this day.</p>
<p>19) Even if boys and girls less than nine years old want to fast for a while, they should not be permitted to do so, because it may, God forbid, endanger their health. But when they are nine years old and in good health, they should be trained to fast a little, and they should not eat until a few hours past their regular mealtime. Concerning wearing shoes, washing and anointing, children should be trained [to abstain] even before they are nine years old.</p>
<p>20) It is a good practice to smell spices several times [during the day] and to say the berachah over them, in order to fulfill the required number of one hundred berachos a day. However, as long as your mind has not been diverted [from inhaling the fragrance], you are forbidden to repeat the berachah, for that would be a berachah in vain. It is necessary, therefore, to let a long time pass between inhalations in order that you be distracted. It is best to smell different spices each time, even if they are of the same species, and surely this is true if you have three different species such as fragrant woods, fragrant herbs, and spices, [each of which has a different berachah]. If you concentrate on all the <italic>berachos</italic> said by the <italic>Chazzan</italic>, and by those who are called to the Torah, and the two readings of the <italic>Haftarah</italic>, you will be missing only three <italic>berachos</italic> of the one hundred, and you will reach that number with the <italic>berachos</italic> you say over the spices.</p>
<p>21) <italic>Yizkor</italic>, the memorial service for the departed is recited on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, because remembering the departed saddens and humbles a man&#x2019;s heart, and for the additional reason, that the dead, too, need atonement, as expounded in <italic>Sifri:</italic> &#x201C;Forgive Your people Yisrael,&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 21:8) refers to the living, &#x201C;whom You have redeemed,&#x201D; refers to the dead, this teaches us that the dead need atonement. We pledge to give charity on their behalf, (see chapter 67:3 and when doing so you should say &#x201C;without making a vow&#x201D;). A support for this practice is found at the end of the portion of <italic>Tetzaveh</italic> (Exodus 30:10) where it is written, &#x201C;He shall make atonement once each year,&#x201D; and this is followed by the verse (verse 12) &#x201C;Each shall give an atonement offering to God.&#x201D; The charity is credited to the departed, because God, Who tests the hearts, knows that if this man were alive, he, too, would have given charity. The living can pray to make the judgment of the dead less severe, just as David did when he prayed for [his son] Absalom (<italic>Maseches Sotah</italic> 10b); and the righteous dead appeal to God on behalf of their offspring. Also on the last day of <italic>Pesach</italic>, on the second day of <italic>Shavuos</italic>, and on <italic>Shemini Atzeres, Yizkor</italic> is said, because on these days we read <italic>Kol habechor</italic> [Every male first-born], (Deuteronomy 15:19), where it is written, &#x201C;Each person according to the gift of his hand&#x201D; (16:17). Because of that, people pledge money for charity. Since pledges are made to charity, it became the accepted custom to make these pledges on behalf of the departed souls, that God may remember them for good, and that He may also remember us along with them for good, through their merits. It is customary for those whose father and mother are living to leave the synagogue during the <italic>Yizkor</italic> service. It is also the custom, during the first year after the death of one&#x2019;s father or mother to leave the synagogue [during <italic>Yizkor</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn701">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>22) If there is to be a <italic>bris</italic>, it should be performed before <italic>Ashrei</italic>. The berachah over the circumcision should be said without a cup of wine. In our regions it is customary to say the berachah over the cup of wine, and give a taste of it to the circumcised infant, in addition to what is given to him when saying <italic>Bedama&#x2019;yich cha&#x2019;yi</italic> [In your blood, live] (Ezekiel 16:6). But another child should not be given any of the wine, (for [the laws of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>] are more stringent than those of <italic>Tishah beAv</italic>.) [A mohel] who is accustomed to use wine when doing the <italic>metzitzah</italic> [sucking blood from the wound] should not spray the wine with his mouth but with his hand, and then suck the blood with his mouth in the usual manner.</p>
<p>23) It is customary to spread grass on the floor of the synagogue. The reason for this is, that you bow down and prostrate yourself during the <italic>Avodah</italic>, as a reminder of the service in the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, and in a place where the ground is covered with stone it is forbidden to bow down. Even in a place that is not tiled [with stone], it involves some prohibition. Therefore, grass is spread to form a separation between [you and] the ground. But if there is no grass, you should make the separation with your <italic>tallis</italic> or use something else.</p>
<p>24) The time for beginning the <italic>Ne&#x2019;ilah</italic> service is when the sun is over the tree-tops,<sup><xref rid="fn702">22</xref></sup> so that you will conclude it when the stars begin to appear. Sometimes, the <italic>Ne&#x2019;ilah</italic> service is drawn out into the night, but even so, you may say <italic>Chosmeinu</italic> [seal us], because the heavenly judgment is not concluded until Yisrael concludes the order of prayers below. If the stars have already come out the verse <italic>Hayom yifneh</italic> [The day is drawing to a close] etc. should not be said, because you would be speaking an untruth. You should say, instead, <italic>Hayom panah</italic> [the day has ended], <italic>hashemesh bo ufanah</italic> [the sun has set]. The <italic>Chazzan</italic> says <italic>Birkas Kohanim</italic> and <italic>Sim shalom</italic>, even though it is already night.</p>
<p>25) We should abolish the custom of having a non-Jew light candles for the purpose of saying the special poetic prayers in <italic>Ne&#x2019;ilah</italic>, but he should distribute the burning candles throughout the synagogue, because the prohibition involved in this is only a derivation of a Rabbinical injunction.</p>
<p>26) After the conclusion of <italic>Ne&#x2019;ilah</italic>, even if it is Shabbos, and <italic>Ne&#x2019;ilah</italic> ended while it is still daytime, nevertheless, we say <italic>Avinu Malkeinu</italic>. We then say <italic>&#x201C;Shema Yisrael&#x201D;</italic> one time, <italic>Baruch sheim kevod malchuso le&#x2019;olam va&#x2019;ed</italic>, [Blessed is His name, whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever] is said three times; <italic>Hashem hu haElokim</italic> [Hashem is God] is said seven times, to honor the departure of the Divine Presence as it ascends to the spiritual heights upward of above the seven heavens. The <italic>Chazzan</italic> then sings the whole kaddish with a joyous melody. After that,<sup><xref rid="fn703">23</xref></sup> one <italic>Tekiah</italic> is sounded on the <italic>shofar</italic>, as a sign that the <italic>Shechinah</italic> has risen on high, as was done at the Giving of the Torah. For when the <italic>Shechinah</italic> ascended, it is said, &#x201C;When the ram&#x2019;s horn is blown&#x201D; etc. (Exodus 19:13), and it is also said, &#x201C;God ascended amidst <italic>Teruah</italic> sounds.&#x201D; It is also a reminder of the blowing of the <italic>shofar</italic> on the <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> of the Jubilee Year. It is permitted to blow the <italic>shofar</italic> even though the stars have not yet appeared and it is still twilight, even on Shabbos. But when it is yet daytime, the <italic>shofar</italic> should not be blown. After the <italic>Tekiah</italic> everyone says three times,<sup><xref rid="fn704">24</xref></sup> <italic>Leshanah haba&#x2019;ah birushalayim</italic> [Next year [may we be] in Jerusalem].</p>
<p>27) After the stars have come out the <italic>Maariv</italic> service is said. A respected person should be chosen as <italic>Chazzan</italic>, and the prayers should be said slowly and intently. Those who pray in a hurry should be scolded. In the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic> you should say <italic>Ata chonantanu</italic> [You have favored us]. If <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> occurred on Shabbos you should say <italic>Veyiten lecha</italic> [May God give you], but you do not say <italic>Vihi no&#x2019;am</italic> [May the pleasantness] and <italic>Ve&#x2019;ata kadosh</italic> [You are the Holy One]. After the prayers, <italic>Kiddush levanah</italic> [Sanctification of the moon] is said, and people exchange good wishes with one another, with happiness and a glad heart, as on a Yom Tov.</p>
<p>28) In the <italic>Havdalah</italic> of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> night, you must say the berachah only over a candle that was lit before <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, and not over a light that is produced now by means of a match or something similar, nor over a light that has been lit from such a light. The best way is to light a candle from the flame of the candle you lit in your house the day before, and to say the berachah over both of them. If you have no burning candle in your house you should bring a burning candle from the synagogue, light another candle from it and say a berachah over both of them. In extreme circumstances, you may say the berachah over a candle that was lit from a candle of a non-Jew, or from a flame that was produced by means of a match, or something similar. You should not begin the <italic>Havdalah</italic> with <italic>Hinei keil yeshuasi</italic> [Behold the Almighty is my deliverance], [rather you should begin] and say the berachah over a cup of wine, over the candle, and then say <italic>Hamavdil</italic>. You should not say a berachah over spices. If it is Shabbos night you should say the berachah over spices, and then you also begin with <italic>Hinei keil yeshuasi</italic>, as on any other Shabbos night.</p>
<p>29) We eat and drink and we rejoice at the conclusion of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, as it is said in the <italic>Midrash</italic>, &#x201C;At the conclusion of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> a heavenly voice goes forth and says: &#x2018;Go, eat your bread with gladness, and drink your wine with a cheerful heart, for God has already accepted your deeds with favor.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>30) People who are meticulous in observing the mitzvos begin to build the <italic>sukkah</italic>, immediately after the end of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, fulfilling the verse, &#x201C;They go from strength to strength&#x201D; (Psalms 84:8).</p>
<p>31) On the day after <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> it is customary to rise early to go to the synagogue. On the days between <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> and <italic>Sukkos</italic>, we do not fast even the fast of a <italic>Yahrtzeit</italic>. We do not say <italic>Tachanun</italic> [on these days], because they are days of rejoicing during which the Altar was dedicated in the days of King Solomon, and also because we are occupied with the mitzvah of building the <italic>sukkah</italic>, and preparing the <italic>esrog</italic>, and the other species in honor of the Master of masters, the sanctifier of Yisrael and the seasons.</p>
<ftnote id="fn681">1. According to <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> it is not necessary to be stringent even if the child is able to take the food by himself. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 612:32)</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn683">3. According to <italic>Eliyohu Rabbah</italic>, the <italic>Kohanim</italic> need never say the berachah on washing their hands [and certainly on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> they should not say it]. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 128:24)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn684">4. According to <italic>Chayei Adam</italic> this does not apply in our times, since the entire day is spent in the synagogue and her husband will not have the opportunity of seeing her. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 613:26)</ftnote>

If, however, a person is actually ill or if the doctor says he must eat, we should give him food immediately according to his needs. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 617:6)</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 134 The Laws of the Sukkah</title>
<p>1) It is a mitzvah to build the <italic>sukkah</italic> immediately, on the day after <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn705">1</xref></sup> even if it is <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn706">2</xref></sup> because when a mitzvoh presents itself you should not put it off. You should select a clean location to build it.<sup><xref rid="fn707">3</xref></sup> It is a mitzvah for everyone to be personally involved in building the <italic>sukkah</italic> and laying the <italic>sechach</italic> (covering). Even though he is a distinguished person, it is considered an honor to be personally involved in the mitzvah. It would have been appropriate to say the berachah <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> when building the <italic>sukkah</italic>, but we rely on the <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> that is said in the <italic>Kiddush</italic>. You should endeaver to decorate the <italic>sukkah</italic> and to adorn it with beautiful things and elegant spreads, according to your means.</p>
<p>2) Concerning the walls of the <italic>sukkah</italic>, there are many different <italic>halachos</italic>, and not everyone is familiar with them. Therefore, you must make the walls full-length (complete) and strong, so that the wind cannot shake them<sup><xref rid="fn708">4</xref></sup> or blow out the candles. If you do not have enough [lumber] for [four] walls, it is better to make three complete walls than four incomplete ones. If you can afford it, it is a mitzvah to build a <italic>sukkah</italic> with a roof, that can open and close on hinges, so that you can close it when it rains; and when the rain is over, you can open it again. This way, the <italic>sechach</italic> is kept dry, and you can fulfill the mitzvah of <italic>sukkah</italic> properly.</p>
<p>3) With regard to <italic>sechach</italic>, there are also many <italic>halachos</italic>. It is our custom to cover the <italic>sukkah</italic> with branches of trees or with reeds. Since they grow in the earth, and are detached from the soil, and do not absorb ritual impurity, and are not tied together, you have no reason at all to hesitate [using them].</p>
<p>4) Initially, you should be stringent, and avoid placing anything that absorbs ritual impurity to serve as a supporting beam for the <italic>sechach</italic>, such as ladders which have [in their side pieces] holes in which the rungs are inserted, and certainly other utensils, such as a spade or a rake. Even placing them on top of the <italic>sechach</italic> to reinforce it, should be avoided. However, if they are in place already, or you have nothing else [to serve the purpose], all these are permitted for we have an established rule that it is permitted to support the <italic>sechach</italic> with something that absorbs ritual impurity.</p>
<p>5) You must put enough <italic>sechach</italic> on the <italic>sukkah</italic> to provide more shade than sun,<sup><xref rid="fn709">5</xref></sup> for if there is more sun than shade, the <italic>sukkah</italic> is invalid, according to Torah law. Care must be taken, therefore, to put on enough <italic>sechach</italic>; that, even if it dries out, there will still be more shade than sun. You must also be careful not to leave an open space of three <italic>tefachim</italic> in any one place.<sup><xref rid="fn710">6</xref></sup> Initially, it is necessary to leave a slight space between the branches of the <italic>sukkah</italic>, so that the stars can be seen. Nevertheless, if the <italic>sechach</italic> is so thick that the stars cannot be seen, the <italic>sukkah</italic> is still valid. But if the <italic>sechach</italic> is so thick, that even a heavy rain cannot come through, then it is almost like a house, and the <italic>sukkah</italic> is invalid.<sup><xref rid="fn711">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) When <italic>sukkos</italic> are solidly constructed, sometimes boards jut out along the top of the walls, and on these boards, the beams are placed on which the <italic>sechach</italic> rests. If this board is less than four <italic>amos</italic><sup><xref rid="fn712">8</xref></sup> wide, the <italic>sukkah</italic> does not become invalid, because of invalid <italic>sechah</italic>, for there is a <italic>halachic</italic> tradition from Mount Sinai, that when a board projects less than four <italic>amos</italic>, we say that it is a curved wall, which means that the protruding board is considered part of the wall, and we regard the wall as if it is bent at the top.<sup><xref rid="fn713">9</xref></sup> But you may not sit or sleep underneath that board, for <italic>Halachah</italic> does not recognize that area as part of the <italic>sukkah</italic>, even if the board is only four <italic>tefachim</italic> wide; but the rest of the <italic>sukkah</italic> is valid. But if protruding from the <italic>sukkah</italic> wall, there are boards that are four <italic>amos</italic> or more wide, then they are called invalid <italic>sechach</italic> which invalidates the entire <italic>sukkah</italic>. Nevertheless, if the boards protrude into the <italic>sukkah</italic> only on one side, as is the style in some of the built [permanent] <italic>sukkos</italic>, where a small shelf is installed on one side (to put the dishes there when it starts to rain), then it does not matter; since it is only on one side, there are still three valid walls on which there is valid <italic>sechach;</italic> and a <italic>sukkah</italic> made of three walls is also valid, provided it has the minimum size required for a <italic>sukkah</italic>, which is no less than seven <italic>tefachim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn714">10</xref></sup> by seven <italic>tefachim</italic> square. But you must not sit underneath the shelf.</p>
<p>7) If you build a <italic>sukkah</italic> underneath the branches of a tree<sup><xref rid="fn715">11</xref></sup> it is invalid. Even if the branches alone would have allowed more sun than shade, and consequently, by placing the <italic>sechach</italic> on the <italic>sukkah</italic>, you, in fact, made it into a <italic>sukkah</italic> [by providing the required shade], it is, nevertheless, invalid. Even if you cut off the branches of the tree afterwards, the <italic>sukkah</italic> still remains invalid, for it is written, &#x201C;Make [<italic>ta&#x2019;aseh</italic>] the festival of <italic>Sukkos</italic> for yourself&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 16:13), and it is expounded, &#x201C;A <italic>sukkah</italic> must be made, and not come into being by itself.&#x201D; (see chapter 9:6 above) Therefore, after cutting the branches of the tree, you must pick up each branch of the <italic>sechach</italic> and a new act of placing it down must be performed, for the purpose of fulfilling the mitzvah of <italic>sukkah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn716">12</xref></sup> It is also forbidden to lay down the <italic>sechach</italic> before making the walls for it is required that with the laying of the <italic>sechach</italic> the <italic>sukkah</italic> should become valid for use.</p>
<p>8) Similarly when you build a <italic>sukkah</italic> with a roof that can be opened [and closed], you must open the roof before you put down the <italic>sechach</italic>, and if afterwards you close the roof and open it again, it does not matter, for it is the same as if you spread a sheet over it and then remove it. Nevertheless, you should be stringent, and have the roof open at the onset of the Yom Tov. You must also take care with these <italic>sukkos</italic> that the roof is wide open, straight in line with the wall of the <italic>sukkah</italic>. For if it is not perfectly straight, but inclines slightly over the <italic>sechach</italic>, even if the area covered is not large enough to make the <italic>sukkah</italic> invalid, nevertheless, you should be careful not to sit under the area over which the roof protrudes, for you would then be sitting underneath the roof. (see paragraph 6 above) Although a <italic>sukkah</italic> is exempt from a <italic>mezuzah</italic> during the Yom Tov, nevertheless, the permanently built <italic>sukkos</italic>, that are used all year and are required to have a <italic>mezuzah</italic>, are not exempt during <italic>Sukkos</italic>, and it is not necessary after <italic>Sukkos</italic> to affix the <italic>mezuzah</italic> again.</p>
<p>9) You may fulfill your obligation with a borrowed <italic>sukkah</italic>, but not with a <italic>sukkah</italic> that was stolen. It is forbidden, therefore, to build a <italic>sukkah</italic> in a public domain. In extreme situations when there is no other <italic>sukkah</italic> available under any circumstance you may sit in it and say the berachah in it.</p>
<p>10) You should be careful not to cut the <italic>sechach</italic> for your <italic>sukkah</italic> yourself, but you should buy it from someone else. In exterme situations, you may cut it yourself, but you should get permission from the owner of the land.</p>
<p>11) You are permitted to build a <italic>sukkah</italic> during <italic>Chol Hamo&#x2019;ed</italic>.</p>
<p>12) The wood of the <italic>sukkah</italic>, either of the walls or of the <italic>sechach</italic>, is forbidden to be used [for any purpose] until after <italic>Simchas Torah</italic>, because they were set aside for the performance of a mitzvah. Even to take a splinter from it to use as a toothpick is forbidden. Even if [a piece of wood] fell down you are forbidden to use it; and it is of no avail [if you had made] a stipulation [before Yom Tov] [to use such wood.] If <italic>Simchas Torah</italic> occurs on Friday, the wood is forbidden also on Shabbos. The <italic>sukkah</italic> decorations are also forbidden to be used, even if they fell down. Since it is forbidden to derive any benefit from them, consequently, on Shabbos and Yom Tov it is forbidden to handle them because they are <italic>muktzeh</italic>. Nevertheless, if an <italic>esrog</italic> is hanging in the <italic>sukkah</italic> as a decoration, you are permitted to inhale its fragrance, for it was not set aside in regard to its fragrance. With regard to decorations hanging from the <italic>sechach</italic>, it is generally accepted that even if you made a stipulation [to use them on Yom Tov], it is of no avail. However, regarding decorations hanging on the walls, this stipulation is effective. Tapestries that are hung in the <italic>sukkah</italic> as decorations, it is the accepted practice to remove them so that they should not get ruined by an impending rain, even if you had made no express stipulation; for we assume that initially you had that in mind when you hung them.<sup><xref rid="fn717">13</xref></sup> Nevertheless, it is best to express prior stipulation, that is, before twilight on the eve of <italic>Sukkos</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn718">14</xref></sup> you should stand [in the <italic>sukkah</italic>] and say, &#x201C;I hereby stipulate that I am permitted to eat, and to use the decorations of this <italic>sukkah</italic> whenever I wish.&#x201D; You must be careful about those <italic>sukkah</italic> decorations that you intend to remove during Yom Tov, not to tie them with a knot, but only with a loop, (see chapter 80:45, 46 above).</p>
<p>13) Even after <italic>Sukkos</italic>, when you dismantle the <italic>sukkah</italic>, you should not step on the boards, and you should not use them in a degrading manner,<sup><xref rid="fn719">15</xref></sup> because they are articles that were used for a mitzvah, the same as <italic>tzitzis</italic>. (see chapter 9:19)</p>
<p>14) It is forbidden to carve out the verse &#x201C;You must live in <italic>sukkos</italic>&#x201D; etc. or any other verse on a pumpkin or similar fruit as a <italic>sukkah</italic> decoration, because it will subsequently be degraded, and besides, it is forbidden to write a verse needlessly.</p>
<p>15) On <italic>erev Sukkos</italic>, after midday you should not eat bread, so that you will eat your meal in the <italic>sukkah</italic> with good appetite. You should give generous amounts of charity on <italic>erev sukkos</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn705">1. Even though it was mentioned in the previous chapter (Paragraph 30) that it is a mitzvah to begin building the <italic>sukkah</italic> immediately after <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> at night, it is sufficient to make a symbolic beginning at night, whereas on the next day you should erect the entire <italic>sukkah</italic> if possible. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 652:2)</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 135 Laws of Dwelling in the Sukkah</title>
<p>1) It is written &#x201C;For seven days <italic>teishvu</italic> in <italic>sukkos</italic>,&#x201D; (Leviticus 23:42), which means &#x201C;you must dwell&#x201D; in <italic>sukkos</italic>. The Torah teaches that you should make the <italic>sukkah</italic> your home for seven days. Just as you live in your home all year, so now [on <italic>Sukkos</italic>] the <italic>sukkah</italic> should be your principal residence. There you should bring your fine china and elegant tablecloths. You should eat, drink, study,<sup><xref rid="fn720">1</xref></sup> spend your leisure, and sleep in the <italic>sukkah</italic>. Even conversation with friends<sup><xref rid="fn721">2</xref></sup> should be held in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, and if you pray alone<sup><xref rid="fn722">3</xref></sup> you should also pray in the <italic>sukkah</italic>. It is written, &#x201C;This is so that future generations will know that I caused the Israelites to live in <italic>sukkos</italic> when I brought them out of Egypt,&#x201D; (Leviticus 23:43). Therefore, you should keep in mind when you live in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, that the Holy One, blessed is He, commanded us to live in the <italic>sukkah</italic> as a memorial of the Exodus from Egypt. Regarding the <italic>sukkos</italic> of which the verse says &#x201C;That I caused [the Israelites] to live in <italic>sukkos</italic>, there is disagreement among <italic>Taanaim</italic>. Rabbi Eliezer says that it refers to the Clouds of Glory with which the Holy One, blessed is He, surrounded our forefathers, to shield them from the heat and the sun. Rabbi Akiva, says that it means actual <italic>sukkos</italic> that they built for themselves when they camped [in the desert] as a protection from the sun. Although we departed from Egypt in the month of <italic>Nisan</italic>, He did not command us to build the <italic>sukkah</italic> during that season, because it is the beginning of the summer, when people usually build booths for the shade, and it would not be recognized as being built in order to fulfill the mitzvah of the Creator, blessed is His Name. He, therefore, commanded us to make it in the seventh month, which is the rainy season, when people usually move out of their booths to live in their homes; but we move out of our houses to live in the <italic>sukkah</italic>; which makes it clear to all that we are fulfilling the King&#x2019;s command.</p>
<p>2) You should maintain the <italic>sukkah</italic> with dignity so that <italic>mitzvos</italic> should not be treated with disrespect. Therefore, you should not bring into it vessels that are unbecoming to a <italic>sukkah</italic>, such as pots, pitchers used for drawing water, vessels in which you keep flour, kneading troughs, kettles, frying pans, mortars, or similar utensils. After the meal, the dishes should be cleared away from the <italic>sukkah</italic>, but drinking glasses may remain in the <italic>sukkah</italic>. People usually do not bring earthen candlesticks into the <italic>sukkah</italic> because they are repulsive. You should not do undignified work in the <italic>sukkah</italic> like washing pots and dishes. But you are allowed to rinse a wine cup. Of course, it is forbidden to urinate there, even in a vessel, even if one usually does so in his house. But marital relations are permitted in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, for the underlying principle of the mitzvah is for husband and wife to be together. If you bring offensive vessels into the <italic>sukkah</italic> it does not become invalid, but while they are there you should not say the berachah <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>, until they have been removed.</p>
<p>3) Eating in the <italic>sukkah</italic> on the first night of <italic>Sukkos</italic>, is an obligation. It is required that you eat in the <italic>sukkah</italic> not less than a <italic>kazayis</italic> of bread;<sup><xref rid="fn723">4</xref></sup> and even if you suffer discomfort you are obligated to eat it in the <italic>sukkah</italic>. If it rains, (see paragraph 9 below) and it seems that it will stop in an hour or two, you should wait and then say the <italic>Kiddush</italic><sup><xref rid="fn724">5</xref></sup> and eat in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, in the appropriate way. But if it appears that the rain is not stopping, or you waited and it did not stop, then you should say the <italic>Kiddush</italic> in the <italic>sukkah</italic> and say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic>, and have in mind when saying <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> that this berachah also applies to the <italic>sukkah</italic>, but you should not say <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>. You then wash your hands and say <italic>Hamotzi</italic> and eat a <italic>kazayis</italic> of bread in the <italic>sukkah</italic> without interruption; and then go into your house to complete the meal. You should bear in mind when washing your hands and when saying <italic>Hamotzi</italic> that you also intend to eat in the house. (See chapter 42:19, 21 below) If it stops raining before you said <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, you should go back to the <italic>sukkah</italic>, say the berachah <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>, eat slightly more than a <italic>kebeitzah</italic> of bread,<sup><xref rid="fn725">6</xref></sup> and say <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>. If it stops raining after you said <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, you should also return to the <italic>sukkah</italic>, wash your hands again, eat more than a <italic>kebeitzah</italic> of bread, saying the berachah <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>, and then say <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>. If after the rain has stopped, water is still dripping from the <italic>sechach</italic> in your own <italic>sukkah</italic>, and there is a <italic>sukkah</italic> in your neighborhood that was closed with a roof, and after the rain they opened it, you should go there and eat your meal in good spirits.</p>
<p>4) On the second night of <italic>Sukkos</italic> it is also mandatory to eat in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, even if you suffer discomfort. It is governed by the same <italic>halachos</italic> that apply to the first night, as we have written, except for one difference, that if it appears that the rain is not going to stop, or if you waited and it did not stop, you should recite the <italic>Kiddush</italic> in the house and eat your meal there, and before saying <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, you should go to the <italic>sukkah</italic> and eat at least a <italic>kazayis</italic> of bread without saying <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>. You then return to the house and say <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>.</p>
<p>5) In the evening, on returning from the synagogue you should enter the <italic>sukkah</italic> and immediately say the <italic>Kiddush</italic>, but you should not say <italic>Kiddush</italic> unless you are sure that it is night. When you say <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic> you should be mindful to exempt with this berachah, the meal you are eating now, your sleeping [in the <italic>sukkah</italic>], and other necessities you will do in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, until you say <italic>Kiddush</italic> again the next morning. When saying <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> you should be mindful that this berachah applies to the Yom Tov as well as to the <italic>sukkah</italic>. Therefore, on the first night you should say first <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>, and then <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic>, so that the <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> applies to the <italic>sukkah</italic> as well; but on the second night you should first say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> and then <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn726">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) When several heads of families eat in one <italic>sukkah</italic> and there are also women, and other members of the family who must listen attentively to the <italic>Kiddush</italic> in order to fulfill their obligation; and, if all the men recite the <italic>Kiddush</italic> at the same time since two voices cannot be heard simultaneously, [their voices would become unintelligible,] and the family members would not hear the <italic>Kiddush</italic> clearly. It is best, therefore, that they should say the <italic>Kiddush</italic> one at a time. If they do recite the <italic>Kiddush</italic> simultaneously, [for example] in a situation when there is no one who has to fulfill his obligation by listening to the <italic>Kiddush;</italic> then if one of them finished saying the berachah <italic>Borei peri hagafen</italic>, or one of the other berachos, before the others, then the one who finishes early should not respond <italic>Amein</italic> to the berachah of the other, because saying <italic>Amein</italic> constitutes an interruption between the <italic>Borei peri hagafen</italic> [he just now said] and the drinking of the wine. Some people are accustomed to wait for the others to finish the <italic>Kiddush</italic> and to respond <italic>Amein</italic>. This is not according to <italic>Halachah;</italic> but they should all say it together.</p>
<p>7) On the other nights and days of <italic>Sukkos</italic>, you are not obligated to eat in the <italic>sukkah;</italic> but if you want to eat a regular meal or to sleep, you must do so in the <italic>sukkah</italic>. What is meant by a &#x201C;regular meal?&#x201D; If you eat more than a <italic>kebeitzah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn727">8</xref></sup> of bread, even if you do not schedule it as a &#x201C;meal,&#x201D; and even if it is pastry, [similar to a blintz or a strudel it must be eaten in the sukkah]. Similarly, any dish made of [one of] the five species of grain, if it is more than a <italic>kebeitzah</italic> and you scheduled it as a &#x201C;meal,&#x201D; you must eat it in the <italic>sukkah</italic> and say the berachah <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>. But even if you eat a large quantity of fruit and you scheduled it as a meal, you are allowed to eat the fruit outside the <italic>sukkah</italic>. Also wine or other beverages, or meat and cheese may be eaten and drunk outside the <italic>sukkah</italic>, provided you do not schedule it as a meal. But if you want to drink wine or other beverages as a scheduled &#x201C;meal,&#x201D; or you want to eat meat or cheese as a scheduled &#x201C;meal,&#x201D; you must have it in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, but without saying the berachah <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>. It is best to eat some bread first, so that you can say the berachah. All this is as required by <italic>Halachah</italic>, but those who are more meticulous and do not even drink water outside the <italic>sukkah</italic> are considered praiseworthy.</p>
<p>8) Sleeping, or even taking a nap, according to <italic>Halachah</italic>, must be in the <italic>sukkah</italic>. And this is the practice of those who are scrupulous in observing the mitzvos; they, indeed, do not even take a nap outside the <italic>sukkah</italic>. But nowadays, many people are lenient with regard to sleeping [in the <italic>sukkah</italic>]. The later authorities, of blessed memory, wrote a number of reasons to justify this leniency to an extent. However, every God-fearing person, should be stringent and build a <italic>sukkah</italic> in which he and his wife can dwell in the same manner they live the entire year, if possible. At minimum, [the <italic>sukkah</italic>] should be suitable for him to sleep in, for if it does not meet these standards it is not valid, even post factum<sup><xref rid="fn728">9</xref></sup> [even after it was already built].</p>
<p>9) If it rains, you are exempt from [staying in] the <italic>sukkah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn729">10</xref></sup> How heavy a rain must it be for you to be exempt? If it rains so much, that in your judgment, if that much rain would drip into your cooked food,<sup><xref rid="fn730">11</xref></sup> it would be spoiled, even if the food is not actually in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, or if you estimate,<sup><xref rid="fn731">12</xref></sup> that if it would rain that much into the room where you are sitting, you would move into another room, then you may leave the <italic>sukkah</italic> and go into the house. If you started to eat in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, and then it began to rain, so that you went into the house and started to eat there; or because of the rain you began initially to eat in the house, and then it stopped raining, you may finish your meal in the house, and you are not obligated to leave while the meal is in progress, to go from your house into the <italic>sukkah</italic>. When it is so cold that the food in the <italic>sukkah</italic> jells,<sup><xref rid="fn732">13</xref></sup> you are exempt from sitting in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, and you may eat in the house.<sup><xref rid="fn733">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>10) As for sleeping in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, even a slight rain causes discomfort when you sleep, and you may leave [the <italic>sukkah</italic> when it rains]. If you left the <italic>sukkah</italic> to sleep in the house, and then it stopped raining; or if you initially went to sleep in the house because of the rain and then the rain stopped, you do not have to bother to go to the <italic>sukkah</italic> during the night,<sup><xref rid="fn734">15</xref></sup> but you may sleep in the house until morning.</p>
<p>11) Anyone who is exempt from staying in the <italic>sukkah</italic> and does not leave is called a simpleton, and will receive no reward for it. And he is not permitted to say the berachah [<italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>], because it would be a berachah said in vain. When you leave the <italic>sukkah</italic> because of rain, you should not complain [in anger] as you leave, but go out feeling humbled, like a servant who poured a cup [of wine] for his master, and the master poured a pitcher [of water] into his face.</p>
<p>12) It is the custom to say the berachah <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic> only when you eat a regular meal.<sup><xref rid="fn735">16</xref></sup> And it is the custom to say the <italic>Hamotzi</italic> first, and then <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>, before you begin to eat. Everything that you eat in the <italic>sukkah</italic> the entire day, and whatever you do while staying there, even if you sleep there, is exempt with the berachah you said before eating the regular meal, [and it exempts everything] until you eat your next regular meal. If you did not leave the <italic>sukkah</italic> to go to business or to the synagogue between meals, since you once said the berachah, you need not repeat it at the next meal. Even if during the entire week of <italic>Sukkos</italic>, you would dwell in the <italic>sukkah</italic> eating, studying, praying and sleeping there, you would need to say the berachah only one time, because your thoughts were never diverted from the <italic>sukkah</italic>. Even if you left the <italic>sukkah</italic> temporarily, with the intention of returning immediately, it is not considered a diversion, and you need not say the berachah at the following meal. However, if you went out to do business, or to go to the synagogue, or for similar reasons; even if you went into your house to study, or to do something which is time consuming, it also constitutes a distraction, and you must say the berachah at the next meal.</p>
<p>13) If you leave the <italic>sukkah</italic> even in the middle of your meal, to go to a friend&#x2019;s <italic>sukkah</italic>, and you eat a quantity of food which must be eaten in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, you must say <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic> there too.<sup><xref rid="fn736">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>14) If you forgot to say <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>, and you become aware of it in the middle of the meal, or even after you finished the meal, you must still say the berachah, because by staying in the <italic>sukkah</italic> after the meal you are also fulfilling the mitzvah.</p>
<p>15) Women are exempt from the mitzvah of <italic>sukkah</italic>, nevertheless, they are permitted to say the berachah. Children also, are exempt, Nevertheless, if a boy is five years and over, his father must train him to eat in the <italic>sukkah</italic>. Even if the father is not at home, he should not be permitted to eat outside the <italic>sukkah</italic>.</p>
<p>16) A sick person and his attendants are exempt from the mitzvah of <italic>sukkah</italic>. However, if the patient is not critically ill, the attendants are exempt only when he needs them. If he is critically ill, they are exempt even when he does not need them so urgently.</p>
<p>17) [If staying in the <italic>sukkah</italic>] causes you discomfort, that is if you are troubled by the cold weather or the wind, or by a bad odor or similar annoyances, you are exempt from the mitzvah of <italic>sukkah</italic> on all nights other [than the first night], and on all the days of <italic>Sukkos</italic>. Similarly, if the light in the <italic>sukkah</italic> went out on Shabbos, and it is a great bother for you to go to a friend&#x2019;s <italic>sukkah</italic>, then you may go to your house, if the candles are burning there. This only applies if initially you made your <italic>sukkah</italic> properly, and it was only an accident that caused you to be uncomfortable while sitting or sleeping there. But if initially you made the <italic>sukkah</italic> in a place where there is an offensive odor, or similar [irritation], or in a place where you are afraid to sleep, then you cannot fulfill your obligation even when you eat there in the daytime. If the wind threatens to blow out the candles [on Shabbos], as it passes through the walls, you are permitted to spread a sheet or a garment on the wall.</p>
<p>18) People traveling in the daytime<sup><xref rid="fn737">18</xref></sup> are exempt from eating in the <italic>sukkah</italic> during the day,<sup><xref rid="fn738">19</xref></sup> because they have no time to look for a <italic>sukkah</italic>, since they must move along.<sup><xref rid="fn739">20</xref></sup> But if they are able to sit in a <italic>sukkah</italic> without too much trouble, they are obligated to do so. At night, when they are at the lodging where they intend to stay overnight, they must make an effort to [find] a <italic>sukkah</italic> in which to dwell. Even if they are in a place where there is no <italic>sukkah</italic>, if they can make one at a small cost,<sup><xref rid="fn740">21</xref></sup> they must endeavor to have a <italic>sukkah</italic> for sleeping. If they are also traveling at night they are governed by the same <italic>Halachos</italic> that apply in the daytime. People who travel to villages on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic> to collect debts, and cannot make a <italic>sukkah</italic> there, must assume the inconvenience of returning home every night in order to fulfill the mitzvah of <italic>sukkah</italic>.</p>
<p>19) People traveling for the sake of doing a mitzvah,<sup><xref rid="fn741">22</xref></sup> and would find it bothersome to find a <italic>sukkah</italic>, or if it is not convenient for them to sleep in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, and if they would sleep there they would be tired the next morning, and would be hampered in the performance of the mitzvah, are exempt from the mitzvah of <italic>sukkah;</italic> otherwise, they are obligated to fulfill it.</p>
<p>20) If watchmen who guard gardens, orchards, grain and other produce, find it possible to watch everything from one location, they should make a <italic>sukkah</italic> there, in which to stay.</p>
<p>21) Men who make wine in non-Jewish areas are exempt of the mitzvah of <italic>sukkah</italic>, whether by day or by night, because they must watch continuously that a non-Jew should not touch the wine. But if the situation is such that no watching is needed, then they are required to stay in the <italic>sukkah</italic>.</p>
<p>22) People who stay in a store, even if they live out of town, and the store is in town, and during the year they eat most of their daily meals there, nevertheless, on <italic>Sukkos</italic> they are required to eat in the <italic>sukkah</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn720">1. You must study Torah in the <italic>sukkah</italic> only if you are able to concentrate with total peace of mind. However, when because of cold weather you are unable to remain there for an extended period, to study with concentration, you are exempt, and may study in your home or in the <italic>Beis Midrash</italic>. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 639:29)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn721">2. However, because of the sacred nature of the <italic>sukkah</italic>, you must be very careful not to speak about forbidden subjects, gossip or slander. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 639:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn722">3. If however there is a synagogue in your area, you must leave the <italic>sukkah</italic> and attend the synagogue because during the rest of the year, you also leave your house to pray in the synagogue. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 639:30)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn723">4. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> rules that if you have sufficient bread, you should eat at least a <italic>kebeitzah</italic> (see glossary) in order to fulfill the mitzvah even according to those authorities who maintain that a <italic>kebeitzah</italic> is the minimum amount that must be eaten. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 639:22)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn724">5. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> rules that if you are distraught through hunger, or lack of sleep because of waiting, and certainly if you have poor guests at your table who probably have not eaten all day and are famished, you should not wait. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 639:35)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn725">6. If you eat less than this amount you must not say the berachah <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>. (<italic>Shaar Hatzion</italic> 639:69)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn726">7. There are other authorities who rule that <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic> is recited first on both nights. However, if several people eat together in the same <italic>sukkah</italic>, everyone should follow the same custom. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 661:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn727">8. See glossary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn728">9. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> writes, &#x201C;In places where the climate is cold [during this time of year], you still fulfill your obligation by eating in the <italic>sukkah</italic> even though you are unable to sleep there. Since it is impossible otherwise, it is therefore considered that you are living in the <italic>sukkah</italic> in the same manner as in your home. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 640:18, 20)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn729">10. However, if the rain does not drip through to the place where you are sitting, you must remain in the <italic>sukkah</italic> until it rains on you and on the table where you are sitting. It is also possible that you are even obligated to say the berachah <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic> under these circumstances. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 639:33)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn730">11. This is true even if the food is of the kind that spoils quickly because of a little water. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 639:34)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn731">12. If you are unable to make such a judgment, you should use the next example quoted in the text as a criterion. (<italic>Ramah</italic> 639:5)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn732">13. This is certainly true if you are troubled because of the cold. (<italic>Shaar Hatzion</italic> 639:59)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn733">14. This <italic>halachah</italic> also holds true if the climate is so intensely hot or if there are many insects that cause you to be uncomfortable, or will cause the food to become inedible. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 639:31)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn734">15. You need not go into the <italic>sukkah</italic> to sleep even if you wake up during the night. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 639:32)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn735">16. It is the custom of many not to say the berachah until they eat the meal even though they gather in the <italic>sukkah</italic> and sit there for an hour or so before eating. The rationale is that the berachah which will be said at mealtime exempts even the time spent in the <italic>sukkah</italic> before the meal. The later <italic>Poskim</italic>, however, write that in order to comply with those <italic>halachic</italic> authorities who maintain that it is not proper to sit for a length of time without saying the berachah, it is best to say the berachah <italic>Borei minei mezonos</italic> and eat a piece of cake larger than a <italic>kebeitzah</italic> as soon as you enter the <italic>sukkah</italic> and to say the berachah <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>. This will make it unnecessary to say the berachah when you eat the regular meal. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 639:46)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn736">17. Many later <italic>Poskim</italic> maintain that this is not considered an interruption if you had intended to go to another <italic>sukkah</italic> when you initially said the berachah, and that it is not necessary to say another berachah in the second <italic>sukkah</italic>. <italic>Beis Meir</italic> writes that you need not say another berachah even if you had no intention to eat in another <italic>sukkah</italic>. In situations where there is a doubt regarding <italic>berachos</italic>, the rule is that we are lenient and do not say the berachah. It is the best practice, therefore, not to leave the <italic>sukkah</italic> in the middle of the meal. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 639:48)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn737">18. According to <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic>, you need not curtail your travel even if you know that you will not find a <italic>sukkah</italic> enroute. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 640:42)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn738">19. You need not delay eating until you are able to find a <italic>sukkah</italic>. Needless to say, however, if there is a <italic>sukkah</italic> nearby, that you can use without too much bother, you are not exempt, and you must eat in the <italic>sukkah</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 640:42)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn739">20. This rule applies only to those traveling for business. However those who travel for pleasure are forbidden to travel to places where they will have no <italic>sukkah</italic>. (<italic>Igros Moshe, Orach Chaim</italic>, volume III Responsa 93.)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn740">21. This is not an actual obligation but those who do so will be blessed. If you intend to remain at any one place for three or four days, you must then make a <italic>sukkah</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 640:44)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn741">22. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> citing Responsa of <italic>Chasam Sofer</italic> writes that this is true only if the mission is one hundred percent for the purpose of fulfilling a mitzvah. If, however, there is any personal gain of pleasure involved, there is no exemption. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 640:7, <italic>Biur Halachah</italic>)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 136 Laws of the Lulav and the other Species</title>
<p>1) It is a time-honored custom in Yisrael that when you buy an <italic>esrog</italic> and a <italic>lulav</italic>, and you are not an expert in these <italic>Halachos</italic>, you should show it to an halachic authority to determine if they are valid, because there are many different <italic>Halachos</italic> regarding them. You should do your best to buy a fresh <italic>lulav</italic>, because a dry <italic>lulav</italic> may be used only in extreme circumstances.<sup><xref rid="fn742">1</xref></sup> Some authorities say,<sup><xref rid="fn743">2</xref></sup> that [a <italic>lulav</italic>] that is no longer green is considered dry. The required length of a <italic>lulav</italic> is that it&#x2019;s main stem besides the upper leaves should measure four <italic>tefachim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn744">3</xref></sup> In extreme circumstances, a length of 13&#x2153; <italic>egudlin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn744">3</xref></sup> is sufficient.</p>
<p>2) The <italic>hadas</italic> (myrtle twig) must have leaves growing in groups of three, that is, each set of leaf buds should produce three leaves on the same horizontal level, none should be higher or lower than the others. Also it is essential that the leaves cover the twig, that is, that the tip of each leaf should overlap the stem of the leaf above it. Among the <italic>hadassim</italic> that are imported from distant places you rarely find valid ones, and you must, therefore, examine them. A God-fearing person should do his best to buy <italic>hadassim</italic> that are fresh, green and have leaves &#x201C;in a threesome,&#x201D; and are beautiful. You must make sure that those grown locally have not been grafted, and have not been grown in a pot that has no hole [in the bottom]. Similarly, we must be concerned regarding the <italic>lulavim</italic> that grow in our region. If <italic>hadassim</italic> with &#x201C;threesome&#x201D; leaves are unavailable you may take those without &#x201C;threesome&#x201D; leaves, but you should not say the berachah.</p>
<p>3) The required length of a <italic>hadas</italic> is three <italic>tefachim</italic>. In extreme circumstances ten <italic>egudlin</italic> is sufficient. The entire <italic>hadas</italic>, from bottom to top, should have leaves growing in &#x201C;threesomes.&#x201D; In extreme circumstances, however, if at the bottom there are a few leaves not in &#x201C;threesomes,&#x201D; but on top the majority are &#x201C;threesomes,&#x201D; it is also valid. You should be careful that the leaves of the <italic>hadas</italic> should not fall off; for even if some of the leaves fall off, there are many differing <italic>Halachos</italic>, and you must consult an <italic>halachic</italic> authority.</p>
<p>4) You should make sure that the top [of the <italic>hadas</italic>] is not broken off, that is, the top of the wooden stem. If you have only <italic>hadassim</italic> with broken-off tops, you should consult an <italic>halachic</italic> authority. But the small side-branches that grow between the leaf-buds must be broken off so that they should not form a separation between the leaf-buds.</p>
<p>5) The <italic>aravah</italic> (willow) is well-known, it has lengthy leaves that have smooth edges, and it has a red stem. Even when the stem is still green, the <italic>aravah</italic> is valid, because if it stays on the tree it turns red. Most of this species grow near a brook, therefore, they are called <italic>arvei nachal</italic> [willows of the brook] (Leviticus 23:40). But even if they grow elsewhere they are valid, but if it is possible, you should try to get those that grow near a brook. The required size of the <italic>aravah</italic> is the same as that of the <italic>hadas</italic>.</p>
<p>6) An <italic>aravah</italic> that is dried up, or if most of its leaves have fallen off, or if its stem is broken off, is invalid. Some authorities say, that if the leaves are partially torn from the stem and are hanging limp it is also invalid. You should be extremely careful also with regard to the <italic>aravah</italic>, because sometimes when you insert it in its place among the <italic>lulav</italic> [and the <italic>hadas</italic>], or because of the waving, the leaves fall off and then it becomes invalid.</p>
<p>7) Care should be taken that a Jew should not personally cut off any of the four species from a tree for his own use, even if the owner of the land gives him permission;<sup><xref rid="fn745">4</xref></sup> but a non-Jew or another Jew should cut them off and then he should buy it from him.</p>
<p>8) You should take three <italic>hadas</italic> branches and two <italic>aravah</italic> branches, (no more than that), and bind them together with the <italic>lulav</italic>, so that they become one bundle. You should make sure that they are all [bound together] in the direction they grow, that is, with the cut edges downward. For, if only one branch is upside down, it is invalid, even ex post facto, [after it is already done]. You should bind the <italic>hadas</italic> on the right of the stem of the <italic>lulav</italic> and the <italic>aravah</italic> on its left side,<sup><xref rid="fn746">5</xref></sup> that is, when you take the <italic>lulav</italic>, with its stem facing you, the <italic>hadas</italic> should be opposite your right and the <italic>aravah</italic> opposite your left.<sup><xref rid="fn747">6</xref></sup> On the bottom they should all be even, so that when you take the <italic>lulav</italic> you should hold all the species [in your hand]. Nevertheless, you should see to it that the <italic>hadas</italic> should be slightly higher than the <italic>aravah</italic>. And you should make sure that the stem of the <italic>lulav</italic> protrudes at least a <italic>tefach</italic> above the <italic>hadas</italic>. You should tie all of them together with a complete knot, that is, two knots one on top of the other. Besides binding these [three] species together you should also fasten three more bands on the <italic>lulav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn748">7</xref></sup> However, at least only one <italic>tefach</italic> at the top of the <italic>lulav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn749">8</xref></sup> should remain without a band, in order to make a rustling sound when you shake it. If there is a string tied around the <italic>hadassim</italic>, you must remove it before binding it with the <italic>lulav</italic>, so that nothing intervenes between [the <italic>hadassim</italic> and the <italic>lulav</italic>]. If the <italic>lulav</italic>-bundle becomes undone on Yom Tov, it is forbidden to tie it on Yom Tov with a knot, but you may make a loop, or as the custom is, to wind the strip around the <italic>lulav</italic> and insert the end of the strip into the ring you made.</p>
<p>9) An <italic>aravah</italic> that was cut off the tree either on the first day of Yom Tov or on the second day is forbidden to be handled on that day, because it is absolutely <italic>muktzeh</italic>. If it was cut on the first day, it may be used on the second day. But if the first day occurs on Shabbos, and it was cut then, it is also forbidden on the second day. If an <italic>esrog</italic> was brought in, from outside the Shabbos boundary, or if any of the other species were brought in, you may handle them and fulfill the mitzvah with them. But if the city has no <italic>eiruv</italic>, you may not move them outside the house where they are found; and all must go to this house to fulfill the mitzvah with them.</p>
<p>10) Should you not have been able to obtain choice specimens of all four species, you should rather fulfill the mitzvah with a set belonging to a friend,<sup><xref rid="fn750">9</xref></sup> [who has obtained choice specimen,] (see following chapter, par. 8). Nevertheless, it is a mitzvah for you to obtain for yourself the best four species you can afford, in order to wave with them when you say <italic>Halleil</italic> and also for the <italic>Hakafos</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn742">1. See <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> [649:58] for definition of what constitutes &#x201C;extreme circumstances.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn743">2. Most authorities are of this opinion and therefore you must not be lenient in this matter. (See <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 645:25)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn744">3. See glossary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn745">4. This halachah is based on the concern that the non-Jew possessed the land illegally by stealing it from its Jewish owner. Therefore if you personally take these species from the land, you may be actually acquiring them illegally. It is best therefore that you acquire them from a non-Jew who took them from the land and possessed them, for once he becomes the owner, you may legally purchase them from him. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> questions if this ruling applies to our times. (See <italic>Biur Halachah</italic> 649:1 and <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 649:10)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn746">5. See <italic>Shaar Hatzion</italic> (651:11) who mentions that there are those who follow the custom of <italic>Ari Zal</italic> which is different than the custom stated here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn747">6. This ruling also applies to one who is left-handed. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 651:12)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn748">7. According to <italic>Taz</italic> the band that is tied around the species at the bottom of the <italic>lulav</italic> is counted as one of the three bands. <italic>Eliyohu Rabbah</italic> rules, however, that there must be three bands in addition to the one holding the species together. (See <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 651:14)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn749">8. This refers to the stem of the <italic>lulav</italic>. A <italic>tefach</italic> of the stem should remain without a band.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn750">9. According to <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic>, it is better to use your own even if they are not as beautiful as your friends. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 658:39)</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 137 Laws of Taking the Lulav and the Hakafos</title>
<p>1) You should take the <italic>lulav</italic>, together with the bundle, the stem [spine] of the <italic>lulav</italic> facing you&#x2014;in your right hand, and the <italic>esrog</italic> in your left hand.<sup><xref rid="fn751">1</xref></sup> As in all mitzvos, you must say the berachah on the <italic>lulav</italic> before performing the mitzvah. You must also hold the <italic>esrog</italic> in the manner it grows, that is, that the stem from where it was cut off the tree should point downward and the <italic>pitam</italic> [knob on top] upward. Therefore, when you pick up the <italic>esrog</italic> before saying the berachah, you should hold it upside down, with the stem facing upward and the <italic>pitam</italic> downward, in order not to fulfill the mitzvah<sup><xref rid="fn752">2</xref></sup> before saying the berachah. Then, while standing, you should say the berachah <italic>Al netilas lulav</italic> [Concerning the taking of the <italic>lulav</italic>]. (Because the <italic>lulav</italic> is taller than any of the other species, it is considered more important, and the entire bundle is called by that name.) On the first day of <italic>Sukkos</italic> you should also say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn753">3</xref></sup> If the first day of <italic>Sukkos</italic> occurs on Shabbos, when we do not take the <italic>lulav</italic>, then you say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> on the second day. After the berachah you turn the <italic>esrog</italic> around,<sup><xref rid="fn752">2</xref></sup> and holding it close to the <italic>lulav</italic>, so that there is no separation between them, you wave [the species]<sup><xref rid="fn754">4</xref></sup> towards the four points of the earth, in this sequence: East, South, West, North, up and down.<sup><xref rid="fn755">5</xref></sup> When waving during <italic>Halleil</italic> and during the <italic>Hoshanos</italic>, you should also be careful to hold the <italic>esrog</italic> close to the <italic>lulav</italic>, so that there is no separation between them. If you did it in the opposite manner, and took the <italic>esrog</italic> with the right hand and the <italic>lulav</italic> with the left hand you should take them again, without saying the berachah.</p>
<p>2) A left-handed person should take the <italic>lulav</italic> with <italic>his</italic> &#x201C;right&#x201D; hand, which is everyone else&#x2019;s left hand, and the <italic>esrog</italic> with his [so-called] &#x201C;left&#x201D; hand. If he did it in the opposite manner he should take them again without saying a berachah. A person who is ambidextrous is considered as any [right-handed] person.</p>
<p>3) It is proper to take off the <italic>tefillin</italic> before taking the <italic>lulav</italic> in hand, or at least remove the strap from your hand, so that nothing intervenes between [your hand and the <italic>esrog</italic>.] It is also proper to remove the rings from your fingers.</p>
<p>4) The order of the waving in <italic>Halleil</italic> is as follows: There are six words in <italic>Hodu</italic> [Give thanks] besides the Name <italic>Hashem</italic>; and at each word you should wave in a different direction; but when saying Hashem, you should not wave. At <italic>Hodu</italic> you wave towards the East (straight ahead), at <italic>ki</italic> towards the South (right), at <italic>tov</italic> towards the West (back), at <italic>ki</italic> towards the North (left), at <italic>le&#x2019;olam</italic>,&#x2014;upward; at <italic>chasdo</italic>, &#x2014;downward.<sup><xref rid="fn756">6</xref></sup> The <italic>Chazzan</italic> waves only at <italic>Hodu</italic> and at <italic>Yomar na Yisrael</italic>. The congregation waves each time they say <italic>Hodu</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn757">7</xref></sup> At <italic>Ana</italic>, both the <italic>Chazzan</italic> and the congregation wave only when saying <italic>Ana Hashem hoshiah na</italic>, [Please Hashem, save now&#x0021;] But since this verse has only three words besides <italic>Hashem</italic>, you should wave at each word in two directions. In the <italic>Hodu</italic> at the conclusion of <italic>Halleil</italic> both the <italic>Chazzan</italic> and the congregation wave again. When waving downward you should lower only your hands, while the <italic>lulav</italic> and the other species should remain [in an upright position] the same way they grow. People who have the custom to turn the <italic>lulav</italic> downwards should not change their custom. It is not necessary to turn your face in the direction in which you are waving; you should only point the top of the <italic>lulav</italic>, [in that direction]. You do not have to wave the <italic>lulav</italic> forcefully, just shaking it slightly to rustle the leaves is sufficient.</p>
<p>5) It is forbidden to eat before fulfilling the mitzvah of <italic>lulav</italic>. If you are traveling and anticipate to arrive at a place where there is an <italic>esrog</italic> and a <italic>lulav;</italic> or people who live in small villages, [and must wait until] an <italic>esrog</italic> and <italic>lulav</italic> is sent to them, must wait until midday, but no later, because it is forbidden to fast longer than that on Yom Tov and <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>. If you feel faint and cannot wait until noon, you may have something to eat before; but if you do not feel faint you should be stringent and abstain from tasting any food.</p>
<p>6) You are permitted to replace the <italic>lulav</italic> in water on Yom Tov, and add water to the vessel [in which it is placed], but you may not change the water. However, on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic> it is a mitzvah to change the water for the purpose of keeping the <italic>lulav</italic> fresh and beautiful. It is customary to buy fresh <italic>aravos</italic> on each day of <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>, for the <italic>lulav</italic>; for thereby you enhance the beauty of the mitzvah.</p>
<p>7) It is forbidden to inhale the fragrance of the <italic>hadassim</italic> during the seven days of <italic>Sukkos</italic>, even on Shabbos. But you may inhale the aroma of the <italic>esrog</italic> on Shabbos, and you should say the berachah <italic>Hanosein rei&#x2019;ach tov bapeiros</italic>, [Who places a good aroma into fruit]. But on the other days of <italic>Sukkos</italic>, you should not smell it, even when you are not taking it to fulfill the mitzvah, because it is <italic>halachically</italic> doubtful whether you should say a berachah on it. It is forbidden to handle the <italic>lulav</italic> on Shabbos, even if you need the <italic>lulav</italic> itself or the space it occupies, because it is <italic>muktzeh</italic>. However, since you are permitted to smell the <italic>esrog</italic>, it is not <italic>muktzeh</italic>, and you may handle it. And you are permitted to put it back in the cotton where it was kept before Yom Tov, because it already absorbed the fragrance. However you should not place it in new cotton or in a garment, because you are creating fragrance in the garment, [which is forbidden on Shabbos].</p>
<p>8) On the first day of <italic>Sukkos</italic>, you cannot fulfill the mitzvah with a <italic>lulav</italic> and other species that were borrowed, but they must actually belong to you, for it is written, &#x201C;And take for yourself on the first day.&#x201D; (Leviticus 23:40) And [our Rabbis] expound &#x201C;For yourself&#x201D; means &#x201C;from that which is yours,&#x201D; which excludes a borrowed [<italic>lulav</italic> or other species] Those living outside <italic>Eretz Yisrael</italic> who observe Yom Tov two days, because of a doubt [about the date], even on the second day should not say a berachah [over a borrowed <italic>lulav</italic>]. If someone gives you his <italic>lulav</italic> as a gift, on condition that you return it, it is considered [<italic>halachically</italic> as] a gift and you may fulfill the mitzvah with it. Even if he gives it to you unconditionally for the purpose of fulfilling the mitzvah, it is considered as if he had expressly stipulated<sup><xref rid="fn758">8</xref></sup> that he is giving it to you as a gift on condition that you return it. If the husband is not at home and the wife wants to give the <italic>lulav</italic> to someone to fulfill the mitzvah, the validity depends on the judgment of the husband&#x2019;s disposition, whether or not he would mind.</p>
<p>9) If people joined to buy an <italic>esrog</italic> and the other species [in partnership], we presume that they bought it with the understanding, that when it is time to perform the mitzvah, each partner would transfer his share to the other.<sup><xref rid="fn759">9</xref></sup> Therefore, it is customary for the congregation to buy an <italic>esrog</italic>, and the entire congregation fulfills the mitzvah with it,<sup><xref rid="fn760">10</xref></sup> and whoever can afford it must contribute to the &#x201C;<italic>esrog</italic> fund.&#x201D; Still, it is better to fulfill the mitzvah with an <italic>esrog</italic> belonging to an individual, if all his species are superbly beautiful, because an individual&#x2019;s transfer of ownership is more effective.</p>
<p>10) On the first day of <italic>Sukkos</italic><sup><xref rid="fn761">11</xref></sup> minor children should not be permitted to take the <italic>lulav</italic> and <italic>esrog</italic> before the adults have fulfilled the mitzvah, for a minor can acquire an object but cannot transfer ownership, according to Torah law.</p>
<p>11) On all the days of <italic>Sukkos</italic>, after the <italic>Musaf</italic> service,<sup><xref rid="fn762">12</xref></sup> it is customary to carry a <italic>Seifer Torah</italic> to the <italic>bimah</italic>. The Ark remains open until the conclusion of the <italic>Hoshana</italic> service, when the <italic>Seifer Torah</italic> is returned to the Ark. All men who possess an <italic>esrog</italic> and <italic>lulav</italic> circle the <italic>bimah</italic>, where the <italic>Seifer Torah</italic> is held, while the <italic>Hoshanos</italic> are recited. Each day they circle the <italic>bimah</italic> once. But on the seventh day [of <italic>Sukkos</italic>] which is <italic>Hoshana Rabbah</italic>, all the <italic>Sifrei Torah</italic> are removed from the Ark and brought to the <italic>bimah</italic>. The <italic>bimah</italic> is circled seven times, in remembrance of the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, where each day [of <italic>Sukkos</italic>] they would circle the altar once and on the seventh day, seven times. The <italic>hakafos</italic> (circuits) should be made, [starting] to the right. Since the <italic>Seifer Torah</italic> is on the <italic>bimah</italic>, and the entire congregation must turn towards the <italic>Seifer Torah</italic> on the <italic>bimah</italic> before beginning the <italic>hakafah</italic>, their right side thus faces North; therefore, the circle moves in a northerly direction. A person who owns an <italic>esrog</italic> and <italic>lulav</italic> and does not encircle the <italic>bimah</italic> manifests poor conduct. In some communities it is customary on <italic>Hoshana Rabbah</italic> and <italic>Simchas Torah</italic>, after they remove all the <italic>Sifrei Torah</italic> from the Ark, to place a burning candle in it (to indicate that Torah is light, and when the Torah is not there, another light is needed). This is not a proper custom and should be abolished, for it is forbidden to use the Holy Ark for secular purposes, even temporarily.</p>
<p>12) On Shabbos no circuits are made because even in the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> they did not circle the altar [on Shabbos]. Therefore, a <italic>Seifer Torah</italic> is not brought to the <italic>bimah</italic>, but the Holy Ark is left open until after the <italic>Hoshanos</italic> are said.</p>
<p>13) A person who becomes a mourner on <italic>Sukkos</italic>, or a mourner during the twelve months after the death of his father or mother, according to custom, should not encircle the <italic>bimah</italic>, but he should give his <italic>esrog</italic> and <italic>lulav</italic> to someone who does not own a <italic>lulav</italic>, to circle the <italic>bimah</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn751">1. If you take both of them in one hand, according to some <italic>poskim</italic> you have not fulfilled your obligation and you must take them again with two hands as prescribed. According to <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> we should be stringent and follow this ruling but another berachah should not be said. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 651:15)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn752">2. According to <italic>Beis Yosef</italic> there is another option&#x2014;to have in mind that you are not fulfilling the mitzvah until you have them all in your hand. <italic>Vilna Gaon</italic> writes that this is the best way. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 651:25)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn753">3. If you did not say the berachah <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> on the first day, you may say it on any of the other days. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 651:29)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn754">4. In addition to holding the <italic>Four Species</italic> together&#x2014;which is sufficient for the fulfillment of the mitzvah&#x2014;you should also perform the waving (or shaking) of the Species in the same manner. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 651:49)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn755">5. It is preferable to face east while waving the Species. The sequence followed in most <italic>Ashkenaz</italic> congregations is: straight ahead (i.e., east), right (south), back (west), left (north), up and down. The generally followed manner of waving is to stretch out the arms and shake the bundle enough to rustle the leaves of the <italic>lulav</italic>, and then draw the bundle close to the chest and shake again. This procedure is repeated three times in each direction. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 651:47)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn756">6. Many congregations have adopted the custom of the <italic>Ari Zal</italic> which is South (right), North (left), East (straight ahead), upward, downward, West (back). There are also different customs regarding the verses at which the congregation waves the <italic>lulav</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn757">7. If you are praying individually (not with a congregation) you wave only at the first and last <italic>Hodu</italic> of the <italic>Halleil</italic> and also at <italic>Ana Hashem Hoshiah na</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 651:41)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn758">8. In a case where the donor does not know that you cannot fulfill the mitzvah unless it is considered completely yours, you cannot fulfill the mitzvah unless he expressly gives it to you as a returnable gift. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 649:15)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 138 Laws of Hoshana Rabbah, Shemini Atzeres and Simchas Torah</title>
<p>1) The fifth (in Eretz Yisrael, the sixth) day of <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic> is <italic>Hoshana Rabbah</italic>. It is customary to stay awake the preceding night and to study Torah, according to the order printed [in the <italic>Tikkun</italic>], because on <italic>Sukkos</italic> we are judged with regard to water, upon which human life depends, and this day is the last day of <italic>Sukkos</italic>, and all depends upon the conclusion [of judgment.] At <italic>Shacharis</italic> additional candles are lit in the synagogue, as on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, and the <italic>Chazzan</italic> wears a <italic>kittel</italic>. <italic>Lamenatzei&#x2019;ach</italic> [for the choirmaster] is said as on Yom Tov, and <italic>Mizmor lesodah</italic> [a psalm of thanksgiving] is also said, but <italic>Nishmas</italic> [the soul] is not said. We say <italic>Ein kamocha</italic> [There is none like you], and <italic>Shema Yisrael</italic>, as on Yom Tov. In the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of <italic>Musaf</italic> we say <italic>Na&#x2019;aritzecha</italic> [We will revere].</p>
<p>2) The prophets instituted the custom, that each person should take a special <italic>aravah</italic>, on that day besides the <italic>aravah</italic> in the <italic>lulav</italic> bundle. Whatever disqualifies the <italic>aravah</italic> of the <italic>lulav</italic> [bundle] also disqualifies this <italic>aravah</italic>. Therefore, a Jew should not cut it himself for his own use. (as I have written in ch. 136:7 above); the only difference [of the special <italic>aravah</italic>] is that even if most of the leaves fell off, it is valid. Even if there is only one leaf left on one branch, it is valid. However, the beauty of the mitzvah is enhanced when the <italic>aravah</italic> has many leaves and a long branch. It is a beautiful custom to take five branches [for the special <italic>aravah</italic>] and tie them together with a leaf of a <italic>lulav</italic>.</p>
<p>3) You should not take this <italic>aravah</italic> together with the <italic>lulav</italic>, but when you begin to say <italic>Ta&#x2019;aneh emunim</italic> [Answer the faithful]<sup><xref rid="fn763">1</xref></sup> you put down the <italic>lulav</italic> and the <italic>esrog</italic> and take the <italic>aravah</italic>, for then we pray for water. At the conclusion of the <italic>Hoshanos</italic>, you wave the <italic>aravah</italic> and beat it on the ground five times, and it is sufficient, even if no leaves fall off in the process. After beating the <italic>aravah</italic>, you should not throw it on the floor, because it shows contempt of the mitzvah. It is best to put save it and cast it into the fire of [the oven] when you bake matzos (for Pesach), since it was used for one mitzvah it should be used for another mitzvah.</p>
<p>4) On the night of <italic>Shemini Atzeres</italic> you should wait [and be sure] not to say the <italic>Kiddush</italic> before nightfall. In the <italic>Kiddush</italic> you should say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic>, because it is a Yom Tov in itself. You should not say <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>, because in the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic> and in the <italic>Kiddush</italic>, we say <italic>Yom hashemini chag ha&#x2019;atzeres hazeh</italic> [the Eighth Day, this Festival of Assembly], and if you said <italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>, you would be contradicting yourself.</p>
<p>5) The night of <italic>Shemini Atzeres</italic> and the whole day, you should eat in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, but you should not say the berachah [<italic>Leisheiv basukkah</italic>], as we have mentioned. When you take final leave of the <italic>sukkah</italic> you should say <italic>Yehi ratzon</italic>, [May it be favorable] etc. Regarding sleeping in the <italic>sukkah</italic>, some authorities take a lenient view, and this is the accepted custom; but it is proper to follow the stricter view.</p>
<p>6) On the eighth day near dark, you may remove the vessels from the <italic>sukkah</italic> into the house; but you should not arrange them in proper order while it is still day,<sup><xref rid="fn764">2</xref></sup> for that is considered preparing on one Yom Tov for another.</p>
<p>7) The last day of Yom Tov, which is also <italic>Shemini Atzeres</italic>, is called <italic>Simchas Torah</italic>, because on this day we conclude [the reading of] the Torah, and we rejoice with it. In the evening, after <italic>Maariv</italic>, we make [seven] <italic>Hakafos</italic> [circuits] carrying the <italic>Sifrei Torah</italic> around the <italic>bimah</italic>, after which the <italic>Sifrei Torah</italic> are replaced in the Ark. We leave one <italic>Seifer Torah</italic> from which we read for three people<sup><xref rid="fn765">3</xref></sup> from the portion <italic>Vezos haberachah</italic> [This is the blessing], (Deuteronomy 33). In some communities it is customary to read the portions dealing with vows. After the reading of the Torah, the <italic>half-kaddish</italic> is said, the <italic>Seifer Torah</italic> is replaced in the Ark, and <italic>Aleinu</italic> is said.</p>
<p>8) On the day of <italic>Simchas Torah</italic> it is the custom in many communities that the <italic>Kohanim</italic> bless the people in the <italic>Shacharis</italic> service and not in <italic>Musaf</italic>, since during <italic>Musaf</italic> the <italic>Kohanim</italic> may be intoxicated. We do not say <italic>Vesei&#x2019;areiv</italic> [May our entreaties be pleasing] when the <italic>Kohanim</italic> bless the people at <italic>Shacharis</italic> prayers.</p>
<p>9) In the daytime, after the <italic>Hakafos</italic>, three <italic>Sifrei Torah</italic> are left out, and many people are called up to one <italic>Seifer Torah</italic>, to read the portion <italic>Vezos haberachah</italic> up to <italic>Me&#x2019;onah</italic> (Deut. 33:27) repeating it many times. At the end, all the young boys are called up. It is proper that a boy who is <italic>bar mitzvah</italic> should say the berachah and that the others should listen.<sup><xref rid="fn766">4</xref></sup> The verse <italic>Hamalach hagoel</italic> is read for them<sup><xref rid="fn767">5</xref></sup> [The angel who delivered me] etc. (Genesis 48:16). After that, the <italic>Chasan Torah</italic> is called up and he reads from <italic>Me&#x2019;onah</italic> to the end [of the Torah]. In the second <italic>Seifer Torah</italic>, the <italic>Chasan Bereishis</italic> reads. Then <italic>half-kaddish</italic> is said. In the third <italic>Seifer Torah, Maftir</italic> is read. (see chapter 79:1 above) It is the custom in many communities to be mindful to call up an eminent person for <italic>Chasan Torah</italic>. Even a person who was called up already for the reading of <italic>Vezos haberachah</italic>, may still be called up as <italic>Chasan Torah</italic> or as <italic>Chasan Bereishis</italic>. Where there are only two <italic>Sifrei Torah, Vezos haberachah</italic> should be read in one, and <italic>Bereishis</italic> in the other one, and the first <italic>seifer</italic> is taken again for <italic>Maftir</italic>.</p>
<p>10) It is customary for the <italic>Chasan Torah</italic> and the <italic>Chasan Bereishis</italic> to make donations to charity,<sup><xref rid="fn768">6</xref></sup> and to invite all their friends to a joyous meal in honor of the completion of the Torah and its beginning. As it is written in the <italic>Midrash</italic>, (At the beginning of <italic>Koheles</italic> [Ecclesiastes], &#x201C;He came to Jerusalem and he stood in front of the Ark of the Covenant of Hashem&#x201D; etc. &#x201C;&#x2026; and he made a banquet for all his servants.&#x201D; Rabbi Yitzchak said, &#x201C;From this we can infer, that you should make a festive meal upon the completion of the Torah.&#x201D;</p>
<ftnote id="fn763">1. This is according to <italic>Sheloh</italic>, but according to <italic>Ari Zal</italic>, this is done after the final, whole <italic>Kaddish</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn764">2. However, if they will cause the house to look unkempt, it is permitted to put them away neatly. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 667:6)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn765">3. In some communities five people are called to read from the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn766">4. They will be exempt with his berachah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn767">5. According to <italic>Levush</italic> this verse is recited over them as an oral blessing, but it is not read. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 669:14)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn768">6. It is a proper custom for all who are called to the Torah, to contribute for the support of the <italic>Beis Hamedrash</italic> and for the support of those who study the Torah. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 669:7)</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 139 Laws of Chanukah</title>
<p>1) During the era of the Second <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> when the Greek kingdom was in power, they imposed evil decrees against the Jewish people, designed to put an end to their religion. They did not permit them to study the Torah or to perform the mitzvos; they plundered their property, [abducted] their daughters, entered the Temple, violating its sanctity and defiling its purity. Yisrael was in great distress because of them, for they oppressed them bitterly, until the God of our fathers took pity on them and delivered them from their dominion, and rescued them. The Hasmoneans, the sons of the <italic>Kohein Gadol</italic> defeated and killed them, and delivered Yisrael from their dominion. They appointed as king one of the <italic>Kohanim</italic>, and the Kingdom of Yisrael returned to power and [endured] for more than two hundred years, until the destruction of the Second <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>. When Yisrael triumphed over their enemies and destroyed them, &#x2014;this happened on the twenty-fifth of Kislev&#x2014;, they entered the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, and found of the pure oil in the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> only one jar, that was stamped with the seal of the <italic>Kohein Gadol</italic>. This oil was sufficient to burn for only one day, but they lit the lights of the <italic>Menorah</italic> with it [and it lasted] for eight days, until they crushed olives and extracted pure oil. For this reason the Sages of that generation ordained that these eight days, beginning on the twenty-fifth of <italic>Kislev</italic>, should be days of rejoicing and praise. We kindle lights in the evening near the entrance to the house every night, during these eight nights, in order to display and reveal the miracle. These days are called <italic>Chanukah</italic>, which means [it is a contraction of] <italic>chanu chaf-hei</italic> [they rested on the twenty-fifth]. For on the twenty-fifth of <italic>Kislev</italic> they rested from their enemies [onslaughts]. Another reason [for the name <italic>Chanukah</italic>] is that during these days they dedicated the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic> [<italic>Chanukas habayis</italic>], that had been defiled by the oppressors. Some authorities say, therefore, that it is a mitzvah to somewhat embellish the meals on <italic>Chanukah</italic>. Another reason for celebrating <italic>Chanukah</italic> is that the construction of the <italic>Mishkan</italic> was completed during these days. You should tell your family the story of the miracles that were performed for our forefathers, during these days (see Flavius Josephus). Nevertheless, a <italic>Chanukah</italic> feast is not considered a mitzvah, unless you sing hymns and praises to Hashem during the meal.<sup><xref rid="fn769">1</xref></sup> On <italic>Chanukah</italic> you should give charity generously, for the days of <italic>Chanukah</italic> are auspicious to correct flaws of the soul through the giving of charity,<sup><xref rid="fn770">2</xref></sup> especially when it is given to support poor, Torah scholars.</p>
<p>2) Fasting is not permitted on <italic>Chanukah</italic>. However, on the day before <italic>Chanukah</italic> and on the day after <italic>Chanukah</italic>, it is permitted to deliver a eulogy<sup><xref rid="fn771">3</xref></sup> and to fast.</p>
<p>3) You are permitted to work on <italic>Chanukah</italic>. But women follow the custom, not to do any work during the time the <italic>Chanukah</italic> lights are burning, and you should not [cause them] to treat this matter lightly. The reason that women are more stringent about this [than men], is that the cruelty of the evil decree was directed mainly at Jewish women. For [the Greeks] decreed that a virgin girl before her wedding must first cohabit with the general. Another reason for this is that the miracle came about through a woman. The daughter of Yochanan the <italic>Kohein Gadol</italic> was a very beautiful girl, and the ruthless king wanted her to lie with him. She told him that she would fulfill his request; and she served him cheese dishes, so that he would be thirsty, and drink wine; then become intoxicated, and fall asleep. That is precisely what happened. Then she cut off his head and brought it to Jerusalem. When the general saw that the king was dead, he [and his army] fled. Therefore, some people have the custom to eat dairy dishes on <italic>Chanukah</italic>, to commemorate the miracle achieved by means of a dairy product.</p>
<p>4) All kinds of oil are valid for the <italic>Chanukah</italic> lights. Nevertheless, the mitzvah done to perfection is to use olive oil, similar to the miracle in the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, which was achieved with olive oil. If this cannot be obtained you should select another kind of oil that gives a clear, bright flame, or wax candles, for they also produce clear light. You should not use two candles braided together, for that would be like a torch; but each candle should [burn] by itself. You should not make the candles from wax that comes from houses of idol worship, for that is repulsive. All wicks are valid for <italic>Chanukah</italic> lights. The mitzvah done to perfection is to use cotton. It is not necessary to take new wicks every night, but you may light the old wicks until they are used up.</p>
<p>5) If you light a <italic>menorah</italic> made of earthenware, after you light it one night it deteriorates and you should not light it again the following night, because it is repulsive. Therefore, you should possess a beautiful <italic>menorah</italic> made of metal. If you can afford it, you should buy a silver <italic>menorah</italic>, in order to adorn the mitzvah.</p>
<p>6) It is the widespread custom in our regions [to follow the practice] of the most scrupulously observant, whereby each member of the family kindles one light on the first night, two lights on the second, and keeps adding until on the eighth night, he kindles eight lights. You should be careful that each person places his <italic>menorah</italic> in a separate place, so that one can easily tell how many lights are lit [that night]. The <italic>menorah</italic> should not be lit in a place where candles are lit all year, in order to make it manifestly clear that these are <italic>Chanukah</italic> lights.</p>
<p>7) It is a mitzvah to light the <italic>menorah</italic> in the doorway that opens to the street, [public domain], in order to publicize the miracle; and it was done in this manner in the days of the Mishnah and the Talmud. Now, since we live among non-Jews, we light the <italic>menorah</italic> in the house, and if you have a window facing the street, you should light it there; if not, you should light it near the door. It is a mitzvah to place the <italic>menorah</italic> within a <italic>tefach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn772">4</xref></sup> of the left side of the door so that the <italic>mezuzah</italic> will be on the right<sup><xref rid="fn773">5</xref></sup> and the <italic>Chanukah</italic> lights on the left, and in so doing you find yourself surrounded by mitzvos. It is preferable to place the <italic>menorah</italic> within the open space of the door.</p>
<p>8) The mitzvah requires that [the <italic>menorah</italic>] be placed higher than three <italic>tefachim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn772">4</xref></sup> above the floor and lower than ten <italic>tefachim</italic>. But if you placed it higher than ten <italic>tefachim</italic> you have fulfilled your obligation. However, if you placed it higher than twenty <italic>amos</italic><sup><xref rid="fn772">4</xref></sup> you have not fulfilled your obligation, because when it is placed higher than twenty <italic>amos</italic> it is out of the range of vision. If you live on an upper floor you may place [the <italic>menorah</italic>] in the window, even though it is higher than ten <italic>tefachim</italic> from the ground. But if the window is higher than twenty <italic>amos</italic> from the ground of the public domain, where it is out of visual range of the people walking in the street, then it is preferable to place the lights near the door.</p>
<p>9) The lights should be placed in an even row; one should not be higher than the other. Space should be left between the lights,<sup><xref rid="fn774">6</xref></sup> so that the flames will not merge and look like a torch. Wax candles should be separated,<sup><xref rid="fn774">6</xref></sup> so they will not become heated from each other and cause the wax to melt, and become spoiled. If you fill a dish with oil and put wicks around it, and you place a [perforated] cover on it, each wick counts as a separate light.<sup><xref rid="fn775">7</xref></sup> If you did not place such a cover on it, it does not even count as one light, because it resembles a torch. A lamp that has two or more branches should not be kindled by two persons, even on the first night, because there is no way to tell how many candles were lit [for that night].<sup><xref rid="fn776">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>10) The time to light [the <italic>menorah</italic>] is immediately after the stars appear,<sup><xref rid="fn777">9</xref></sup> and you should not delay it. It is forbidden to do anything before lighting the <italic>menorah</italic>, even to study Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn778">10</xref></sup> Except, if you have not prayed <italic>Maariv</italic>, you should first pray and then light the <italic>menorah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn779">11</xref></sup> Before lighting the <italic>menorah</italic>, you should gather the entire family, in order to proclaim the event publicly. You should pour in enough oil to burn at least half an hour.<sup><xref rid="fn780">12</xref></sup> If, inadvertently, you did not light them immediately, you may light them and say the <italic>berachos</italic>, as long as the members of your family are still awake.<sup><xref rid="fn781">13</xref></sup> However, after the family is asleep it is no longer considered a public event, and you should light them without saying the <italic>berachos</italic>. If you will not have time to light the <italic>menorah</italic> at night, you may do it before that time and light the <italic>menorah</italic> from <italic>pelag haMinchah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn782">14</xref></sup>, which is one and one-fourth hour before the stars come out, (these are &#x201C;time-variable&#x201D; hours, measured according to the length of daylight, see chapter 69:2 above. And in the season of <italic>Chanukah</italic>, when the days are short, the day is only ten hours long (measured by the clock), then <italic>pelag haMinchah</italic>, is one hour and two and one-half minutes before the stars appear). [You may kindle the <italic>menorah</italic> then] provided you pour in enough oil to burn until one-half hour after the stars become visible. If the lights do not burn that long you have not fulfilled the mitzvah.<sup><xref rid="fn783">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>11) According to our custom, the order of lighting the <italic>menorah</italic> is as follows: On the first night you kindle the light facing your right hand, on the second night you add one light to the left [of the previous night&#x2019;s light]; similarly, on each subsequent night you add one light to the left. The light that is added is always kindled first, and you continue lighting towards the right.</p>
<p>12) On the first night, you recite three <italic>berachos</italic> before lighting the <italic>menorah: Lehadlik</italic> [To kindle the <italic>Chanukah</italic> light], <italic>She&#x2019;asa nisim</italic> [Who has performed miracles], and <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic>. On the other nights you do not say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn784">16</xref></sup> After you say the <italic>berachos</italic> you kindle one light, and while kindling the others, you says, <italic>Haneiros halalu</italic> [These lights] etc. A convert to Judaism should say, &#x201C;Who has performed miracles for Yisrael,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn785">17</xref></sup> but if he said <italic>&#x201C;la&#x2019;avoseinu,&#x201D;</italic> [for our forefathers], he has fulfilled his obligation. An <italic>onein</italic> [a mourner before the burial], [should not light the <italic>menorah</italic>], but he should let someone else light the <italic>menorah</italic>, and say the <italic>berachos</italic>, and [the <italic>onein</italic>] should respond <italic>Amein</italic>. But if there is no one else, then he should light the <italic>menorah</italic> himself but without saying the <italic>berachos</italic>.</p>
<p>13) It is a <italic>halachic</italic> rule that the act of lighting the <italic>menorah</italic> creates the mitzvah, which means, that the kindling is the essence of the mitzvah, and when you light the <italic>menorah</italic> the lights must be in their proper place and must have the proper amount [of oil]. Accordingly if you lit them when they were lower than three <italic>tefachim</italic> [off the ground] or higher than twenty <italic>amos</italic>, and after they were already burning you placed them in their proper place, they are not valid.<sup><xref rid="fn786">18</xref></sup> Similarly, if, when you lit them, they did not have the required amount of oil, and afterwards you added [oil], it is of no avail.<sup><xref rid="fn787">19</xref></sup> Similarly if you set the <italic>menorah</italic> in a place where the wind is blowing and the lights are bound to be extinguished, you have not fulfilled the mitzvah, and you must light them again, but you should not say a berachah. But if you put them in the proper place and they were extinguished by accident, you have fulfilled the mitzvah. Nevertheless, it is customary to kindle them again. It is the custom to be strict and not rekindle an extinguished light with another <italic>Chanukah</italic> light, but you should light it with the <italic>shamash</italic> or with some other candle.</p>
<p>14) During the time [they are burning] in fulfillment of the mitzvah, that is, one-half hour,<sup><xref rid="fn788">20</xref></sup> it is forbidden to have any benefit from their light. It is the custom therefore, to place the <italic>shamash</italic> near them so that if you use the light, [for any personal purpose] you will be using the light of the <italic>shamash</italic>. You must place [the <italic>shamash</italic>] a little higher than the other lights, so that it is recognized that it is not one of the required number of lights.</p>
<p>15) The <italic>menorah</italic> is lit in the synagogue in order to herald the miracle publicly and the <italic>berachos</italic> are said over them. The <italic>menorah</italic> is placed near the southern wall, and it is kindled between <italic>Minchah</italic> and <italic>Maariv</italic>. But you cannot fulfill your obligation with the lighting of the <italic>menorah</italic> in the synagogue.<sup><xref rid="fn789">21</xref></sup> You must light them yourself at home. A mourner<sup><xref rid="fn790">22</xref></sup> should not light the <italic>menorah</italic> in the synagogue on the first night, because he has to say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic>, and a mourner should not say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> publicly; but he may say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> in his house.</p>
<p>16) Women are obligated to kindle the <italic>Chanukah</italic> lights, because they were involved in the miracle of <italic>Chanukah</italic>, (see paragraph 3 above). A woman may light the <italic>menorah</italic> on behalf of her entire family. A child who has reached the age to be trained [for mitzvos] must also light the <italic>menorah</italic>. If a blind person can become someone&#x2019;s partner by contributing towards buying the <italic>Chanukah</italic> lights, fulfilling his obligation through his partner&#x2019;s lighting that would be best. If he has a wife, she should light the <italic>menorah</italic> for him; but if he has no wife and lives by himself, so that he cannot become anyone&#x2019;s partner, he should light it with someone&#x2019;s assistance.<sup><xref rid="fn791">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>17) On <italic>erev Shabbos</italic> you should first kindle the <italic>Chanukah</italic> lights, then the Shabbos candles<sup><xref rid="fn792">24</xref></sup> but it should be after <italic>pelag haMinchah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn793">25</xref></sup> Before lighting them you should pray <italic>Minchah</italic>. You must put in enough oil to keep them burning until one-half hour after the stars come out, otherwise the <italic>berachos</italic> you say over them are in vain. If you light the <italic>menorah</italic> near the door, you must be careful<sup><xref rid="fn794">26</xref></sup> to place something between it and the door, so that the wind will not blow it out when the door is opened and closed.</p>
<p>18) On Shabbos night you should recite <italic>Havdalah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn795">27</xref></sup> and then kindle the <italic>Chanukah</italic> lights. In the synagogue the lights are kindled before <italic>Veyiten lecha</italic> is said.</p>
<p>19) If you are away from home,&#x2014;out of town; if you know that your wife<sup><xref rid="fn796">28</xref></sup> lights the <italic>menorah</italic> at home, you should light it wherever you are without saying the <italic>berachos</italic>. If possible, it is best to hear the <italic>berachos</italic> from someone who is lighting the <italic>menorah</italic> there, and have in mind to fulfill your obligation with his <italic>berachos</italic>, respond Amein, and after that, kindle the <italic>menorah</italic>, without saying the <italic>berachos</italic>. But if your wife does not light the <italic>menorah</italic> at home; similarly, yeshivah students boarding with a family must light the <italic>menorah</italic> and say the <italic>berachos</italic> or else, they should become partners<sup><xref rid="fn797">29</xref></sup> with the head of the household by giving him several coins, and thus they will also own a share of the oil and the wick. The head of the household should add a bit more oil than is required for the partner [or partners]. They should, however, make an effort to light their own <italic>menorah</italic>. If you are in town but in someone else&#x2019;s house, when it is time to light the <italic>menorah</italic> you must return home and light it.</p>
<p>20) The oil that is left in the <italic>menorah</italic> after <italic>Chanukah</italic>, as well as the wicks, should be burnt in a bonfire, because they were set aside for a mitzvah. It is forbidden to derive any benefit from them, unless you had made a provision beforehand that you do not set aside what will be left [after <italic>Chanukah</italic>].</p>
<p>21) During the eight days of <italic>Chanukah</italic> we say in the <italic>Shemoneh Esreih Al hanisim</italic> [For the miracles]. If you forgot to say it, and become aware of it before you said the Name of God in the berachah <italic>Hatov shimecha</italic> [&#x201C;The Beneficent is Your Name,&#x201D; etc.], you should turn back and start <italic>Al hanisim</italic>. But if you became aware of it after you pronounced the Name of God, you should conclude the berachah and not turn back [to <italic>Al hanisim</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn798">30</xref></sup> (Concerning <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> see Chapter 44:16 above.)</p>
<p>22) During the eight days of <italic>Chanukah</italic> we recite the complete <italic>Halleil</italic>, and we do not say <italic>Tachanun</italic>, nor <italic>Keil erech apayim</italic>, nor <italic>Lamenatzei&#x2019;ach</italic> nor <italic>Tzidkasecha tzedek</italic>. (For the <italic>halachah</italic> concerning the saying of <italic>Halleil</italic> in a mourner&#x2019;s house, see Chapter 207:6 below).</p>
<p>23) Each day [of <italic>Chanukah</italic>] we call up three men [for the reading of the Torah] from the chapter &#x201C;The Offerings of the Princes&#x201D; in the weekly portion of <italic>Naso</italic>. On the first day we begin to read for the <italic>kohein</italic>, from <italic>Vayehi beyom kalos Moshe</italic>, [On the day that Moses completed] (Numbers 7:1) until <italic>Lachanukas hamizbei&#x2019;ach</italic>, [For the dedication of the altar]; for the Levi, <italic>Vayehi hamakriv bayom harishon</italic>, [The one to bring his offering on the first day] etc. until <italic>melei&#x2019;ah ketores</italic> [Filled with incense]. For the <italic>Yisrael, Par echad</italic>, [One young bull] etc., until <italic>Ben Aminadav</italic>. On the second day for the <italic>kohein</italic> and the <italic>Levi</italic>, we read, <italic>Bayom hasheini</italic> [On the second day] etc., and for the <italic>Yisrael, Bayom hashelishi</italic>, [On the third day] etc. Similarly, on each subsequent day for the <italic>kohein</italic> and the <italic>Levi</italic> we read of the current day&#x2019;s offering, and for the <italic>Yisrael</italic>, the offering of the next day. On the eighth day, for the <italic>kohein</italic> and the <italic>Levi</italic>, we read, <italic>Bayom hashemini</italic> [On the eighth day] etc., and for the <italic>Yisrael</italic> we begin with <italic>Bayom hatesh&#x2019;i</italic>, [On the ninth day], completing the entire parashah, and we continue in <italic>parashas Beha&#x2019;alosecha</italic>, until <italic>kein asa es hamenorah</italic>, [So did he make the <italic>menorah</italic>] (Numbers 8:4).</p>
<p>24) On <italic>Shabbos Chanukah</italic>, two <italic>sifrei Torah</italic> are taken out of the Ark. In the first one we read the weekly portion;<sup><xref rid="fn799">31</xref></sup> and in the other we read the <italic>Maftir</italic> the &#x201C;day&#x201D; that corresponds to the current day of <italic>Chanukah</italic>. We read the <italic>Haftarah, Roni vesimchi</italic> [Sing and rejoice] (Zechariah 2:14). If another Shabbos occurs on <italic>Chanukah</italic>, we read for <italic>Maftir</italic> [on the second <italic>Shabbos Chanukah</italic>] from <italic>Melachim I</italic> (First Kings) 7:40 where the <italic>menorohs</italic> of Solomon [are mentioned]. If <italic>Rosh Chodesh Teiveis</italic> occurs on a weekday, two <italic>sifrei Torah</italic> are taken out of the Ark. In the first one we read the portion of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> for three men; we then read for the fourth person in the other <italic>seifer Torah</italic> the reading of the current day of <italic>Chanukah</italic>, because <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> is more frequent [than <italic>Chanukah</italic>], and it is an <italic>halachic</italic> rule, when a regular practice [conflicts with] an occasional practice the regular practice takes precedence. Therefore, the the <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> reading takes precedence. If, by mistake, the portion of <italic>Chanukah</italic> is read first; and even if the reading has not yet begun, but the one called up had already said the berachah,<sup><xref rid="fn800">32</xref></sup> there is no need to interrupt, and the reading should be concluded. After that, they should read for the other <italic>aliyos</italic> the portion of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>. If they read the portion of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> in the first [<italic>seifer Torah</italic>], as indeed they should, but by mistake, they called up the fourth person also to the portion of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>, even if they became aware of it immediately after he said the [concluding] berachah, then, if only one <italic>seifer Torah</italic> was taken out, no further reading is required. But if two <italic>sifrei Torah</italic> were taken out, and there is reason to fear that the [unused] <italic>seifer Torah</italic> will be slighted, because people will wrongly conclude that it is defective, a fifth person must be called for whom the portion of <italic>Chanukah</italic> is read. After this fifth <italic>aliyah</italic>, the <italic>half-kaddish</italic> is recited.</p>
<p>25) If <italic>Rosh Chodesh Teiveis</italic> occurs on Shabbos, three <italic>sifrei Torah</italic> are taken out. In the first one, six men are called up for the reading of the <italic>parashah</italic> of the week. To the second <italic>seifer Torah</italic>, a seventh person is called for the reading of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>, beginning from <italic>Uveyom haShabbos</italic> [And on the Sabbath day] (see Chapter 78:1 and Chapter 79:1 above). Then [half-kaddish] is said. In the third <italic>seifer Torah, Maftir</italic> is read, from the <italic>nasi</italic> of the current <italic>Chanukah</italic> day. For the <italic>Haftarah</italic> we read <italic>Roni vesimchi</italic>. Although the more frequent takes precedence, this rule applies only to Torah reading, where both [<italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> and <italic>Chanukah</italic>] are read, but in the case of the <italic>Haftarah</italic> where only one is read, we put aside <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> and read the <italic>Haftarah</italic> of <italic>Chanukah</italic>, to publicize the miracle.</p>
<p>26) The fifteenth day of <italic>Shevat</italic> is &#x201C;<italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> for Trees.&#x201D; We do not say <italic>Tachanun</italic> on that day, and it is the custom to eat many different kinds of tree-grown fruit.</p>
<ftnote id="fn769">1. In his responsa, <italic>Maharshal</italic> writes that it is fitting and proper that this festivity be combined and saturated with the spirit and joy of Torah. <italic>Biur Halachah</italic> writes: &#x201C;Adding to our grave sins, there are those who have substituted card playing and other secular frivolities instead of hymns and praises [at their so called <italic>Chanukah</italic> parties].&#x201D; (<italic>Biur Halachah</italic> 670:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn770">2. It has always been a custom for the poor to ask for charity during the days of <italic>Chanukah</italic>. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 670:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn771">3. Eulogies are forbidden on the days of <italic>Chanukah</italic> itself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn772">4. See glossary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn773">5. If for whatever reason there is no <italic>mezuzah</italic>, the <italic>Chanukah menorah</italic> should be placed on the right side of the door. (<italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 671:7)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn774">6. The space should be the width of a finger. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 671:18)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn775">7. This is true only when the cover was in place before the wicks were lit but if they were lit and then covered, they must be extinguished, covered and then relit. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 671:13)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn776">8. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> comments that this is true when there are only two branches in the <italic>Menorah</italic>. Our <italic>Menorohs</italic>, however, have eight branches and may be used simultaneously by two persons, each lighting at opposite ends. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 671:12)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn777">9. Those who follow the <italic>halachic</italic> decisions of the <italic>Vilna Gaon</italic>, customarily light the candles at sunset.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn778">10. It is forbidden to do any work from one half hour before the actual time for lighting. See (<italic>Shaar Hatzion</italic> 672:14) who indicates that this does not apply to Torah study.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn779">11. Those who pray <italic>Maariv</italic> before lighting should have the <italic>menorah</italic> completely prepared with oil and wicks in order to be able to light them immediately after <italic>Maariv</italic>. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 672:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn780">12. If you do not have sufficient oil to burn a half hour, you should light them without saying the berachah. (<italic>Biur Halachah</italic> 672:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn781">13. It is permitted in this situation only until day-break. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 672:11)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn782">14. You are also permitted to say the berachah. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 672:3)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn783">15. In this case, you must light candles anew but without a berachah. (<italic>Biur Halachah</italic> 672:2)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn784">16. However, if for whatever reason you did not say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> on the first night, you should say it on the next night or whenever you are reminded. On the first night, however, if you remember after lighting the candles, you should not say <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> on that night but rather wait until the next night and say it when lighting the candles. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 671:2, <italic>Shaar Hatzion</italic> 3)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn785">17. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> rules that a convert may say [even initially] the berachah: &#x201C;Who has performed miracles for our fathers,&#x201D; like any other Jew. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 675:14)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn786">18. The <italic>Poskim</italic> have written that even when the <italic>Menorah</italic> was lit in a proper place, it should not be moved to another [proper] place until after the candles had burned at least a half hour. This applies even to the <italic>Menorah</italic> that is lit in the synagogue. Others are more stringent, maintaining that the <italic>menorah</italic> should not be moved at all while it is burning. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 675:6, See also <italic>Shaar Hatzion</italic> 672:12)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn787">19. You must extinguish the candles, add the proper amount of oil, and rekindle the candles, but without a berachah. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 675:8)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn788">20. Others are stringent, maintaining that this prohibition applies during the entire time they are burning. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 672:8)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn789">21. This applies even to the person who lights the <italic>Menorah</italic> in the synagogue. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 671:45)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn790">22. A mourner refers to one whose parents died within the past twelve months or within thirty days if he mourns for his wife, son, daughter, brother, or sister.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn791">23. He should, however, not say the <italic>berachos</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 675:10)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn792">24. According to most <italic>Poskim</italic>, however, if you have not yet accepted the Shabbos [mentally], even though you lit the Shabbos candles, you may still light the <italic>Chanukah</italic> candles. A woman who usually accepts the Shabbos when lighting candles, should not light <italic>Chanukah</italic> candles after she lit the Shabbos candles. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 679:1; See also <italic>Shaar Hatzion</italic> 679:2; See also <italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</italic> 75:5)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn793">25. See <italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</italic> Chapter 69:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn794">26. This ruling applies to weekdays as well. (See <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 680:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn795">27. According to <italic>Ramah</italic>, the precedure is reversed&#x2014;the <italic>Chanukah</italic> lights are kindled before the <italic>Havdalah</italic> is said. Everyone should adhere to the custom of the community. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 681:3)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn796">28. This is true only if you are certain that she is lighting them, but if you have any doubt, you should light them and say the <italic>berachos</italic>. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 677:8)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn797">29. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> based on <italic>Magein Avrohom</italic> writes that if they have a private room it is best that they light themselves rather than joining in partnership with the head of household. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 677:7, 8)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn798">30. However, after concluding <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>, before saying, <italic>Yehe Leratzon</italic> (May there be pleased acceptance), you should say a prayer that the Almighty should perform miracles and wonders for us as He did for our ancestors in those days in this time, in the days of Matisyahu etc. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 682:4)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn799">31. At least seven men should be called up to read from the first <italic>seifer Torah</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 684:5)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 140 The Order of the Four Parshiyos</title>
<p>1) The Shabbos before <italic>Rosh Chodesh Adar</italic> that is closest to the month of <italic>Nisan</italic>, is [called] Shabbos, <italic>Parashas Shekalim</italic>. If <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> occurs on Shabbos, then that Shabbos is <italic>Parashas Shekalim</italic>. We take out three <italic>sifrei Torah</italic>. We call six persons to the first <italic>seifer Torah</italic>, for the reading of the weekly portion. In the second <italic>seifer Torah</italic> we call a seventh person for the reading of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>, beginning with <italic>Uve&#x2019;yom haShabbos</italic>. Then <italic>half-kaddish</italic> is said<sup><xref rid="fn801">1</xref></sup> (see Chaper 78:1 and 79:1 above). In the third <italic>seifer Torah</italic> we read the <italic>Maftir</italic> of <italic>Parashas Shekalim</italic>, [Exodus 30:11&#x2013;16], and the <italic>Haftarah</italic> of <italic>Parashas Shekalim</italic> is read. If by mistake they began to read the section of <italic>Parashas Shekalim</italic> first, they should finish reading it,<sup><xref rid="fn802">2</xref></sup> and for <italic>Maftir</italic> they should read the section of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>, and the <italic>Haftarah</italic>, too, is that of Shabbos <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>.</p>
<p>2) The Shabbos before <italic>Purim</italic> is [called] Shabbos, <italic>Parashas Zachor</italic>. The Shabbos before <italic>Rosh Chodesh Nisan</italic> is Shabbos, <italic>Parashas Hachodesh</italic>. If <italic>Rosh Chodesh Nisan</italic> occurs on Shabbos, then that Shabbos is <italic>Parashas Hachodesh</italic>, and it is governed by the same <italic>Halachos</italic> as apply when <italic>Rosh Chodesh Adar</italic> occurs on Shabbos. The Shabbos before <italic>Parashas Hachodesh</italic> is Shabbos, <italic>Parashas Parah</italic>.</p>
<p>3) Some authorities maintain that <italic>Parashas Zachor</italic> and <italic>Parashas Parah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn803">3</xref></sup> are obligated to be read, according to Scriptural law, and a minor should not be called for the <italic>maftir</italic> [reading of those <italic>parshiyos</italic>]. People living in villages who have no <italic>minyan</italic><sup><xref rid="fn804">4</xref></sup> are required to go to a place where there is a <italic>minyan</italic>. If that is impossible, they should at least read these [special portions] with the proper cantillation chant.</p>
<ftnote id="fn801">1. The third <italic>seifer Torah</italic> is placed next to the second one when the <italic>half-kaddish</italic> is said. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 685:5)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn802">2. This ruling applies to Shabbos, <italic>Parashas Hachodesh</italic> as well. (<italic>Ibid</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn803">3. Many of the later <italic>Poskim</italic> agree that the obligation to read <italic>Parashas Parah</italic> is not ordained by Scriptural law. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 685:15)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn804">4. This applies even if they have a <italic>seifer Torah</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 685:16)</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 141 Laws Concerning the Reading of the Megillah</title>
<p>1) The Month of <italic>Adar</italic> brings much joy to our people. If a Jew has a lawsuit against a non-Jew he should bring the case to court during this month.</p>
<p>2) In the days of Mordechai and Esther, the Jews joined together on the thirteenth day of <italic>Adar</italic> to defend themselves and take revenge against their enemies. They had to ask for compassion from God, blessed is His Name, that He should help them. And we find that whenever the Jewish people were at war they fasted, in order to invoke Divine assistance. Moshe Rabeinu, peace be upon him, also fasted on the day he went into battle against Amalek. This being the case, we may assume, that in the days of Mordechai and Esther, they also fasted on the thirteenth day of <italic>Adar</italic>. Therefore, all Jews have accepted this day as a public fast day. It is called <italic>Ta&#x2019;anis Esther</italic> [Fast of Esther]. It is meant to remind us that the Creator, blessed is His Name, sees and hears the prayers of every person in his time of trouble, when he fasts and repents with all his heart, as He answered our forefathers in those days. Nevertheless, this fast is not as obligatory as the four fast days mentioned in <italic>Tanach</italic> (see Chapter 121 above). Therefore, you may be lenient when it is necessary. Thus pregnant and nursing women, or even a person who is slightly ill with an eye irritation should not fast, if fasting would be greatly discomforting to them.<sup><xref rid="fn805">1</xref></sup> A woman within thirty days after giving birth, and a bridegroom during his seven days of <italic>Sheva berachos</italic>, do not have to fast, but they should make up for it later.<sup><xref rid="fn806">2</xref></sup> But all others who are in good health should not separate themselves from the community. Even if you are traveling and fasting is difficult, nevertheless, you are required to fast.</p>
<p>3) On the fourteenth day of <italic>Adar, Purim</italic> is celebrated in unwalled cities. If <italic>Purim</italic> occurs on a Sunday, the fast is moved up to Thursday. If there is a <italic>bris</italic> [circumcision] on [Thursday], the <italic>bris</italic> meal should be held at night, but the <italic>sandek</italic> and the father of the infant<sup><xref rid="fn807">3</xref></sup> are permitted to eat during the day, and they do not have to fast on Friday. But if anyone else forgets and eats on Thursday, he must fast on Friday.</p>
<p>4) In honor of [reading] the <italic>Megillah</italic> you should wear Shabbos clothes in the evening, and when returning from the synagogue, you should find the house brightly lit, the table set, and the beds made. In the evening, after the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>, the <italic>Full Kaddish</italic> with <italic>Tiskabbeil</italic> is said, then the <italic>Megillah</italic> is read. After that, <italic>Ve&#x2019;ata kadosh</italic> etc. is said. (This verse is found in Psalm 22:4, &#x201C;For the Conductor; on the <italic>ayeles hashachar</italic>,&#x201D; which refers to Esther. It is said (verse 3), &#x201C;My God, I call&#x2026;&#x201D; etc. which refers to the reading of the <italic>Megillah</italic>. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, Every man must read the <italic>Megillah</italic> at night and repeat it in the daytime, for it is said, &#x201C;My God, I call by day, but you do not answer, and at night I am not silent.&#x201D; This is followed by [the verse], &#x201C;You are the Holy One&#x201D; etc.). After that, the <italic>Full Kaddish</italic>, is said, omitting <italic>Tiskabbeil</italic>. If it is Shabbos night [we say], <italic>Vihi no&#x2019;am, Ve&#x2019;ata kadosh</italic>, the <italic>Full Kaddish</italic> omitting <italic>Tiskabbeil, Veyiten lecha;</italic> and we say <italic>Havdalah</italic> over a cup of wine, [and conclude with] <italic>Aleinu</italic>.</p>
<p>5) It is customary to donate a coin, equal to half of the standard monetary unit currently in use in the country before <italic>Purim</italic>, as a reminder of the half-<italic>shekel</italic>, the Jews used to give in <italic>Adar</italic> to buy the communal offerings. It is customary to give three half-<italic>shekels</italic>, because in <italic>Parashas Ki Sisa</italic>, the word <italic>terumah</italic> [offering] is mentioned three times. These coins are given in the evening before the reading of the <italic>Megillah</italic>, and then distributed to the poor. A minor is exempt [from giving the half-<italic>shekel</italic>]; but if his father once contributed for him, it remains his obligation for life. According to some authorities, a thirteen year old boy must give [a half-<italic>shekel</italic>], while others hold that he is exempt until he reaches the age of twenty.</p>
<p>6) On <italic>Purim</italic>, in the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic> of <italic>Maariv, Shacharis</italic>, and <italic>Minchah</italic>, we recite <italic>Al hanisim</italic> [For the miracles]. If you forgot to say it, the same <italic>Halachah</italic> applies as on <italic>Chanukah</italic>. [See Chapter 139:21)</p>
<p>7) It is an obligation upon everyone, both men and women, to hear the reading of the <italic>Megillah</italic> in the evening and during the day. Therefore, girls too, should go to the synagogue. If they do not go someone must read for them at home. Children too, must be trained to hear the reading of the <italic>Megillah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn808">4</xref></sup> Nevertheless, you should not bring very young children to the synagogue since they disturb the congregation.</p>
<p>8) At night it is forbidden to read the <italic>Megillah</italic> before the stars come out, even if you suffer great discomfort because of the fast. But you may taste something<sup><xref rid="fn809">5</xref></sup> before the reading of the <italic>Megillah</italic>, such as coffee, and similar beverages, to strengthen yourself from the exhaustion of the fast.</p>
<p>9) The mitzvah done to perfection is to hear the <italic>Megillah</italic> in the synagogue, where there is a large number of people,<sup><xref rid="fn810">6</xref></sup> for &#x201C;In the multitude of people is the splendor of the King&#x201D; (Proverbs 14:28). You should at least make an effort to hear it read with a <italic>minyan</italic>. If it is impossible to have it read with a <italic>minyan</italic>, each individual should read it from a valid <italic>Megillah</italic>, and recite the <italic>berachos</italic> before the reading. If one of them knows how to read it and the others do not, then the one who knows it should read and the others should listen and fulfill their obligation in this manner, even though they are not a <italic>minyan</italic>. However, the berachah after the <italic>Megillah</italic> reading should be said only when there is a <italic>minyan</italic>. However, without mentioning God&#x2019;s name and Kingship [i.e., <italic>Elokeinu melech ha&#x2019;olam</italic>], even an individual may recite the berachah.</p>
<p>10) It is a custom, accepted in all Yisrael, that the reader does not read from a rolled up <italic>Megillah</italic>, but he spreads it out and folds it, section over section,<sup><xref rid="fn811">7</xref></sup> like a letter, because the <italic>Megillah</italic> is called <italic>Igeres haPurim</italic> [the letter of Purim]; but those who listen, do not have to spread out their <italic>Megillos</italic>.</p>
<p>11) The person who reads the <italic>Megillah</italic>, whether in the daytime or at night, recites three <italic>berachos</italic> before the reading: <italic>Al mikra Megillah</italic> [&#x2026; concerning the mitzvah of reading the <italic>Megillah</italic>], <italic>She&#x2019;asa nisim</italic>, [Who made miracles] and <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> [Who kept us alive]. After the reading, he rolls it up completely and places it in front of him. Then [everyone] says the berachah <italic>Harav es riveinu</italic>, [Who fights for us] etc. If a mourner reads the <italic>Megillah</italic>, someone else should say the <italic>berachos</italic>, because of the <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> [which a mourner should not say publicly]. (See 139:15)</p>
<p>12) When <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic> is said in the daytime you should also have in mind [to exempt with this berachah] the mitzvos of sending <italic>Mishloach Manos</italic> [gifts of food], <italic>Matanos La&#x2019;evyonim</italic> [gifts to the poor], and <italic>Se&#x2019;udas Purim</italic> [the <italic>Purim</italic> feast]. The reader, too, [when saying <italic>Shehecheyanu</italic>], should have the congregation in mind for these mitzvos as well.</p>
<p>13) The reader of the <italic>Megillah</italic> must have in mind to fulfill the mitzvah on behalf of all the listeners. The listeners, too, must have in mind to fulfill their obligation [with his reading] and they must listen to every word. If you failed to hear even one word you have not fulfilled your obligation. The reader, therefore, must be very alert, during the noise making and the confusion, when the name of <italic>Haman</italic> is mentioned, to remain silent until the commotion has passed completely. Nevertheless, it is proper and fitting to have a valid [handwritten] <italic>Megillah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn812">8</xref></sup> so that you can say word for word quietly, in case you do not hear one word from the reader. Also, every intelligent woman who is in the women&#x2019;s section is encouraged, if possible, to obtain a valid <italic>Megillah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn812">8</xref></sup> from which to read, for in the [women&#x2019;s section] it is difficult to hear [the reading]; and women are obligated [to hear the <italic>Megillah</italic>] the same as men. (If <italic>kiddush levanah</italic> [Sanctification of the Moon] has not yet been said, and it became visible during the reading of the <italic>Megillah</italic>, see the end of Chapter 97 above [for instructions].)</p>
<p>14) The reader must recite the names of the ten sons of <italic>Haman</italic>, including the word <italic>aseres</italic> [ten], all in one breath, to make it known that they were all killed and hanged simultaneously. It is customary [at least] initially to recite from <italic>chameish meios ish</italic> [Five hundred men] all in one breath. If he has already read the names, then even if he paused while reciting the names of the ten sons of <italic>Haman</italic>, he has fulfilled his obligation. The custom followed in some communities, that the entire congregation says the names of the sons of <italic>Haman</italic>, is not correct. Rather the reader should recite them, and the congregation should listen as they do for the entire <italic>Megillah</italic>. When the reader says the verse, &#x201C;That night the king could not sleep well&#x201D; (6:1) he should raise his voice, for there the actual miracle begins; and when he says <italic>&#x201C;Ha&#x2019;igeres hazos,&#x201D;</italic> [this letter] (9:26) he should [gently] shake the <italic>Megillah</italic>.</p>
<p>15) If you have a <italic>Megillah</italic> that is invalid, or a <italic>Chumash</italic>, you should not say the words along with the reader, because if you say the words while reading, you cannot concentrate on listening to the reader. And even if you, yourself, could concentrate [on the reader&#x2019;s recitation], someone else might listen to your reading and not concentrate on the reader&#x2019;s recitation. For the same reason, no one should assist the reader from memory. Therefore, the four &#x201C;verses of redemption&#x201D; [Verse 2:5, <italic>Ish Yehudi</italic>&#x2014;There was a Jewish man, v. 8:15, <italic>uMordechai yatzah</italic>&#x2014;Mordechai left, v. 8:16, <italic>LaYehudim hayesa</italic>&#x2014;The Jews had light, v. 10:3, <italic>Ki Mordechai HaYehudi</italic>&#x2014;For Mordechai the Jew,] which the congregation recites in a loud voice, must be repeated by the reader and read from the valid <italic>Megillah</italic>.</p>
<p>16) Someone who has already fulfilled the Mitzvah of reading the <italic>Megillah</italic>, may read in order to exempt someone else. If the one for whose benefit he reads knows how to say the <italic>berachos</italic>, then he should say the <italic>berachos</italic>. If [he reads it for] a woman, it is preferable that the reader says the following berachah: <italic>Asher kiddeshanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu lishmo&#x2019;a megillah</italic>. [Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us to hear the <italic>Megillah</italic>].</p>
<p>17) On Shabbos (on which <italic>Purim</italic> never occurs) it is permissible to handle the <italic>Megillah</italic>. Nevertheless, if <italic>Purim</italic> occurs on Sunday, you should not bring the <italic>Megillah</italic> to the synagogue on Shabbos even in a city which has an <italic>eiruv</italic>, because it is preparing on Shabbos for a weekday.</p>
<p>18) If a congregation has no reader capable of reading the <italic>Megillah</italic> with the proper cantillation chant, it may be read without the chant, provided the words are properly pronounced, so that the meaning is not changed. For, if instead of reading <italic>uMordechai yosheiv</italic> (is sitting) [it was read] <italic>yashav</italic> (sat) or instead of [reading] <italic>veHaman nofeil</italic> [Haman is falling], it was read <italic>nafal</italic> [fell], or the like, even post facto, the mitzvah is not fulfilled.<sup><xref rid="fn813">9</xref></sup> It is permissible to insert vowels and cantillation marks in the <italic>Megillah</italic>, so that it should be read correctly, since it is an extreme circumstance; and this is better than having someone prompt [the reader] from of a <italic>chumash</italic>, whispering quietly, because the prompter, who is reading out of a <italic>chumash</italic>, even if he reads in an undertone, cannot concentrate on listening to the reader&#x2019;s recitation. The result is, that he only reads it out of a <italic>chumash</italic>, and has not fulfilled the mitzvah. If this happened [the prompter] must hear it again read out of a valid <italic>Megillah</italic>.</p>
<p>19) If a congregation does not have a <italic>halachically</italic> valid <italic>Megillah</italic>, nevertheless, if it is written on parchment according to <italic>Halachah</italic>, except that some words are missing in mid text, since no complete subject is missing, it may be read from, and the <italic>berachos</italic> may be said over it. The reader should say the missing words from memory or someone should prompt him quietly from a <italic>chumash</italic>. But if they have no <italic>Megillah</italic> at all, or if an entire subject is missing, or if the first or last [verses] are missing, then each person should read from a <italic>chumash</italic> without saying the <italic>berachos</italic>. An individual who has only a <italic>Megillah</italic> that is not valid should read in it, without saying the <italic>berachos</italic>.</p>
<p>20) A mourner during the <italic>shivah</italic> should observe all the <italic>Halachos</italic> of mourning, and he is forbidden to attend any kind of celebration; but wearing shoes and sitting on a chair are permitted [to him on <italic>Purim</italic>], because these are things that everyone can see.<sup><xref rid="fn814">10</xref></sup> At night, if he can gather a <italic>minyan</italic> in his house to read the <italic>Megillah</italic>, that is preferable; if not, he should pray at home and go to the synagogue to hear the <italic>Megillah</italic>. If <italic>Purim</italic> occurs on Shabbos night, he should go to the synagogue after <italic>Shalosh Seudos</italic> [the third meal] while it is still day. On <italic>Purim</italic>-day he may go to the synagogue to pray and to hear the <italic>Megillah</italic>.</p>
<p>21) If someone lost a close relative on the Fast of Esther and at night he is an <italic>onein</italic>, since the burial has not yet taken place, he should hear the <italic>Megillah</italic> read by someone else; and he should not eat meat nor drink wine, since at night feasting is not mandatory. In the daytime, after leaving the synagogue, the dead should be buried. Afterwards he should pray,<sup><xref rid="fn815">11</xref></sup> and either read the <italic>Megillah</italic> himself or hear someone else read it. If he heard the reading of the <italic>Megillah</italic> before the burial, he has fulfilled his obligation. Nevertheless, it is proper that he read it again without saying the <italic>berachos</italic>. He should not put on the <italic>tefillin</italic> even after the burial, because it is the first day of mourning. An <italic>onein</italic>, on <italic>Purim</italic> during the daytime, is permitted to eat meat and drink wine.<sup><xref rid="fn816">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>22) In the morning [it is proper] to get up early to go to the synagogue. After the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei, half-kaddish</italic> is said. We call up three persons for the Torah-reading of <italic>Parashas Vayavo Amalek</italic> [And Amelek came] [Ex. 17:8), after which <italic>half-kaddish</italic> is said. After the <italic>seifer Torah</italic> is placed in the Ark, the <italic>Megillah</italic> is read. After the last berachah [over the <italic>Megillah</italic>], in the morning, we do not say <italic>Asher heini</italic> [Who annuls the counsel of the nations]. After concluding the berachah with <italic>hakeil hamoshia</italic> [the God Who brings salvation] we say <italic>Shoshanas Yaakov</italic> [The rose of Jacob] etc. then <italic>Ashrei, Uva leTzion, Full-Kaddish</italic> including <italic>Tiskabbeil</italic>. You should not take off the <italic>tefillin</italic> until after the reading of the <italic>Megillah</italic>, because in the <italic>Megillah</italic> it is written, <italic>Vikar</italic> [and honor] (8:16), and [our Rabbis] expound that this refers to the <italic>tefillin</italic>. If there is a <italic>bris</italic>, it is performed before<sup><xref rid="fn817">13</xref></sup> the reading of the <italic>Megillah</italic>, because it is written <italic>vesason</italic> [gladness], which refers to <italic>bris milah</italic>.</p>
<p>23) In a city that has been surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua the son of Nun, the <italic>Megillah</italic> is read on the fifteenth of <italic>Adar</italic> (such cities do not exist in our regions).</p>
<ftnote id="fn805">1. This refers only to one who has an eye irritation, but a pregnant or nursing woman need not fast even though they feel no discomfort. This is the opinion of <italic>Yeshuos Yaakov</italic>, but <italic>Eliyahu Rabbah</italic> disagrees and maintains that they are exempt only when they feel discomfort. However, regarding a woman within thirty days after childbirth, even <italic>Eliyahu Rabbah</italic> is lenient and agrees with <italic>Yeshuos Yaakov</italic>. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 686:4, 5)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn806">2. This refers only to one who did not fast because of an eye irritation. See note 1 above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn807">3. According to <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> the mother of the child and the <italic>Mohel</italic> are also permitted to eat during the day. (See <italic>Shaar Hatzion</italic> 686:15)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn808">4. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> writes: &#x201C;Presently in our times the result of bringing children to the synagogue has had a reverse effect. Not only do they not listen to the reading of the <italic>Megillah</italic>, they create such a tumult that the adults are unable to hear the reading properly. Their purpose in coming is only to make noise at the mention of Haman&#x2019;s name, and as such, the father does not fulfill his obligation of <italic>chinuch</italic>, (training his child to perform mitzvos.) In truth, therefore, a father must keep his children near him and to see that they actually listen to the <italic>Megillah</italic> reading, and though they are permitted to make noise at the mention of Haman&#x2019;s name, this should not be the primary reason for their coming to the synagogue. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 689:18)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn809">5. You may eat a <italic>kebeitzah</italic> of bread or cake, or liquid in the same quantity. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 692:14)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn810">6. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> quotes <italic>Chayei Adam</italic> who wrote that if you pray all year with a specific <italic>minyan</italic>, you need not leave it to go to a synagogue where there are more people. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> comments that <italic>Chayei Adam&#x2019;s</italic> ruling applies only when the <italic>minyan</italic> is held in a <italic>Beis Midrash</italic>, but if the minyan is held in a private home, it would seem that you should leave and go to the synagogue to hear the <italic>Megillah</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 687:7)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn811">7. This should be done before he says the <italic>berachos</italic> so that there will be no interruption between the <italic>berachos</italic> and the reading. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 690:56)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn812">8. If you have no valid handwritten <italic>Megillah</italic>, you should at least have a printed <italic>Megillah</italic> to read from. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 690:19)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn813">9. In such a case, the <italic>Megillah</italic> must be re-read from the place the mistake was made, but a new berachah is not said. This rule also applies if an entire word was omitted. (<italic>Biur Halachah</italic> 690:14)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn814">10. Only very private practices of mourning are permitted on <italic>Purim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn815">11. However, before the burial he is exempt from the mitzvah to read <italic>Kerias Shemah</italic> and to pray the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>. (<italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</italic> 196:7)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn816">12. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> disagrees with this ruling, maintaining that he is not permitted to eat meat or drink wine even by day. ( <italic>Shaar Hatzion</italic> 696:28)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn817">13. According to <italic>Pri Chadosh</italic> and <italic>Vilna Gaon</italic>, the <italic>Megillah</italic> is read before the <italic>bris</italic>. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 693:12)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 142 Laws Concerning the Sending of Gifts of Food, Gifts to the Needy and the Seudas Purim, Purim Feast</title>
<p>1) [On Purim] everyone is required to send<sup><xref rid="fn818">1</xref></sup> no less than two gifts to one person; as it is written, &#x201C;And sending gifts of food to one another&#x201D; (9:22); which implies two gifts to one person. The more gifts you send to your friends the more praiseworthy you are. Nevertheless, it is much better to give generously to the poor than to have a lavish feast and to send extravagant gifts to your friends; for there is no greater and more glorious joy before the Holy One, blessed is He, than to gladden the hearts of the poor, the orphans and the widows. Whoever gladdens the hearts of these unfortunates is compared to the Divine Presence, for it is said, (Isaiah 57:15) &#x201C;To revive the spirit of the humble and revive the heart of the crushed.&#x201D;</p>
<p>2) The term <italic>Mishlo&#x2019;ach manos</italic> implies only food that is ready-to-eat without preparation [by the recipient], such as cooked meat or fish, but not if it is uncooked.<sup><xref rid="fn819">2</xref></sup> Candy, fruits, wine, mead,<sup><xref rid="fn820">3</xref></sup> or similar [delicacies are acceptable].</p>
<p>3) Everybody, even the poorest in Yisrael, who is a recipient of charity, is required to give at least two gifts to two poor persons, that is, one gift to each person, for it is written, <italic>Matanos l&#x2019;evyonim</italic> &#x201C;And gifts to the poor,&#x201D; (9:22) [<italic>leveyonim</italic> is a plural] which implies, two gifts to two poor people. You should not be selective when giving charity on <italic>Purim;</italic> whoever holds out his hand to ask for charity should be given a donation. If you are in a community where there are no poor people, you should either keep the money until you meet needy persons, or send it to them.</p>
<p>4) Women, too, are required to send <italic>mishlo&#x2019;ach manos</italic> [gifts of food] and to give gifts to the poor. Women should send <italic>mishlo&#x2019;ach manos</italic> to women and men to men. But regarding donations to the poor, women may send to men, and conversely, [men may send to women]. Some women rely that their husbands give on their behalf as well, but this is not proper; rather they should be stringent about this.</p>
<p>5) It is an obligation to eat, drink and to rejoice on <italic>Purim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn821">4</xref></sup> Also on the night of the fourteenth you should rejoice and have a more elaborate meal [than usual]. If <italic>Purim</italic> occurs on Shabbos night, although you must have a third meal on Shabbos, you should eat a little less during the day<sup><xref rid="fn822">5</xref></sup> to leave some appetite for the meal of <italic>Purim</italic> night. Nevertheless, by having a meal at night you have not fulfilled the mitzvah [of <italic>se&#x2019;udas Purim</italic>, the <italic>Purim</italic> feast]; for the mitzvah if to have the main <italic>Purim</italic> feast during the daytime, for it is written, &#x201C;<italic>Days</italic> of feasting.&#x201D; You should light candles as you do on joyous occasions and Yom Tov, even when the meal is held in the daytime. Also on the night of the fifteenth you should celebrate a little. Giving gifts to the poor and sending <italic>mishlo&#x2019;ach manos</italic> to friends must be done during the daytime. Since people are busy [preparing and delivering] <italic>mishlo&#x2019;ach manos</italic>, part of the <italic>Purim se&#x2019;udah</italic> may extend into the night. You should pray <italic>Minchah</italic> while it is still the middle of the day, and have the <italic>se&#x2019;udah</italic> after <italic>Minchah</italic>. At any rate, you should have the greater part of the <italic>se&#x2019;udah</italic> while it is still day. When <italic>Purim</italic> occurs on <italic>erev Shabbos</italic>, you should have the <italic>se&#x2019;udah</italic> in the morning, out of respect for Shabbos. It is commendable to devote some time to Torah study, before beginning the <italic>se&#x2019;udah</italic>. This is based [on the verse] &#x201C;The Jews had light,&#x201D; (8:16) and [our Rabbis] expound, &#x201C;light&#x201D; means Torah. Some authorities, say that you should eat different kinds of seeds on <italic>Purim</italic>, to commemorate the seeds Daniel and his friends ate in Babylon, and also to remember the seeds that Esther ate. For the Talmud (<italic>Maseches Megillah</italic> 16b) states, [it is written] &#x201C;He favored her and her maids with preferential treatment&#x2026;&#x201D; (2:9) [this means], that he gave her seeds for her food. (For the laws of <italic>Al hanisim</italic> in <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, see Chapter 44:16, 17.)</p>
<p>6) Since the entire miracle of <italic>Purim</italic> was brought about through wine: Vashti was banished at the wine party, and Esther took her place; also the episode of Haman&#x2019;s downfall came about through wine; therefore, our Rabbis of blessed memory mandated that everyone should become intoxicated with wine, and they said, &#x201C;It is an obligation to become intoxicated on <italic>Purim</italic>, until you cannot tell the difference between &#x2018;Cursed be Haman&#x2019; and &#x2018;Blessed be Mordechai.&#x2019;&#x201D; At least you should drink more than you usually do, to recall the great miracle, until you fall asleep; and once you are asleep, you can no longer tell the difference between &#x201C;Cursed is Haman&#x201D; and &#x201C;Blessed is Mordechai.&#x201D; However, if a person is physically frail, and similarly, if you know that as a result of [drinking] you will, God forbid, ignore a mitzvah, a berachah, or a prayer, or that it would lead to lightheaded exuberance, it is better not to become drunk. All your deeds should be for the sake of Heaven.</p>
<p>7) A mourner, even during the week of <italic>shivah</italic> is required to give gifts to the poor, and to send <italic>mishlo&#x2019;ach manos</italic> to his friends. Nevertheless, he should not send anything that generates happiness. But you should not send <italic>mishlo&#x2019;ach manos</italic> to a mourner the entire twelve months [of mourning],<sup><xref rid="fn823">6</xref></sup> [this includes] even things that do not generate joyousness. If [the mourner] is a poor person you may send him money or anything that will not produce joy. If in an area where the only residents are a mourner and one other person, he must send <italic>mishlo&#x2019;ach manos</italic> to [the mourner] in order to fulfill the mitzvah of <italic>mishlo&#x2019;ach manos</italic>. (For the laws of <italic>onein</italic> see Chapter 141:21 above).</p>
<p>8) You should not do any work on <italic>Purim</italic>. Whoever performs work on that day, will never see any blessing from that work. But it is permitted to have a non-Jew work for you. You are allowed to attend to business.<sup><xref rid="fn824">7</xref></sup> You may write even a social letter, and [make an entry of] money you owe, or [write] anything that does not require much concentration. You are certainly [permitted] to write for the sake of a mitzvah or to do any work for the purpose of a mitzvah. For the needs of <italic>Purim</italic>, you are permitted to do even full-scale labor.</p>
<p>9) The fifteenth day of <italic>Adar</italic> is called <italic>Shushan Purim</italic>. We do not say <italic>Tachanun</italic> on that day, nor <italic>Keil erech apayim</italic> nor <italic>Lamenatzei&#x2019;ach</italic>. On this day it is also forbidden to deliver eulogies or to fast. It is the custom to celebrate on that day by feasting and rejoicing in moderation; but we do not say <italic>Al hanisim</italic>, and weddings may be performed because the <italic>Megillah</italic> is not read [on <italic>Shushan Purim</italic>.] However, [on <italic>Purim</italic>], when the <italic>Megillah</italic> is read which is the paramount time of joy, weddings should not be held, because we do not merge one joyous event with another.</p>
<p>10) On the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the first <italic>Adar</italic> (in a leap year), likewise, we do not say <italic>Tachanun</italic>, nor <italic>Keil erech apayim</italic>, nor <italic>Lamenatzei&#x2019;ach</italic>, and it is forbidden to deliver eulogies or fast on these days, and on the fourteenth our meal should be a little more elaborate.</p>
<ftnote id="fn818">1. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> questions if the mitzvah is fulfilled if you give the gift directly to the recipient, without a messenger. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 695:18)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn819">2. Some <italic>Poskim</italic> rule that since raw meat or chicken is ready for the pot, it is permitted. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 695:20)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn820">3. One article of food and a beverage is sufficient for the fulfillment of the mitzvah. (<italic>Ibid</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn821">4. It is proper to gather your family and friends because it is impossible to rejoice yourself. It must, however, be a joy that is in the spirit of Torah. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 695:9)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn822">5. This ruling is not mentioned in <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic>, on the contrary he writes (<italic>Ibid</italic> 695:3) &#x201C;Even though you had a large meal for <italic>Shalosh Seudos</italic>, nevertheless, you should have a larger than usual meal at night.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn823">6. This refers only to a mourner for his father or mother. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> rules this applies only where it is customary not to greet a mourner during the twelve months of mourning. However, where it is the custom to greet mourners you may also send them <italic>mishlo&#x2019;ach manos</italic> on Purim during the twelve months. During the first thirty days of mourning it is definitely not permitted to send them <italic>mishlo&#x2019;ach manos</italic>. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 696:20, 21)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn824">7. For this is a source of joy. In the case of one who must work in order to provide for his family&#x2019;s needs, he too is permitted to work. (<italic>Ibid</italic> 696:2, 3)</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 143 Honoring Father and Mother</title>
<p>1) You must be extremely careful to honor and revere your father and mother for Scripture compares their honor and reverence to the honor and reverence you must have for the Almighty. It is written, &#x201C;Honor your father and mother;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn825">1</xref></sup> It is also written, &#x201C;Honor Hashem with your substance.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn826">2</xref></sup> With regards to your father and mother it is written, &#x201C;Every man must revere his mother and his father;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn827">3</xref></sup> and it is written, &#x201C;You shall fear Adonoy your God.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn828">4</xref></sup> Just as He commanded us to honor and fear His great Name so He commanded us to honor and revere them. Three partners share in the formation of man: The Holy One, Blessed is He, his father, and his mother. (The man contributes, the woman contributes, and the Holy One, Blessed is He, breathes a soul into him, endows him with eye sight, hearing and speech.) When man honors his father and mother, the Holy One, Blessed is He, says, &#x201C;I account it to them as though I dwelt among them, and they honored Me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>2) How are they to be revered? You must not occupy his [your father&#x2019;s] designated place in the council of elders and with his friends, or the designated place in which he prays, and you must not sit in his designated place at his dining table. You must not contradict his words, or even corroborate his words in his presence, even to say &#x201C;Father is right.&#x201D; To what extent must you revere them? If you were dressed in costly clothing and presiding over the assembly and your father or mother came and tore your clothing, struck you on the head and spat in your face, you must not embarrass them, or show distress in their presence or anger towards them; but you must be silent and fear the King who is King of Kings, the Holy One, Blesed is He, Who so commanded.<sup><xref rid="fn829">5</xref></sup> But you may summon them to Beis Din for the damages they inflicted on you.</p>
<p>3) How are they to be honored? You should provide them with food and drink, with clothing and shelter, escort them to their home and escort them from their home. You must provide these services cheerfully, for even if you provide them daily with choice poultry but do so with ill grace you will incur Divine punishment.</p>
<p>4) If your father or mother is asleep and the key to your store is under their pillow, it is forbidden to awaken them even if it means losing a large profit. However, if your father would profit by being awakened and if not awakened will be distressed by the loss of profit, it is a mitzvah to wake him since that will make him happy Likewise, it is a mitzvah to waken him to go to the synagogue or to perform any other mitzvah because everyone is obligated to honor the Holy One, Blessed is He.</p>
<p>5) If you need a favor from the townsmen and you know they will grant your wish for your father&#x2019;s sake, even though you know that they would also do it for your sake, you should not say, &#x201C;Do it for my sake,&#x201D; but rather, &#x201C;Do it for me for my father&#x2019;s sake,&#x201D; in order to attribute the honor to your father.</p>
<p>6) If you did something your mother told you to do and subsequently your father asks you, &#x201C;Who told you to do this?&#x201D; and you sense that if you said your mother told you, your father will be angry at your mother, you must not say to him that your mother told you to do it, even though as a result, your father will be angry with you.</p>
<p>7) You must stand up in the presence of your father and your mother.</p>
<p>8) You must honor your parents even after their death. If you mention them within twelve months after their passing, whether you do so orally or in writing you should say or write, &#x201C;May I be an atonement in his stead&#x201D; (i.e., I take (accept) upon myself all the evil [punishment] that would be inflicted upon his soul), or may I be an atonement in her stead. After twelve months have transpired (since he would have already received any punishment due him, for [even] the judgement in <italic>Gehinom</italic> of the wicked of Israel does not exceed twelve months), you should say or write, &#x201C;May his memory be a blessing in the life of the World to Come&#x201D; or &#x201C;May her memory be a blessing in the life of the World to Come.&#x201D;</p>
<p>9) Even if your father is wicked and a sinner you must honor and fear him.<sup><xref rid="fn830">6</xref></sup> Even a bastard is obligated to honor and fear his father. Others say<sup><xref rid="fn831">7</xref></sup> you need not honor your father, if he is wicked, so long as he did not repent, but you are forbidden to cause him grief. You should be stringent and follow the first opinion.</p>
<p>10) If you see your father transgress a Scriptural [Torah] Law, you must not say to him, &#x201C;You transgressed a Scriptural [Torah] Law.&#x201D; Rather say to him, &#x201C;Father, is such and such not written in the Torah,&#x201D; as though you are asking him a question and not as though you are admonishing him. Your father will then himself realize [his error] and thus will not be humiliated.</p>
<p>11) If your father told you to transgress a Scriptural Law whether it be a positive or negative command or even a Rabbinical injunction, you must not obey him, for it is written, &#x201C;Every man shall revere his mother and father and you shall preserve My Shabbos, I am Adonoy your God.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn832">8</xref></sup> Shabbos is positioned in the same verse [that instructs you to fear] your father and mother to teach: &#x201C;Even though I command you to fear your father and mother, if your parent tells you to desecrate the Shabbos you must not listen to him. This is true for all the mitzvos. [For] I am Adonoy your God. Both you and your father are bound to honor Me. You must therefore not listen to him to disregard My word.&#x201D; Rabbinical injunctions are also the commands of Hashem, Blessed be His Name, as it is written, &#x201C;You shall not turn aside,&#x201D; etc. If your father told you not to speak to a certain person, and not to forgive him; but you would like to be reconciled; you should not be concerned with your father&#x2019;s order, as you are forbidden to hate any Jew unless you see him commit a sin. Thus your father has ordered you to transgress a law of the Torah.</p>
<p>12) If you want to go to a certain place to study Torah because there you will accomplish more than you will here, and your father disapproves for some reason, you do not have to listen to your father, for learning Torah is greater than the precept of honoring father and mother. (Similarly, we find that when our father Yaakov, peace unto him, went away from [his father] Yitzchok, he secreted himself in the <italic>Beis Midrash</italic> of Eiver for 14 years and immersed himself in Torah study. Afterwards, he went to Lavan&#x2019;s house and stayed away twenty two years, including journey time. He was punished for the twenty two years during which he did not fulfill the mitzvah of honoring his father, and Joseph&#x2019;s whereabouts was concealed from Him for twenty-two years, but for the fournteen years during which he studied Torah, he was not punished.) If the son wishes to get married and the father disapproves he need not listen to him.</p>
<p>13) Both men and women are obligated to respect their father and mother. However, a married woman owes her devotion to her husband and is thus exempt from honoring her father and mother. But if her husband has no objection, she is obligated to honor them as much as possible.</p>
<p>14) Whoever disgraces his father or mother even by words or gesture is among those whom the Almighty has cursed. As it said,<sup><xref rid="fn833">9</xref></sup> &#x201C;Cursed is one who disgraces his father or mother.&#x201D;</p>
<p>15) If your parent has a splinter you should not remove it for you might thereby make a wound (which is a prohibition punishable by strangulation). Also, if the son is a doctor, he may not bleed them and may not perform surgery on them, even though his intent is to cure them. This is true only when someone else can do it. But if no one else is available to do it, and they are suffering, he may bleed them and operate, as is required for healing.</p>
<p>16) If senility or insanity should effect the mind of your father or mother, you should try to deal with them in accordance with their mental status until Hashem will have mercy on them. But if it is impossible for you to endure because of their severe retardation, you may leave them, and delegate others to take proper care of them.</p>
<p>17) It is forbidden to place a burdensome yoke on your children, and be exacting in demanding honor from them, so as not to cause them to sin. You should rather forgive them, and overlook things, for if a father waives his honor his honor is waived.<sup><xref rid="fn834">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>18) It is forbidden to hit your grown up son. Grown up, in this context, does not refer to age but on the nature of your son. If there is reason to believe he will attack you either verbally or physically, even if he is not yet Bar Mitzvah, you are forbidden to hit him.<sup><xref rid="fn835">11</xref></sup> Instead you should admonish him with words. Anyone who hits his grown up son is to be excommunicated<sup><xref rid="fn835">11</xref></sup> for he transgresses the Divine Command, &#x201C;Do not place a stumbling block before the blind.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn836">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>19) You must honor your father&#x2019;s wife even though she is not your mother, so long as your father is alive. You are also obligated to honor your mother&#x2019;s husband during your mother&#x2019;s lifetime, and it is proper to honor them even after the passing of your father or mother.</p>
<p>20) You must honor your older brother, regardless if he is a brother from your paternal or maternal parent. You must honor your father-in-law and your mother-in-law (as we find that King David, peace be upon him, honored King Saul, who was his father-in-law and called him, &#x201C;My father,&#x201D; as he said to him, &#x201C;My father, see and observe&#x201D;). You must honor your father&#x2019;s father<sup><xref rid="fn837">13</xref></sup> but honor due your father exceeds that of your grandfather.</p>
<p>21) One who truly wishes to honor his father and his mother should involve himself in Torah study and good deeds, for the greatest honor to parents is when people say, &#x201C;Fortunate are the father and mother who have reared such a son.&#x201D; If the son does not walk in the right path, his parents suffer humiliation because of him, and he embarrasses them with the utmost embarrassment. Also, the father who truly has compassion on his children will involve himself in Torah study and good deeds, and will please God and mankind, and his children will be proud of him. But he who does not walk in the right path brings disgrace on his children. Also children die because of the iniquity of their fathers as it is written,<sup><xref rid="fn838">14</xref></sup> &#x201C;Visiting the iniquity of fathers on children.&#x201D; There is no greater cruelty than causing his children to die of his sins. Nobody has more compassion on his children than the righteous man, for his merit endures for a thousand generations.</p>
<p>22) A convert must not curse his non-Jewish father and he must not humiliate him; in order that they not say: &#x201C;We came from a holiness [religion] that is significant to a holiness that is inferior.&#x201D; He should treat them with some degree of respect.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 144 Honor Due the Rebbe the Aged, the Scholar, and the Kohein.</title>
<p>1) You must honor and fear your <italic>Rebbe</italic> [teacher] more than your father, because your father [only] brought you to life in this world, but your <italic>Rebbe</italic> brings you to life in the World to Come.</p>
<p>2) It is written, &#x201C;In the presence of the elderly you shall rise and you shall respect an elder.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn839">1</xref></sup> &#x201C;An elder,&#x201D; in this context refers to a Torah scholar as it is said, &#x201C;Gather to me seventy men from the elders of Yisrael&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn840">2</xref></sup> (and there certainly the situation called for wisdom as it is written, &#x201C;Whom you know to be the elders of the people and its officers.&#x201D;)<sup><xref rid="fn840">2</xref></sup> Therefore, it is a positive command to rise before a Torah scholar who is distinguished in the knowledge of Torah, even if he is not advanced in years and is not your teacher. It is also a mitzvah to rise before an elderly person if he is at least seventy years old, even if he is an ignorant person, provided he is not a wicked person. Even to an elderly person who is not Jewish, you should talk respectfully and give him a helping hand.</p>
<p>3) When three people, (one of whom is a Rav,) are walking together, the Rav should walk in the middle. The other two should fall back slightly and walk at his side, the older one on the right and the younger one on the left.</p>
<p>4) It is a grave sin to humiliate <italic>talmidei chachomim</italic> or to hate them. Jerusalem was not destroyed until they began to humiliate <italic>talmidei chachomim</italic>, as it is said, &#x201C;But they mocked the messengers of God and disgraced His words, and scoffed at His prophets.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn841">3</xref></sup> That is to say they humiliated those who teach His words. This is also what the Torah says, &#x201C;And if you will despise My statutes,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn842">4</xref></sup> [that is to say] &#x201C;If you despise those who teach My statutes.&#x201D; And anyone who humiliates Torah scholars has no portion in the World to Come, and he is included among those of whom it is said: &#x201C;For He has denigrated the word of Adonoy.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn843">5</xref></sup> It is forbidden to make servile use of one who studies Torah laws.<sup><xref rid="fn844">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>5) If a Torah scholar has merchandise to sell we do not permit anyone to sell such merchandise until he sells his merchandise. This is true only when there is no gentile selling such merchandise. But if a gentile is selling [such merchandise] this is not so because the Torah scholar will not profit from this, and it will needlessly cause loss to the other Jews.</p>
<p>6) To be accepted as a Torah scholar in his generation,<sup><xref rid="fn845">7</xref></sup> one must be competent to discuss and debate topics of [the Written and Oral] Torah, and have proper understanding of most of the Talmud and Codes of Law, and Torah study is his main occupation. Even if he has a profession or a business with which to support himself, and provide the needs of his family, but not [necessarily] to amass wealth; and whenever he is free from his occupation he studies Torah; [if all these requirements apply to him then] according to the Law he is exempt from all forms of taxes and levies even if he is wealthy. And even the personal tax that is incumbent upon each person, the townsmen are obligated to pay for him. [However] everything is dependent on the discretion of the elected town leaders.<sup><xref rid="fn846">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>7) A scholar who slights the mitzvos and is not God-fearing, is to be treated like the insignificant men of the community.</p>
<p>8) When a <italic>kohein</italic> and an Israelite are equal in Torah scholarship it is a positive Scriptural mitzvah to give precedence to the <italic>kohein</italic>, as it is said, &#x201C;You shall sanctify Him.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn847">9</xref></sup> And our Rabbis, of blessed memory, explained that it refers to all matters of sanctity; that in all matters of importance he should be sanctified. He is to be called first to the Torah reading, and to be the first speaker at all public gatherings, and to speak first and expound on the Torah. He should also speak first in the yeshivah. Also at a meal, he is first to say the <italic>Berachah</italic> of <italic>Hamotzi</italic> and to lead the <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>. He should be given the choice portion before the others who are dining, unless an Israelite is present who is greater than him in Torah [learning], in which case you should give the scholar the choice portion.<sup><xref rid="fn848">10</xref></sup> But when a <italic>kohein</italic> divides a partnership with his friend, an Israelite, the Israelite need not give him the better share, for it is not honorable for the <italic>kohein</italic> to take the better share, for one who covets the better share will never see a sign of blessing. When a <italic>kohein</italic> is not present it is best to give preference to a Levi before an Israelite in all things mentioned here, if they are equal in Torah scholarship.</p>
<p>9) It is forbidden to make servile use of a <italic>kohein</italic>. This applies even in our time, and it is like taking unwarranted benefit of a sacred object. As it is said, &#x201C;You shall sanctify him for he offers the bread of your God.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn849">11</xref></sup> And even now though we have no sacrifices, he retains his sanctity. If the <italic>kohein</italic> wants to forego the honors due him, he may do so for the <italic>kehunah</italic> is his possession and he may forego its honors, and permit an Israelite to use him as a servant.<sup><xref rid="fn850">12</xref></sup> And certainly he may give the Israelite the honor of preceding him in the aforementioned matters.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 145 Laws Concerning Marriage</title>
<p>1) Every man is obligated to get married in order to fulfill the mitzvah of propagation. This mitzvah is incumbent on a man from the beginning of his eighteenth year<sup><xref rid="fn851">1</xref></sup>. At any rate, you should not pass your twentieth year without getting married. Only if you are diligently studying Torah and are afraid to marry in order not to be disrupted from learning Torah, are you permitted to delay marrying; and this is so, provided you are not overwhelmed with lustful desire.</p>
<p>2) When you have begotten a son and a daughter, you have fulfilled the mitzvah of propagation, provided the son is not impotent or the daughter sterile. If you had a son and a daughter who died, and they left surviving children, you have fulfilled the mitzvah of propagation. This is true only when the surviving grandchildren are a son and a daughter and were begotten from your son and your daughter, so that even if your son begot only a daughter, and your daughter begot only a son, since they come from your son and daughter, you have fulfilled the mitzvah of propagation. But if one of your children left no surviving children even though your other child left many surviving sons and daughters, you [the grandfather] have not fulfilled the mitzvah of propagation.</p>
<p>3) Even though you have fulfilled the mitzvah of propagation, you are forbidden to remain without a wife. You should marry a woman capable of bearing children if it is possible. But if you are aware that you are unable to have children, it is preferable that you marry a woman that is not able to bear children. Similarly, if you have many children, and you fear if you marry a woman capable of bearing children there will be bickering and quarrels between your children and your wife, you are permitted to marry a woman who is not capable of bearing children, but it is forbidden to remain unmarried because of this concern.</p>
<p>4) If a man takes a wife and she was with him ten years without bearing children, he should divorce her. Concerning this practice, there are many <italic>halachic</italic> details.</p>
<p>5) A woman is not commanded to fulfill the mitzvah of propagation. Nevertheless, she should not remain unmarried<sup><xref rid="fn852">2</xref></sup> so as not to be subject to suspicion.</p>
<p>6) Every man should try to marry a worthy woman from a respectable family. The Jewish people have three traits: they are modest, compassionate, and benevolent. A person lacking these traits is not a commendable partner for marriage.</p>
<p>7) If a woman is suitable, even if you marry her because of her wealth, it is permitted, but only when the money is given willingly. But if you defer marriage and wait until you find a woman with the money you desire; or if you agreed to a marriage and was promised a great deal of money, and the promise was retracted, and you abandon your bride because of this, or you quarrel over this, you are referred to as &#x201C;One who marries for money.&#x201D; You will have unworthy children, and will not be successful. Such a marriage will not be a happy one, for money that a man takes for marrying his wife is money not properly earned. But, rather, whatever is given to you by your father-in-law or mother-in-law you should accept graciously, and then you will be successful.</p>
<p>8) A man ignorant in Torah knowledge<sup><xref rid="fn853">3</xref></sup> should not marry the daughter of a <italic>kohein</italic> for such a marriage will not be a happy one. A scrupulous person should be particular not to marry a woman who has the same name as his mother.<sup><xref rid="fn854">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>9) It is a mitzvah to marry your sister&#x2019;s daughter or your brother&#x2019;s daughter. You should not marry any other relative, whether she is related to you or to your deceased or divorced wife, or she is related to the woman to whom you have given <italic>chalitzah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn855">5</xref></sup> without consulting an <italic>halachic</italic> authority</p>
<p>10) You should be ever careful to honor your wife, for blessing is not found in a person&#x2019;s home but for the wife&#x2019;s sake. And so the Sages said to the men of their time, &#x201C;Honor your wives so that you may be blessed with wealth.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn856">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>11) You may not dwell with your wife even for a short time without a <italic>kesubah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn857">7</xref></sup> If the <italic>kesubah</italic> is lost you must be very concerned and go immediately to the <italic>Beis Din</italic> to write another <italic>kesubah</italic> for her.</p>
<p>12) A <italic>kohein</italic> is forbidden to marry a divorc&#x00E9;e, a harlot, a <italic>chalalah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn858">8</xref></sup> or one to whom <italic>chalitzah</italic> was given. A woman is considered a harlot in this instance even if she was forced to have illicit intercourse and is forbidden to a <italic>kohein</italic>. A <italic>chalalah</italic> is a woman born to a <italic>kohein</italic> who married a woman forbidden to him.</p>
<p>13) Any woman who was widowed or divorced must wait ninety days<sup><xref rid="fn859">9</xref></sup> excluding the day of her divorce or her husband&#x2019;s death and excluding her wedding day before marrying another man. This is the <italic>halachah</italic> even if she is a woman incapable of bearing a child. Even if her first husband was overseas; or incarcerated in prison, it makes no difference. Even if she miscarried in the interim, it is to no avail. She is forbidden even to get engaged [during this waiting period,] unless her intended husband vows not to enter her house during this waiting period. But one who remarries his divorcee need not wait.</p>
<p>14) If the aforementioned woman is pregnant or is nursing an infant, she may not marry <italic>another</italic> man until the child is twenty four months old. Even if she gave birth after she was divorced or widowed and has not yet begun to nurse, she must wait. If a very important matter is involved, they should consult an <italic>halachic</italic> authority.</p>
<p>15) A woman whose two husbands died, should not marry a third one<sup><xref rid="fn860">10</xref></sup> without consulting an <italic>halachic</italic> authority.<sup><xref rid="fn861">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>16) If a woman heard that her husband died in some other place, even if she heard this from many trustworthy men, she should not remarry without consulting an <italic>halachic</italic> authority.</p>
<p>17) If a man is suspected of committing adultery with a married woman, and her husband divorced her or died, she is forbidden to [marry] that suspected man,<sup><xref rid="fn862">12</xref></sup> for just as she became forbidden to her husband, so too she is forbidden to the one who committed adultery with her. Even if her husband divorced her only because of improper conduct that was rumored about her regarding that suspected man, the suspect is forbidden to marry her.<sup><xref rid="fn863">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>18) One who is suspected of having intercourse with a non-Jewess, who subsequently converted to Judaism, is forbidden to marry her.</p>
<p>19) A non-Jew who had intercourse with a Jewess, and subsequently converted to Judaism, is forbidden to marry her.</p>
<p>20) If one divorces his wife so that she can marry a particular man, even though he did not expressly make this conditional but it is evident that this is the objective of the divorce, it is forbidden for that individual to marry her.</p>
<p>21) Those women whom the Sages, of blessed memory, have forbidden one to marry, may not dwell even in the closed alley in which he dwells.</p>
<p>22) If a man heard that his wife committed adultery, even though he is not certain about it, he must consult an <italic>halachic</italic> authority if he is permitted to live with her.</p>
<p>23) It is not befitting for a respectable man to marry a woman who was divorced because of immodesty.</p>
<p>24) If a woman has bad character traits such as a quarrelsome disposition, or she is not modest as are respectable Jewish women, it is a mitzvah to divorce her, even if it is the first marriage.</p>
<p>25) The Sages have ordained that a man should marry off his sons and daughters when they reach maturity, for if he neglects to do so they may be tempted into prostitution, or to have lewd thoughts. Concerning this it says, &#x201C;And you shall visit your habitation and you will not sin.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn864">14</xref></sup> Also the Sages commanded the <italic>Bnei Yisrael</italic>, that whoever sees that his wife is not conducting herself properly, and is somewhat intimate with other men, he should admonish her and caution her, privately, gently, and in a pure way, to prevent her from stumbling, and to influence her to conduct herself properly. But he should not say to her expressly, &#x201C;Do not meet in private with so and so.&#x201D; (You should not say this) even privately, (since presently we do not have <italic>Mei sotah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn865">15</xref></sup> this can lead to serious problems). If you are not strict with your wife and your children, and all the members of your household to caution them and to constantly supervise their conduct until you are confident they are perfectly free of sin and iniquity, you are considered a sinner. For it is said, &#x201C;And you shall know that peace is in your tent and you shall visit your habitation and not sin.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn866">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>26) It is forbidden to perform the marriage ceremonies of two brothers or of two sisters in the same day, because you may not join one festive event with another. Some [authorities] say that you may not perform both ceremonies even in the same week,<sup><xref rid="fn867">17</xref></sup> and they bring proof [of this from the marriage] of our father, Yaakov. For it is written, &#x201C;Fulfill the week of this one.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn868">18</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn851">1. <italic>Magid Mishnah</italic> rules that it means eighteen complete years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn852">2. Most <italic>poskim</italic> consider this a binding <italic>halachah</italic> but <italic>Be&#x2019;er Hetev</italic> 1:27&#x2014;considers this as just good advice.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn853">3. The <italic>Chavos Yair</italic> Responsa 70 rules that this <italic>halachah</italic> does not apply to a man who is ignorant in Torah knowledge but only to one who also fosters an extraordinary contempt for Torah scholars.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn854">4. From the will of <italic>Rabeinu Yehudah Hachassid</italic>. When the situation arises, most authorities agree that it is sufficient to change the name of one of them by adding another name. Some prefer to change the names of both women.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn855">5. <italic>Chalitzah</italic> means removing. Here it refers to a ritual that includes removing the sandal of her brother-in-law, in reference to the Law of Levirate. (<italic>Yevomah</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn856">6. <italic>Maseches Baba Metziah</italic> (59a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn857">7. Marriage contract.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn858">8. A <italic>chalalah</italic> is a woman who was born of a marriage between a <italic>kohein</italic> and a woman whom he was not permitted to marry, such as a divorc&#x00E9;e etc. (see below)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn859">9. This is a Rabbinic injunction designed to eleminate any chance of someone marrying his sister.

<title>Chapter 146 The Fast of the Bridegroom and Bride</title>
<p>1) It is customary that the bridegroom and the bride fast on their wedding day because on that day their sins are forgiven. They should say <italic>Aneinu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn869">1</xref></sup> at <italic>Minchah</italic> as on other fast days. In our area it is customary that they fast only until after the marriage ceremony.<sup><xref rid="fn870">2</xref></sup> If the ceremony is delayed till the night, then, after the stars appear, they may eat something, provided they do not drink any intoxicating beverages.</p>
<p>2) On <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>, on the day after <italic>Shavuos</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn871">3</xref></sup> on the fifteenth day of the month of <italic>Av</italic>, on the fifteenth day of the month of <italic>Shevat</italic>, and also on <italic>Chanukah</italic> and on <italic>Shushan Purim</italic>, they do not fast. But in the month of <italic>Nissan</italic>, even on <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> <italic>(Nissan)</italic> they do fast. And so too on the thirty-third day of the <italic>Omer</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn872">4</xref></sup> and on the days between <italic>Rosh Chodesh Sivan</italic> and <italic>Shavuos</italic>, and on the days between <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> and <italic>Sukkos</italic>, they fast.<sup><xref rid="fn873">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) On the days they do not fast, they must be careful not to indulge in excessive food and drink; and certainly they must be very careful to abstain from intoxicating beverages. (For some authorities say the very reason for the fast is because we are concerned they may become intoxicated and their minds would not be lucid).</p>
<p>4) The bridegroom and the bride must conduct themselves with utmost sanctity when they enter the <italic>chupah</italic>, and they should repent on that day. They should search [review] their deeds from the day of their birth until this day, and they should confess [their sins,] and seek forgiveness, pardon, and atonement from Hashem, Blessed is He. They should confess and forsake (their evil ways). Their absolute remorse should emanate from a contrite heart. They should firmly resolve from this day onward to serve Hashem honestly and sincerely, and to be holy and pure. They should then enter the <italic>chupah</italic> and pray that the Holy one, Blessed is He, rest His Divine Presence between them, as our Sages of blessed memory said, &#x201C;A husband and wife, (if deserving), the Divine Presence is between them.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn874">6</xref></sup> It is customary for them to say the confession at the <italic>Minchah</italic> prayer as is done the day before <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn869">1. See Chapter 19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn870">2. It is best that they state before starting the fast, that they are fasting only until the marriage ceremony. (<italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 562:12).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn871">3. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 573:7 rules that there is no difference between the day after <italic>Shavuos</italic> and the day after <italic>Pesach</italic> or <italic>Sukkos</italic>. Also see <italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</italic> 103:14 that this fast does not take place on the day after <italic>Pesach</italic> and <italic>Sukkos</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn873">5. <italic>Rama</italic> 573:1. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> cites those <italic>poskim</italic> who are lenient and who rule that they need not fast on any day <italic>Tachnun</italic> is not said.</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 147 The Nuptial Ceremony</title>
<p>1) It is customary to have the <italic>chupah</italic> under the open sky as a good omen (as it is written),<sup><xref rid="fn875">1</xref></sup> &#x201C;So will your children be, like the stars of the heavens.&#x201D; Similarly it is customary to marry only in the phase of the full moon as a good omen.</p>
<p>2) It is proper not to marry until the bride purifies herself. It is now the custom not to be exacting about this. However, it is best to inform the bridegroom before the <italic>chupah</italic>, that she is a <italic>niddah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn876">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) It is the custom in our areas that at the marriage of a virgin, the distinguished persons of the community spread a veil over the bride&#x2019;s head, and bless her, saying, &#x201C;Our sister, be the mother of thousands and myriads.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn877">3</xref></sup> We refer to the <italic>chupah</italic> as the next sequence when a cloth is spread upon poles, under which the groom and bride enter in public, and where he consecrates her to himself. This is where the <italic>berachos</italic> of betrothal and marriage are recited. However, the most essential part of the <italic>chupah</italic> is the intimate privacy, which will be explained, God willing, in the following chapter.</p>
<p>4) The groomsmen [or the father] enrobe the bridegroom with a <italic>kittle</italic><sup><xref rid="fn878">4</xref></sup>, so that he is reminded of the day of death, and be inspired to repent. It is also customary<sup><xref rid="fn879">5</xref></sup> to place ashes on the groom&#x2019;s head on the place where the <italic>tefillin shel rosh</italic> is worn. It is also customary that the parents and prominent relatives bless the groom and the bride and pray that their union be successful.</p>
<p>5) Thereafter the groom is led under the <italic>chupah</italic> (canopy) (for we spread a cloth upon poles which is what we refer to as <italic>chupah</italic>), and we place him [under the <italic>chupah</italic>] facing East, while the <italic>chazan</italic> chants whatever chant is customary in that community. Then the bridesmaids lead the bride (to the <italic>chupah</italic>). The groomsmen and prominent men walk toward the bride, and as they approach her, they turn around and proceed to the <italic>chupah</italic>. Then the bridesmaids bring the bride [under the <italic>chupah</italic>], and together with her, walk around the groom seven times. The <italic>chazan</italic> again chants in accordance with the custom. After that, they place the bride to the right of the groom, and the one who recites the <italic>berachos</italic> stands to the side and faces the East.</p>

</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Chapter 148 The Privacy Following the Marriage Ceremony</title>
<p>1) The most essential part of the <italic>chupah</italic> is bringing the groom and the bride to a designated private room,<sup><xref rid="fn880">1</xref></sup> where they eat together in privacy following the <italic>kidushin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn881">2</xref></sup>. You must prevent anybody from entering that room so that there may be absolute privacy. This is the real <italic>chupah</italic> that consummates and completes the marriage.<sup><xref rid="fn882">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) In the case of a virgin, this <italic>yichud</italic> (privacy) consummates the marriage even if it is not fit for cohabitation, if for example, she is a <italic>niddah</italic>, or if people are going in and out of the room. (When she is a <italic>niddah</italic> it is mandatory that people should be going in and out of the room for if not, they are forbidden to have privacy prior to their first cohabitation.)</p>
<p>3) In the case of a widow the marriage is consummated only when their privacy is appropriate for cohabitation, which means she must be menstrually clean, and no one is able to enter the room.</p>
<p>4) An acquisition may not be made on Shabbos, and therefore if the wedding took place on Friday, great care must be taken that the <italic>yichud</italic> consummating the marriage be made before Shabbos sets in. And then, when the <italic>yichud</italic> consummating the marriage was made while it was yet day, he is permitted to have the initial marital relations on Shabbos, regardless if she is a virgin or a widow. But if the <italic>yichud</italic> was not made while it was yet day (before Shabbos), then he is forbidden to approach her on Shabbos, for their initial marital relations. This is because cohabitation completes the acquisition, and it is forbidden to make an acquisition on Shabbos.</p>

<title>Chapter 149 The Laws of Birkas Hamazon for Weddings and the Mitzvah to Gladden the Bride and Groom</title>
<p>1) Before saying <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, in the company of ten adult males, the leader says <italic>Dvai Hoser</italic> etc. (banish sorrow etc.), and <italic>Shehasimcha bimono</italic> (In Whose abode is joy). <italic>Sheachalnu mishelo</italic> (We have eaten of His bounty) is said without the letter <italic>vav</italic> as a conjunction, and not <italic>vesheachalnu mishelo</italic>. After concluding the <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> the leader takes a second cup (of wine) over which he recites six <italic>berachos</italic>. After this, he says over the (first cup), which is the cup of <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, the berachah <italic>Borei peri Hagaffen</italic> (Creator of the fruit of the vine). It is best not to fill the cup for the six <italic>berachos</italic> until the conclusion of <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>. Care should be taken that men and women should not eat [together] in one room, for if men and women eat [together] in one room <italic>Shehasimcha Bimono</italic> cannot be said, because there is no joy [in the Heavens] where the evil inclination reigns.</p>
<p>2) If a young man [one who was never married] married a virgin or a widow, or if a widower married a virgin, the above mentioned <italic>berachos</italic> are said after the first meal following the wedding, even if they did not eat it on that day, but only at night following the day of the wedding, or even on the following day (because the first meal is considered as if new guests are participating). But after this first meal, and during the entire seven days of the wedding week, only if new guests come to participate is <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> recited in this manner.</p>
<p>3) When a new guest does not come to participate, and the men dining with the groom are not members of his family, but come to celebrate as friends, <italic>Dvai Hoser</italic> is not said, but <italic>nodeh leshimecha</italic> is said as well as <italic>shehasimcha bimono</italic>. After concluding <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, the leader takes a second cup, and recites the berachah <italic>asher bara sassone vesimcha</italic> etc. After that he again takes the cup that was used for <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, and recites over it <italic>Borei peri Haggafen</italic>. For this ten men are not necessary, and even the presence of three is sufficient for saying <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> in this manner. However, if the groom eats only with family members, these things are not said.</p>
<p>4) When a widower marries a widow, if they ate the first meal on the day of the wedding, even if the meal lasted into the night, <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> is recited as stated in paragraph 1. But if they did not begin the meal until nightfall, if there are men dining [with them] to celebrate as friends, <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> should be recited as stated in paragraph 3. (This is true even if there is a new guest participating.) This applies to all the meals during the first three days (after the wedding).</p>
<p>5) The term &#x201C;new guest&#x201D; applies to a person who has come to celebrate as a friend, and for whom they want to prepare extra food even though he does not eat (with them). Shabbos, the first day Yom Tov and the second day Yom Tov are considered as new guests. But this applies only to the meal at night and the meal in the morning, but the third meal is not considered as a new guest unless the groom expounds on a Torah topic.</p>
<p>6) If one invites the groom and the bride to dine with him, and he assigns a private room for them where they can be alone and rejice together, it is considered as [a part of] their wedding and the seven <italic>berachos</italic> are recited. But if this is not the case, even the beracha <italic>asher bara</italic> is not recited, (nor do we say) <italic>shehasimcha bimono</italic>.</p>
<p>7) When the wedding guests break up into many groups [to feast], even in houses that do not face the place of the groom. Nevertheless, each group recites these (seven) <italic>berachos</italic>, since they are eating from the feast that was prepared for the wedding. However, the waiters, who eat after the wedding feast is over, do not recite these <italic>berachos</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn883">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>8) When one remarries his divorced wife, <italic>shehasimcha bimono</italic> is omitted. At the first meal on the wedding day the seven <italic>berachos</italic> are recited.<sup><xref rid="fn884">2</xref></sup> But from then on none of the <italic>berachos</italic> are said.<sup><xref rid="fn885">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>9) It is a mitzvah to rejoice the groom and bride, and to dance before her and say that she is beautiful and gracious, (from the expression, &#x201C;She found grace and favour before him&#x201D;);<sup><xref rid="fn886">4</xref></sup> and we find that Rabbi Yehuda Bar Illai used to dance before the bride.<sup><xref rid="fn887">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>10) It is forbidden to stare at the bride, but you are allowed to look at her jewelry, and at her uncovered hair.</p>
<p>11) Some people have a custom that if the bride was menstrually unclean at the time of the wedding, then afterwards, on the night of her ritual immersion, they make a feast and invite guests. This is improper, and this custom should be abolished because it is a breach of modesty. But if they make a small feast for the household and they say <italic>shehasimcha bimono</italic>, one need not protest. But the seven <italic>berachos</italic> must not be said, other than in the manner described above.<sup><xref rid="fn888">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>12) One who marries a virgin must rejoice with her for seven days, which are called &#x201C;The seven days of feasting.&#x201D; (During this time) he should not do work, and should not do business in the marketplace; but should eat and drink and rejoice with her regardless if he was a bachelor or a widower. Even if she waives this right he is still forbidden to do work. He is forbidden to go alone in the street. If one marries a previously married woman, if he is a widower, all authorities agree he need not rejoice more than three days. If he was never married, some authorities rule that he must rejoice with her seven days since because of him they recite the seven <italic>berachas</italic>. Nevertheless, in this case the woman may waive her right to be rejoiced.<sup><xref rid="fn889">7</xref></sup> If a public fast occurs during &#x201C;The seven days of feasting&#x201D; see chapter 121:7 and chapter 141:2.</p>
<p>13) One who takes a wife to himself must remain in his city a full year to rejoice with her; as it is said, &#x201C;He shall not go out with the army; he shall be free for his home one year, and he shall cheer his wife.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn890">8</xref></sup> But the woman can waive this right.</p>
<ftnote id="fn883">1. <italic>Taz</italic> (<italic>Even Ha&#x2019;ezer</italic> 62:9). But the <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> rules that they should recite the <italic>berachos</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn884">2. <italic>Radvaz</italic>. <italic>Mishpat Shalom</italic> in the name of <italic>Rav Hai Gaon</italic> rules that even under their <italic>chupah</italic> the seven <italic>berachos</italic> are not recited.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 150 Laws of Modesty</title>
<p>1) It is fitting that man conduct himself with great holiness, pure thoughts, and a correct attitude when having marital relationship. He should not indulge in frivolity with his wife, nor defile his mouth with indecent jests, even in private conversation with her, for the Scriptures say, &#x201C;And declare to man what is his conversation.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn891">1</xref></sup> And our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said, &#x201C;Even the light conversation between a man and his wife are recalled to him on the day of Judgement.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn892">2</xref></sup> He should not converse with her during the marital act, nor immediately before it, except what is necessary for marital relations. When she is angry and he is forbidden to have marital relations with her, he may speak kind words to her to appease her. The marital act should be in the most possible modest manner. He underneath and she above him, is considered an impudent manner. Both at the same level, is an act of perversion. It is said of Rabbi Eliezer, that the marital act was done with such awe and terror, that it appeared as if a demon was forcing him to do it.<sup><xref rid="fn893">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) While engaged in the marital act, you should think about Torah subjects or other sacred subjects. Even though [during the act itself] it is forbidden to speak words of Torah, thinking about them is permitted and meritorious, for thought is not likened to speech in this case. Even though in filthy alleys it is forbidden to even think about sacred subjects, this is because of the Divine command, &#x201C;And your camp shall be holy;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn894">4</xref></sup> but where it is forbidden because of body nakedness, concerning which it is written, <italic>ervas davar</italic> (unseemingly thing), our Sages of blessed memory inferred from this that speaking <italic>davar</italic> (words of Torah) is forbidden, but thinking about them is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn895">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) The marital act is forbidden in a lighted room, even if the light is dimmed with a garment. But if you make a partition ten <italic>tefachim</italic> high<sup><xref rid="fn896">6</xref></sup> in front of the light, it is permissible. Marital relations are also forbidden by day unless the room is darkened. At night, if the moon is shining directly on you it is forbidden. However if it is not shining [directly] on you, even though it is shining into the room, you may shut out its light with a garment [or window shade], and it is then permitted. Also, if there is a light in another room and it shines into this room, you must shut out this light with a garment.</p>
<p>4) Marital relations are forbidden in the presence of any person who is awake,<sup><xref rid="fn897">7</xref></sup> even with a partition of ten <italic>tefachim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn898">8</xref></sup> In the presence of a child who is unable to speak, it is permitted.</p>
<p>5) It is forbidden to look at the genitals of your wife. Anyone who does look there, is devoid of shame. He violates [the Scriptural verse], &#x201C;And walk humbly (or modestly) before Adonoy,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn899">9</xref></sup> and removes the sign of shame from his face. A bashful person is not apt to sin, as it is written, &#x201C;So that His fear be on your face,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn900">10</xref></sup> which refers to bashfulness, &#x201C;So that you do not sin.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn900">10</xref></sup> Also, (by looking there); you stimulate evil desire within yourself. Certainly one who kisses that place violates all these admonitions, and in addition he violates [the Scriptural verse,] &#x201C;Do not make yourselves repulsive.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn901">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) In a room in which there is a <italic>seifer Torah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn902">12</xref></sup> marital relations are forbidden until it is removed to another room. If there is no other room you must make a partition in front of it that is ten <italic>tefachim</italic> high. The partition should be totally closed up, so that the <italic>seifer Torah</italic> cannot be seen. The curtain around the bed is not considered a partition since it is movable; unless it is tied at the bottom. <italic>Tefillin, Chumashim</italic>, or other sacred writings, such as the Talmud, Midrash and their commentaries, whether they are written or printed<sup><xref rid="fn903">13</xref></sup> should be placed into a vessel within a vessel.<sup><xref rid="fn904">14</xref></sup> This is valid only when the second vessel [or covering] is not especially made for such holy works, but if they are especially made for them, even ten such vessels are all considered as only one vessel. If you spread a cover over the chest containing these books, it is considered like a vessel within a vessel. Also a <italic>mezuzah</italic>, when affixed on the inside of the room, must be covered it with two covers, so it should be a vessel within a vessel. The Name (<italic>Shaddai</italic>, on the outer face of the <italic>mezuzah</italic>) must also be covered. A glass covering is of no avail for the covering must not be transparent.<sup><xref rid="fn905">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>7) You must not be excessive in marital relations with your wife, except at the time you are required to fulfil her conjugal rights, as it is written, &#x201C;And he shall not diminish her conjugal rights.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn906">16</xref></sup> Men who are healthy, who enjoy the pleasures of life, who have profitable businesses in their home town, and are not burdened with taxes, should perform their marital duty nightly. Laborers who work in the city in which they reside, should perform their marital duty twice a week. If they are employed in another city, their marital duty is once a week. Also the merchants who travel to the villages with their mules to buy grain to be sold in town, and those who have similar pursuits, their marital duty is once a week. Men who carry freight on camels to distant places, their marital duty is once in thirty days. The marital duty of Torah scholars is from Shabbos eve to Shabbos eve. You must perform your marital duty even when your wife is pregnant or nursing. You may not deprive her of her conjugal rights unless she consents to it willingly, and only after you have already fulfilled the Divine commandment of propogation. If you deprive her conjugal rights in order to afflict her, you violate a negative command, as it is said, &#x201C;And he shall not diminish her conjugal rights.&#x201D;</p>
<p>8) Every husband is required to be with his wife on the night of her ritual immersion, and on the night before he sets out on a journey, unless he is going to perform a mitzvah. When a husband sees that his wife is enticing him, trying to please him, and beautifying herself in front of him, in order to attract his intention, he is obligated to be with her even if it is not the appointed time; and from such a union will come worthy children. However, if she demands it openly, she is a brazen woman, and she is considered like a harlot; and he is forbidden to keep her for a wife.</p>
<p>9) When engaging in marital relations, your intention should not be to satisfy your personal pleasure but as one fulfilling his obligation to satisfy her conjugal rights; and also to fulfill the command of your Creator, (and) to have children who engage in Torah study, and fulfill the <italic>mitzvos</italic> of the Jewish people. It is also proper if your intent is to improve the fetus; as our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said, &#x201C;During the first trimester of pregnancy cohabitation is difficult for the woman and the child. During the middle trimester, it is difficult for the woman but good for the child. During the last trimester, it is good both for the woman and the child, for it will cause the child at his birth to be strong and healthy.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn907">17</xref></sup> This too is a proper intention. If your purpose of being with her is to restrain yourself against sinful lust, when you are overwhelmed by desire, and have a craving for it&#x2014;if this is your intention, you will also be rewarded. However, it is better that you push off your desire and overcome it; for (as the Sages said), &#x201C;A man has a small organ, if he starves it, it is contented, and if he pampers it, it is hungry.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn908">18</xref></sup> But one who has no need for it, but deliberately arouses his desire in order to satisfy that desire, is following the counsel of the evil impulse.</p>
<p>10) If possible you should be careful not to have marital relations in the beginning or at the end of the night, but rather in the middle of the night. [If you were asleep before this] you may not touch the penile orifice<sup><xref rid="fn909">19</xref></sup> even for the sake of cohabitation, before washing your hands properly, that is, three times alternately, as stated in Chapter 2.</p>
<p>11) Marital relations are forbidden in the market places, in streets, in gardens, or in orchards. It is permitted only in dwellings so that it does not resemble prostitution.</p>
<p>12) If, God forbid, there is [such] famine in the land that the price of grain [food] doubled,<sup><xref rid="fn910">20</xref></sup> even though you have sufficient grain [food] in your house, or if, God forbid, there is some other calamity [in the country],<sup><xref rid="fn911">21</xref></sup> marital relations are forbidden except on the night of her ritual immersion. Those who are childless<sup><xref rid="fn912">22</xref></sup> are permitted to have marital relations on each appointed time of marital duty.</p>
<p>13) You should not have marital relations with your wife unless she is willing. But if she is not willing you should not have marital relations with her, and it is certainly forbidden to force her. Also, you should not have marital relations with her if you hate her,<sup><xref rid="fn913">23</xref></sup> or if she hates you and tells you she does not want you, although she consents to marital relations. Also, if you have decided to divorce her, and she is unaware of it; even though you do not hate her, you are forbidden to have marital relations with her. You should also not have marital relations with your wife when she is actually asleep. You also may not have marital relations when either of you are intoxicated.</p>
<p>14) House guests are forbidden to have marital relations. But if you and your wife were given private quarters, it is permitted, provided you do not sleep on sheets that belong to the host.</p>
<p>15) According to the rules of good health, you should not have marital relations when you are satiated, and not when you are hungry, but only when your food has been digested. You should not have marital relations while standing, and not in a sitting position, not on a day you had a bath,<sup><xref rid="fn914">24</xref></sup> and not on a day you let blood; not on the day you set out on a journey, or return from a journey<sup><xref rid="fn915">25</xref></sup> by foot; and not on the day before nor on the day following any of the above.</p>
<p>16) You should not have marital relations on a bed where an infant lies at your feet if the baby is less than one year old. After leaving the bathroom, you should wait an hour before having marital relations.<sup><xref rid="fn916">26</xref></sup> A nursing woman should not indulge in marital relations unless the baby is asleep. After marital relations she should not nurse him before two thirds of an hour transpires,<sup><xref rid="fn917">27</xref></sup> unless the baby is crying.<sup><xref rid="fn918">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>17) Semen is the vitality of man&#x2019;s body and the light of his eyes, and when issued in excess, the body weakens and life is shortened. Anyone who overindulges in marital relations, ages prematurely, his strength ebbs, his eyes dim, his breath becomes foul; the hair on his head, his eyebrows, and his eye lashes fall out. The hair of his beard and armpits, the hair on his legs, increase, his teeth fall out and many other aches besides these befall him. Great physicians said one out of a thousand dies from other diseases, the rest of the thousand (999) die from sexual indulgence. Therefore, man should avoid such indulgence.</p>

<title>Chapter 151 The Prohibition of Discharging Semen in Vain And the Ways of Ammendment for One Who has Succumbed to this Sin</title>
<p>1) It is forbidden to discharge semen in vain. This is a graver sin than any other in the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn919">1</xref></sup> Those who masturbate and thus discharge semen in vain, not only do they commit a grave sin, but also one who does this is placed under a ban. Concerning such people it is said, &#x201C;Your hands are full of blood,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn920">2</xref></sup> and it is likened to killing a person. See what <italic>Rashi</italic> wrote in the <italic>Sidrah</italic> of <italic>Vayeishev</italic><sup><xref rid="fn921">3</xref></sup> concerning Er and Onan, who died because of committing this sin. Occasionally, as a punishment for this sin, God forbid, one&#x2019;s children die when young,<sup><xref rid="fn922">4</xref></sup> or grow up to be wicked, while the sinner is reduced to poverty.</p>
<p>2) It is forbidden to bring on an erection (in vain), or to cause yourself to think about women. If a [lewd] thought comes spontaneously, you should divert your attention from nonsense to words of Torah, which is likened to, &#x201C;A lovely hind and a graceful doe.&#x201D; Lewd thoughts prevail only in a heart devoid of (Torah) wisdom. You should be extremely careful to avoid an erection. Therefore, it is forbidden to sleep on your back facing upward, or to sleep (on your stomach) facing downward, but you should sleep on your side to avoid an erection. Two bachelors should not sleep in one bed. You should not watch animals, beasts, or fowl when the male and female copulate. It is forbidden to ride on an animal without a saddle.</p>
<p>3) When urinating, it is forbidden to hold the penis<sup><xref rid="fn923">5</xref></sup> even to facilitate urination. If you are married and your wife is also with you in town, and she is clean (menstrually), from the <italic>halachic</italic> standpoint it is permitted; for when a person has the possibility, he will usually not succumb to lustful thoughts and stimulation. But it is a matter of piety to be stringent even in this situation.<sup><xref rid="fn924">6</xref></sup> When not for the purpose of urinating, even <italic>halachically</italic> the above mentioned things are forbidden.</p>
<p>4) At supper you should not eat or drink excessively nor eat any foods that tend to heat the body, such as fat meats, all milk products, cheese, eggs, and garlic. Neither should you drink a beverage that tends to heat the body, for these things cause the committing of this sin.</p>
<p>5) If, God forbid, you had a seminal emission at night, upon waking up from your sleep you should wash your hands and say with a contrite heart, &#x201C;Master of the Universe I have done this unwittingly but it was due to sinful thoughts and sinful reflections; therefore, may it be Your will Adonoy, my God, and the God of my fathers, to erase this iniquity through your great mercy, and save me from sinful thoughts, and from similar occurrences forever and ever. <italic>Amein</italic>, so may it be Your will.&#x201D;</p>
<p>6) If you wish to avoid this sin, guard your mouth against obscene language, lies, talebearing, slander, and mockery. You should also guard your ears from hearing such talk. You must also be careful to fulfill your vows, not to worry too much about things, and be careful to guard yourself against lewd thoughts. Before going to sleep you should study Torah or say the first four Chapters of the Psalms,<sup><xref rid="fn925">7</xref></sup> and be careful not to sleep alone in a room.</p>
<p>7) Means of amendment for a person who has succumbed to this sin, are recorded in the book, <italic>Yesod Yosef</italic>, which the author culled and gathered from holy and ancient books. Here I will cite some of them briefly: He should try to be <italic>sandeik</italic>, that is, to have babies circumcised on his knees (lap), and in particular to be a <italic>sandeik</italic> for poor families. He should increase his charity to the poor, observe Shabbos properly and honor it delightfully, and light many Shabbos candles. He should honor and love those who learn Torah. He should pray with fervor and tears. He should adopt the character of humility, and if he hears people insult him, he should be quiet and forgiving. When performing a mitzvah, he should do it energetically and with quickness until it warms him, particularly when preparing the <italic>matzos</italic> for Pesach. He should raise his children to study Torah, and train them to be God-fearing. He should raise an orphan in his home, and should treat him as he treats his own son. He should engage in the mitzvah of dowering poor brides. He should be called up to the reading of the Torah at least once a month, and recite the <italic>berachos</italic> aloud. He should look in the Torah, and read quietly along with the reader. He should try to be among the first ten to come to the Synagogue. He should arise in the middle of the night to recite <italic>tikun chatzos</italic><sup><xref rid="fn926">8</xref></sup> with tears. And if it is impossible for him to get up in the middle of the night, he should recite <italic>tikun chatzos</italic> later in the night. He should love peace and should pursue peace.<sup><xref rid="fn927">9</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn919">1. <italic>Zohar, Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha&#x2019;Ezer</italic> 23:1. <italic>Beis Shmuel</italic> explains this is not meant to be taken literally. Any sin that carries a penalty of death or <italic>koreis</italic> is a graver sin. This is meant to impress man with the severity of this sin.</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 152 Prohibition Against Being Secluded with Women and Other Forbidden Associations with Them.</title>
<p>1) It is forbidden to be secluded with any woman whether young or old, a Jewess or a non-Jewess,<sup><xref rid="fn928">1</xref></sup> whether she is a relative or not a relative, with the exception of a father who may be alone with his daughter;<sup><xref rid="fn929">2</xref></sup> and a mother with her son,<sup><xref rid="fn930">3</xref></sup> and a husband with his wife, even though she is menstrually unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn931">4</xref></sup> (Concerning a bride who is menstrually unclean see Chapter 157, below).</p>
<p>2) If your wife is [also] present, you are permitted to be alone even with another woman because your wife is a chaperon. But a Jewess may not be alone with a non-Jew, even in the presence of his wife. Even if there are many non-Jews accompanied by their wives, she may not be alone with them.</p>
<p>3) One woman may be alone with two virtuous men, but only in town, and in the daytime. But in a field, or at night even in the city, there must be [at least] three virtuous men present. With immoral men, she should never be alone, even if they are many, unless their wives are with them. One man is forbidden to be secluded with two women. Some authorities permit seclusion with three or more women, provided his vocation or trade is not specifically for women. Other authorities forbid it in any event.</p>
<p>4) If a woman&#x2019;s husband is in town, you need not be concerned about being secluded with her, because she is in fear of her husband.</p>
<p>5) In a room where the door is open<sup><xref rid="fn932">5</xref></sup> to a public thoroughfare,<sup><xref rid="fn933">6</xref></sup> there is no prohibition of <italic>yichud</italic> during the daytime and in the early evening, so long as people are passing by on the street. But if he is an intimate friend of hers, like one with whom she grew up, or if she is related to him, or if her husband warned her not to be alone with him, she may not be alone with him, even if her husband is in town, and not even in a room whose door is opened to a public thoroughfare.</p>
<p>6) If a girl is less than three years old, it is permitted to be secluded with her. Likewise, if a boy is less than nine years old a woman is permitted to be alone with him.</p>
<p>7) A man who does not have a wife should not teach children, because their mothers come to the school and at times he will be alone with a woman. [If he is married], it is not necessary that his wife be with him at the school, so long as she is in town; even if she is at home, and he teaches at the school. But a woman should not teach children even if her husband is in town, unless her husband lives with her in the house (where she teaches), because the fathers bring their children to school.</p>
<p>8) A man must diligently avoid women. It is forbidden to make gestures with your hands or with your feet, nor wink your eyes at a woman. It is forbidden to jest with her, to act with levity in her presence, or to gaze at her beauty. It is forbidden to smell perfumes designed specifically for a woman; especially when she is holding them in her hands, or when they are on her. It is forbidden to look at the colored garments of a woman with whom you are acquainted, although the garments are not upon her lest you come to think about her. If you encounter a woman on the street, it is forbidden to walk behind her, but you should hasten your steps so that she is alongside you or behind you. You should not pass by the door of a harlot, even at a distance of four cubits. He who gazes, even at the small finger of a woman in order to enjoy its sight<sup><xref rid="fn934">7</xref></sup>, commits a very grave sin.<sup><xref rid="fn935">8</xref></sup> It is forbidden to listen to the voice [of a woman] singing<sup><xref rid="fn936">9</xref></sup> or to gaze at a woman&#x2019;s hair.<sup><xref rid="fn937">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>9) You must refrain from showing interest in women. It is forbidden to send her regards even through her husband. Therefore, when writing a letter to your friend, it is forbidden to write, &#x201C;Send regards to your wife.&#x201D; But it is permitted to inquire of her husband or of someone else about her welfare. It is also permitted to write to your friend, &#x201C;Let me know how your wife is doing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>10) If you hug or kiss even one of your female relatives, even though you derive no pleasure from it, you are violating a prohibition, for you may not have any physical closeness with a near relative, with the exception of a father with his daughter, and a mother with her son, who are permitted to hug and kiss.</p>
<p>11) You must not engage in any intimate activities, even with your wife in the presence of others, so that on-lookers will not be led to sinful thoughts.</p>
<p>12) A man must not dwell in his father-in-law&#x2019;s house, unless he has a private bedroom.</p>
<p>13) The great men of Yisrael, of blessed memory, in their holy works, admonished against the evil custom prevailing in some communities, where there are no Torah scholars or God-fearing men, that the groom and bride become intimate with hugs and kisses; and they also allow dances, in which boys and girls dance together. All virgins are assumed to be menstrually unclean, and since the prohibition of <italic>niddah</italic> applies to married and single woman alike, whoever touches a woman in an intimate manner deserves punishment by lashing. Besides the grave sin of touching a <italic>niddah</italic>, he also stirs the evil impulse within himself, and causes himself to have an erection, and to discharge semen in vain, God forbid. Certainly anyone who is able to effectively protest [against this custom] must make every endeavor to protest. At least, it is the duty of every man who has the fear of God in his heart, to control his household, and to supervise the members of his family, so that they will keep themselves distant from this extremely abominable behavior. Anyone who is able to effectively protest and does not protest, God forbid, he too will be accountable for this very iniquity. Anyone who saves others from sin has saved himself (too), and it shall be well with him.</p>
<p>14) With regard to the woman whom you wish to marry, it is permissible and even desirable for you to look at her to see if she pleases you, but you may not gaze upon her in a lustful manner. Concerning this it is said, &#x201C;I made a covenant with my eyes, how then can I ever gaze at a maiden.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn938">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>15) If you divorced the wife you married, she may not reside in the same courtyard as you do. If you are a <italic>kohein</italic>, or even a <italic>Yisroeil</italic>, but she has since married another man, and was divorced from him too; or if you divorced her because she was forbidden to you; all of these require a greater measure of separation. And subsequently, she may not reside with you in the same alley if it comes to a dead-end. But if it is an open alley, through which there is traffic, they are permitted to live there. A divorced woman who remarried and lives with her second husband, they [she and her first husband] require an even greater measure of separation, and she may not dwell with her first husband in the same neighborhood. In all these cases of separation, the woman must move away from him. But if the courtyard belongs to her, he must move away from her.</p>
<p>16) A man is permitted to support his divorcee, and it is [even] a mitzvah to do so more than to another poor person, for it is said, &#x201C;Do not hide from your own flesh.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn939">12</xref></sup> But he may have no personal contact with her, and should send her support through an agent.</p>
<p>17) Said Rav Beruna in the name of Rav, &#x201C;He who sleeps in a room in which a husband and wife reside, the Scripture says concerning him, &#x201C;The women of My people you cast out of their pleasant houses&#x201D;,<sup><xref rid="fn940">13</xref></sup> (for they are ashamed to be intimate because of him). Rav Yosef said this applies even if his wife is menstrually unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn941">14</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn928">1. <italic>Tur</italic> rules that <italic>yichud</italic> with a Jewish relative with whom relations would be considered incest is a Scriptural prohibition. According to <italic>Rambam</italic> it is <italic>Divrei Kabalah</italic>, and the penalty is flogging in the same manner as for violation of Rabbinic ordinances. <italic>Yichud</italic> with an unmarried girl is prohibited by decree of King David and his court. However, once they have menstruated, they are always in a state of <italic>niddah</italic> (for unmarried girls are not accustomed to purify themselves from menstrual uncleanliness. See <italic>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</italic> 159&#x2013;162), and therefore <italic>yichud</italic> with them is prohibited as with relatives. <italic>Yichud</italic> with a non-Jewess is prohibited by decree of <italic>Shamai</italic> and <italic>Hillel</italic> and their courts. See <italic>Shulchan Aruch Even Ha&#x2019;Ezer</italic> 22:1,2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn929">2. Or with his granddaughter, great grand etc. (<italic>Bach</italic>)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 153 The Laws of a Woman Who is Menstrually Unclean</title>
<p>1) A woman from whose womb there issued a drop of blood, be it ever so small, regardless of the circumstances, whether it is in her nature, as some women, to have a regular period or an irregular period; even if she experienced some sort of accident which caused blood to issue from her womb, she is a <italic>niddah</italic> (menstrually unclean), until she counts seven clean days, and properly performs the ritual immersion. Anyone who cohabitates with her when she is menstrually unclean, receives the punishment of <italic>koras</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn942">1</xref></sup> She too receives the punishment, <italic>koras</italic>. For touching in an intimate manner, their punishment is flagellation.<sup><xref rid="fn943">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) Even if she did not feel the issue of blood from her womb, but found a stain of blood on her body, or garment, or sheet, or any other place, and she is unable to attribute its presence to any source other than from her womb, she is unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn944">3</xref></sup> A woman who finds a stain that is not actually red, but is not actually white either,<sup><xref rid="fn945">4</xref></sup> must consult a competent Rav, for concerning this there are many divergent laws regarding the size of the stain. There are also many laws regarding to what it can be attributed and to what it cannot be attributed. There is also a distinction as to the time she found it, whether it was on her menstrually clean days or on the first days of her seven clean days.</p>
<p>3) If a woman senses that her womb has opened [i.e. she senses the beginning of mensruation], even if she examined herself immediately and found nothing, she is menstrually unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn946">5</xref></sup> (It is necessary to let women know this, for many women do not know it.) But if she found a white secretion from her body without any reddish admixture, she is clean.</p>
<p>4) It is written, &#x201C;And to a woman who is menstrually unclean, you shall not approach.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn947">6</xref></sup> Since it is written &#x201C;You shall not approach,&#x201D; it is explained, that any kind of approach is forbidden. You should not jest (with her), and should not indulge in levity with her, or even speak words that may lead to sin.<sup><xref rid="fn948">7</xref></sup> However, you may be secluded with her, for since you have had marital relations with her, and she will be permitted to you after immersion, your impulse will not be that strong, and we are not concerned that you might cohabit with her when it is forbidden.</p>
<p>5) You may not touch your wife (during that period) even on the small finger, and you may not hand her anything,<sup><xref rid="fn949">8</xref></sup> not even a long object, nor may you receive anything from her hand. Also, throwing anything from your hand into her hand or from her hand to yours is forbidden.</p>
<p>6) You may not eat with her at the table<sup><xref rid="fn950">9</xref></sup> unless you make a noticeable change; for example, separating your plate from her plate, with something you do not usually place there at other times, or she should change her place. If you are accustomed, when she is menstrually clean, to eat together from one plate, and now when she is unclean you eat from separate plates, this change is sufficient.<sup><xref rid="fn951">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>7) You are not allowed to drink what she leaves over in her cup. But if someone else drank from the cup after her, or it has been poured into another cup you are permitted to drink it. If she drank from it and you are unaware of it, and you want to drink from that cup, she need not tell you that she drank from it. (But if you know she drank from it but do not know that she is a <italic>niddah</italic>, it would seem that she has to inform you). She is permitted to drink the leftovers from your cup. Some authorities maintain that just as you are forbidden to drink the leftovers from her cup so too you are forbidden<sup><xref rid="fn952">11</xref></sup> to eat from her leftover food.<sup><xref rid="fn953">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>8) You may not sleep together in the same bed, even if the bed is not exclusively hers, and even if you are both fully clothed and do not touch one another, and even if each of you have a separate mattress. And even to lie on two separate beds, if the beds touch one another it is forbidden. If you both lie on the ground, you should not lie facing one another unless there is a sizable distance between you and her. The same applies if you sleep in two separate beds placed parallel to one another, whereby sometimes you face one another. Even though there is space between the beds, it is forbidden unless there is a sizable space between the beds.<sup><xref rid="fn954">13</xref></sup> The husband is forbidden even to sit on the bed<sup><xref rid="fn955">14</xref></sup> reserved for her, even when she is not present. She is forbidden to sleep on the bed reserved for her husband. But so far as her sitting on it, you need not be stringent.</p>
<p>9) It is forbidden to sit together on a long bench, if it sways. If someone else sits<sup><xref rid="fn956">15</xref></sup> between you, it is permitted. You may not ride together in the same wagon or on the same boat, if it is just a pleasure trip, like riding through parks, orchards or similar excursions. But if you are travelling from city to city on business, it is permitted, even though you are by yourselves; provided you are seated in a way that you will not touch one another.</p>
<p>10) You must not look at any part of her body that she usually keeps covered.<sup><xref rid="fn957">16</xref></sup> But on those parts that are usually not covered, you are permitted to look even if you derive pleasure from it. You are forbidden to scent her personal perfume, and you are forbidden to hear her sing.</p>
<p>11) It is proper that she wear special clothes<sup><xref rid="fn958">17</xref></sup> on the days of her impurity, so that they will both always remember that she is menstrually unclean. With great <italic>halachic</italic> difficulty, the Sages permitted her to use cosmetics (rouge, lipstick etc.), and to dress in colorful (attractive) clothing<sup><xref rid="fn959">18</xref></sup> during her days of impurity, so that she will not become repulsive to her husband.</p>
<p>12) She may not pour a cup of wine for you in your presence,<sup><xref rid="fn960">19</xref></sup> nor may she bring it and place it in front of you at the table;<sup><xref rid="fn961">20</xref></sup> nor may she make your bed in your presence. But when not in your presence, all these things are permitted, even though you know that she did them. She is forbidden to pour water<sup><xref rid="fn962">21</xref></sup> to wash your face and hands and feet, even if the water is cold.</p>
<p>13) Just as she is forbidden to pour a cup of wine for you, so are you forbidden to pour wine for her.<sup><xref rid="fn963">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, even to send her a cup of wine specially for her, even if it is a cup over which a berachah has been pronounced, is forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn964">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>14) If you are sick and there is no one but her to attend you, she is permitted to attend you<sup><xref rid="fn965">24</xref></sup> but without direct contact with your body,<sup><xref rid="fn966">25</xref></sup> but rather by means of some object. She may even raise you up, lay you down, and support you. But she must be very careful not to wash your face, hands, and feet, or make your bed in your presence. If the woman is sick (when she is a <italic>niddah</italic>), her husband is forbidden to attend her, even without touching her,<sup><xref rid="fn967">26</xref></sup> except in a case of extreme emergency, when it is impossible to find someone else to attend her. If the husband is a physician, and there is no other physician as competent as himself, he may feel her pulse, since he is not doing it out of desire or love.</p>
<p>15) All the foregoing precautionary measures must also be observed during the &#x201C;white days,&#x201D; that is, the seven days after the flow has ceased, and even thereafter if she delays her immersion. They are forbidden in all that was mentioned previously, until after she immerses herself.</p>
<p>16) During the time a woman is a <italic>niddah</italic>, during her menstruation period before the white days, it is customary<sup><xref rid="fn968">27</xref></sup> for her not to enter a synagogue and not to pray. But on the Days of Awe, that is from the first day of <italic>Selichot</italic> when multitudes assemble at the synagogue, and she will be greatly distressed if she does not go, she is permitted to go and pray. Similarly at the marriage of her son, or daughter, or she has given birth and it is time for her to go to the synagogue, or for similar things, she is permitted to do so.</p>
<ftnote id="fn942">1.

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 154 Regulations Concerning the Menses, Laws of Examination Before and After Marital Relations</title>
<p>1) The date of the menses is established by three consecutive times. That is, if menstruation began three consecutive times, at a similar time, then this date is her established date of the menses. There are women who establish their periodic menses at certain days of the month. For instance, if she perceived the flow three consecutive times, each time on <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> (New Moon), then her established menses is on <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>. Also if she perceived it three consecutive times on the fifth of the Jewish-Hebrew month, then the fifth day of the Jewish-Hebrew month is the established day of her menses. This way of reckoning is referred to as &#x201C;Menses determined by days,&#x201D; for it is consistently the same day in the month. And even though the number of days between one perception and the other is not always alike, for some months consist of only twenty-nine days, while others consist of thirty days, nevertheless, since she is accustomed to perceive on a certain day of the month, this day is her established day of the menses.</p>
<p>2) Most women, however, are accustomed to establish a mensal pattern of &#x201C;equal intervals&#x201D;, which is a separation from one perception to another of an equal number of intervening days. For instance, if she perceives a flow and twenty-five days elapse, or thirty days or thirty-two days or the like, and following she again perceives a flow. If she had these perceptions on three consecutive equal<sup><xref rid="fn969">1</xref></sup> intervals, this is her established date of the menses, and is referred to as the menses of &#x201C;equal intervals.&#x201D; And after another interruption of that number of days, the following day is her established date of the menses. Since the menses cannot be established by less than three times, and an interval cannot be recognized by less than two perceptions; therefore, establishment of the menses of equal intervals requires four perceptions. For instance, if she perceived a flow today, followed by an interval of twenty-five days, and she perceived, followed again by an interval of twenty-five days, and she perceived, followed again by an interval of twenty-five days, and she perceived, she has had four perceptions, between which there were three equal intervals, and has thereby established her menses.</p>
<p>3) There are some women who do not have an established date of perception, neither of the days of the month, nor of equal intervals, but do experience various physical symptoms.<sup><xref rid="fn970">2</xref></sup> For instance, it is charactaristic of her to yawn before menstruation, in the manner of one who stretches his arms from weariness, or like a person who opens his mouth (yawns) from drowsiness, or like a person who burps because of the food he has eaten&#x2014;all of these are included in &#x201C;yawning.&#x201D; Similarly, if she flatuates or sneezes, or feels some pain in the region of the navel or the womb, or she has an attack of chills and fever, or the hair of her body bristles, or her head and (her) limbs grow heavy. If she experienced any of these symptoms, on three consecutive periods, and immediately began menstruation, this symptom serves as her established date of menses. And this is referred to as &#x201C;Menses regulated by physical symptoms.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn971">3</xref></sup> Yawning and sneezing only when repeated many times consecutively are regarded as symptoms by which to establish a date of menses, but if she yawns or sneezes one time, the date of menses is not established for it is a natural and normal thing. The date of menses is established by symptoms only if she perceived each of the three times through one particular symptom. But if once it occurs through one symptom and once through another symptom, it is not considered established.</p>
<p>4) Some women establish their menstrual periods by monthly, or by equal intervals, combined with yawning, sneezing, or similar physical symptoms. For instance, every fifth day of the month she yawns or sneezes, and then perceives the flow, or when twenty-five days from perception elapse, she yawns or sneezes, and then perceives the flow. This is referred to as &#x201C;menses regulated by combining factors.&#x201D; That is, it is a combination of a regular date and a physical symptom. If this pattern occurs three (consecutive) times, then, when that regular day arrives, and she yawns or sneezes, she must be concerned about her perception. But with the arrival of that day alone, or with yawning and sneezing alone, she need not be concerned, since she has regulated her term only with the two factors combined.</p>
<p>5) A woman whose periods are regular, is at all other times presumed to be menstrually clean, and her husband may have marital relations with her, and does not have to inquire about her status. Even if she is partly asleep he may have marital relations with her, and she does not need to examine herself, either before marital relations or afterwards. On the contrary, she should not examine herself in the presence of her husband,<sup><xref rid="fn972">4</xref></sup> so that he will not be apprehensive, thinking she probably felt something, for if she did not feel something she would not have examined herself. Therefore if she examines herself in his presence, before having marital relations, there is cause for concern, that perhaps because of his apprehension he might keep away from her.<sup><xref rid="fn973">5</xref></sup> And if she examines herself in his presence after having marital relations, there is cause for concern that perhaps he will be apprehensive, thinking that she probably felt something while having marital relations, and will keep away from her the next time. Therefore, she should not examine herself in her husband&#x2019;s presence. But if not in her husband&#x2019;s presence, the more a woman examines herself, the more praiseworthy she is.</p>
<p>6) A woman whose periods are totally irregular should examine herself before and after having marital relations. The husband, too, should wipe himself<sup><xref rid="fn974">6</xref></sup> after marital relation&#x2019;s to ascertain whether there is a drop of blood. However, if her flow of blood is assumed to have ceased, for instance, a pregnant woman after the first three months of pregnancy, or one who nurses, or a woman who is old, these need not examine themselves.</p>
<p>7) There are women who do not have a regular cycle, but have, nevertheless, a certain number of days during which they do not perceive any flow. For instance, a woman who has ascertained that during the twenty-five days after her perception of a flow, she does not perceive another flow, but only after that, and then she has no definite date, because sometimes she delays one day, or two or three days. Since it has been established three times, that during these days she does not perceive, a woman until twenty-five days elapse, is regarded during these days like a woman who has a regular menstrual cycle. But on the days that follow when she is uncertain, and cannot be presumed to be menstrually clean, she is forbidden to her husband.</p>
<ftnote id="fn969">1. If this sequence had been interrupted by a flow after a shorter interval elapsed, this does not upset the establishment of the longer interval. For example, if she perceived after twenty days on two consecutive occasions, and then perceived after a fifteen day interval, and then again after a twenty day interval, she has thus established a twenty day cycle. But if, instead of the fifteenth, she had seen on the twenty-fifth, she has not established her menses. <italic>Chazon Ish</italic> 85:34.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn970">2. That are brought on by the oncoming menses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn971">3. During the onset (day or night) when she experiences one of these symptoms, she is forbidden to you. <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 189:19. At that time she must examine herself to see if she is menstrually clean. <italic>Eshkol</italic> 34. If she did not examine herself, she remains forbidden until she does and finds herself menstrually clean. See <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 184:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn972">4. Not necessarily his presence but rather his knowledge.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn973">5. And thus neglect the mitzvah of propagation. (<italic>L&#x2019;vush</italic> 186)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn974">6. <italic>Rambam</italic>, but the <italic>Rosh</italic> maintains this is unnecessary; and this is the accepted custom.</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Chapter 155 Separation Before the Menstrual Term Differences Between Regular and Irregular Menses</title>
<p>1) The Rabbis expounded<sup><xref rid="fn975">1</xref></sup> (on the verse) &#x201C;You shall separate the Children of Yisrael from their impurities.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn976">2</xref></sup> Rabbi Josiah said: &#x201C;This verse is an admonition to the Children of Yisrael, that they must separate from their wives prior to their expected periods.&#x201D; How long before? Rava said,<sup><xref rid="fn977">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;An <italic>onah</italic>.&#x201D; An <italic>onah</italic> is either a day or a night. If she is accustomed to perceive the flow during the day, even though she is accustomed to perceive this flow at the end of the day, she is nevertheless forbidden to her husband from the beginning of the day. Likewise, if she is accustomed to perceive in the morning and has not yet perceived, nevertheless, she is forbidden the entire day until the night.<sup><xref rid="fn978">4</xref></sup> Likewise, if her periods occur at night, even if she is accustomed to perceive the flow in the beginning of the night, or if she is accustomed to perceive the flow at the end of the night, nevertheless she is forbidden to her husband the entire night. According to many authorities,<sup><xref rid="fn979">5</xref></sup> not only marital relations are forbidden at this time, but also every other type of intimacy is forbidden, and it is proper to heed this opinion.<sup><xref rid="fn980">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) Some authorities<sup><xref rid="fn981">7</xref></sup> say that this <italic>onah</italic> during which you must separate (from her), is the <italic>onah</italic> prior to the <italic>onah</italic> during which she expects her period. For instance, if she expects her period at night, she is also forbidden the entire day before. If she expects her period by day, she is also forbidden the entire night before. And this is the proper course to follow.<sup><xref rid="fn982">8</xref></sup> However, if you are setting out on a journey, or you have just returned from one, or if she has performed the ritual immersion<sup><xref rid="fn983">9</xref></sup> on the night preceding her expected period, you should not heed the stricter opinion.</p>
<p>3) If a woman does not have regular menstrual periods, then the thirtieth day<sup><xref rid="fn984">10</xref></sup> after her (last) perception is always considered her fixed period, and is termed &#x201C;an average <italic>onah</italic>.&#x201D; For instance, if she perceived the flow on Monday, of the week when the <italic>sidrah</italic> of <italic>Noah</italic> is read, then the Wednesday of the week when the <italic>sidrah</italic> of <italic>Toldos</italic> is read, is considered her fixed period. In addition, she must also pay attention to the other occasional times of perception, whether based on equal intervening days, or on certain days of the month, as will be explained hereafter, God-willing. Whenever she has reason to expect her period, her husband must separate from her on the <italic>onah</italic> before, as has been explained.</p>
<p>4) Whenever a woman perceives blood, she must suspect perhaps she may perceive it again on the same date and at the same time. It goes without saying, if she presently does not have a regular menstrual period, she definitely must suspect that it might occur again at a similar time, and thus establish her date of menses. But even a woman who has a regular menstrual period, and experienced a change in regularity and perceived the flow not at her fixed period, must also be concerned with this perception, lest this indicate a change of her regular period to a different time. But if her regular period has not changed, and she has an additional perception, not at her regular period, then she does not have to be concerned (in the future) about this (extra) perception, for since she (also) has her regular period, she does not need to be concerned about an irregular period.</p>
<p>5) Let us give an illustration of a woman who has no regular periods. If she perceived blood on the second day of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>, of the month of <italic>Iyar</italic>, and again on the twenty-fifth of the same month, she must be mindful of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> of the month of <italic>Sivan</italic>, for she should suspect she might establish her menses on <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>. (Also on the second day of the month of <italic>Sivan</italic>, she must be mindful, because it is the &#x201C;average <italic>onah</italic> (period).&#x201D;) If <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> of <italic>Sivan</italic> came, (and the second day of <italic>Sivan</italic> too), and she has not yet perceived blood, she must suspect that she may establish her menses by equal intervening days. And since there was an interval of twenty-three days between perceptions, (exclusive of the day of the first perception and the second perception), she must now also count twenty-three days, and then expect another flow. That is, she has four remaining days of the month of <italic>Iyar</italic>, onto which she should add nineteen days from the month of <italic>Sivan</italic>, and expect a flow on the twentieth of the month. If the twentieth day of <italic>Sivan</italic> came, and she did not perceive blood, she must be mindful of the twenty-fifth day, as she may establish her menses on the twenty-fifth day of the month. (She must also be mindful on the twenty-sixth day, because it is the &#x201C;average <italic>onah</italic> (period).&#x201D;) However, for the <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> of <italic>Tammuz</italic> she need not be concerned, for her perception on <italic>Rosh Chodesh Iyar</italic>, has already been eliminated as a period by her failure to perceive blood on <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> of <italic>Sivan</italic>. (For whatever is not established by three (consecutive) occurrences, is nullified by a one-time failure to occur, as explained hereafter.)</p>
<p>6) An example of a woman who has a regular menses: she has an established menses of twenty-five day intervals, and one time a change occured, whereby she did not perceive until the twenty-eighth day. She must be mindful of the twenty-fifth day from this last perception, because this is her regular period. If the twenty-fifth day came and she has not perceived blood, she must take heed of the twenty-eighth day, because of her last perception. If she has perceived again on the twenty-eighth day, she is still forbidden (to her husband) on the twenty-fifth day after this last perception, because of her regular period. If now, too, she did not perceive blood on the twenty-fifth day, but rather on the twenty-eighth day, the twenty-eighth day is set as her fixed period while the twenty-fifth is eliminated, (for she has replaced it with another, three times,) and she is permitted [on the twenty fifth day]. If the last perceptions were not had at equal intervals, if she saw on the twenty eighth day, on the twenty ninth day, and on the thirty first day, her previous fixed period is eliminated, and now she has no established fixed period. She must, therefore, always be mindful of the equal interval from her last perception (31 days), and for the &#x201C;day of the month,&#x201D; and for the &#x201C;average period,&#x201D; until she establishes a new fixed period</p>
<p>7) This rule should guide every God-fearing person: If the woman has no regular period you should always write the date on which she perceived blood, the day of the month, and how many days elapsed between perceptions. You must always be mindful in the future of the intervening number of days between the last two periods. You must also be mindful of the day of the month, based on her last perception. You must also be mindful of the &#x201C;average <italic>onah</italic> (period).&#x201D; This is how you should conduct yourself until she establishes a regular period. After she establishes a regular period, if a change occurs in her period, you must also be careful to take notice of the new perception, with regard to both the number of intervening days, and the day of the month. You must also be careful to remember the day of her regular period because the regular period is eliminated only after three times, as stated hereafter.</p>
<p>8) A woman who has a fixed period, even if once or twice the date of her period (arrived), or her characteristic symptoms (arrived), and she did not perceive blood, even though she is certain beyond any doubt, that she did not perceive, for instance if during the entire period she had a cloth [or tampon] packed tightly in place,<sup><xref rid="fn985">11</xref></sup> still her regular period is not eliminated, and she must still be mindful of it even the third time. But if the third time also arrived and she did not perceive anything, if she is absolutely certain that she did not perceive anything on any of these three times; for instance, if at each time she had a cloth packed tightly into place throughout the date of her expected period, from then on her regular period has been eliminated, and she need not be concerned about it anymore. For every regular fixed period is eliminated after failing to happen three times, even if it was regular for many years. But a period which is not established, such as a perception that occured only once or twice, then if this day arrived, or this particular sign arrived one time, and she did not perceive her menstrual flow, even if she did not examine herself, as long as she did not feel anything, she no longer needs to observe this period. Whatever has not been established by three consecutive occurrences is eliminated by one time, even without examination.</p>
<p>9) If a woman has a regular fixed period, then before the time arrives when she regularly perceives, she should insert a cloth<sup><xref rid="fn985">11</xref></sup> so she will be sure (her menstrual flow has not begun), for otherwise, she must suspect that perhaps a drop of blood issued and disappeared without her being aware of it. If she failed to do so, and the time of her fixed period passed, she is forbidden to her husband<sup><xref rid="fn986">12</xref></sup> until she examines herself thoroughly. If during the time of her expected period, she bathed herself, the examination will be of no avail.<sup><xref rid="fn987">13</xref></sup> She must be stringent and consider herself to be in an unclean state, because it is presumed that the flux has come at its regular time. But if she does not have a regular period, but she is being mindful of an irregular period, if the time has passed and she has felt nothing even though she failed to examine herself, she is thereafter presumed to be menstrually clean. However, with regard to the average period, which is the thirtieth day, her status is like that of a regular (fixed) period, as has been stated above.</p>
<p>10) If a woman&#x2019;s flow continues two or three days, coming either in a flow or in drops, the day on which she begins to perceive is considered the principal day. Some authorities say that, nevertheless, she must always be mindful of all these days until they are eliminated.</p>
<p>11) Just as a woman must be mindful of the menstrual period as indicated by the monthly date of menstruation, and by the amount of intervening days, even after a single occurrence, so, too, must she be mindful of the menses indicated by physical symptoms alone, or in combination with (equal interval perceptions) after a single occurrence. And just as the menses based on monthly perceptions, and by the number of intervening days, if they are not established (three consecutive times), are eliminated by a one-time failure to occur, so, too, the menses based on bodily symptoms alone, or in combination with one of the above, are eliminated by a one-time failure to occur. And just as the menses of monthly perceptions, and of equal interval perceptions that have been established by three occurrences, are eliminated only by three successive occurrences (to the contrary), so, too, the menses based on bodily symptoms alone, or in combination with one of the above, after being established by three occurrences, are eliminated only by three successive occurrences to the contrary. For instance, if she has established a period based only on physical symptoms, for example, if thereafter she yawned three times, and did not perceive a flow, she no longer has to be mindful when she yawns again. If it is a period based on a combination when the fixed day arrives three times, and she yawned and did not perceive any flow, then the term is eliminated. But a change of days without yawning, or a change in yawning without a change in days, do not eliminate the term established by a combination of factors, because we require that this process of its elimination be similar to the process through which it was established.</p>
<p>12) A pregnant woman, after three months from the beginning of her pregnancy, and a woman while nursing a child, are presumed to have ceased their flow, and need not be concerned about their periods, even if they have an established periods. Nevertheless she must take heed of every perception just as a woman is required to be mindful of an irregular period. When the period of nursing is over, she must continue to observe her former periods. For instance, if she had an established period on the day of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>, she must immediately continue to expect its occurrence on the first <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>. But if she had a period of equal interval perceptions, she need not be concerned until she once again has a perception, and then she must be mindful of her customary interval between periods.</p>

<title>Chapter 156 Perception of Blood as a Result of Cohabitation</title>
<p>1) If a woman has an issue of blood as a result of marital intercourse, even if it did not occur during marital intercourse, but later that night, she is permitted to have marital relations again after she purifies herself, but they should be apprehensive of a repetition even after only one such occurrence. Thus if it occurred on the night of her immersion, then the next time she immerses, he must be separated from her on the night of her immersion, for we suspect that perhaps the immersion in conjuction with the intercourse, causes her to issue blood, and perhaps she will perceive blood on the night of the following immersion, during the very act of marital intercourse. But on the night of the third immersion, they are not bound to separate themselves, because the main cause for concern was due to the immersion, and since on the night of her second immersion she did not perceive any blood there is no cause for further concern. Likewise, if a perception occurred on the night following her immersion, they must separate themselves on the night following her second immersion but not after the third immersion.</p>
<p>2) However, since an unfavorable tendency has developed in this woman, therefore, even if she has regular periods, nevertheless, the next time she has marital intercourse, she must examine herself both before and after intercourse in order to ascertain whether she had a flow again as a result of marital intercourse. She should also be careful to immediately seek medical attention; and most certainly if it happened that she perceived blood during marital intercourse, or shortly thereafter, for if this occurs three successive times<sup><xref rid="fn988">1</xref></sup> she will be in a very perplexing position, and only with utmost difficulty can she be permitted to continue living with her husband.</p>
<p>3) If during marital intercourse, the woman feels that she has become menstrually unclean, she must immediately say to her husband, &#x201C;I have become unclean.&#x201D; He should not separate himself from her immediately while his organ is rigid, for this act in itself affords pleasure, but he must support himself on his hands and feet, and not upon her. He should be filled with fear and trembling because of this sinful occurrence, and when his organ relaxes, he should separate from her. He should consult a Rav to instruct him regarding a proper penance for this sin.</p>
<ftnote id="fn988">1. She becomes permanently forbidden to her husband if this happens three consecutive times immediately after cohabitation. The <italic>Makor Chaim</italic> says only if it happens within one half an hour after cohabitation; the <italic>Peri Deah</italic> suggests about fifteen seconds. In all cases, a competent Rav must be consulted.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 157 Pre-Nuptial Laws</title>
<p>1) A woman who is preparing herself for her wedding, must first count seven (menstrually) clean days, whether she is a minor who has never perceived blood, or whether she is an aged woman whose flow has long ceased. Nevertheless, we suspect that perhaps because of her anticipation, some drops of blood issued from her and disappeared. Therefore, we regard her as an actual <italic>niddah</italic>. After having counted the seven clean days, she must examine herself daily until she performs the ritual immersion and also after the immersion, until the ordained consummation of the marital act.<sup><xref rid="fn989">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) If the wedding was cancelled<sup><xref rid="fn990">2</xref></sup> for some reason, and afterward they agreed to hold the wedding, even though she had already counted seven clean days the first time, nevertheless she must count them anew, because a new desire has been created in her. Even if she has examined herself daily during the interval, it is of no avail. If it was not a definite cancellation, but they were unable to agree about the amount of the dowry, or the like, and because of this the wedding was delayed until they came to terms, or if they postponed the wedding by mutual consent, from the original day to a different day, they should consult a <italic>poseik</italic> to determine if the first clean days are of avail. If they quarreled at the wedding, and another groom took the place of the first, it is self evident that there is no validity to the seven clean days that she counted for the first bridegroom. But even if after consenting to marry the second groom, she became reconciled with the first one, there is no validity to the first seven clean days, because her thoughts were diverted from him. She must count anew, seven clean days.</p>
<p>3) A woman should be careful not to marry before she purifies herself from her unclean menstrual status. If it is urgent and the wedding must be held when she is still unclean, or if it occurred that she became menstrually unclean after the wedding ceremony, but before the consummation of the marital act; they are forbidden to be alone together without supervision, until she has performed the rite of immersion. It is customary to place a male child with the groom, and a female child with the bride. They may not be alone even during the daytime, without the children. The children must be old enough to understand something about marital relations. The girl should not be fully mature already having desire, lest she permit herself to be seduced, but of average maturity. Regarding this law there is no distinction between a groom who has never been married and a widower, or between a virgin and a widow; for so long as he has never had marital relations with that woman, we fear he may succumb to his passions, and therefore, they are prohibited to be alone, without supervision.</p>
<p>4) When one remarries the woman he divorced, she must count seven clean days. [This rule applies] even if he divorced her while she was pregnant, and remarried her while she is still pregnant, or he divorced her while she was nursing a child, and remarried her while she is still nursing. If he violated this rule and remarried her before [her seven clean days and immersion], they are permitted to be alone together. Since he already had marital relations with her, his impulse will not be so overpowering.</p>
<p>5) Extreme care should be taken that the groom should not lie next to the bride until the night he wishes to consummate their marriage.</p>
<p>6) One who marries a virgin should perform the ordained marital act, and even if there is an issue of hymenal blood, he should conclude the act and need have no scruples about it. However, after concluding the act, he must separate himself from her, and she is regarded as unclean. And even if no blood is perceived, we suspect perhaps a drop of blood issued from her, and was covered up by the semen. Therefore we regard her as menstrually unclean.</p>
<p>7) A virgin, who performed the rite of immersion after the first marital act, and perceived blood after the second marital act, and also after the third and fourth times; it is questionable (<italic>halachically</italic>) if she is permitted to remain with her husband.<sup><xref rid="fn991">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>8) It is permitted to perform the marital act with a virgin on <italic>Shabbos</italic> even though the act causes a bruise.</p>
<ftnote id="fn989">1. Even after the wedding, she must examine herself daily until the consummation of the first marital act. (<italic>Lechem V&#x2019;simla</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn990">2. If the groom cancelled but the bride did not give up the idea and he was convinced to go through with it, she does not need to count anew (<italic>Taz</italic>). If the bride made up her mind not to marry him, and then changed her mind, she must count anew (<italic>Aruch Hashulchan</italic>). The <italic>Makor Chaim</italic> say she does not need to.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn991">3. If however the marital acts were painful to her, the blood may be the result of the wound caused by the loss of her virginhood. A Rav must be consulted in any case.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 158 Childbirth and Miscarriage</title>
<p>1) A woman who has given birth whether she bore a living child or a dead one, or even if it was a miscarriage, even if she perceived no blood, she is regarded as unclean with the uncleanliness ascribed to birthgiving. The law prescribes that if the child was a male, the mother is unclean for seven days, (because of her) birthgiving, after which she may count seven clean days and perform the rite of immersion. If the baby is female, the mother is unclean for fourteen days (because of her) birthgiving, after which she counts seven clean days and performs the rite of immersion. There are places where the accepted custom is that woman do not perform the immersion within forty days of giving birth to a male, and within eighty days of giving birth to a female. In a community where this custom is uniformly accepted, it should not be treated lightly, for there is some reason for this. Concerning such instances it is said, &#x201C;Hear my son, the instruction of your father, and do not forsake the teaching of your mother.&#x201D; But in our regions, there is no established custom concerning this.<sup><xref rid="fn992">1</xref></sup> The custom prevailing in some communities that she should not immerse herself until six weeks after giving birth to a male, and nine weeks for a female, or similar customs, have no valid reason whatsoever, and have already been abolished in the holy communities by the <italic>Geonim</italic>, of blessed memory.</p>
<p>2) Some authorities maintain that you must separate from your wife the night of the forty-first day after having given birth to a male, and the night of the eighty-first day after having given birth to a female; for then there is the likelihood<sup><xref rid="fn993">2</xref></sup> she may perceive the flow the same as during her menses. Other authorities differ, but a scrupulous person should be strict about it. If she miscarried, and there is doubt if the fetus is male or female, you should separate from her the night of the forty-first day and the night of the eighty-first day.</p>
<p>3) If a woman suffered a miscarriage and expelled something even if it had no shape of a child, but looked like a piece of flesh or skin, or the like, she must be stringent and consider herself unclean as after the birth of a female, or she should consult a <italic>poseik</italic>, for sometimes it is possible to be lenient. Also, if she first miscarried a child, and thereafter dropped the afterbirth, although the child was a male, she must be observant of the uncleanliness due to birth of a female, because of the afterbirth<sup><xref rid="fn994">3</xref></sup> or seek the opinion of a <italic>poseik</italic>.</p>
<p>4) If a woman is certain she has not conceived, and performed the rite of immersion, and within forty days had a miscarriage, she need not deem it a birth, for the embryo is not formed in less than forty days. But she is menstrually unclean, even if no blood was perceived, for presumably there was some blood which may have disappeared, as it is impossible for the womb to have opened without issuing blood.</p>
<ftnote id="fn992">1. The <italic>Placey, Nodah Beyehuda</italic> Resp. 54 etc. were against this custom, as it can lead to very negative developments. If one&#x2019;s father did not have this custom, neither should he.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 159 Putting on White Linen and Counting the Clean Days</title>
<p>1) A woman who perceived blood during the days when she is menstrually clean, must count five days including the day on which she perceived, plus another four days. Even if she perceived it at the end of the day, after the congregation, and she herself have prayed the <italic>maariv</italic> service or ushered in the Shabbos; if it is still daytime, this day is counted as one of the five.<sup><xref rid="fn995">1</xref></sup> On the fifth day, towards evening before twilight, she should carefully examine herself, wash at least her pubic area and put on clean white undergarments. Her other garments should also be clean. This procedure is called <italic>hefsek tarahah</italic>. At night, she should spread a clean white sheet on her bed. The pillows and cushions should also be clean. The next day she should begin to count the seven clean days. It makes no difference whether she noticed much blood or little, for even if she saw only one drop, or she found only a stain during her period of purity, she must always wait another five days. Also, if she continues to bleed the entire five days, but the flow ceased before twilight (of the fifth day), immediately after the flow ceases, she may proceed with the <italic>hefsek taharah</italic>.</p>
<p>2) In case of emergency, as for instance, when she is traveling and cannot obtain water even to wash the pubic area, this does not delay (the <italic>hefsek taharah</italic>), but she must clean the area very well with whatever she can. If she is able to wash the area with urine, it is sufficient. If she does not have a fresh undergarment, she may put on an old one, provided it is first examined to ascertain that it is free from bloodstains.<sup><xref rid="fn996">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) Some authorities are of the opinion that if the congregation had recited the <italic>Maariv</italic> prayer, although it is still daytime, she cannot perform the <italic>hefsek taharah</italic> (on that day), in order to start counting<sup><xref rid="fn997">3</xref></sup> from the next day; since the congregation has already accepted it as night. Other authorities hold she is permitted to do this, even if the congregation already ushered in the <italic>Shabbos</italic>. It is best to be stringent about this, but if she had already done so, you need not be stringent, and she may perform the <italic>hefsek taharah</italic> so long as it is not yet twilight.<sup><xref rid="fn998">4</xref></sup> However, if she too had prayed <italic>Maariv</italic>, and certainly if she had already lit candles for <italic>Shabbos</italic> or <italic>Yom Tov</italic>, although it is still daytime, she can no longer perform the <italic>hefsek taharah</italic> (on that day.)<sup><xref rid="fn999">5</xref></sup> During the summer, when many congregations pray <italic>Maariv</italic> when it is still daytime, she should make her <italic>hefsek taharah</italic> before that time, as I have already stated. Then, when twilight draws near, she should examine herself again, for the principal time for <italic>hefsek taharah</italic> is as close to twilight as possible. In the event she did not examine herself that second time, you need not be concerned about it. Even if she only examined herself in the morning,<sup><xref rid="fn1000">6</xref></sup> when she (checked and) found herself clean, post factum, this is sufficient.</p>
<p>4) You should always instruct your household to be scrupulous that the examination of <italic>hefsek taharah</italic> be performed by inserting cotton cloth; which should remain there during the entire twilight. Such an examination will remove her from all possible doubt.<sup><xref rid="fn1001">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>5) There is a custom in some communities, that if the time for putting on white linen is on <italic>Shabbos</italic> or <italic>Yom Tov</italic>, it is postponed until later; because not every woman knows how to observe the laws prohibiting washing and wringing. In communities where the custom is to be lenient and she washes with cold water, she may even wash her entire body. But when using warm water, she must be careful to wash only the pubic area and between her thighs; and such water must have been warmed before <italic>Shabbos</italic> and before <italic>Yom Tov</italic>. She must also be careful not to transgress the prohibition of wringing. She should, therefore, not wash herself with a cloth, but only with her bare hands. On <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, she must not wash herself at all, but merely wipe herself thoroughly, (as this is considered an emergency, like the one stated in paragraph two, since she is forbidden to wash herself) and put on a freshly cleaned garment. On <italic>Tisha B&#x2019;Av</italic>, and in the seven days of mourning, she should also not wash herself, but merely wipe herself (thoroughly). She should also not put on a fresh garment, but an old one that was examined and found to be free of bloodstains.<sup><xref rid="fn1002">8</xref></sup> But after the seven days of mourning, although washing is forbidden the entire first thirty days (of mourning), nevertheless, she is permitted to wash herself lightly, for the purpose of wearing white (for the clean days), and she is allowed to put on a fresh gown.</p>
<p>6) Every day of the seven clean days, it is preferable that she examine herself twice daily; once in the morning and once near twilight. Post factum, even if she did not examine herself but once on the first day and once on the seventh day, you may be lenient about it. This is true only (if she examined herself) on the first and seventh days, but if she examined herself on the first and eighth days, then only the eighth day is counted and she is required to add another six days.<sup><xref rid="fn1003">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>7) All these examinations, whether of the <italic>hefsek taharah</italic>, or during the seven clean days, must be made with an<sup><xref rid="fn1004">10</xref></sup> old white linen cloth, or with a clean, soft, white cotton cloth. She must insert it deeply, and into the crevices, to a depth that the male organ penetrates, and then see if there is any reddish spot on it. If it is impossible for her to insert it to such a depth, she should at least examine herself to the best of her ability.<sup><xref rid="fn1005">11</xref></sup> It is important that at least one<sup><xref rid="fn1006">12</xref></sup> examination<sup><xref rid="fn1007">13</xref></sup> be made to the depth the male organ penetrates. (It is the duty of every husband to instruct his wife about the laws of examination, for many women are not familiar with them). Virgins who examine themselves before the wedding, should also examine themselves to the best of their ability.</p>
<p>8) The examinations must be made<sup><xref rid="fn1008">14</xref></sup> by the light of day and not by candle (artificial) light.<sup><xref rid="fn1009">15</xref></sup> Some stringent authorities void the purification if she had not made at least one examination on the first day and one examination on the seventh day by the light of day.</p>
<p>9) If she found a stain during the seven clean days, or even if she perceived a flow of blood, she may perform a <italic>hefsek taharah</italic> and put on the white garments on that very day, so long as it ceased before twilight; and on the following day she may start to count seven days anew.</p>
<p>10) Also a bride who perceived blood before her wedding, and if she must wait five days, the day of the wedding will be before the time of her ritual immersion, and it is difficult to postpone the wedding, she is allowed to make her <italic>hefsek taharah</italic> immediately, on the day the flow ceases, before twilight, and count seven clean days from the following day, in order to be able to immerse herself before the wedding. This is preferable to having the marriage ceremony take place when she is still menstrually unclean.</p>
<ftnote id="fn995">1. In the event she had waited only four days and then began her seven clean days she must add another clean day. If she had already performed the ritual immersion and thereafter had marital relations with her husband, she should not perform immersion again the next day (<italic>Sidrei Taharah</italic>). Even if she had immersed but had not yet had marital relations, the <italic>Maharashaam</italic> Responsa 40 rules that she should not repeat her immersion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn996">2. In the event that she had counted seven clean days, wearing a bloodstained undergarment, she need not count them over again. <italic>Pischei Teshuva</italic> 190:73&#x2014;<italic>Me&#x2019;il Tzeddakah</italic> Responsa 63.</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 160 How to Shampoo the Hair</title>
<p>1) On the seventh day [of purification,] during the daytime, before sunset, she should wash herself thoroughly with warm water, especially in places where there are wrinkles, and her hidden parts. She should wash thoroughly and examine her whole body in a room where she can see and feel efficiently with her hands. There should not remain any interposing<sup><xref rid="fn1010">1</xref></sup> particle or any dirt on her body. She must also thoroughly cleanse and comb all of her hair with a comb,<sup><xref rid="fn1011">2</xref></sup> and disentangle them so that they will not be matted together or knotted. This whole process is called <italic>chafifah</italic>. She must engage in <italic>chafifah</italic> until nightfall, in order to perform immersion immediately after <italic>chafifah</italic>; for preferably the <italic>chafifah</italic> should take place close to the [time of] immersion, and the <italic>chafifah</italic> should also take place in the daytime. Therefore, the proper procedure is to start the <italic>chafifah</italic> while it is yet day, and prolong it till nightfall.</p>
<p>2) The <italic>chafifah</italic> on places where there is hair, should not be done with anything that tends to entangle the hair.<sup><xref rid="fn1012">3</xref></sup> With regard to using soap, our custom is to be lenient because it cleanses well, and does not entangle the hair.</p>
<p>3) When there is no bath in the <italic>mikvah</italic>, and she must make <italic>chafifa</italic> at home and afterwards go to perform the immersion, she should take a comb with her, and comb her hair again at the <italic>mikvah</italic>.</p>
<p>4) In an emergency, when it is impossible for her to make the <italic>chafifah</italic> during the daytime, she can make it at night, but she must do it properly and not hurriedly. Also, if it is impossible for her to prolong the <italic>chafifah</italic> into the night, she may perform the entire <italic>chafifah</italic> in the daytime.</p>
<p>5) If her time for immersion is on Friday night, she should make the <italic>chafifah</italic> during the day. She must be very careful to complete the entire <italic>chafifah</italic> before twilight, and not, God forbid, violate the Shabbos. With regard to Shabbos candle lighting, it is best, if possible, for her to return home after the <italic>chafifah</italic>, or to make the <italic>chafifah</italic> at home, and after the <italic>chafifah</italic>, before twilight, she should light the candles and after that perform the immersion.<sup><xref rid="fn1013">4</xref></sup> If this is not possible, then her husband should light the candles instead. If this too is impossible, she should light the candles, and say the <italic>berachah</italic> over the candles while there is still plenty of time remaing in the day. Before lighting them she should declare that she is not assuming the [holiness of] Shabbos with the lighting; for when necessary such a stipulation is valid. But the practice of some women to say the <italic>berachah</italic> over the burning candles after their immersion, should be voided, for they are saying a <italic>berachah</italic> in vain.</p>
<p>6) In communities where it is customary to perform the ritual immersion after the close of <italic>Shabbos</italic> or <italic>Yom Tov</italic>, a Rav should be consulted as to how they should perform the <italic>chafifah</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1010">1. Between her body and the water of the <italic>mikvah</italic> (see chapt. 161)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1011">2. This is an injunction enacted by <italic>Ezra Hasofer</italic>. Checking her body for a <italic>chatsitsah</italic> before immersion, is a <italic>de&#x2019;oraisa</italic>.

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 161 What Constitutes a <italic>Chatsitsah</italic> (interposition)</title>
<p>1) She must immerse her entire body, and all her hair at one time. She must, therefore, be extremely careful while immersing, that there be nothing on her that would interpose [between the water and her body.] For even the slightest particle, at times is considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic> (an interposition), and renders her immersion invalid. Not only must the water reach the external part of her body, but even the internal parts of the body, which the water does not penetrate, must nevertheless be fit for the penetration of water. For example, although it is not necessary that the water enter her mouth, nevertheless, if there is an intervening particle between her teeth, her immersion is invalid, as will be explained, God willing. Every woman must know this rule: All parts of her body must be clean, and fit for the water to reach them during immersion.</p>
<p>2) When mucous is outside the eye, it is a <italic>chatsitsah</italic> (interposition) even if it is moist. Mucous inside the eye, it is not a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>, if it is moist but if it is dry, and has begun to turn green, it is considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1014">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) The dried blood on a wound is considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>, but the matter (pus etc.) that is inside the wound, is not considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. Discharged matter is not a <italic>chatsitsah</italic> when wet,<sup><xref rid="fn1015">2</xref></sup> but when dry, it is a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. Therefore, a woman who has scabs, must rub them in water until they soften. Even if it is painful to remove the crust of a wound, or if she has blisters, she must either remove them, or soften them well in water.</p>
<p>4) The plaster on a wound is considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. Sometimes plasters are applied to last for three or four months, and then fall off. During this time they cannot be removed without tearing the skin, and even if the woman says she is used to them and does not mind them, nevertheless, they are considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. A woman had a wound which opened, and gauze made of worn linen clothing was inserted into the hole (of the wound) underneath the bandage. Even if the bandage is removed and the gauze is not visible because it is deep inside, it is, nevertheless considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. (<italic>Teshuva Ma&#x2019;ahava</italic>)</p>
<p>5) Filth on the body that resulted from perspiration, is considered a (<italic>chatsitsah</italic>) when dry. When a persons hands are soiled with mud, dough or perspiration, and he rubs them together, crumb-like particles are formed, and they are considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>.</p>
<p>6) Ink, milk, honey, fig juice, berry juice, carob resin, juice of the fruit of the sycamore (which is a type of fig), are considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic> when dry, but are not a <italic>chatsitsah</italic> when moist. All other juices, even when moist are a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. Also blood, even when moist,<sup><xref rid="fn1016">3</xref></sup> is a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>.</p>
<p>7) The coloring used by women to color their faces, hands, and hair on their heads, is not considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. Also, a woman whose occupation is dyeing clothes, or similar work, and as a result her hands are colored, and all other women engaged in this occupation, usually do not mind this, it is not considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>.</p>
<p>8) Concerning dirt under the nails, there are a number of factors involved. It is already the established custom to cut the nails of the hands and the feet before the ritual immersion. She must be careful to burn them afterward, for if her husband should step on them, or if another man should step on them it is dangerous. (When she immerses) on Shabbos or Yom Tov, and has forgotten to cut them beforehand, some authorities permit her to have them cut<sup><xref rid="fn1017">4</xref></sup> (on Shabbos) by a non-Jewess. If she has a swelling over the nail, and is thus unable to cut it or to clean underneath it, and the swelling is so large that the dirt underneath it is not visible, it is not a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. If a woman forgot to cut her nails and performed the ritual immersion, and became aware of it before having marital relations with her husband, she must have another immersion. If she did not become aware of it until after having marital relations with her husband, she should consult a Rav.</p>
<p>9) She should be careful to remove her earrings and rings before the ritual immersion.</p>
<p>10) She must clean her teeth before immersing because it is common that remnants of food are found between the teeth. If she immersed herself and then found something between them or adhering to them, her immersion is invalid. Some women are accustomed not to eat meat the day they are to go to the <italic>mikvah</italic>, because meat gets between the teeth more so than other foods, and it is to be feared that even after cleaning some of it may remain; this is an excellent custom. On Shabbos and Yom Tov when we do eat meat, she must be careful to clean them very well. Every woman must be careful not to eat any food<sup><xref rid="fn1018">5</xref></sup> between the <italic>chafifah</italic> and the immersion. During the entire day of her immersion, she should not knead dough, or make wax candles, so that nothing will cling to her. But on Friday if it is her custom to knead the dough herself, in honor of Shabbos, she should not refrain from doing so; however, she must be careful to wash her hands thoroughly afterward.</p>
<p>11) A woman who has an artificial tooth, should consult a competent <italic>poseik</italic> concerning how to perform the immersion.<sup><xref rid="fn1019">6</xref></sup> A woman who has a lead filling<sup><xref rid="fn1020">7</xref></sup> in her dental cavities, and also a woman who is ruptured and wears a ring in her womb, should consult a competent <italic>poseik</italic>.</p>
<p>12) Another woman should not hold her during the immersion, because the water will not penetrate to the place within her grasp. In case of emergency, the woman who must hold her should first dip her own hands into the <italic>mikvah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1021">8</xref></sup> and afterward hold her. She should not hold her tightly with a strong grip, but with a moderate grip<sup><xref rid="fn1022">9</xref></sup> that people usually use.</p>
<p>13) Whenever possible she should not immerse in a place where there is mud on the bottom because it might be a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. In case of emergency, it is the custom to be lenient as the mud generally found in water is not very thick. But the mud found at the edge of a river which clings to the feet is considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. Therefore, she must be careful when going to immerse herself in the river to wash her feet well from the mud that stuck to her, from the edge of the river. If she wants to set something in the river under her feet upon which to stand during the immersion, she must consult a competent <italic>poseik</italic>, for there are many things upon which it is forbidden to stand during immersion.</p>
<p>14) She should not stand erect during immersion, because certain parts of her body are concealed by this posture; nor should she bend over so much that her hidden parts will be pressed together. But she must bend slightly, until the hidden places of her lower limbs are exposed as they are when she kneads dough, when she spreads her legs slightly in order to stand firm and knead briskly. Also, the space under her breasts should appear as it appears when she nurses a baby. She does not have to separate her thighs to any great extent, nor to extend her arms from her body too much, but they should be like they are when she walks. If she bends over too much, or stands up too erect, her immersion is invalid,<sup><xref rid="fn1023">10</xref></sup> because folds will have been formed in her body, and the water will not penetrate there. Therefore, it is necessary to watch that the water level be higher than three <italic>tefachim</italic> above her navel, for in such a manner, she will be able to immerse properly. In case of emergency, when the water level is not so high, she should slowly sit herself down in the water until it reaches her neck, and then immerse herself in a way that initially the part of her body still out of the water will not form any folds. The folds that form afterwards on her body while in the water do not matter, because the water has already penetrated there. If the water level is very low, then in an emergency, she may immerse herself in a prostrate position like a fish provided that her entire body and hair are submerged in the water at the same time.</p>
<p>15) She does not need to open her mouth to let the water in, nor should she close it too tightly. If she closed it tightly her immersion is invalid. Rather she should close her lips together in a natural way. If she put strands of her hair into her mouth when immersing, her immersion is invalid, because the water did not reach her hair.</p>
<p>16) She should not close her eyes tightly because folds will be formed under them, nor should she open them too much because folds will be formed above them, but she should keep them lightly closed.</p>
<p>17) She must remove the mucus from around the nose as well as from inside, but whatever is higher up in the nose, is not considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. Similarly, she must remove the wax from the ears. Some authorities say that she should pass water before immersing, if she needs to. She must also check if she needs to ease herself from stool or water, so she will not need to restrain herself and render that area impenetrable to water. If she did not do so, it does not invalidate the immersion.</p>
<p>18) She should not immerse herself with dust on her feet. If she did immerse herself and the dust was that thin that the water washed it away, the immersion is valid.</p>
<p>19) Ordinary lice and fleas do not cling to the body. Therefore the water penetrates and they are not considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. But the kind of lice that cling to the skin, and bite the skin where there is hair, and cling tightly to the skin, must be removed by means of hot water, or scraped off with the fingernail. If she is unable to remove them they do not constitute a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. The small lice that cling to the hair, must be removed because they do constitute a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>.</p>
<p>20) If a woman has elf-locks, called in Ashkenaz &#x201C;moertzep,&#x201D; or &#x201C;moer locken,&#x201D; and in Polish-Russian, &#x201C;kaaltanis,&#x201D; and it is dangerous to cut them, they do not constitute a (<italic>chatsitsah</italic>.) Even if there are some threads entangled in them, which cannot be removed, if they are not visible from the outside, they do not constitute a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1014">1. Most <italic>poskim</italic> maintain this does not apply to the laws of family purity, rather to laws of purity pertaining to sacrifices, food etc. (which at present are not possible to implement). The <italic>Shach</italic> 198:13 says if she cannot repeat her immersion, she may rely on this majority opinion and is permitted to her husband.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1015">2. The first three days it is considered wet (<italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 198:9).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1016">3. Only if it has begun to congeal so that if you touch it, it sticks to you and draws like a string. (<italic>Rashi, Maseches Menachos</italic> 21a.)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1017">4. <italic>Taz</italic> 198:21 forbids this and says she should immerse without having them cut, but should clean under them. <italic>Biur Halacha</italic> 340: 1 rules like <italic>Magein Avrohom, Nekudos Hakessef</italic>, and <italic>Shevus Yaakov</italic> Vol. 2 Responsa 8 that if need be she may have a non-Jewess cut them even with a clipper. The <italic>Chacham Tzvi</italic> does not permit having them cut with a tool. Toe nails should just be cleaned, rather than cut by a non-Jewess on Shabbos. (<italic>Biur Halachah</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1018">5. The <italic>Zerah Emess</italic> Vol. 3 Responsa 118 permits her to drink, in opposition to the <italic>Mekor Chaim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1019">6. As a general rule, if it is a permanent tooth it is not a <italic>chatsitsah;</italic> if it is removable (for cleaning purposes, etc., it is a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. (see <italic>Avnei Nezer</italic> Responsa 258, <italic>Shoel V&#x2019;maishiv Tinyana</italic> Vol. 3 Responsa 108, <italic>Igros Moshe</italic> Responsa 92.)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1020">7. Today&#x2019;s fillings are not a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>. See footnote 6. Some <italic>poskim</italic> permit immersion while having temporary fillings, for there is a set time in which they must be left in. Also even after their removal, the tooth is covered again by the new filling. See <italic>Igros Moshe</italic> Responsa 97. Some are stringent about this and require that the temporary filling be scheduled to remain in place at least for thirty days from the time of her immersion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1021">8. Wetting the hands in other water does not help. <italic>Ramah</italic> 120. Even if she wet her hands in the <italic>mikvah</italic>, and took her hands out of the <italic>mikvah</italic> and grasped her friend&#x2019;s arm outside the <italic>mikvah</italic>, it does not help, and is considered a <italic>chatsitsah</italic>&#x2014; <italic>Levush</italic> and <italic>Sidrei Taharah</italic>. However, the <italic>Gra</italic> says all water is valid, and even if she grasps her outside the <italic>mikvah</italic>, and even if she grasps her tightly, it is still valid. <italic>Taz</italic> says it need not be <italic>mikvah</italic> water, but he maintains it does not help if she holds her with a tight grip.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1022">9. This is done only in case of emergency, for we are not all experts to differentiate between an average grip and a strong one. (see <italic>Sidrei Taharah</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1023">10. <italic>Ra&#x2019;avad</italic>. However, the <italic>Sidrei Taharah, Chochmas Adam, Aruch Hashulchan</italic> etc. are lenient in this event. Therefore, if she already spent the night at home, she need not go back to repeat her immersion.</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Chapter 162 Immersion</title>
<p>1) If her husband is in town, it is the duty of a woman to immerse herself at the proper time, in order not to delay the mitzvah of propogation even for one night; for Joshua was punished for causing Yisrael to delay the mitzvah of propogation for one night. A woman who delays her immersion in order to torment her husband, will be severely punished, God forbid.</p>
<p>2) She is forbidden to immerse<sup><xref rid="fn1024">1</xref></sup> herself on the seventh (clean) day before the stars appear (nightfall). Even if she immerses close to nightfall, and will be unable to return home before dark, it is also forbidden. Even if she was delayed and did not immerse herself on the night following the seventh day, but is immersing herself afterwards, she is also forbidden to immerse in the daytime. In such a case, too, she should be strict and not immerse even shortly before dark,<sup><xref rid="fn1025">2</xref></sup> and not return home until dark. She should immerse herself only at night. Brides who immerse before the <italic>chupah</italic>, may immerse themselves on the eighth day or thereafter, during the daytime. In case of emergency, even if the bride must immerse on the seventh day, she may also immerse during the daytime, even in the morning after sunrise. But they should not make the <italic>chupah</italic> until the stars appear. If the bride immerses after the <italic>chupah</italic>, even though it is the first immersion of her married life, she is subject to the same laws as apply to any other woman.</p>
<p>3) In case of emergency, as when she is afraid to immerse at night on account of the cold or some other fear, or if the <italic>mikvah</italic> is outside the city, and the gates of the city are locked at night, she is allowed to immerse on the eighth day during the daytime. But on the seventh day, she is not allowed to immerse in the daytime even in the event of an emergency.<sup><xref rid="fn1026">3</xref></sup> She is permitted to immerse in the daytime on the eighth day in case of an emergency, only if she makes the <italic>chafifah</italic> then, immediately before the immersion. But if the eighth day is Shabbos or Yom Tov, in which case she would have to make the <italic>chafifa</italic> a day before her immersion, and then do the immersion in the daytime, such practice is forbidden, for two concessions may not be made in one case. (The concessions being, immersion in the daytime and a long interval between <italic>chafifa</italic> and immersion).</p>
<p>4) She should not stand on anything during the immersion. If the water of the <italic>mikvah</italic> is deep, and she must stand on a step, she must consult a <italic>poseik</italic>.</p>
<p>5) She must not immerse in a place where people might see her, for this might cause her to immerse hastily, and thus she may not immerse properly. If she has already performed the immersion, and she is positive she immersed properly, her immersion is valid.</p>
<p>6) When she immerses herself, she must have in attendance<sup><xref rid="fn1027">4</xref></sup> a Jewish woman, older than twelve years and one day, to see that none of her hair remains floating on the water.<sup><xref rid="fn1028">5</xref></sup> If there is no woman available, her husband may stand by her to see to it that she immerses properly.<sup><xref rid="fn1029">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>7) She is permitted to immerse on Friday night if it is the proper time for her immersion, and she was unable to immerse before this,<sup><xref rid="fn1030">7</xref></sup> and provided her husband is in town. But if her husband is out of town, or if she was able to immerse before, she is forbidden to immerse on Friday night.<sup><xref rid="fn1031">8</xref></sup> If it is after she had given birth, there are many intricate laws regarding if she is permitted to immerse on Friday night or not, so she should consult a <italic>poseik</italic>. A woman whose date of immersion was before Friday night, but she failed to immerse because her husband was out of town, and he arrived on Friday, in some communities they are strict and do not allow such an immersion on Friday night. In a community without an established custom one should not be strict about this. In communities where the custom is to be strict about Friday night immersions, she may not immerse even<sup><xref rid="fn1032">9</xref></sup> at the conclusion of Shabbos.<sup><xref rid="fn1033">10</xref></sup> A widow who got married (while menstrually unclean), is forbidden to immerse for her first time on Friday night since he is forbidden to have initial marital relations with her on Shabbos.<sup><xref rid="fn1034">11</xref></sup> (However) on the conclusion of Shabbos, some authorities are lenient and permit her to immerse.</p>
<p>8) After immersing properly, while she is still standing in the water, she should recite the <italic>berachah: Asher kideshanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu al hatevillah</italic>. (&#x201C;Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and has commanded us concerning immersion.&#x201D;) She should be strict,<sup><xref rid="fn1035">12</xref></sup> and before reciting the <italic>berachah</italic>, she should cover her lower limbs with a cloth, or at least hold her arms together on her body, to serve as a separation from her lower limbs. She should not look into the water while reciting the <italic>berachah</italic>. If she immerses in a place where she is able to make the water opaque by stirring it with her feet, it is best to do so before reciting the <italic>berachah</italic>. Some women are accustomed after reciting the <italic>berachah</italic> to immerse one more time, and this is a proper custom. If she does so, she must take care that the second immersion also be done properly.</p>
<p>9) After she has properly immersed in the mikvah she is permitted to enter the bath-house to warm herself, even if it is a steam bath. But according to some Poskim it is forbidden to wash again in a tub,<sup><xref rid="fn1036">13</xref></sup> and this is the prevailing custom. As far as pouring hot water on herself to warm her body, she may be lenient. But in a community where custom forbids this too, she may not be lenient.</p>
<p>10) A woman should be modest about her immersion, and conceal the date of her immersion. She should not go to the (<italic>mikvah</italic>) when people are about. [She should arrange it] so that people will not notice her. Concerning a woman who does not act modestly, it is said, &#x201C;Cursed be he who lies with any kind of animal.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1037">14</xref></sup> She should also take care when leaving the (<italic>mikvah</italic>) that her friend should meet her and touch her, so that she not be met first by an unclean thing such as a dog, a donkey, a pig, a horse, a <italic>metzorah</italic>, or similar things, or by a person, ignorant in Torah, and not God-fearing or a non-Jew. If any of these meet her (first), if she is God-fearing, she will return and immerse again. If one meets a woman leaving the (<italic>mikvah</italic>) after her immersion, he may expect some mishap, God forbid. To prevent this he should recite these two verses: &#x201C;He pours contempt upon nobles and causes them to wander, in the wasteland, where there is no path&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1038">15</xref></sup> and, &#x201C;He pours contempt upon nobles and he loosens the belt of the mighty.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1039">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>11) With regard to heating the water of the <italic>mikvah</italic>, some authorities forbid it and some authorities permit it. The prevailing custom in many communities is to permit it, but where no such custom prevails, one should not be lax about it. In a place where it is customary to permit immersion on Friday night, care must be taken that the water should not be hot, but lukewarm.<sup><xref rid="fn1040">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>12) With regard to immersion in rivers, according to many great <italic>halachic</italic> authorities, of blessed memory, the immersion in a river is valid only when it is so small that it is certain that the river did not increase due to rainwater or melted snow, because rainwater and melted snow purify only when they are gathered together and standing as a <italic>mikvah</italic>. But when they are flowing on the ground they do not purify. Only spring waters purify [even] when flowing on the ground. However, in an emergency, as when there is no <italic>mikvah</italic>, it is customary to be lenient, and to rely on the <italic>poskim</italic> who rule according to the <italic>poseik</italic> who says even when we see that the river was increased from the rain water, nevertheless, the major increase is from its source under the ground. For in time of rain, the air is full of moisture, and the sources of the springs increase and becomes stronger. Consequently, the water in the river is always mostly from underground springs, and the rainwater is nullified within it, and therefore it purifies even though it contains water that flowed on the ground. However, in a place where there is a <italic>mikvah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1041">18</xref></sup> far be it from anyone to be lenient about it. Even where there is no <italic>mikvah</italic>, if possible, it is best to be strict and if the river increased from rain water, she should postpone her immersion two or three days, until it resumes its normal level. It is best, if possible, not to immerse in the place where the river was widened, but rather in the place where it flows continuously; for in that case there is somewhat more ground for leniency.</p>
<p>13) With regard to a river which is formed entirely by rain and at times completely dries up, although during the rainfall some other streams empty into it, nevertheless, since occasionally it dries up completely, there are no grounds to permit immersion in it while the water is flowing on the ground, until the water gathers and remains standing.</p>
<p>14) The laws regarding <italic>mikvah</italic> are very numerous. Wherever a <italic>mikvah</italic> is being made, it should be constructed only under the supervision of a very renowned <italic>poseik</italic>, great in Torah and in fear of God. When any change occurs (in the <italic>mikvah</italic>), whether a minor or major (change), a competent <italic>poseik</italic> should be consulted immediately.

<title>Chapter 163 The Laws of Circumcision</title>
<p>1) It is a positive mitzvah for the father to circumcise his son, or to grant the honor and appoint another Jew as his agent to circumcise him. The father should place the infant on the knees of the <italic>sandek</italic>, hand over the knife to the <italic>mohel</italic>, and stand by him during the circumcision, to indicate that the <italic>mohel</italic> is his agent. In the interval between the cutting of the foreskin and its laceration, the father recites the <italic>berachah, Asher kideshanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu lehachniso</italic> etc. &#x201C;Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us to induct him into the covenant of our father <italic>Avrohom</italic>.&#x201D; You should make an effort to find the best and most righteous <italic>mohel</italic> and <italic>sandek</italic>. It is customary not to select as <italic>sandek</italic>, a man who had already been <italic>sandek</italic> at the circumcision of another one of his sons.<sup><xref rid="fn1042">1</xref></sup> If you have invited a <italic>mohel</italic>, it is forbidden to retract and invite another one, for it is said, &#x201C;The remnant of Yisrael will do no injustice and will speak no falsehood.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1043">2</xref></sup> If you appointed a <italic>mohel</italic>, and in the meantime the <italic>mohel</italic> left the city, and the father, thinking that he would not return in time for the circumcision, appointed another (in his stead), but in the meantime the original <italic>mohel</italic> returned, he should perform the circumcision.</p>
<p>2) It is customary that all those attending a circumcision, stand throughout the ceremony, for it is said, &#x201C;And all the people stood in the covenant,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1044">3</xref></sup> excepting the <italic>sandek</italic>, who holds the baby while seated. After the father recites the <italic>berachah, Lehachniso</italic>, and those assembled answer <italic>amein</italic>, they all say, &#x201C;Just as he was initiated into the covenant, so may he be initiated into the study of Torah, to the <italic>Chupah</italic>, and to the performance of good deeds.&#x201D;</p>
<p>3) It is essential that the <italic>mohel</italic> be versed in the laws of circumcision, and he must examine the child to see if he is healthy. The midwife (nurses etc.) should be alerted that in case she observes some weakness or illness in the child, she should notify the <italic>mohel</italic>.</p>
<p>4) Extreme care must be taken not to circumcise a child who is possibly ill, for danger to human life overrides all other consideration. Moreover, the circumcision can be performed at a later date, but it is impossible to ever restore one Jewish life. See <italic>Yoreh Deiah</italic>, Chapters 262,263 as to when to circumcise an infant who had been ill and recovered. As soon as the infant is fit for circumcision, it is forbidden to defer the mitzvah for any reason, such as to elaborate the festivities or the like. You must circumcise him immediately when he is fit, but you may not do so on Shabbos or on Yom Tov, as is stated in <italic>Yoreh Deiah</italic> Chapter 266.</p>
<p>5) If a woman has lost two sons from the effect of circumcision, as it appears that the circumcision had weakened their strength, you may not circumcise the third son until he gets older and stronger. Also a woman who lost a child from the effect of circumcision, and the same thing happened to her sister&#x2019;s son, then the other sisters, too, should not have their sons circumcised until they get older and stronger.</p>
<p>6) If a baby is born during twilight, or close to it, you must consult a competent <italic>poseik</italic> as to when he should be circumcised.</p>
<p>7) An infant who dies before circumcision (whether within the eight days or thereafter,) is circumcised at the grave in order to remove (the foreskin) which is a disgrace to him, so he should not be buried with his foreskin which is considered a disgrace to him.<sup><xref rid="fn1045">4</xref></sup> No <italic>berachah</italic> is recited on this circumcision, but a name is given to him as a remembrance that mercy will be shown him from Heaven and he will be included in the resurrection of the dead, and that he may then have sufficient understanding to recognize his father and his mother. If they forgot to circumcise him, and they had already buried him with his foreskin, if they became aware of it immediately, when there is as yet no reason to suspect that the body has begun to decompose in the grave, they should open the grave and circumcise him. But if they had not become aware of it until several days after his death, his grave should not be opened (<italic>Nodah Beyehudah Tinyana</italic> No. 164).</p>
<p>8) It is customary to make a feast on the day of the circumcision; for every mitzvah which Jews accepted with joy, (like the precept of circumcision), they still perform with joy. It is written, &#x201C;I am happy with your word&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1046">5</xref></sup> etc. and the Sages<sup><xref rid="fn1047">6</xref></sup> explain that this refers to circumcision. He who can afford to make a proper feast, but economizes, and makes it only with coffee and sweets, or the like, does not act properly. If you are invited to a circumcision feast, and you know that worthy men will be present, you are obligated to attend. It is also customary to make a feast of various fruits and drinks on the Friday night before the circumcision.<sup><xref rid="fn1048">7</xref></sup> This feast is also considered a mitzvah.<sup><xref rid="fn1049">8</xref></sup> It is also customary that the night prior to the circumcision, people assemble in the house where the baby is, and study Torah. Some refreshments are served, but this feast is not considered a mitzvah, for it is merely a custom.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 164 The Redemption of The Firstborn</title>
<p>1) It is a positive mitzvah incumbent on every Jewish man to redeem his son from a <italic>kohein</italic>, if his son is the mother&#x2019;s firstborn child. This is done by giving the <italic>kohein</italic> five <italic>selaim</italic>. Our coinage must be of sufficient value, so that their sum equals five and one-third <italic>loit</italic> of refined silver.<sup><xref rid="fn1050">1</xref></sup> You may give the <italic>kohein</italic> even other articles of that value, but not real property or notes. Therefore you may not redeem your son with paper money. It is customary to make a feast when performing this mitzvah.</p>
<p>2) If you told a particular <italic>kohein</italic> that you will redeem your son from him, you are forbidden to retract your word, but if you did retract and redeemed him from another <italic>kohein</italic>, the redemption is valid.</p>
<p>3) You cannot redeem the firstborn before he is fully thirty days old, and on the thirty-first day you should redeem him immediately, and not postpone the performance of the mitzvah. You may not redeem him on Shabbos or Yom Tov,<sup><xref rid="fn1051">2</xref></sup> but you may redeem him on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1052">3</xref></sup> It is customary to do the redemption during the daytime. However, if the thirty-first day has passed, and you have not yet redeemed the infant, or if that day is on Shabbos or Yom Tov or on a fast day, you should redeem him immediately on the following night, and not wait until the next day, thus, further postponing the mitzvah.</p>
<p>4) The father brings the firstborn before the <italic>kohein</italic> and informs him that the infant is the firstborn to his mother, who is an Israelite (i.e. she is not the daughter of a <italic>kohein</italic> or Levi). He brings the money, or goods worth five <italic>selaim</italic>, and places it before the <italic>kohein</italic>, and says to the <italic>kohein</italic>, &#x201C;This is my firstborn son,&#x201D; etc. and then places the infant before the <italic>kohein</italic>. The <italic>kohein</italic> asks him, &#x201C;What would you rather,&#x201D; etc., and the father responds, &#x201C;I want to redeem my son,&#x201D; etc. While the father still holds the coins in his hand, before giving them to the <italic>kohein</italic>, he recites the <italic>berachah: Asher kideshanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu al pidyon habben</italic> &#x201C;Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and has commanded us concerning redemption of the firstborn son.&#x201D; He also recites the <italic>berachah, Shecheyanu</italic>, and then immediately gives the coins to the <italic>kohein</italic>. The <italic>kohein</italic> takes the money, and revolves it over the child&#x2019;s head, and says, <italic>Zeh tachas zeh</italic> etc. &#x201C;This (money) instead of this (child).&#x201D; Afterwards he places his hand on the boy&#x2019;s head and blesses him, saying, <italic>Yesimcha Elokim</italic> etc. &#x201C;May God make you etc;&#x201D; <italic>Yevarechechah Hashem Veyishmerechah</italic>, May God bless you and keep you; <italic>Ki orech yomim ushnos chaim</italic> etc. &#x201C;For length of days and years of life,&#x201D; etc. <italic>Adonoy Yisumarchah mikol rah</italic> etc. &#x201C;God shall guard you from all evil&#x201D; etc.). Thereafter the <italic>kohein</italic> recites a <italic>berachah</italic> over a cup of wine. If no wine is available, he may recite a <italic>berachah</italic> over some other beverage which is commonly used in the region. But if so, the redemption should take place before the hands are washed for the meal, for during the meal, it is not permitted to recite a <italic>berachah</italic> over any beverage (other than wine). This is not the case when there is wine, for then the redemption takes place after the <italic>Hamotzi</italic> has been recited over the bread.</p>
<p>5) If the father is not with his son, he may redeem his son from a <italic>kohein</italic> wherever he is. In such an event he says to the <italic>kohein</italic>, &#x201C;I have a firstborn son to redeem,&#x201D; whereupon the <italic>kohein</italic> inquires: &#x201C;What would you rather,&#x201D; etc.</p>
<p>6) The <italic>Turei Zahav</italic> gives a reason for the custom of having the <italic>kohein</italic> return all the redemption money or part of it to the father, (and [even] this requires further deliberation). He who desires to perform the mitzvah properly, should choose a <italic>kohein</italic> who is poor, who is learned in Torah and is God-fearing, and both the father and the <italic>kohein</italic> should agree that the money is not to be returned,<sup><xref rid="fn1053">4</xref></sup> or else the father should give it explicitly as a gift on condition that the <italic>kohein</italic> return it to him.</p>
<p>7) The mother is not obligated to redeem her son; and if the father has died, the <italic>Beis Din</italic> (Jewish court) redeems him.</p>
<p>8) If the father violated the law, and did not redeem his son, or if the father died and the <italic>Beis Din</italic> failed to redeem him, he himself is obligated to redeem himself when he becomes Bar Mitzvah, at which time he recites the <italic>berachah, Asher kideshanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu al pidyon bechor</italic> &#x201C;Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the redemption of the firstborn.&#x201D; He also recites the <italic>berachah, Shehecheyanu</italic>.</p>
<p>9) <italic>Kohanim</italic> and Levites are exempt from redeeming their firstborn sons. Even if the daughter of a <italic>kohein</italic> or a Levite is married to an Israelite, the son is exempt from redemption. If the daughter of a <italic>kohein</italic> had sexual relations with a non-Jew and has become pregnant from him, or even if she had thereafter become pregnant from a legal marriage, the son must be redeemed, for his mother was disqualified from the <italic>kehunah</italic> (priesthood) by having cohabitation with a non-Jew. (This also applies to any illicit cohabitation through which his mother&#x2019;s priesthood is profaned.)</p>
<p>10) If a woman had a miscarriage and thereafter has given birth to a viable child, a Rav should be consulted (regarding his redemption).</p>
<ftnote id="fn1050">1. This is an old measure. In todays measure it is 96 grams or its equivilent at the time of the Redemption. When old coins are going to be used, their silver content must be verified.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1051">2. Because it is similar to buying and selling, which is forbidden on Shabbos and Yom Tov. (Shach 305:12, Rivash, Responsa 152)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1052">3. <italic>Ramah</italic> 305:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1053">4. If the father had in mind that the <italic>kohein</italic> will return it but the <italic>kohein</italic> was not aware of it, the redemption is invalid, even if the <italic>kohein</italic> returns the money.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 165 The Training of Children</title>
<p>1) Every<sup><xref rid="fn1054">1</xref></sup> father is obligated to train his young children<sup><xref rid="fn1055">2</xref></sup> in the practice of all the <italic>mitzvos</italic>, both Biblical <italic>mitzvos</italic>, and <italic>mitzvos</italic> that are Rabbinically ordained. They should be trained to do each mitzvah, in accordance with his or her intelligence. It is also his obligation to prevent them from doing any forbidden act,<sup><xref rid="fn1056">3</xref></sup> as is said in the Scriptures, &#x201C;Train a child in the way he should go,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1057">4</xref></sup> etc. If words are of no avail, you should chastise him with a rod, or the like. But you should not strike him severely as some fools do; a wise person will act intelligently. It is especially important to watch that they tell no lies,<sup><xref rid="fn1058">5</xref></sup> and to train them to speak the truth, and to avoid oaths. The above things are mandatory upon fathers as well as teachers.</p>
<p>2) The time for training a child in the performance of positive commandments is set for each child according to his wisdom and understanding. For example, when he knows the significance of Shabbos, it is his duty<sup><xref rid="fn1059">6</xref></sup> to hear <italic>kiddush</italic> and <italic>havdalah</italic>, and other similar things. Training the child to keep the prohibitive commandments, whether Biblical or Rabbinical, applies to every child, who understands when he is told that something is forbidden to do or forbidden to eat.<sup><xref rid="fn1060">7</xref></sup> Young children should be trained to answer <italic>Amein</italic> in the synagogue, and to participate in other aspects of synagogue prayer. From the time a child answers <italic>Amein</italic> [to a berachah] he has a share in the World to Come.<sup><xref rid="fn1061">8</xref></sup> They must be trained to behave in the synagogue with awe and reverence. Children who run about to and fro, and disturb the prayers, should not be brought to the synagogue.<sup><xref rid="fn1062">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) Even one who is not the father of the child is forbidden<sup><xref rid="fn1063">10</xref></sup> to give him<sup><xref rid="fn1064">11</xref></sup> forbidden food to eat, or to tell him to do something that is forbidden. According to most <italic>poskim</italic>, it is forbidden to give him food that is Rabbinically prohibited, or to command him to do something that is Rabbinically prohibited. If the child is somewhat ill and must eat forbidden food, he may be fed by a non-Jew with food which was forbidden only by Rabbinic Law.</p>
<p>4) Something which is not forbidden in and of itself, but is forbidden because of the special day, is not included in the mitzvoh of training. Therefore, it is permitted to give a child food, to eat before <italic>kiddush</italic> even though it is your duty, to train him to make <italic>kiddush</italic>, but it is forbidden to give him food [to eat] outside the <italic>sukkah</italic>. Only (in cases like) not eating before <italic>kiddush</italic>, which is similar to a negative commandment, since it is forbidden to eat before <italic>kiddush</italic>, is the law more lenient; but where a violation of a positive command is involved, it is forbidden to give it to him.</p>
<p>5) It is forbidden to tell a child even if he is under the age of nine, to carry anything out on Shabbos, even for the purpose of doing a mitzvah, like taking a Siddur (prayer book) or a Chumash (Bible) to the synagogue, or similar things.<sup><xref rid="fn1065">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) If a child steals something, if it is still intact, you are obligated to return it; but if it is no longer intact, he is legally exempt from making restitution even after he becomes of age. But in order to fulfill his obligation before the judgement in Heaven, he must make restitution when he becomes of age. Similarly, if he committed other sins in his youth [before Bar Mitzvah], it is advisable that he accept upon himself some sort of repentance when he reaches an age of understanding. Concerning this it is said, &#x201C;For the soul to be without knowledge is not good.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1066">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>7) You should not threaten a child that you will hit him after a while, but if you see him misbehave, either hit him at once or ignore it. A story is told about a child who ran away from school, and his father threatened to hit him.<sup><xref rid="fn1067">14</xref></sup> The child committed suicide. Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said,<sup><xref rid="fn1067">14</xref></sup> In dealing with your impulse, your child or your wife; your left hand should repel [reject] and your right hand should bring near [accept]. You should not threaten a child with an unclean object.<sup><xref rid="fn1068">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>8) <italic>Halachically</italic>, it is permitted to allow a Jewish child to be nursed by a gentile woman. Nevertheless, if it is possible to have him nurse from a Jewess, you should not let him nurse from a gentile, for it dulls the spiritual sensitivities of the heart, and causes bad temperament. Also, a Jewish woman who is nursing and must eat forbidden foods as a remedy for illness, if possible, she should not nurse the child on those days.</p>
<p>9) Every father is obligated to teach his son Torah, as it is said, &#x201C;And you shall teach them to your children to speak of them.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1069">16</xref></sup> Just as it is a mitzvah to teach your son, so too it is a mitzvah to teach your son&#x2019;s son, as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn1070">17</xref></sup> &#x201C;And you shall make them known to your sons and to your son&#x2019;s son.<sup><xref rid="fn1071">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>10) As soon as the child begins to talk, you should teach him (the verse), &#x201C;The Torah that Moses has commanded us is a heritage for the community of Jacob,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1072">19</xref></sup> and, also the verse of <italic>Shema Yisrael</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1073">20</xref></sup> etc. (However you must be very careful that the child is clean when you are teaching him.) Likewise you should teach him other verses little by little, until he is strong enough to attend school, at which time you should engage a teacher for him. You should be careful to choose a teacher who is God-fearing, in order that he accustom the child from his youth to be God-fearing. When the child has advanced to the study of the Scriptures, it is customary to begin teaching him the <italic>Sidrah</italic> of <italic>Vayikra</italic>, which is the <italic>Sidrah</italic> containing the laws of sacrificial offerings, for our Sages of blessed memory said, Let those who are pure (the children) come and engage in the study of purity.<sup><xref rid="fn1074">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>11) The teacher must teach the children the entire day and part of the evening, in order to train them to study Torah by day and by night. He must not interrupt the childrens&#x2019; learning except on <italic>erev</italic> Shabbos and on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov at the end of the day. The children are not to be interrupted from their learning even for the purpose of building the Beis HaMikdosh</p>
<p>12) A teacher who leaves the children to themselves and goes out, or does some other work with them, or who teaches carelessly, is included in, &#x201C;Cursed be he who does the work of God with a slack hand.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1075">22</xref></sup> Therefore, you should appoint as a teacher, only a person who is God-fearing, fluent in his reading as well as exacting. A teacher should not stay awake at night more than necessary, so that he will not be lazy while teaching during the day. He should also not fast or eat and drink too sparingly. Nor should he eat and drink excessively, for all these things prevent him from teaching efficiently. Any teacher who deviates from these rules, forfeits his rights and should be dismissed.</p>
<p>13) A teacher should not strike his pupils as one strikes an enemy, [or with] malice and cruelty, nor with a whip or a stick, but with a light strap.</p>
<p>14) You should not teach the children anything new on Shabbos, i. e. something they have never learned before, because it is too burdensome to do on Shabbos. But something they once read, should be reviewed with them on Shabbos.</p>
<p>15) If a minor finds something, and certainly if someone gave him something as a gift, it is forbidden to rob him of it.</p>
<p>16) You may not give a Jewish child to a non-Jew to instruct him in reading and writing or to teach him a trade, and needless to say, that it is forbidden to give him to a Jewish heretic, which is much worse (than giving him to a non-Jew), for there is concern the child may follow in his footsteps.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1054">1. Some say every mother too. See <italic>Mishna Berurah</italic> 343:5. Others say if he has no father, his mother and <italic>Beis Din</italic> are responsible to train him. (see <italic>Mishna Berurah</italic> 640:5)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1055">2. After his Bar Mitzvah, you are as responsible for him as you are for your fellow Jew and must reprimand him when necessary and direct him to do what is right. (see <italic>Mishna Berurah</italic> 225:7)</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 166 Prohibition of Omens and Auspicious Times</title>
<p>1) It is written, &#x201C;You must not practice superstition nor attribute significance to [auspicious] times.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1076">1</xref></sup> What constitutes superstition? He who says, &#x201C;Since the bread fell from my mouth;&#x201D; or &#x201C;The cane fell from my hand;&#x201D; or &#x201C;My son called me from behind;&#x201D; &#x201C;A raven croaked at me;&#x201D; &#x201C;A deer crossed my path;&#x201D; &#x201C;A snake passed on my right;&#x201D; &#x201C;A fox passed on my left, therefore, I will not go on this journey because I will not be successful.&#x201D; Similarly, those who on hearing the chirping of a bird, say: &#x201C;May it mean this and not that;&#x201D; &#x201C;(Now I know) it is good to do this, or it is bad to do this;&#x201D; Similarly, when asked to repay a loan, he says: &#x201C;Please leave me alone for now it is morning, and I do not want to start the day by making a payment;&#x201D; or &#x201C;It is the close of the Shabbos;&#x201D; or &#x201C;It is the New Moon.&#x201D; Similarly those who say, &#x201C;We must slaughter this rooster because he crowed in the evening;&#x201D; or &#x201C;This hen (should be slaughtered) because she crowed like a rooster.&#x201D; Everything similar to these things, are forbidden. Anyone who practices any of these things, violates a negative command. Some <italic>poskim</italic> say that if you do not state the reason why you ordered the slaughter of the hen or the rooster, but simply say, &#x201C;Slaughter this hen&#x201D; or &#x201C;This rooster,&#x201D; it is permissible to slaughter them, and such is the prevailing custom.</p>
<p>2) Although no superstition may be practiced through a house, a child, and a woman, they may be regarded as omens. For example, if someone built a house, or had a child born to him, or taken a wife, and afterwards he was successful on three occasions, or was unsuccessful, he may regard this as an omen for the future,<sup><xref rid="fn1077">2</xref></sup> and say: &#x201C;This house brings me good luck&#x201D; etc. It is also permitted to inquire of a child about the verse he studied (that day), and rely on it to do a certain thing, for it is regarded somewhat like a prophecy. Some <italic>Poskim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1078">3</xref></sup> say it is permitted to designate a sign for the future (and to act accordingly): as Eliezer the servant of Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn1079">4</xref></sup> or Yonason the son of Saul; while other <italic>Poskim</italic> forbid it.<sup><xref rid="fn1080">5</xref></sup> However, he who walks in integrity; &#x201C;And trusts in God, kindness surrounds him.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1081">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) What is meant by &#x201C;auspicious times?&#x201D; One who believes in astrology and thus says, &#x201C;This day is good and this day is bad;&#x201D; or this day is a good day to do this work; or this year or this month is bad for such and such a thing. Regarding our custom to hold marriages only on the days when the moon, progresses to its fullness, this is not considered superstition or auspicious, for this is done only as a favorable sign, as the coronation of Kings which were held at springs to symbolize the permanency of his rule. Similarly, it is a good sign to make a wedding on a day when the moon (progresses) to its fullness. Nevertheless it is not proper to postpone a wedding on this account, and needless to say, you should certainly not make the wedding when the bride is menstrually unclean, on the account of this custom. It is also customary to begin to study on the New Moon. The custom of not starting anything on Monday or Wednesday, is permissible according to some authorities.<sup><xref rid="fn1082">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>4) Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, also said, &#x201C;What is meant by <italic>meonein?</italic> It refers to one who deceives the eyes. [a magician] In other words, it is as though he holds peoples eyes and closes them, for he deceives them. It seems to them as though he is performing wondrous, supernatural feats, while in reality he is doing nothing, but with slight of hand and cunning, he deceives them. The entertainers who perform these things at weddings, are violating a negative command. He who engages them, is guilty of transgressing (the negative command), &#x201C;Before the blind you shall not place a stumbling block.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1083">8</xref></sup> Therefore whoever is able to prevent this, is obligated to prevent it. And it is certainly forbidden to view these things but if a non-Jew performs these things, it is permitted to view it.</p>
<p>5) It is forbidden to consult sorcerers unless there is danger to human life,<sup><xref rid="fn1084">9</xref></sup> or if someone fell ill due to witchcraft, or some mishap or evil spirit, then he is permitted to be cured by a non-Jewish sorcerer.</p>

<title>Chapter 167 Laws Concerning Idolatry</title>
<p>1) It is forbidden to benefit from idols, from its vestments, ornaments and sacrifices. If any of these things are mingled with even one thousand legitimate items, it is forbidden to derive benefit from the entire lot. What are considered its vestments? The vessels that the priest uses for sacrificial purposes, such as pans and goblets, also the house (church) that is used exclusively for its worship, the base upon which the idol stands, also, the musical instruments that are used to play music before it. What are considered its ornaments? The candles that are lit before it, the garments that are used to clothe it, or those used to spread before it for beauty, and the trees that they are accustomed to plant in front of the idols to beautify them. These are its ornaments and it is forbidden to benefit from them, and it is therefore forbidden to sit in the shade of these trees. What are its sacrifices? The various kinds of food that are placed before it.</p>
<p>2) The idols of a non-Jew, its vestments and ornaments,<sup><xref rid="fn1085">1</xref></sup> can be annulled. Thus, if the heathen actually defaces them so that they can no longer be used as idols, or as vestments or ornaments to idols, it is permitted to benefit from them. But for idols of a Jewish heretic, the law of annullment does not apply.</p>
<p>3) It is permitted to benefit from candles that were lit (in front of an idol), and thereafter extinguished by a heathen, to be used for his own benefit, and were subsequently sold to a Jew. Since the heathen extinguished them to use for his own purpose, this act constitutes their annulment. Nevertheless, such candles should not be used for the performance of a <italic>mitzvah</italic>. Similarly, everything that was used for an idol, although it has been annulled, and is permitted for common use, is forbidden to be used for a <italic>mitzvah</italic> because they are abominable to the Almighty.</p>
<p>4) Regarding the clothing that the priests wear when they enter the house of idol worship, some <italic>Poskim</italic> maintain that they are ornaments of the priests and not ornaments of the idols, and therefore do not require annulment; while other <italic>Poskim</italic> require their annullment.</p>
<p>5) A cross to which they bow down, is a forbidden object unless it is annulled, but a cross that is hung around the neck, as a momento is a permitted object [from which profit may be derived].</p>
<p>6) It is forbidden to make anything that is needed for idols; even windows for the house of idol worship. It is forbidden to sell books that are exclusive to idol worship, [or books of Biblical Scriptures, that were copied with alterations designed to make them heretical and to strengthen their beliefs.] Similarly, selling them something that they need for their worship is forbidden, if they cannot purchase them elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="fn1086">2</xref></sup> Some <italic>Poskim</italic> forbid this even when they are able to purchase the same thing elsewhere, and a righteous person, should be strict regarding this.<sup><xref rid="fn1087">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>7) It is forbidden to gaze at an idol or at its ornaments, as it is said, &#x201C;Do not turn to idols.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1088">4</xref></sup> You must keep a distance of four <italic>amohs</italic> from a house of idolatry, and certainly from the idol itself so as not to pass by them. It is forbidden to listen to their musical instruments, or to smell their incense. If you hear their musical instruments, you should plug your ears, and if the aroma of their incense comes to you, have in mind not to derive pleasure from it.</p>
<p>8) If you see houses of idolatry in a settled state<sup><xref rid="fn1089">5</xref></sup> you should say: &#x201C;God will uproot the house of the haughty.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1090">6</xref></sup> (If you see them) in a state of destruction, you should say: &#x201C;Almighty of vengeance, God, Almighty of vengeance, reveal Yourself.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1091">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>9) If a splinter has lodged in your foot, or if your coins were scattered, in front of an idol, you must not bend down to remove the splinter, or to gather the coins, because it would appear as though you are bowing to the idol. Even if there is no one to witness it, it is nevertheless forbidden. You should rather sit down, or turn your back, or your side to the idol and then take whatever you need.<sup><xref rid="fn1092">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>10) There is an authority who says that it is forbidden to lend money for the purpose of building a house of idolatry, or for their ornaments or for their staff. And you most certainly are forbidden to sell them ornaments. He who refrains from doing these things will prosper. You should not bind books dealing with idolatry; except for their law books and literature. [Even] if you fear this will incur their hatred, nevertheless, whatever you can do to evade doing so, you must evade it.</p>
<p>11) In a place where Gentiles assemble, and say that there they are forgiven their iniquities, it is forbidden to do business with them there.<sup><xref rid="fn1093">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>12) It is forbidden to mention the name of an idol, whether for some purpose, like saying to your friend: &#x201C;Wait for me near such and such idol,&#x201D; or without a purpose, as it is said, &#x201C;And the name of other gods you shall not mention.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1094">10</xref></sup> It is forbidden to cause a Gentile to mention the name of an idol, as it is said, &#x201C;It shall not be heard by your mouth,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1095">11</xref></sup> that is, it should not be heard because of you. However, if a Gentile is obligated to you to take an oath (as in a law suit), some Poskim are lenient and permit him to swear [by his idol.]<sup><xref rid="fn1096">12</xref></sup> The names of their holidays, which are named after people, may be mentioned without reservation; this is provided you do not refer to them in the same way the Gentiles do, in a manner indicative of respect.</p>
<p>13) All kinds of mockery are forbidden, except mockery of idols which is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn1097">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>14) It is forbidden to give a gift to a Gentile that is not your acquaintance,<sup><xref rid="fn1098">14</xref></sup> as it is written, &#x201C;You shall not show them grace;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1099">15</xref></sup> and this is explained, &#x201C;You shall not give them a free gift.&#x201D; But, if he is an acquaintance, it is not considered a free gift, for in time he will return this favor, or he has already compensated for it, and it is like a sale (and not a gift).</p>
<p>15) It is forbidden to praise them, even as much as to say, &#x201C;How handsome that Gentile is,&#x201D; and certainly you are not to speak in praise of his deeds, or to cherish any of his utterances, for this is also included [in the negative command] &#x201C;You shall not show them grace,&#x201D; that is, do not ascribe any grace to them. But if your intention by praising him, is to give thanks to the Holy One, Blessed be He, for having created such a handsome being, it is permissible.</p>
<p>16) It is permitted to help their poor, visit their sick, bury their dead, eulogize them, and console their mourners, for the purpose of maintaining peaceful relations with them.</p>
<p>17) A Jew should not be alone with a Gentile, because they are suspect to commit homicide.</p>
<p>18) A non-Jewess must not be allowed to nurse a Jewish child in her own house, even in the presence of others. But in the house of a Jew, she is permitted to nurse him when others are present, [or at least if they are] going in and out, provided that they do not leave him alone with her at night.</p>
<p>19) A Jewess should not act as midwife for a non-Jewess, unless she is known to be a [professional] midwife, for then it is permitted (so as not to incur hated). This too is permitted only if she is compensated and only on a weekday. A Jewess should not nurse a non-Jewish child, even if she is compensated. If she is engorged with milk and it is causing her discomfort; she is permitted to nurse him.</p>
<p>20) It is forbidden to teach a trade to a Gentile.</p>

<ftnote id="fn1086">2. This is only true if they can buy it from a non-Jew, but if they can only buy it from a Jew, you may not sell it to them. Also you may not sell to them for less money than the competition.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 168 Images That are Forbidden</title>
<p>1) It is written: &#x201C;You shall not make with Me gods of silver.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1100">1</xref></sup> Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, received by tradition<sup><xref rid="fn1101">2</xref></sup> that this verse is a command not to draw pictures of objects of the heavens above or the spheres below. You shall not make anything resembling My &#x201C;attendants&#x201D; that minister before Me. Therefore, it is forbidden to draw a picture of the &#x201C;four faces&#x201D; on the Chariot,<sup><xref rid="fn1102">3</xref></sup> the images of the <italic>Seraphim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1103">4</xref></sup> <italic>Ophanim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1103">4</xref></sup> and the ministering angels. It is also forbidden to draw pictures of the sun, the moon, and the stars. Even if they are not in relief, it is forbidden to make them,<sup><xref rid="fn1104">5</xref></sup> even when made for a non-Jew. However, it is permissible to keep them in your house, if they are not in relief. You must not tell a non-Jew to make them, because telling a non-Jew (to do a prohibited act) is forbidden in regard to all prohibited acts, as it is pertaining to acts prohibited on Shabbos.</p>
<p>2) It is also forbidden to sculpture the image of a person. It is prohibited to sculpture even the face of a person, and it is even forbidden to keep it in your house, unless you disfigure it to some extent. However, only a full face is forbidden,<sup><xref rid="fn1105">6</xref></sup> that is, when it has two eyes and a complete nose,<sup><xref rid="fn1106">7</xref></sup> but if it is only half a face, a profile, like some artists who form one side of the (picture) face, it is not forbidden.</p>
<p>3) If a ring has a seal on it, consisting of a person&#x2019;s image, and the image was made in relief, you are forbidden to keep it; but it is permissible to seal with it because then the signature becomes depressed. If the image on the ring is depressed, you may keep the ring, but you are forbidden to seal with it, because it comes out in relief.</p>
<p>4) It is forbidden to gaze at the image of a person, for it is called a <italic>pessel</italic> (idol), and this is in violation of the Scripture, &#x201C;Do not turn to idols.&#x201D; However, with regard to the images on coins, since everyone is accustomed to them, it is permitted. A very pious person is even careful about this.<sup><xref rid="fn1107">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>5) It is forbidden to make a house modeled after the sanctuary of the Bais HaMikdosh, having the same length, height, and width, or a vestibule modeled after the <italic>ulam</italic> in the Bais HaMikdosh or a court modeled after the <italic>azarah</italic> in the Bais HaMikdosh or a table modeled after the Table that was in the Bais HaMikdosh, nor a candelabra modeled after the <italic>menorah</italic> that was in the Bais HaMikdosh. But you may make one with five stems, or of six or eight (stems), but not of seven stems, even if it is made of metals other than gold,<sup><xref rid="fn1108">9</xref></sup> and even without cups, knobs, and flowers, and even if it is not eighteen <italic>tefachim</italic> high, because all these things were not essential even in the Bais HaMikdosh <italic>Menorah</italic>.</p>
<p>6) Some are accustomed to make a seven-branched candelabra by shaping six in a circle and one in the middle. But many <italic>Poskim</italic> forbid this, and the stricter opinion should be followed when there is doubt regarding a Scriptural prohibition.</p>
<p>7) Anyone who prepares anointment oil with the same formula and weight as prescribed in the Torah, is liable to the penalty of excisement. If he did it unknowingly, he is liable for a sin-offering, providing he had prepared it with the intention to anoint himself with it. Anyone who prepares incense with the eleven ingredients prescribed in the Torah, and in the same proportion, even if he prepared only one-half, or one-third of that quantity, is liable to the penalty of <italic>karess</italic> (excisement). If he prepared it for the purpose of making a study of it, he is guiltless.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 169 The Prohibition of Tatooing, and Making Gashes of Mourning</title>
<p>1) It is written in the Torah, &#x201C;You shall not imprint marks upon yourself.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1109">1</xref></sup> What is meant by &#x201C;imprint marks&#x201D;? A mark which is absorbed and sunken into the skin, so that it can never be erased. He who makes an incision in his skin and fills the incision with stirium, or ink, or other dyes that leave a mark; likewise, if he first dyes (the skin), and then makes an incision on the dyed area, is guilty of transgressing a negative command. Nevertheless, it is permitted to put ashes and other things on a wound for medical purposes, even if a mark will remain; for (in such cases) the wound will also leave a mark, and it will be apparent that you did not do it for the purpose of tattooing.</p>
<p>2) It is written; &#x201C;You shall not cut into your flesh for the dead.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1110">2</xref></sup> It is also written: &#x201C;You shall not cut yourselves nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1111">3</xref></sup> <italic>Gedidah</italic> and <italic>seritah</italic> [the Hebrew terms used in the Scriptural text respectively] are one and the same, and are forbidden whether in the presence of the dead, or not in the presence of the dead. Even to strike your hand onto your flesh so that blood comes out is forbidden. And to do this even for any other kind of grief is also forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn1112">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) &#x201C;Baldness&#x201D; refers to plucking out hair of the head in mourning for the dead. Even the plucking out of a single hair is forbidden. Women, are included in the prohibition of making baldness, and certainly in the prohibition of cutting.</p>

<title>Chapter 170 The Prohibition of Shaving the Hair of the Temples and Beard</title>
<p>1) There are two &#x201C;corners&#x201D; of the head,<sup><xref rid="fn1113">1</xref></sup> located at the base of the (sides of) the head, at the juncture of the temple and the cheek, on both right and left sides near the ears. Even shaving [cutting these corners] with a scissors close to the skin as with a razor, so that nothing remains of the hair close to the skin, is forbidden according to some <italic>Poskim</italic>. Therefore, if it is necessary to shave them for medical reasons, you should be careful not to shave close to the skin. The area of the corners that are forbidden to shave includes the hair from the top of the forehead to below the ear, at the point where the bottom jaw widens and spreads outward.</p>
<p>2) The Torah forbids shaving the corners of the beard,<sup><xref rid="fn1114">2</xref></sup> only when done with a razor. The beard has five &#x201C;corners&#x201D; and there are many opinions as to what they are. Therefore, a God-fearing Jew, should not use a razor on any part of the beard, even on his upper lip or under the chin. There is no difference between a razor and a sharp stone which cuts the hair, such as pigment or pumice stone, which are also forbidden. Those who remove their beard by means of a cream prepared from lime and avirem, should be careful not to scrape off the cream with a knife, which might cut the hair; but they should scrape it with a strip of wood or something similar.</p>

<title>Chapter 171 Things that are Forbidden Because A Man Should Not Wear a Woman&#x2019;s Garb</title>
<p>1) A man is forbidden to wear even one garment worn by women, even though he can be recognized as a male by his other garments.<sup><xref rid="fn1115">1</xref></sup> Likewise a woman is forbidden to wear even one garment worn by men. Not only are feminine garments forbidden to men, but also every ornament and all toiletries and cosmetics that are used exclusively by women, of that region, are forbidden to a man for purposes of adornment or enhancement. Likewise, everything used exclusively by men, is forbidden for use by a woman.</p>
<p>2) A man is forbidden to remove the hair from his armpits and the genital area, even with a pair of scissors when it is cut close to the skin, if it appears that it was done with a razor, for this is the custom of women. It is forbidden to rub the hairs of the armpits or of the genital area with the hands, so that they should fall out, but it is permitted when done with a garment. One who has scabs in his armpits, or in the genital area, and the hair causes him discomfort, is allowed to remove them.</p>
<p>3) A man is forbidden to pick even one white hair from among the black ones, for this is the way women beautify themselves, and is forbidden because of the enjoinder that &#x201C;A man shall not wear (a woman&#x2019;s garment).&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1116">2</xref></sup> It is also forbidden to dye even one white hair to make it black. A man is also forbidden to look into a mirror. However, if you look into it for medical purposes, or when you are cutting your own hair, or wish to remove stains from your face, or remove feathers from your head, it is permitted (to use a mirror). In a region where it is customary for men, to look into mirrors, it is permissible for any reason.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1115">1. <italic>Ramah</italic> (<italic>Orach Chaim</italic> 696:8) says that it is customary to dress in this way on Purim for merry making. <italic>Mishna Berurah</italic> 596:30&#x2014;<italic>Be&#x2019;er Hagolah</italic>&#x2014;<italic>Taz</italic>&#x2014;<italic>Bach</italic> say that this custom should be abolished.</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 172 Laws Concerning New Crops</title>
<p>1) It is written:<sup><xref rid="fn1117">1</xref></sup> &#x201C;And bread, and roasted grain and fresh grain<sup><xref rid="fn1118">2</xref></sup> you shall not eat until this very day&#x201D; etc. This means that it is forbidden to eat of any of the five species [of grain] [wheat, barley, oats, spelt, rye] from the new grain crop until after the offering of the <italic>omer</italic>, which was offered on the sixteenth day of <italic>Nissan</italic>. In a time when there is no <italic>omer</italic> [as in our times], it is forbidden to eat the new crop the entire day. In countries outside <italic>Eretz Yisroel</italic>, where two days of Yom Tov are celebrated, because of the doubt (of the actual day of Yom Tov,) it is also forbidden the entire seventeenth day until the beginning of the night of the eighteenth day. Grain which had been sown and taken root before the sixteenth day of <italic>Nissan</italic>, is made valid for use by (bringing) the <italic>omer</italic>, and it may be eaten immediately after it is harvested. However, if it did not take root before the sixteenth of <italic>Nissan</italic>, it is forbidden until next year&#x2019;s <italic>omer</italic> is brought.</p>
<p>2) According to most of the greatest <italic>Poskim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1119">3</xref></sup> the above prohibition, even outside <italic>Eretz Yisroel</italic>, is a Scriptural prohibition. Therefore we must pay careful attention to grain crops that are sometimes sown after <italic>Pesach</italic> or so close to <italic>Pesach</italic> that it has not taken root before the sixteenth of <italic>Nissan</italic>, such as barley and oats, and in some places also wheat, for they are forbidden until after the seventeenth of <italic>Nissan</italic> of the next year. (If it had taken root on the sixteenth day of <italic>Nissan</italic>, it is permitted at the beginning of the seventeenth night of <italic>Nissan</italic> of the next year in any event.) Also the beer<sup><xref rid="fn1120">4</xref></sup> made from this grain, is forbidden until after the next Pesach. Also the lees are forbidden. If dough was leavened with it, even if the dough was made from the old grain crops, the entire dough is forbidden due to the yeast. Concerning crops about which there is a doubt whether it is old or new, you should consult a <italic>Poseik</italic>.</p>
<p>3) Some <italic>Poskim</italic> maintain that the prohibition of eating the new crops applies only to grain that grew in the field of a Jew. Even if the field belongs to a non-Jew, but it has been leased by a Jew, the law of new crops applies to this grain. However, if the grain grew in the field of a non-Jew, the prohibition of new crops does not apply. Many people rely on this in difficult circumstances.<sup><xref rid="fn1121">5</xref></sup> Nevertheless, if the grain grew in the field of a Jew, it is not permitted at all. Most <italic>Poskim</italic> disagree, and maintain that even grain that grew in the field of a non-Jew is subject to the prohibition of new crops; and a blessing will come upon one who is strict about it.<sup><xref rid="fn1122">6</xref></sup></p>

The <italic>Trumas Hadeshen</italic> says grain of a non-Jew&#x2019;s fields outside <italic>Eretz Yisroel</italic> is &#x201C;<italic>chodosh</italic>&#x201D; only as a Rabbinical injunction and <italic>Bach-Riva</italic> permit it entirely. Anyone who can, should be strict with regard to &#x201C;<italic>chodosh</italic>&#x201D; outside <italic>Eretz Yisroel</italic>, as most <italic>poskim</italic> hold it is <italic>de&#x2019;oraisa</italic>, and certainly if you know it is &#x201C;<italic>chodosh</italic>,&#x201D; you should not eat it, since, even most of those who say it is not a <italic>de&#x2019;oraisa</italic>, say it is a Rabbinical injunction (<italic>Biur Halacha</italic> 489:10)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 173 Law of Orlah (Fruits of the First Three Years)</title>
<p>1) It is forbidden to derive benefit from the fruit of a fruit tree, whether of a Jew or of a non-Jew, even if they grow in a flower pot<sup><xref rid="fn1123">1</xref></sup> without a hole on the bottom, until after three years from its planting. It is also forbidden to derive benefit from their pits and skins. These three years are not reckoned from day (of planting) to day. Rather if you planted a tree before the sixteenth day of the month of <italic>Av</italic>, since there are still forty-four days to <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, they are counted as one year, because it takes fourteen days for it to take root, and thereafter, the thirty remaining days of the year are counted as a full year. We then count two more years from the month of <italic>Tishrei</italic> (from <italic>Rosh Hashana</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1124">2</xref></sup> But if the tree was planted after the sixteenth of <italic>Av</italic>, that part of the year is not counted at all, and you must count three years from <italic>Tishrei</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1125">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) The fruit of the fourth year&#x2019;s growth are called <italic>neta revai</italic> (growth of the fourth year) and must be redeemed. How does one redeem them? You pick them after they are fully ripe, and take a silver coin or produce that is permitted to eat, to the value of a <italic>perutah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1126">4</xref></sup> and say: &#x201C;With this I redeem these fruits of the fourth year.&#x201D; You then take the coin or the produce, destroy it and throw it into a river. You do not recite a berachah on the redemption of <italic>neta revai</italic> that grew outside of <italic>Eretz Yisroel</italic>.</p>
<p>3) Whether you have planted a seed, or a branch or transplanted a tree you must consider the fruit as <italic>orlah</italic>. However, if you graft a branch upon a tree, or if you are <italic>mavrich</italic>, which means making a hole in the ground, and bending one of the branches of the tree, and inserting the middle of the branch in the ground, leaving the end protrude above the ground; even if it was (later) cut off from the trunk of the tree; in lands outside <italic>Eretz Yisroel</italic>, the laws of <italic>orlah</italic> do not apply.</p>
<p>4) If a tree was cut down, and one <italic>tefach</italic> of stump remains above the ground, then whatever grew out of that stump is not subject to the laws of <italic>orlah</italic>. But if the stump is less than a <italic>tefach</italic> high, whatever grows out is subject to the law of <italic>orlah</italic>, and we count its years from the time the tree was cut down. If a tree was uprooted and some of its roots remained attached to the ground, even if they are as thin as a needle used for stretching the garment after weaving, it is a fact that it can sustain itself without additional earth, and its fruit is not subject to the law of <italic>orlah</italic>, even if you added much more dirt.</p>

<title>Chapter 174 The Laws of Tree Grafting</title>
<p>1) The prohibition against the grafting of diverse tree species is implied in the verse: &#x201C;You shall not sow your field with diverse seeds.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1127">1</xref></sup> Therefore it is forbidden to graft a branch of one kind of tree upon another,<sup><xref rid="fn1128">2</xref></sup> such as the branch of an apple tree upon a citron tree,<sup><xref rid="fn1129">3</xref></sup> or a branch of citron upon an apple tree. Even between similar species, like a branch of a [cultivated] apple tree upon a wild apple tree,<sup><xref rid="fn1130">4</xref></sup> since they are two varieties of apples,<sup><xref rid="fn1131">5</xref></sup> they are forbidden to be grafted with one another.<sup><xref rid="fn1132">6</xref></sup> A Jew is forbidden to allow a non-Jew to graft two diverse kinds of trees for him.</p>
<p>2) It is forbidden to maintain a tree upon which another kind has been grafted, but it is permitted to eat its fruit. It is permitted to take a branch of a grafted tree and plant it elsewhere.</p>
<p>3) Sowing a vineyard with two kinds of seeds, or sowing a field with two kinds of seeds, is not prohibited outside of <italic>Eretz Yisroel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1133">7</xref></sup> unless you have sown two kinds of grain or two kinds of vegetables together with the seeds of the vineyard.</p>

<ftnote id="fn1129">3. <italic>Ramah</italic> 295:6 (and <italic>Shach</italic> 295:3) permit the grafting of a fruitless tree onto a different kind of a fruitless tree. <italic>Chasam Sofer</italic> Responsa 288 says it is best to refrain from this as well. However, you may not graft a fruit tree with a fruitless tree. (<italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 295:3)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1130">4. <italic>Levushei Sarad</italic> Chapter 106 says these are different species because their taste is very different. However, the <italic>Mishkanos Yaakov</italic> Responsa 66 reinforces the prevailing custom that permits grafting an apple tree with a wild apple tree because they are one species and this does not depend on their taste.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1131">5. If one variety is not edible, <italic>Levushei Sarad</italic> Chapter 10 says it is considered like a fruitless tree and it is forbidden to graft it with an edible variety. <italic>Mishkanos Yaakov</italic> Responsa 66 disagrees, and considers them one species.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1132">6. <italic>Ramah</italic> 295:6 says it is best to refrain from grafting any two trees that are not exactly the same kind because not everyone is knowledgeable if they are the same species or not.</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 175 The Laws of Interbreeding Animals</title>
<p>1) It is forbidden to breed a male and female of two diverse kinds of animals, beasts or fowl. Even to merely cause cross-breeding is forbidden.</p>
<p>2) It is forbidden to do work with two diverse kinds of animals, such as ploughing with them or let them pull a wagon. Even to drive them merely by sound, such as yelling at them is forbidden, if they are harnessed together. Therefore if the cart of a non-Jew is being drawn by diverse kinds of animals, and the cargo of a Jew is on the cart, that Jew is forbidden to walk alongside the cart, for it is likely that he will yell at them, to make them go faster, which is forbidden as it constitutes driving diverse kinds of animals.</p>
<p>3) If a cart is being drawn by diverse kinds of animals, it is forbidden to sit on it even if you do not drive them.</p>
<p>4) If a wagon is being drawn by one kind of animal, you may not tie another kind of animal to the side of the cart or behind it.</p>
<p>5) It is forbidden to tie two diverse kinds of animals together even if only to prevent them from running away.<sup><xref rid="fn1134">1</xref></sup> You must be careful about this with regard to fowl, not to tie them together, as some people are in error concerning this.</p>
<p>6) A mule is bred by a horse and a donkey, and it has two species. One is bred by a stallion and a she-donkey and the other by a mare and a donkey. These mules are considered diverse kinds of beasts. Therefore, if you wish to hitch two mules together, first examine the features of their ears, tails, and voices. If these are similar, it indicates that their mothers are of the same kind and it is permitted to hitch them together. Some <italic>Poskim</italic> maintain that even a single mule is considered a mixture since it was bred from two species, and it is forbidden to do work with it or to ride on it.</p>

<title>Chapter 176 Laws Concerning Shaatnez (Wool Mixed with Linen)</title>
<p>1) [A garment made of] wool of ewes or rams, mixed with linen is forbidden, for it is <italic>kelayim</italic> (<italic>shaatnez</italic>). Whether a woolen garment was sewn to a linen garment even with silk or hemp thread, or whether a woolen garment was sewn with linen thread or vice versa, whether linen thread was tied with woolen thread or braided together, all of these are forbidden for they are <italic>shaatnez</italic>. Sewing one stitch and tying it, or sewing two stitches even without tying them is enough of a connection to make it <italic>shaatnez</italic>. Therefore, it is forbidden to join a woolen garment with a linen garment even with a needle [pin] without thread.</p>
<p>2) Sheepskins from which clothing is made, may be sewn with linen threads, and we are not concerned with the woolen hairs although they are joined with linen thread, because these woolen hairs are not considered threads and are of no use and are considered non-existent.</p>
<p>3) To join wool and linen (flax) with something between them, for example, to take a piece of leather and sew or fasten a piece of wool on one side and a piece of linen on the other side, is forbidden by Scriptural law, according to the <italic>Rambam</italic>; but some <italic>Poskim</italic> permit it.<sup><xref rid="fn1135">1</xref></sup> Therefore, according to the latter opinion, skins sewed together with linen threads may be used as a lining for a woolen garment. (And though it is possible that the hemp thread, with which the skins are sewn to line the woolen garment, will penetrate among the flax threads with which the skin were sewn, we are not concerned about it). And this is the prevailing custom.<sup><xref rid="fn1136">2</xref></sup> Nevertheless, one who is spiritially sensitive, should be strict and heed the opinion of the <italic>Rambam</italic>.</p>
<p>4) Even if ten mats [lie] one on top of the other, and the bottom one is <italic>shaatnez</italic>, it is forbidden to sit on the top one.<sup><xref rid="fn1137">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>5) If a large garment contains <italic>shaatnez</italic> at one end, it is forbidden to cover yourself even with the other end, even if the <italic>shaatnez</italic> part is resting on the ground.</p>
<p>6) If you sew a garment of <italic>shaatnez</italic> for a gentile, you may sew it in the regular manner, even though the garment rests upon your knees, provided you do not have intention to derive pleasure from its resting on you. Also clothing dealers, who carry [coats] on their shoulders to sell them, are permitted (to carry them) provided they do not intend to use them for protection from the cold or the rain. Nevertheless, God-fearing people carry them on a stick.<sup><xref rid="fn1138">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>7) Handkerchiefs, and bath towels, tablecloths and similar things, also the cover of the lectern in the synagogue on which the Torah is read, are subject to the law of <italic>shaatnez</italic>. It is also forbidden to have curtains containing <italic>shaatnez</italic>, but the curtain covering the Holy Ark may be made of <italic>shaatnez</italic>.</p>
<p>8) It is permitted to ride in covered wagons, (coaches) which are upholstered on the inside, with woolen cloth containing <italic>shaatnez</italic>, providing you are careful not to lean on the sides that contain <italic>shaatnez</italic>. You must be especially careful not to sit on cushions containing <italic>shaatnez</italic>. Some <italic>Poskim</italic> even permit to sit on such cushions, since they are made in such a way that they do not bend over the sides of the person.</p>

<ftnote id="fn1138">4. If there is a doubt whether the garment contains <italic>Shaatnez</italic>, it is nevertheless permitted to try it on for size etc. If it definitely has <italic>Shaatnez</italic>, you must consult a Rav.</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 177 The Firstborn of Clean Animals</title>
<p>1) If a Jew&#x2019;s, clean [kosher] animal gives birth to a firstborn,<sup><xref rid="fn1139">1</xref></sup> it is a mitzvah (for the owner) to sanctify it and say &#x201C;This is holy;&#x201D; for it is said, &#x201C;You shall sanctify it to Adonoy, your God.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1140">2</xref></sup> If he did not sanctify it, it is holy on its own accord from the womb, and it must be given to the <italic>kohein</italic> regardless if it is perfect, or if it received a defect after its birth, or even if it was born with a defect. However, it should not be given to the <italic>kohein</italic> when it is very young, because this does not do honor to the <italic>kohein</italic>. The owner should raise it until it is somewhat grown up, that is thirty days for a small animal (sheep or goat), and fifty days for a large animal (cow). If a <italic>kohein</italic> cannot be found, the owner must care for it until a <italic>kohein</italic> comes along.</p>
<p>2) If, within this time the <italic>kohein</italic> said to the owner: &#x201C;Give it to me and I will raise it,&#x201D; if it does not have a defect, he is not permitted to give it to him, because this would appear as if the <italic>kohein</italic> is doing the Yisroel (owner) a favor (that he is tending it for him) in consideration of his giving the animal to him. And this is forbidden, for it is tantamount to robbing the other <italic>kohanim</italic>. However, if the animal was blemished during this time, and the <italic>kohein</italic> said to the owner, &#x201C;Give it to me so that I may eat it,&#x201D; it is permitted to give it to him since he may slaughter it immediately.</p>
<p>3) At present if the <italic>kohein</italic> does not want to accept the animal, because it is too bothersome to raise it until it is blemished, he is not allowed to refuse it because it looks as though he is showing contempt for the priestly gifts. Nevertheless, the Yisroel is forbidden to give it to the <italic>kohein</italic> in order to vex him or to take revenge on him. If he does so with this intention, the <italic>kohein</italic> need not accept it. Similarly, if the Yisroel was negligent in that he was able to sell the animal to a Gentile before it gave birth and he did not sell it, the <italic>kohein</italic> need not accept that firstborn; rather the owner himself must raise it until it becomes blemished, and then give it to the <italic>kohein</italic>.</p>
<p>4) In our times, the firstborn must be kept until it is blemished, and upon receiving the blemish, it must be shown to three Torah scholars one of whom must be an expert, to know if it is a permanent blemish, and, if it is, they permit its use. Afterwards it is slaughtered and if found to be kosher, it may be eaten even by a Yisroel ([and certainly by a <italic>kohein</italic>]). However, it should not be sold in the meat market, or weighed out by the pound and no part of it may be given to the dogs, and you may not sell, or give, any part of it to a Gentile.</p>
<p>5) When a firstborn sustains a blemish, and there are men in the area who are competent to rule that it is permitted, it should be shown to them immediately. Once it has been permitted, it should not be kept a long time. If it was permitted during its first year, it may be kept until it is a year old. If it was permitted near the end of its first year, or after its first year, it should not be kept for longer than thirty days. If the owner transgressed and kept it longer, it is not disqualified because of this.</p>
<p>6) The <italic>kohein</italic> must raise the firstborn until it sustains a blemish. He may sell it to a Yisroel whether it has a blemish or whether it does not have a blemish, providing the Yisroel treats it in a manner befitting the holiness of a firstborn, and is also not buying it for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>7) It is not permitted to be <italic>margil</italic> the firstborn.<sup><xref rid="fn1141">3</xref></sup> This means it must not be skinned in one piece, from its feet upward, for it would appear disgraceful to skin the sacred [animal], with the intention of making bellows of it (the skin).</p>
<p>8) If the firstborn is slaughtered and found to be a <italic>treifa</italic>, <sup><xref rid="fn1142">4</xref></sup> it is forbidden to benefit from its hide and its meat, and it must be buried. Similarly, if it dies a natural death it must be buried. It is customary to wrap it in a sheet, and bury it deep in the ground of the cemetery.</p>
<p>9) It is forbidden to fleece or to do work with the first born regardless if it is blemished or not. Even if some wool came off by itself, no benefit may ever be derived from that wool. However, the wool that is on its body, when slaughtered after receiving a blemish, is permitted for the slaughtering permits the wool for use just as it permits the use of the meat and the hide.</p>
<p>10) The firstborn is not permitted to be eaten unless it sustains a blemish. It is forbidden to close it up in a vault so that it should die of its own, for this would be destroying a sacred thing.</p>
<p>11) It is forbidden to make a blemish in a firstborn, or even to cause a blemish indirectly; for example, to put dough on its ear, in order for a dog to grab it and bite off its ear with it; or to cause a blemish in some similar way. It is forbidden to tell a Gentile to make a blemish in a firstborn, but it is permitted to give it to a Gentile to raise it or watch it.</p>
<p>12) If an animal is purchased from a Gentile, and it is not known if it has given birth before or not, and now it has given birth while in the possession of the Jew, its status as a firstborn is doubtful, and even if the Gentile innocently volunteers the information that it had previously given birth, it is of no avail. Even the characteristic signs in the cracks of its horns are of no avail. And even if she was being milked, it is of no avail, unless we see her nursing a calf. If she is being milked, and the Gentile innocently volunteers, (not for the purpose of promoting the sale,) and states that she has previously given birth, these two things together are proof with regards to cows, but not with regards to goats.<sup><xref rid="fn1143">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>13) <italic>Kohanim</italic> and Levites are also subject to the laws regarding the firstborn of clean animals, except that the <italic>kohein</italic> sets it aside, and keeps it for himself and maintains it in the state of holiness that is due a firstborn.<sup><xref rid="fn1144">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>14) If a Gentile and a Jew are partners in an animal, or a Jew agrees to raise an animal of a Gentile, and share equally in the offspring, they are exempt from the laws of the firstborn for it is said: &#x201C;Whatever opens the womb among the Children of Yisrael,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1145">7</xref></sup> meaning, all of it must belong to a Jew. If a Gentile agrees to raise an animal of a Jew, and share equally in the offspring, according to many <italic>Poskim</italic> it is of no avail, but the Jew must sell the mother to the Gentile.</p>
<p>15) It is a mitzvah to sell to a Gentile the clean animal (before it gives birth), or to form a partnership with him before it gives birth, in order to exempt it from the laws of the firstborn.<sup><xref rid="fn1146">8</xref></sup> And although (by doing this), it circumvents the holiness of the firstborn, it is, nevertheless, preferable so that no violations will be committed with regard to its wool and its use for work. Transferring the title (of the calf) to the Gentile when the calf is yet unborn is of no avail, since it is something that has not come into existence;<sup><xref rid="fn1147">9</xref></sup> but the title of the mother must be transferred as well. The transfer of the title should be done in this manner: the owner should come to terms with the Gentile regarding the price of the cow, and also rent him the place that the cow now occupies; the Gentile should give him a <italic>perutah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1148">10</xref></sup> and the Jew should say to him, &#x201C;With this <italic>perutah</italic> you shall acquire the place that the cow now occupies, and this place will acquire the title of the cow for you.<sup><xref rid="fn1149">11</xref></sup> It can also be done in this manner: after they come to terms about the price of the cow, the Gentile should give him a <italic>perutah</italic>, and then lead the cow into his own premises, or into an alleyway, whereby he acquires title both by <italic>meshicha</italic> (actual transfer) and with money. Even if he returns the cow afterwards to the premises of the Jew it does not matter.</p>

<title>Chapter 178 The Firstborn of a Donkey</title>
<p>1) If a Jew has a female-donkey that gives birth to a firstborn male, it is a mitzvah to redeem it. With what do you redeem it? With the young of sheep or goats whether male or female, whether large or small, whether perfect or blemished; provided it is not a <italic>treifa</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1150">1</xref></sup> it is not slaughtered, and is not a <italic>ben pekuah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1151">2</xref></sup> This lamb must then be given to the <italic>kohein</italic>. From when are you obliged to redeem it? At anytime from the day it was born until it dies. However, it is a mitzvah to redeem it immediately, in order not to delay the performance of the mitzvah. After it has been redeemed it remains in the owner&#x2019;s possession, and is no longer considered sacred. Also the lamb in the possession of the <italic>kohein</italic> is not considered sacred.</p>
<p>2) Immediately, upon setting aside the lamb to be exchanged for the firstborn donkey, the firstborn donkey is considered a secular item even before the lamb is given to the <italic>kohein</italic>. Therefore, as soon as the lamb is set aside, this <italic>berachah</italic> is recited: <italic>Asher kidishanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu al pidyon petter chamor</italic> &#x201C;Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and has commanded us concerning redemption of the firstborn donkey.&#x201D;</p>
<p>3) Before it is redeemed, it is forbidden to have any benefit from it, even if it was already given to the <italic>kohein</italic>. Even the <italic>kohein</italic> is forbidden to use it until it is redeemed and has taken the lamb for himself. If it died before it was redeemed, it must be buried</p>
<p>4) If the owner chooses not to redeem it, he strikes it with a hatchet on the back of its head, until it dies, and then buries it, as it is forbidden for use. The mitzvah of redemption takes preference over the mitzvah of breaking its neck.</p>
<p>5) <italic>Kohanim</italic> and Levites are exempt from the mitzvah of redeeming the firstborn of their donkeys. The daughter of a <italic>kohein</italic> or Levi are also exempt, but their husbands are obligated to redeem the firstborn of their donkeys. Partnerships with a <italic>kohein</italic> or a Levite, and also partnership with a Gentile, are exempt from the mitzvah; but it is forbidden to form a partnership with them, or to sell it to them in order to nullify its sacredness, since this may be achieved through redemption or by breaking its neck.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1150">1. See Chapter 177, footnote 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1151">2. When a cow carries an unborn calf, the slaughter of the cow is considered the slaughter of the calf as well, and thus the calf, although alive, does not require further slaughtering. This type of calf is called a <italic>ben pekuah</italic>.</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 179 Laws Concerning Loans</title>
<p>1) It is a mitzvah to lend money to Jews who are in need, as it is said, &#x201C;If you lend money to My people, to the poor amongst you,&#x201D; etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1152">1</xref></sup> Although it is written &#x201C;if&#x201D;, our Sages of blessed memory, received the tradition that this &#x201C;if&#x201D; is not an option, but an obligation. The <italic>Mechilta</italic> states that the verse, &#x201C;If you lend money to my people,&#x201D; denotes an obligation. Why do you say it is an obligation? Perhaps it is really optional (since it states &#x201C;if&#x201D;)? Because we can infer from the verse, &#x201C;And you shall surely lend him,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1153">2</xref></sup> that it is obligatory and not optional. The word &#x201C;if&#x201D; written here means, when you lend money, you should lend it to <italic>My</italic> people, and not to heathens. And to whom of My people? To him that is with you. From this they inferred that your poor relatives take precedence over other poor people, and the poor of your city take precedence over the poor of other cities.<sup><xref rid="fn1154">3</xref></sup> The <italic>mitzvah</italic> of lending money to a poor person is greater than giving charity to a poor beggar,<sup><xref rid="fn1155">4</xref></sup> for the latter has already been reduced to begging, while the former has not yet reached this stage. The Torah is provoked with one who refuses to lend money to the poor, as it is said, &#x201C;And your eye be evil against your needy brother&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1156">5</xref></sup> etc. Concerning the one who lends to the needy in time of his distress, the Scripture says, &#x201C;Then you shall call and God will answer.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1157">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) Even if a rich man needs to borrow money, it is a <italic>mitzvah</italic> to lend it to him, and to cheer him with kind words, and to give him proper advice.</p>
<p>3) It is forbidden to lend money without witnesses,<sup><xref rid="fn1158">7</xref></sup> not even to a Torah scholar,<sup><xref rid="fn1159">8</xref></sup> unless you are lending against a security. To lend money with legal documentation is the best course to take.</p>
<p>4) It is forbidden to demand payment from the borrower, when you know that he is unable to pay. It is forbidden even to appear before him, for he may be ashamed to see the lender, at a time when he is unable to repay the loan.<sup><xref rid="fn1160">9</xref></sup> Concerning this it is said, &#x201C;You shall not be unto him like a creditor.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1161">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>5) Just as the lender is forbidden to demand payment from the borrower, so, too, is the borrower forbidden to withhold his friend&#x2019;s money, and tell him, &#x201C;Go away and return later,&#x201D; when he actually has the money; as it is said, &#x201C;Do not tell your friend, &#x201C;Go away and return later.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1162">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) A borrower is forbidden to take the loan, and spend it unnecessarily, and possibly lose it, and thus the lender will be unable to collect it. This applies even if the lender is very wealthy. One who does this is called a wicked person, as it is said, &#x201C;The wicked borrow and do not repay.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1163">12</xref></sup> The Sages have commanded: &#x201C;Your friend&#x2019;s property should be as dear to you as your own.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1164">13</xref></sup> If the lender recognizes that the borrower has this character, that he has no consideration for other people&#x2019;s property, it is better not to lend him, than to lend him and be compelled to press him later, thereby violating on each occasion the precept, &#x201C;You shall not be to him like a creditor.&#x201D;</p>
<p>7) If you lend money on a security, you must refrain from using the security, for this is like taking interest. If you lend a poor man money on [the security of] a shovel, or on an axe, or a similar thing, which can be rented out at a good fee, and is only slightly depreciated by use, you may rent it out without obtaining the owner&#x2019;s permission, and deduct the proceeds from the debt, as it may be assumed that the borrower would agree to it. Some <italic>Poskim</italic> say you may rent out these articles only to others, but not to yourself,<sup><xref rid="fn1165">14</xref></sup> lest you be suspected of using them free of charge merely because of the loan.</p>
<p>8) If the lender wants to take a security from the borrower, after the loan had been made, he should not do so by himself,<sup><xref rid="fn1166">15</xref></sup> but rather through <italic>Beis Din</italic>.</p>
<p>9) You should avoid becoming a guarantor, or a trustee whenever possible.<sup><xref rid="fn1167">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>10) If you hold a note of indebtedness against your friend, and the document is worn out, and its script is fading<sup><xref rid="fn1168">17</xref></sup> you should go to a <italic>Beis Din</italic> and have it certified.</p>
<p>11) It is forbidden to keep a paid note in your possession, for it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn1169">18</xref></sup> &#x201C;Do not let unrighteousness dwell in your tents.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1170">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>12) Just as you must be careful to guard a deposited article, you must be careful to guard the security even more so; because you are like a paid watchman<sup><xref rid="fn1171">20</xref></sup> of the article. And just as a trustee is not permitted to give the article to another person to watch, as will be explained in chapter 188, so is the lender not permitted to deposit the security with someone else, or to give it as a security without the consent of the owner.</p>
<p>13) If you lend money to your friend on a security on condition that if he does not repay the loan at a certain date, he will forfeit the security, then you must be sure to tell the borrower when the loan is made, &#x201C;If you do not redeem the security by such and such a date, it shall become mine retroactive to the present time.&#x201D;</p>
<p>14) If you know you owe your friend money, and your friend says to you: &#x201C;I am certain you owe me nothing,&#x201D; you need not pay him, because he has apparently forgiven the debt.<sup><xref rid="fn1172">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>15) When a borrower chooses to repay the lender via a messenger, as soon as he gives the money to the messenger, the messenger acquires the money for the lender. Thereafter, if the borrower has regrets, and wishes to take back the money from the messenger, and repay the loan later, he is forbidden to do so; because this is borrowing without the owner&#x2019;s knowledge. The messenger is equally forbidden to return the money to the borrower.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 180 Cancellation of Debts in the Sabbatical Year</title>
<p>1) Most <italic>Poskim</italic> [<italic>halachic</italic> authorities] agree that the cancellation of debts on the <italic>shemitah</italic> year, is effective even in our time,<sup><xref rid="fn1173">1</xref></sup> and even in lands outside <italic>Eretz Yisroel</italic>. The general public is lenient about this, and have been censured on this account by the great Torah scholars of Yisrael, of blessed memory. A few of them have tried to justify this [lax] custom by relying on a few [authorities]<sup><xref rid="fn1174">2</xref></sup> who are lenient about this. However, a person who wishes to observe <italic>mitzvos</italic> meticulously is certainly obligated to follow the opinion of the majority of <italic>poskim</italic> of blessed memory. Particularly so, when the problem can be solved by means of the <italic>prosbol</italic>, (see paragraph 15) without any monetary loss. The last Sabbatical Year was in 5635,<sup><xref rid="fn1175">3</xref></sup> and will occur, God willing, in the year 5642.<sup><xref rid="fn1175">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) The Sabbatical Year (<italic>shemitah</italic>) cancels every type of loan, whether it is an oral loan, or on a note, or even on a property mortgage.<sup><xref rid="fn1176">4</xref></sup> If you gave your friend money, as a business partnership, (described in Chapter 66), whereby half of it is a loan and the other half is a deposit, the half that is considered a loan is cancelled, but the half that is a deposit is not cancelled.</p>
<p>3) If you lend someone on the security of a pledge [collateral], it is not cancelled<sup><xref rid="fn1177">5</xref></sup> (on <italic>shemitah</italic>); but if you lent him on the security of real estate, there are various halachic opinions regarding the cancellation of the debt.</p>
<p>4) If a guarantor paid the lender, and before the borrower had paid the guarantor, the Sabbatical Year intervened, <italic>shemitah</italic> cancels this debt.</p>
<p>5) If someone is obliged to another, [to take] an oath concerning a monetary claim, and if he were to admit his liability, the <italic>shemitah</italic> would cancel his debt, then <italic>shemitah</italic> cancels the oath as well.</p>
<p>6) If a man owes someone money and denies it, (and as a result) the claim was presented to <italic>Beis Din</italic> and he was charged, once the <italic>Beis Din</italic> recorded the verdict, and gave it to the lender, the <italic>shemitah</italic> does not cancel this debt.</p>
<p>7) If you lend money to someone on condition that <italic>shemitah</italic> will not cancel the debt, even so, <italic>shemitah</italic> cancels it. However, if a condition was made that the <italic>borrower</italic> shall not cancel this debt, even if this is during the <italic>shemitah</italic> year, it does not cancel it. Also, if the note was written with reference as a deposit, <italic>shemitah</italic> does not cancel this debt.</p>
<p>8) If you lend money to someone for a certain number of years, and the debt is due after the <italic>shemitah</italic> year, the debt is not cancelled, because you were unable to demand payment earlier.</p>
<p>9) If you present your notes of indebtedness to <italic>Beis Din</italic> and say to them: &#x201C;Collect my debts for me,&#x201D; they are not cancelled in the <italic>shemitah</italic> year.<sup><xref rid="fn1178">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>10) If you sell something to someone on credit, the money is considered a loan and <italic>shemitah</italic> cancels it. However, a storekeeper who sells to people on credit, and it is not his custom to demand payment until a certain amount accumulates,<sup><xref rid="fn1179">7</xref></sup> these debts are not cancelled. If, however, he charged them as a loan, that is, he totalled all the items, and entered the sum total in his ledger, then it is considered a loan,<sup><xref rid="fn1180">8</xref></sup> and <italic>shemitah</italic> cancels it.</p>
<p>11) The wages of a laborer are not cancelled, but if they were converted into a loan, they are cancelled by <italic>shemitah</italic>.</p>
<p>12) Claims acquired from a non-Jew are treated as claims of a non-Jew. Therefore, if you purchase a note of indebtedness from a non-Jew, against a Jew, <italic>shemitah</italic> does not cancel it, for the non-Jew was able to collect with his note under all circumstances. Also, if one has become a guarantor to a non-Jew, on behalf of a Jew, and the Jew failed to pay his debt, so that the Jewish guarantor had to pay the non-Jew, and thus took the note that the non-Jew held against the borrower, <italic>shemitah</italic> does not cancel this note. However, if there is no note, but the guarantor sues the borrower orally, because he had to pay the non-Jew for him; then the borrower is exempt from payment.<sup><xref rid="fn1181">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>13) <italic>Shemitah</italic> cancels monetary loans only at the end of the <italic>shemitah</italic> year. Therefore, if you lend someone money during the <italic>shemitah</italic> year, you may collect the debt during the entire year, but at sunset the eve of <italic>Rosh Hashana</italic>, the debt is cancelled.</p>
<p>14) If a borrower comes to pay his debt to the lender after the <italic>shemitah</italic> had passed, the lender should say to him: &#x201C;I have cancelled your debt, and you are released from my claims.&#x201D; If the borrower says: &#x201C;Even so, I want you to accept the money,&#x201D; the lender is permitted to accept it. However, the borrower should not say, &#x201C;I am paying this on the account of my debt;&#x201D; rather, he should say to him: &#x201C;The money is mine, and I am giving it to you as a gift.&#x201D; The lender is [even] permitted to make an effort to persuade the borrower to say &#x201C;I am giving you the money as a gift.&#x201D; However, if he is unable to [persuade him] he may not accept the money from him.</p>
<p>15) If there is a <italic>prosbol, shemitah</italic> does not cancel the debt. What is a <italic>prosbol</italic> and how is it obtained? The lender goes before three men, learned in Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn1182">10</xref></sup> who constitute a <italic>Beis Din</italic>. He says to them: &#x201C;To you judges, I hand over all the claims I have against so and so, etc. so that I am able to collect these debts whenever I desire.&#x201D; They then write for him a <italic>prosbol</italic> which reads: &#x201C;We were sitting together, as three [judges], and so-and-so the lender came and said in our presence, &#x201C;I hand over etc.&#x201D; All three judges sign at the bottom of the document, either as judges or as witnesses. This can also be done at the end of the year, that is, on the eve of Rosh Hashana before sunset. Some <italic>Poskim</italic> say it is not necessary to write the <italic>prosbol</italic>, but it is sufficient if he declares this before the <italic>Beis Din</italic>. Even if there is no <italic>Beis Din</italic> in your town, you can declare: &#x201C;I hand over my notes to the <italic>Beis Din</italic> which is in such and such a place.</p>
<p>16) The <italic>prosbol</italic> is of no avail unless the borrower possesses some real estate, be it ever so small; even if he has only a flower pot with a hole in the bottom, it is sufficient. Even if the borrower has none, but the guarantor has some real estate, or someone who is indebted to the borrower has some, this too is sufficient. If none of these people possess any real estate, and the lender possesses some real estate, be it ever so small, he may transfer it to the borrower, even through a third party, and even in the borrower&#x2019;s absence,<sup><xref rid="fn1183">11</xref></sup> and this is sufficient to validate the <italic>prosbol</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1173">1. Today it is a Rabbinical injunction. When the <italic>Yoveil</italic> (Jubilee Year) was observed (as in the era of the first Beis Hamikdash, and some say during the second as well), the cancellation of debts on the <italic>Shemitah</italic> year was a <italic>de&#x2019;oraisa</italic>. (see <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 67:1)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1174">2. Ba&#x2019;al Hamaor.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1175">3. As an update, the most recent one occured in the year 5754.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1176">4. <italic>Rambam, Ramban, Rashba</italic>, etc. The <italic>Maharik</italic> disagrees on this point.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1177">5. Some say only the amount equivalent to the value of the pledge is not cancelled, while others say the entire debt is not cancelled. <italic>Shulchan Aruch</italic> 67:12. The latter is the opinion of the majority of <italic>Rishonim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1178">6. The <italic>Rambam, Smag, Chinuch</italic> etc. explain that it is not you, but the <italic>Beis Din</italic>, that is claiming the debt; and that is permitted.</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 181 Laws of Litigation and Testimony</title>
<p>1) When there is a controversy between two persons, it is best for them to agree to an acceptable compromise, with each side yielding somewhat, in order to avoid the humiliation of a lawsuit. They should make every effort to do so.</p>
<p>2) If it is impossible for them to reach an acceptable compromise, and they are forced to go to court, they should go before a Jewish <italic>Beis Din</italic>. It is forbidden to bring a suit before secular judges, and in their courts; even if their decision would be in accordance with the Torah law.<sup><xref rid="fn1184">1</xref></sup> Even if both litigants are willing to bring the case before them, it is forbidden to do so. Even if they had made a binding agreement, or they had a written agreement to that effect, it is of no avail. Whoever brings a case before them is a wicked person, and it is considered as if he had insulted, blasphemed, and rebelled against the Torah of <italic>Moshe Rabbeinu</italic>, peace be on him. Even in a case where a man is permitted to take the law into his own hands, as will be explained, God willing, in paragraph 9, it is forbidden to do so through non-Jews. Even if he does not bring the case before a secular tribunal, but uses non-Jews to force his opponent to go with him to a Jewish court, he deserves to be flogged.</p>
<p>3) When the defendant is a difficult person, and you live in a society governed by non-Jews; you should first summon him to appear in <italic>Beis Din</italic>. If he refuses to go, you may obtain the consent of <italic>Beis Din</italic>, and save your property in the secular courts.</p>
<p>4) If you are sued on a monetary claim, that you really owe, it is forbidden to seek ways of evasion, in order to force the creditor to compromise, and forgo the remainder of the debt. If you transgressed and did so, you are not discharged of your obligation before the judgement of Heaven, until you pay the claimant what is rightfully his.</p>
<p>5) A litigant is forbidden to present his case to the judge in the absence of his opponent. Therefore, one litigant should not present himself to the judge before the other, lest he be suspected of coming early in order to present his case in the absence of his opponent.</p>
<p>6) Just as the judge who accepts a bribe, even to acquit the innocent, transgresses a negative precept, so does he who offers the bribe transgress the negative precept, &#x201C;You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1185">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>7) It is forbidden to enter a false plea. Even if you know you have a just claim, and if you tell the truth, the judgement will be against you, nevertheless, you may not enter a false plea. This is stated in the Talmud:<sup><xref rid="fn1186">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;Our Rabbis have taught, from where do we know that one who has lent his friend one hundred <italic>shekalim</italic>, should not say I will claim two hundred, so that when he admits to owing one hundred, he will be obliged to take an oath,<sup><xref rid="fn1187">4</xref></sup> and then I will force him to take an oath<sup><xref rid="fn1188">5</xref></sup> with regard to some other matter? We learn it from the verse: &#x201C;Keep far away from anything false.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1189">6</xref></sup> From where do we know that if one has a claim against another for one hundred <italic>shekalim</italic>, but demands two hundred <italic>shekalim</italic>, that the borrower should not say, I will deny the whole claim in <italic>Beis Din</italic>, and will admit (to one hundred) out of <italic>Beis Din</italic>, in order not to be obliged to take an oath, and to prevent him from making me take an oath as regards some other matter? We learn it from the verse: &#x201C;Keep far away from anything false.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1189">6</xref></sup> From where do we know that if three people have a claim of one hundred <italic>shekalim</italic> against one person, that one of them must not be the plaintiff and the other appear as witnesses, in order to obtain the one hundred <italic>shekalim</italic>, and divide it among themselves? We learn from the verse: &#x201C;Keep far away from anything false.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1189">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>8) Occasionally, the litigants choose men [arbitrators] to effect a compromise between them, either jointly with the <italic>Beis Din</italic>, or without <italic>Beis Din</italic>. This is a proper procedure, because each [arbitrator] promotes the cause of the one who has chosen him, and thus a just settlement will be reached. But the arbitration must be conducted in a just manner, [and not] Heaven forbid pervert the process of compromise. For just as we are commanded not to pervert judgement, so, too, we are commanded not to pervert the process of compromise.</p>
<p>9) A man may [sometimes] take the law into his own hands. If you see an article of yours in the possession of someone who had robbed it, you may take it away from him. If the latter tries to stop you, you may even strike him until he releases it, if you are unable to get it by other means. You may do so even if it is an article that will not depreciate if you wait until you summon him to <italic>Beis Din</italic>. If there are witnesses who [will] see you seize the article from this other&#x2019;s possession, you may not seize it by forceful means, unless you will be able to verify later that you took what is yours. For if you are unable to prove your ownership, your seizure is of no avail since there are witnesses that you took it by force. However, if there are no witnesses, whereby the seizure will be effective, you may seize it forcefully even though you will be unable to verify your ownership.</p>
<p>10) When the people of a city appoint a <italic>Beis Din</italic> for the community, they must ascertain that each one of the judges possesses the following seven qualities: wisdom in Torah, humility, fear of God, abhorence of money&#x2014;even their own, love of truth, loved by their fellow men, and a reputation for good deeds. Whoever appoints a judge who is unfit for the position, transgresses a negative precept, as it is said, &#x201C;You shall not respect persons in judgement.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1190">7</xref></sup> This means, you shall not favor anyone and say, &#x201C;So-and-so is wealthy, or is my relative, I will appoint him as a judge.&#x201D; It is forbidden to rise before a judge who was appointed through the influence of money, or to show him any other honor. With reference to such a person, our Rabbis, of blessed memory,<sup><xref rid="fn1191">8</xref></sup> applied the verse: &#x201C;Gods of silver and gods of gold you shall not make for yourselves.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1192">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>11) In communities where there are no scholars who are qualified to be judges, they should appoint the best and wisest among themselves according to the understanding of the townsmen, and they should judge even though they are not qualified to be judges. We permit this so that people will not go to the secular courts. Since they were accepted by their townsmen, no one can disqualify them. All their activities should be for the glory of Heaven.</p>
<p>12) If you are able to bear witness for your neighbor and are qualified to testify, and your neighbor would benefit from your testimony, and asks you to testify on his behalf in the presence of <italic>Beis Din</italic>, you are obliged to testify, whether there is another witness besides you or you are the only one. If you withhold such testimony, you will have to answer to the Heavenly Court. It is forbidden to testify about anything you do not know (firsthand), and not even if the man who told you is someone you are certain that tells no lies. Even if the litigant says to you, &#x201C;Come and stand next to the one witness that I have, not to testify, but just to intimidate my debtor, so he will think that I have two witnesses, and he will consequently admit (his obligation to me),&#x201D; you must not listen to him, as it is said, &#x201C;Keep far away from anything false.&#x201D;</p>
<p>13) The law that states that the testimony of one witness is valid, is only when money matters are involved; for then, the testimony of even one witness is sufficient to require the administration of an oath. Similarly, with regard to a sinful act, if the prohibition was not yet violated, the singular witness may testify in order to prevent him from sinning. However, if the sinful act had already been committed one witness should not testify to it; since one witness is not believed, he will only be spreading an evil report about another person.</p>
<p>14) If you accept a reward for your testimony, your testimony is null and void. This is true only after you had already witnessed the facts, for then it is your duty to testify free of charge. However, (if you are asked) to witness a certain transaction in order to subsequently testify, you are permitted to take compensation. It is permitted to take compensation only to the extent that you were inconvenienced and no more. Also, if it is an inconvenience for you to go to <italic>Beis Din</italic>, you are entitled to compensation for your inconvenience, but only to the extent that it is proper for this inconvenience, and no more.</p>
<p>15) Any testimony from which you derive benefit, or in which you have a personal interest, even if remote, disqualifies you as a witness.</p>
<p>16) It is written, &#x201C;And that which is not good, he did among his people.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1193">10</xref></sup> This is homiletically interpreted to refer to a person who comes with power of attorney, and argues about a quarrel that is not his.<sup><xref rid="fn1194">11</xref></sup> This applies only when both litigants are in town, but the borrower is a strong man, and a good pleader, and the lender fears the confrontation with him, and thus gives power of attorney to someone else. This is the case of someone arguing about a quarrel that is not his.<sup><xref rid="fn1195">12</xref></sup> However, if the defendant is in another city, and the plaintiff cannot trouble himself (to go personally), and gives someone the power of attorney, then the latter is doing a meritorious deed in rescuing the wronged person from the hand of the one exploiting him. Some <italic>Poskim</italic> maintain that if you accept a power of attorney in order to receive a fee, and not because you are a quarrelsome person, it is permitted.</p>
<p>17) You should distance yourself from taking an oath, even if it is a truthful one. You should make every effort to refrain from it.<sup><xref rid="fn1196">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>18) If your opponent is obliged to you for an oath, and you realize that he is prepared to swear falsely, Heaven forbid, you should reach the best possible compromise with him, and not permit him to swear falsely, for it is said, &#x201C;an oath to Adonoy shall be between them.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1197">14</xref></sup> And this is expounded to teach, that [the punishment of] the oath rests on both of them.<sup><xref rid="fn1198">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>19) If a Jew knows of evidence that favors a Gentile who has a lawsuit with a Jew in the secular courts, and his testimony will cause his fellow Jew to be liable for a larger amount than he would have been liable to according to Jewish law, he is forbidden to testify for him;<sup><xref rid="fn1199">16</xref></sup> but if not, he is permitted to testify for him. If initially the Gentile arranged for the Jew to testify for him, since the Name of God will be desecrated if he does not testify (as he had agreed to), he should testify under all circumstances.</p>
<p>20) So long as you remember the facts, you may testify at any time and you need not fear that because it happened long ago, you do not remember clearly. Even if you only remember the testimony from the record you made. If for example when they gave you [a document etc.] you wrote the information in your book, in order to have a record of it, and you had forgotten the facts and only remember them from your records, even in such an event you may testify. This is true only if upon reading the records, your memory is refreshed. Also, if your memory is refreshed by someone else who reminded you, you may testify; even if the one who reminded you is the second witness. However, if the litigant himself<sup><xref rid="fn1200">17</xref></sup> reminded you and refreshed your memory, you may not testify. The litigant, however, may present the facts to someone else, and that person may in turn remind you, for then your memory will have been refreshed by a third party.</p>
<p>21) A witness who is related to one of the litigants, or to one of the judges; or witnesses who are related to one another, even if the relationship is on their wives side, may sometimes be disqualified to testify. Even if they are related only to the guarantor, and not to the borrower, they are also disqualifed from testifying on behalf of the borrower. The Torah has disqualified the testimony of relatives, not because of the love they have for one another, for they are disqualified to testify whether it is in his favor or against him; but rather, it is a Divine decree. Even Moses and Aaron were not qualified to testify for one another. Therefore, any witness who is related to any one of the above mentioned individuals, or was once related, but the relationship no longer exists&#x2014;should the judges be unaware of the situation, the witness must inform them, and they will tell him if in accordance with Torah law, the relationship is significant enough to disqualify him, or not.</p>
<p>22) If there are two witnesses and one of them knows that the other is a sinful man, and is not qualified to testify according to the law of the Torah, and the judges are unaware of his wickedness, it is forbidden to testify with him, even though the testimony is true, for it is said: &#x201C;Do not join your hand with a wicked man to be a corrupt witness.<sup><xref rid="fn1201">18</xref></sup> It is a Divine decree that the entire testimony be invalidated even if there are many witnesses, should one of them be disqualified to testify. Who is considered sinful enough to be disqualified as a witness by decree of the Torah? Whoever transgresses in a matter which has been accepted by the Jewish people as a sin, and which is a Divine prohibition, that he violated intentionally and has not (been known to have) repented. However, if it is possible to assume that he did it unintentionally, or in ignorance, not being aware of the prohibition, he is not disqualified to bear testimony.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 182 Laws Concerning Theft and Robbery</title>
<p>1) It is forbidden to rob or to steal even an article of trivial value from a Jew or from a non-Jew. It is recorded in <italic>Tanna Devei Eliyohu:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1202">1</xref></sup> It happened that a man told me [Eliyah] that he had wronged a non-Jew in measuring dates that he sold to him. Thereafter, he bought oil with all that money and the jug broke and the oil spilled. I said, &#x201C;Blessed is the Omnipotent that shows no favoritism.&#x201D; The Torah says, &#x201C;Do not cheat your fellow, nor rob him,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1203">2</xref></sup> and robbery of a non-Jew also constitutes robbery.</p>
<p>2) Taking a thing of such trivial value, that no one would mind, like taking a splinter from a bundle [of wood], in order to use it as a toothpick, is permitted. However, it is an act of piousness to refrain from this as well.</p>
<p>3) Even stealing with the intention of returning it, but just for the sake of annoying someone, or to tease someone, is also forbidden.</p>
<p>4) It is forbidden to cheat your fellow even in the slightest degree, as it is said, &#x201C;Do not cheat your neighbor.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1204">3</xref></sup> What is cheating? If your neighbor&#x2019;s money comes into your possession with his consent; for example, if he lent you money, or you owe him wages (or rent), and you do not wish to pay him, or you put him off by saying, &#x201C;Go,&#x201D; &#x201C;and return [later].&#x201D; Since the verse states: your [<italic>Jewish</italic>] neighbor, it is not forbidden to do so with a non-Jew. This is true only if this will not cause the Name of God to be desecrated; for example if you borrowed from a non-Jew and he died, it is permitted to deny the loan to his son, because he does not know for sure that you are lying. However, if the non-Jew knows you are lying, it is forbidden because of the desecration of God&#x2019;s Name. And even if the son is not sure, it is only permitted to deny a loan, or any other such debt you owed him. If you have in your possession an article you received from a non-Jew which is intact, you are forbidden to deny it, for this constitutes actual robbery. Moreover, even if you buy something from a non-Jew, you are forbidden to fool him in counting out the money, as it is said, &#x201C;And he shall reckon with his buyer,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1205">4</xref></sup> which refers to a non-Jew. For he is only conveying the article to you in consideration of the sum agreed upon, and if you fool him in the payment, it is tantamount to stealing the article, and not merely denying a debt.<sup><xref rid="fn1206">5</xref></sup> Even deception not involving any loss of money is forbidden in business dealing, as was explained in Chapter 63. Nevertheless, if the non-Jew makes a mistake, it is permitted to benefit from it, provided there will be no desecration of God&#x2019;s Name, [for example] in such a case where he remains unaware of his mistake. It is best to say to him, &#x201C;I am relying on your estimate or your bill.&#x201D;</p>
<p>5) If you covet the house or the vessels of your neighbor, or anything which your neighbor has no intention of selling, and you ask his friends to influence him, or if you, yourself, pressure him until he agrees to sell it to you, you have violated the injunction, &#x201C;You shall not covet.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1207">6</xref></sup> From the moment you were tempted, and began to think, how will you acquire this item, you have violated the command, &#x201C;You shall not desire&#x201D;;<sup><xref rid="fn1208">7</xref></sup> for desire is only in the heart, and desire leads one to covet. If you ultimately buy that which you had desired, you will have transgressed two negative commands. That is why it is said, &#x201C;You shall not covet&#x201D; and &#x201C;You shall not desire.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1209">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) The robber is enjoined by a positive command, to return the stolen article if it is in its original state, and has not been altered. As it is said, &#x201C;He shall return <italic>that</italic> which he robbed.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1210">9</xref></sup> The same law applies to a thief.<sup><xref rid="fn1211">10</xref></sup> This obligation cannot be fulfilled merely with the return of money to the owner, even when he had already given up hope of getting it back. However, if the stolen article was lost or altered in such a way that it cannot be restored to its original state, or it was sunk into a building, and will cause him a great loss to tear down the building, the obligation may be fulfilled by paying a sum of money equivalent to its worth at the time of the robbery. If the victim of the robbery is in another town, the robber is not required to send the money to him, but he should notify him to come and get it. If the victim died, the robber must pay the restitution to his heirs.</p>
<p>7) He who robs the public&#x2014;such as a shopkeeper who gives a short measure, or weighs with a short weight, or the like, or a public official who is lenient towards his relatives, and exacting towards others, or one who took usury from the public, will find it difficult to repent adequately. Therefore, he should establish a community service, so that his victims, too, might benefit from them.<sup><xref rid="fn1212">11</xref></sup> Nevertheless, if the identity of his victims are known to him, he is obligated to make restitution, and he does not fulfill this obligation merely by contributing to a public service.</p>
<p>8) It is forbidden to buy from a thief, or a robber, any article that was stolen or robbed. There is no difference if he is a Jew or a non-Jew, for the non-Jew is also commanded not to steal or rob even from another non-Jew; and this is one of the seven precepts which they have been commanded. It is a serious sin to buy from a thief or a robber, for in doing so you are abetting evildoers. With reference to this it is said, &#x201C;He who is a partner with a thief, hates his own soul,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1213">12</xref></sup> and he causes the thief to commit other acts of stealing; for if he will find no buyer he will not steal. Although it is possible for the thief to take the stolen article to a place where he is not known, this course is not always available to him. If the buyer&#x2019;s intention is for the owner&#x2019;s benefit, in order to restore it to him, upon payment of the money he advanced, it is permissible; provided it is impossible for the owner himself to recover it. It is also forbidden to accept for safekeeping, anything which appears to be stolen.</p>
<p>9) It is forbidden to derive the slightest benefit from property that was stolen or robbed while it is in the possession of the thief or robber. Even a trivial benefit that its owner would not mind, such as exchanging the money for an equal amount of another denomination is forbidden in the case of money that was stolen or robbed. It is also forbidden to enter a stolen house to [protect yourself] from the hot sun or from the rain, or to pass through a stolen field.</p>
<p>10) It is forbidden to derive benefit from the possessions of one who is a known thief or robber, who has no other occupation, and whose entire property is presumed to have been acquired by theft or robbery, and a poor man is forbidden to accept charity from him.</p>
<p>11) Similarly, it is forbidden to buy something from someone who wishes to sell an article that apparently had been stolen as when fruit watchmen sell fruit in a secluded spot, or when a salesman conceals the merchandise he is trying to sell, or when he says to the buyer, &#x201C;Hide it.&#x201D; It is forbidden to buy something from a woman when there is reason to suspect that she is selling it without her husband&#x2019;s consent, or to buy women&#x2019;s jewelry or clothing from a man, when there is reason to suspect that he is selling them without his wife&#x2019;s consent.</p>
<p>12) If you inadvertently exchanged coats at a wedding hall or another public place, you are not allowed to use these items that came into your possession, and are not yours. When the rightful owner appears you must return it to him, even if yours had been lost there. Also, in case a commercial launderer gave you someone else&#x2019;s garment, you are forbidden to wear it, but must return it to its rightful owner; even though yours was lost. However, if the article was with you so long that it is impossible the owner did not inquire after his things during this time, then you are permitted to wear it, for you may assume that the launderer satisfied the owner, and paid him for this garment.</p>
<p>13) It is forbidden to use anything belonging to your fellow without his knowledge. Even if you are certain that when the owner finds out he will be happy and elated that you used it, because of his good feelings towards you; nevertheless it is forbidden. Therefore, if you enter the orchard or garden belonging to your neighbor, it is forbidden to pluck fruit without the owner&#x2019;s knowledge, even though the owner of the orchard and the owner of the garden is truly a dear, cherished friend, and will certainly be happy and elated when finding out that you enjoyedhis fruit. Nevertheless, since at the present time he knows nothing of this, you are enjoying it unlawfully.<sup><xref rid="fn1214">13</xref></sup> It is necessary to warn the public regarding this; for they break this rule for lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>14) However, it is permitted for a member of your household to give a slice of bread to a poor man, or to the owner&#x2019;s friend&#x2019;s son without his knowledge, for this is customary among people, and is not considered as something done without the owner&#x2019;s knowledge since this is customary, and the owner is aware of this custom. For this reason it is permitted to accept charity from women, if it is a small contribution, even without her husband&#x2019;s knowledge, since this is the general custom, and husbands are aware of this custom. Also, with regard to an orchard, if you are generally acustomed to eat of its fruit with the owner&#x2019;s knowledge, you are permitted to do so (even without his knowledge). And so it is in all similar cases.</p>
<p>15) If you find fruit on the road underneath a tree, that overhangs the road, if it is the type of fruit that usually falls from the tree, and becomes spoiled after falling, or even it it does not become spoiled, but most people who pass by are non-Jews, or if it is the type of fruit that animals are accustomed to eat, and animals do pass by, [it may be assumed that] the owner has already abandoned his ownership, and you are permitted to take them. However, if it is fruit that does not become spoiled by the fall, and if most of the people passing by are Jews, it is forbidden to take them because it is considered robbery, If the fruit belongs to minor orphans, it is forbidden to take it in any case, because minors cannot waive their rights of ownership.</p>
<p>16) The law of existing government must be recognized as the law (in civil matters).<sup><xref rid="fn1215">14</xref></sup></p>

<title>Chapter 183 The Laws of Property Damages</title>
<p>1) It is forbidden to damage someone&#x2019;s property even with the intention of making reparation, just as it is forbidden to steal or to rob with the intention of making restitution. It is even forbidden to cause damage to your neighbor, either by deed or by word. For example, if Reuven sold merchandise to a non-Jew, and Shimon came along and told the non-Jew that it is not worth so much money, although it is really true, it is forbidden to do so. He who indirectly causes damage to his neighbor, although he is exempt in the court of Beis Din, he is liable in the (Heavenly Court) until he placates his neighbor.</p>
<p>2) Even if you sustain a loss, you are forbidden to remove the cause of your damage if by doing so you will cause damage to your neighbor, for it is forbidden to salvage your property by causing damage to another even indirectly. However, before the damage is done to you, it is permitted to forestall it so that it doesn&#x2019;t occur, even though by doing so, it will cause a loss to your neighbor. For example, if a stream of water is threatening to flood your field, before the water reaches your field, you are permitted to construct a dam in its path, even though this will cause it to flood your neighbor&#x2019;s field.<sup><xref rid="fn1216">1</xref></sup> But if the water had already entered your field, you are forbidden to divert it to your neighbor&#x2019;s field. For since the damage has already occured, you are not permitted to divert it from your field, and direct it to your neighbor&#x2019;s field.</p>
<p>3) Also, if an army arrived in town, and the townspeople are obliged to provide them with room and board, it is forbidden to offer a bribe to the commanding officer for an exemption; because this will cause a loss to other Jews. Also, in all cases of taxes, it is forbidden to influence the officer to exempt you, if by doing so, you make the burden heavier for others. One who does such a thing is called an <italic>informer</italic>.</p>
<p>4) It is forbidden to surrender a Jew or his property into the hands of non-Jews. [It is also forbidden] whether by deed or by word to inform on [a Jew] or to divulge his hiding place. Whoever acts as an informer has no share in the World to Come. Even if the person is an evildoer and a sinner, it is forbidden to surrender him or his property; even if he troubles you, and constantly provokes you with words. However, if someone informed on you, and you cannot save yourself unless you inform on your informer, you are permitted to do so.</p>
<p>5) It is forbidden to enter the ploughed field of your neighbor because you will spoil it by trampling upon it.</p>
<p>6) It is forbidden to stand at your neighbor&#x2019;s field, to gaze at it at the time the crops are standing (ready for harvest), so as not to harm them with an &#x201C;evil eye.&#x201D; It is certainly forbidden to gaze at someone in a way that might damage him personally, [as a result] of an &#x201C;evil eye.&#x201D; Even with regard to his business and occupation where there is no cause to fear an &#x201C;evil eye&#x201D;, if he works in his own house or property, it is forbidden to watch him without his knowledge, for he may not want others to know of his business and occupation. It is good manners, when seeing someone engaged at his work, to bless him and say to him, &#x201C;May you be successful at your task.&#x201D;</p>
<p>7) Even on your own premises it is forbidden to engage in an activity that may cause damage to your neighbor. Thus, you must avoid placing in your yard, near your neighbor&#x2019;s wall, anything that generates heat or releases warm gasses or vapors, and damages the wall, such as manure and similar things, unless you keep them at a distance of three <italic>tefachim</italic>. You must also keep a distance not to spill water near your neighbor&#x2019;s wall. Therefore, the (outlet of) the roof&#x2019;s drain pipe must be kept a distance of three <italic>tefachim</italic> from your neighbor&#x2019;s wall. You most certainly may not spill a pot of urine close to your neighbor&#x2019;s wall. With regard to urinating close to your neighbor&#x2019;s wall, if the wall is of stone, or of wood, without plaster, a distance of one <italic>tefach</italic> is sufficient. If the wall is of bare rock, you need not distance yourself at all, and may urinate on the wall itself. If the wall is brick, or of wood covered with plaster, you must keep a distance of three <italic>tefachim</italic>.</p>

<title>Chapter 184 The Laws of Physical Injury</title>
<p>1) It is forbidden to strike your fellow Jew, and if you do strike him you are transgressing a Divine negative command, as it is said, &#x201C;If the wicked man deserves to be beaten etc., he should be given forty stripes, he shall not exceed, lest he exceed.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1217">1</xref></sup> If the Torah is concerned not to strike a wicked person more than prescribed for his evil, all the more so does this apply to the striking of the righteous. Whoever raises his hand against another to strike him, even if he does not actually strike him, is called a <italic>rasha</italic> (wicked person) as it is said, &#x201C;And he said to the <italic>rasha:</italic> &#x2018;Why will you strike your neighbor?&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1218">2</xref></sup> It is not said, &#x201C;Why have you struck,&#x201D; but &#x201C;Why will you strike;&#x201D; although he did not actually strike him, he is called a <italic>rasha</italic>. Whoever strikes his fellow Jew has been excommunicated by the early Sages. He can not be counted as one of a quorum of ten required for the performance of sacred rituals, until <italic>Beis Din</italic> releases him from excommunication, upon his acceptance to abide by their decisions.<sup><xref rid="fn1219">3</xref></sup> However, if someone strikes you or a fellow Jew, and you are unable to save yourself or your fellow Jew from the attacker unless you strike him, you are permitted to strike him.</p>
<p>2) Even if your servant disobeys you, you are forbidden to strike him. However, you are permitted to strike your young children, or [even] an orphan whom you are raising in your home, in order to admonish them and guide them on the proper way, as this is for their ultimate benefit.</p>
<p>3) You must be careful not to throw pieces of broken glass and the like in any place where they may cause harm to anyone.</p>
<p>4) If your neighbor suffers from a headache, which may be aggravated by the noise of hammering, you are forbidden to pound grits even in your own house, or anything similar to them, should the sound of their pounding carry to your neighbor&#x2019;s house and cause him harm.<sup><xref rid="fn1220">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>5) There are many more things that are forbidden because they cause harm to your neighbors, or to the public. The general principle is that it is forbidden to do anything, even on your own premises, and especially on a public domain, that may cause damage to your neighbor or to passers by in a public domain, unless it is generally accepted that whoever wishes to do this activity may do so. For in such case, it is as if all the townspeople sanctioned this activity, so that each of them has the privilege to do so whenever he needs to; he, or his children (etc.).</p>
<p>6) If you frighten someone, such as by suddenly screaming behind him, or by appearing suddenly before him in the dark, or anything similar, you will be answerable to the Heavenly court.<sup><xref rid="fn1221">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>7) If you injure your neighbor, although you paid the injured person all that you owe him for his injury; also a thief or a robber, although he had returned the article, or made restitution for it, nevertheless, there cannot be atonement until you seek forgiveness from the injured, or from the victim for the pain you caused them. They, for their part, should forgive and not be harsh in refusing.</p>
<p>8) If you see that your neighbor is in trouble, and you are able to save him, or to hire others to save him, you are obliged to trouble yourself or to hire others to save him. If he has the money to pay, you may ask him to repay the money you spent to save him. If he does not have the money, nevertheless, you may not shirk your duty because of this, and you must save him at your own expense. If you refuse to do so, you are guilty of transgressing the negative command, &#x201C;Do not stand idly by when the blood of your neighbor [is in danger].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1222">6</xref></sup> Likewise, if you hear wicked people devising a plot against your fellow Jew, or setting a trap for him, and you did not reveal it to him, or if you were able to appease them with money on his behalf, and thereby cause them to discard their plot, and you did not appease them, and other matters similar to this, you are guilty of transgressing the negative command, &#x201C;Do not stand idly by when the blood of your neighbor&#x201D; is in danger.<sup><xref rid="fn1222">6</xref></sup> He who saves one Jewish life is considered as if he had saved the whole world.<sup><xref rid="fn1223">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>9) A person who is involved in counterfeiting (money) and it is feared he will jeopardize others,<sup><xref rid="fn1224">8</xref></sup> is considered as one who is endangering the lives of others. He must be warned to give up this activity. If he does not heed the warning, it is permitted to denounce him to the government, and to declare that no one else is engaged in this practice aside from him. Also, if a person is falsely accused because of him [the counterfeiter], he may tell them, &#x201C;I am not involved in this, but so and so is the only one involved&#x201D;.</p>
<p>10) It had been the custom for the seven elders of the city<sup><xref rid="fn1225">9</xref></sup> to set fines in cases of injuries, insults, and the like. (However,) they must not do anything independently of the <italic>Beis Din</italic>, since in regard to these matters, there are many diverse laws, and they may not impose a fine greater than what the <italic>halachah</italic> imposes. They should also not treat the dignity of the people lightly.</p>
<p>11) When a woman has severe complications in childbirth, so long as the fetus is unborn, it may be destroyed, either with medicine or with instruments; for as long as it is unborn it is not considered a living soul; and in order to save the [life of the] mother, it is permitted to destroy it; for it is like someone attempting to take the life of another.<sup><xref rid="fn1226">10</xref></sup> However, as soon as its head protrudes,<sup><xref rid="fn1227">11</xref></sup> it must not be touched, for one life is not to be sacrificed to save another, and this is the way of nature.<sup><xref rid="fn1228">12</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn1220">4. This is included among the things that are not permitted, even if you were living in your house before your neighbor moved there. <italic>Ashri</italic> says the reason is because it is easier for you to remove the causative factor, than it is for him to move.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 185 Laws of Borrowing and Hiring</title>
<p>1) If you borrow or rent an animal or other articles from your neighbor, you are not permitted to lend them or rent them to another party without the consent of the owner. Even in the case of sacred books, the lending of which is a meritorious act, we do not assume that the owner would want to have a mitzvah done with his property, for it is possible he does not want his property in the possession of someone who may not be trustworthy in his eyes. However, if you borrow a book, you may allow someone else to study from it in your house, provided he studies from it alone and not two [of you] together. If it is known that the owner is accustomed to trust this other party in such matters, the borrower is permitted to lend it to him, and the renter is permitted to rent it to him.</p>
<p>2) It is a mitzvah to pay the wages of a hired workman on time, and if you delay such payment, you are transgressing a negative commandment, as it is said, &#x201C;On the same day you shall give him his wages, and the sun shall not go down on it.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1229">1</xref></sup> It is also a mitzvah to pay for the hire of an animal or a utensil at the proper time, and if you delay such payment, you are transgressing a negative command, as it is said &#x201C;You shall not oppress a hired worker who is poor and needy etc., in the same day you must give his wage.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1230">2</xref></sup> What is the proper time? If he finished his work during the day, he should be paid before the end of that day. If the day has passed and you still did not pay him, you are transgressing the mitzvah of &#x201C;In the same day you should give him his wage, and the sun shall not go down on it.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1229">1</xref></sup> If he finished his work during the evening, he should be paid during that night. If the night passed and you had not paid him, you are transgressing the negative command, &#x201C;The wages of your worker shall not abide with you (all the night) until the morning.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1231">3</xref></sup> Similarly, a workman who is hired by the week, or month, or year, if he has finished his work during the day, he should be paid during that day; if he finished during the night, he should be paid during that night and not later.</p>
<p>3) Also, if you gave your garment to a tailor to repair, for a set price, and the tailor returns it to you during the day, you must pay him during that day. And if he returned it to you at night, you must pay him during that night. However, so long as the garment remains with the tailor, although the garment is finished, and the work has been completed, you are not in violation of the law, even if it is in the tailor&#x2019;s possession for many days, and even if the tailor has notified you to bring the money and take the garment nevertheless, you are not in violation of the law.</p>
<p>4) You have not transgressed the law of: &#x201C;The wages of your worker shall not abide with you&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1231">3</xref></sup> [or the law of] &#x201C;That the sun shall not go down on it,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1229">1</xref></sup> unless the worker demands his wages, and you have the money to pay him. But if the worker did not demand his wages, or he demanded his wages but you do not have the money, you are not in violation of the law. Nevertheless,<sup><xref rid="fn1232">4</xref></sup> a scrupulous person will borrow money to pay his worker in the proper time, for he is poor and sets his heart upon his wage. If your system is not to pay the workers until after a certain sum is due, even if they demand a small sum, which they have undoubtedly already earned, nevertheless, (if you refuse to give it to them), you are not guilty of transgressing the law, since it is known that this is your system of payment, and on such condition they hired themselves out to you.</p>
<p>5) If a hired workman was working for you, and spoiled the article on which he had worked, even if it was caused by his negligence, in a manner in which he is legally bound to make reparation, it is a mitzvah for you to waive your legal rights, and release him from liability, as it is said: &#x201C;That you may walk in the way of good men.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1233">5</xref></sup> If the worker is a poor man, and has no food, it is a mitzvah to give him his wages, as it is said, &#x201C;And keep the paths of the righteous.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1233">5</xref></sup> and the path of the righteous is to keep the way of Hashem, to practice charity and justice, to an even greater degree than is required by law.<sup><xref rid="fn1234">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) Just as the employer is admonished not to rob the worker of his wages, and not to delay payment, so is the worker admonished not to cheat his employer by wasting time at work. He must work with all his strength [ability,] as our father, Jacob, peace unto him, said, &#x201C;That I served your father with all my strength.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1235">7</xref></sup> Therefore, a worker is not permitted to work all night, and hire himself out during the day because he has been weakened by the night work. Similarly, it is not permitted to work your animal at night and hire it out for work during the day. A worker is not permitted to starve or afflict himself, for this weakens his physical strength, and he will not be able to do the work for his employer properly. This law applies also to a teacher.

<title>Chapter 186 The Laws of Muzzling Animals</title>
<p>1) Anyone who prevents an animal from eating while working is liable to be punished by flogging as it is said, &#x201C;You shall not muzzle the ox when it is threshing.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1236">1</xref></sup> It is immaterial whether it is an ox, or any other animal or beast, whether unclean or clean, whether it is threshing or any other work concerned with produce of the ground. The Torah mentions the ox and threshing only because it speaks of the usual circumstance. Even if it is muzzled by voice, that is, it is shouted at, and is thus prevented from eating, it is punishable by flogging.</p>
<p>2) A Jew who threshes (grain) even with an animal belonging to a non-Jew, and even if the grain belongs to a non-Jew, transgresses the commandment &#x201C;You shall not muzzle.&#x201D;</p>
<p>3) If the animal is unable to eat because it is thirsty, you must give it to drink.<sup><xref rid="fn1237">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>4) If an animal is working with something which would be harmful to its intestines, you are permitted to muzzle it; for the Torah is concerned with the benefit of the animal, and in such case it would not be to its benefit.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1236">1. <italic>Deuteronomy</italic> 25:4.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 187 The Laws of Articles Lost and Found</title>
<p>1) If you see an article that was lost by a Jew, it is your duty to care for it, and return it to its owner, as it is said, &#x201C;You shall surely return them.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1238">1</xref></sup> Similarly, any of your neighbor&#x2019;s property, that you are able to save from destruction, you are obliged to do so, for this is included in the mitzvah of returning a lost article.</p>
<p>2) Although according to <italic>halachah</italic>, in a place where the majority of the people are non-Jewish, even if the Jew identifies it you are not obliged to return it to him, because we assume he already had despaired of its recovery, nevertheless, it is good and proper to do more than the <italic>halachah</italic> requires, and return it to the Jew who identifies it; and we force him to do this.<sup><xref rid="fn1239">2</xref></sup> If the finder is a poor man, and the owner of the article is wealthy, the finder is not obligated to do more than the <italic>halachah</italic> requires. In a place where you are required by civil law to return a lost article, you must return it in all circumstances.</p>
<p>3) If you find an article regardless if it has an identification mark or not, if upon finding it, it was apparent that it had been placed there, such as a garment or an ax, that was left at the side of a fence;<sup><xref rid="fn1240">3</xref></sup> and even if it is doubtful whether they were purposely placed there, or lost there, it is forbidden to touch them.</p>
<p>4) If an old, respected man finds a lost article, that it is so shabby that even if it were his own, he would not carry it home, because it would be disgraceful to him, he is not obligated to bother with it. He should, nevertheless, do more than the <italic>halachah</italic> requires, and bother with it, even though it is beneath his dignity.</p>
<p>5) If you find an article and you do not know who lost it, whether it has a mark of identification, or does not have a mark of identification, these matters involve many divergent laws, and you should consult a Rav as to what you should do.</p>

Otherwise, if it is in a totally unprotected place and bears a mark of identification, you must take it and return it to its owner. If it bears no mark, you may take it for yourself. If you found it in a place that is partially protected, if it bears a mark, you must take it and return it to its owner. If it bears no mark, you must not touch it; just leave it there (<italic>Ramah</italic> 260:10). If in the last instance you picked it up, the <italic>Ramah</italic> says you must hold it until <italic>Eliyohu</italic>, the prophet, comes and reveals who the owner is.

<title>Chapter 188 Laws Concerning Bailments</title>
<p>1) If you deposit money with your neighbor, since most of us are involved in business, and we always need money, it is assumed that you agree that the depositary may use that money if he needs it. Therefore, the despositary is permitted to use the money, and the money is considered by him as a loan, unless you indicate to him that you do not wish it to be used. For instance, if you put the money in a sealed package, or tied it up with a special knot, the depositary is not permitted to use it.</p>
<p>2) If someone deposits an article with you, you are forbidden to use that article for your own needs even though the article will not spoil in the least by such use. Nevertheless, you would be borrowing it without the owner&#x2019;s knowledge, and he who borrows without the owner&#x2019;s knowledge is considered a robber. If you know definitely that your depositer would not object to your using it, you are permitted to use it. Some <italic>Poskim</italic> prohibit this too, because with regard to a deposit, it is forbidden to use even something whose use people generally do not object to, because it is considered a fraudulent use of a deposit even in such circumstances. You should follow the stricter opinion.</p>
<p>3) It is your duty to safeguard the deposit in the most effective manner, in accordance with the accepted manner of safeguarding such articles. Even though you are not so particular to guard your own property so carefully, nevertheless with property entrusted to you, you must take special care.</p>
<p>4) You are not permitted to entrust the deposit with other people, even though they are more fit and trustworthy than yourself, unless the depositor is also accustomed to entrust these kinds of things with them.</p>
<p>5) When you return the deposit, you should not return it to any member of the depositor&#x2019;s household without his consent. This is also true when you return any article that was lent to you, or when you pay a debt. However, you may return it to his wife, as it may be assumed that she manages the household, and her husband entrusts everything with her.</p>

<title>Chapter 189 Laws of Unloading and Loading</title>
<p>1) If you meet your neighbor on the road and his animal is lying underneath its load, whether its burden was a proper load for it, or it was burdened with a load that was too heavy for it, it is a mitzvah to assist him to unload the burden, as it is said, &#x201C;You shall surely help him.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1241">1</xref></sup> After you have helped unload the burden, you should not leave your neighbor in distress, and go on your way, but you should help him reload it, as it is said, &#x201C;You shall surely help him lift it up again.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1242">2</xref></sup> If you leave your neighbor, and did not help him in unloading and loading, you have neglected to perform an affirmative command, and have transgressed a negative command, as it is said, &#x201C;You shall not see the donkey of your neighbor [or his ox fallen down by the way and conceal yourself.]&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1242">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) If after you helped to unload and reload, the animal fell down again, you must help unload and reload again, even a hundred times, as it is said, &#x201C;You shall surely help&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1241">1</xref></sup> (and) &#x201C;You shall surely help him lift it up.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1242">2</xref></sup> Therefore, you must go with him a distance of a <italic>parsah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1243">3</xref></sup> as he might need your help again, unless the owner of the load tells you, &#x201C;I no longer need your help.&#x201D;</p>
<p>3) The unloading must be done gratis, but you are not obliged to reload unless he is willing to compensate you and he must also compensate you for accompanying him.</p>
<p>4) If the animal belongs to a non-Jew, and the non-Jew was driving the animal, whether the load belongs to a Jew, or it belongs to a non-Jew, you are only obliged to help unload because of the suffering of the animal, and you may receive compensation for it. But you are not at all obliged to help him reload, unless it would cause animosity. If the non-Jew is not present, and a Jew drives the animal, you must also help him reload, because of the distress to the Jew. If the animal belongs to a Jew and the load belongs to a non-Jew, you are obliged to help unload and reload because of the distress of the Jew.</p>
<p>5) It is written,<sup><xref rid="fn1244">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;If you see the donkey of your enemy lying under its burden,&#x201D; etc. This &#x201C;enemy&#x201D; does not refer to a non-Jew. (They are not included in the command regarding loading and unloading, unless the animal suffers), but it refers to a Jew. And how can one Jew hate another Jew since the Torah states, &#x201C;You shall not hate your brother in your heart&#x201D;?<sup><xref rid="fn1245">5</xref></sup> The Sages said: &#x201C;For instance: if you actually saw him transgress a law, and warned him against it, and he did not desist, it is a mitzvah to hate him until he repents,<sup><xref rid="fn1246">6</xref></sup> and abandons his wickedness. Even though he has not yet repented, if you find him in distress on the account of his load, it is a mitzvah to help him unload and reload, and not leave him without help, for he may stay there out of concern for his money and may endanger his life.&#x201D; The Torah is concerned regarding Jewish lives, whether they are wicked or righteous, so long as they cleave to Hashem, and believe in the principal tenets of our religion, as it is said, &#x201C;Say to them: as I live says <italic>Hashem Elokim</italic>, I do not desire the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1247">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) If a group was traveling together, and it happened to one of them that the legs of his donkey became lame, the other members of the group are not permitted to depart with their donkeys and leave him alone on the road. However, if his donkey fell down, and is unable to continue the journey, they are permitted to leave him, and need not tarry for his sake longer than is reasonable. Also, a group traveling in vehicles, if one of them broke down, and requires a short time to repair, the rest of the group are not permitted to depart from him, unless they would be detained beyond a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<title>Chapter 190 Laws of Protection of Life and Property</title>
<p>1) It is an affirmative mitzvah to make a fence around the rooftop of your house, as it is said, &#x201C;And you shall make a fence for your roof.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1248">1</xref></sup> The height of the fence must not be less than ten <italic>tefachim</italic> [high],<sup><xref rid="fn1249">2</xref></sup> and it should be so strong that if a man leans against it, it will not fall. The roofs of our houses, which we do not use, are exempt from this law. Indeed, not only rooftops require a fence, but any place where there is danger that a person could meet a fatal accident must have a fence and or other protection. Anyone who leaves it without a fence violates an affirmative precept and transgresses a negative precept, as it is said, &#x201C;You shall not bring blood upon your house.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1250">3</xref></sup> For instance, if there is a hole (well) in your property, you are obligated to make a fence around it, [that is at least] ten <italic>tefachim</italic> high, or you must cover it so that no one will fall in to it.</p>
<p>2) Similarly, it is a mitzvah to remove any obstacle that represents a possible danger to life. You must also take care to protect yourself from it, as it is said, &#x201C;Preserve yourself, and preserve your soul (life) diligently.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1251">4</xref></sup> If you neglect and do not remove potentially dangerous objects, you will have violated the affirmative mitzvah, and transgressed the negative command, &#x201C;You shall not bring blood upon your house.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1252">5</xref></sup> This is applicable if you allow a broken ladder to remain in your house or property, or if you keep a vicious dog.</p>
<p>3) Just as you must guard your body, and not allow it to deteriorate, to be damaged or to be injured, as it is said, &#x201C;Preserve (guard) yourself, and preserve your soul (life) diligently;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1253">6</xref></sup> so, too, you must guard your property against destruction, ruin, or damage. Anyone who breaks a vessel, tears a garment, or destroys food or drink, or pollutes them, or throws away money, or spoils anything that is fit for man&#x2019;s enjoyment, violates a negative precept, as it is said, &#x201C;You shall not destroy its trees&#x201D; etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1254">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Chapter 191 Prohibition of Cruelty to Animals</title>
<p>1) The Torah forbids us to inflict suffering on any living creature. On the contrary, it is an obligation to remove the suffering of any creature, even if it is ownerless, and even if it belongs to a non-Jew. However, if they are troublesome to mankind, or if they are needed for medical purposes, or for any other purpose, it is permitted even to kill them, and we disregard their pain; for the Torah permits us to slaughter them. Therefore, it is permitted to pluck feathers from living geese [to use as a quill], if you have no other feather [with which to write]. However, people abstain from doing so because of cruelty.</p>
<p>2) When horses pull a wagon and come to a rough road, or to a steep hill, and cannot draw it further without help, it is a mitzvah to help, even if they belong to a non-Jew, because of the suffering of the animals, lest the non-Jew strike them harshly to force them to pull more than they are able.</p>
<p>3) It is forbidden to tie the legs of an animal, beast, or fowl, in a manner that causes them pain.<sup><xref rid="fn1255">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>4) It is forbidden to set a bird on eggs of a different species, for this is cruelty to animals.</p>
<p>5) It is forbidden to castrate a person, or an animal, beast, or fowl, whether unclean or clean, whether in <italic>Eretz Yisroel</italic> or outside of <italic>Eretz Yisroel</italic>. Anyone who castrates is punishable by flogging. Even to cause sterility through medical means to man or to any other male creature, is forbidden.</p>
<p>6) It is forbidden to tell a non-Jew to castrate our animals. According to some <italic>Poskim</italic>, it is forbidden even to sell an animal to a non-Jew, or to give it to him on condition to share the profits, if it is known that he will castrate it. Because a non-Jew is also included in the prohibition against castrating, thus in doing so, the Jew transgresses the precept, not to place a stumbling block before the blind. However, if the non-Jewish buyer will not castrate it himself, but will give it to another non-Jew, for castration, all <italic>Poskim</italic> permit the transaction, for it is an indirect stumbling block and is permitted.</p>

<title>Chapter 192 Laws of The Sick, the Physician, and Remedies</title>
<p>1) Said <italic>Rav Yitzchok</italic> the son of <italic>Rav Yehudah</italic>, &#x201C;One should always plead for mercy that he should not get sick, for if one falls sick, he is told, &#x2018;Demonstrate your merit and you will be acquitted.&#x2019;&#x201D; Said <italic>Mar Ukva</italic>, &#x201C;From which verse in the Torah is this inferred?&#x201D; From the verse, &#x201C;Lest any man fall from (<italic>mimenu</italic>) there.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1256">1</xref></sup> From within himself (<italic>mimenu</italic>) he must produce evidence; which means, since he has fallen, he must produce from within himself and from his deeds, evidence of his merit.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1257">2</xref></sup> It is also stated in the Talmud,<sup><xref rid="fn1257">2</xref></sup> &#x201C;If a person has a headache he should view it as if he were put in chains. If he becomes ill and is confined to bed, he should view it as if he were placed onto a scaffold, (a place where capital cases are tried) for trial. Anyone who is placed onto the scaffold for trial, if he has great advocates, may be saved. But if he has none, he cannot be saved. These are the advocates of man: repentance and good deeds. Even if nine hundred and ninety-nine accuse him, and only one advocate defends him, he is saved, as it is said, &#x201C;If there be for him an angel, an advocate, [even] one among a thousand, to vouch for man&#x2019;s uprightness, then he is gracious unto him, and says, &#x2018;Redeem him from going down to the pit.&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1258">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) Rabbi Pinchas, the son of Chama, expounded,<sup><xref rid="fn1259">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;Anyone who has a sick person in his house, should go to a Sage and ask him to plead for mercy on his behalf, as it is said, &#x201C;The wrath of a king is like messengers of death. But a wise man will pacify it.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1260">5</xref></sup> It is customary to give charity to the poor on a sick person&#x2019;s behalf, for repentance, prayer, and charity, avert the evil decree. It is also customary to bless the sick person in the synagogue, and if he is critically ill, we bless him even on Shabbos and Yom Tov. At times the name of the sick person is changed, for a change of name may also nullify the decree.</p>
<p>3) The Torah permits a doctor to heal the sick, as it is said &#x201C;And he shall [pay] to have him healed properly.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1261">6</xref></sup> Therefore, a sick person should not rely on a miracle, but is obliged to follow the accepted procedure and call a physician to heal him. Many of the world&#x2019;s pious men have been cured by physicians. A person who refrains from calling in a physician (for himself) commits two wrongs: For one, it is forbidden to rely on a miracle in a life-threatening situation. This behavior causes one&#x2019;s sins to be remembered at a time of illness. Secondly, it is arrogant and presumptuous to rely on your righteousness that you will be healed in some miraculous manner. You should call the most competent physician but with all that, your heart should be turned to Heaven, and pray for mercy from the Faithful Healer, blessed is His Name trusting in Him alone.</p>
<p>4) It is a mitzvah for the competent physician to heal and is included in the mitzvah of saving a life. If he refrains from doing so, he is guilty of shedding blood, even if the patient has another physician, because not through every physician does a person merit to be cured, and it is perhaps Heavenly ordained that he shall be cured through him. However, one should not practice medicine unless he is an expert and there is no one more competent than him. For otherwise, he is guilty of bloodshed.</p>
<p>5) A person who is not critically ill, and can possibly be cured by permissable medication, is forbidden to take anything that is prohibited; although he must wait until he can obtain it, we do not permit him to take anything that is prohibited. If he specifically requires a prohibited article, if he must eat it in the way it is usually eaten, he is forbidden to eat it; even if it is only prohibited by Rabbinical ordinance, since his life is not in danger. However [if it can be eaten] in a manner by which he will not derive the usual pleasure, for instance, if a bitter substance is mixed with it, it is permitted. It is permitted to make a plaster of it or something similar, even if it is something the enjoyment of which is forbidden by the Torah, with the exception of <italic>kilayei hakerem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1262">7</xref></sup> and meat cooked with milk, which is forbidden to use even in a manner that it is not usual. These laws apply so long as no danger to life is involved. Regarding the laws of <italic>berachos</italic> upon eating and drinking medication, refer to Chapter 50:5 and Chapter 61:4. (Regarding the law when a child must eat <italic>chametz</italic> on <italic>Pesach</italic>, see the end of Chapter 117.)</p>
<p>6) Some <italic>Poskim</italic> say<sup><xref rid="fn1263">8</xref></sup> that all things, the enjoyment of which is Rabbinically prohibited, are permitted to be used for a cure, even for one who is not critically ill, and even in the manner by which they are regularly enjoyed, provided he does not eat or drink the forbidden article.</p>
<p>7) A person who is critically ill may use any forbidden article for his cure, for nothing can stand in the way of saving a life except idolatry, incest, and murder; for which one must give up his life and not transgress. Thus man may not cure himself by transgressing these sins.</p>
<p>8) A physician is permitted to let blood, and feel the pulse, or other parts of a woman even if she is married, and he may feel her vulnerable area, as is customary with physicians, since he does not do so in a sensual and immoral manner, but is merely practicing his profession. However, if his own wife is menstrually unclean, he should be stringent (and refrain from any of the above), if she is not critically ill and there is another doctor available who is as competent as he is. (See Chapter 153:14 where it is explained, whether a woman who is menstrually unclean is permitted to attend her husband when he is sick, or if he may attend her if she is sick, and see Chapter 143:15 if a son is permitted to let blood from his father, and similar laws.)</p>
<p>9) In case of abdominal illness, a man may not attend a woman, lest he will be overcome by desire, since he is healthy [and capable.] But a woman may attend a man since he is sick [and incapable.]</p>
<p>10) If you possess medication and your neighbor is ill and needs them, you are forbidden to raise their price unreasonably.</p>

<title>Chapter 193 The Laws of Visiting the Sick</title>
<p>1) When a person is ill it is a mitzvah for everyone to visit him, for we find that the Holy One, Blessed is He, visits the sick, as our Sages of blessed memory,<sup><xref rid="fn1264">1</xref></sup> explained the verse, &#x201C;And God appeared unto him [Abraham] in the plains of <italic>Mamre</italic>,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1265">2</xref></sup> teaching us that He came to visit Abraham when he was sick.<sup><xref rid="fn1266">3</xref></sup> Relatives and friends who are accustomed to visit him often, should go to visit him as soon as they hear of his illness. But casual acquaintances, who are not accustomed to visit him often, should not visit him immediately, so as not to deter his chances of recovery by labeling him a a sick person. They should therefore not visit Him until after three days. If, however, one becomes suddenly ill, even casual acquaintances should visit at once. Even a great man should visit a less important person, and even many times a day. The more often one visits, the more praiseworthy it is, providing it is not bothersome for the sick person. You should not visit your sick enemy, nor should you comfort him in his mourning, lest he think that you are rejoicing at his calamity. However, you may attend his funeral, for there is no concern that people will say that you are rejoicing at his downfall, since this is the end of every mortal. (In chapter 207:2 we learn that a sick person need not rise even before the <italic>Nasi</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1267">4</xref></sup> but if he wishes to stand we do not tell him to remain seated.)</p>
<p>2) When the patient lies on the ground, the visitor may not sit upon a chair which is more elevated than he is, because the Divine Presence is above the head of the sick, as it is said, &#x201C;<italic>Hashem</italic> will support him on the bed of his illness.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1268">5</xref></sup> But when the patient lies in bed, the visitor may sit on a chair or a bench.</p>
<p>3) The essence of the <italic>mitzvah</italic> to visit the sick, is to determine the needs of the patient to see what has to be done for him, and to make him comfortable with his friends. You must also bear in mind to pray for mercy on his behalf. If you visited him and did not pray for his recovery, you have not fulfilled the mitzvah. Therefore, you should not visit the sick during the first three hours of the day, because during this time every sick person has some relief from his illness, and as a result, you will not be concerned to pray for mercy on his behalf. Nor should you visit him during the three final hours of the day, for then the illness becomes more severe, and you might despair of his recovery and will not pray for mercy on his behalf.</p>
<p>4) When you pray for mercy on his behalf, if you are praying in his presence, you may pray in any language you wish, for you are, so to speak, praying before the Divine Presence, Who is at the bedside of the sick. If, however, you are not praying in his presence, for then the ministering angels are needed to uplift your prayer, and since they are not bound [to regard] all languages, you should pray in the Holy Tongue, and include him among all the sick of Yisrael. For by including him with the others, your prayer will be more readily heard because of the collective merit of the many sick ones. You should say to the sick man, &#x201C;May the Almighty have mercy on you, among all the sick of Yisrael.&#x201D; On Shabbos you should say, &#x201C;This is Shabbos, we are forbidden to wail, healing is soon to come, His mercy is great, rest in peace.&#x201D;</p>
<p>5) The visitors must speak to him with wisdom and intelligence. They should tell him that words do not determine life, nor do words determine death. They should tell him to give thought to his affairs and state whether he has loaned to others or deposited anything with others, or others with him. You should explain to him that imparting this information is no reason to fear death</p>
<p>6) He should not bequeath [all] his property to strangers, not even to charity, and leave his natural heirs with nothing. Whoever does so should realize that the spirit of the Sages is not content with him. This applies even if the heirs do not conduct themselves properly. However, if he also leaves the heirs, enough to provide sufficiently for them, he is permitted to leave the rest to others. A pious man should not sign as a witness, and should not give counsel in making a will in which the natural heirs are disinherited; even when the son who is being disinherited does not act properly, and the inheritance is left to his brother who is a Torah scholar, who acts properly; because it is possible that the worthless son will have good and decent children. Even to give less to one child and more to the other, is forbidden, according to one <italic>Poseik</italic>, and it is proper to heed his opinion. See the end of Chapter 26.</p>
<p>7) If the sick man has young children, or if he has both young and grown-up children, or if his wife is pregnant, he should appoint a guardian to act on behalf of the minor children, until they come of age.</p>
<p>8) If the sick person wants to make a <italic>Kinyan</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1269">6</xref></sup> in order to confirm his will, it may be done even on Shabbos. Also, if he wants to send for his relatives, it is permitted to hire a non-Jew on Shabbos, and to send him to bring them.</p>
<p>9) If a close relative of the patient dies, he should not be told about it, lest he become distressed. Even if he becomes aware of it, he should not be told to tear [his garment], lest it causes him greater anxiety. One should not cry or lament in his presence, whether the deceased was his relative, or even someone who was not a member of his family, lest he will fear that he too is dying. Those who comfort mourners in his presence must be silenced.</p>
<p>10) A person who has stomach problems should not be visited, because he may be embarrassed. A person who has an eye ailment, or one who has a headache, and also one who is critical, and to whom conversation is difficult, should not be visited personally. Rather you should enter an outer room and inquire there if he needs anything. You should be concerned of his pain and pray for mercy on his behalf.</p>
<p>11) If you have two <italic>mitzvos</italic> to perform, to visit the sick and to comfort a mourner, if you are able to do both, you should first visit the sick, so that you will pray for mercy on his behalf. If you cannot do both, comforting a mourner takes precedence, as this is an act of loving kindness toward both the living and the dead.</p>
<p>12) A non-Jew may be visited during his illness, for the sake of maintaining harmonious relationships.</p>
<p>13) It is taught in the <italic>Sifrei</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1270">7</xref></sup> Rabbi Nossan says, &#x201C;The verse, &#x2018;and that person is guilty, they shall confess,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1271">8</xref></sup> teaches that all dying persons must confess.&#x201D; It is said in the <italic>Mishnah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1272">9</xref></sup> &#x201C;Everyone who confesses has a share in the World to Come, for so we find with Achar, to whom Joshua said, &#x2018;My son, please give glory to <italic>Adonoy</italic>, God of Yisrael, and confess to Him. Tell me what you have done, do not hide anything from me.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1273">10</xref></sup> Achar answered Joshua, and he said, &#x2018;Indeed I have sinned against <italic>Adonoy</italic>, God of Yisrael, and this is what I have done.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1274">11</xref></sup> How do we know his confession atoned for him? As it is said, &#x2018;Joshua said, &#x201C;Why have you afficted us? <italic>Adonoy</italic> will afflict you <italic>this day</italic>.&#x201D;&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1275">12</xref></sup> <italic>This day</italic> you will be afflicted, but you will not be afflicted in the World to Come.&#x201D; Therefore if the visitors notice that the patient is near death, they should tactfully turn the conversation and say to him, &#x201C;Make confession but don&#x2019;t be disturbed about it, for many have confessed and have recovered, and are alive, and many who did not confess have died. As a reward for your confession, you will be granted life, and all who confess have a share in the World to Come.&#x201D; If he cannot confess by word of mouth, he should confess with his heart. If he is able to speak only a few words, he should be told to say, &#x201C;May my death be an atonement for all my sins.&#x201D; He should also be told to ask the forgiveness of all he had wronged, whether in money matters or with words. None of these words should be said to him in the presence of the unlearned, or in the presence of women or children, for it may cause them to weep and thereby break the heart of the sick man.</p>
<p>14) A brief form of confession [is as follows]: I avow unto You <italic>Adonoy</italic>, my God, and the God of my fathers, that my recovery as well as my death are in Your hands. May it be Your will to heal me with a complete recovery; and if I am to die, may my death be an atonement for all my sins, iniquities and transgressions which I have sinned, perpetrated and transgressed before you. Grant me a share in <italic>Gan Eiden</italic>, and cause me to merit [the life of] the World to Come, which is reserved for the righteous. If he [the sick one] wants to make a lengthy confession, like the confession of Yom Kippur, he may do so. The forms of confession are found in the worthy <italic>seifer, Maavar Yaabok</italic>. The <italic>seifer, Chochmas Adom</italic>, has copied the confession form of the <italic>Ramban</italic> (Nachmanides), of blessed memory.</p>

<title>Chapter 194 Laws Pertaining To A Person Near Death, And Guarding The Body Of The Deceased.</title>
<p>1) A person who is very near death is considered as a living being in every respect.<sup><xref rid="fn1276">1</xref></sup> It is, therefore, forbidden to touch him, for anyone who touches him is considered like one who sheds blood. To what can this be compared? To a dripping [flickering] candle, which becomes extinguished as soon as someone touches it. Even if he is critical over a long period, and he and his family are in great agony, it is, nevertheless, forbidden to hasten his death in any way.<sup><xref rid="fn1277">2</xref></sup> [It is forbidden] for example to remove a feathered pillow from under him, because some people say that feathers of certain birds defer death, or for example to place the keys to the synagogue under his head; all these things are forbidden. However, if there is something which prevents the departure of the soul, such as a pounding noise or something similar, it is permitted to remove it since this is not a direct act, but merely the removal of the deterrent [to his death], without touching the dying person.</p>
<p>2) Although it is forbidden to touch a dying person, nevertheless, if a fire breaks out, he should not be left in the house, rather he should be taken out of the house. His removal takes precedence over the rescue of sacred books.</p>
<p>3) Those who are attending the dying person, should see to it that no limb of his projects from his bed, as it is said concerning Jacob, &#x201C;And he gathered up his feet to the bed.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1278">3</xref></sup> Therefore, they should place chairs at [the side of] the bed, so that he cannot extend a hand or foot outside it. Nevertheless, if this was not done, and his hand or foot was extended, it is forbidden to touch him in order to put it back.</p>
<p>4) From the moment that his death is imminent, no one is permitted to leave him, so that his soul does not depart when he is alone, because the soul is shocked as it departs from the body. It is a mitzvah to stand by a person, as the soul is departing from him, as it is said, &#x201C;Shall he then live forever, shall he never see the grave? For he sees that wise men die, etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1279">4</xref></sup> It is proper to gather ten adult males to be present at the departure of the soul. They must not God forbid engage in idle talk, rather they should engage in Torah subjects, and in the recitation of Psalms and other supplication, as arranged in the <italic>seifer, Maavar Yabbok</italic>. It is customary to light candles in the presence of a dying person.</p>
<p>5) After the departure of the soul, a light feather is placed at his nostrils. If it does not move, it is certain that he is dead. The windows should then be opened, and the mourners should recite the prayer, <italic>Tzidduk Ha Din</italic>, (The righteousness of Divine judgement.) When they say the <italic>berachah, Baruch Dayan ha-emes</italic> [Blessed is the true Judge], they should include in it, the Divine Name, (<italic>Adonoy Elokeinu</italic>) and the mention of His kingdom, (<italic>Melech haolam</italic>). [The complete <italic>berachah</italic> is thus: <italic>Baruch atah Adonoy, Elokeinu, Melech haolam, Dayan ha-emes</italic>.] They then tear their garments, according to the laws stated in the next chapter.</p>
<p>6) All those attending the deceased when the soul departs, must tear their garments.<sup><xref rid="fn1280">5</xref></sup> To what is this [death] compared? To the burning of a <italic>Seifer</italic> Torah, for there is no one in Yisrael who is [totally] void of Torah knowledge and the performance of mitzvos. Even at the death of a child who studied Scriptures, or at the death of a woman, the garments must be torn. Even if the deceased had at times committed a sin to satisfy his lustful desire, the garments must be torn at his death. However if the person committed a sin regularly, even though he did so only to satisfy his lustful desire, he is considered among those who have departed from the ways of the community, and the garments are not torn at his death. Regarding the tearing of the garments at the death of one for whom you are not a mourner, and you are tearing your garment only because you are present at the time of the soul&#x2019;s departure, it is sufficient if you make a slight tear, even at the side or at the hem.</p>
<p>7) The eyes of the deceased must be closed. If there are sons, it should be done by his son, as it is said, &#x201C;Joseph shall place his hand upon your eyes.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1281">6</xref></sup> If there is a firstborn son, he should do it.</p>
<p>8) When lifting the deceased from his bed to lay him on the floor, care must be taken to keep him covered, for all the customs of modesty that apply to the living, apply also to the dead</p>
<p>9) It is customary to pour out all the water from the vessels in the vicinity of the deceased, which is three houses (including the one in which the deceased lies.) This is done even for an infant who died within thirty days of its birth. If death occurs on Shabbos the water need not be poured out. (<italic>Birkei Yoseif</italic> writes, that one should be stringent and pour out the water even on Shabbos.)</p>
<p>10) The person who guards the deceased,<sup><xref rid="fn1282">7</xref></sup> even if he is not a mourner, is exempt from <italic>Kerias Shema</italic> and <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>, and from all other mitzvos of the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn1283">8</xref></sup> for he who is engaged in the performance of a mitzvah is exempt from performing another mitzvah.<sup><xref rid="fn1284">9</xref></sup> If there are two two watchmen, [they should alternate] one of them should guard, while the other says <italic>Krias Shema</italic> and <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>.</p>
<p>11) It is forbidden to eat [a meal] in the room where the deceased lies,<sup><xref rid="fn1285">10</xref></sup> unless there is a partition. It is even forbidden to have a snack, even to eat fruit or drink water is forbidden. It is necessary to instruct the guards about this. It is also forbidden to recite a berachah there.</p>
<p>12) It is forbidden to move the deceased on Shabbos, even for the sake of [vacating the place for] <italic>kohanim</italic>, or for the sake of performing some mitzvah. It may be done however by a non-Jews, if the relatives consent to it.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1276">1. Nevertheless, a <italic>kohein</italic> is forbidden to enter the house of a dying person. See Chapter 205:1 for details.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1277">2. There is a question if it is permitted to give him a drastic, medicine that could either cure him or perhaps hasten his death. According to <italic>Shevus Yaakov</italic> Volume III Response 75, it is permitted to do so only if the majority of the doctors concur and the chief <italic>Poseik</italic> agrees.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1278">3. <italic>Genesis</italic> 49:33.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1279">4. <italic>Psalms</italic> 49:10&#x2013;11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1280">5. According to <italic>Zohor L&#x2019;Avrohom</italic>, our custom is that those who are present when the soul departs <italic>do not tear</italic> their garments. The reason is that we do not want the person to die alone, as people will not want to be present if it means tearing their garments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1281">6. <italic>Genesis</italic> 46:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1282">7. The deceased must be guarded from rodents. See <italic>Mishnah Beruch</italic> 71:12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1283">8. He is not permitted to be stringent in this matter. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic>, Ibid.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1284">9. This general rule applies only if the second mitzvah involves some extra effort, but if they can both be done without extra effort, both mitzvos should be performed. (<italic>Rema</italic> 38:8, See <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic>.)</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 195 The Laws of Tearing the Garments</title>
<p>1) When a person suffers the loss [the death] of one for whom he is obligated to mourn, he must tear his garments because of it. He must tear his garments while standing, as it is said, &#x201C;And the king arose and tore his garments.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1286">1</xref></sup> If he tore his garments while sitting, he has not fulfilled his obligation, and he must again tear his garments while standing. Initially he should tear them before the deceased is covered in the grave, when his sorrow is still intense.</p>
<p>2) For the dead for whom one must observe laws of mourning, the tear in the garment must be made near the front of the neck. It must be made from the top, downward, and not in the width of the garment. The tear must be made in the very cloth of the garment,<sup><xref rid="fn1287">2</xref></sup> and not at the seam.</p>
<p>3) There are differences between tearing garments upon the death of a father or mother, and the tearing of garments upon the death of other relatives. For all deceased relatives, tearing a <italic>tefach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1288">3</xref></sup> of the outer garment is sufficient, and tearing it more than that is a transgression of, &#x201C;You shall not destroy.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1289">4</xref></sup> For a father or a mother, all the garments must be torn that are over against his heart, (see above Chapter 10:3 that the area of the heart is that which is opposite the bicep of the arm) except the undershirt which is not torn. Similarly, a garment that is worn only on occassions, over other garments, and at times one goes out without it, such as an overcoat, such a garment also does not need to be torn. If the mourner did not tear all the garments that he was required to tear, he has not fulfilled his obligation. Because of modesty, a woman should first tear her inner-garment in private, and turn the tear to the side, and then tear her outer garment, so as not to expose herself. (Even though she is covered by her undershirt, nevertheless, it would be immodest to do otherwise.)</p>
<p>4) Upon the death of other relatives, it is the custom to tear the right side of the garments, and upon the death of a father or a mother, [it is the custom] to tear the left side of the garments, because the mourner must expose his heart, which is on the left side of his body. [However] if it was done otherwise, it does not invalidate the fulfillment of his duty.</p>
<p>5) When tearing garments for all other deceased, it may be done by hand or with an instrument, but for a father or mother, it must be done by hand. It is customary for a member of the Burial Society to make a slight cut [in the garment] with a knife, and then the mourner takes hold of the place of the cut, and tears the garment. He must take care to tear the garment lengthwise and not in the width.</p>
<p>6) For all other relatives, if the mourner changes his garments during the <italic>shivah</italic> period,<sup><xref rid="fn1290">5</xref></sup> he need not tear the garments, that he is now going to wear; but for his father or mother, if he changes garments during the weekdays of the <italic>shivah</italic> period, he must tear the garments into which he has changed. However, in honor of Shabbos, he should change garments, and not wear garments that are torn. If he has no other garments in which to change, he should turn the torn part backwards to conceal it. Changing garments for Shabbos in this instance, means putting on other weekday clothes, but he is forbidden to wear his usual Shabbos garments.<sup><xref rid="fn1291">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>7) According to <italic>halachah</italic>, garments that were torn for relatives, may be stitched together loosely after the <italic>shivah</italic>, and completely sewn after the thirty day period. For his father or mother, the mourner may stitch them together after thirty days, but he may never sew them completely. Even to cut out the torn part of the garment, and replace it by sewing in another piece of cloth, is forbidden. The prevailing custom is that within the thirty day period, even for other relatives, it is forbidden even to stitch them together loosely. Even to join the torn edges together with pins is forbidden within the thirty day period. A woman who is in mourning for her father or mother, may stitch them together immediately for modesty. All torn garments, which are forbidden to be sewn, are forbidden to be sewn even if the garments are sold; and therefore, the seller must inform the buyer. It is forbidden to sell such garments to a non-Jew.</p>
<p>8) For all relatives who pass away, if one did not hear of their death until after thirty days, he need not tear his garments. [However] for a father or mother, the mourner must always tear the garments that he is wearing at the time he hears of their death.<sup><xref rid="fn1292">7</xref></sup> Nevertheless, if he changes his garments afterwards, he need not tear them.</p>
<p>9) The intervention of a Yom Tov, cancels the thirty day mourning period even in regard to tearing the garments. Therefore if Yom Tov intervenes during the thirty days of mourning for other relatives, the mourner may completely sew up the torn garment after the <italic>minchah</italic> prayer on the eve of Yom Tov. If he is in mourning for a father or mother, he may stitch together the torn garment.</p>
<p>10) If a person tore his garments for the loss of a relative, and another relative died during the <italic>shiva</italic> period,<sup><xref rid="fn1290">5</xref></sup> he should leave a space of three finger breadths away from the first tear, and tear another <italic>tefach</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn1288">3</xref></sup> or he should extend the originial tear by a <italic>tefach</italic>. But if the second death occured after the <italic>shivah</italic>, so long as he is wearing the torn garment, he need only extend the tear a bit and this is sufficient. However if the first death was that of some relative, and the second is that of his father or mother, then even after the [first] <italic>shivah</italic>, he must leave a space of three fingers breadths from the tear, and make a new tear as prescribed by the <italic>halachah</italic>, because the death of a father or mother is not considered merely as an additional sorrow. The same law applies when his father died first, and then his mother, or vice versa.</p>
<p>11) If a person hears at one time about the death of his father and his mother, or of the death of two other relatives, he should tear his garments one time for both of them. But if he hears of the death of his father or mother together with the death of another relative, he should first tear his garments for his father or mother, and leave a space of three finger breadths, and make a new tear for the other relative.</p>
<p>12) When a sick person has lost a relative, if his mind is clear [and he realizes his loss] but he is unable to tear his garments because of the seriousness of his illness, he is exempt from tearing his garments after [his recovery], unless he recovered within the <italic>shiva</italic> period, which is still considered a time of intense grief. If, however, he was unable to tear his garments because his mind was not clear, then when he regains his clarity of mind and realizes his loss which is then <italic>&#x201C;his&#x201D;</italic> time of intense grief, he must tear his garments if it is within the thirty days of mourning [for relatives]; but for the death of a parent, there is no time limit.</p>
<p>13) If a child [a minor] lost a relative, even if the child has not yet reached the age of <italic>chinuch</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1293">8</xref></sup> his garments should be slightly torn for him, to manifest sorrow and mourning. But if he has already reached the age of <italic>chinuch</italic>, it is a mitzvah for him to tear his garments like an adult.</p>
<p>14) When death occurs on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>, it is the custom in these areas,<sup><xref rid="fn1294">9</xref> <xref rid="fn1295">10</xref></sup> to tear the garments only for father or mother, whether it is the day of burial or the day when he heard even delayed news of their death.<sup><xref rid="fn1296">11</xref></sup> However, if his father or mother died on Yom Tov, since the tearing of the garments had been postponed, he should not tear them on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>, [but wait] until after Yom Tov when the period of mourning begins. But for all other relatives, the garments are not torn on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>, until after the Yom Tov. However, if he heard on <italic>Chol Hamoed, current news</italic> of their death, which will become <italic>delayed news</italic> if he waits till after Yom Tov, in such an instance, he should tear his garments on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1286">1. II Samuel 13:31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1287">2. The custom among certain &#x201C;liberated&#x201D; Jews to pin a black cloth on their garment and to tear it instead of the actual garment, certainly does not meet the requirements of Jewish law.</ftnote>

In places where there is no established custom, the garments should be torn for all relatives. (See <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 547:17, 16, 11.)</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 196 The Laws Of An Onein<xref rid="fn1297">&#x002A;</xref> Regarding Weekdays, Shabbos And Yom Tov.</title>
<p>1) When a person suffers the loss [death] of a relative for whom he is obligated to observe the ritual mourning,<sup><xref rid="fn1298">1</xref></sup> he is considered an <italic>onein</italic> until after the burial.<sup><xref rid="fn1299">2</xref></sup> An <italic>onein</italic> must avoid [all kinds of] levity, lest his conduct lead people to say that the deceased was a worthless person, and therefore he is not bothered about his burial, and his mourning, and is not concerned about his death. This is a tremendous disgrace to the deceased, and such a person is included among those &#x201C;Who ridicule the poor.&#x201D; Rather he should manifest to all that he is distressed and concerned about the deceased and his burial. He should not eat in the room where the deceased lies, but in another room. If there is no other room, he should eat in his neighbor&#x2019;s house. If he has no neighbor, he should put up a partition in front of the deceased, that is at least ten <italic>tefachem</italic> high,<sup><xref rid="fn1300">3</xref></sup> and the open space below [the partition] should be less than three tefachim. It should be strong enough to resist the wind. If he has no material with which to make a partition, he should turn his face aside and eat. Under all circumstances, and even if he happens to be in another city, he should not have an elaborate meal, but only a simple snack, and he must not eat meat or drink wine.</p>
<p>2) An <italic>onein</italic> is exempt<sup><xref rid="fn1301">4</xref></sup> from all mitzvos of the Torah, even if it is not necessary for him to be occupied with the arrangements for the deceased, as he has others to do so in his behalf. Even if he wants to be stringent [and perform mitzvos] he is not permitted to do so,<sup><xref rid="fn1302">5</xref></sup> out of respect to the deceased.<sup><xref rid="fn1303">6</xref></sup> He should not say the <italic>berachah</italic> of <italic>Hamotzei</italic> on bread nor recite <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> after eating. Even if others eat and recite <italic>berachos</italic>, he should not respond <italic>Amein</italic> [to their <italic>berachos</italic>]. He cannot be included in a quorum of three for <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>, or in quorum of ten (a <italic>minyan</italic>) for prayers. However, prohibitory mitzvos, even those enacted by the Sages, are forbidden even to an <italic>onein</italic>. Therefore if he wants to eat bread, he must wash his hands, but he must not say the <italic>berachah, Al Netilas Yadayim</italic>, just as he must not say the <italic>Hamotzi</italic>. Regarding the washing of hands upon arising in the morning, he should wash his three times as customary but without saying the <italic>berachah</italic>.</p>
<p>3) If the <italic>onein</italic> had eaten before the burial, and after the burial, the food was not yet digested, he should say <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>. Similarly, if he had gone to the toilet before the burial, he should say the <italic>berachah, Asher Yatzar</italic>, at anytime during the whole day.</p>
<p>4) If the <italic>onein</italic> is in another city, and there are relatives in the city where the dead lies, and they too are obligated to observe the rules of mourning, then the one who is in the other city, is not considered an <italic>onein</italic>. However if there are no relatives where the dead lies, he assumes all the laws of an <italic>onein</italic>.</p>
<p>5) In a place where there is a Burial Society, after the relatives have made arrangements for the burial with the burial society and have come to terms with them, they have nothing further to do since the members of the Burial Society will do everthing. Then the relatives are not subject to the laws of <italic>onein</italic>, and they are permitted to eat meat and to drink wine. They are certainly permitted, even obligated, to recite <italic>Kerias Shema</italic> and <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>, and to observe all the <italic>mitzvos</italic>. Nevertheless, it is customary for the <italic>oneinin</italic> not to pray until after the burial, because they too follow and accompany the deceased to the cemetery. If he [the <italic>onein</italic>] wishes to be stringent and pray immediately after handing over the deceased to the Burial Society, he may be stringent [and do so].</p>
<p>6) So long as the deceased is not buried, the <italic>onein</italic> does not remove his shoes, and is permitted to leave the house to make arrangements for the burial. However, he is forbidden to sit or sleep on a chair or bed. He is certainly forbidden to have marital relations. He is forbidden to bathe, to annoint himself, to participate in joyous events, to greet people, to have his hair cut, and to study Torah. He is forbidden to work, or even allow others to do work for him, even where a loss is involved. Where the loss would be substantial, he should consult a <italic>Poseik</italic>.</p>
<p>7) If a person is an <italic>onein</italic>, when it is time to recite <italic>Krias Shema</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1304">7</xref></sup> and <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>, and by the time the burial is finished, a fourth of the day will have passed, (which is the time limit for saying <italic>Krias Shema</italic>), he may say <italic>Kerias Shema</italic> and its <italic>berachos</italic> without Tefillin until the third of the day. If a third of the day had passed before the burial he may still say <italic>Kerias Shema</italic>, [but] without its <italic>berachos</italic>. [However] the prayer of <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic> may be said until midday; and the <italic>Musaph</italic> service of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> may be said even later, for it may be said the entire day. Of the morning <italic>berachos</italic> he should say only three: &#x201C;Who did not make me a gentile,&#x201D; &#x201C;Who did not make me a slave,&#x201D; &#x201C;Who not make me a woman.&#x201D; He should also say the <italic>berachos</italic> over the Torah as they may be said the entire day. The other <italic>berachos</italic> should not be said after their time has passed, since at the proper time, which is the morning, he was exempt. If the deceased was buried before a third of the day, and his house is far away from the cemetery, so that by the time he reaches his house, a third of the day will have passed, it is best that he should enter a house near the cemetery, to say <italic>Kerias Shema</italic> and <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic>, at the proper time, or he may do so even in the open in a clean place. As soon as they begin to throw earth on the body, he may recite the <italic>Kerias Shema</italic> and <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic> even though the period of mourning has not yet begun.<sup><xref rid="fn1305">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>8) If the death occured, and he became an <italic>onein</italic> after the time for the <italic>Shacharis</italic> prayers, or after the time for the <italic>Mincha</italic> or <italic>Maariv</italic> prayers, and he had not prayed before he became an <italic>onein</italic>, and he remained an <italic>onein</italic> until after the time of prayer had passed, nevertheless, he need not make up for them by reciting the <italic>Shemoneh Esrei</italic> twice in the next prayer.<sup><xref rid="fn1306">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>9) If death occurs on Shabbos, since it is forbidden to bury him on that day, the mourner is not restricted by the laws of <italic>onein</italic>, and is permitted to eat meat and to drink wine, He must fulfil all the mitzvos,<sup><xref rid="fn1307">10</xref></sup> except that of having marital relations which is forbidden to him. He is also forbidden to study Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn1308">11</xref></sup> because these two are private activities. If he is the Chazzan of the synagogue, and there is someone else to lead the prayers, he should not lead the prayers. If there is no one else, he may lead the prayers. If the deceased is his father or his mother, he may say the <italic>Kaddish</italic>, if there are no other mourners, but if there are other mourners, he should not say <italic>Kaddish</italic> before the burial.<sup><xref rid="fn1309">12</xref></sup> If the <italic>onein</italic> had already been in mourning for his father or his mother, or if he was observing <italic>Yahrtseit</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1310">13</xref></sup> he may recite <italic>Kaddish</italic>, as any other mourner or <italic>Yahrtseit</italic> observer.</p>
<p>10) Towards evening (Saturday night) he should say <italic>Kerias Shema</italic> without its <italic>berachos</italic>, but he does not pray <italic>Maariv</italic>, nor does he recite the <italic>Havdalah</italic> for <italic>Motzi Shabbos</italic>. He is permitted to eat without saying <italic>Havdalah</italic>. After the burial, he should say <italic>Havdalah</italic> with a cup of wine. Even if the burial is on Sunday, he may say <italic>Havdalah</italic> with a cup of wine, but without saying the <italic>berachos</italic> over the candle and the spices; because it is permitted to say <italic>Havdalah</italic> until Tuesday (as stated in Chapter 96 above). If he prays <italic>Shacharis</italic> before the time has passed for saying <italic>Havdalah</italic>, he need not say <italic>&#x201C;Attah Chonantanu&#x201D;</italic> in the <italic>Shemneh Esrei</italic>.</p>
<p>11) If towards evening it is necessary for the mourner to walk from his house to the Shabbos boundary line in order to go immediately after Shabbos to a place to attend to matters concerning the deceased, or if towards evening he needs to gather together the officers of the Burial Society to negotiate the price of the grave, then as soon as begins to walk and to engage in arrangements in behalf of the deceased, he becomes an <italic>onein</italic>.</p>
<p>12) If the death occured <italic>erev</italic> Shabbos before <italic>Minchah</italic>, when it was impossible to bury him before Shabbos, the mourner must even pray <italic>Minchah erev</italic> Shabbos.</p>
<p>13) If the death occured on the first day of Yom Tov, and the mourner wants to bury him on that day using the services of non-Jews, he immediately becomes subject to the laws of <italic>onein</italic>. This is certainly true when death occurs on the second day of Yom Tov, when the mourner himself is permitted to bury him. He immediately becomes subject to the laws of <italic>onein</italic>, even if he does not intend to bury him on that day.<sup><xref rid="fn1311">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>14) If his dead<sup><xref rid="fn1312">15</xref></sup> lies before him on the night of the second day of Yom Tov, when the custom of the community is to bury the deceased using the services of Jews, the mourner is subject to the laws of <italic>onein</italic> even at night. He therefore should not recite <italic>Kiddush</italic>, nor should he eat meat or drink wine.<sup><xref rid="fn1313">16</xref></sup> However, on the night of the first day of Yom Tov, or even on the night of the second day of Yom Tov, when the custom of the community is that even on the second day of Yom Tov, burial is made only through the services of non-Jews, the mourner is not subject to the laws of <italic>onein</italic> at night.</p>
<p>15) If one is an <italic>onein</italic> at the conclusion of Yom Tov, he may recite <italic>Havdalah</italic> on the day after [Yom Tov,] but not after that, because the proper time for <italic>Havdalah</italic> after Yom Tov, is only until the end of the day after Yom Tov.</p>
<p>16) If an <italic>onein</italic> has a son that must be circumcised, and it is possible to bury the deceased before the men leave the synagogue after the <italic>Shacharis</italic> prayers, those who are involved in the burial should first pray <italic>Shacharis</italic>, then bury the deceased, and the child is then circumcised. If that is impossible, the child should nevertheless be circumcised in the morning at the synagogue, and the <italic>sandeik</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1314">17</xref></sup> should say the <italic>berachah</italic>, <italic>&#x201C;Lehachniso,&#x201D;</italic> because circumcision has preference over burial.</p>
<p>17) If a person is an <italic>onein</italic> on the night of the fourteenth day of <italic>Nisan</italic>, he should appoint an agent to search for <italic>chametz</italic>, but he himself should recite, &#x201C;<italic>Kol Chamirah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1315">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>18) If a person is an <italic>onein</italic> on a night when the <italic>omer</italic> is counted, he should not count at night, rather on the following day after the burial, he should count the <italic>omer</italic> without a <italic>berachah</italic>. [However], on the following nights, he may count the <italic>omer</italic> with a <italic>berachah</italic>. If he sees during the day that he will retain the status of an <italic>onein</italic> until night, he may count the <italic>omer</italic> even while he is an <italic>onein</italic> but without a <italic>berachah</italic>, so that on the following nights he may count the <italic>omer</italic> with a <italic>berachah</italic></p>
<p>19) If a man dies in prison, and the warden refuses to release the body for burial unless he is given a large sum of money, the relatives are not subject to the laws of <italic>onein</italic>, nor are they subject to the laws of mourning, since they have not despaired of being able to bury him and hope to reach an agreement with the warden. Likewise, if the relatives of the deceased are in prison, and are unable to tend the needs of the deceased [burial etc.] they are not subject to the laws of <italic>onein</italic>.</p>
<p>20) In countries where the law forbids burial of the dead until after forty-eight hours, nevertheless, the <italic>onein</italic> is still subject to the laws of <italic>onein</italic>. Since at the end of the forty-eight hours time limit, they will definitely bury him, they [the relatives] must in the meantime be occupied in the honor of the deceased; to prepare shrouds, and a coffin, and to engage men of the Burial Society. However, on the second day of Yom Tov, there is a leniency, and they may be exempt from the laws of <italic>onein</italic>, since it is impossible to bury the dead [anyway] because of the civil law.</p>
<p>21) In the above mentioned places, since the relatives are concerned that they may not find men to cleanse the body once forty-eight hours have passed since the death, and therefore they had the body cleansed immediately after death, and had it placed in a coffin having holes at the bottom; then in such a case, as soon as it is placed in the coffin, they are exempt from the laws of <italic>onein</italic>, and they begin to observe the laws of mourning. Nevertheless, they must count the seven days of mourning from the time the grave is closed.</p>
<p>22) If a death occured, and the relative is unaware of it, if there is no one else to arrange the burial, he should be told. If there are others to arrange the burial, he should not be told, until after he has concluded his prayers. If one&#x2019;s wife lost a relative, and she is unaware of it, the husband should be strict, and abstain from marital relations with her.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1297">&#x002A; An <italic>Onein</italic> is a mourner prior to the burial of his relative.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1301">4. The period of <italic>onein</italic> lasts until the deceased has been covered with earth.

<ftnote id="fn1302">5. If he said <italic>Kerias Shema</italic> etc. while he was an <italic>onein</italic>, he did not fulfil his obligation and must repeat his prayers after the burial (Ibid 71:3).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1304">7.

<title>Chapter 197 The Laws of the Shrouds, and Purification. The Prohibition of Deriving Pleasure from Belongings of the Deceased.</title>
<p>1) It is a custom of respect to make garments of white linen for shrouds.<sup><xref rid="fn1316">1</xref></sup> They should be made nicely to indicate our belief in the resurrection of the dead, for Rav Chiya bar Yosef said, &#x201C;The righteous will arise with their garments on them.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1317">2</xref></sup> However they should not be too elaborate, for that is forbidden. One should not make the shrouds with a hem, or a knot of any sort, either when sewing the shrouds or when dressing the deceased with them. A man should be buried in a <italic>tallis</italic> with <italic>tzitzis</italic> [fringes], but one [of the four <italic>tzitzis</italic>] should be invalidated. The better procedure however is to insert one of the <italic>tzitzis</italic> in a corner pocket of the <italic>tallis</italic> when the body is in the grave. If he had a beautiful <italic>tallis</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1318">3</xref></sup> in which he prayed during his lifetime, it is not proper to exchange it after his death with a <italic>tallis</italic> that is not as beautiful, for a person is desirous of being buried in the <italic>tallis</italic> in which he prayed during his lifetime.<sup><xref rid="fn1319">4</xref></sup> When dressing the deceased, they should think: &#x201C;Just as his body is being clothed, so may his soul be attired in spiritial garments in <italic>Gan Eiden</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>2) The purification of the body is done in this manner: His entire body and head is washed with warm water. He should be thoroughly cleansed between his fingers and toes, as well as all other parts of his body. His head should be shampooed, his hair should be combed and trimmed, and his finger and toe nails should be cut (it is not the custom to do so in our countries). Care should be taken not to place the deceased with his face downwards as that is disrespectful, rather he should be inclined on one side, and then on the other side. After he is thoroughly cleansed, we pour nine <italic>kavvim</italic> of water over him. This is done in the following manner: The deceased is placed in a standing position on the ground, or on straw, and the water is poured on his head, so that it runs down his entire body.</p>
<p>3) Regarding the capacity of nine <italic>kavvim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1320">5</xref></sup> there are diverse opinions (It is best to take about twenty four quarts, one liter according to the Polish measurements.) It is not necessary that all the water be contained in one vessel; but even two or three vessels can be combined to make up nine <italic>kavvim</italic>. It is however necessary that the second vessel be poured before the first is emptied, and the third one be poured before the second is emptied. Even when pouring from one vessel, the flow must not be interrupted. However, four vessels, even if they are poured simultaneously, cannot be combined.</p>
<p>4) Afterwards, an egg is beaten with wine. The egg is beaten together with its shell, to symbolize that fortune is like a revolving wheel in the world. (Where wine is not available water may be used.) The head of the deceased is washed with this mixture. The custom in some places that each one takes a little of the mixture and sprinkles it upon the deceased is improper, and the custom should be abolished because it resembles the customs of the gentiles. Rather it should be used only to wash his head.</p>
<p>5) Care should be taken that the fingers of the deceased do not remain closed. The custom in some places to close his fingers, should be abolished. The belief of those who say that by doing so, they symbolize sacred names, is a mere fabrication. Similarly the custom of placing twigs in his hand generally called forks, is a foolish custom.<sup><xref rid="fn1321">6</xref></sup> If they insist on placing them, they should be put alongside the deceased.</p>
<p>6) After the deceased has been cleansed he should not be left in the place where the purification took place, but should be placed opposite the door inside the house. One should not turn over the board upon which the deceased has been washed, for it may be dangerous to do so.</p>
<p>7) A parent should not kiss his dead children, as it is very dangerous. All the more so, one should not grasp the hand of the deceased and say that he should take him along.</p>
<p>8) When the deceased is being taken from the house, care must be exercised that no one should walk out ahead of him. The pallbearers, however, who must exit the house first, in order to carry him out, need not be concerned about this.</p>
<p>9) If a person collapses and dies instantly, if his body was injured, and blood flowed from the wound, and there is reason to fear that perhaps his lifeblood was absorbed in his clothes and his shoes, he should not be ritually cleansed, but he should be buried in his clothing and his shoes. Over his clothing, he should be wrapped in a sheet. The sheet is called <italic>soveir</italic>, (wrapping). It is customary to scoop up the earth from the spot where he fell, if any blood is there. The earth nearby that spot should also be dug up, and he should be buried with all the earth that contains blood. Only the clothing he wore when he fell should be buried with him, but if the blood splashed on other garments that he was not wearing at that time, or if he was placed upon pillows and cushions while still bleeding, these need not be buried but should be thoroughly washed until no trace of blood remains. The water is then poured into his grave. If he did not bleed, his clothing should be removed, his body ritually cleansed, and dressed in shrouds as is done in cases of natural death. Likewise, the clothing of a person who drowned in water should be removed, and he should be treated as one who died a natural death. In some places, it is customary to bury those who drowned with the clothing in which they were found. Where this is the custom it should be upheld.</p>
<p>10) Even if blood issued from his body but it stopped, and his clothes were removed, after which he lived for a few days and died, his body must be ritually cleansed and dressed in shrouds. Even though his body is stained from the blood which issued from him, he still must be cleansed, because we are not concerned [about washing off the blood] that issued when he was alive. We are concerned only about the blood which issued from him while he was dying because it may have been his lifeblood, or that his lifeblood was mixed with it.</p>
<p>11) If a woman dies while giving birth, we apply to her the same law as that of a slain person, and if it is known that she had lost a great deal of blood, she is not to be cleansed. If the flow of blood had ceased and she died later, in which case there is no doubt about lifeblood, she should be treated as any other person who died naturally. In many communities, it is the custom to cleanse the body of any woman who dies at childbirth. There are many other customs pertaining to a woman who dies at childbirth; where they prevail they should be observed.</p>
<p>12) One who is murdered by a non-Jew, even if he did not bleed at all, for example if he was strangled to death, he should be buried as he was found, in order to arouse wrath against the killer.</p>
<p>13) The deceased, whether gentile or Jew, and his shrouds, are forbidden to be used for any benefit. Also ornaments of the dead that are attached to his body, such as a wig that is tied to, or woven into his hair, are forbidden to be used for any benefit. Also, if he has an artificial tooth, it should be buried with him, but ornaments that are not attached to the body are permitted. Also ornaments that are not considered of the body, such as jewelry and clothing, may be used in any event.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1316">1. Linen is preferable because it deteriorates quickly and therefore does not delay the deterioration of the body. (<italic>Tzelach</italic> to <italic>Maseches Berachos</italic> 28b)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1317">2. <italic>Maseches Kesubos</italic> 11b. However if the deceased was not dressed in shrouds, it is forbidden to open the grave and to dress him. Rather the grave is opened and the shrouds placed on the casket. (<italic>Beir Heitiv</italic> 355)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1318">3. This also applies if he had a beautiful <italic>Kittel</italic> in which he prayed on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1319">4. When an unmarried person dies, who did not pray with a <italic>tallis</italic> in his lifetime, there are various customs regarding dressing him with a <italic>tallis</italic>. If the deceased was a Torah scholar and a God-fearing person, it is the custom in some places to dress him with a <italic>tallis</italic>, while others have the custom to dress him with a <italic>tallis kattan</italic>. (<italic>Mishmeres Sholom</italic> 27)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1320">5. A <italic>Kav</italic> is equal to 24 <italic>Kabeitza</italic> or 16 <italic>Revi&#x2019;is</italic>. See Glossary.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 198 The Removal of the Deceased The Funeral and Burial Services.</title>
<p>1) If a death occurs in town all the inhabitants are forbidden to do work. If there are people in the town appointed to take care of the dead, those whose services are not required, are permitted to work.</p>
<p>2) If a death occurs in a small village, the inhabitants should not exchange greetings; and certainly one should not extend greetings in a cemetery, when the deceased is there, awaiting burial. This applies even in a large city. But if there is no deceased awaiting burial, greetings may be exchanged at a distance of four <italic>amos</italic> from the graves.</p>
<p>3) It is forbidden to allow the deceased to remain overnight, as it is said, &#x201C;You shall not let it remain etc., but you shall surely bury him the same day.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1322">1</xref></sup> To let him remain for his honor, to arrange for a coffin, or shrouds, or to await the arrival of relatives, or eulogizers, is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn1323">2</xref></sup> For the Torah forbids delaying the burial only in such a case as when one is hanged, for it leads to disgrace of the dead, but not when it is for his honor. Likewise, if a corpse was found and his identity has not been established, it is permitted to keep the body until witnesses come, or until his wife comes to identify him.</p>
<p>4) With regard to other relatives who die, the sooner they are brought to their rest the more praiseworthy it is, but in the case of one&#x2019;s father or mother whom he is obligated to eulogize and to mourn abundantly, he who hastens to bring them to rest is despised, unless it is the day before Shabbos, or the day before Yom Tov, or if it is raining on the coffin.</p>
<p>5) If there are two persons awaiting burial, the one who died first should be taken out for burial first, and then the second. After burial of the first one, they should not arrange themselves in rows, nor should they say the <italic>beracha</italic> of mourners, or console the mourners, so as not to delay the burial of the second. If they wish to delay the burial of the first one, in order to do him honor, the burial of the second should not be delayed because of him, but he should be buried immediately.</p>
<p>6) If one of the deceased persons is a Torah scholar, and the other is an ignorant man, the Torah scholar should be taken out for burial first, even though the ignorant man died first. If there is a man and a woman, the woman should be buried first, even if the man died first, for it is written, &#x201C;And Miriam died there, and was buried there,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1324">3</xref></sup> (which means) the burial was immediately after her death.</p>
<p>7) When a person sheds tears over the death of a virtuous person, the Holy One, blessed is He, counts the tears, and stores them in His treasure house.<sup><xref rid="fn1325">4</xref></sup> This is also an atonement for the sin of pollution, and prevents the death of his small children, God forbid.</p>
<p>8) If a person sees the funeral procession, and fails to join the procession, he is guilty of <italic>mocking the poor</italic>, and is deserving of excommunication. He should accompany the dead at least a distance of four <italic>Amos</italic>. Even when one is exempt from accompanying the dead (as in paragraph 9), he, nevertheless, must rise before the procession. He does not rise in deference to the dead, but to those attending to the dead, for they are engaged in performing a mitzvah. This is the law with regard to every mitzvah in which a person is engaged. It is required that all must rise before him; and, therefore, workmen used to rise before those bringing <italic>Bikkurim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1326">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>9) Nowadays, it is assumed that every Jew has studied [some] Scripture and some <italic>Mishnah</italic>. Therefore, when he dies, even the study of Torah must be interrupted in order to participate in his funeral procession. However, for a woman or a child, the custom is to be lenient, and not to interrupt Torah study in order to attend their funeral. School children, should never be interrupted from Torah study. Even for the purpose of building the <italic>Beis Hamikdash</italic>, they must not be interrupted.</p>
<p>10) Great care must be taken that men and women should not mingle together when going to the cemetery and especially upon returning from the cemetery, for this could be dangerous, God forbid.</p>
<p>11) The pallbearers should not wear sandals on their feet (the kind without heels that can easily slip off their feet), but they may wear shoes.</p>
<p>12) At approximately thirty <italic>amos</italic> from the grave the pallbearers should halt with the coffin every four <italic>amos</italic>, so that they can halt seven times. These seven stops are symbolic of the seven <italic>maamados</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1327">6</xref></sup> which are equal to the seven times that <italic>vanity</italic> is mentioned in <italic>Koheles</italic>, and to the seven portals of Gehenom, and to the seven judgements that are passed upon the dead. They should wait a little at each stop, for the delay atones, somewhat, for the dead. On a day that <italic>tachanun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1328">7</xref></sup> is not recited, these halts are not necessary, for on those days the judgement is not that severe.</p>
<p>13) Upon reaching the cemetery, those who have not seen graves in thirty days<sup><xref rid="fn1329">8</xref></sup> must say the <italic>berachah</italic>, &#x201C;<italic>Asher Yatzar Esschem Baddin</italic>&#x201D; etc. (&#x201C;Who has created you in judgement&#x201D;), after which, is said: &#x201C;<italic>Attah Gibbor</italic>&#x201D; (&#x201C;You are mighty&#x201D;) etc. until, &#x201C;<italic>Lehachayos meisim</italic>&#x201D; (&#x201C;To restore the dead to life&#x201D;).</p>
<p>14) Afterwards, <italic>Tzidduk Haddin</italic> is recited, beginning with &#x201C;<italic>Hatzur Tamim Paalo</italic>&#x201D; etc. (&#x201C;The Rock is perfect in His ways&#x201D;). This prayer is begun by one of the mourners. If there is no mourner present, it is begun by the most distinguished person present. On days that <italic>Tachanun</italic> is not said, <italic>Tzidduk Haddin</italic> is not said. Therefore, it is not said on <italic>erev</italic> Shabbos, after midday, and not on <italic>erev</italic> Yom Tov. But on <italic>erev Rosh Chodesh, erev</italic> Chanukah, and <italic>erev</italic> Purim, it is said, even after midday. If the deceased is a Torah scholar, it is also said on <italic>Lag Be&#x2019;omer</italic>, and on the days between <italic>Rosh Chodesh Sivan</italic> and <italic>Shavuos</italic>, on the ninth day of <italic>Av</italic>, and on <italic>erev Rosh Hoshana</italic> before noon.</p>
<p>15) At night, there is no recitation of <italic>Tzidduk Haddin</italic> or <italic>Kaddish</italic> at the cemetery.</p>
<p>16) For an infant less than thirty days old, <italic>Tzidduk Haddin</italic> is not recited.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1322">1. <italic>Deuteronomy</italic> 21:23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1323">2. There are later <italic>Poskim</italic> who maintain that even for the honor of the deceased it is forbidden to delay the burial for more than twenty four hours. <italic>Divrei Malkiel</italic> Volume II 95, <italic>Chamisha Mamuros</italic> folio 129</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 199 Laws of Burial And The Cemetery</title>

<p>1) The burial mentioned in the Torah, means actually placing the body in the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn1330">1</xref></sup> In many places it is customary to place the deceased in a wooden coffin, and he is buried in that manner. Since it is impossible that such a coffin is without holes [at the bottom], it is sufficient to bury him is such a way. In some places the body is buried without a coffin, rather it is placed actually on the earth, without a board underneath, but with one board placed on each side, and one more board on top of them to prevent any dirt from falling upon the body, which would be a dishonor to him. In other communities, ordinary men are buried without a coffin, and only for <italic>kohanim</italic> and firstborn males, who are of special importance, are coffins made. When making a coffin, care must be taken that the remnants of the boards not be used for any other purpose. They should be burned for fuel to heat the cauldron in which water is warmed for the ritual purification of the deceased. Benevolent people, who in their lifetime fed the poor at their table, should be buried in a coffin made of boards from the table, as it is written, &#x201C;And your righteousness shall go before you.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1331">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) The body is laid on its back, its face upward. If the deceased had prepared earth from <italic>Eretz Yisroel</italic>, some of it is spread underneath his body and some on top of it, as it is said &#x201C;And His land shall atone His people.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1332">3</xref></sup> The main place to put this earth is on the &#x201C;holy covenant&#x201D; (of circumcision) and also on his mouth, his eyes, and his hands.</p>
<p>3) Two persons should not be buried close to each other, unless the wall that separates them can stand by itself, and is at least six finger breadths thick. If possible, it is best to be strict, so that the thickness of the separation is six <italic>tefachim</italic>. However, a man or woman may be buried with their son or daughter, or with their grandson or granddaughter. This is the rule: A minor who may sleep with him in his lifetime, may be buried with him after his death. However, an adult son with his father, or an adult daughter with her mother, should not be buried together. Even the burial of a minor [with his parent] is permissible only when they are buried at the same time, but if one of them had already been buried, it is forbidden to bury the other with him.</p>
<p>4) It has been explained in chapter 163:7, that if an uncircumcised infant dies, he should be circumcised at his grave, and a name given to him. A female infant should also be given a name; and the Burial Society must be informed of this law.</p>
<p>5) Two coffins must not be placed one atop the other, unless there is at least six <italic>tefachim</italic> of earth between them.</p>
<p>6) A wicked person should not be buried next to a righteous person, as it is said, &#x201C;Do not gather my soul with sinners.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1333">4</xref></sup> Even a very wicked man, should not be buried next to a less wicked man. Similarly, a righteous man should not be buried, and certainly a man of average piety and virtue, should not be buried next to a man who excelled in saintliness. Two people who hated one another should not be buried next to each other, for even in their death they will have no peace together.</p>
<p>7) One should be mindful of the custom not to take a shovel or a pick axe from the hand of another when burying the dead; rather the one who used it lays it down, and the other picks it up.</p>
<p>8) After the body is laid in the grave, the bier is turned over three times, for the numerical value of the word <italic>mittah</italic> (bed, bier) is the same as that of the word <italic>Din</italic> (judgement). This is an omen that the judgement will be turned into mercy, and the mourning into joy. The verse alludes to this, &#x201C;You turned my mourning into dancing.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1334">5</xref></sup> On a day when <italic>Tachanun</italic> is not said, this is not done.</p>
<p>9) If an orphan is present in the cemetery, then, after the burial, (if it is still day) the people should step away a distance of at least four <italic>amos</italic> from the graves and recite the psalm, <italic>&#x201C;Lamenatzaich&#x201D;</italic> (&#x201C;To the chief musician&#x201D;) etc. <italic>&#x201C;Shimu Zos&#x201D;</italic> (&#x201C;Hear this&#x201D;) etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1335">6</xref></sup> On a day when <italic>Tachanun</italic> is not said, <italic>&#x201C;Michtam Le&#x2019;Dovid&#x201D;</italic> etc. is said.<sup><xref rid="fn1336">7</xref></sup> The orphan then says the <italic>Kaddish</italic>: <italic>&#x201C;D&#x2019;Hu Assid Lehischadetah&#x201D;</italic> (&#x201C;That he will renew&#x201D;), and those present recite with him up to <italic>&#x201C;Vikarei&#x201D;</italic> (And may this happen). In some communities it is customary that the <italic>Kaddish</italic> is recited first before the burial, following <italic>Tzidduk Haddin</italic>. There are communities where even <italic>Tzidduk Haddin</italic> is not said until after the burial.</p>
<p>10) It is customary, upon leaving the cemetery to pluck some grass<sup><xref rid="fn1337">8</xref></sup> and throw it behind your back and say, &#x201C;He is mindful that we are dust.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1338">9</xref></sup> This is also symbolic of the resurrection of the dead, who will emerge living from their dust, as it is said, &#x201C;And may they blossom out of the city like grass of the earth.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1339">10</xref></sup> This may also be done on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1340">11</xref></sup> They should then wash their hands. There is a symbolic allusion to this practice, for this impurity (death) can be purified only by means of these three things: water, ashes of the <italic>Red Cow</italic>, and the hyssop. This handwashing should not be done in a river, but with water poured from a vessel. You should not take the vessel from the hand of another who washed; rather the first one puts it down and the others take it, and the hands should not be wiped. Some say that one should sit down seven times, because of the evil spirits that accompany him, and when one sits, they flee. In some places they are accustomed to sit only three times after they wash their hands, and they say each time: &#x201C;<italic>Vehi Noam</italic>&#x201D; etc. [And may the pleasantness (of our master etc.)]<sup><xref rid="fn1341">12</xref></sup> Even when the burial takes place on Yom Tov they can sit three times, as on the weekdays. It is our custom to be mindful that a person should not enter his house before washing his hands and sitting down. The customs of our ancestors have the validity of Torah law.</p>
<p>11) The deceased should not be brought from a city where there is a cemetery to another city, because it is degrading to transport him from place to place, unless it is from the diaspora to <italic>Eretz Yisroel</italic>, or if they are transporting him to the burial ground of his ancestors. Also, if he had instructed that he should be brought from place to place, it is permissible to do so.</p>
<p>12) It is forbidden to open a grave after it was closed, that is after earth had been placed over the lid of the coffin; but as long as earth has not been placed there, it is permitted to open it for any reason. If for any reason it becomes necessary to remove a body from its grave, a <italic>Poseik</italic> should be consulted.</p>
<p>13) If a grave has been dug, it should not be left open overnight, because there is danger in this. If there is no time to bury the deceased until the following day, the grave must be refilled with earth.</p>
<p>14) It is forbidden to step upon graves because some <italic>Poskim</italic> maintain that it is forbidden to derive benefit from them. However, if you have to visit a certain grave, and have no way of getting there unless you step upon other graves, it is permitted.</p>
<p>15) You may not go to the cemetery,<sup><xref rid="fn1342">13</xref></sup> or within four <italic>amos</italic> of the deceased, or in a room where the deceased lies while wearing <italic>Tefillin</italic> upon your head or <italic>tzitzit</italic> in your garment, for it seems as if you are &#x201C;mocking the poor.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1343">14</xref></sup> But if they<sup><xref rid="fn1344">15</xref></sup> are covered, it is permitted. Likewise, you are not allowed to pray there,<sup><xref rid="fn1345">16</xref></sup> or to recite Psalms, unless it is in honor of the dead.</p>
<p>16) In the cemetery, you should not indulge in levity, out of respect to the dead. This means you may not eat or drink there, or respond to nature&#x2019;s call. And you may not allow cattle to graze there, and not gather the vegetation that grows there. However, if trees are planted in a cemetery and do not grow over the graves, it is permitted to pick their fruit.</p>
<p>17) It is customary in some communities not to put up a tombstone until after twelve months, because a tombstone is a mark of distinction, and within these twelve months the deceased is in grief. Also, because the reason for putting up a tombstone is so that the dead not be forgotten, and, as a rule, the deceased is not forgotten until after twelve months. There are communities where no heed is paid to this custom.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1330">1. Cremation of the body is forbidden and those who ask to be cremated are considered transgressors and heretics as they deny the resurrection. Their ashes are forbidden to be interred in a Jewish cemetery and there should be no mourning over them. (See <italic>Yora Deiah</italic> 345:5)</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 200 Laws of Burial on Yom Tov</title>
<p>1) If the deceased awaits burial on the first day of (Yom Tov,) a Jew is not allowed to bury him. Even if it is impossible to have it done by non-Jews, and there is concern that decay might set in before the next day, nevertheless, a Jew may not bury him on the first day of Yom Tov. But if it is possible to have non-Jews bury him, that is to have non-Jews dig the grave, and cut the wooden planks, or make the coffin, where it is customary, and sew the shrouds if necessary; then dressing him, heating the water, washing him, removing him, and placing him into the grave, are permitted to be done by a Jew.<sup><xref rid="fn1346">1</xref></sup> Covering him with earth must also be done only by non-Jews. If possible, care should be taken to cleanse and purify him without using a cloth, in order not to wring out the water.</p>
<p>2) Some <italic>Poskim</italic> say, if it is possible to have the burial performed by non-Jews, as stated above, it is forbidden to keep the body till the next day in order that Jews may attend to it. And even if he died that day, and his body could be kept till the next day without decay setting in, nevertheless, he should be buried that day by non-Jews. In the case of an infant who died, even if he lived for more than thirty days, whereby we know that he is not an aborted fetus, nonetheless, if the weather is cold and it is not a dishonor to keep him, as he has not become malodorous, he should not be buried on the first day of Yom Tov, but should be kept until the second day of Yom Tov. Some say, even in the case of an adult, if he has not become malodorous, his burial should be delayed until the second day of Yom Tov. In a place where there is no fixed custom, it is proper to follow the latter opinion.</p>
<p>3) On the second day of Yom Tov, even the second day of <italic>Rosh Hoshana</italic>, if it is possible to accomplish the above mentioned things without delay through non-Jews. they should be done by non-Jews. The other things should be done by Jews, as was previously stated. The purification may be performed with cloths and sheets, but care must be taken not to wring the water out of them directly. If it is impossible to have those other things done by non-Jews, Jews may attend to all his needs as though it were a weekday, because the second day of <italic>Yom Tov</italic>, with reference to the dead, was regarded by the Sages as a weekday. Nevertheless, if someone in that area had previously prepared shrouds for themselves, those shrouds should be used in order to avoid the need of sewing. It is permitted to attend his needs only when they intend to bury him on that day. But if they do not intend to bury him on that day, no preparations should be made for his burial; and it is even forbidden to handle the body.</p>
<p>4) The Sages considered the second day of Yom Tov as a weekday, with regard to the dead in order to honor the dead and not permit him to lie in disgrace. However, to do anything unconnected to his burial is forbidden. Therefore, it is forbidden to negotiate with the shopkeeper about the price of linen for the shrouds, unless it is impossible to obtain it otherwise, as when it can be bought from a non-Jew. Jewish gravediggers are forbidden to accept renumeration for their work on a Yom Tov, because wages for work done on Shabbos or Yom Tov are forbidden. If they refuse to work without pay, they may be paid, but they will have to face the judgement of the Heavenly Court. The Burial Society should not take money for the grave on Yom Tov, but they may accept pledges (collateral) without stipulating the price of the grave.</p>
<p>5) If there is no Jewish cemetery in town, although there is a place where this deceased can be buried, nevertheless, it is permitted to take him to another city on the first day of Yom Tov, by a non-Jew, and on the second day of Yom Tov, even by a Jew, in order to bury him in a Jewish cemetery. But if the burial will not take place on that day, it is forbidden for a Jew to move him on Yom Tov in order to bury him after Yom Tov.</p>
<p>6) It is permitted to accompany the deceased within the <italic>t&#x2019;chum</italic>, on the first day of Yom Tov, and on the second day of Yom Tov, even outside the <italic>t&#x2019;chum</italic>. It is also permitted to return home on that very day. However, it is forbidden to ride upon an animal in order to accompany the dead on Yom Tov, even on the second day of Yom Tov. Even the mourners are not permitted. If it is impossible for the gravediggers to go by foot, they are permitted to ride on an animal on the second day of Yom Tov. Nevertheless, they should not ride in the city.</p>
<p>7) If one dies on the night of the second day of Yom Tov, when it is permitted for Jews to attend to the burial if there are no non-Jews to do so, ten men should rise in the morning and bury him at the time the <italic>Chazan</italic> recites the <italic>Piyutim</italic> [festival hymns]. If he was a distinguished person, so that a multitude of people are obligated to accompany him, he should be buried after people leave the synagogue before the meal is eaten, for the Midrash states, &#x201C;(It is written) &#x2018;You shall not eat with the blood&#x2019; (which signifies) that it is forbidden to eat a regular meal before the deceased is buried.&#x201D; If it is impossible to make all the preparations for the burial by that time, he should be buried after the meal.</p>
<p>8) If an infant dies after thirty days, so that it is certain that it is not an abortive fetus, the same law applies to him as to an adult. However, if he is a male, and for some reason he was not yet circumcised, even though decay is setting in, he should not be buried on the first day of Yom Tov, because his foreskin must be removed, (as stated above, Chapter 163:7) and that cannot be done by a non-Jew. Rather it should be held over until the second day of Yom Tov, for it is permitted to delay [the burial] for his honor; and on the second day, his foreskin should be removed, and he should be buried.</p>
<p>9) If an infant dies and there is doubt if it is an abortive fetus, if decay has not yet set in, it may not be buried on the first day of Yom Tov, even by a non-Jew, and it is held over till the second day of Yom Tov, and then buried by a non-Jew, and not by a Jew. If decay has set in, it should be buried on the first day of Yom Tov by a non-Jew. If it died on the second day of Yom Tov, it should be buried on that very day by a non-Jew and not by a Jew. If he is a male, and was not yet circumcised, even if decay has set in, he should not be buried even on the second day of Yom Tov and not even by a non-Jew, but he should be held over until after Yom Tov. His foreskin should then be removed, and he should be buried.</p>
<p>10) On Shabbos and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, it is not permitted to attend the dead in any way, even by means of a non-Jew.</p>
<p>11) On <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>, the deceased should not be brought to the cemetery before the grave is ready, so that it is not necessary for the bier to remain waiting.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1346">1. Many earlier <italic>poskim</italic> (<italic>Rishonim</italic>) disagree with this ruling. They maintain that since the major part of the burial will be done through non-Jews, it is best to have them do everything. This is also the opinion of <italic>Radvaz</italic> and the <italic>Gra</italic>. See <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 526:12.</ftnote>
<p>Please note <italic>Igros Moshe, Orach Chaim</italic>, Responsa 76. In America, one should not make a funeral on the second day of Yom Tov. One must not do anything without consultation with a competent Rav.</p>

<title>Chapter 201 The Laws of Suicide and the Wicked</title>
<p>1) A person who commits suicide is unsurpassed in wickedness, as it is said, &#x201C;However of the blood of your souls, I will demand an account.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1347">1</xref></sup> The world was created for a single person, (to indicate that) anyone who destroys one Jewish life is considered to have destroyed a whole world.<sup><xref rid="fn1348">2</xref></sup> He should, therefore, not be attended in any way. Garments should not be torn for him, he should not be mourned, nor should he be eulogized. However, he should be buried, ritually purified and dressed in shrouds. The rule is: anything that is done out of respect to the living, should be done for him.<sup><xref rid="fn1349">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) Without proof to the contrary, a man is not presumed to be wicked. Therefore, if a person if found asphyxiated, hanged, or the like, so long as it is possible to assume that he was murdered, it should not be considered a suicide.</p>
<p>3) A minor who committed suicide is considered like one who had taken his life unintentionally. Similarly, an adult who committed suicide, and it appears he did so because of severe depression, or madness, and the like, it is considered unintentional. Similarly, if he did so under duress, because he was afraid of torture, like King Saul, who feared what the Philistines might do to him, he is like any other deceased person, and nothing should be withheld from him.</p>
<p>4) All those who separate themselves from the ways of the community, such as those people who have cast off the yoke of <italic>mitzvos</italic> from themselves, and do not include themselves among the Jewish people with regard to observance of the <italic>mitzvos</italic>, but are like a liberated sect of their own; for all these, including apostates, informers, and heretics, the laws of <italic>Onein</italic> are not observed, and their death is not mourned. Their brothers and other relatives dress in white and adorn themselves in white, eat, drink, and rejoice that the enemies of the Almighty have perished. Concerning such people, the Scripture says,<sup><xref rid="fn1350">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;Behold those who hate you Adonoy, I hate&#x201D; also it is said, &#x201C;When the wicked perish there is joy.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1351">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>5) If one was executed either by the government or otherwise, even if he was an apostate, his relatives should mourn over him. For since he was killed by man and did not die naturally, he had an atonement.</p>
<p>6) If the deceased was an habitual sinner whose sins were motivated by lustful desire, and he made no confession before his death, mourning should not be observed for him. But if he did confess, he should be mourned, even if he had been a thief or a robber.</p>
<p>7) In the case of a child, one or two years old, who was converted<sup><xref rid="fn1352">6</xref></sup> with his father or with his mother, and died, no mourning should be observed for him.</p>

<title>Chapter 202 The Laws Of Defilement Of A Kohein</title>
<p>1) The <italic>Kohein</italic> is commanded not to defile himself through any form of contact with the deceased. Even an abortive fetus, whose limbs have not yet been connected with ligamentous tissue, is considered in this regard as a dead body. (If, however, the abortion occurred within forty days from conception, it is considered like water). The dead body need not be in its entirety, for this law applies even to things that have separated from the corpse such as blood and the like. He is also forbidden to defile himself through contact with the severed limb of a living person, if there is enough flesh on it that were it still connected, it would have possibly healed. Even if it is his own limb, he is forbidden to defile himself by touching it. A <italic>Kohein</italic> is forbidden to enter a house where a person is close to death, and even though a <italic>gosseis</italic> (dying person) is considered alive with regard to everything else, and he is not considered impure, nevertheless, the <italic>Kohein</italic> [by entering such a house] violates the command, &#x201C;You shall not desecrate,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1353">1</xref></sup> for he is commanded to guard his priesthood so that it does not become profaned, and the <italic>gosseis</italic> may die at any moment.</p>
<p>2) A <italic>Kohein</italic> is forbidden to enter a dwelling where there is a dead body, even if the dwelling is very large. Even if there are two rooms, and there is a dead body in one of them, and in the wall that separates them, there is a hole one <italic>tefach</italic> square, he is forbidden to enter even the second room, because the hole of one <italic>tefach</italic> square conducts the impurity into the second room. Likewise, if next to the second room, there is yet a third room, and between them, too, there is a hole one <italic>tefach</italic> square, the impurity passes also to the third room, and so ad infinitum. If the hole was made to admit light, even if it is only the size of a small coin, the impurity passes through.</p>
<p>3) Therefore, in our regions, where the roofs project towards the outside with a width of no less than one <italic>tefach</italic>, and since we know that the width of one <italic>tefach</italic> conveys impurity, this projecting roof is considered a tent which conveys impurity. Hence, when two houses are close to each other, if the deceased is in one of them, the impurity passes through the door, or open window, beneath the ends of the projecting rooftop, and enters into the second house, through the open window or door. Thus the <italic>Kohein</italic> is forbidden to enter even the second house. This is true even if there are many houses closely adjoining one another.</p>
<p>4) Even if the roofs are not of the same height, but one is higher than the other, even if the roof of the house where the impurity is found is much higher than the second roof or vice versa, there is a <italic>halachah</italic> handed down by Moshe from [Mount] Sinai, that the height is considered as lowered, that is, we consider as though the height was pressed down and lowered until it reaches the lower one. And since if it were lowered to the level of the bottom one, they would touch, therefore, the impurity passes from one to the other. But if there would be a space between them, even if ever so small, the impurity does not pass from one to the other.</p>
<p>5) Similarly if a beam lies across an alley as is done for a <italic>eiruv</italic>, (and) is a <italic>tefach</italic> wide, and is covered by the roofs projecting above it to the extent of <italic>tefach</italic> on each side. (Like this:)</p>
<p><img src="images/Art_P1.jpg" alt="art"/></p>
<p>In such a case, the impurity passes from underneath the roof to underneath the beam, which conveys the impurity to underneath the roof of the house on the opposite side. From there it spreads to any place where there is a dwelling no less than one <italic>tefach</italic> wide, until it reaches a barrier or open space. Also, if between the two houses, there is an arch constructed on the style of a court entrance, like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/Art_P2.jpg" alt="art"/></p>
<p>the same law applies. And although the arch has no projecting roof, nevertheless, the impurity is transmitted from beneath the roof to underneath the arch. However, at times an arch is constructed on posts from the ground up, which close up the space between the arch and the walls of the house. Then, if the arch has no projecting roof covering it, and the closed spaces on the sides extend further than the roofs that are above it, in such a case, there is no space through which the impurity may pass, since there is some open space without a tent covering. At times, between the houses there is a solid closed wall without an opening (like this:)</p>
<p><img src="images/Art_P3.jpg" alt="art"/></p>
<p>but there is a projecting roof over it. Then the impurity is conveyed from one roof to another. When necessary, this can be remedied by removing the tiles of the roof in one place to create an interrupting [open] space of a <italic>tefach</italic> wide without a tent. You must be certain that the wall itself does not project a <italic>tefach</italic>, as sometimes they make a projection (to adorn) the wall.</p>
<p>6) There is a <italic>halachah</italic> transmitted to Moshe from Sinai, concerning the door through which the deceased will be carried from the house. Since after the removal the house will again be ritually pure, although the door is now closed, nevertheless according to <italic>halachah</italic>, it is considered as though it is open, and therefore a <italic>Kohein</italic> is forbidden to stand under the lintel, even though the door is closed. Also, if there is a roof projecting a <italic>tefach</italic> over the door, it conveys the impurity to every possible place, as though the door were open. However, if there was an open door or window on another side measuring four square <italic>tefachim</italic>, the closed door is not considered as being open, and a <italic>Kohein</italic> is permitted to stand there provided the impurity cannot reach him through the open door or window.</p>
<p>7) If a <italic>Kohein</italic> is in a house or a room, the doors and windows of which are closed in such manner that the door is not opened a <italic>tefach</italic>, and the window does not have an opening the size of a <italic>pundyon</italic> (coin), and he hears that there is a corpse in the vicinity, so that if the door or window were to be opened, the impurity would reach him, he is forbidden to open either of them, but he should remain there as is, until the deceased is carried out; for so long as there is not an opening of a <italic>tefach</italic>, the impurity cannot penetrate, but when it is opened, it can penetrate.</p>
<p>8) A <italic>kohein</italic> is forbidden to approach within four <italic>amos</italic> of a deceased person or a grave. This applies only when the deceased lies in his permanent place. But when he lies on the bier during the funeral procession, or when they are saying <italic>Tzidduk Haddin</italic>, even when they stop with the bier, since this is not his permanent place, the <italic>Kohein</italic> need keep away only a distance of four <italic>tefachim</italic>.</p>
<p>9) If a <italic>Kohein</italic> is asleep in a house where there is a deceased person, where the impurity of the deceased penetrates, and it is impossible to shut him in, in order to prevent the access of the impurity, he should be awakened and told to leave the premises. If he is undressed, he should not be told about the impurity, but merely called outside so that he may get dressed first; for a person&#x2019;s dignity is very important. However, as soon as he is aware of the impurity, he is forbidden to wait there until he gets dressed, but he must leave immediately.</p>
<p>10) Some <italic>Poskim</italic> maintain that even the corpse of a non-Jew causes impurity in a house. A <italic>Kohein</italic> should be mindful of this opinion and not walk over the grave of a non-Jew. Especially when there is reason to believe that an apostate may have been buried there (too), for an apostate is like a Jew (in this regard). Also the child born by an apostate woman from a non-Jew, is like in Jew in this regard.</p>
<p>11) A <italic>Kohein</italic> is permitted to defile himself at the death of his relatives, and it is a <italic>mitzvah</italic> for him to do so. These are the relatives for which he may defile himself: his wife whom he was permitted to marry, his father, his mother, his son or his daughter, his brother and sister born from his father, provided they were born full term, but for a child who may have been aborted, a <italic>Kohein</italic> may not defile himself. He may not defile himself for a married sister.<sup><xref rid="fn1354">2</xref></sup> Some <italic>Poskim</italic> maintain that which a <italic>Kohein</italic> is permitted and is a <italic>mitzvah</italic> to defile himself for relatives is only for the needs of burial, or to bring a coffin, or shrouds, or the like. Consequently, on Shabbos, a day when he may not be buried, a <italic>Kohein</italic> is forbidden to defile himself even in order to guard the deceased. It is proper to follow this strict opinion. However, concerning things necessary for burial, it is certainly a <italic>mitzvah</italic> for him to defile himself. Even if there is a Burial Society to take care of all the arrangements, and he has nothing to take care of, he is permitted to be in the house in case they might need something. He may defile himself for these relatives only until the grave is closed, and not thereafter.</p>
<p>12) A <italic>Kohein</italic> is forbidden to defile himself for parents who abandoned the practices of the Jewish people, and not for one who committed suicide. Similarly, a <italic>Kohein</italic> is forbidden to defile himself for anyone for whom the rules of mourning need not be observed.</p>
<p>13) A <italic>Kohein</italic> may not defile himself for a relative unless the body is complete but not if it is missing a limb. Therefore some <italic>Poskim</italic> maintain that a <italic>Kohein</italic> may not defile himself for a slain relative, for his body is considered incomplete; and it is proper to heed this strict opinion.</p>
<p>14) Some ignorant <italic>Kohanim</italic> are accustomed to visit the graves of the righteous, maintaining that the graves of the righteous do not defile. They are in error, and such practice should be protested.</p>
<p>15) Just as an [adult] <italic>Kohein</italic> is warned against defiling himself, so too are adult <italic>Kohanim</italic> warned concerning minors, as it is said, &#x201C;Say to the <italic>Kohanim</italic>&#x2026; and say (to them).&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1355">3</xref></sup> Because the word &#x201C;say&#x201D; is written twice, our Sages, of blessed memory,<sup><xref rid="fn1356">4</xref></sup> inferred from this that the adults are warned concerning the minors. They must not be the direct cause of their defilement by bringing them into a house where there is a deceased person, but if the minor defiles himself on his own, there is no need to remove him. However, if he has reached the age of training, he should be removed. The pregnant wife of a <italic>Kohein</italic> is permitted to enter a house containing a corpse.<sup><xref rid="fn1357">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>16) The <italic>Kohanim</italic> cannot force<sup><xref rid="fn1358">6</xref></sup> the relatives of the deceased to hasten the removal of the deceased from its place so that they may enter their homes,<sup><xref rid="fn1359">7</xref></sup> unless the <italic>Kohein</italic> is ill and is unable to leave the house. In that case the relatives are forced to remove the deceased, so as not to cause the sick [<italic>Kohein</italic>] to transgress a law of the Torah. If the deceased is an aborted fetus, its relatives can be forced, in any event, to remove it, even on Shabbos through a non-Jew.</p>

<title>Chapter 203 Relatives and Infants For Whom Mourning Must Be Observed</title>
<p>1) One is obligated to mourn for seven relatives: his father and mother, his son and daughter, his brother and sister, whether from a common father or mother, and even a married sister, a husband for his wife, and a wife for her husband.</p>
<p>2) It is customary for other relatives too, to observe partial mourning during the first week until after Shabbos. It is therefore customary not to bathe in warm water, and not to change their clothing as they do every other Shabbos. Not all relatives are alike in this respect. For a first cousin, a son&#x2019;s son or a daughter&#x2019;s son, one should wear all his Shabbos clothing except for his outer garment. For a father-in-law, a mother-in-law, or for a paternal or maternal grandfather; also a woman for her father-in-law, her mother-in-law, and for her paternal or maternal grandfather, they should wear only a white Shabbos shirt, and a woman may also wear her white scarf. It is also customary not to bathe, and not to shampoo the hair. One should also not eat out of the house at a religious feast or at any social gatherings. After Shabbos, all of these activities are permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn1360">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) When it is not known if a child was born at term or prematurely, if he died within thirty days after birth, or even on the thirtieth day, even if his hair and nails were fully grown, one does not tear his garments for him, nor does he observe the laws of <italic>onein</italic>. Neither does he mourn for him, because it may have been an aborted child. If he died after thirty days, even on the thirty-first day at an earlier hour than that on which he was born, one must tear his garments, observe the laws of <italic>onein</italic>, and mourn over him, unless it is known for sure, that he was born in the eighth month of pregnancy (and is not a viable child). If it was known for sure that he was born in the ninth month, for example, if after cohabitation, the father was separated from his wife, and he was born alive, nine full months later, even if he dies on the day he was born, one must tear his garments, observe the laws of <italic>onein</italic> and mourn over him.</p>
<p>4) If one of twin children dies within thirty days after birth or even on the thirtieth day, and the other survives after thirty days, we do not draw the conclusion, that since one lived after thirty days, the other one, too, was a viable child. Therefore mourning is not observed for him.</p>
<p>5) A male or female proselyte who converted to Judaism with their children, do not observe mourning for one another; for a proselyte is considered like a new-born infant, and their kinship when they were Gentiles is no longer recognized as kinship.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1360">1. All these things depend on the prevailing customs. <italic>Shach</italic> 374:7.</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Chapter 204 When Does The Mourning Period Begin?</title>
<p>1) The mourning period begins from the time the deceased is buried, and the grave is filled with earth. The mourner must remove his shoes at the cemetery. If he has to walk home through a non-Jewish neighborhood, he may wear his shoes, but should place a little earth in them.</p>
<p>2) If the cemetery is close to the city, and the mourner did not go [to the cemetery] but went straight home after the funeral service, he does not observe the laws of mourning until he is told that the grave has been filled. However, if night is approaching and he wants this day counted as one of the seven days of mourning, then, from the time he assumes that the grave was filled, he may begin to observe mourning. If he is informed thereafter that the grave was filled before nightfall, he may count that day as one of the seven, and if it was the day preceding a Festival, the Festival cancels the remainder of the seven days of mourning.</p>
<p>3) In places where the deceased are sent to another city for burial, and they do not know when he will be buried, the mourners who remain in the city should begin to observe the period of mourning immediately upon returning from the funeral, and count from that time the seven days and the thirty days of mourning. The mourners who accompany the deceased to the place of burial count from the time he was buried. Some <italic>poskim</italic> maintain that if the head of the family accompanies the deceased, then also those who remain behind count from the time he was buried. They have to estimate the time he was buried, and begin to observe the laws of mourning. (Regarding the intervening days, See above Chapter 196:5, 6) It is only regarding a more strict application that the other mourners follow the head of the family, and even those who remain at home start counting from the time of burial, but if the head of the family remained at home, those mourners who accompany the deceased are not subject to him, rather they begin to count from the time of the burial.</p>
<p>4) If a person drowned, or was murdered by non-Jews, and his body was not found for burial, so long as the search has not been abandoned, the laws of <italic>onein</italic> and mourning do not apply, and even marital relations are permitted. From the time the search is finally abandoned, they begin to observe the laws of mourning. If, after they finish the period of mourning, the body is found, and brought to burial they need not observe another mourning period. However, if the deceased is his father or mother, he must tear his garments. If a man drowned and left a wife,<sup><xref rid="fn1361">1</xref></sup> and proof of his death is so unsubstantiated<sup><xref rid="fn1362">2</xref></sup> that she cannot be permitted to remarry, mourning should not be observed for him,<sup><xref rid="fn1363">3</xref></sup> and <italic>Kaddish</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1364">4</xref></sup> should not be recited for him. Nevertheless, his kin should try to ease his soul by occasionally leading the prayers at services in the synagogue, by reading the <italic>Haftorah</italic>, by leading the <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1365">5</xref></sup> by giving charity, and by learning Torah, or by hiring someone else to learn Torah in his memory.</p>
<p>5) If a person lost a relative, and he was not there at the time of death but learned about it later at the place where he is, he should count the days of mourning from the time he became aware of it. Even though afterwards he arrives at the place of the deceased, where the other mourners reside, who began their mourning before he did, he must not abreviate his mourning period because of this. Similarly, even if he was not aware of it until he came to the mourners, but the mourners are neither at the place where the death occurred, nor where he was buried, he too, begins to count [the days of mourning] from the time he became aware of it.</p>
<p>6) However if he was not aware of it, until he came to the mourners, and they are at the place where the death occured, or at the place where he was buried, then if at the time of the burial he was near by, that is not further than ten <italic>parasangs</italic>, which is a day&#x2019;s walk, it is considered though he was present at the time of the burial and he counts together with them. Even if he came on the seventh day, before the people leave the Synagogue, since the mourners are still observing some mourning, he counts the seven and thirty days of mourning with them. This is so only when the head of the family is with them, as they all follow him, but if the head of the family is not there, he counts on his own, or if he came from far away, even if the head of the family is there, nevertheless he must count on his own.</p>
<p>7) If a person began counting with the mourners who were present, even if he returns to his home, nevertheless he continues counting with them.</p>
<p>8) The head of the family who is close by does not follow the younger members, but counts on his own.</p>
<p>9) Who is called the head of the family? It is the one whose judgement would be accepted and whose advice everyone would follow, if they were engaged in dividing the inheritance. Even if he is young in years and even if he is not an heir, he is called the head of the family. For example, if the widow is present, and she manages the household, she is called the head of the family. If a person lives with his father-in-law, and his wife dies, his father-in-law is the head of the family.</p>
<p>10) If one becomes aware of the death of his relative after the congregation had prayed the <italic>Maariv</italic> service, but it is still day,<sup><xref rid="fn1366">6</xref></sup> if he has not yet prayed <italic>Maariv</italic>, he is not drawn after the congregation, and he can include that day in his mourning period. If, however, he too had already prayed <italic>Maariv</italic>, that day is not counted, and he must count the seven days of mourning and the thirty days of mourning from the following day. This rule is applied only for stricter observance and not for leniency. Thus if he becomes aware of the death on the thirtieth day after the burial, after he has already prayed <italic>Maariv</italic>, we do not say that it is already night and it is delayed news<sup><xref rid="fn1367">7</xref></sup> to make it lenient for him, but we consider it as day, and thus it is a timely news. Either way this day counts towards the mourning period. With regard to <italic>Tefillin</italic> on the other days, if he heard of the death after he has prayed <italic>Maariv</italic> but it is still daytime, he should put them on the next day without reciting the <italic>berachah</italic> and he should cover them. If this happened on the thirtieth day, he should put on <italic>Tefillin</italic> the following day, and should recite the <italic>berachah</italic> regardless. If a woman heard of the death of a relative, after the congregation prayed the <italic>Maariv</italic> service, but it is still daytime, if she usually does not pray <italic>Maariv</italic>, she is drawn after the congregation for the strict application of the law, and that day is not counted as one of the days of mourning.<sup><xref rid="fn1368">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>11) During a plague, God forbid, it is customary not to observe any mourning, because of the prevailing fear and panic. If the plague passed within thirty days from the day of death, the laws of mourning must be observed. However, if the plague did not pass, until after thirty days from the day of death, or if a Festival had intervened in the meantime, mourning need not be observed.</p>

However, the <italic>Maharam Habib</italic> and <italic>Shach</italic> 375:7 maintain even if he is not married one may not observe the rites of mourning for we fear people will exterpolate from this to other cases and subsequently will permit the wife of such a person to remarry.

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 205 The Meal of Condolence</title>
<p>1) On the first day of mourning, the mourner is forbidden to eat his first meal from his own food. It is a <italic>mitzvah</italic> for his neighbors to send him food for his first meal, which is called the meal of condolence. This meal should begin with eggs or lentils, for they are round and have no mouth, just as the mourner has no mouth (speech). After this course he may eat all foods, even meat. He is permitted to drink a little wine during the meal, in order to help digest the food in his stomach, but not enough to satisfy his desire. (Some <italic>Poskeim</italic> maintain that he is forbidden to eat of his own food the entire first day, even if he eats many meals on that day).</p>
<p>2) If the mourner does not wish to eat that day until nightfall, since the day has passed, he is permitted to eat of his own food. Therefore, if he lives alone in a village, and there is nobody to send him the meal of condolence, it is proper for him to fast until nightfall. Nevertheless, if he cannot fast, he is not obliged to afflict himself, and he may eat of his own food.</p>
<p>3) If a married woman became a mourner, she is forbidden to eat her first meal from her husband&#x2019;s food, for since it is his duty to support her, it is considered as her own food. Similarly, if a hired person works for someone and his meals are part of his wages, and he became a mourner, he should not eat his first meal from his employers&#x2019;s food. However, if a person supports an orphan, or his own grownup son or daughter without any legal commitment to do so, and they became mourners, they may eat their first meal from his food for it is not considered as their own.</p>
<p>4) A woman should not be provided with the condolence meal by men, rather women should provide her with the meal.</p>
<p>5) If the deceased was buried at night and the mourner wishes to eat at night, he is forbidden to eat of his own food, but it must be provided for him by others. If he does not wish to eat that night, he is forbidden to eat his first meal from his own food during the daytime, for since the daytime follows the night, it is still the first day of his mourning.</p>
<p>6) If the burial took place on Friday, after the ninth hour of the day, when it is forbidden to eat a regular meal, he should not be sent the meal of condolence out of respect for the Shabbos and the mourner should eat nothing until the evening.</p>
<p>7) The meal of condolence is sent only to one who received timely news, but it is not sent to one who received delayed news. If one received timely news on Shabbos, the condolence meal is not sent to him for he may eat his own food. Also on the following day (Sunday) the condolence meal is not sent to him, because the need for it was cancelled on the day he received the news.</p>
<p>8) Also, if one&#x2019;s relative dies, and was buried on Yom Tov, the condolence meal is not sent to him. After Yom Tov you also do not send him this meal because the need for it was already cancelled. However, if the burial took place on <italic>Chol Ha&#x2019;moed</italic>, the condolence meal should be sent to him, but he should eat it while sitting on a chair, at the table, in his usual manner, because there is no mourning on <italic>Chol Ha&#x2019;moed</italic>.</p>
<p>9) It was the custom to fast on the day a Torah scholar passed away.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Chapter 206 The Laws of Timely and Delayed News</title>
<p>1) If a person heard of the death of a relative for whom he is obliged to observe mourning, within thirty days of his death or even on the thirtieth day itself, such tidings are timely and he must tear his garments. He is obliged to observe the seven days of mourning from the day he received the news. The thirty days of mourning are also counted from the day he received the news. And the day he received the news is like the day of burial with regard to all its laws. The thirty-day period during which the news is considered timely is counted from the day of burial, and not from the day of death.</p>
<p>2) If he received the news after thirty days, it is delayed news, and he needs to observe the laws of mourning for only one hour. Whether he received the news by day or he received it at night, one hour of mourning is sufficient. This is true even for one&#x2019;s parents. However, the mourning which is observed for one&#x2019;s father or mother during the entire twelve months applies even when the news of the death was delayed. These twelve months are counted from the day of death. If one received word of the death of his father or mother, after twelve months, he need observe only one hour of mourning, even with regard to things that are usually observed throughout the twelve months.</p>
<p>3) One who receives delayed news need not observe all the laws of mourning, and removal of his shoes is sufficient. He is permitted to work, bathe, anoint himself, to have marital relations and to study Torah. If he was not wearing shoes when he received the news, he must do something else to indicate that he is doing so to observe mourning such as sitting on the ground for an hour.</p>
<p>4) If he received timely news on Shabbos, the Shabbos is counted as one day, and at the conclusion of Shabbos he must tear his garments and observe six days of mourning.</p>
<p>5) If he received timely news on Shabbos or on Yom Tov, but at the conclusion of Shabbos or Yom Tov it will become delayed news, he must observe all the laws of private mourning on Shabbos or Yom Tov and at the conclusion of Shabbos or <italic>Yom Tov</italic> he should observe one hour&#x2019;s mourning as is done for delayed tidings.</p>
<p>6) If he received timely news on Shabbos and it is the eve of a Yom Tov, since he must observe mourning in privacy, the Yom Tov cancels the seven days of mourning.</p>
<p>7) If one received delayed news on Shabbos or Yom Tov, he should not observe any mourning, not even in private matters. At the conclusion of Shabbos or Yom Tov, he should observe one hour of mourning, and that is sufficient.</p>
<p>8) If one found out after Yom Tov that a relative had died before Yom Tov, although for those who observed mourning before Yom Tov, the Yom Tov cancels the remaining days, nevertheless, since he did not observe any mourning before Yom Tov, the remaining days are not cancelled. [In such a case] if he received the news even on the thirtieth day after the burial, it is timely news for him, and he must observe the seven and thirty-day periods of mourning.</p>
<p>9) If a person lost a relative and does not know about it, you should not inform him of it. Concerning one who bears such news it is said, &#x201C;He who utters a report is a fool.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1369">1</xref></sup> You are permitted to invite him to a betrothal feast and to any other joyful gathering, for as long as he is uninformed, he is like any other person. Also, if a husband knows that his wife&#x2019;s relative died, he is permitted to have marital relations with her, since she does not know about it.</p>
<p>10) However, if you are asked if a relative is alive, you should not lie and say he is alive, for it says, &#x201C;Keep far from a false matter,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1370">2</xref></sup> but you should answer him in an ambiguous way, so that he will understand himself that he had died.</p>
<p>11) It is customary to notify sons when their mother or father pass away so that they may say the <italic>Kaddish</italic>.</p>

<title>Chapter 207 Laws of Consoling The Mourners</title>
<p>1) It is a great mitzvah to console mourners. We find that the Holy One blessed is He, consoled mourners, as it is written, &#x201C;And it came to pass after the death of Avraham, that God blessed his son,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1371">1</xref></sup> Yitchak, This is an act of kindness to the living as well as to the deceased.<sup><xref rid="fn1372">2</xref></sup> The comforters are not allowed to speak before the mourner begins to speak, as it is said concerning Job, &#x201C;And none spoke a word to him;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1373">3</xref></sup> and it is written, &#x201C;And after this Job opened his mouth;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1374">4</xref></sup> and later it is written &#x201C;<italic>Eliphaz Hateimani</italic> answered.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1375">5</xref></sup> If the comforters perceive that the mourner wishes them to leave, they are not allowed to remain there.</p>
<p>2) A mourner or a sick person is not required to rise even before a <italic>Nasi</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1376">6</xref></sup> [Under normal circumstances] it is mannerly, when someone wants to honor his friend, and rise before him, his friend should say, &#x201C;Sit.&#x201D; However to a mourner or to a sick person, he should not say this, for it might be construed as &#x201C;Sit in your mourning&#x201D; or &#x201C;Sit in your illness&#x201D;.</p>
<p>3) A person should not say, &#x201C;I have not been punished sufficiently for my evil deeds,&#x201D; or similar expressions, so as not to open the mouth of the Satan.<sup><xref rid="fn1377">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>4) You should not say to the mourner, &#x201C;What can you do? It is impossible to change what the Holy One blessed is He has done,&#x201D; for this is like blasphemy, for it implies that were it possible to change it, he would do so. Rather a person must accept upon himself the decree of the Almighty, blessed is He, with love.<sup><xref rid="fn1378">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>5) Mourners should observe their mourning in the place where the soul of the deceased departed, for in that place, the soul of the deceased grieves, and that is the place to comfort it. It is a mitzvah to pray there with a <italic>minyan</italic> of ten men in the morning and evening, even if there is no mourner present, for it is a consolation for the soul. If there is a mourner present, he may be counted in the <italic>minyan</italic>. A <italic>Seifer Torah</italic> should be brought there earlier, and a suitable place should be prepared for it, for the entire time they will pray there. If two deaths occurred in two separate houses, in one of which there is a mourner, while in the other there is no mourner, and there are not enough worshipers in the city to have a <italic>minyan</italic> of ten pray in each house, they should pray in the house where there is no mourner. In the house of the deceased it is customary to say, <italic>Psalm</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1379">9</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Lamanetzeach</italic>, etc. <italic>Shimu Zoss Kol Ha&#x2019;ammim</italic>&#x201D; etc. after <italic>Shacharis</italic> and <italic>Minchah</italic>. And it is certainly good to study <italic>Mishnayos</italic> there, for the benefit of the soul. (The Hebrew letters of the word <italic>Mishnah</italic>. are the same as the word <italic>neshoma</italic> (soul).)</p>
<p>6) <italic>Hallel</italic> is not said in the house where the death occured, if the mourner is present during the first seven days of mourning, (because it is considered like mocking the poor, for in <italic>Hallel</italic> we say, &#x201C;The dead do not praise God.&#x201D;) If there is another room, the mourner should go into that room, and the congregation should say <italic>Hallel</italic>. And if there is no other room, then on <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>, those who prayed there need not say <italic>Hallel</italic> at home afterwards. But on Chanukah, they must say <italic>Hallel</italic> in their homes. And if they are praying in the house where the death occured but where there is no mourner present, or in the mourner&#x2019;s house, but the death did not occur there,<sup><xref rid="fn1380">10</xref></sup> <italic>Hallel</italic> should be recited even on <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>, but the mourner should not recite it, (because in it, it is said, &#x201C;This day was made by Adonoy; let us exult and rejoice in Him.&#x201D;) If the seventh day of mourning occurs during the days of Chanukah, then after the comforters leave, at which time mourning ceases, the mourner, too, must recite the <italic>Hallel</italic>, because it is obligatory. Other <italic>Poskim</italic> are of the opinion that on Chanukah, <italic>Hallel</italic> should be recited even in the house of a mourner<sup><xref rid="fn1381">11</xref></sup> with the <italic>Minyan</italic>. If <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> occurs on Shabbos, <italic>Hallel</italic> should be recited with the <italic>Minyan</italic>, even in the house of a mourner, for on Shabbos, public mourning is not observed.</p>
<p>7) The special <italic>berachos</italic> for mourners in the <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> is not part of our custom today, because we rely on the opinion of the <italic>Poskim</italic> who maintain that these <italic>berachos</italic> were enacted to be said only when <italic>Birkas Hamazon</italic> is recited with a <italic>minyan</italic> of ten.</p>

<title>Chapter 208 Work that a Mourner Is Forbidden To Perform</title>
<p>1) These are the things a mourner is forbidden to do during the first seven days: to work, to bathe, to anoint himself to wear shoes and to engage in marital relations. He is forbidden to study Torah, he is forbidden to offer greetings, he is forbidden to wear a pressed garment, cut his hair, or be present at any festivity. He is also forbidden to put on <italic>Tefillin</italic> the first day.</p>
<p>2) What are the rules concerning work? During the first three days<sup><xref rid="fn1382">1</xref></sup> a mourner must not perform any work, even if he is a poor man who relies on charity. But after the fourth day if the mourner is a poor man, and has nothing to eat, he may work privately at home. A woman may also work privately in her own home to earn enough for her sustenance. But our Sages say:<sup><xref rid="fn1383">2</xref></sup> &#x201C;May a curse fall on the mourner&#x2019;s neighbors who made it necessary for him to do work,&#x201D; for it is their duty to provide for the poor, especially during the days of his mourning.</p>
<p>3) It is forbidden even to have his work done by others, and even by a non-Jew. If the work is very urgent and he might sustain a loss by not doing it, he should consult a competent Rav.</p>
<p>4) Just as he is forbidden to do work, so is he forbidden to transact business. If he possesses merchandise, which unless he sells now he will sustain a loss of the principle, he should consult a competent Rav. If caravans or ships arrived with merchandise, which is now being sold at a low price, and will be unavailable later, or, if he was at the market when he received <italic>timely</italic> news,<sup><xref rid="fn1384">3</xref></sup> he may transact business through others.</p>
<p>5) He may lend money on interest through an agent to non-Jews who are accustomed to borrow from him. The same applies to selling merchandise to his regular customers, so that they should not become accustomed to trade elsewhere.</p>
<p>6) He is permitted to send someone to collect his debts, if he has reason to fear they might become uncollectable later.</p>
<p>7) Such writing that is permitted on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic> is also permitted to a mourner, if it cannot be done by someone else.</p>
<p>8) If a mourner&#x2019;s field is occupied by a tenant either as a sharecropper, (e.g., a third or a quarter share) or on lease (whereby the tenant gives the owner a fixed amount of the field&#x2019;s produce), or on a rental basis (whereby he pays him an amount of money for rent), they may work the field as usual, during the owner&#x2019;s time of mourning, for since the work is for their own benefit (profit), they need not suffer any loss on the account of the owner&#x2019;s mourning. However, if the mourner has a day laborer working in his field, he is forbidden to let him work, even if the field is in another city, since the work being done is for the benefit of the mourner, and it is done publicly.</p>
<p>9) If the mourner is a sharecropper in the field of another, he himself is forbidden to do the work, but he may employ others to do it, for it is not called the work of the mourner, but rather that of the owner of the field. If others have contracted work for the mourner to do, he is forbidden to do it even by employing others. But if it is work the delay of which will cause him to sustain a [substantial] loss, he may have it done by others.</p>
<p>10) When the animals of a mourner are hired out to another person, the renter is permitted to do work with them, since he rented them before the owner became a mourner, and through renting one acquires certain rights of ownership, and they are considered the property of the renter; but after expiration of the time for which they were rented, he is forbidden to use them.</p>
<p>11) A mourner is permitted to accept work to be done after his period of mourning, provided he does not weigh or measure as he would do at other times.</p>
<p>12) If the mourner had given work to a contractor, since it is on a contractual basis, and the work was received prior to his becoming a mourner, and it is being done privately at the home of the contractor, the contractor is permitted to do it.</p>
<p>13) Construction of a building belonging to a mourner, even if done by a non-Jew on a contractual basis, and in a far-away place where no Jews live, is forbidden. If the work in his field was given to others on a contractual basis, whereby he pays the worker a fixed wage for all the work in the field: ploughing, sowing, harvesting, and similar work, some <italic>Poskim</italic> permit the work to be done.</p>
<p>14) Domestic chores are not considered forbidden work for a mourner. Thus, a woman is permitted, during the period of her mourning, to bake, cook, and do all household chores that she finds necessary. But that which is not necessary is forbidden to do. Also, a domestic servant who is in mourning, even though she is a paid servant she is permitted to do all the housework. But she is not permitted to do work that is not necessary for the house, but only to earn extra money, and certainly she may not leave the house just as any other mourner is forbidden to do so.</p>
<p>15) If two people are partners in a store, and one of them became a mourner, they must close their store, so that the partner does not do work in public. But he may do work in the privacy of his home, even in such matters in which both partners have an interest. If the mourner is a distinguished person, and the business bears his name, as he has a share in it, the partner is forbidden to conduct the business even in his own home. In the event a great loss would be sustained if the the mourner&#x2019;s partner, too, would not open the store, they should consult a competent Rav as to whether it may be opened after three days.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 209 The prohibition to Bathe, Anoint, Wear Shoes And to Engage In Marital Relations.</title>
<p>1) The mourner is forbidden to wash his entire body even with cold water; but his face, hands and feet are only forbidden to be washed with warm water, but are permitted to be washed with cold water. Bathing with warm water is forbidden during the entire thirty day mourning period, and even washing the head with warm water is forbidden. Similarly, bathing the entire body with cold water, if done for pleasure, is forbidden the entire thirty days. A woman, for the necessity of bathing before the ritual immersion, is permitted to bathe in warm water after the seven days of mourning have passed. With regard to wearing clean white garments, refer to Chapter 159:5.</p>
<p>2) If a woman becomes a mourner after giving birth, and she must bathe, she is permitted to bathe even during the seven days of mourning. However, on the first day she should be stringent and not bathe if it is not that necessary. Similarly, a person of delicate constitution, who would suffer greatly if he did not bathe, and his health might be affected, is permitted to bathe. Also, one who has disturbing head pains is permitted to wash his head with warm water.</p>
<p>3) A mourner is forbidden to anoint himself even in a minimal fashion if it is for the sake of pleasure. However, if his intention is to remove dirt, he is permitted to anoint himself. It is certainly permitted for medical purposes, as when he has scabs on his head.</p>
<p>4) A person who had multiple periods of mourning, such as two consecutive periods of mourning, is permitted to bathe with cold water.</p>
<p>5) The prohibition against wearing shoes applies only to leather shoes; but shoes of cloth, reeds, hair, or wood, are permitted, for the term &#x201C;shoe&#x201D; refers only to a shoe made of leather. A wooden shoe covered with leather is forbidden. Although the mourner is forbidden to wear shoes, nevertheless, in the morning he should say the <italic>berachah</italic>, &#x201C;<italic>She&#x2019;assa Lee Kol Tzarkee</italic>&#x201D; (&#x201C;Who provided me with all my needs&#x201D;).</p>
<p>6) A woman within thirty days after giving birth is permitted to wear shoes; so is an ill person, or one who has a wound on his foot, because the cold is harmful to them.</p>
<p>7) A mourner who must travel on the road, is permitted to wear shoes. he should, however, put a bit of earth in his shoes. Similarly, in all other instances when a mourner must wear shoes, he should do this.</p>
<p>8) A mourner is forbidden to engage in marital relations. Embracing and kissing are also forbidden. But other acts of intimacy, such as filling a cup, making the bed and similar things, are permitted. [It makes no difference if] the husband is the mourner, or the wife is the mourner.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Chapter 210 The Prohibition To Study Torah And To Exchange Greetings</title>
<p>1) A mourner is forbidden to study Torah, for it is written, &#x201C;The precepts of <italic>Adonoy</italic>, are upright, rejoicing the heart.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1385">1</xref></sup> and a mourner is forbidden to rejoice. He is forbidden to study the Scriptures, the <italic>Mishnah</italic>, and the <italic>Talmud</italic>, including the laws and <italic>Aggadah</italic>. But he is permitted to read the book of <italic>Job, Lamentations</italic>, and the mournful sections of <italic>Jeremiah</italic>. In the <italic>Talmud</italic>, he may study chapter, <italic>V&#x2019;eelu Megalchin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1386">2</xref></sup> dealing with the laws of the excommunicated and the mourner, and also <italic>Maseches Semachos</italic>. And in the <italic>Seforim</italic> (books) of <italic>Halachah</italic> (laws), he may study the laws concerning mourning. However, he is forbidden to probe and analyze even the subjects he is permitted to study.</p>
<p>2) After three days of mourning, one who teaches Torah to children is permitted to teach the children everything they need to learn, so that they are not interrupted from their studies; for the (study of) children whose mouths are pure of sin, is more precious than the study of adults. Likewise a mourner&#x2019;s young children should not be interrupted from their studies, for they are not obligated to observe mourning.</p>
<p>3) Even if the mourner is a <italic>Kohein</italic> and there is no other <italic>Kohein</italic> in the synagogue, he is forbidden to go up to read the Torah.</p>
<p>4) When he prays during all seven days of mourning, a mourner should not recite <italic>Pittum Haketoress, Keitsad</italic> [How was the incense compounded] nor should he say <italic>Maamados</italic>, and after the Chapter of <italic>Eizehu Mekoman</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1387">3</xref></sup> he should not say <italic>Yehi Ratzon</italic> etc. [May it be Your will] (because a mourner may not send offerings). When reciting <italic>Havdalah</italic> at the conclusion of Shabbos over a cup [of wine], he should not say the introductary verses of joy, but should begin immediately with the <italic>berachos</italic>.</p>
<p>5) During his seven days of mourning a mourner should not officiate as <italic>Chazzan</italic> unless there is no one else to lead the prayers. But if he is in mourning for his father or mother, the custom is to permit him to be the <italic>Chazzan</italic> even if there is someone else capable of doing so. It is customary that a mourner not be the <italic>Chazzan</italic> on Shabbos and Yom Tov<sup><xref rid="fn1388">4</xref></sup> during his entire year<sup><xref rid="fn1389">5</xref></sup> [of mourning] unless there is no one else to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn1390">6</xref></sup> If he was accustomed to be the <italic>Chazzan</italic> even before he became a mourner, he is permitted to do so in any event. See Chapter 128:8 above.</p>
<p>6) What is the rule concerning the exchange of greetings? During the first three days, a mourner must not greet anyone. If others who are unaware that he is a mourner greet him, he should not return the greeting, but should inform them that he is a mourner. From the third day until the seventh day, he must not greet anyone, but if others who unaware that he is a mourner greet him, he may respond to their greetings. From the seventh until the thirtieth day, he may extend greetings to others for they have peace of mind, but others should not greet him because he lacks peace of mind. If they did not know he is a mourner and they greeted him, he may respond to their greetings. After thirty days, he may exchange greetings like anyone else.</p>
<p>7) Since he is forbidden to greet anybody, he is certainly forbidden to laugh. Therefore, during the seven days of mourning, he must not take a child in his arms, so he should not be induced to laughter. He is also forbidden to engage in lengthy conversation with people.<sup><xref rid="fn1391">7</xref></sup> However, if he does so out of respect for a group of people, as when many come together to console him, he is permitted to say (when they are leaving), &#x201C;Go to your homes in peace,&#x201D; for out of respect for a group of people, it is permitted.</p>
<p>8) In a place where it is customary to greet the mourners on Shabbos, you may do so. The mourner may greet everybody on Shabbos since it is done publicly.</p>
<p>9) He is permitted to say the <italic>berachah, Shehecheyanu</italic> even during the seven days of mourning, when it is necessary, for instance on Chanukah, or when eating a new fruit and the like.</p>

On <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> he may be the <italic>Chazzan</italic> for <italic>Shacharis</italic>, provided someone else continues with the <italic>Hallel</italic>.

A mourner should not be the <italic>Chazzan</italic> at <italic>Shacharis</italic> on <italic>Chanukah</italic>. <italic>Mishna Berurah</italic> 683:1 A mourner is allowed to be <italic>Chazzan</italic> at <italic>Mincha</italic> and <italic>Ma&#x2019;ariv</italic> on <italic>Chanukah</italic>.

</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Chapter 211 Other Things A Mourner Is Forbidden To Do</title>
<p>1) During the seven days of mourning he is forbidden to sit on a bench or upon pillows and cushions. He must sit on the ground [floor]. But an ill or elderly person, who experience pain when sitting on the floor, may place a small pillow beneath them. However, the mourner may walk or stand, and is not compelled to sit down at all. Only in the presence of the consolers is he required to be seated. He is also forbidden to sleep in a bed or on a bench; he must sleep on the floor. But he may spread pillows and cushions on the floor as he usually does in his bed. Some <italic>Poskim</italic> permit him to sleep in a bed. And some are accustomed to do so because they have frail constitutions, and are considered ill in this regard.</p>
<p>2) On the first day, a mourner is forbidden to put on <italic>Tefillin</italic>, whether it is the day of death and burial or the day of burial alone. If the burial took place at night, he may not put on <italic>Tefillin</italic> the following day. On the second day of mourning, he should put them on after sunrise. The day on which one receives timely news is like the day of death and burial. But if the death occurs on a Festival, or he receives timely news on a Festival, then, on the first day after the Festival, he should put on <italic>Tefillin</italic>.</p>
<p>3) Wrapping the head is not customary in our regions. Nevertheless, one should make a token wrapping, by pulling down the hat close to the eyes during the seven days of mourning. This is not done on Shabbos because this is a public manifestation of mourning.</p>
<p>4) A mourner is forbidden to wear a freshly washed garment, even a shirt, during the seven days of mourning and not even in the honor of Shabbos. Even sheets, bedspreads, and hand-towels, are forbidden if they are freshly washed. However, in honor of Shabbos it is permitted to cover the table with tablecloths that were washed before the period of mourning began.</p>
<p>5) Washing his own garments, even if he intends to leave them until after the seven days of mourning, is forbidden, because it is considered work. However, if his garments are in the hands of others, they are permitted to wash them, like any other type of work which they had contracted to do for him.</p>
<p>6) If one is in a second consecutive period of mourning, he is permitted to wash his garments with water only (not with ash, soap or the like), and to wear them.</p>
<p>7) After the seven days of mourning until the thirtieth day, the <italic>halacha</italic> that forbids the mourner to wear or spread beneath himself a freshly washed garment is applicable only if it is ironed (some say this does not mean ironing, but washing with water and ash or with soda and soap), and is white and new. But it is the custom to forbid wearing even washed garments, even if they were not ironed, unless someone else had worn them for a short time previously. If, however, they were merely washed with water, it is not necessary that another person wear them first.</p>
<p>8) If he does not change his garments for pleasure, rather out of necessity, as when the shirt he is wearing is soiled, or because of a rash, he is permitted to change his garments even during the first seven days, and even on a weekday, provided someone had previously worn them.</p>
<p>9) He is permitted to wash and and iron his garments after the seven days of mourning in order to wear them after the thirty days, or to wear them during the thirty days, after they will have been worn by someone else.</p>
<p>10) During the first thirty days he is forbidden to wear Shabbos clothes even on Shabbos,<sup><xref rid="fn1392">1</xref></sup> and he certainly may not wear new clothing. When mourning the loss of his father or mother, he is by custom forbidden to wear new clothes during the entire twelve months. If, however, he needs them, he should let another person wear them first, for two or three days.</p>
<p>11) A woman, during the first thirty days of mourning, or even during the first seven days of mourning, whose time has come, to go to the synagogue on the Shabbos, after giving birth, customarily considers this Shabbos like a Yom Tov by wearing expensive clothing and gold jewelry. She is permitted to wear Shabbos clothing, but not her Yom Tov clothing, lest her mind be diverted, and she forget she is in mourning. She does not need to change her seat in the synagogue.</p>
<p>12) A mourner is forbidden to have his hair cut during the first thirty days of mourning, whether it is the hair of his head, the beard, or any other part of the body. If he mourns the loss of his father or mother, he is forbidden to cut his hair until he is admonished by his friends. The estimated time of admonishment is a subject of controversy between the <italic>Poskim</italic>. The custom in our regions is not to cut the hair the entire year unless it is necessary, as when his hair is burdensome to him, or if he mingles with people of different nationalities, who would look upon him with scorn because of his hair. In such instances he is allowed to have it cut, for actual admonishment is not required. But if his hair grew to such proportions, that he looks different from his friends, so that people would be apt to say, &#x201C;How different he is,&#x201D; then he is allowed to have it cut, provided it is after thirty days of mourning.</p>
<p>13) Just as he is forbidden to have his hair cut during the first thirty days of mourning, so too is he forbidden to cut his nails with an instrument. But with his hands or teeth, it is permitted even during the first seven days. If he is a <italic>Mohel</italic>, he is forbidden to cut his nails in order to perform the laceration of the foreskin, unless there is no other <italic>Mohel</italic> available, and then he is permitted to do so even during the first seven days. A woman who needs to perform the ritual immersion after the first seven days of mourning, but within the thirty days, should ask a non-Jewess to cut her nails. If a non-Jewess in unavailable, a Jewess may do it.</p>
<p>14) A mourner is permitted to comb his hair with a comb even during the first seven days of mourning.</p>
<p>15) If it customary for a mourner to change his place in the synagogue during the first thirty days of mourning, and after the loss of his father or mother, for twelve months. The change of place should be at least four <italic>amos</italic> away from his original place, and should be to a place that is farther from the <italic>Aron HaKodesh</italic> than his original place.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1392">1. The prevailing custom today is to permit Shabbos clothing even during the first week. (<italic>Gesher HaChaim</italic>, Chapter 21:10:4).</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Chapter 212 Things that are Forbidden Because of &#x201C;Rejoicing&#x201D; After the Seven Days.</title>
<p>1) A mourner is forbidden to eat at the feasts of either a circumcision, redemption of a firstborn, or completion of a <italic>Talmudic</italic> tractate, and especially a wedding feast, during the thirty days of mourning for a relative, and during the entire twelve months of mourning for his father or mother. (Even during a leap-year, twelve months are sufficient). However, in his own house, when there is a feast in honor of a mitzvah, he is permitted to participate. However with regard to a wedding feast. he should be strict [and abstain] even though it is celebrated at his own house, unless it is a wedding in which he is giving an orphaned groom or bride to marriage, and his lack of participation may cause the match to break off. In that case, he is permitted to eat even if the feast is held in another house. He may then also wear his Shabbos clothing after thirty days of mourning for his father or mother, or within thirty days of mourning for other relatives.</p>
<p>2) He is not permitted to invite others or to accept invitations from others. He may not send gifts to others, and others should not send gifts to him during the entire thirty days of mourning, or during the twelve months of mourning for his father or mother. Concerning Shabbos, it depends on the custom,<sup><xref rid="fn1393">1</xref></sup> see Chapter 210:8.</p>
<p>3) If a mourner has been asked to serve as either a <italic>Sandek</italic> or a <italic>Mohel</italic>, after the thirty days of mourning even for his father or mother, he may wear his Shabbos clothing until after the circumcision, and he may even partake of the feast.<sup><xref rid="fn1394">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>4) He is forbidden to enter a house where a wedding feast is being held, during the entire thirty days of mourning for a relative, or the twelve months of mourning for his father or mother, even to hear the <italic>berachos</italic> that are said there. However, during a wedding ceremony that is held in the court of the synagogue, where they are reciting, the <italic>berachos</italic> of betrothal and marriage, he is permitted to stand there and listen to the <italic>berachos</italic> after thirty days of mourning even for his father or mother. He is even permitted to recite the <italic>berachos</italic>, and may even act as best man to escort the bridegroom under the <italic>chupah</italic>. He may wear his Shabbos clothing, provided it is after the thirty days of mourning. However, he is not allowed to enter [the house or hall] to partake of the feast.<sup><xref rid="fn1395">3</xref></sup> Some <italic>Poskim</italic> are lenient, and even permit him to partake of the feast.</p>
<p>5) A mourner may attend a wedding feast if he serves as a waiter. He may also eat in his own house of what is sent to him from the feast.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1393">1. Where it is customary to offer greetings to a mourner on Shabbos, you may send him gifts on Shabbos as well, and if not, not. <italic>Rama</italic> 385:3.

<title>Chapter 213 A Mourner is Forbidden to Marry Laws of a Groom or Bride Who Becomes Mourners</title>
<p>1) During the thirty days of mourning it is forbidden for a man to marry. Likewise, a woman who is a mourner is forbidden to get married until after the thirty days of mourning are over. After thirty days, they are permitted even if they are in mourning for a parent. However, an engagement without a feast, is permitted even during the first seven days of mourning.</p>
<p>2) If one&#x2019;s wife dies, he should not remarry until the three Festivals have passed (<italic>Pesach</italic>, <italic>Shavuos</italic>, <italic>Sukkos</italic>). Rejoicing on the Festivals will help him forget his love for his first wife when he marries the second, so that he will not drink from this cup and have his mind on the first cup. <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> are not considered Festivals in this respect. <italic>Shemini Atzeress</italic>, too, is<sup><xref rid="fn1396">1</xref></sup> not considered a separate Festival in this respect. If he has not yet fulfilled the mitzvah of propagation,<sup><xref rid="fn1397">2</xref></sup> or if he has young children, or if he has no one to look after him, he need not wait for the passage of three Festivals. Nevertheless, it seems [proper] that he should wait until after thirty days have passed. A woman whose husband died, must wait ninety days before remarrying.<sup><xref rid="fn1398">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>3) When everything had been prepared for the wedding, and one of the relatives of the bridegroom died, or one of the bride&#x2019;s relatives died, even if it was the groom&#x2019;s father or the bride&#x2019;s mother, in our times, since others are able to prepare what is needed for the wedding, the wedding must be postponed until after the days of mourning.<sup><xref rid="fn1399">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>4) Even if the death occurred after the <italic>chupah</italic>, the mourner is forbidden to have marital relations until after the seven days of mourning. Since he has not yet had marital relations with her and he is forbidden to have marital relations with her, they are forbidden to be alone without a chaperone. After the seven days of mourning, he may have marital relations with her, and celebrate the seven days of wedding feasts.</p>
<p>5) However, if after they had marital relations a relative of the groom or bride died, they are already subject to the laws pertaining to the week of wedding feasts, which is for them like a Yom Tov, and thus the laws of mourning are not to be observed. These days are even more lenient than a Festival, for they are permitted to put on pressed clothing, and they may have their hair cut. They are forbidden only such things that are done privately. After the seven days of wedding feasts, the seven days of mourning begin. Even the first thirty days of mourning are to be counted only from the beginning of the seven days of mourning. (Although the days of a Yom Tov are always included in the first thirty days of mourning as stated in chapter 219:7, the wedding week is not included since they are permitted to have their hair cut.)</p>
<ftnote id="fn1396">1. <italic>Rabbi Akiva Eiger</italic> (see <italic>Chassam Sofer</italic> resp. 350), but the <italic>Dagul Marevava</italic> says it is counted as a separate Festival in this regard.</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 214 When a Mourner May Leave His House.</title>
<p>1) During the first seven days of mourning, the mourner may not leave his house. However, if a death occurs in his family, or even if a stranger dies, and there are not enough people to attend the funeral and burial, he is permitted to leave his house even on the first day of mourning. If he is summoned by the authorities, or if he must attend to something very urgent to him as otherwise he will sustain a great loss, he is permitted to leave his house, but he should put some earth in his shoes.</p>
<p>2) Even for the purpose of going to the synagogue to pray, the mourner is not allowed to leave his house during the seven days of mourning, except on Shabbos. However, if he is unable to gather a quorum of ten men for a <italic>minyan</italic> and would be compelled to pray alone, and there is a <italic>minyan</italic> in his neighborhood, he may leave his house to go and pray there, in order not to miss praying with a <italic>minyan</italic>.</p>
<p>3) If a mourner has to circumcise his son, he may go to the synagogue for this purpose even during the first three days of mourning. If the mourner is the <italic>Sandek</italic> or <italic>Mohel</italic>, he may not leave the house on that account, during the first three days of mourning. After the first three days, he should pray at home, and when the infant is brought to the synagogue to be circumcised, he may then go to the synagogue. If there is no other <italic>Mohel</italic> in the city. he may go even on the first day of mourning.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 215 Excessive Grief is Forbidden</title>
<p>1) It is forbidden to grieve excessively over the dead, as it is said, &#x201C;Do not weep for the dead, and do not bemoan him.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1400">1</xref></sup> Our Sages of blessed memory, said,<sup><xref rid="fn1401">2</xref></sup> &#x201C;Is it possible to say so? But it means, &#x201C;Do not weep for the dead excessively, and do not bemoan him inordinately.&#x201D; How should one mourn? Three days are appropriate for weeping, seven days for mourning, and thirty days for abstaining from wearing ironed clothes, and from having the hair cut. Thereafter the Holy One, blessed is He, says, &#x201C;You are not permitted to show him more compassion than I do.&#x201D; Our Sages, of blessed memory, said,<sup><xref rid="fn1402">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;One who grieves excessively over the dead, will have cause to weep over another death.&#x201D; This applies only when the deceased was an ordinary person, but if he was a Torah scholar, he is mourned in proportion to his wisdom. Nevertheless, you should not weep over him more than thirty days, for he is not greater than Moshe <italic>Rabbeinu</italic>, peace unto him, of whom it is written, &#x201C;And the Children of Yisrael wept for Moshe thirty days.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1403">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) Our Rabbis of blessed memory, said,<sup><xref rid="fn1404">5</xref></sup> &#x201C;When a family member dies, the entire family has cause for concern.&#x201D; To what can this be compared? To an arch made of stone, when one stone shakes all of them are insecure. In other words, severe judgement hovers over them, until it is gradually diminished. For during the first seven days of mourning the sword is drawn, and up to thirty days it is gradually withdrawn, and is not returned to its sheath until after twelve months. Therefore, during the first three days the mourner should perceive himself as if the sword is resting between his shoulders; from the third day to the seventh day, as if it were standing in a corner, facing him; from the seventh day to the thirtieth as if it were passing before him in the street. And thereafter during the entire year, the severe judgement still hangs over that family. If a son is born in that family, the entire family is healed [saved]. This is true only if a male child was born; for when a male comes to this world, peace comes to the world. Likewise when a member of a group dies, judgement hangs over the entire group, and they all have cause to be concerned.</p>
<p>3) He who does not mourn, in the manner the Sages have ordained, is considered a heartless person. But he should arouse himself from his sleep, examine his deeds with fear and anxiety, and repent and then, perhaps he may be spared from the sword of the angel of death. For it is said, &#x201C;You have smitten them, but they were not greived,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1405">6</xref></sup> which indicates that a person must awaken, examine [his deeds] and repent.</p>

<title>Chapter 216 Parts of the Seventh and Thirtieth Days and Laws of the Twelve Months</title>
<p>1) On the seventh day, after the consolers have left the mourner, he is permitted to do all the things that were forbidden during the seven days. because we say that a part of the day is considered like the entire day, except with regard to marital relations, which is forbidden the entire seventh day (even in a dark room). In those places where the consolers are not accustomed to come on the seventh day, he must wait until the time they used to come on the other days, which is after people leave the synagogue in the morning. If the seventh day of mourning occurs on Shabbos, then after people leave the synagogue in the morning, he is permitted to study Torah.</p>
<p>2) Regarding the thirtieth day we also say that part of the day is considered like the entire day. And since no consolers come then, therefore, immediately after sunrise he is absolved of the laws governing the thirty days of mourning. If the thirtieth day occurs on a Shabbos the mourner is permitted to bathe on Friday, with warm water, in honor of the Shabbos. He may put on Shabbos clothes and return to his regular seat in the synagogue; but he may not have his hair cut.</p>
<p>3) Regarding the twelve month period of mourning for a father or mother we do not say part of the day is considered like the entire day. On the contrary, it is customary to add the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> (anniversary of death) day in which to observe all the laws of mourning that pertain to the twelve months of mourning, even if it occurs on Shabbos. However, if it was a leap year, the custom is to observe mourning for the honor of a father and mother only twelve months. Since the twelve months expired before the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> day, therefore, on the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> day he is not required to resume mourning.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Chapter 217 The Law if One Neglected to Observe Mourning.</title>
<p>1) A mourner who neglected to observe mourning during the first seven days, whether inadvertently or intentionally, may fulfill his obligation during the thirty day period, with the exception of tearing his garments. If he did not tear his garments, at his moment of grief, he should not tear them, for tearing the garments are of no avail except during the first seven days which are considered a time of grief. For his father or mother one must tear his garments at any time.</p>
<p>2) If a child under thirteen years loses a relative, even if he becomes thirteen years of age during the first seven days of mourning, since he was exempt at the time of death, the laws of mourning are cancelled for him.<sup><xref rid="fn1406">1</xref></sup> However he should observe the twelve month period of mourning for his father or mother, which is for their honor.</p>
<p>3) If a sick person was notified about the death of a relative for whom he must mourn, and he recovered during the first seven days, he should complete the remaining days. Similarly, with regard to the thirty days of mourning, he should complete the remaining days. But he does not have to make up the days that passed when he was ill, because then, too, he had observed partial mourning. This is comparable to Shabbos, which is included in the seven days of mourning, and does not suspend it. Similarly, a woman who had given birth does not need to make up the days that passed during her confinement, but merely completes the remaining days of mourning.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1406">1. Some <italic>Poskim</italic> disagree and prevailing custom is that he should observe the remaining days. See <italic>Gesher HaChaim</italic> 19:3:3. A Rav should be consulted.</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Chapter 218 The Law of Testimony Relating to Mourning</title>
<p>1) A person must observe the laws of mourning on the testimony of one witness, or the testimony of a witness who heard about is from another witness, or by the disinterested statement of a non-Jew.<sup><xref rid="fn1407">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2) How should one who receives a letter notifying him of the death of his relative conduct himself when it is not clear whether it is still within thirty days of the death, or after thirty days. If the writer is not learned in Torah, we assume that the relative was alive, and did not die until right before the letter was written, and thus he must observe mourning for him. However, if the writer is learned in Torah, we assume it is after the thirty days, for if it were possible that the letter would arrive during the first thirty days, he would not have written it without specifiying the date.<sup><xref rid="fn1408">2</xref></sup> If however, he was informed of the death of his father or his mother, since it is customary to notify [the son] immediately,<sup><xref rid="fn1409">3</xref></sup> he must observe the laws of mourning.<sup><xref rid="fn1410">4</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1407">1. Any testimony that is sufficient to permit one&#x2019;s wife to remarry is certainly sufficient for the laws of mourning. <italic>Ramban</italic>.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 219 The Law of Mourning on a Shabbos or Yom Tov</title>
<p>1) On Shabbos during the seven days of mourning, the mourner must observe the laws that concern his private life. This means he is forbidden to have marital relations, and to bathe.<sup><xref rid="fn1411">1</xref></sup> But he should not observe any mourning in public. Therefore, before saying &#x201C;<italic>Mizmor Shir Leyom Ha&#x2019;Shabbos</italic>&#x201D; he should put on his shoes, sit on a chair, and change his torn garment, as stated above, Chapter 195:6. Torah study is considered a private mattes,<sup><xref rid="fn1412">2</xref></sup> but, to review the weekly portion of the Torah, the Scripture twice, and the Targum once,<sup><xref rid="fn1413">3</xref></sup> is permissible. Since it is the duty of every Jew to complete the weekly portion of the Torah, it is likened to the reading of the <italic>Shema</italic>, and other such portions of the daily prayers.</p>
<p>2) If the mourner was called to the reading of the Torah, he must go up, for if he were to refuse, it would constitute a public display of mourning. <italic>Rabbeinu Tam</italic> used to be called to the Torah to the reading of the third portion every Shabbos; and when he happened to be in mourning and the <italic>Chazzan</italic> failed to call him, he went up himself. He said that since he had been accustomed to read the third portion every Shabbos, those who would see that he did not go up this day would understand that it was due to his mourning, and this would be a public display of mourning. Also, if a <italic>Kohein</italic> is a mourner, and there is no other <italic>Kohein</italic> in the synagogue, they must call him up to the reading of the Torah. However, it is preferable that he leave the synagogue<sup><xref rid="fn1414">4</xref></sup> before the <italic>Seifer Torah</italic> is taken out of the <italic>Aron HaKodesh</italic>. Also, if the mourner has a son to be circumcised and it is the custom that he must go up to the Torah reading, they should call him up. For if they do not call him, it constitutes a public display of mourning.<sup><xref rid="fn1415">5</xref></sup> But it is preferable that he not be in the synagogue during the reading of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1416">6</xref></sup> (As for a woman whose time has come to go to the synagogue occurs on the Shabbos during her mourning, see chapter 211:11, above.)</p>
<p>3) If one is officially appointed by the congregation to be the reader of the Torah in the synagogue on Shabbos, and he became a mourner on the Shabbos of the first seven days, he should not go to <italic>that</italic> synagogue; for if he is present there, it will raise the question if he should read or not.</p>
<p>4) Shabbos is included in the seven days of mourning. Even if he received <italic>timely</italic> news of the death of a relative on Shabbos, when he had not yet begun mourning, it is still counted as one of the seven days, and at the conclusion of the Shabbos, he must tear his garments.</p>
<p>5) If he buried his dead, or received <italic>timely</italic> news of his relatives death, on a <italic>Yom Tov</italic>, whether on Yom Tov itself, or on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>, he is not subject to the laws of mourning,<sup><xref rid="fn1417">7</xref></sup> until after the Yom Tov. This rule applies to the observance of mourning in public. But the laws concerning his private life must be observed even on a <italic>Yom Tov</italic>. He should not change his garments,<sup><xref rid="fn1418">8</xref> <xref rid="fn1419">9</xref></sup> for this would constitute a public display of mourning. (Although every other mourner must change his clothing during a Yom Tov, nevertheless, this person who has not yet begun to mourn, should not change his garments during the Festival). One who puts on <italic>Tefillin</italic> during <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>, should also put them on on the first day after the burial.<sup><xref rid="fn1420">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) At the conclusion of Yom Tov, he begins to count the seven days of mourning. The last day of Yom Tov is counted as one of the seven days and he counts six days after it. Even the second day of Rosh Hashanah is included in the seven days.</p>
<p>7) Although the laws of mourning do not apply on Yom Tov and <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>, and even the laws of the thirty days of mourning do not apply, and he is permitted to wear pressed garments; nevertheless, since he is forbidden to have his hair cut because of the Yom Tov, the days of the Yom Tov are included in the thirty days and the thirty days are counted from the day the burial took place. Although <italic>Shemini Atzeress</italic> is a Yom Tov by itself, nevertheless, since he has not yet begun mourning, it does not cancel the period of mourning and in the total of thirty days, it counts as only one day.</p>
<p>8) However, if a bridegroom marries before a Yom Tov, and the Yom Tov occurs in the middle of the wedding week, and his relative died during the Yom Tov, then the days of his wedding week, are not included in the total of thirty days.</p>
<p>9) Although no mourning is observed on a Yom Tov, it is still proper to console the mourner (this does not constitute mourning, since the mourner himself does nothing). After the Yom Tov, at the end of seven days from the burial, although, as yet, the seven days of mourning have not expired, he may employ<sup><xref rid="fn1421">11</xref></sup> others to do his work<sup><xref rid="fn1422">12</xref></sup> in their homes, and his servants may work for him privately in his home. It is not necessary to console him after the Yom Tov, for as many days as they comforted him during the Yom Tov, but they should visit him during those days.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1411">1. In warm water. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 548:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1412">2. And is forbidden. <italic>Ritva</italic> and <italic>Ran, Masechess Moed Kattan</italic> 22.

Natanzohn in his <italic>Yosef Da&#x2019;as</italic>, resp. 376 permits the learning of the sad things in Scripture, and everything one may learn on <italic>Tisha B&#x2019;av</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1413">3. He may do this even on Friday afternoon. <italic>Kerem Shlomo. Maharil</italic> forbids this even on Shabbos.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1414">4. This is true only if it is the accepted practice for the <italic>Kohein</italic> to leave in order for a <italic>Yisroel</italic> to be called up. See <italic>Chassam Sofer</italic> resp. <italic>Yoreh</italic> Deah 352. <italic>Tashbatz</italic> 2:276 states he should not go out, because doing so constitutes public display of mourning. And so the <italic>Rabbeinu Tam</italic> did not go out either.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1415">5. <italic>Halachos Ketanos</italic> 1:289, <italic>Aish Dos</italic> resp. 7. The <italic>Maharshal</italic> responsa 71 says not to call him.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1417">7. However he should light a candle, as is done on the seven days of mourning. It should not be lit where he eats and not where the person died. On Yom Tov it must be lit by a non-Jew, because the candle is not for his personal needs for Yom Tov.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1418">8. He should not remove his Yom Tov garments. With regard to new clothing, the <italic>Peri Megadim</italic> is doubtful. <italic>Sha&#x2019;ar Hatziyon</italic> 548:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1419">9. He should also not change his place in the synagogue. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 548:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1420">10. The <italic>Peri Megadim</italic> is doubtful about this. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 38:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1421">11. Even though they did not recieve the work before his becoming a mourner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1422">12. If he cannot find workers to do it, and he will suffer a loss, perhaps he may do it himself as the <italic>Levush</italic> permits it even if he could find others to do it. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 548:22.</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Chapter 220 The Mourning Period is Cancelled By a Festival</title>
<p>1) A Festival cancels the seven-day and the thirty day periods of mourning. Thus, if one buries his dead before a Festival, and observed some time in mourning, as soon as the Festival begins, his mourning is suspended. Even if the burial took place on the eve of Yom Tov, toward the close of the day, so that the laws of mourning pertained to him, even if he merely removed his shoes for just a short time before Yom Tov, the Festival suspends the mourning, and we consider it as though he had observed the entire seven days of mourning. The first day of the Yom Tov is counted as the eighth day,<sup><xref rid="fn1423">1</xref></sup> and he then completes the thirty day mourning period. Even if the eve of Yom Tov is Shabbos, and he received <italic>timely</italic> news towards the evening, although on Shabbos the only laws of mourning observed are those concerning his private life, since at least these laws were observed, the Festival cancels the seven days of mourning.</p>
<p>2) If the mourner either inadvertently or intentionally neglected to observe any mourning<sup><xref rid="fn1424">2</xref></sup> before the Festival, or if the burial took place close to nightfall, whereby he was unable to observe any mourning, the Festival does not cancel it, and he is subject to the same law as one who buries his dead during a Festival.</p>
<p>3) If one of the days of mourning, except the seventh day, occurs on the eve of a Festival, since the Festival will cancel the seven-day mourning period, some <italic>Poskim</italic> permit him to wash his clothes, provided he does not wear them until nightfall. It is best to take care not to wash them until the afternoon,<sup><xref rid="fn1425">3</xref></sup> so that it is evident that he is washing them on account of the Festival. He is forbidden to bathe until nightfall, but some <italic>Poskim</italic> permit bathing<sup><xref rid="fn1426">4</xref></sup> after the <italic>Minchah</italic> service,<sup><xref rid="fn1427">5</xref></sup> close to nightfall. In places where this custom prevails one may follow it. With regard to having his hair cut, all <italic>Poskim</italic> agree that it is forbidden.</p>
<p>4) If he buried his dead seven days before the Festival, since he observed seven days of mourning before the Festival, the Festival cancels the thirty day mourning period. This is true even when the seventh day occurs on the day before Yom Tov; since we maintain that part of the day is like an entire day; as soon as the people leave the synagogue (in the morning), the seven day mourning period has been completed, and the remainder of the day is counted as part of the thirty-day mourning period, which is cancelled by the Festival. The mourner may wash his clothing, bathe, and have his hair cut on the eve of the Festival towards nightfall.<sup><xref rid="fn1428">6</xref></sup> since he is doing it in honor of the Festival, and the Festival cancels the thirty-day mourning period. If the seventh day occurs on the eve of <italic>Pesach</italic>, since the afternoon which is the time the Pascal lamb was offered, is regarded somewhat as a Yom Tov, he is permitted to bathe immediately after midday and to have his hair cut before noon (since after midday, another person is forbidden to cut his hair for him).</p>
<p>5) If the seventh day of mourning occurs on Friday, and Shabbos will be the eve of Yom Tov, he is permitted to wash his clothing, bathe, and have his hair cut on the eve of Shabbos.<sup><xref rid="fn1429">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>6) If a mourner neglected to have his hair cut on the eve of Shabbos, or on the eve of Yom Tov, he is forbidden to have his hair cut on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>, since he was able to have his hair cut before then. He is, however, permitted to have his hair cut after Yom Tov. If the seventh day of mourning occurred on Shabbos, which is the eve of Yom Tov, since from the standpoint of the laws of mourning he was allowed to have his hair cut then, but was prevented because of Shabbos, it is considered as though he was prevented by an accident, and he is, therefore, permitted to have his hair cut even on <italic>Chol Hamoed</italic>.</p>
<p>7) A Festival cancels the thirty-day mourning period, only if the mourning is for other relatives; but if he is mourning for his father or mother, since he is forbidden to have his hair cut until his friends reprove him,<sup><xref rid="fn1430">8</xref></sup> the Festival does not cancel this regulation.</p>
<p>8) If one had observed mourning for one hour, (not exactly, but even less than an hour) before <italic>Pesach</italic>, that hour is considered like seven days, which together with the eight days of <italic>Pesach</italic>, make a total of fifteen days, to which he must add another fifteen days to complete the thirty-day mourning period. If he observed mourning for one hour before <italic>Shavuos</italic>, that hour is regarded as seven days, and the first day of <italic>Shavuos</italic> is also regarded as seven days (since its sacred offerings can be brought on any of the following seven days,) and the second day of <italic>Shavuos</italic> is counted as his fifteenth day, after which he must add another fifteen days. If he observed mourning for one hour before the Festival of <italic>Sukkos</italic>, it is counted as seven days, which together with the seven days of <italic>Sukkos</italic> make a total of fourteen days. The Festival of <italic>Shemini Atzeress</italic> is also counted as seven days (for it is a Festival in its own right, and amends<sup><xref rid="fn1431">9</xref></sup> can be made for its sacrifices), making it a total of twenty-one days. The day of <italic>Simchas Torah</italic> counts as the twenty-second day, and he must add another eight days.</p>
<p>9) <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> are also considered Festivals with regard to canceling the seven and thirty-day mourning periods. Thus, if one observed mourning for one hour before <italic>Rosh Hashanah, Rosh Hashanah</italic> cancels the seven day period, and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> cancels the thirty-day period. If he observed mourning for one hour before <italic>Yom Kippur, Yom Kippur</italic> cancels the seven day period,<sup><xref rid="fn1432">10</xref></sup> and <italic>Sukkos</italic> cancels the thirty-day period.</p>
<p>10) Although a Festival cancels the seven-day mourning period, nevertheless, the candle that is customarily lit in the place where the death occurred, to honor the soul of the deceased, should also be lit on Yom Tov. However, it is better to light it in the synagogue.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1423">1. Although it is a Festival, since it is during the thirty days of mourning he may not wear freshly pressed garments. <italic>Ramban, Mishnah Berurah</italic> 548:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1424">2. If however he observed some aspect of mourning, the Festival does cancel the rest of the mourning (Sha&#x2019;ar Hatzion 548:18).</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 221 The Law of Fasting on the Day of Yahrzeit</title>
<p>1) It is a <italic>Mitzvah</italic> to fast, every year, on the anniversary of the death of one&#x2019;s father or mother, as an inspiration to repentance, to examine his deeds on that day and lament his wrong doings. By doing this, he will bring merit to his father and mother, so that they will be exalted in <italic>Gan Eiden</italic>. Towards evening, in the <italic>Shemoneh Esreh</italic> of <italic>Minchah</italic>, he should say <italic>Aneinu</italic> (Answer us) just as on any private fast day. If a person fasted on one <italic>Yahrzeit</italic>, it is presumed that it was his intention to fast that day all his lifetime, and therefore it becomes like a vow, which is binding upon him as a Scriptual obligation, and he is obligated to fast on that day forever. If he becomes ill, or if he is in some other situation where he must eat, he must have his vow annulled. However, if he distinctly declared that his fasting is not an acceptance of a vow, annulment is not necessary. It is customary to light a <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> candle.</p>
<p>2) The <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> fast is always observed on the day of death even in the first year. Even if the death occurred towards the end of the day, after the congregation said the <italic>Maariv</italic> prayer, if it is still day, that day is fixed as the day of <italic>Yahrzeit</italic>. However, if the burial took place several days after the death occurred, the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> fast should be observed the first year on the date of the burial,<sup><xref rid="fn1433">1</xref></sup> but in subsequent years on the day of death.</p>
<p>3) If death occurs during a leap year, either in the first or second month of <italic>Adar</italic>, then, in a regular year, the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> fast is observed on that day of <italic>Adar</italic>. And in a leap year it should be observed in the month when the death occurred; if in the first <italic>Adar</italic>, it is observed in the first, and if in the second, it is observed in the second.<sup><xref rid="fn1434">2</xref></sup> If the death occurred in (<italic>Adar</italic> of) a regular year, then, during a leap year it is observed in the first <italic>Adar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1435">3</xref></sup> In the second <italic>Adar</italic>, too, he should say <italic>Kaddish</italic> but he may not encroach upon the rights of others.</p>
<p>4) The month of <italic>Cheshvan</italic> is sometimes full, that is, it consists of thirty days, and then, <italic>Rosh Chodesh Kislev</italic> that follows, is two days. The first day of this <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> [<italic>Kislev</italic>] is the thirtieth day of <italic>Cheshvan</italic> and belongs to it (<italic>Cheshvan</italic>), and the second day of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> is the first of <italic>Kislev</italic>. (This is true of every <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> which consists of two days; the first day is the thirtieth of the previous month, and belongs to it.) Sometimes the month of <italic>Cheshvan</italic> is lacking, that is, it consists of only twenty-nine days, and <italic>Rosh Chodesh Kislev</italic> that follows is only one day. Also the month of <italic>Kislev</italic> is full sometimes, and <italic>Rosh Chodesh Teives</italic> that follows is two days, and other times it is lacking, and <italic>Rosh Chodesh Teives</italic> that follows consists of only one day. If someone dies on <italic>Rosh Chodesh Kislev</italic> when it was only one day, then, in a year when <italic>Rosh Chodesh Kislev</italic> will be two days, the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> should be observed on the second day of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>, which is the first day of <italic>Chodesh Kislev</italic>, for the death occurred on the first day of <italic>Kislev</italic>. However, if someone died on the first day of <italic>Rosh Chodesh Kislev</italic> when <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> was two days, then in a year when <italic>Rosh Chodesh Kislev</italic> is only one day, there is a question when the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> is to be observed; if on the twenty-ninth of <italic>Cheshvan</italic>, since he died at the end of <italic>Cheshvan</italic>, or, perhaps, since as regards the law of vows, we are guided by colloquial language, the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> should be observed on <italic>Rosh Chodesh Kislev</italic> as the first day of <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> is usually called. The following is the proper procedure: If in the first year (after the death occurred) <italic>Rosh Chodesh Kislev</italic> is only one day, the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> should be observed on the twenty-ninth of <italic>Cheshvan</italic>, and similarly when ever <italic>Cheshvan</italic> is lacking. Nevertheless, if the next day, on <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>, there are no mourners present, he should recite <italic>Kaddish</italic> and lead the services on that day, but he may not encroach upon the rights of others. If, however, also in the first year following the death, <italic>Rosh Chodesh Kislev</italic> is two days, then the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> is established to be observed on <italic>Rosh Chodesh Kislev</italic>, and he should forever observe it on that day. Even when <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> will be only one day, the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> should be observed on <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic>. This applies also to the month of <italic>Teivis</italic>.</p>
<p>5) Since <italic>Rosh Chodesh Teives</italic> is sometimes only one day, that is, on the sixth day of <italic>Chanukah</italic>, when the sixth day of <italic>Chanukah</italic> is the first day of the month of <italic>Teives</italic> and the seventh day of <italic>Chanukah</italic> is the second day of <italic>Teives</italic>, and the eighth day of <italic>Chanukah</italic> is the third day of <italic>Teives</italic>, and at other times (<italic>Rosh Chodesh Teives</italic>) is two days, that is, on the sixth and seventh day of <italic>Chanukah</italic>, when the seventh day of <italic>Chanukah</italic> is the first day of <italic>Teives</italic>, and the eighth day (of <italic>Chanukah</italic>) is the second day of <italic>Teives</italic>. Therefore, one who has a <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> to observe on one of these days, should not err by calculating according to the days of <italic>Chanukah</italic>, for it must be calculated according to the day of the month.</p>
<p>6) On days that <italic>Tachanun</italic> is not said fasting should not be observed on the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic>. Also, on the day of a circumcision, the father, the <italic>Sandek</italic>, and the <italic>Mohel</italic> should not observe the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> fast.<sup><xref rid="fn1436">4</xref></sup> Also, on the day of redemption of the firstborn, the father and <italic>Kohein</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1437">5</xref></sup> should not observe the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> fast. Also, a bridegroom, during the wedding week, should not observe a <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> fast.<sup><xref rid="fn1438">6</xref></sup> But it is forbidden to partake of a meal at a <italic>Siyum</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1439">7</xref></sup> on the day of a <italic>Yahrzeit</italic>. On the days when fasting is not observed, he should at least devote his time to study Torah and to practice <italic>Mitzvos</italic> and good deeds to bring merit to the souls of his father and mother.</p>
<p>7) In the night preceding the day when one must observe <italic>Yahrzeit</italic>, he should not partake of a wedding meal, for there is music for the groom and bride and there is merriment. But to partake of a meal in honor of a circumcision, or the redemption of the firstborn or <italic>siyum</italic> is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn1440">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>8) If one does not know the date of his parent&#x2019;s death, he should select one day on which to observe the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> fast, but he may not encroach upon the rights of others with regard to reciting the <italic>Kaddish</italic>. &#x201C;He will swallow up death forever; and <italic>Adonoy</italic>, God will wipe away tears from all faces.&#x201D; &#x201C;Blessed be He who gives strength to the weary; and to Him who increases strength to the powerless.&#x201D;</p>
<ftnote id="fn1433">1. The <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 568:44 brings two opinions on this matter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1434">2. If he does not know which, he should fast on the second <italic>Adar</italic>. <italic>Sha&#x2019;ar Hatziyun</italic> 568:38.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1435">3. <italic>Maharik, Ramah</italic> etc., and this is the custom. If it is not too difficult, he should fast on both. If he vowed to fast on the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> he must fast on both. See <italic>Mogen Avraham, Gra, Mishnah Berurah</italic> 568:42.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1436">4. If they want, they may fast a half a day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1437">5. <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 568:46 <italic>Sha&#x2019;arei Teshuvah</italic> 568:19. But the <italic>Ponim Meiros</italic> 2:99 says the <italic>Kohein</italic> must fast.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1438">6. If either the groom or the bride are married for the first time. <italic>Mishna Berurah</italic> 550:12. He does, however, need an annulment of his vow to fast. <italic>Biur Halacha</italic> 559:9-<italic>Chochmas Shlomo</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1439">7. A <italic>Siyum</italic> is the completion of a <italic>Masechess</italic> of the Talmud. If he also took part in learning the <italic>Masechess</italic>, he may definitely partake of the meal at the <italic>Siyum. Maharam Shick</italic> Responsa <italic>Yoreh Deah</italic> 367.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1440">8. <italic>Mekom Shmuel</italic> Responsa 80. However, the <italic>Eliyohu Rabba</italic> 568 :15 forbids attending the meal of a circumcision.</ftnote>
