<p>As was the case with the earlier volumes in this series, much of the material presented in this volume originally appeared in my &#x201C;Survey of Recent Halakhic Periodical Literature&#x201D; which is regularly featured in the columns of <italic>Tradition</italic>. Many of those items have been expanded and amplified for presentation in their present form. Portions of this work served as the subject matter of <italic>shi&#x2019;urim</italic> and seminars on behalf of the students of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary and its <italic>Kollel le-Hora&#x2019;ah</italic> as well as of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.</p>
<p>This work is not intended to serve as a practical halakhic guide and, indeed, no attempt has been made to present definitive <italic>psak halakhah</italic>. It is devoted to an analysis of Halakhah and halakhic reasoning rather than to definitive statements of halakhic determinations. As such, it is directed primarily to those who have at least some background in the study of rabbinic literature but lack the requisite skills or the leisure to assimilate and analyze the maze of responsa pertaining to the topics treated in this volume. It is intended as an invitation to the reader to join in the noblest of Jewish activities and the supremest of joys &#x2013;&#x2013; the study of Torah.</p>
<p>I wish to express my thanks to my brother-in-law, Rabbi Mordecai Ochs, for his painstaking reading of the manuscript; to my son, Rabbi Dr. Moshe Bleich, for drawing my attention to sources that otherwise would have eluded me and for his many valuable insights; to Rabbi Moshe Shapiro, Mr. Zalman Alpert and Mr. Zvi Erenyi of the Mendel Gottesman Library for their constant helpfulness; to Mrs. Racheline Habousha of the library of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine for her unfailing graciousness in expediting my many requests; to Professor Richard White for making his scholarly expertise available at all times; to my secretary at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, Miss Kaaron Saphir, for her patience and understanding; to Mr. Erik L. Wilson for his assiduous assistance in my research and for his work on the index of this volume; to my esteemed friend, Mr. Ernest Grunebaum, for noting typographical errors in earlier publications of this material; and most especially to my granddaughter Hadassah Gurwitz whose thorough and meticulous proofreading and incisive observations have spared this work from many inadvertent errors; and last, but certainly not least, to my students for their relentless and provocative questioning.</p>
<p>My gratitude to the publisher of this series, the indefatigable Mr. Bernard Scharfstein, for his unfailing indulgence, good humor and patience as well as for his warm friendship spanning the decades of our relationship; my thanks also to Adam Bengal of Ktav Publishing House and Janice Weiss of TypeWorks for their painstaking efforts in shepherding the manuscript through the various stages of publication.</p>
<p>Above all, I am grateful to the Almighty for my cherished collaborators &#x2013;&#x2013; the members of my family. Our prayer to the Almighty is that we continue to be numbered among the <italic>mashkimim le-divrei Torah</italic> and, to paraphrase the words of the <italic>hadran</italic>, <italic>ke-shem she</italic>-&#x2018;<italic>azartanu le-sayyem sefer zeh, ken ta&#x2019;azrenu le-hat&#x1E25;il sefarim a&#x1E25;erim u-le-sayyemam, lilmod u-le-lamed, lishmor ve-la&#x2019;asot u-le-kayyem</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>The Torah of the Lord is perfect, it restores the soul</italic></p>
<p align="blockquote"><small>PSALMS</small> 19:8</p>
<p>Study of Torah is first and foremost a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>, indeed the most sublime of <italic>mi&#x1E93;vot</italic>. Study of Torah is itself the <italic>summum bonum</italic> to which man must aspire. But study of Torah is also many-faceted and multi-purposed. The Psalmist declares, &#x201C;The Torah of the Lord is <italic>temimmah</italic>, perfect; <italic>meshivat nafesh</italic>, it restores the soul.&#x201D;</p>
<p>What is the meaning of the phrase &#x201C;<italic>meshivat nafesh</italic>&#x201D;? The word from which the verb is derived is also the source of the term &#x201C;<italic>teshuvah</italic>,&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;repentance&#x201D; or &#x201C;return.&#x201D; Torah has the power to restore the souls of Jews who have departed from Judaism and, <italic>a fortiori</italic>, of those millions who have grown up in invincible ignorance bereft of instruction in the teachings of their faith. &#x201C;<italic>Temimmah</italic>&#x201D; has the connotation of &#x201C;whole&#x201D; or &#x201C;complete.&#x201D; Torah is not only an end in itself; it has restorative powers capable of rejoining fractured segments of a Jewish soul.</p>
<p>Sensitive <italic>mussar</italic> or exhortation and hortatorical prodding are no doubt effective instruments and serve to have the desired effect, at least for some. Spiritual warmth associated with the atmosphere of <italic>Shabbat</italic> and Holy Days, singing, dancing and ecstatic prayer generate a religious experience that is transformative, at least for some. Yet, among the ranks of Torah scholars there were those who regarded emphasis upon aught but Torah study with grave suspicion. They certainly did not deny that other experiences yielded at least limited results. But they remained suspicious of misplaced concentration on endeavors other than Torah study both because they believed that only Torah study has a durable effect and because of concern that a misplaced emphasis upon fear or emotionalism and ecstatic experience might result in subversion of the Jewish system of values.</p>
<p>An intelligent person thinks with his head rather than with his heart. Torah is entirely intellectual but it is the religious experience <italic>par excellence</italic> against which all other religious experiences fade into virtual insignificance. For many it is &#x201C;<italic>ha-ma&#x2019;or she-bah</italic>&#x201D; that is <italic>&#x201C;ma&#x1E25;aziran</italic> <italic>le-mutav&#x201D;</italic> (Palestinian Talmud, <italic>&#x1E24;aggigah</italic> 1:7 and <italic>Eikhah Rabbah</italic>, introduction, sec. 2), the illumination in the words of Torah that kindles their soul and returns them to the life for which they were destined.</p>
<p>Some years ago I was invited to address an academic forum. After my presentation, a distinguished-looking individual approached me and identified himself as a professor of medicine at a prestigious medical school. He further identified himself as a <italic>ba&#x2019;al teshuvah</italic> and proceeded to thank me profusely for having altered the course of his life. I was completely bewildered. I had never before met the gentleman and, although he later rose to prominence and his name would now be recognized by many readers of this volume, at the time, his name was unfamiliar to me. He explained that a number of people with whom he had a close personal relationship had endeavored to influence him to adopt an observant life-style. But, he explained, the experiences to which they had introduced him left him wanting, nor did the spectre of eternal damnation move him. He claimed that, as he was resolving to put aside his flirtation with Judaism, he came upon one of the volumes in this series. In it he discovered a dimension of Judaism of which he had been entirely ignorant. He was for the first time exposed to the penetrating insights, intellectual intricacies and subtle nuances of halakhic dialectic that are the quintessence of Torah and the source of unbounded challenge and delight. He discovered that there is more to Judaism than rituals, ethical maxims and pious platitudes. Gradually he became a changed person and an observant Jew.</p>
<p>For that transformation I take no credit; I served merely as the ventriloquist&#x2019;s dummy. This narrative serves only to underscore that the discussions and analyses presented in volumes such as these serve not only as their own end &#x2013;&#x2013; surely a noble enough purpose, in and of itself &#x2013;&#x2013; but as a potent instrument for making the profundities of Torah readily accessible to those who cannot otherwise slake a thirst of which they themselves are often not aware.</p>
<p>A second meaning is assigned to the term &#x201C;<italic>meshivat nefesh&#x201D;</italic> by Ibn Ezra and in an essay titled <italic>&#x201C;Torat ha-Shem Temimmah&#x201D;</italic> attributed to Ramban. Defining the term as &#x201C;answering&#x201D; or &#x201C;responding,&#x201D; they understood the verse as declaring that the Torah is perfect or complete in that it has the capacity to resolve questions and quell doubt.</p>
<p>Faith is not <italic>a priori</italic>. King David begins this psalm by declaring that the heavens proclaim the glory of God, i.e., that creation is testimony to the existence of a Creator &#x2013;&#x2013; an argument from design. According to Ibn Ezra, the verse presents a further and more powerful basis for faith. The Torah itself, when its depths are plumbed, reveals the presence of the divine lawgiver and becomes self-validating. The verse forms an argument from religious experience, but from intellectual, rather than emotional, experience.</p>
<p>Every age has witnessed the presence of both believers and doubters. Intellectual doubt and the questioning of fundamental beliefs have always been present in one form or another. It is nevertheless axiomatic that man has the ability to rise above such inner conflict and to experience faith. A just and beneficent God could not demand belief without bestowing upon man the capacity for faith. Abiding belief must, however, be firmly rooted in knowledge. Study has the unique effect of dispelling doubt. There is a story of a group of Jewish students in Berlin during the <italic>Haskalah</italic> period who, as a result of their encounter with secular society, began to experience religious doubts. Questioning the faith claims of Judaism, they were on the verge of rejecting fundamental theological beliefs. But before making a final break with Judaism they resolved to send one of their company to the Yeshiva of Volozhin, which at the time was the foremost Torah center of the world, to determine whether or not there existed satisfactory answers to the questions that troubled them. The young man to whom they delegated this task spent a period of time as a student in the Yeshiva and immersed himself completely in that academy&#x2019;s program of studies. Upon his return to Berlin he met with his friends who eagerly awaited his report. The young man described what he had seen and learned and related that he had never before experienced such intellectual pleasure. &#x201C;But,&#x201D; they demanded, &#x201C;have you brought answers to the questions which we formulated?&#x201D; &#x201C;No,&#x201D; he replied, &#x201C;I have brought no answers &#x2013;&#x2013; but the questions no longer plague me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Centuries ago, the Sages provided an explanation of this phenomenon. They depicted the Almighty as declaring, &#x201C;I have created an evil inclination but I have created the Torah as its antidote&#x201D; (<italic>Kiddushin</italic> 30b; <italic>Sifri</italic>, <italic>Parashat Eikev</italic> 11:18). With acquisition of Torah knowledge doubt recedes and ultimately dissipates. &#x201C;The Torah of the Lord is perfect,&#x201D; Torah responds to the questioning soul and provides release from gnawing doubt.</p>
<p>A third interpretation of the phrase &#x201C;<italic>meshivat nafesh&#x201D;</italic> is advanced by Rashi in his commentary on that verse. Rashi explains that the word &#x201C;<italic>meshivat&#x201D;</italic> is employed in another of the meanings of the root from which it is derived, <italic>viz</italic>., &#x201C;to restore.&#x201D; The Sages remark that, upon God&#x2019;s appearance at Sinai, the overpowering manifestation of His presence was more than corporeal beings could sustain. As a result, the souls of those assembled departed from their bodies; in effect, they died. However, subsequently, when revelation of the Torah occurred, their souls returned. &#x201C;The Torah of the Lord is perfect;&#x201D; words of Torah are restorative and have the power of revivification. Accordingly, the revealed words of Torah had the capacity to &#x201C;restore the soul&#x201D; of each person to the body it had earlier inhabited. The events that occurred at Sinai were supernatural and miraculous but the restorative powers of Torah are readily available and can be perceived by all.</p>
<p>Throughout the millennia, when Jews were beset with adversity and devastating loss, they were raised from life-draining despair and despondency by the curative power of Torah: &#x201C;If not Your Torah as my delight, I would then have been consumed by my afflictions&#x201D; (Psalms 119:92). That is true for Jews collectively and for Jews as individuals.</p>
<p>Sadness, grief and melancholy diminish life. The ability to achieve one&#x2019;s potential is severely compromised by bereavement. Throughout the entire period that Jacob believed Joseph to be dead he was deprived of contact with the Holy Spirit. Despondency prevents the ennobling force of the Holy Spirit from becoming manifest. Life itself becomes a burden. The antidote is Torah. Appreciation of previously unfathomed principles, elucidation of obscure concepts and formulation of novellae yield unparalleled satisfaction and intellectual thrill. In order to understand Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation of the verse a person must have suffered that type of grief and also have been privileged to have experienced the vistas of Torah study. The law of the Lord in its perfection restores life, bestows purpose and evokes joy.</p>
<p>As I wrote in the introduction to the first volume of this series thirty-five years ago, the Jew has always perceived God speaking to him through the leaves of the Gemara, from the paragraphs of the <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> and the words of the verses of the Bible. The Sages long ago taught, <italic>Kudsha Berikh Hu ve-Oraita &#x1E25;ad</italic>,&#x201D; God and the Torah are one; the Torah is the manifestation of divine wisdom. God reveals Himself to anyone who immerses himself in the depths of Torah; the intensity of the revelation is directly proportionate to the person&#x2019;s degree of penetration and perceptive understanding. To the scholar, a novel, illuminating insight affords a more convincing demonstration of the Divine Presence than a multitude of philosophical arguments. This is one &#x201C;variety of religious experience&#x201D; that William James did not encounter. It is a form of divine confrontation that must be experienced in order to be understood. Yet it is a relationship which every Jew may experience, at least <italic>be-ze&#x2019;er anpin</italic>, in minuscule form, through Torah study.</p>
<p>The present volume is designed not simply to relate halakhic principles to contemporary problems but, in the process of doing so, to &#x201C;restore the soul&#x201D; in each of the meanings of that phrase: to provide the intellectual gratification so sorely craved by a Jewish soul, to confirm both intellectually and experientially, the axiological foundations of Torah and to invite the reader to share in the most intense and sublime of all pleasures &#x2013;&#x2013; the study of Torah.</p>

<title><italic>Chapter I</italic> Torture and the Ticking Bomb</title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>All of Israel is commanded to rescue the pursued from the hand of the pursuer&#x2026;. If it is possible to rescue him by [destroying] one of the limbs of the pursuer, e.g., by smiting him with an arrow or a stone or a sword and cutting off his hand or breaking his foot or blinding his eye, one does so.</italic></p>
<p align="blockquote">RAMBAM, HILKHOT RO&#x1E92;EA&#x1E24; 1:6-7</p>
<p>To say that the issue of torture, even in extremely limited narrow circumstances, represents a moral dilemma is an understatement. Indeed, one approaches the topic with extreme hesitation. Certainly, any thinking person, any human being possessing even rudimentary moral sensitivity abhors torture in all its forms. In this regard the international conventions banning torture are no more than the expression of the lowest common moral denominator of the human race.</p>
<p>Torture deprives the victim of the essence of humanity; it strips a person of dignity and renders him or her bereft of autonomy. Freedom of will, reflected in personal autonomy, is the essence of the human condition. The effect of torture is a) to humiliate and degrade the victim and b) to destroy the victim&#x2019;s volitional freedom.</p>
<h1>I. <italic>The Legal History and the Contemporary Attitude</italic></h1>
<p>Historically, torture has been employed for a variety of purposes. At its most barbaric, torture has been utilized in a purely punitive or sadistic manner as, for example, when employed by victors against captives. At times, torture has been utilized in what may be described as a preventative or prophylactic manner as a means of intimidation. Thus, a ruler may seek to forestall future acts of treason by torturing political enemies. Similarly, an unstable regime may employ torture in order to terrorize political enemies. In such cases torture is used to intimidate. Those two types of torture, <italic>viz.</italic>, &#x201C;punitive torture&#x201D; and &#x201C;intimidative torture,&#x201D; are morally indefensible and repugnant in the extreme.</p>
<p>Equally odious, albeit sanctioned in the past by some societies, is judicial torture, i.e., torture designed to elicit a confession from a criminal who is indeed guilty.<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> Until relatively recent times, European criminal procedure was heavily dependent on the use of torture. The European law of proof emerged in the city-states of northern Italy in the thirteenth century and spread throughout Europe as part of the reception of Roman law. The European law of proof replaced proof by ordeal conducted under the auspices of the Church. Trial by ordeal purported to achieve certainty by having judgment rendered by the unerring Deity. That mode of proof was effectively terminated by a decision of the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215. With abolition of divine determination of guilt, a standard of proof had to be devised that would eliminate the possibility of human error.<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>For conviction of a crime punishable by death or maiming the European law of proof demanded testimony of two unimpeachable eyewitnesses. The parallel to the biblical two-witness rule is quite obvious. The practical problem that arises in applying that rule of proof is equally obvious: with such a high burden of proof conviction becomes virtually impossible. If the criminal justice system cannot punish perpetrators, crime is likely to become rampant. Jewish law recognizes that the two-witness rule is designed only for a society of righteous, law-abiding citizens for whom prescription of statutory punishment serves primarily as a pedagogic device. Jewish law provides that in an imperfect but real world criminals may be brought to justice either by application of the <italic>ad hoc</italic> emergency powers of the <italic>bet din</italic> or by imposition of the <italic>mishpetei ha-melekh</italic>, i.e., the king&#x2019;s justice designed to preserve the social fabric.<sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> The procedures employed in such cases permitted relaxation of the rules of evidence in relying upon a single witness and even upon circumstantial evidence.<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In European criminal law the problem was mitigated by virtue of the fact that, in addition to the testimony of two eyewitnesses, the confession of the defendant was accepted as proof of guilt. That law of proof could be effective only in cases of overt crime or repentant criminals. For the criminal law system to be effective, unrepentant criminals who committed clandestine crime had to be forced to confess. The law of torture emerged as a means of regulating the process of coercing a confession.</p>
<p>A procedure emerged that provided for examination under torture. A standard of &#x201C;probable cause&#x201D; was established as a prerequisite for examination of the suspect under torture in order to assure that only persons quite likely to be guilty would be subjected to the procedure. Probable cause consisted of either a single eyewitness or two items of circumstantial evidence, e.g., the suspect was seen departing the scene of the crime with a bloody dagger and the stolen loot. In theory at least, the confession was to contain details presumably known only to the perpetrator. In practice, leading questions as well as other devices provided the victim instruction with regard to the statement required of him. There was also a requirement that the confession be confirmed subsequent to removal of physical duress. However, the hapless victim realized full well that failure to confirm freely would only occasion return to the torture chamber.</p>
<p>Thus, in effect, torture was designed to confirm conclusions previously reached on the basis of circumstantial evidence. To be sure, the law of torture was often abused in execution and when employed in instances of flimsy or non-existent circumstantial evidence in extorting confessions from the innocent. At best, it was both superfluous and unreliable in confirming guilt already determined by other means.<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>It would be consistent with contemporary faith in the moral development of mankind during and after the age of the Enlightenment to believe that the great writers of that period, particularly Beccaria and Voltaire, shocked the conscience of Europe by exposing the inhumanity of torture and inspired the monarchs of Europe to abolish its practice. John Langbein, a legal historian, convincingly categorizes that view as a &#x201C;fairy tale.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup> Langbein establishes an entirely different causal nexus.</p>
<p>The rule of proof that gave rise to investigation under torture applied only to blood sanctions, i.e., death or maiming. The two-witness rule did not apply to sanctions imposed for lesser crimes that were punished by fines or minor corporal punishment. With the introduction of the galley sentence, the workhouse and incarceration as criminal sanctions it was possible to apply the same standard of proof to serious crime as had earlier been applied to petty crime with the result that torture became less significant for the administration of justice. Consequently, during the eighteenth century the system of judicial torture was gradually abolished in most European countries but nevertheless did survive in some few jurisdictions until early in the nineteenth century. By the beginning of the twentieth century, in a submission dated 1907, a contributor to the <italic>Encyclopedia Britannica</italic> was sufficiently confident that torture had been eradicated in Europe to write: &#x201C;The whole subject is now one of only historical interest as far as Europe is concerned.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Today, abhorrence of torture is emblematic of every civilized society. Jews, of all people, have profound historical cause to foster renunciation of torture in all its forms. From antiquity until the modern period Jews have repeatedly been singled out for all manner of cruelty at the hands of their oppressors. The forms of torture visited upon the <italic>asarah harugei malkhut</italic> who suffered martyrdom at the hands of the Romans, as so vividly described in both the <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> and <italic>Tisha be-Av</italic> liturgies, were replicated by crusaders, inquisitors and Cossacks. Jews continued to be prime victims of torture well beyond the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Toward the middle of the nineteenth century, at a time when most people had come to believe that the practice of torture had been consigned to the dustbin of history, Western society suffered a rude awakening as the result of an incident that profoundly affected the Jewish community, <italic>viz.</italic>, the Damascus affair of 1840.</p>
<p>A priest in Syria was found dead. Without a scintilla of evidence, Jews were accused of his murder. The political machinations that were contributing factors to the accusation are both complex and murky but the result was quite clear: a number of prominent members of the Jewish community were apprehended, held in prison and tortured until confessions were obtained. Reports of the affair reached Europe and civilized nations were appalled. They had assumed that the practice of eliciting confessions by means of torture had long since been abandoned. Torture might have been rampant in the Dark Ages but certainly could not endure in a modern enlightened age. Despite widespread acceptance of the ritual-murder myth, there was considerable agitation for the release of those hapless individuals. Prominent personages, including Sir Moses Montefiore in Britain and Adolphe Cr&#x00E9;mieux in France, became protagonists of the victims&#x2019; cause. Ultimately, the entirely innocent victims were released. Stories of unspeakable torture reaching Europe had been discounted as unbelievable but with the release of the victims the truth could no longer be suppressed. Eyes had been gouged and genitalia crushed. There had been multiple instances of children being tortured in order to force parents to confess.<sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup> Of course, in such circumstances victims will say anything demanded of them in the hope of avoiding further excruciating pain. As a result, the civilized world came to the stunning realization that not only is torture inconsistent with human sensibility but, moreover, confessions elicited pursuant to torture are meaningless and must be regarded as devoid of judicial probity.</p>
<p>Abhorrence of torture is certainly well-grounded and leads to a result that is entirely understandable and, in a certain sense, entirely correct. The result has been the formulation by the family of nations of a principle couched in the form of a Kantian moral imperative: All torture must be abjured; otherwise, there is no setting of boundaries. Such a reaction is entirely cogent despite the fact that in extreme cases such a principle may trigger application of the Latin maxim &#x201C;<italic>Fiat justitia et pereat mundus</italic>&#x201D;&#x2014;Let justice be done and let the world perish.&#x201D; Justice entails respect for human dignity and human dignity requires preservation of the integrity of individual autonomy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let justice be done&#x201D; is axiomatic and requires no validation. It is the second clause of the maxim&#x2014;&#x201C;and let the world perish&#x201D;&#x2014;that is problematic. It is the concept that this moral rule is universal in nature and hence applicable in any and all circumstances regardless of consequences that requires examination. The most striking challenge to the universal nature of the ban against torture lies in the example of the ticking bomb.</p>
<h1>II. <italic>The Ticking Bomb: Is It Different?</italic></h1>
<p>Considerations auguring against the earlier-described uses of torture are of no significance whatsoever with regard to the dilemma of torture and the ticking-bomb. Torture in the case of the ticking bomb is of an entirely different nature. It is neither punitive, intimidative nor judicial. It is designed neither to give vent to sadistic instincts, not to punish nor to set an example. It is designed purely and simply to elicit information and circumstances will rapidly demonstrate whether or not the information elicited in such a manner is accurate. Since it is designed to reveal information and is quite different in purpose from other forms of torture it can perhaps best be termed &#x201C;revelatory torture&#x201D; to distinguish it from the earlier described forms of torture.<sup><xref rid="fn9">9</xref></sup> This form of torture has been categorized by one writer as &#x201C;interrogational torture&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup> and the term has been recast by another as &#x201C;preventative interrogative torture.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup> The various forms of torture should not be confused. Arguments against, and sources decrying, other forms of torture cannot be applied <italic>mutatis mutandis</italic> to revelatory or preventative interrogative torture.</p>
<p>The most difficult moral dilemmas arise in situations in which moral imperatives come into conflict with one another. Judaism, unlike the common law system, posits a duty of rescue as a moral and halakhic imperative. &#x201C;Do not stand idly by the blood of your fellow&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:16), in its more obvious applications, requires rendering life-saving assistance in rescuing a potential drowning victim, helping a person escape from a conflagration, rendering medical assistance and even administration of CPR. In such situations recognition of a duty of rescue is hardly exceptionable.</p>
<p>A particularly vexing conflict between discharging a duty of rescue and a conflicting moral obligation might well occur in the case of a &#x201C;ticking bomb.&#x201D; Imagine a scenario in which a terrorist is known to have information regarding the location of a weapon of mass destruction, e.g., a chemical, biological or nuclear bomb, that has already been armed and is set to explode imminently. Explosion of the weapon will assuredly cause the death of countless thousands of innocent victims. Unspeakable tragedy can be averted only if the terrorist discloses where the bomb may be found so that it can be disarmed and rendered harmless in a timely manner. But the terrorist refuses to cooperate. May one morally apply physical duress rising to the level of torture in order to elicit essential information that will save thousands of innocent lives?</p>
<p>Some ethicists have taken the position that torture constitutes a <italic>malum per se</italic> that can never be sanctioned regardless of the consequences.<sup><xref rid="fn12">12</xref></sup> Absolutists assert that civilized people do not sanction torture and that a society that can be preserved only by resort to torture is not worth preserving. Their position is based upon deontological grounds rather than on assessment of consequences. For them, torture is inherently evil and can never be justified or excused.<sup><xref rid="fn13">13</xref></sup> Others present a slippery slope argument in contending that if torture is sanctioned in even the most egregious of circumstances the barrier posed by the moral and political taboo against torture will be shattered with the result that torture will no longer be perceived as noxious in situations in which grounds for resorting to torture are far less compelling.</p>
<p>Jurists typically point to the fact that torture is prohibited as a matter of international law by the Geneva Convention Against Torture, the European Convention on Human Rights and by the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The last of those conventions entered into force in 1987 and has since been ratified by more than 130 countries,<sup><xref rid="fn14">14</xref></sup> as well as by national statutes enacted by most democratic countries.</p>
<p>Other legal scholars adopt a variant posture in affirming that the rule of law must indeed be upheld and that, as a matter of law, torture can never, and should never, be sanctioned but, nevertheless, contend that, after the fact, society would be justified in failing to apply penal sanctions for violation of the law in exceptional circumstances.<sup><xref rid="fn15">15</xref></sup> The underlying notion is akin to that of jury nullification. A defendant may be guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt and the jury may be absolutely convinced of the guilt of the accused and nevertheless quite legitimately return a verdict of not guilty so that the defendant will escape punishment. A jury may do so simply because its members have come to believe that in the case before them the interests of justice are better served by withholding penal sanctions. A decision to employ torture might be ratified at any one of several stages in the judicial process: prosecutors might decline to press charges; the charge might be dismissed &#x201C;in the interest of justice;&#x201D; the jury might refuse to convict; the judge might mitigate or suspend punishment; and, finally, clemency always remains a final option.</p>
<p><italic>Post factum</italic> ratification of this nature serves to excuse the act but does not provide legal justification. Extralegal action, even if subsequently ratified, does not establish legal precedent for the future.</p>
<p>There is a striking precedent for such a moral stance in our contemporary judicial practice. For good reason, the various American jurisdictions have declined to legalize euthanasia. Yet in the few cases of mercy killing that have been brought to trial, by and large, juries have refused to convict or have found the defendant guilty of a lesser charge than homicide and, even when the defendant is found guilty, judges have mitigated the punishment.<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup> Thus the pristine moral value is preserved in theory while, when warranted, the harshness of its application is mitigated in practice.</p>
<p>Such a view does not really anticipate total proscription of torture. Instead, it would leave the decision in the hands of police interrogators, security officials or military commanders. In every particular case they would bear the responsibility of weighing the extent of potential harm against violation of their duty to abide by the provisions of law and of reaching an <italic>ad hoc</italic> determination. Such a policy anticipates that the powers that be will resort to torture only if they are convinced that their breach of legal norms is so obviously justified that no jury would impose criminal sanctions.</p>
<p>Inherent in that position is a certain measure of hypocrisy. The hypocrisy&#x2014;and indeed unfairness to the moral agent&#x2014;lies in unwillingness to provide clear guidelines in advance. And that position also fails to take into account the very real element of subjectivity on the part of members of a jury. Some juries may be comprised of legal purists who, enamored of the Roman law maxim, or of what they perceive as an <italic>a priori</italic> equivalent, believe that obedience to law is the supreme moral value. Accordingly, they may well ignore any and all countervailing considerations and extenuating circumstances and conclude that justice requires that all breaches of law be punished. On the other hand, an approach that does not sanction torture <italic>ex ante</italic> but allows for <italic>post factum</italic> ratification does have one positive aspect, <italic>viz</italic>., it does not require the law to sanction the unsanctionable but in egregious cases permits society to tailor its response to the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>There is, however, another possible moral response, one that is difficult to explain but that is nevertheless entirely cogent. In a system that posits an obligation of rescue, the ticking bomb situation poses a palpable dilemma. The obligation of rescue is a reflection of the mandate to preserve human life. The talmudic aphorism to the effect that a person who preserves a single life is regarded as if he has preserved the entire world (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 37a) is not hyperbole; it is a succinct and eloquent reflection of the value of human life in the hierarchical context of moral values. And precisely therein lies the essence of the dilemma. On the one hand, preservation of freedom is a fundamental value; torture designed to deprive an individual of human freedom is a denial of that value. On the other hand, a moral agent is bound by an obligation of rescue. All thinking moral persons recognize that we ought to preserve both autonomy of will and human dignity; all thinking moral individuals recognize a duty to preserve human life. Scrutiny of each of those principles separately gives rise to no disagreement whatsoever. The moral value of each principle is crystal clear. That is why ethicists prefer to qualify moral observations with a <italic>ceteris paribus</italic> clause, i.e., all things being equal, X is good and Y is evil. All things being equal, we ought to strive not only for preservation but for maximization of human dignity; all things being equal, we ought to respect individual autonomy; all things being equal, we ought to maximize preservation of human life. But in the real world all things are seldom, if ever, equal.</p>
<p>The case of the ticking bomb is a classic instance of the collision of two distinct and disparate moral values. The classic example is that of a fanatic who has set a hidden nuclear device to explode in the heart of a major metropolis and only he knows where the bomb has been secreted. The device has been timed to explode imminently with the result that there is no time to evacuate the innocent populace. A variation of the same dilemma involves a scenario in which a bomb has been placed in one of several hundred school buildings. It is impossible to evacuate all of the schools but only the terrorist knows which school has been targeted. In a post September 11th scenario, an airplane has been hijacked and it has been determined that terrorists plan to strike an unidentified skyscraper or government building. Only by torturing one of the accomplices can the authorities determine the targeted building so that it may be evacuated. In each of these examples torture is the only available means to elicit the information necessary to save innocent lives. Situations such as these require adjudication between competing values and a determination of which it is that must be assigned priority. The sheer enormity of the stakes involved compels our attention.</p>
<p>But the case of the ticking bomb is by no means the first instance in our history in which these values have come into conflict. Patrick Henry was one of the heroes of the American Revolution. At the time when the American colonies were in revolt against the British crown he proclaimed: &#x201C;Give me liberty, or give me death&#x0021;&#x201D; To this day the motto &#x201C;live free or die&#x201D; is engraved upon all automobile license plates issued by the state of New Hampshire.</p>
<p>What was Patrick Henry&#x2019;s credo? He recognized that preservation of human life is a moral desideratum and he also knew full well that if the revolution failed to achieve its stated goal the instigators would be hanged on the gallows as traitors to the Crown. But he also perceived the political institutions controlling his life and the lives of his fellow colonists as instruments for the effective denial of human freedom. The existing situation made it necessary to choose between two values; the choice was life versus human freedom. In Patrick Henry&#x2019;s calculus of values freedom was dominant and hence superior even to life itself.</p>
<p>Western society has, correctly or incorrectly, adopted the notion of human dignity as a paramount value and, at times, as even a greater value than life itself. It is that hierarchical ranking of values that constitutes the matrix against which many bioethical issues are adjudicated. &#x201C;Death with dignity&#x201D; has become a slogan employed not simply for preservation of human dignity even in death&#x2014;a value that cannot be gainsaid&#x2014;but for the sacrifice of longevity anticipation, whether brief and ephemeral or otherwise, i.e., the sacrifice of life itself for the sake of preservation of perceived dignity.</p>
<p>Little wonder, then, that when human dignity, personal autonomy and freedom of will come into conflict with preservation of life, even in situations in which there is a cognizable duty of rescue, Western society prefers the former over the latter. In the context of contemporary Western mores, the Geneva Convention&#x2019;s unequivocal and blanket ban on torture is not at all surprising. It is a global statement announcing that Western society stands firmly on the side of human dignity and personal autonomy as the encapsulation of the essence of the human condition. As such, those values are assigned priority over even life itself.</p>
<p>Moreover, in a strictly legal sense, arrival at that determination is not difficult because, even <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>, Western legal codes do not posit an obligation of rescue except in certain limited circumstances, e.g., an existing duty of care established on the basis of a contractual relationship.</p>
<p>Common law does not impose a duty to act as a Good Samaritan. A physician on his way to the golf course who comes upon the scene of a motor vehicle accident may refuse to stop without becoming subject to any penalty whatsoever. The duty of care is born of contract or of a special relationship; one does not, as a matter of course, owe a duty of rescue to a stranger. That remains the law in forty-eight of the fifty American states. The sole exceptions are Vermont and Minnesota. In Vermont, if a person is capable of rendering life-saving assistance and does not do so he is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine not in excess of &#x0024;100. Minnesota has enacted a similar law but in Minnesota human life is apparently regarded as twice as valuable since, in Minnesota, failure to render such assistance is punishable by a fine of up to &#x0024;200.</p>
<p>We live in a society which accepts as part of its common cultural system of values the notion that there is no absolute legal obligation to rescue a person whose life is in danger and in whose collective psyche is enshrined a concept of justice defined as a reflection of human dignity and personal autonomy. The various international conventions, which extend even to the case of the ticking bomb, do nothing more than record and apply the socio-moral norms commonly accepted by Western society.</p>
<p>Judaism has its own unique system of values and its own canons for resolving moral dilemmas. A Jew is referred to as an &#x201C;<italic>Ivri</italic>&#x201D; translated in the vernacular as a &#x201C;Hebrew.&#x201D; Why are Jews termed Hebrews? The conventional explanation is that it is because their ancestor Abraham hailed from &#x201C;<italic>ever ha-nahar</italic>&#x2014;the other side of the river [Euphrates].&#x201D; The Midrash, <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 42:13, indicates that the appellation has an entirely different connotation. Ideologically, the entire world stood on one side of the monotheism-polytheism conflict and Abraham stood alone on the opposing side. Inherent in that nugget of linguistic analysis is the proposition that, in moral controversies as well, it may be anticipated that the descendents of Abraham will be on &#x201C;the other side.&#x201D; Thus, it is not at all surprising that in debates concerning contemporary moral issues Jewish law and tradition compel conclusions at variance from those espoused by society at large.</p>
<h1>III. <italic>The Ticking Bomb and Jewish Law</italic></h1>
<h3>1. <italic>The Law of the Pursuer</italic></h3>
<p>In confronting the moral dilemma posed by the ticking bomb it must be candidly acknowledged that the values reflected in Jewish teaching and the comparative weight assigned to those values are not congruent with the mores unhesitatingly accepted by the dominant culture. Judaism posits a duty of rescue that is virtually absolute in nature. Not only does the duty of rescue compel intervention, it also reflects the paramount position Jewish law assigns to the preservation of life with the result that, when preservation of life comes into conflict with other values, it is preservation of life that must triumph.</p>
<p>The value assigned to preservation of innocent life is manifest in yet another provision of Jewish law applicable to resolution of the ticking bomb dilemma, <italic>viz</italic>., the law of the <italic>rodef</italic>. The term &#x201C;<italic>rodef</italic>&#x201D; is best translated as &#x201C;pursuer&#x201D; and refers to a would-be aggressor intent upon taking the life of his victim. In Jewish law, elimination of the <italic>rodef</italic> in order to save the life of the victim is not only permitted but is mandated. The rule is far broader than the principle of self-defense. A person whose life is threatened by another may exercise a right of self-defense; he may take the life of the aggressor in order to save his own life. However, although common law does allow for extension of the principle of self-defense in certain limited cases, e.g., a threat to the life of a spouse, self-defense is generally limited to the literal meaning of the term, i.e., to the defense of oneself. It does not apply to the rescue of a third party. Common law does not recognize a right, much less an obligation, to intervene in order to preserve the life of a stranger. Hence the claim that one was engaged in an act of rescue does not constitute a defense to a charge of homicide.</p>
<p>Refusal to justify such intervention is entirely consistent with the common law&#x2019;s failure to posit a duty of rescue. Since both the aggressor and the victim are strangers to whom no legally cognized duties are owed, the common law stance is readily understandable. One life is pitted against another; one or the other will surely die. Absent an obligation to rescue the putative victim why should the blood of one be deemed &#x201C;redder&#x201D; than the blood of the other? If there are no grounds to choose between two lives there is no rationale that serves to justify the sacrifice of one person for the sake of the second. The result is legally mandated non-intervention.</p>
<p>Jewish law, on the contrary, mandates intervention. Not only is intervention to rescue the victim a defense against homicide but failure to intervene constitutes violation of a biblical commandment. The biblical provisions surrounding the law of the pursuer are clearly designed to protect the putative victim. Hence the law of the pursuer must be seen as an amplification of the obligation of rescue. Primacy of the obligation of rescue requires even forfeiture of the life of the would-be perpetrator. Of course, invocation of the law of the pursuer in causing the pursuer&#x2019;s death is justified only if there is no other way to accomplish the necessary end and only if it can be established with the requisite degree of certainty that failure to intervene will result in loss of the victim&#x2019;s life.</p>
<p>Although such an element may well be present as well, the law of the pursuer should not be seen primarily as a vehicle for punishment of the pursuer. The intervenor does not act as a kangaroo court serving at one and the same time as prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner punishing a person who seeks to commit a crime. The law of pursuit is fully applicable even if the perpetrator is lacking in any measure of moral culpability whatsoever. The pursuer may have gone berserk; he may be demented, a mental incompetent or a child having no halakhic or legal capacity and yet he is regarded as a <italic>rodef</italic> against whom the law of the pursuer is fully operative.</p>
<p>In American folklore there is an anecdote concerning pioneers traveling along the Wilderness Road. In the early days of American history, long before the United States extended from &#x201C;sea to shining sea,&#x201D; there was a long period of westward migration. Settlers of the western territories were frequently attacked by Indians and ofttimes were forced to take refuge in hiding places in order to avoid discovery by Indian marauders. Apparently, in one such instance a baby began to wail. There was a distinct danger that the infant&#x2019;s cries would become audible to the enemy. In revealing the site in which the settlers were hiding, the infant would have compromised the safety of the entire group. In order to obviate the danger the child&#x2019;s mother placed her hand over the baby&#x2019;s nose and mouth causing him to suffocate. There was no other way to eliminate the threat caused by his cries.<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moral theologians may debate the applicability of a double-effect theory; ethicists may quarrel over the justification of sacrificing a single person in order to save many; jurists may ponder the cogency of a necessity defense; but to rabbinic scholars the moral imperative in such a situation is clear-cut and unequivocal.</p>
<p>A remarkably similar fact pattern is presented in a responsum published in a work devoted to halakhic problems that arose during the period of the Holocaust.<sup><xref rid="fn18">18</xref></sup> That responsum also concerns a crying baby; the parents and others were hiding in a bunker somewhere in occupied Europe rather than on the Cumberland Trail; the enemy were not Indians, but Nazis. The choice was simple but heart-wrenching: Does one allow the baby to continue crying and thereby reveal the presence of Jews who will face certain and imminent death or does one eliminate the threat by suffocating the baby?</p>
<p>In terms of categories established by Jewish law the baby has the status of a &#x201C;pursuer&#x201D; by virtue of the fact that it is engaged in conduct presenting a clear and certain danger to the lives of others. The infant intends no harm; no moral turpitude is entailed in the crying of a child; the child does not bear moral responsibility nor does he possess legal capacity. The infant is innocence personified. Nevertheless, the child&#x2019;s acts, albeit unintentional, endanger others, and that factor, in and of itself, renders the law of the pursuer operative.</p>
<p>How is the operation of the law of the pursuer in such an instance to be understood? Certainly not in terms of the number of lives saved as balanced against the number of lives sacrificed. The ticking bomb example is generally presented as a hypothetical situation in which the lives of countless numbers of individuals are about to be extinguished but the identical issues would be present even if but a single life were at stake. Judaism regards every life as endowed with infinite value. As schoolchildren we were taught that infinity added to infinity equals infinity. I now understand that in certain esoteric mathematical applications some infinites are greater than others, but in the moral realm all infinities remain equal. The rules and principles that apply with regard to preserving countless lives apply with equal force to saving a single life.</p>
<p>But, if so, how can the taking of one life in order to save that of another be justified? Why must one prefer the life of the victim over the life of the aggressor, particularly when the aggressor is completely without guilt? Quite apparently, the law of the pursuer reflects a simple principle, <italic>viz</italic>., society must take whatever measures may be necessary in order to eliminate violence. Whether or not the perpetrator has legal or even moral culpability is completely irrelevant. Violence is violence and members of society are individually and collectively charged with eradicating violence. The law of the pursuer is most readily understood as the embodiment of a divinely announced policy principle. The reason or reasons that serve to explain why the Torah enshrines elimination of violence in the law of the pursuer as a policy principle need not be belabored. The reasons are probably manifold and certainly subject to analysis and discussion but ultimately they are of little consequence since the moral values of Judaism are normative simply by virtue of the fact that they are declared as such by the Torah and enshrined in Halakhah as revealed at Sinai.</p>
<h3>2. <italic>Passive Pursuit</italic></h3>
<p>The terrorist with knowledge of a ticking bomb might well be labeled a <italic>rodef</italic> but for one potentially salient point: A <italic>rodef</italic>, defined literally, is a person intent upon an overt act of violence. The terrorist in the ticking bomb scenario is not necessarily the person who armed the bomb or who was associated in any overt manner with preparation for the act of violence. He may be guilty only of failure to reveal information necessary to thwart the plotting; as such, his involvement is entirely passive. Is the law of the pursuer limited to persons engaged in overt acts or does it extend as well to persons causing harm, or who allow harm to take place, simply by means of passive nonfeasance?</p>
<p>An answer to that question may be gleaned from analysis of a ruling recorded in the Palestinian Talmud, <italic>Terumot</italic> 8:10. The situation discussed involves a group of travelers surrounded by marauders who deliver an ultimatum: &#x201C;Give us one of [your company] or we will kill all of you&#x0021;&#x201D; It is clear that the person to be delivered is marked for death. The ruling is unequivocal: &#x201C;Even if they will all be killed let them not deliver a single Jewish life.&#x201D; The rule formulated by the Palestinian Talmud may otherwise be expressed as &#x201C;Better two deaths than one murder.&#x201D; Better to allow everyone to be put to death rather to become complicit in a single act of homicide. That rule precludes a person not only from serving as the proximate cause of the death of an innocent individual but also from remotely or indirectly contributing to the death of such a victim. The number of lives to be lost as a result is irrelevant. In this case the law resonantly declares, &#x201C;<italic>Fiat justitia et pereat mundus</italic>.&#x201D; Justice requires that one not be complicit in an act of homicide even if the entire world will perish as a result. That rule applies even if refusal to participate in homicide will contribute to even greater loss of life. In the case discussed in the Palestinian Talmud the demand was for a single member of a group; failure to comply would result in extermination of the entire group, including the designated individual.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Talmud relates this rule to the seemingly contradictory narrative recorded in II Samuel 20:14-22. Sheba the son of Bichri was guilty of <italic>l&#x00E8;se majest&#x00E9;</italic> and King David ordered his execution. David&#x2019;s soldiers surrounded the city in which Sheba the son of Bichri sought refuge and ordered the inhabitants to surrender the fugitive upon pain of themselves being collectively put to death. Delivery of Sheba the son of Bichri was regarded as acceptable and was found not to have violated the rule enunciated by the Palestinian Talmud. Two conflicting explanations are formulated in distinguishing the case of Sheba the son of Bichri. Resh Lakish maintains that the townsfolk acted correctly because the designated victim was indeed culpable by virtue of having committed a capital crime. In effect, his execution could not be considered culpable homicide. The conflicting opinion of R. Yo&#x1E25;anan maintains that not only may a culpable individual be surrendered but that any other person might also be delivered to death in similar circumstances. According to the latter opinion the crucial factor in the case of Sheba the son of Bichri is that the choice of whom to deliver was not made by the townspeople but by those demanding his life. The crucial distinguishing factor, according to this view, is specification of the victim. In effect, the community cannot select one of their number for death of their own accord because they have no right to prefer one person over another. But when relieved of that burden by virtue of the fact that the selection has been made by others they may deliver the victim in order to spare the community.</p>
<p>The opinion of Resh Lakish requiring that the person delivered be criminally culpable is not difficult to understand. The victim is not only already a marked man, he is also deserving of his fate. Hence, what difference does it make how he meets his death? The second opinion, however, requires clarification. What rationale serves to establish specification by others as exculpation from homicide? Assuredly, specification by the perpetrator does not transform an innocent victim into a guilty party. If so, those who deliver the specified victim to death are abetting an act of homicide.</p>
<p>One incisive analysis is predicated upon recognition of the designated victim on having become, precisely by virtue of his antecedent designation for death, a <italic>rodef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>On first analysis, categorization of the designated victim as a <italic>rodef</italic> is difficult to comprehend. The designated victim is pursuing no one; he harbors no malevolent intentions whatsoever. He has done and is doing nothing at all. In truth, he himself is an entirely innocent victim. Through no fault of his own he happens to have fallen into the bad graces of a thoroughly evil person or persons who will not hesitate to kill others in order to take the life of the designated victim as well. The intended victim endangers others by virtue of being in a particular place at a particular time. It is his mere existence, the fact that he is living and breathing, that endangers others. Nevertheless, according to this opinion, he is categorized as a <italic>rodef</italic> and the law of the pursuer applies because his very presence among the group endangers the lives of others.</p>
<p>On this analysis it becomes apparent that the law of the pursuer is applicable even in instances in which the &#x201C;pursuer&#x201D; is not engaged in an overt act of aggression; the law of the pursuer is equally applicable in situations in which mere passive existence gives rise to danger to others.<sup><xref rid="fn20"> 20</xref></sup></p>
<p>To be sure, in the case of the ticking bomb it is not the physical existence of the recalcitrant terrorist that poses the danger but the terrorist&#x2019;s failure to speak. The passivity of non-feasance is even more pronounced then the passivity of existence. Nevertheless, the notion that passive nonintervention is encompassed within the law of the pursuer is assumed as a matter of course by R. Naphtali Zevi Judah Berlin in this commentary on <italic>She&#x2019;iltot de-Rav A&#x1E25;a&#x2019;i Ga&#x2019;on</italic>, <italic>Ha&#x2019;amek She&#x2019;elah</italic>, <italic>She&#x2019;ilta</italic> 142:9. Judges 21:5 records that any person who might fail to appear in order to participate in the action taken against the tribe of Benjamin would be put to death. <italic>Ha&#x2019;amek She&#x2019;elah</italic> asserts that the culpability of those individuals stemmed from the law of the pursuer. Failure to join in the disciplinary action of the community, he asserts, would expose fragmentation within the nation and strengthen the resolve of the external enemies. Strengthening the hand of the enemy even by purely passive nonfeasance, according to <italic>Ha&#x2019;amek She&#x2019;elah</italic>, renders such an individual a pursuer.</p>
<p>Once it is recognized that a prospective act of commission is not required to trigger the law of the pursuer it may well be argued that refusal to divulge information necessary to countermand the lethal effect of an already committed act similarly constitutes an act, albeit a passive one, of pursuit. By failing to act the potential informant makes it possible for a calamity to occur. If so, he is a pursuer who may be eliminated in order to preserve the lives of potential victims.</p>
<p>Obviously, killing the very person who possesses crucial information necessary to save the lives of intended victims would defeat the very purpose of the law of pursuit. Dead people cannot talk and the information available during the lifetime of such a person would be carried to the grave and become irretrievably lost. Indeed, since the victims would not be rescued by eliminating the pursuer, the pursuer dare not be killed because killing the pursuer cannot be justified in situations in which the victim is doomed in any event. But the law of the pursuer provides for far more than the elimination of the pursuer; the law of pursuit requires thwarting the nefarious intent of the pursuer by any means possible. Indeed, killing the pursuer constitutes a capital offense if rescue can be accomplished in a less onerous manner, e.g., by maiming the pursuer and thereby incapacitating him. The talmudic example is a situation in which the victim can be rescued by cutting off one of the limbs of the pursuer. In effect, the law of the pursuer allows only such force as is required to eliminate the threat. It is thus clear that the law of pursuit sanctions any form of bodily force, including mayhem, when necessary to preserve the life of the victim.</p>
<p>There is one significant limitation upon invoking the law of the pursuer in the context of a terrorist believed to be in possession of information, namely, the requirement for a threshold level of certainty that loss of innocent life will ensue if no intervention occurs. In the case of the ticking bomb the issue that it is bound to arise is whether or not there exists the requisite degree of certainty that the suspect possesses such information and that revealing such information will serve to avert the impending calamity.<sup><xref rid="fn21">21</xref></sup></p>
<h3>3. <italic>Intractable Pain</italic></h3>
<p>It might be contended that, although the law of the pursuer warrants mayhem and even sacrifice of a limb, nevertheless torture involving insufferable pain is inhumane and more onerous than death and hence cannot be sanctioned under any circumstances. The argument would be that only measures up to and including death of the pursuer are sanctionable but torture is inhuman in the extreme and even worse than death. That argument is readily rebutted by reference to the law governing martyrdom as understood by virtually all early-day talmudic commentators. The Book of Daniel 3:12-23 recounts that Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, identified by the Gemara as Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, allowed themselves to be cast into a fiery cauldron rather than accede to the demand of Nebuchadnezzar that they worship an idol. The Gemara, <italic>Ketubot</italic> 33b, observes that, although those personages accepted martyrdom with equanimity, &#x201C;had they been tortured they would have worshipped the idol.&#x201D; Those commentators are uniform in assuming that the Gemara is not gratuitously and without evidence impugning the devotion of Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah or questioning their mettle in resisting duress. Instead, they understand the Gemara as declaring that, under the given circumstances, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah would have been under no obligation to accept torture. But why not? The most obvious answer would be that, although Halakhah requires martyrdom on behalf of monotheism, it regards torture as even more onerous and does not require acceptance of torture as well. That is indeed the resolution offered by one anonymous early-day authority in order not to compromise that cardinal principle.<sup><xref rid="fn22">22</xref></sup> However, that view is an individual opinion and is implicitly rejected by a host of other authorities who address the problem and propose entirely different solutions.<sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup> It is thus clear that the consensus of halakhic opinion is that, when martyrdom is required, acceptance of torture is required as well. Since there is no provision in Jewish law mandating acceptance of any sanction more severe than death, it follows that Jewish law does not regard torture as more onerous than death.<sup><xref rid="fn24">24</xref></sup> By the same token, it follows that when preventative measures, including mayhem and death, may be imposed in order to restrain a pursuer, torture may be employed as well.</p>
<h3>4. <italic>Frustration of a Criminal Act</italic></h3>
<p>In a ticking bomb scenario in which the terrorist was himself a participant in the fashioning and arming of the bomb use of torture can be justified on other grounds as well. Jewish law provides for physical duress in order to secure compliance with biblical mandates. In constructing and arming the bomb the terrorist has completed the physical act that will render him culpable for homicide upon the death of the victim or victims; the effect of that act is delayed by the timing device with the result that there exists a window of opportunity for canceling or rescinding the act.</p>
<p>Legal systems tend to treat equally those whose acts create harm and those whose acts create only the potential for harm but who later fail to intervene in order to prevent the actualization of such harm. A comparable halakhic example is the situation in which, on <italic>Shabbat</italic>, a person has placed dough in an oven or water on a stove. The physical act of Sabbath desecration is complete but there is no actual desecration until the bread becomes baked or the water becomes heated. In the interim period the dough or the water may be removed thereby rendering the earlier act innocuous. Just as duress may be applied <italic>ab initio</italic> in order to restrain a person from transgression,<sup><xref rid="fn25">25</xref></sup> a person may be compelled to perform an act necessary to thwart the effect of an earlier proscribed act and thereby retroactively render that act innocuous. Thus, a person who, on the Sabbath, has placed bread in an oven or water on a stove may be forcibly compelled to remove the bread before it becomes baked or the water before it becomes heated. Quite similarly, a person who has attached a timing device to a bomb may be compelled by force, or even torture, to neutralize that act or to enable others to neutralize that act before it achieves fruition as an act of homicide.</p>
<h3>5. <italic>The Obligation of Rescue</italic></h3>
<p>The same line of reasoning yields an identical result even in cases in which the terrorist was not at all complicit in constructing or arming the bomb but merely possesses detailed knowledge of the actions of others. To be sure, in such a situation the terrorist has performed no illicit act that he must be compelled to frustrate and thereby render innocuous. Although the terrorist may himself have done no harm and have caused no danger, he nevertheless has an obligation of rescue. The terrorist, no less so than other persons, has a duty to save endangered lives. He, too, is commanded &#x201C;Thou shalt not stand idly by the blood of your fellow&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:16). And Jewish law provides that people can be compelled to discharge biblically mandated duties.</p>
<p>Fulfilling positive obligations and avoiding negative transgressions frequently requires expenditure of funds. A person is required&#x2014;and may be compelled&#x2014;to expend his entire fortune in order to avoid transgression of a negative commandment, e.g., in order to obtain kosher food rather than resorting to eating forbidden food in order to sustain life.<sup><xref rid="fn26">26</xref></sup> According to some authorities, a person is required to expend no more than a tenth of his net worth,<sup><xref rid="fn27">27</xref></sup> and for others no more than a fifth of his assets,<sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> in order to fulfill a positive commandment, e.g., to acquire the four species for use on <italic>Sukkot</italic>.</p>
<p>The duty of rescue is couched in negative rather than positive terms: &#x201C;Thou shalt not stand idly by the blood of your fellow.&#x201D; Ostensibly, expenditure of one&#x2019;s entire fortune should be required, if necessary, in order to avoid transgressing a negative commandment that will perforce occur if one were to &#x201C;stand idly by&#x201D; and fail to provide needed assistance. Such is indeed the position of many authorities. Others maintain that the disparity in the financial burden to be assumed is not dependent upon a negative versus a positive linguistic formulation of the obligation but upon whether the otherwise ensuing transgression is active or passive. According to that analysis, overt transgression of any commandment is to be eschewed, literally at all costs, even if the commandment is expressed in the passive voice while avoidance of a passive transgression requires expenditure of only one-tenth or one-fifth of one&#x2019;s resources even if the commandment is expressed negatively. An obvious example of the latter is the commandment &#x201C;Thou shall not stand idly by the blood of thy fellow.&#x201D; The injunction, in its formal sense, is a negative commandment yet it is transgressed by simple nonfeasance.</p>
<p>Other than with regard to the three cardinal transgressions, avoidance of violation of a commandment does not require sacrifice of more than a person&#x2019;s entire fortune. Consequently, the duty of rescue certainly does not require expenditure of more than a person&#x2019;s entire fortune. For that reason a person need not sacrifice a limb or an organ in order to rescue another individual since a rational person would expend his entire fortune to avoid such loss. For the same reason a person need not accept physical pain or emotional anguish that he would willingly pay such sums in order to avoid. However, infliction of physical pain below that threshold level is warranted as a means of compelling the obligation of rescue.<sup><xref rid="fn29">29</xref></sup> Accordingly, imposition of physical pain up to that magnitude would be justified in the case of the ticking bomb.</p>
<h3>6. <italic>Personal Autonomy</italic></h3>
<p>Quite apart from the foregoing, in terms of Jewish tradition and teaching, torture in the case of the ticking bomb does not really present a moral dilemma arising from the collision of opposing moral values. According to Jewish teaching, the conflict between preservation of life versus preservation of individual autonomy and human dignity in such a situation is apparent rather than real. There are a limited number of situations in which Jewish law demands freely-willed acquiescence in the performance of an act but at the same time sanctions physical duress to secure assent. The primary example lies in compelling a recalcitrant husband to execute a bill of divorce in instances in which Jewish law recognizes the wife&#x2019;s right to demand a divorce. The fact that the <italic>get</italic> is halakhically mandated does not mitigate the halakhic requirement that the divorce be executed only pursuant to the free-will directive of the husband. Halakhah provides that, in such circumstances, a recalcitrant husband may be subjected to physical pain until he signifies acquiescence by declaring &#x201C;I wish it.&#x201D; Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Geirushin</italic> 2:20, in a departure from his usual wont in composing the <italic>Mishneh Torah</italic>, enters into a philosophical excursus in order to dispel the obvious paradox. If a <italic>get</italic> may be compelled in such cases, why the need for pronouncement of the verbal formula &#x201C;I wish it?&#x201D; And if an autonomous will is required in such circumstances, how can a declaration made under physical duress possibly be accepted as evidence of a freely willed act?</p>
<p>Rambam dispels the paradox by asserting that the human psyche is multi-layered. Every Jew wishes to fulfill his obligation to obey the commandments of the Torah as that obligation is accurately declared to him by competent rabbinic authorities. That is his innermost will. But it is not the only facet of his psyche. Man is also possessed of an &#x201C;evil inclination,&#x201D; which is simply a cognomen for the corporeal nature of man, and hence is subject to lust, desire, spite and a host of other emotions. Man&#x2019;s corporeal nature often causes him to desire that which he is commanded to abjure and to shrink from performance of an act he is duty-bound to perform. A person&#x2019;s evil inclination may cause him to desire things that another part of his psyche, the good intention or the spiritual component of his being, knows to be wrong and finds abhorrent. Quite often the two components of the psyche are at war with one another and not frequently the evil inclination achieves dominance.</p>
<p>Halakhah, according to Rambam, recognizes that a person acts freely only when the &#x201C;evil inclination&#x201D; acquiesces in the desire of the deeper, more fundamental inner will. But the evil inclination is concerned solely with pleasure, sensual gratification and the like, all of which are forms of physical well-being. Pleasure and pain are antagonistic forces. The evil inclination lusts after pleasure but abhors pain. Pleasure may be desirable but not if accompanied by a commensurate degree of pain. Thus, the desire of the evil inclination for sensual gratification is readily cancelled by generating a situation in which the evil inclination rapidly determines that, on balance, there is no sensual profit in continued pursuit of the particular gratification in question and, consequently, the evil inclination quite readily renounces the pursuit of that desire. The net result is that the evil inclination no longer presents an impediment to realization of the desire of the inner will. Cooption of the evil inclination results in realization of complete autonomy. Thus, in terms of Jewish teaching, physical duress designed to assure compliance with divine law does not at all compromise individual autonomy. Quite to the contrary, it serves to eliminate impediments to expression of that autonomy.</p>
<h1>IV. <italic>Non-Jews and the Ticking Bomb</italic></h1>
<h3>1. <italic>The Law of the Pursuer</italic></h3>
<p>The foregoing reflects the position of Jewish law and tradition as it pertains to Jews. Non-Jews, however, are not bound by the 613 precepts of the Sinaitic covenant; they are subject only to observance of the Seven Commandments of the Noahide Code. The Noahide Code does not posit a duty of rescue. Thus, common law and Western legal systems, which do not establish a legal requirement to act as a Good Samaritan, are consistent with Jewish teaching as addressed to non-Jews. It stands to reason that, if there is no duty of rescue, any attempt to elicit information, even of lifesaving potential, is nothing other than an illicit battery. Hence it might appear that international conventions banning torture are consistent with the universalistic aspect of Jewish teaching as it applies to the nations of the world.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, such a conclusion would not be correct. The law of the pursuer is integral to the Noahide Code. Some authorities contend that a Noahide, no less so than a Jew, is duty-bound to intervene in order to eliminate a pursuer;<sup><xref rid="fn30">30</xref></sup> others assert that a Noahide is not obligated to eliminate the pursuer but that nevertheless a Noahide has full discretion to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn31">31</xref></sup> Unlike the common law, the Noahide Code grants license to all persons to prevent acts of violence targeted against innocent victims even in the absence of a duty of care on the part of the intervener <italic>vis &#x00E0;-vis</italic> the putative victim. Thus, although the Noahide Code does not require a physician to stop at the site of a motor vehicle accident for the purpose of rendering life-saving assistance, he may, and for some authorities, he must, intervene in order to prevent an act of violence. Reflected in those provisions is undoubtedly the consideration that elimination of violence constitutes a societal concern of a magnitude even higher than that of preservation of human life.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a non-Jewish terrorist intent upon an act of aggression may be thwarted by any available means. Similarly, if he has armed a bomb he may be compelled by force to neutralize that threat or to reveal the information needed to enable others to do so.</p>
<h3>2. Dinin</h3>
<p>Torture of a completely innocent non-Jew who by happenstance has come into possession of information regarding the location of a ticking bomb designed to compel disclosure of that information is an entirely different matter. Such an individual is not a pursuer; as a non-Jew he has no obligation of rescue. Hence there is no duty incumbent upon him that he may be compelled to discharge against his will. If so, ostensibly, torture of such a person should be regarded as an illicit battery.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the limited situation of an innocent non-Jew in possession of information regarding a ticking bomb there is license, and perhaps even an obligation, to apply torture, if necessary, in order to elicit the requisite information. Sanction for such a procedure may be derived from the last in the list of the seven Noahide commandments, <italic>viz</italic>., <italic>dinin</italic> or &#x201C;laws.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As formulated by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Melakhim</italic> 9:14, the essence of the commandment of <italic>dinin</italic> is an obligation to bring to justice violators of the first six of the Noahide commandments. Perpetrators must be punished; accordingly, Noahide societies have an obligation to establish a judicial system, to bring transgressors to justice and to impose capital punishment. Those obligations devolve upon society as a whole and upon each and every member of society. Rambam advances this analysis of <italic>dinin</italic> in conjunction with his elucidation of a particularly vexatious biblical narrative. Genesis 34 records the abduction and violation of Dinah by Shechem the son of Hamor. Her brothers, Simeon and Levi, responded not by simply executing the perpetrator but by annihilating all the people of Shechem as well. Rambam asserts that the townspeople &#x201C;saw and knew&#x201D; what Shechem had done but failed to bring him to justice. Failure to punish the culprit, according to Rambam, is also a violation of the commandment of <italic>dinin</italic> and hence constitutes a capital offense. Failure to punish the perpetrator, according to Rambam, is as heinous as commission of the transgression.</p>
<p>According to Rambam, there is yet another duty imposed upon Noahides by virtue of the commandment of <italic>dinin</italic>. Rambam declares that courts must be established in order to judge violators and also &#x201C;<italic>le-hazhir et ha-am</italic>&#x2014;to admonish the populace.&#x201D; The commandment of <italic>dinin</italic> not only establishes a duty to punish but also imposes another obligation as well, <italic>viz</italic>., to prevent nefarious deeds before their inception. Rambam is clearly enunciating the position that Noahide courts are endowed with the power of injunctive relief which they must exercise in order to prevent crime.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that the commandment of <italic>dinin</italic> imposes obligations not only upon society at large but upon individuals as well. Thus, there exists both a collective and an individual obligation to prevent crimes from being committed. Accordingly, in the ticking bomb scenario, although the potential informant may be innocent of any wrongdoing and not be bound by a duty of rescue, he nevertheless has an obligation to prevent a crime from taking place. Hence he can be compelled to divulge the information necessary to effect that end. Since society has a selfsame obligation it may force him to divulge that information.</p>
<p>The commandment of <italic>dinin</italic> is a commandment to do justice and to assure that the interests of justice are served. In order to establish a just society evildoers must be punished and crime must be prevented.</p>
<h1>V. Hora&#x2019;at Sha&#x2019;ah <italic>and Constructive Torture Warrants</italic></h1>
<p>Application of the law of the pursuer serves only to justify duress applied to a person responsible in some sense for the impending calamity even if the responsibility lies only in failure to communicate information needed to avert a disaster. It cannot be invoked to justify torture of a totally uninvolved innocent individual as a means of indirectly bringing pressure to bear upon the person in possession of the requisite information. The most obvious example lies in torture of a terrorist&#x2019;s spouse, parent or child in anticipation that the terrorist, who might be willing himself to accept such torture, will not allow a loved one to suffer a similar fate. Such an innocent and ignorant party simply cannot be defined as a pursuer.</p>
<p>Miriam Gur-Aryeh<sup><xref rid="fn32">32</xref></sup> has pointed out that acceptance of a necessity defense&#x2014;a possibility impliedly recognized in a 1999 decision of the Supreme Court of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn33">33</xref></sup>&#x2014;would indeed serve <italic>post factum</italic> to justify torture even of totally innocent parties. It is precisely for that reason that she takes issue with employment of the doctrine of necessity by the Israeli court. The law of the pursuer, although not dependent upon moral or legal culpability, is predicated upon elimination of an evil; an innocent, uninvolved and ignorant bystander is neither actively nor passively engaged in an evil act. The notion of necessity involves acceptance of a lesser evil in order to avoid a greater evil. Application of the doctrine of necessity is not only consistent with recognition of torture as a <italic>malum per se</italic> but is actually born of recognition and acceptance of the evil nature of the act. The aspect of necessity arises, misguidedly or otherwise, from an assessment that grievous harm done to one person will rescue a multitude. If so, the mechanism for averting the calamity is irrelevant; whether the person harmed is innocent or guilty is of no consequence; and whether the source of the threat is directly eliminated by means of that harm or whether the harm is only indirectly and tangentially related to the rescue has no bearing whatsoever upon the notion of necessity.</p>
<p>Absent a duty of rescue on the part of the potential torture victim or if the torture under consideration is so onerous as to be equated with expenditure of more than the victim&#x2019;s entire fortune, there seems to be no way that Jewish law might recognize a principle analogous to the doctrine of necessity. Yet a parallel may be found in one source. The thesis is highly novel and probably not reflective of mainstream halakhic opinion and, although in a formal sense it involves a rather different principle, that thesis is indeed analogous to the doctrine of necessity.</p>
<p>Similarly, Alan Dershowitz&#x2019; proposal that torture be sanctioned in certain limited circumstances such as the case of the ticking bomb but only pursuant to obtaining advance judicial approval in the form of a &#x201C;torture warrant&#x201D; from an appropriate oversight body<sup><xref rid="fn34">34</xref></sup> is not without precedent in Jewish law. Indeed, the dual notions of &#x201C;necessity&#x201D; and &#x201C;torture warrants&#x201D; appear in the same source.</p>
<p>The Book of Esther records that, upon being informed of the decree issued by Ahasuerus for the annihilation of the entire Jewish people, Esther risked her own life in presuming to appear before the king without a royal summons. Putting aside the issue of self-endangerment, Esther&#x2019;s act was halakhicly problematic. According to rabbinic tradition, Esther presented herself for the purpose of a conjugal assignation in the course of which she sought to present her petition. However, according to the same rabbinic tradition, Esther was actually the wife of Mordecai. Her earlier liaisons with Ahasuerus were indeed acts of adultery but permitted to her because of duress.<sup><xref rid="fn35">35</xref></sup> On this occasion she willingly and voluntarily made herself available to Ahasuerus for an adulterous act. Her conduct was sanctioned by Mordecai as a <italic>hora&#x2019;at sha&#x2019;ah</italic>, or <italic>ad hoc</italic> emergency measure, necessary for the salvation of the people of Israel. The biblical paradigm for a <italic>hora&#x2019;at sha&#x2019;ah</italic> is found in the narrative of Elijah and the sacrifices he offered on Mount Carmel in order to discredit the prophets of Baal. Mordecai and the Sanhedrin had the power to issue a <italic>hora&#x2019;at sha&#x2019;ah</italic> in order to prevent the annihilation of the entire Jewish people.</p>
<p>R. Abraham Isaac Kook, <italic>Mishpat Kohen</italic>, no. 143 and no. 144, secs. 6-8, asserts that not only adultery but even bloodshed is permitted on an emergency <italic>ad hoc</italic> basis for the purpose of preserving the entire Jewish people.<sup><xref rid="fn36">36</xref></sup> That power is inherent, he contends, in the authority to promulgate a <italic>hora&#x2019;at sha&#x2019;ah</italic>, or <italic>ad hoc</italic> emergency directive, in emergency situations. Rabbi Kook, however, acknowledges that authority for such action is limited to situations in which the entire Jewish people, or perhaps only the entire populace of the Land of Israel, are threatened but does not extend to imminent destruction of a single community. If so, in practical terms, his thesis is applicable only when the threat is of the magnitude of a nuclear holocaust.</p>
<p>Of course, the question of which individual or group of individuals has the authority to promulgate a <italic>hora&#x2019;at sha&#x2019;ah</italic> of this nature is crucial. Needless to say, such power is not vested in a Noahide court or in administrative officials of a secular government. But Rabbi Kook broadens his thesis in a highly innovative maneuver in arguing that, in such extreme circumstances, an actual <italic>hora&#x2019;at sha&#x2019;ah</italic> is unnecessary. He argues that, in effect, there exists a &#x201C;constructive&#x201D; <italic>hora&#x2019;at sha&#x2019;ah</italic> sanctioning such practice. Were a duly qualified Sanhedrin in existence it would most certainly grant permission to take necessary action in such egregious circumstances; therefore, actual license is unnecessary.</p>
<p>The notion of <italic>hora&#x2019;at sha&#x2019;ah</italic> is similar to the doctrine of necessity in that it is an <italic>ad hoc</italic> acceptance of a lesser evil over a greater evil not incorporated in any statutory code. Necessity, however, is always an affirmative defense and can never be the subject of prior judicial license. In contradistinction, if Rabbi Kook&#x2019;s responsum is regarded as normative, guidance in determining what is encompassed in such a <italic>hora&#x2019;at sha&#x2019;ah</italic> is available before the fact to any student or reader pondering the options available to him. But, then, that is also the case with regard to any legal scholar who peruses the literature devoted to explication of the doctrine of necessity. In both cases such an investigation is directed only to an assessment of what, after the fact, a jury would accept as necessity or what a <italic>bet din</italic> would regard as a legitimately construed <italic>hora&#x2019;at sha&#x2019;ah</italic>.</p>
<h1>VI. <italic>An Afterword</italic></h1>
<p>In a certain sense the conclusions of this endeavor are counterintuitive. They certainly go against the grain of a sensitive contemporary moral conscience. We correctly abhor infliction of pain upon others; we correctly abhor anything akin to depriving a person of human dignity. We disdain depriving people of autonomy; we certainly condemn dehumanization of human beings. Yet, for Judaism, morality and ethics are not subjective. Morality is the product of the halakhic system which itself is the embodiment of divine revelation.<sup><xref rid="fn37">37</xref></sup> Jewish law is the embodiment of a corpus of moral principles, not all of which are self-evident to the human mind.</p>
<p>The Roman law maxim is &#x201C;Let justice be done even if the world is destroyed.&#x201D; The rabbinic maxim is &#x201C;Let the law pierce the mountain.&#x201D; Let the law be enforced even if in the process it is necessary to bore through mountains; let justice be done even if the obstacles are deeply rooted human sensibilities. In the context of this discussion the appropriate maxim may well be &#x201C;Let justice be done even if it must pierce the mountain of the human psyche.&#x201D;</p>

<ftnote id="fn3">3. In addition to establishing a two-witness rule as the standard of proof for conviction, Jewish law requires that the culprit 1) be warned in advance that his transgression carries with it capital punishment, 2) that the witnesses not contradict one another even with regard to ancillary matters, 3) that the witnesses observe the act simultaneously and, finally, 4) that they be aware of each other&#x2019;s presence. In cases of homicide, and homicide only, there is a punishment available other than the biblically prescribed form of execution. The punishment consists of placing the convicted criminal in a cell (<italic>kippah</italic>), providing him with reduced rations of bread and water in order to shrink the digestive system and then feeding him barley in order to cause fatal distention. According to Rambam, that punishment was administered if any one of the first three conditions enumerated above was not fulfilled; according to Rashi, it was administered if either of the first two or the fourth condition was not fulfilled. That punishment was not available in cases in which only a single witness observed the act and certainly not in cases in which the only evidence was circumstantial in nature. See Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 4:8-9 and <italic>Kesef Mishneh</italic>, <italic>ad locum</italic>. In an otherwise thoroughly cogent discussion, Alan Dershowitz, <italic>Why Terrorism Works</italic> (New Haven, 2002), p. 157, correctly identifies the problem created by establishment of a two-witness rule but is simply in error in his explanation of how Jewish law remedied that problem.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5">5. British common law had no need for torture since it accepted circumstantial evidence in determining guilt. See Sir Frederick Pollack and Frederic W. Maitland, <italic>The History of English Law</italic>, 2nd edition (Cambridge, 1898), II, 659-660. Prior to abolition of the ordeals, the defendant, in England, had the option of avoiding the ordeal by accepting a trial by jury. Consequently, it was possible to apply the same standard of proof to serious crime as had been applied to petty crime during the earlier period of trial by ordeal. The jury&#x2019;s verdict was not a divine judgment and hence did not require absolute proof. Accordingly, circumstantial evidence was accepted as sufficient. With abrogation of trial by ordeal, a jury trial became the only option. See <italic>Torture and the Law of Proof</italic>, p. 275.</ftnote>
<ftnote>However, torture by order of the Privy Council or the monarch was used in at least eighty-one cases during the Tudor-Stuart period between 1540 and 1640. See James Heath, <italic>Torture and English Law: An Administrative History from the Plantagenets to the Stuarts</italic> (Westport, 1982) and Langbein, <italic>Torture</italic>, pp. 81-128. Most of those cases involved real or suspected sedition or treason. See <italic>Torture and the Law of Proof</italic>, pp. 73-74. In the words of Sir Francis Bacon: &#x201C;In the highest cases of treason, torture is used for discovery, and not for evidence.&#x201D; Hence, the coercive maneuvers employed in those cases can best be categorized as &#x201C;intimidative torture&#x201D; resorted to by a threatened monarch rather than as judicial torture.

<ftnote id="fn14">14. Curiously, ratification by the United States may prove to have been more symbolic than substantive. In the resolution ratifying the treaty the Senate declared, &#x201C;&#x2026; the United States considers itself bound by the obligation &#x2026; to prevent &#x2018;cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,&#x2019; only insofar as the term means the cruel, unusual and inhuman treatment or punishment prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.&#x201D; See Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification of the Convention against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment&#x2014;Reservations, Declarations, and Understandings, part I (1), 136 Cong. Rec. &#x00A7; 17491 (daily ed., October 27, 1990). In effect, the Senate agreed to eschew only acts already prohibited by the Constitution. More significantly, linkage of the phrase &#x201C;cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&#x201D; to conduct prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments does not establish an unchanging definition. Terms and phrases employed in the Constitution are subject to interpretation by the courts. Accordingly, the meaning of the words &#x201C;cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&#x201D; is restricted to the meaning assigned to them by United States courts in any judicial decision, including future decisions no less so than those handed down in the past. It then follows that a practice regarded as unconstitutional in the past may be ruled constitutional in the future and will not be independently banned by the Convention.</ftnote>
<ftnote>A highly significant limitation of the constitutional rights in question was formulated by the U.S. Supreme Court in <italic>Chavez</italic> v. <italic>Martinez</italic>, 538 U.S. 760 (2003). In fragmented opinions the Court apparently accepted the notion that coercive interrogation is acceptable in situations in which eliciting information in a timely fashion is a matter of necessity. Earlier, in a kidnapping case, <italic>Leon</italic> v. <italic>Wainwright</italic> 734 F.2d 770 (11th Circuit 1984), in dicta having no direct bearing on the actual decision, a federal appellate court approved the conduct of Miami police who choked a suspect &#x201C;until he revealed where [the victim] was being held.&#x201D; <italic>Id</italic>. at 770. The court unanimously categorized the conduct as that of &#x201C;a group of concerned officers acting in a reasonable manner to obtain information they needed in order to protect another individual from bodily harm or death.&#x201D; <italic>Id.</italic> at 773. See John T. Parry, &#x201C;Escalation and Necessity,&#x201D; <italic>Torture</italic>, pp. 150-152. That position, of course, may well serve to legitimate &#x201C;revelatory&#x201D; or &#x201C;preventative interrogational torture&#x201D; under United States law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn15">15. See, for example, Oren Gross, <italic>Torture</italic>, pp. 229-253.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Although couched in terms of a different legal doctrine, this is essentially the position of the Supreme Court of Israel as announced in H. C. 5100/94 <italic>Public Committee against Torture in Israel</italic> v. <italic>The State of Israel, The General Security Services and Others</italic>, 553(4) PD 817 (1999). Translated excerpts from that decision are published in <italic>Torture</italic>, pp. 165-181. In its decision the Israeli court disallowed even moderate forms of physical pressure despite claims that such methods were necessary to save lives. Nevertheless, relying upon the conclusions of the 1987 report of the Landau Commission, the Israeli Supreme Court invoked the traditional common-law defense of necessity and left open the possibility that an interrogator might avail himself of such a defense in &#x201C;a ticking-bomb&#x201D; situation. See <italic>infra</italic>, note 33 and accompanying text.</ftnote>
<ftnote>A necessity defence might well be recognized by a United States court, particularly if American ratification of the Geneva Convention is not understood as an absolute and unequivocal acceptance of a ban against torture. See <italic>supra</italic>, note 14. If, however, the Geneva Convention is accepted unequivocally and without reservation, it is difficult to understand how a necessity defence might be entertained. The essence of a necessity defence is that the law is not designed for, and should not be applied to, situations in which its enforcement would create a greater harm than it seeks to eliminate. The defence requires that &#x201C;the harm or evil sought to be avoided by such conduct [be] greater than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense charged.&#x201D; See Model Penal Code &#x00A7;3.02(1)(a). Accordingly, the defence would not seem to be available in a situation in which the law is expressly applicable to the circumstances giving rise to the claim of justification.</ftnote>

Isaac Arieli, <italic>Einayim la-Mishpat</italic>, <italic>Berakhot</italic> 58a, who similarly rules that the infant may be killed in order to eliminate the threat to the others in hiding.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn19">19. See R. Moshe Feinstein, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, II, no. 60, <italic>anaf</italic> 2. See also R. Shalom Dov Wolpo, <italic>Rodef u-Ba be-Ma&#x1E25;teret</italic> (Kiryat Gat, 5748), no. 25. Rabbi Wolpo&#x2019;s contention that the crying infant should not be considered a pursuer because &#x201C;such is the nature of the world&#x201D; (<italic>kakh darko shel olam</italic>) is unwarranted. The phrase occurs in Rambam&#x2019;s <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 9:6 with regard to a woman in childbirth whose life is threatened by the emerging fetus. The fetus is a pursuer and may be dismembered in order to preserve the life of the mother. However, once the head of the fetus has emerged and entered the birth canal that rule no longer applies since one life cannot be sacrificed to save another. The Gemara, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 72b, explains the distinction by declaring that in the latter case &#x201C;Heaven is pursuing her.&#x201D; Rambam rephrases that notion and interprets it as meaning &#x201C;such is the nature of the world.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote>The limitation placed by the Gemara upon the definition of a pursuer excludes only situations in which the pursuit is entirely at the hands of Heaven and any human involved is merely a passive instrument of providence. That is evident from the fact that a minor is considered to be bereft of <italic>da&#x2019;at</italic> or rational capacity. Nevertheless, the law of the pursuer applies to a minor or a person who goes berserk and wields a gun or an infant that cries. Morover, Rabbi Wolpo&#x2019;s conclusion is certainly precluded if R. Moshe Feinstein&#x2019;s analysis of Rambam&#x2019;s statement as presented in his earlier-cited responsum is accepted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn20">20. The controversy recorded in the Palestinian Talmud persists in the writing of medieval codifiers. Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah</italic> 5:5, rules that a designated victim may be delivered for execution in order to save the entire company only if he is culpable of the death penalty while Rabbenu Nissim, <italic>Yoma</italic> 82b, rules that designation alone is sufficient. Both views are cited by Rema, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 157:1, without a definitive resolution.</ftnote>
<ftnote>The controversy, however, is limited to situations in which the danger stems from the mere presence and existence of the &#x201C;pursuer.&#x201D; Moreover, unlike other instances involving a pursuer, the Palestinian Talmud indicates that delivery of the designated victim is not consistent with &#x201C;<italic>mishnat &#x1E25;asidim</italic>&#x2014;the teaching of the pious&#x201D; and that Elijah declined to continue to reveal himself to a person who had violated &#x201C;the teaching of the pious&#x201D; by acting in that manner. Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah</italic> 5:5, qualifies the import of that categorization by ruling that, although the law permits such acts, &#x201C;<italic>ein morin ken le-khat&#x1E25;ilah</italic>&#x2014;one does not direct [action] in accordance with such [rule] <italic>ex ante</italic>.&#x201D; [Cf., however, R. Jacob Emden, <italic>Even Bo&#x1E25;en</italic> 1:73, who takes issue with Rambam&#x2019;s ruling and asserts that the rule is normative in nature and should be relied upon as such. The incident involving Elijah and the concept of <italic>mishnat &#x1E25;asidim</italic>, asserts <italic>Even Bo&#x1E25;en</italic>, is limited to an <italic>adam &#x1E25;ashuv</italic>, or prominent personage such as Resh Lakish who should not involve himself even in such circumstances.] That rule stands in stark contradistinction to the rule with regard to a pursuer codifed by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 1:9, 14 and 16, mandating elimination of a pursuer.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Rabbi Wolpo correctly states the principle &#x201C;<italic>ein morin ken</italic>&#x201D; applies only to a purely passive individual whose &#x201C;pursuit&#x201D; arises simply from his existence. However, Rabbi Efrati opines that the principle applies to every pursuer who is an <italic>ones</italic>, i.e., who acts under duress. Accordingly, Rabbi Efrati regards refusal to suffocate an infant in a situation of the nature described earlier as entirely commendable. That position, however, is untenable. The Gemara, <italic>Yevamot</italic> 33b and 61b, in the phrase &#x201C;<italic>pitui ketanah ones hu</italic>,&#x201D; equates the freely-willed, autonomous act of a minor with an act committed under duress. Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 1:9, rules unequivocally that, not only a minor, but also a fetus must be killed when engaged in an act of pursuit. Indeed, it is in the context of a ruling with regard to a fetal pursuer that Rambam records the mandatory nature of the obligation to sacrifice the pursuer in order to preserve the victim.</ftnote>
<ftnote>[A possible contradiction to the principle of <italic>pitui ketanah ones hu</italic> in the discussion of the Gemara, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 55b, is dismissed by R. Elijah of Vilna, <italic>Eliyahu Rabbah</italic>, <italic>Niddah</italic> 5:5, and rendered compatible with that principle by R. Elchanan Wasserman, <italic>Kove&#x1E93; He&#x2019;arot</italic>, no. 75, sec. 2. Rambam&#x2019;s disputed ruling, <italic>Hilkhot Issurei Bi&#x2019;ah</italic> 3:2 and <italic>Hilkhot Sotah</italic> 2:4, to the effect that a minor who commits adultery is forbidden to her husband is based upon an entirely extraneous consideration. See R. Meir Simchah ha-Kohen of Dvinsk, <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;, Hilkhot Issurei Bi&#x2019;ah</italic> 3:2, s.v. <italic>ulam</italic>.]</ftnote>
<ftnote>The distinction between the case of an overt pursuer in which intervention is mandated and the situation of an entirely passive pursuer in which intervention, although permitted, is not &#x201C;the teaching of the pious&#x201D; must lie in the fact that acts of violence or endangerment must be thwarted whereas in the case of a passive pursuer there is no potentially threatening act to prevent; hence, in the latter case, prevention of harm to the threatened innocent victim represents only fulfillment of a duty of rescue. In usual situations the life of one person may not be sacrificed in order to rescue another since &#x201C;What makes you think (<italic>ma&#x2019;i &#x1E25;azit</italic>) that one life is of greater value than another.&#x201D; That consideration is negated when the life to be sacrificed is that of even a passive pursuer. The element of &#x201C;pursuit&#x201D; serves to compromise the value of the life of the pursuer. The net result is that the putative intervener may choose which life to preserve; he may choose to preserve the life of the victim by intervening or he may preserve the life of the passive pursuer by refusing to act. The &#x201C;teaching of the pious&#x201D; is that one not actively prefer one life over another when intervention is a matter of discretion.</ftnote>

Bentham sanctions torture in situations in which &#x201C;the thing which a Man is required to do&#x201D; is &#x201C;a thing which the public has an interest in his doing&#x201D; and it is either certain that it is in his power to comply or in which</ftnote>

<ftnote>Bentham concludes that portion of his discussion with the observation: &#x201C;Are there in practice any cases that can be ranked under this head? If there be any, it is plain there can be but very few.&#x201D; <italic>Ibid</italic>., pp. 312-313.</ftnote>

<title><italic>Chapter 2</italic> Sacrificing the Few to Save the Many</title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x2026; for one life is not set aside for another</italic></p>
<p align="blockquote"><small>OHOLOT</small> 7:6</p>
<p>The date 9/11 is indelibly imprinted upon the national consciousness of America. The horrific loss of life in the terrorist attacks upon the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center was an unforgettable tragedy; the attack upon the Pentagon, the nerve-center of military security, exposed the vulnerability of the nation&#x2019;s defense apparatus. But it was the fourth, thwarted, attack that is remembered for the heroism of the victims.</p>
<p>A domestic passenger flight flying from Newark International Airport to San Francisco, United Airlines Flight 93, was hijacked by terrorists some forty-five minutes into the flight. The hijackers breached the cockpit, overpowered the pilots and, taking control of the aircraft, directed it towards Washington, D.C. The hijackers&#x2019; intended target is thought to have been the White House or possibly the Capitol.</p>
<p>The terrorists&#x2019; master plan apparently called for carrying out that attack simultaneously with the attacks upon the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. However, due to airport congestion, the airplane was delayed on the ground more than half an hour. During the course of the hijacking, flight attendants and passengers, using GTE airphones and cell phones, succeeded in making numerous calls to family and friends as a result of which they learned of the other terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The passengers, apparently on the basis of a vote, determined to seize the controls of the plane from the hijackers. Of the ensuing events little is known with certainty. Early reports conjectured that the passengers were successful in overtaking the plane and that they knowingly caused the plane to crash in order to prevent greater loss of life. Strikingly, the mother of one of the passengers, herself a United Airlines flight attendant, left a message on her son&#x2019;s cell phone urging an attempt to take over the aircraft. Much later, a report issued by a government investigating commission gave no indication that the passengers broke through the cockpit door but made it clear that the passengers&#x2019; actions thwarted the plans of the terrorists. Recordings of cockpit conversations reveal that the terrorists feared that they would imminently lose control and debated whether to crash the plane immediately or whether to delay such action. The passengers&#x2019; death certificates state the cause of death as homicide and those of the hijackers list suicide as the cause of death. It is unclear whether the hijackers ultimately did crash the plane deliberately or whether they simply lost control. Had the passengers been successful in gaining control of the plane, the ending might well have been much happier. Among the passengers was an aviation executive who had extensive experience in a cockpit as a private pilot. Another passenger was experienced as an air traffic controller with the Air National Guard. Given those facts, there is scant reason to question the halakhic propriety of the course of action taken by the passengers.</p>
<p>Far more complex is the issue of purposely shooting down the plane and thereby causing the death of innocent passengers.<sup><xref rid="fn38">1</xref></sup> Air Force and Air National Guard fighter jets were unable to intercept the planes headed to the World Trade Center and the Pentagon but indications are that they would have reached the fourth plane in time to prevent it from reaching Washington. The option of shooting down the commercial jet was certainly given serious consideration and a decision to do so may actually have been reached.</p>
<p>The propriety of purposely causing the immediate death of the passengers aboard the plane in order to prevent further loss of life hinges upon the applicability of a provision of Halakhah recorded by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah</italic> 5:5:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2026;if the heathen said to them, &#x2018;Give us one of your company and we shall kill him; if not we will kill all of you,&#x2019; let them all be killed but let them not deliver to them [the heathens] a single Jewish soul. But if they specified [the victim] to them and said, &#x2018;Give us so and so or we shall kill all of you,&#x2019; if he had incurred the death penalty as Sheba the son of Bichri, they may deliver him to them&#x2026; but if he has not incurred the death penalty let them all be killed but let them not deliver a single Jewish soul.</p>
<p>Rambam&#x2019;s ruling is based upon the explication of the narrative of II Samuel 20:4-22 found in the Palestinian Talmud, <italic>Terumot</italic> 8:12. Joab, commander of King David&#x2019;s troops, had pursued Sheba the son of Bichri and besieged the town of Abel in which Sheba sought refuge. Thereupon Joab demanded that Sheba be delivered to the king&#x2019;s forces; otherwise, Joab threatened to destroy the entire city. On the basis of the verse, &#x201C;Sheba the son of Bichri has lifted up his hand against the king, against David&#x201D; (II Samuel 20:21), Resh Lakish infers that acquiescence with a demand of such nature can be sanctioned only in instances in which the victim&#x2019;s life is lawfully forfeit, as was the case with regard to Sheba the son of Bichri who is described as being guilty of <italic>l&#x00E8;se majest&#x00E9;</italic>. However, in instances in which the designated victim is guiltless, all must suffer death rather than become accomplices to murder. R. Yo&#x1E25;anan maintains that the question of guilt is irrelevant; rather, the crucial factor is the singling out of a specific individual by the oppressor. Members of a group have no right to select one of their number and deliver him to death in order to save their own lives. Since the life of each individual is of inestimable value there is no basis for preferring one life over another. However, once a specific person has been marked for death in any event, either alone if surrendered by his companions or together with the entire group if they refuse to comply, those who deliver him are not to be regarded as accessories. Rambam&#x2019;s ruling is in accordance with the opinion of Resh Lakish. Both opinions are cited by Rema, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 157:1.<sup><xref rid="fn39">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sheba ben Bichri was doomed to die in any event. Since Sheba would perish together with the other inhabitants of the besieged city, refusal to deliver him to the hands of the enemy would have served to spare his life for only a brief period. It is evident that the discussion in the Palestinian Talmud is predicated upon the premise that it is forbidden to cause the loss of even <italic>&#x1E25;ayyei sha&#x2019;ah</italic>, i.e., a brief or limited period of longevity anticipation, of a particular individual in order to preserve the normal longevity anticipation of a multitude of individuals.</p>
<p><italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, <italic>Gilyonot le-&#x1E24;iddushei Rabbenu &#x1E24;ayyim ha-Levi</italic>, <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah</italic> 5:1, s.v. <italic>u-mi-kol makom</italic>, demonstrates the same principle on the basis of his analysis of the well-known controversy between R. Akiva and Ben Petura recorded by the Gemara, <italic>Bava Me&#x1E93;i&#x2019;a</italic> 62a. The case involves two people who are stranded in a desert with but a single container of water. There is sufficient water to sustain one person until he reaches safety; however, if the water is shared, neither will survive. Ben Petura declares that they should share the water and &#x201C;let not one witness the death of his fellow.&#x201D; R. Akiva rules that the owner of the water should drink it himself in order to save his own life. In support of that ruling R. Akiva cites the verse, &#x201C;that your brother may live with you&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:36). That biblical command requires that a person enable his brother to live with him but not that he prefer his brother over himself. If so, the life of another person should not be preferred over one&#x2019;s own life with the result, as announced by R. Akiva, that &#x201C;your life takes precedence.&#x201D;</p>
<p><italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, as were others before him, was troubled by the fact that Ben Petura&#x2019;s conflicting ruling is apparently refuted by R. Akiva&#x2019;s quite cogent inference drawn from the verse &#x201C;that your brother may live with you&#x201D; &#x2013; but not at the expense of your life.<sup><xref rid="fn40">3</xref></sup> Accordingly, <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> asserts that Ben Petura is actually in agreement with the basic principle enunciated by R. Akiva with the result that, in a situation in which only one person can receive any longevity benefit, one&#x2019;s own life takes precedence over that of another. Thus, for example, if two individuals have been poisoned and one of the two is in possession of a sufficient quantity of an antidote to save one person but, if divided, the quantity available will prolong the life of neither, Ben Petura would agree that the owner of the antidote must administer it to himself. Ben Petura would also concede that, if the antidote belongs to a third party, the halakhic rules of triage would apply. Ben Petura, asserts <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, disagrees only in the case of the container of water because, if the water is shared, the life of each of the stranded persons will be prolonged at least minimally, whereas administering less than the requisite dose of the antidote would be entirely without purpose. Ben Petura, in disagreeing with R. Akiva, does so because he recognizes a duty of rescue with regard to even <italic>&#x1E25;ayyei sha&#x2019;ah</italic>. Since sharing the water serves to prolong the life of both at least minimally, such sharing is an act of loving one&#x2019;s fellow as oneself, i.e., both lives are rendered equal. Put in somewhat different terms, since every moment of life is of infinite value and all infinities are equal, the fact that if one person drinks the entire quantity of water he will survive and enjoy a normal life-span is of no consequence. R. Akiva disagrees in maintaining that loving one&#x2019;s fellow as oneself, but not more than oneself, requires preservation of one&#x2019;s own normal longevity anticipation even if such rescue precludes prolongation of the <italic>&#x1E25;ayyei sha&#x2019;ah</italic> of another.</p>
<p>Consequently, argues <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, even according to R. Akiva, it is only self-preservation that can excuse ignoring the <italic>&#x1E25;ayyei sha&#x2019;ah</italic> of another. It would then follow that, if the container of water belongs to a third party who is not in danger of perishing as a result of dehydration, that person, even according to R. Akiva, must divide the water equally between the two persons at risk. The principle that emerges is that a person dare not ignore the <italic>&#x1E25;ayyei sha&#x2019;ah</italic> of one putative victim even to carry out the complete rescue of another victim or even of many such victims.<sup><xref rid="fn41">4</xref></sup> <italic>A fortiori</italic>, an overt act having the effect of extinguishing even an ephemeral period of life-anticipation of even a single individual cannot be countenanced in order to save the lives of many.</p>
<p>The only situation in which the life of another individual may be sacrificed in order to rescue a putative victim is in the case of a <italic>rodef</italic>, or pursuer. In such cases, as codified by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 1:9, intervention in order to preserve the life of the victim is mandatory. In the case under discussion, the airplane pilot certainly must be categorized as a <italic>rodef</italic> even though he acts under duress. However, the passengers inside the airplane are in no way complicit in the potential death of the innocent people in the building targeted for destruction. Although the life of the <italic>rodef</italic> is forfeit, provided that taking the life of the <italic>rodef</italic> is necessary in order to rescue the victim, it is not permissible to cause collateral damage in the nature of the death of an innocent third party in eliminating the threat posed by the <italic>rodef</italic>. The pilot, who is intent upon using the airplane to bring death upon innocent victims, may be prevented from doing so even if it is necessary to kill him in order to accomplish that end<sup><xref rid="fn42">5</xref></sup> but it is not permissible to cause the death of innocent passengers who are no more than passive bystanders even for the purpose of preserving the lives of a greater number of people.<sup><xref rid="fn43">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some time ago, Philippa Foot presented a moral dilemma in formulating the &#x201C;Trolley Problem.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn44">7</xref></sup> The situation involved the driver of a trolley rounding a bend. Five track workmen are seen to be engaged in repairing the track. The track is surrounded on two sides by a steep mountain and the trolley is travelling much faster than the workmen could possibly run. The driver steps on the brake in order to avoid striking the five men. Tragically, the brakes fail. The driver sees a spur of track in front of him leading off to one side. The driver can quite easily steer the trolley so that it will travel down that spur and thus save the lives of the five men on the track straight ahead. Unfortunately, there is a single workman who is repairing that spur. The workman cannot possibly get off the track before the trolley hits him. If the driver does nothing, five men will perish. If he turns the trolley onto the spur only one person will die but that person is at this moment in no danger whatsoever. Is it morally permissible to turn the trolley so that it claims the life of a single person in order to rescue five individuals?<sup><xref rid="fn45">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>A situation quite similar to that of the runaway trolley is described by <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, no. 25, s.v. <italic>ve-zeh le-ayyein</italic>. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> describes a situation in which a bystander witnesses the release of an arrow aimed at a large group of people. The bystander has the ability to rescue the intended victims by deflecting the arrow; however, if he does so, the arrow will claim a single victim who heretofore was endangered in no way whatsoever. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> expresses doubt with regard to the permissibility of such intervention. If the hypothetical is changed from an arrow to a hand grenade, the moral dilemma acquires contemporary relevance.</p>
<p><italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>&#x2019;s perplexity seems to be based upon the possibility of considering the situation to be analogous to triage. A person who comes upon multiple accident victims must perforce choose which of the many victims he will attend. Triage for the purpose of rescue is quite different from selection for death. A person does not have license to designate another individual for death even if his motive is the rescue of a far larger number of lives. However, if the same person can save one, but not all, of the victims, he is required to intervene. In doing so, he is in no way complicit in the death of others. His selection is for rescue rather than for death; acts of rescue are profoundly different from acts of homicide. A person capable of doing so may, and indeed must, save as many lives as possible even if such rescue entails abandoning one or more victims to their fate.</p>
<p>To be sure, in the case of the runaway trolley, the flying arrow, or the hand grenade, the original act to which the ultimate death of the victims is to be attributed was already completed before the moral agent confronts a choice between intervening for the purpose of deflecting a lethal weapon and passive non-intervention. The motive for intervention is certainly the rescue of those who will be saved, not the death of the person who will actually die in their stead. It is, however, difficult to understand how intervention in the form of deflecting a lethal weapon can be regarded as a simple act of rescue governed by principles of triage. In the given hypothetical, it is the act of deflection that endangers a previously unendangered person. The intervener has not simply rescued a larger group of victims; he has in an active, overt manner caused the death of an innocent person. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> himself emphasizes that even R. Yo&#x1E25;anan, who maintains that in the event that the victim has already been designated for execution he may be delivered to the enemy, would agree that one may not actually kill the designated victim in order to spare other victims. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> argues that R. Yo&#x1E25;anan permits only indirectly hastening the death of a designated victim by delivering him to the enemy but does not sanction a direct act of homicide.<sup><xref rid="fn46">9</xref></sup> It seems to this writer that deflection of a lethal weapon constitutes a direct rather than an indirect act. That objection has been raised by R. Benjamin Rabinowitz-Te&#x2019;umim, <italic>No&#x2019;am</italic>, VII (5724), 357.<sup><xref rid="fn47">10</xref></sup> R. Eli&#x2019;ezer Waldenberg, <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic>, XV, no. 70, addresses <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>&#x2019;s hypothetical and concludes that passive non-intervention is the only acceptable mode of conduct.</p>
<p>Putting that point aside, any argument in support of deflecting the arrow must be based on the premise that a distinction can be drawn between intervention for purposes of neutralizing a direct danger and overt delivery to death in order to ward off future deaths.</p>
<p>There are authorities who, in certain limited cases, permit sacrificing one life to save another when failure to intervene would result in the death of both persons. The question of killing a neonate whose forehead has emerged from the birth canal in order to save the life of the mother when, otherwise, the lives of both would be forfeit is raised by R. Akiva Eger, <italic>Tosafot R. Akiva Eger</italic>, <italic>Oholot</italic> 7:6, no. 16, but left unresolved. R. Akiva Eger does however cite <italic>Teshuvot Panim Me&#x2019;irot</italic>, III, no. 8, who rules that such a course of action is permissible. R. Israel Lipschutz, <italic>Tiferet Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, <italic>Oholot</italic> 7:6, <italic>Bo&#x2019;az</italic>, sec. 10, similarly comments that, &#x201C;perhaps it is permissible to destroy the infant in such circumstances in order to rescue the mother.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn48">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Saul Mordecai Arieli, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, vol. 8, no. 3 (Adar Sheni 5763), compares the case of the airplane seized by terrorists planning to crash it into the Pentagon to the situation of the mother in childbirth in arguing that it is permissible to cause the death of innocent passengers by shooting down the plane since the latter are doomed in any event. Nevertheless, it is virtually self-evident that such a comparison is inapt. If correct, that reasoning should apply as well to the situation described in the Palestinian Talmud in which one person has already been designated for death and failure to deliver him to the enemy will result in the death of all. R. Yo&#x1E25;anan and Resh Lakish disagree with regard to whether it is permissible to become even indirectly complicit in the death of the doomed victim by delivering him for execution but all agree that he may not actively be put to death in order to spare the lives of others.<sup><xref rid="fn49">12</xref></sup> The case of the woman in childbirth is quite different because both mother and child are reciprocal pursuers, i.e., each is in the process of causing the death of the other. Non-intervention is mandated as explained by the Babylonian Talmud, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 72b, because &#x201C;heaven is pursuing her&#x201D; or, in the words of the Palestinian Talmud, because &#x201C;you do not know who is pursuing whom.&#x201D; The rationale for non-intervention is either that a natural physiological process is an &#x201C;act of God,&#x201D; and hence the person who is the instrument of danger cannot be categorized as a pursuer, or that intervention in cases of pursuit is warranted only in order to preserve the life of the victim but in a case of mutual pursuit each party is both victim and aggressor and, consequently, the rule is non-intervention.</p>
<p>The authorities who permit intervention in childbirth do so only because they regard the exception to the law of the pursuer formulated by the Gemara to be limited to activities of mutual aggression in which, barring intervention, one will prevail while the other will perish but the bystander is in no position to determine which of the two will live and which will die. In such situations the bystander may not choose between the two on the basis of the law of pursuit. However, they contend, if in the absence of intervention, both will die, each of the two must be regarded with certainty as being a <italic>rodef</italic>. Accordingly, those authorities regard intervention in order to rescue one of the parties to be permissible since, fundamentally, intervention is for the purpose of eliminating a <italic>rodef</italic> whose life is forfeit. Consequently, they regard intervention as a permissible act of rescue rather than as an act of selection for death. However, it is quite evident that this line of reasoning is not applicable in the case of innocent airplane passengers who are not at all engaged in pursuit. There are no grounds actively to cause the death of passengers in order to save others despite the fact that they, too, are doomed.</p>
<p>Me&#x2019;iri, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 72b, expresses the novel view that, in the case of a woman in &#x201C;hard travail,&#x201D; although a third party is barred from destroying the infant in order to save the mother because of inapplicability of the law of pursuit, nevertheless the mother herself may exercise the right of self-defense to save her own life. A similar view is held by R. Joseph Saul Nathanson, <italic>Teshuvot Sho&#x2019;el u-Meshiv</italic>, I, no. 22.<sup><xref rid="fn50">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nor is the situation comparable to that described by the Gemara, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 26b, in which a child is thrown from a roof but, before landing and perishing from the fall, he is stabbed to death by another person. The majority view is that neither party incurs capital punishment. As explained by the medieval commentaries, the first performed a lethal act but did not actually kill. The second administered a <italic>coup de grace</italic>, but only after a lethal act had already been initiated and thus his act is comparable to extinguishing the life of a <italic>treifah</italic>. Causing the death of a <italic>treifah</italic> is an act of non-capital homicide because the cause of death has already been set in motion and capital punishment is administered only if the perpetrator has extinguished <italic>kol nefesh</italic>, i.e., &#x201C;an entire life.&#x201D; The airplane passengers cannot be considered as being in that category because no lethal act that would result in the loss of their lives has actually been initiated.<sup><xref rid="fn51">14</xref></sup> Moreover, in terms of normative Halakhah, a <italic>treifah</italic> may not be killed to preserve the life of another individual.<sup><xref rid="fn52">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rescue of human life is a divine mandate, but that imperative does not constitute license to commit an overt act of homicide. At times, passive non-intervention is the only morally acceptable option.</p>
<ftnote id="fn38">1. Voluntary self-sacrifice in order to rescue the community of Israel is sanctioned by <italic>Yeshu&#x2019;ot Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 157:1, on the basis of a report of such an act recorded in <italic>Bava Batra</italic> 10b and the approbation lavished upon those individuals. Cf., however, R. Abraham I. Kook, <italic>Mishpat Kohen</italic>, no. 143, who states that the incident described in <italic>Bava Batra</italic> demonstrates only that persons who would themselves perish together with the community may act in that manner. Nevertheless, <italic>Mishpat Kohen</italic>, nos. 143-144, presents another argument in sanctioning martyrdom for the purpose of rescuing the community of Israel. See also R. Meir Don Plocki, <italic>&#x1E24;emdat Yisra&#x2019;el, Parashat Pin&#x1E25;as</italic>, sec. 1. Cf., however, R. Meir Simchah ha-Kohen of Dvinsk, <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;, Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 7:8 and <italic>idem</italic>, <italic>Meshekh &#x1E24;okhmah, Parashat Shemot</italic>, s.v. <italic>lekh shuv mi&#x1E93;rayimah</italic>. Nevertheless, voluntary self-sacrifice is not sanctioned simply to rescue a larger number of people. Cf., <italic>Ve-Ha&#x2019;arev Na</italic>, I, 106-107.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn39">2. In the case of the hijacked airplane the passengers may be regarded as specified because, in the absence of intervention, they would all die. If intervention were sanctioned, sacrificing their lives would save others but there was no possibility of sacrificing others in order to save them. Nevertheless, even if victims are specified, R. Yo&#x1E25;anan does not sanction actively hastening death in order to save others.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn40">3. Cf., Ramban, <italic>Commentary on the Bible</italic>, Leviticus 19:18, who observes that, according to R. Akiva, &#x201C;and you shall love your neighbor as yourself&#x201D; should be understood in a similar manner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn41">4. Cf., however, <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>&#x2019;s apparently contradictory comments, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat Nezikin</italic>, <italic>Likkutim</italic>, no. 20, <italic>Bava Me&#x1E93;i&#x2019;a</italic> 62a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn42">5. The plane itself also has the status of a <italic>rodef</italic> despite the absence of any element of moral culpability because it is the weight and velocity of the plane that will cause the victims to perish. However, it is unlikely that the incremental weight of the passengers presents a danger that would otherwise not exist; hence, none of the passengers can be considered a <italic>rodef</italic>. See R. Shlomoh Zefrani, <italic>Shimru Mishpat</italic> (January 5, 5764), no. 128.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn43">6. A case of such nature arose during World War II. A German &#x201C;spy ring&#x201D; consisting of double agents supplied the German government with information concerning the areas in which V1 and V2 rockets were falling. It was proposed that the double agent transmitting information to the German military report that most of the rockets had fallen well north of London so that future rockets would be aimed a number of miles to the south. The purpose was to assure that future rockets would fall in Kent, Surrey or Sussex where there would be far fewer casualties than in London. The proposal was reportedly placed before the Cabinet by Herbert Morrison, the Home Secretary, but with the negative comment that the report would soon be known by the British populace to be untrue and &#x201C;doubts would be cast upon the accuracy of Government statements generally.&#x201D; Churchill was abroad at the time, but the Cabinet rejected the proposal on the grounds that the British government was not justified in choosing to sacrifice unendangered citizens in order to save others. See Sefton Delmer, <italic>The Counterfeit Spy</italic> (London, 1971), p. 209. Despite the Cabinet veto, the deception team continued with their efforts to trick the Germans into correcting the aim and range of the German rockets. Morrison, with furious indignation, once again brought the matter before the Cabinet. He is reported to have exclaimed, &#x201C;Who are we to act as God? Who are we to decide that one man shall die because he lives on the South Coast while another survives because he lives in London?&#x201D; Morrison&#x2019;s view ultimately prevailed. See <italic>ibid</italic>., p. 214.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn44">7. The problem was first advanced by Philippa Foot, &#x201C;The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect,&#x201D; <italic>Oxford Review</italic>, no. 5 (Oxford, 1967), pp. 5-15, reprinted in Philippa Foot, <italic>Virtues and Vices and Other Essays in Moral Philosophy</italic>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Oxford, 2002), pp. 19-32.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn45">8. Philippa Foot&#x2019;s example is somewhat complicated by the fact that, if the five were already on the track before the locomotive was set in motion, it is the driver who set in motion the chain of events that will lead to loss of life. Can he &#x201C;remedy&#x201D; an act that would cost five lives by modifying the act so that it will result in the loss of a different, but single, life? The hypothetical could just as readily involve a situation in which the driver has had a seizure and it is now a passenger who must take over the controls. The difference is that the passenger has heretofore been in no way involved in the performance of an act that will lead to fatality. May he now cause the death of one person in order to save five others? That dilemma is discussed by Professor Foot in &#x201C;Killing and Letting Die,&#x201D; <italic>Abortion: Moral and Legal Perspectives</italic>, J. Garfield, ed. (Amherst, 1985), pp. 177-85, reprinted in Philippa Foot, <italic>Moral Dilemmas and Other Topics in Moral Philosophy</italic> (Oxford, 2002), pp. 78-87, seemingly without an awareness of the difference between the two hypotheticals. See <italic>Moral Dilemmas</italic>, p. 85. It is not at all clear that a distinction should be made between the two cases. If a distinction is to be made it would be on the basis of the following consideration: Although overtly causing the death of one person to save a group of individuals is forbidden because each life is of infinite value, nevertheless, if the potential intervener himself set the chain of events in motion, even unintentionally, he has a duty to minimize his own transgression. That consideration may be sufficient grounds to deflect the arrow or trolley so that he is responsible for fewer acts of homicide. A discussion of that issue is beyond the scope of this endeavor but should focus upon an analysis of <italic>Shabbat</italic> 4a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn46">9. Absent designation, even indirectly causing the death of another in order to save one&#x2019;s own life is included in the category of <italic>yehareg ve-al ya&#x2019;avor</italic>. See R. Yeruchem Yehudah Perilman, <italic>Or Gadol</italic> (Vilna, 5684), no. 1, <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah</italic> 5:2, s.v<italic>. ve-ha-nireh</italic> (p. 5a) and s.v. <italic>ve-ha-ikar</italic> (p. 10b) and <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, <italic>Gilyonot le-&#x1E24;iddushei Rabbenu &#x1E24;ayyim ha-Levi</italic>, <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah</italic> 5:1, s.v. <italic>ve-yesh lomar</italic>. Cf., however, <italic>Galya Masekhta</italic> (Vilna, 5605), <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 5, s.v<italic>. u-ke-ein he&#x2019;arah</italic> (p. 92a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn47">10. Capital culpability is an entirely different matter. The arrow, for example, reaches its goal only because of the combination of the force imparted by the archer and the channeling of that force by the intervener. The situation seems analogous to a case of an arsonist who lights a fire that is carried by the wind and causes death. In that case, it is the act of lighting a fire together with the force of wind that causes death. Capital culpability in such circumstances is dependent upon the talmudic controversy regarding <italic>isho mishum &#x1E25;i&#x1E93;av</italic> or <italic>isho mishum memmono</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn48">11. For a fuller discussion of this question see this writer&#x2019;s <italic>Contemporary Halakhic Problems</italic>, I (New York, 1977), 355-361.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn50">13. That view is dismissed by R. Moshe Yonah Zweig, <italic>No&#x2019;am</italic>, VII, 55, as &#x201C;the opinion of an individual&#x201D; having no standing in the determination of Halakhah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn51">14. Depiction of such a victim as a <italic>gavra ketila</italic>, or &#x201C;dead man,&#x201D; is equally specious. That classification is applicable to a transgressor actually under sentence of death pronounced by a <italic>bet din</italic>.

<title><italic>Chapter 3</italic> In the Wake of <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> 5769</title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name; by the greatness of His might and because He is strong in power not one is missing.</italic></p>
<p align="blockquote">ISAIAH 40:26</p>
<p>&#x201C;There is nothing new under the sun&#x201D; (Ecclesiastes 1:9). The world in which the sun began its 207<sup>th</sup> 28-year cycle is not new, but it is certainly vastly different from the world as it was at the beginning of earlier cycles within both human memory and recorded history. Heretofore, <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> was a little-noted event, marked by the otherwise observant but of only passing curiosity&#x2014;if that&#x2014;to others, and of no interest at all beyond the Jewish community. This time the event was celebrated in communities throughout the world by large assemblies of Jews and, in many locales, by throngs numbering in the thousands. Unlike former occasions, the media, including wire services, conducted interviews and published articles heralding the event.<sup><xref rid="fn53">1</xref></sup> In preparation for the last such event in 1981 more Hebrew-language publications dealing with <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> appeared than in all of prior Jewish literary history. This time, in addition to expanded and enhanced editions of many of those works, a host of compendia and monographs were published well in advance of the event. Clearly, both interest in, and observance of, Jewish ritual in general, and of <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> in particular, are far more intense than in years gone by.</p>
<p><italic>Birkat ha</italic>-<italic>&#x1E24;ammah</italic> 5769 was an event virtually without precedent. The sheer number of individuals who gathered in synagogues, plazas, public places and even beaches to recite the blessing was phenomenal. From the earliest recitation of <italic>Birkat ha</italic>-<italic>&#x1E24;ammah</italic> in New Zealand<sup><xref rid="fn54">2</xref></sup>, the event was observed over a period of close to twenty-five hours both in metropolitan centers and in far-flung communities throughout the world.</p>
<p>The tremendously enhanced interest in, and observance of, <italic>Birkat ha</italic>-<italic>&#x1E24;ammah</italic> as compared even to the last such event twenty-eight years ago may be attributed to a number of technological, scholarly and socioreligious developments:</p>
<p align="blockquote">(1) <italic>Technology</italic>. The impact of computer and internet technology was forcefully impressed upon me during the period that elapsed between the appearance of the first impression of my revised and expanded <italic>Bircas haChammah</italic> and the second impression published only a few weeks later. Following the publication of <italic>Bircas haChammah</italic> in 5741, I was pleasantly surprised by the number of written responses I received during the ensuing months and years. Readers noted typographical errors, academics wrote with queries, rabbinic scholars shared insights, and bibliophiles pointed out additional obscure sources. But I was unprepared for the avalanche of communications that followed the appearance of <italic>Bircas haChammah</italic> in 5769. This time the medium was not the postal service but the computer. The sheer volume was overwhelming and, unfortunately, time did not permit an immediate response to each interlocutor. Undoubtedly, the ease and rapidity of e-mail played a significant role in fostering such extensive interaction.</p>
<p align="blockquote">(2) <italic>Scholarship</italic>. Remarkable was not only the increased volume of communications but also the marked change in quality and content. I received a significant number of lengthy and detailed questions and comments from individuals, and several from groups of <italic>kollel</italic> scholars both in this country and in Israel, engaged in collaborative study of the topic. Both the tenor and content of those communications testify to the worldwide burgeoning of a community of serious and erudite &#x201C;<italic>lomdishe</italic>&#x201D; scholars. I was awed and impressed. <italic>Akhshar dara</italic>. <italic>Barukh she</italic>-<italic>higi&#x2019;anu la</italic>-<italic>zman ha</italic>-<italic>zeh</italic>&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">(3) <italic>Socio-religious phenomena.</italic> The phenomenally large numbers of people who participated in gatherings for recitation of <italic>Birkat ha</italic>-<italic>&#x1E24;ammah</italic> was recorded in the media and confirmed by photographic illustrations.<sup><xref rid="fn55">3</xref></sup> The media also focused upon non-traditional, deviationist and secular environmentalist groups who, seemingly, sought to turn this religiously mandated observance into a happening.<sup><xref rid="fn56">4</xref></sup> The initial reaction of many&#x2014;myself included&#x2014;was to dismiss such efforts as sheer trivialization, bandwagoning, or a public relations ploy. But that is far too simplistic. <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> may sometimes have been trivialized in those quarters but it was not entirely misunderstood. The advent of the event struck a responsive cord in so many who long both for authentic religious experience and for expression of such experience in meaningful ritual. Responsible religious leaders should recognize those responses as reflective of a deep yearning and redouble their efforts to transmute those cravings into authentic observance of Torah and <italic>mi&#x1E93;vot</italic>.</p>
<h1>I. Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah <italic>Literature: Old and New</italic></h1>
<p>The months leading to <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> 5769 saw the republication of the classic monographs authored by R.

<p>Historical material, including reports of observances of <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> and discourses delivered on those occasions over a span of centuries, as well as astronomical and calendrical information, was compiled by R. Mordecai Genot in his intriguing <italic>Birkhat ha-&#x1E24;ammah bi-Tkufata</italic> (Bnei Brak, 5769). Another volume of historical interest, <italic>Ro&#x2019;ei Shemesh</italic> (Jerusalem, 5769) is a compilation by R. Yehudah A. Horowitz of sermons delivered on the occasion of <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> by German rabbinic personalities.</p>
<p>Nor was there a dearth of articles, pamphlets and briefer discussions. A section of a volume of <italic>shi&#x2019;urim</italic> of R.

The booklet <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> published by Machon Barah ke-Chammah of Jerusalem, includes a pr&#x00E9;cis of the laws of <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> according to <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> and <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> with the approbation of R. Chaim Kanievsky and a pamphlet entitled <italic>Yir&#x2019;aukha im Shemesh</italic> published in Jerusalem by the <italic>Yated Ne&#x2019;eman</italic> includes the practices of R. Yosef Shalom Eliashiv as reported by R. Yosef Efratti. A useful pamphlet, <italic>Sefer Yir&#x2019;aukha im Shemesh</italic>, by the late R. Abraham Blumenkrantz contains astronomical information. <italic>Ha-Shemesh bi-Gevurato</italic> (Monsey, 5769) authored by R. Yosef Zalman Bloch presents a discussion of the astronomical premises postulated by the Sages. An extensive analytic discussion of the principles governing the Jewish calendar entitled &#x201C;Bircas HaChamah and Calendar Mathematics: Precision, Simplicity and Conflict,&#x201D; by Sheldon Epstein, Bernard Dickman and Yonah Wilamowsky appears in the online journal <italic>&#x1E24;akirah</italic>, <italic>the Flatbush Journal of Jewish Law and Thought</italic> (Summer, 2008), pp. 147-195.<sup><xref rid="fn57">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>English-language inspirational literature includes <italic>Tomorrow&#x2019;s Sun</italic> by R. David Goldwasser and <italic>Once in Twenty-Eight Years</italic> by R. Moshe Goldberger. Indicative of the widespread interest aroused by observance of <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> this year was a publication addressed to children by R. Shimon Grama of Lakewood, N.J. entitled <italic>Understanding Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah its Laws and Customs</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn58">6</xref></sup> A 3D presentation depicting the solar system and clarifying details regarding <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> was prepared by R. Chaim S. Friedman. A version of this production was widely disseminated by the outreach organization Oorah. A series of Yiddish-language tapes dealing with both theoretical and practical aspects of <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> was distributed by Satmar institutions in Monsey, New York.</p>
<h1>II. <italic>The Meaning of</italic> Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah<sup><xref rid="fn59">7</xref></sup></h1>
<h3>1. <italic>The Commandment to Love God</italic></h3>
<p>In the course of being interviewed by reporters, a significant number posed a single question to this writer: &#x201C;How is this ritual distinguishable from sun-worship?&#x201D; The question is age-old, yet it belies a shocking lack of understanding. As reported in the Tosefta, <italic>Berakhot</italic> 6:10, R. Judah decried recitation of <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> as &#x201C;<italic>derekh a&#x1E25;eret</italic>,&#x201D; i.e., a form of idolatry. Centuries later, R. Chaim Joseph David Azulai, known as the <italic>&#x1E24;ida</italic>, <italic>Moreh be-E&#x1E93;ba</italic>, no. 6, sec. 190, as well as a number of subsequent authorities admonished either that <italic>aleinu</italic> not be recited or that care be taken to turn away from the sun lest the onlooker construe bowing in the course of the prayer as an act of obeisance to the sun.</p>
<p>Most certainly, <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> is not an act of sun-worship. But in the words of the simple son (no pun intended) voiced in the course of the Passover <italic>seder</italic> which in 5769 occurred on the evening following <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic>: &#x201C;<italic>Mah zot</italic>&#x2014;What is this?&#x201D; What is its import and why is there so much fanfare?</p>
<p>In its essence, <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> is a very simple blessing. In addition to the initial phrase, &#x201C;Blessed are You, O Lord, our God, King of the universe,&#x201D; the crucial formula that is the <italic>sine qua non</italic> of every <italic>berakhah</italic>, <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> consists of exactly three additional words: &#x201C;<italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic>&#x2014;who makes the work of creation.&#x201D; That blessing, recited in a variety of different contexts, acknowledges God as the author of various extraordinary natural phenomena representing, as they do, divine creation of the universe in its entirety. In the case of <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic>, it is a solar event that occasions the blessing.</p>
<p>Judaism exhibits a fascination bordering on a fixation with regard to matters of astronomy, astrology, and celestial phenomena. The vagaries of the Jewish calendar are only the tip of the iceberg. The prophet Isaiah exclaims, &#x201C;Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name; by the greatness of His might and because He is strong in power, not one is missing&#x201D; (Isaiah 40:26). The prophet marvels at the celestial creations, at the myriad bodies that were created in the heavens, each one having an assigned task and an assigned place. Isaiah notes that their Creator knows each and every one &#x201C;by name,&#x201D; i.e., by role and function, and pointing to that phenomenon, he constructs a cryptic, but succinct and compelling, proof for the existence of the Deity. Isaiah points to the continued existence of the celestial bodies in formulating an Argument from Design. The argument is predicated upon an awareness that the ongoing existence of the universe is directly contingent upon the size, position and velocity&#x2014;not to speak of the centrifugal force&#x2014;of each of the heavenly bodies. Had any one of those bodies been created possessing different mass or shape, or located in an alternate position within the firmament, or were the laws of nature not operative, the universe would long since have ceased to exist.</p>
<p>R. Isaac Abarbanel encapsulates this insight in a brief but insightful comment on the verse that declares, &#x201C;God beheld the universe and it was good&#x201D; (Genesis 1:18). If one may be so bold as to employ anthropomorphic language in paraphrasing Abarbanel: God looked at His handiwork and exclaimed &#x201C;Eureka&#x0021; It works&#x0021;&#x201D; Everything in creation fits together like the pieces of a cosmic jigsaw puzzle. If those components did not fit together precisely in the way they do, there would not be a universe. Thus, Judaism&#x2019;s fixation upon celestial matters, as I called it, is actually a fixation upon God as the <italic>bore olam</italic>&#x2014;as the Creator of the universe.</p>
<p>Evidence of creation can be found simply by gazing at the heavens. &#x201C;Lift up your eyes on high and see,&#x201D; declares the prophet. That verse is not a declarative proposition; it is not a statement of fact. &#x201C;Lift up your eyes&#x201D; is an imperative; it is a command. The prophet is exhorting each and every one of us to look up at the sky; to ponder what we see; to ask &#x201C;who created these;&#x201D; to reflect upon their origin and nature; and bids us to recognize the greatness and majesty of God manifest in those phenomena.</p>
<p>The Sages expanded upon this relatively simple motif. The Gemara, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 75a, declares, &#x201C;Any person who is capable of calculating the equinoxes and the solstices, to plot and chart the movement of the celestial bodies comprising the zodiac but fails to engage in such calculations, of him the verse says, &#x2018;but the work of the Lord they do not regard and the work of His hands they do not see&#x2019; (Isaiah 5:12).&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn60">8</xref></sup> A person who is conversant with the fundamentals of astronomy but who fails to explore the ordered nature of the universe is remiss. This verse, as interpreted by the Sages, censures him for not engaging in that enterprise. What is it that the Sages are underscoring in this dictum? What halakhic obligation has this individual failed to fulfill?</p>
<p>The underlying notion is codified by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah</italic> 2:2, in a totally different context. In defining the thrust of the commandment &#x201C;And you shall love the Lord your God&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:5), Rambam, at least by implication, informs us that the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> does not command an emotion. It is exceedingly, and probably impossibly, difficult to command emotions directly. S<italic>efer &#x1E24;aredim</italic> had a similar difficulty explaining the cogency of commanding love of a fellow human being. Accordingly, <italic>Sefer &#x1E24;aredim</italic> 1:28-29, defines the commandment requiring one to love his fellow as well as the commandment to love the proselyte as commandments requiring concrete physical acts. Rambam, <italic>Sefer ha-Mi&#x1E93;vot</italic>, <italic>mi&#x1E93;vot aseh</italic>, no. 3, as well as <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah</italic> 2:2, defines the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> &#x201C;And you shall love the Lord your God,&#x201D; in intellectual, rather than emotional, terms.<sup><xref rid="fn61">9</xref></sup> A person fulfills the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> by intellectually recognizing the majesty of the Deity and the grandeur of His creation. Moreover, as elucidated by R. Ovadiah ben David, author of the unidentified commentary published together with that section of the <italic>Mishneh Torah</italic>, love is directly commensurate with knowledge: the greater the intellectual apprehension, the greater the love. <italic>Ahavah</italic> and <italic>yedi&#x2019;ah</italic>, love and knowledge, become conflated into a single concept. As Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Teshuvah</italic> 10:6, declares:</p>
<p align="blockquote">One loves the Holy One, blessed be He, only through the knowledge with which one knows Him. According to the knowledge is the love, if little, little and if great, great.</p>
<p>Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Teshuvah</italic> 10:3, followed by <italic>Sefer &#x1E24;aredim</italic> 1:5, declares that such intellectual awareness generates an emotional state akin to lovesickness as described by King Solomon, Song of Songs 2:5. How does one come to know, and hence love, God? By apprehending His glory, grandeur and majesty. And how does one achieve such an awareness? By investigating the nature of the created universe, by studying the laws of nature that guarantee the cohesiveness of the universe. As stated by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah</italic> 2:2:</p>
<p align="blockquote">At the time that a person ponders His works and His great, wondrous actions and creations and sees from them His wisdom which has no measure or end, he immediately loves, praises and glorifies [God] and experiences a great yearning to know the great God, as David stated, &#x201C;My soul thirsts for the Lord, the living God&#x201D; (Psalms 42:3).</p>
<p>We can repeat like poll parrots that God is the Creator of the universe, that He is possessed of this, that and the other attribute, that the Deity is capable of x, y and z, but the fulfillment of the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> does not lie therein. A student can memorize the Pythagorean Theorem: a<sup>2</sup> &#x002B; b<sup>2</sup> &#x003D; c<sup>2</sup>. He can then employ that proposition in solving various mathematical problems involving triangles. But does the student necessarily understand why it is that a<sup>2</sup> plus b<sup>2</sup> equals c<sup>2</sup>? Does he further understand that not only does a<sup>2</sup> &#x002B; b<sup>2</sup> equal c<sup>2</sup> but that a<sup>2</sup> &#x002B; b<sup>2</sup> <italic>must</italic> equal c<sup>2</sup>? The student has committed the proposition to memory. It invariably yields the correct answer. If it works, then good enough&#x0021; That is the sum total of his knowledge. A bright, attentive, tenth grade geometry student who sits in class as each succeeding step in the proof of the Pythagorean Theorem is painstakingly demonstrated by the teacher suddenly experiences an exhilarating intellectual <italic>sim&#x1E25;ah</italic>, an intense intellectual pleasure which comes, not from absorbing the factual information that a<sup>2</sup> &#x002B; b<sup>2</sup> &#x003D; c<sup>2</sup>, but from a sudden recognition that the Pythagorean Theorem is a necessary proposition, that a<sup>2</sup> &#x002B; b<sup>2</sup> <italic>must</italic> equal c<sup>2</sup>, that the universe could not be ordered otherwise. That is far, far different, qualitatively and epistemologically, from merely being able to recall and repeat the bare fact. The latter ability represents a very low level of knowledge; understanding why it <italic>must</italic> be the case, is an entirely different level of knowledge.</p>
<p>As stated by Rambam, <italic>Sefer ha-Mi&#x1E93;vot</italic>, <italic>mi&#x1E93;vot aseh</italic>, no. 3, with regard to the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> commanding us to love God:</p>
<p align="blockquote">That is, that we reflect upon and ponder his <italic>mi&#x1E93;vot</italic> and dicta<sup><xref rid="fn62">10</xref></sup> and his works until we apprehend Him and delight in the ultimate degree of pleasure in apprehending Him. This is the mandatory love. In the words of <italic>Sifri</italic>: &#x201C;For it says, &#x2018;You shall love the Lord your God&#x2019; (Deuteronomy 6:5). I do not know how to love God. Therefore, [Scripture] teaches, &#x2018;And these matters which I command you this day shall be upon your heart&#x2019; (Deuteronomy 6:6). From that you will recognize He who spoke and the universe came into being.&#x201D; Behold we have explained to you that through reflection you will succeed in apprehension and achieve pleasure, and love will come necessarily.</p>
<p>Rambam declares that it is not belief in the existence of God or of His majesty and glory on the basis of faith that constitutes fulfillment of the commandment &#x201C;And you shall love the Lord your God&#x201D;; rather, it is the intellectual pleasure that is born of rational apprehension in which lies fulfillment of the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>. Understanding, and hence the ability to calculate, the precision of astronomical phenomena is one means of achieving such awareness.</p>
<p>Any person can tell you when the <italic>molad</italic> will occur, i.e., when the next new moon can be sighted. Consult a <italic>shul</italic> calendar; the information is succinctly presented, in black and white.<sup><xref rid="fn63">11</xref></sup> If you seek information regarding the movement of the constellations of the zodiac, charts are readily available; look at the chart and the chart will provide the desired information. Does that mean that a person who uses a <italic>shul</italic> calendar or consults a chart understands why the <italic>molad</italic> occurs when it does or why the constellations move in certain patterns? Of course not. The factors governing such phenomena are quite difficult to grasp. A person must invest time and effort in an endeavor to understand such matters. When the Sages declare that a person who is a <italic>yode&#x2019;a le-&#x1E25;ashev tekufot u-mazalot</italic>, a person who is capable of making astronomical calculations but yet fails to do so is remiss, they refer to people who rely upon knowledge of the bare facts. That information can be found in books. Information regarding movements of the constellations, the dates of the solstices and equinoxes and the reappearance of the moon can be memorized. Does that mean that a person who has done so understands why it is that those phenomena occur when they do and why they could not occur at different times? Does that mean that he knows how to calculate the next <italic>tekufah</italic> himself? Or that he will be able to determine the day and hour of the <italic>molad</italic> of the next month and of the month subsequent and of the month after that? Not at all&#x0021; Memorization of recorded facts pertaining to the past and to the present is not sufficient to predict the future. Inferences regarding the future can be extrapolated only if astronomical patterns of the past are analyzed and underlying rules are discovered. That understanding is the key to ascertaining future astronomical events. The Sages declared that the intellectually gifted have an obligation to study astronomy in all its aspects, to understand the phenomena upon which the calendar is based, and to apprehend the regularity of the natural order.</p>
<p>A person capable of mastering those principles is well-positioned to formulate Abarbanel&#x2019;s Argument from Design. The orderliness of the universe did not arise by chance; intelligent design points to the existence of a rational Creator. A person who arrives at a recognition of the existence of the Deity because he recognizes the handiwork of God in the rational structure of the complex order of nature knows that God exists, not because someone told him that such is the case, and not because he possesses a <italic>mesorah</italic> or tradition going back to <italic>Avraham avinu</italic>, but because he himself has demonstrated God&#x2019;s existence anew. Such a person has demonstrated to himself the existence of an intelligent First Cause on the basis of the regularity of the <italic>tekufot</italic> and <italic>mazalot</italic>. The Sages regarded that awareness as the optimum, the ideal. A person who has the requisite intellectual ability is required to engage in the scientific inquiry that will lead to such awareness. By no means is such inquiry a purposeless exercise; it is integral to the fulfillment of the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> &#x201C;And you shall love the Lord, your God.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn64">12</xref></sup></p>
<h1>II. <italic>Three Categories of the Blessing</italic></h1>
<p>But how does this relate to the blessing &#x201C;<italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic>&#x2014;who makes the work of creation&#x201D;? <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 227:1, rules that the blessing <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic> is recited upon witnessing meteors or lightning and upon experiencing an earthquake or extraordinary winds. That is followed by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>&#x2019;s codification in <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 228:1 of the provision of Halakhah requiring recitation of the same blessing upon sighting tall mountains, deep canyons or certain rivers and, finally, in the ruling in <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 229:2, providing for recitation of the blessing upon sighting the sun at the beginning of every 28-year solar cycle as well as upon the occurrence of a number of other astronomical events. The blessing is recited upon observing various diverse phenomena but those phenomena seem to be divided by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> into different categories. Although the <italic>berakhah</italic> has but a single formula, it seems to this writer that there are three separate and distinct types of phenomena for which the blessing was ordained, each of which occasions the blessing for a different reason. Each category evokes praise of God as the Creator of the universe as evidenced in a different and distinct manner. In effect, although there is but one text, connotatively speaking, there are three distinct <italic>berakhot</italic>. Thus, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>&#x2019;s codification of the blessings in three separate chapters becomes readily understandable.</p>
<h3><italic>(1) A Historical Blessing</italic></h3>
<p>Perhaps the most self-evident is the category that includes high mountains and deep canyons. The threshold elevation of a &#x201C;high mountain&#x201D; or the threshold depression of a &#x201C;deep canyon&#x201D; is unclear. However, when I visited the Grand Canyon, I remember commenting that, although I do not know the precise depth of a canyon that serves to trigger the obligation, nevertheless, the Grand Canyon has a <italic>Brisker shi&#x2019;ur</italic>, i.e, its depth is so extraordinary and wondrous that it serves to establish the obligation beyond cavil.</p>
<p>Why does one recite the blessing upon beholding the Grand Canyon, Mount Everest or the like? Neither the Grand Canyon nor Mount Everest was created recently. The National Parks Service did not engage in a project to gouge out a huge canyon in order to provide us with an opportunity for a <italic>berakhah</italic>. Halakhah presumes that the Grand Canyon has been <italic>in situ</italic> since creation and that is precisely why the <italic>berakhah</italic> was ordained. The <italic>berakhah</italic> recited upon beholding such a natural phenomenon is a blessing acknowledging what may be termed the historical phenomenon of <italic>ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic>. In observing the Grand Canyon one observes creation in all its wondrous grandeur. Of course, we constantly observe the phenomenon of creation. But when we gaze at the world about us we are jaded because we have observed exactly the same phenomena yesterday and the day before and, consequently, today&#x2019;s observation does not give us pause or really make an impression upon us. But when we see something extraordinary, a phenomenon that we do not experience on a regular basis, we are required to praise the Almighty for having created the universe at the very beginning of time because that extraordinary encounter causes us, or should cause us, to reflect upon its source. When pronounced on such occasions, the <italic>berakhah</italic> is a historical <italic>berakhah</italic>, i.e., a <italic>berakhah</italic> acknowledging an event that took place at the beginning of history.</p>
<p>The obvious parallel is the blessing <italic>zokher ha-brit</italic> that is recited upon witnessing the appearance of a rainbow. The blessing pronounced over the rainbow is clearly a &#x201C;historical&#x201D; <italic>berakhah</italic>, i.e., it commemorates a singular historical event. The rainbow seen today is hardly novel but it is a phenomenon identical to the rainbow that Noah beheld when he exited from the Ark after the waters of the Deluge receded. God swore to Noah that he would never again visit a flood upon mankind that would destroy all of human civilization and pointed to the rainbow in the sky as a sign of that covenant. The rainbow is designed to make man mindful of God&#x2019;s solemn promise not to permit rains to develop into a second Deluge. The blessing is &#x201C;historical&#x201D; in the sense that it commemorates God&#x2019;s oath to Noah.</p>
<p>This analysis of the nature of the blessing <italic>oseh ma</italic>&#x2019;<italic>aseh bereshit</italic> on such occasions serves to illuminate one aspect of the halakhah governing its recitation. The blessing is recited each time one visits the Grand Canyon or Mount Everest&#x2014;but only if thirty days have elapsed since it was last seen by that individual. A person who lives in a home overlooking the Grand Canyon and wakes up every morning to the sight of this deep and wondrous chasm becomes desensitized very quickly. We walk into the street and look up at the sky, glance down at the grass growing in the lawn or observe the water flowing in a brook and it makes no impression upon us. We do not give such an experience a first, let alone a second, thought. The commonplace is unremarkable. A person who has the Grand Canyon as his neighbor reacts no differently. But if a person has not seen the Grand Canyon for thirty days, and suddenly it appears before him, he becomes, or should become, overwhelmed by the realization of the wondrous nature of the feat God performed in fashioning the canyon as part of His majestic universe.</p>
<h3><italic>(2) A Contemporaneous Blessing</italic></h3>
<p>There is also a second category of phenomena that occasion the blessing <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit.</italic> The text of the blessing is the same, but it is pronounced upon witnessing an entirely different type of phenomenon and acknowledges an entirely different aspect of creation. Upon witnessing lightning one is required to praise God as He &#x201C;who makes the work of creation.&#x201D; On such occasions the blessing praises God, but not for having created lightning in the primordial era. The lightning we observe today was not created 5772 years ago. The lightning is created precisely when we observe it; it is being created before our very eyes. The blessing we pronounce acknowledges the present nature of the creation of that phenomenon. The Sages anticipated that when we witness such an event it will evoke in us the realization that only the Almighty is capable of such a feat. The realization is a form of religious experience and it can be an extremely intense religious experience.</p>
<p>A type of experience that William James does not describe in his <italic>Varieties of Religious Experience</italic> is one that I had in my youth, an experience that was one of the most powerful spiritual moments of my life. I was all of sixteen years old taking a freshman course in college biology. Following the directions of the laboratory instructor, I took a little piece of a leaf, placed it on a slide and inserted the slide under a microscope. Lo and behold, there, under the microscope, chloroplasts were chasing each other, round and round, back and forth, in the leaf. The experience was vivid and exhilarating. Photosynthesis was no longer an intellectual abstraction accepted on the authority of a textbook or on the basis of the testimony of botanists. The microscope became a window through which one could observe <italic>ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic>.</p>
<p>The Sages did not ordain that the blessing <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic> be pronounced upon observing such a phenomenon under a microscope. It is questionable whether they did not do so because of the general principle that Halakhah does not take cognizance of sub-clinical phenomena or simply because they had no microscopes. I have no doubt whatsoever that, logically, absent such considerations, if one should be prompted to recite a <italic>berakhah</italic> upon witnessing lightning, <italic>a fortiori</italic>, one should feel compelled to recite a blessing when observing that phenomenon as well. The spiritual thrill, the intellectual joy, experienced in gazing upon chloroplasts dancing within a leaf is certainly much, much more powerful than is experienced in watching the zigzag of lightning in the sky. A person who has had no first-hand experience of such an event is simply missing an <italic>Erlebnis</italic>; it is something that one must experience in order to appreciate. The blessing pronounced upon witnessing lightning and the like may be categorized as a &#x201C;contemporaneous&#x201D; blessing in the sense that it is a blessing acknowledging God as Creator in the here and now.</p>
<p>In both of those guises the blessing <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic> is designed to underscore the notion that there is no sharp distinction between the miraculous and the natural. <italic>Nes</italic>, or miracle, and <italic>teva</italic>, or nature, are two sides of the same coin. Ramban, in numerous passages in his <italic>Commentary on the Pentateuch</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn65">13</xref></sup> eloquently formulates a distinction between a <italic>nes nistar</italic>, or a hidden miracle, and a <italic>nes nigleh</italic>, or an open miracle. The miraculous nature of hidden miracles is obscured by virtue of the fact that to the beholder the result appears simply as the manifestation of natural occurrences. Open miracles are perceived as the suspension of the natural order. Perhaps even more emphatic are the comments of R. Meir Simchah of Dvinsk, <italic>Meshekh &#x1E24;okhmah</italic>, <italic>Paras&#x1E25;at Be&#x1E25;ukotai</italic>. <italic>Meshekh &#x1E24;okhmah</italic> comments that miracles are not designed as ends in themselves; on the contrary, a <italic>nes</italic> is entirely instrumental. Miracles are designed to impress upon us that all of <italic>teva</italic> is a <italic>nes</italic>; nature is miraculous; the natural order is the greatest of all miracles. The temporary suspension of that order is designed to make us realize that the order and regularity of nature is born of divine decree and subject to divine will. The problem for mankind is that we have become desensitized. Every day the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. We take that for granted, with the result that such phenomena no longer strike us as wondrous. From time to time it is necessary for us to be jolted out of our intellectual complacency. Observation of an extraordinary phenomenon is an occasion to be reminded that miracles are built into the principles governing the universe as variations in the regularity that is the hallmark of nature.<sup><xref rid="fn66">14</xref></sup> Miracles are designed to impress upon us that, in reality, <italic>teva</italic> is the greatest of all miracles. That is why, declares <italic>Meshekh &#x1E24;okhmah</italic>, &#x201C;one who recites <italic>hallel ha-gadol</italic> every day commits blasphemy&#x201D; (<italic>Shabbat</italic> 118b). If a person recites <italic>hallel</italic> every day it is because he feels he must give thanks for what he perceives as miracles performed on his behalf on a daily basis. But God does not perform overt miracles on a daily basis; He does not disturb the laws of nature with any frequency. To presume that He does so is a form of blasphemy. But at the same time we are charged with recognizing that nature itself is miraculous. That is why, explains <italic>Meshekh &#x1E24;okhmah</italic>, a person who recites <italic>ashrei</italic> thrice daily is assured of a share in the World to Come (<italic>Berakhot</italic> 4b). The omnipotence, grandeur and majesty of God is manifest in the ordinary, but regular and ongoing, phenomena described in <italic>ashrei</italic>: &#x201C;You give them their food in due season. You open your hand and satiate every living creature with favor&#x201D; (Psalms 145:15-16). Recitation of <italic>ashrei</italic> serves to acknowledge that the phenomena we regard as natural, ordinary and run of the mill are really miracles wrought by God.</p>
<p><italic>Ba</italic>&#x2019;<italic>alei mussar</italic>, masters of the <italic>mussar</italic> movement, seized upon that notion in offering a resolution of the classic question posed by <italic>Bet Yosef</italic> with regard to the observance of Chanukkah. Why do we kindle the <italic>menorah</italic> each of the eight days of Chanukkah? The Maccabees found suitable oil sufficient for one day. If we commemorate the miracle of the cruse of oil it should be sufficient to kindle the <italic>menorah</italic> on seven consecutive evenings. Since there was enough oil for the first day, the lamps of the <italic>menorah</italic> in the Temple burned quite naturally on the first day. If so, what miracle is commemorated in lighting the Chanukkah <italic>menorah</italic> on the first day? To this the <italic>ba&#x2019;alei mussar</italic> answered that, of course, the Sages ordained the days of Chanukkah in commemoration of the miracle of the cruse of oil. But lest one think that it is only a miracle that occurs as an idiosyncratic event, as an ostensive violation of natural law, that requires celebration and acknowledgement of the power of God, they ordained an additional day designed to celebrate <italic>teva</italic>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let He who told oil to burn come and tell vinegar to burn&#x201D; (<italic>Ta</italic>&#x2019;<italic>anit</italic> 25a). There is no inherent reason why oil must burn or why vinegar should not burn. Vinegar might burn as well as oil, or oil might not burn just as vinegar does not burn. God established the laws of chemistry and physics that make it possible for oil to support combustion and render it impossible for vinegar to do so. Those laws assure that both oil and vinegar will behave in an orderly, consistent and predictable manner. We take it for granted that oil will burn and vinegar will not. We tend to forget that the regularity of nature is nothing short of miraculous. Hence, we are in need of suitable occasions to have that verity impressed upon us. The kindling of the <italic>menorah</italic> on the first day of Chanukkah, according to the <italic>ba&#x2019;alei mussar</italic>, was designed to convey that message globally, i.e., not only with regard to the combustible nature of oil but with regard to the laws of nature in their totality. The blessing <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic>, when pronounced upon witnessing lightning, meteors, etc., forces us to reflect upon the nature of those infrequent occurrences and to recognize that those phenomena, novel and infrequent as they may be, are entirely attributable to the laws instilled in the universe by God.</p>
<p>Thus, there is but one formula in which the blessing is couched, but on differing occasions the blessing is pronounced to express recognition of one or another of the two distinct roles fulfilled by God as the Creator of the universe: 1) recognition of God as the author of creation as evidenced by remarkable primordial artifacts available for our observation; 2) acknowledgment of God as the source of the laws of nature which at times give rise to unusual and seemingly spontaneous phenomena.</p>
<h3><italic>(3) An Evocative Blessing</italic></h3>
<p>The blessing <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic> is employed in yet a third manner. The third guise of the blessing is neither an acknowledgment of the wondrous, unparalleled historical event that the creation of the universe represents, nor is it a blessing acknowledging a present novel occurrence in the realm of nature; indeed, in its third form, the blessing is not occasioned by any extraordinary phenomenon at all. The blessing in its third form is employed to teach, to underscore and to reinforce the notion that God is, as He is described in the liturgy of the morning prayer, He who &#x201C;each day continuously renews the work of creation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In order to appreciate the purpose and function of this third form of the blessing <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic>, it is necessary to provide some elucidation of the doctrine reflected in the blessing. It seems to me that this description of God as the &#x201C;<italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic>&#x201D; is designed to teach what philosophers term the &#x201C;Doctrine of Continuous Creation&#x201D; or, sometimes, the &#x201C;Doctrine of Constant Conservation.&#x201D; At times, those terms are used interchangeably but they are not really synonymous. Rambam presents that doctrine in two separate places, in <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah</italic> 1:1-2 and in his formulation of the Thirteen Principles of Faith in his <italic>Commentary on the Mishnah, Sanhedrin</italic>, Introduction to <italic>&#x1E24;elek,</italic> the First Principle.</p>
<p>In <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah,</italic> Rambam writes:</p>
<p align="blockquote">The principle of all principles and the pillar of all wisdom is to know that there is a First Being; He brings every existing thing into existence; and all things that exist in heaven, on earth and in what is between them did not come into existence other than through the veracity of His existence. And if it could be conceived that He does not exist, no other thing could exist.</p>
<p>The first two clauses of that statement are entirely straightforward: God is the First Being and the Prime Cause of all that exists in the created universe. In the second of these clauses Rambam emphasizes that nothing in the celestial spheres or on earth could have come into existence other than through God&#x2019;s creative power. In his final statement Rambam makes an even more profound assertion: there can be no ongoing existence of created entities other than through the medium of God&#x2019;s eternal existence. Hence, were God not to exist, the continued existence of all things would be impossible. Rambam is declaring that creation is not a once in an eternity phenomenon. In a very real sense, creation takes place on a continual, continuous and ongoing basis. Were God to have created the universe and then gone on an eternal sabbatical by removing His existence, the universe could not have survived. The presence of God is needed in order to guarantee the continued existence of the universe.</p>
<p>In writing &#x201C;if it could be conceived that He does not exist,&#x201D; Rambam is not quite willing to concede that such a notion is actually conceivable. Rambam is asserting that, since God is a necessary Being, we cannot even conceive His non-existence because the non-existence of the Deity is, in effect, an oxymoron. Although that argument is not identical to Anselm&#x2019;s Ontological Argument for the existence of God, it certainly brings that proof to mind. Be that as it may, were we able to conceive of the eventuality of the non-existence of the Deity coming to pass, the universe itself would also cease to exist. It is the presence of God that makes possible the ongoing existence of the universe.</p>
<p>Rambam makes this point even more forcefully in his <italic>Commentary on the Mishnah</italic> in the course of developing the first of his Thirteen Principles. In addition to telling us simply that belief in the existence of the Deity is a fundamental principle of faith he continues with the statement:</p>
<p align="blockquote">He is the cause of the existence of all existing things; In Him is the continuity of their existence and from Him comes their endurance. Let the absence of His existence not occur to the mind, for in the absence of His existence the existence of all created things would be nullified and there would not remain any existing thing whose existence would endure.</p>
<p>That comment is simply an amplification of what Rambam says much more succinctly in the <italic>Mishneh Torah</italic>. Rambam here emphasizes that the existence of the Deity is necessary, not only because there must be a First Cause, but also because of God&#x2019;s role in the nature of a dynamo infusing the universe with existence.</p>
<p>One can perhaps best understand that concept in terms of modern phenomena. Consider electricity. I am neither a physicist nor an electrical engineer. Nevertheless, I have a rudimentary understanding of the nature of electricity. The generator must operate constantly if there is to be electricity. If one shuts down the generator, there is no longer an electrical current. One cannot simply create a quantity of electricity and then go on vacation expecting the stored electricity to continue to flow. A generator is necessary in order continuously to produce new electricity. &#x201C;Existence&#x201D; is created by the Almighty. Thus, according to Rambam&#x2019;s depiction of the role of God, God is not merely the First Cause of all existence; He is the <italic>ongoing</italic> cause of existence. Without His ongoing presence there could not be any existence whatsoever.</p>
<p>The Kalam philosophers presented the Doctrine of Continuous Creation in a very particular way. Rambam, in his <italic>Guide of the Perplexed</italic>, Part I, chapter 73, sixth proposition, reports that Kalam philosophers employed a notion similar to that of continuous creation in constructing a proof for the existence of the Deity. They asserted that the universe was not created from a substance that Jewish philosophers term &#x201C;<italic>&#x1E25;omer hiyuli</italic>,&#x201D; i.e., hylic substance or primordial matter, that is endowed with accidents. Those philosophers maintained that matter cannot exist without accidents and hence no entity could exist if God did not recreate accidents during every moment of existence. As a consequence of assuming that substance cannot exist without accidents, the Kalam philosophers concluded that, since by definition a hylic substance lacks accidents, the existence of a hylic substance is impossible.</p>
<p>The Kalam also accepted what the translators call an &#x201C;atomic&#x201D; notion of time, i.e., the notion that time is composed of discrete particles, or &#x201C;atoms.&#x201D; I prefer to use the term &#x201C;quantum&#x201D; notion of time rather than &#x201C;atomic&#x201D; notion of time. Based upon those two notions, Kalam philosophers asserted that cloth that is dyed black does not retain its color because the dye has penetrated the cloth; rather, the &#x201C;blackness&#x201D; of the cloth is an accident created by God when the black pigment comes into contact with the cloth. But the &#x201C;blackness&#x201D; is of no duration; God must repeatedly recreate blackness during every moment of time. Absent God&#x2019;s re-creation of accidents there would be nothing in existence except the underlying hylic substance, a notion they considered to be incomprehensible since they asserted that one cannot conceive of a material substance having no quality other than sheer existence.</p>
<p>The Kalam have a latter-day counterpart in the philosophy of Ren&#x00E9; Descartes. Descartes presented a similar proof for the existence of the Deity predicated upon his conception of time.<sup><xref rid="fn67">15</xref></sup> Descartes regarded time, not as a kind of wave or flow, or as a measure of motion, but as, literally, a fourth dimension made up of infinitesimal particles which have been termed &#x201C;quanta.&#x201D; The Cartesian notion of time gives rise to a serious problem. If the universe exists in time and if time is a series of discrete and unconnected quanta, how does any entity traverse time by moving from one time quantum to the next? A transportation system would be required to move physical entities from one such time quantum to the next. That transportation system is supplied by God. But how does He accomplish that feat? The notion that God drags physical entities across nothingness in incomprehensible. So what does God do in order to provide for the durability of the universe? God&#x2019;s solution, declares Descartes, is to recreate the universe in every moment of time. God recreates the universe in every quantum of time; He creates the universe anew every microsecond. The continued existence of the universe would be impossible without continuous divine re-creation. Thus, the very existence of the universe is a proof of the existence of God.</p>
<p>That proof of the existence of God is quite similar to the Kalam argument rejected by Rambam. Although not spelled out in that discussion in the <italic>Guide</italic>, Rambam was compelled to reject the Kalam argument, in part, because Rambam had a totally different notion of time. Rambam does not regard time as a created entity and certainly not as composed of atoms or quanta. According to Rambam, time is an accident of motion, and motion is an accident of matter. Even more fundamentally, as Rambam argues in his discussion of the Kalam theory, God, although he is the First Cause, created causal laws which, in turn, serve as a sufficient explanation for the duration of accidents. Accordingly, Rambam derisively dismisses the Kalam proof out of hand.</p>
<p>Rambam&#x2019;s rejection of the Kalam notion of constant creation is not a contradiction to his assertion, both in the <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah</italic> and in his <italic>Commentary on the Mishnah</italic>, of God&#x2019;s ongoing role in the preservation of the universe. First, and perhaps foremost, Rambam decries only denial of causality and the accompanying notion that accidents must be recreated, but makes no such statement with regard to <italic>&#x1E25;omer hiyuli</italic>.</p>
<p>Moreover, as I understand Rambam, he insists upon the Doctrine of Continuous Conservation while rejecting a Doctrine of Constant Creation. Although philosophers may obscure the issue by using the terms interchangeably&#x2014;and I am also guilty of having done so in my book <italic>Bircas ha-Chammah</italic>&#x2014;these are fundamentally two different and distinct doctrines. Rambam, in his <italic>Commentary on the Mishnah</italic> and in <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah</italic>, does not formulate a Doctrine of Continuous Creation; rather, he advances a Doctrine of Constant Conservation. According to Rambam, the universe may well have been created but once in all of eternity, but it requires the same amount of force, energy or &#x201C;creative power&#x201D; to maintain the universe in existence and to sustain it as was required in order to create it in the first instance. Existence, according to Rambam, is an ephemeral quality that must constantly be renewed. The infusion of existence needed to sustain the created universe can come only from divine existence. Hence, were divine existence, which Rambam refers to in <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah</italic> as &#x201C;<italic>amitat me&#x1E93;i&#x2019;uto&#x2014;</italic>the veracity of His existence,&#x201D; to be removed from the universe, the universe could no longer exist and would return to sheer nothingness.</p>
<p>This leads directly to what I have referred to as the third guise of the blessing <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic>. This third pronouncement of the blessing employs the same formula as the first two but it differs in that it is recited in recognition and affirmation of the Doctrine of Constant Conservation of the universe. It is a blessing through which we acknowledge that God&#x2019;s presence is needed on a continual and ongoing basis for the preservation of the created universe with the result that, absent His presence, there could not be a world for us to inhabit.</p>
<p>But how is that doctrine reflected in the words of the blessing &#x201C;<italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic>?&#x201D; When we went out on the morning of April 8<sup>th</sup>, on <italic>erev Pesa&#x1E25;</italic>, and looked up at the sun, did the sun look any different from the way it looked a day earlier on April 7<sup>th</sup>? If one were to have gazed heavenward on the first day of <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;</italic>, on April 9<sup>th</sup>, would one have missed anything in one&#x2019;s observation of the sun that one was able to see a day earlier? Exactly the same visual sensation was available on April 7<sup>th</sup>, April 8<sup>th</sup> and April 9<sup>th</sup> as well on any other day of any year. Observation of the sun on April 8<sup>th</sup>, 5769 was entirely unlike witnessing lightning, meteors or the like. The latter are phenomena that one does not witness with any degree of regularity. In contradistinction, the sun can be observed every single day. Nothing of significance changes in the perception of the sun from one day to the next. If so, why was a blessing required at the beginning of a new solar cycle on April 8<sup>th</sup> more so than on any other day?</p>
<p>The blessing, when pronounced on the occasion of <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> represents a third type of <italic>berakhah,</italic> one that may be termed an &#x201C;evocative&#x201D; <italic>berakhah</italic>. That pronouncement of the <italic>berakhah</italic> is not responsive in the sense that we now see and marvel at some phenomenon that the Almighty created five thousand seven hundred and sixty-nine years ago or in the sense that we are responding to a phenomenon that He is creating here and now before our very eyes, in that a moment ago there was no lightning and now there is lightning. The <italic>berakhah</italic> as recited on the occasion of <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> is evocative rather than responsive. It is meaningful only when pronounced upon internalizing what is perceived and reflecting thereupon. One cannot appreciate the purpose of the blessing unless one internalizes the experience. The blessing is designed to promote reflection and introspection, which, in turn, serve to give rise to a feeling that one must express gratitude to the Almighty for continuously conserving the universe. It is through recitation of the blessing that such awareness is evoked.</p>
<p>And what is the phenomenon that occasions this reflection? It is the sun&#x2019;s return to the place in the firmament which it occupied on the same day of the week and at the same hour of the day on which it was created during the six days of creation. As such, it represents the beginning of a new solar cycle. But one could not possibly know that this has occurred simply by gazing at the sun. It is impossible to realize what has occurred without preparing for the event. A person who is intellectually prepared for the event recognizes what it is that occurs on April 8<sup>th</sup> upon the culmination of one twenty-eight year cycle and the beginning of another; perforce, he must recognize that the orbit of each of the heavenly spheres is a <italic>galgal ha-&#x1E25;ozer</italic>, cyclical and never-ending, going back and forth, back and forth, over and over again. Furthermore, he must recognize that this is so only because God guarantees the existence of the created universe through <italic>amitat me&#x1E93;i&#x2019;uto,</italic> the veracity of His existence; otherwise, the universe would not exist at all. Pronouncement of the blessing is designed to spur reflection upon this phenomenon; praise of God as the ongoing &#x201C;Maker of the work of Creation&#x201D; evokes recognition of God&#x2019;s constant conservation of the universe.</p>
<h1>III. <italic>Other Occasions for an Evocative Blessing</italic></h1>
<p>The commencement of the 28-year solar cycle is not the only event for which the Sages ordained the blessing <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic> in its evocative guise. The <italic>Beraita</italic> cited by the Gemara, <italic>Berakhot</italic> 59b, also declares that the blessing must be recited upon observing a variety of celestial events. As understood by early-day authorities, the <italic>Beraita</italic> describes the return of celestial bodies to the places in the firmament they occupied at the time of creation.<sup><xref rid="fn68">16</xref></sup> Such events are similar in nature to the event that occasions <italic>Birkat ha</italic>-<italic>&#x1E24;ammah</italic>. The occurrence of such events certainly cannot be discerned by observation. Indeed, in practice, we do not recite the blessing on the other occasions enumerated in the <italic>Beraita</italic> because we do not know how to determine their occurrence. <sup><xref rid="fn69">17</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the blessing on those occasions is in the same guise as <italic>Birkat ha</italic>-<italic>&#x1E24;ammah</italic>; the blessing is designed to evoke reflection upon the ongoing cyclical nature of the celestial spheres.</p>
<p>I believe that it is possible to demonstrate that recitation of <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic> on the occasion of <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> and on other occasions enumerated in the <italic>Beraita</italic> are not the only occasions regarding which the Sages at least considered ordaining recitation of the blessing in its third guise. <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> occurs only once in twenty-eight years and presumably the other events occur with even less frequency. But another event was considered as a candidate for recitation of the same type of blessing. The Gemara, <italic>Berakhot</italic> 59a, states:</p>
<p align="blockquote">R. Joshua ben Levi said, &#x201C;If one sees the sky in all its purity, he says, &#x2018;Blessed is He who has wrought the work of creation.&#x2019;&#x201D; When does he do so? Abaye said, &#x201C;When there has been rain all the night and in the morning the north wind comes and clears the heavens.&#x201D; And they differ from Rafram bar Papa quoting R. &#x1E24;isda. For Rafram bar Papa said in the name of R. &#x1E24;isda, &#x201C;Since the day when the Temple was destroyed there has never been a perfectly clear sky, since it says, &#x2018;I clothe the heavens with blackness and I make a sackcloth their covering&#x2019;&#x201D; (Isaiah 50:3).</p>
<p>Why should that phenomenon occasion a blessing? Rashi comments, &#x201C;For such was its creation but afterward it was covered by clouds.&#x201D; In our day, even in the absence of cloud cover, it is certainly impossible to behold the sky in its pristine glory in any urban locale. There is simply too much industrial pollution that obscures the sky, not to speak of light pollution. However, Abaye declares that one who wishes to observe the sky as it appeared at the time of creation before it was obscured by clouds may do so by waiting for a rainfall that lasts all night long. Then, if the rain is blown away by a strong wind, the completely unobscured sky can be seen in all its purity and the blessing o<italic>seh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic> is pronounced.</p>
<p>According to Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation of the Gemara, this is not a novel guise of the blessing. The blessing on such occasions, as categorized by Rashi, is no different from the blessing recited upon observing high mountains or deep chasms. The blessing is historical in nature in the sense that it acknowledges a primordial phenomenon present at creation. In the atmospheric conditions described, the sky is revealed in its pristine glory and appears as it did in its primordial state. That is not an everyday phenomenon. Ordinarily, the sky is covered by pollution, smoke, clouds, etc. On the rare occasion that it appears in its original state, one is required to praise God for having created a glorious universe.</p>
<p>If Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation is accepted, it is the <italic>berakhah</italic> in its historical guise that is required. If the blessing is identical in nature to the blessing recited upon sighting a tall mountain, a deep canyon or the <italic>yam ha-gadol</italic>, the blessing is not to be recited if the phenomenon is witnessed a second time within a thirty-day period. There does not appear to be any explicit evidence of such a limitation.</p>
<p>But for Rashi&#x2019;s comment, I would offer an entirely different analysis of the nature of the blessing. It may even be possible to read that analysis into Rashi&#x2019;s words as well. The phenomenon described by the Gemara seems to me to be comparable, not to a tall mountain or a deep canyon, but to the phenomenon of lightning. Lightning appears <italic>sua sponte</italic>; it is a novel phenomenon created before our very eyes. It seems to me that the Gemara is telling us that, when there is a prolonged rainfall and then a strong wind that blows, the resultant phenomenon appears as a new creation comparable to lightning. The sky in a place such as Bonaire is not at all comparable to the sky we are accustomed to seeing. The biblical phrase that speaks of the &#x201C;multitude of stars&#x201D; cannot be appreciated unless one has had such an experience. The sky in such far-flung areas is covered &#x201C;wall to wall&#x201D; by a blanket of light. Imagine a rain followed by a wind that would turn our sky into the sky over Bonaire. A person witnessing such an event would enjoy an exhilarating experience in the nature of an impression of a wondrous phenomenon being created before his eyes. Viewing the sky upon alighting from a plane at night in Bonaire certainly gives rise to an even greater thrill than watching lightning zigzag across the sky.</p>
<p>In metropolitan areas that experience is possible only when the atmospheric conditions described by the Gemara have occurred. On such occasions, the blessing <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic> is in the nature of an acknowledgement of a contemporaneous creation occurring in the here and now.</p>
<p>How frequently is the blessing ordained for that phenomenon recited? Whenever the event occurs; whenever cleansing rain falls and the clouds are dispersed with the result that the sky is completely clear. If new clouds appear and, in turn, are swept away, the result is a new &#x201C;creation&#x201D; mandating a new <italic>berakhah,</italic> just as a second bout of lightning after clouds have dissipated is a new &#x201C;creation&#x201D; occasioning a new blessing. According to this analysis, the blessing required on perceiving such a phenomenon is in the guise of the earlier-described second form of the blessing. According to either analysis, the blessing upon the appearance of the heaven &#x201C;in its purity&#x201D; is in the nature of one or the other of the usual forms of the blessing <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic>.</p>
<p>There is, however, a parallel text in the <italic>Yerushalmi</italic>, the Palestinian Talmud, <italic>Berakhot</italic> 9:2. The <italic>Yerushalmi</italic> also records that the blessing <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic> is pronounced upon seeing &#x201C;the firmament in its purity.&#x201D; But, in the <italic>Yerushalmi</italic>&#x2019;s discussion, R. Huna explains that the blessing is recited &#x201C;only in the rainy season after three days, as it is written, &#x2018;And now they did not see light that is bright in the skies but a wind passes and cleanses them&#x2019;&#x201D; (Job 37:4), i.e., the blessing is recited after incessant rain spanning a three-day period. R. Moshe Sofer, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 55, expresses bewilderment: Why is the blessing occasioned only by three days of rainfall? <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> amends the text to read &#x201C;after thirty days&#x201D; but fails to explain why the blessing is recited only after a thirty-day period of rainfall.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the <italic>Yerushalmi</italic> describes a phenomenon totally different from that described by the Babylonian Talmud and that it is describing a blessing of a different genre. As evidenced by the citation of the verse in Job, the phenomenon described occurs after a three-day period of total darkness. It is not the rain <italic>per se</italic> that causes the phenomenon, but the darkness that occurs because of rainfall. When was the first occasion on which the sun was not visible for three days and then suddenly appeared? During the period of creation the sun suddenly came into being at the beginning of the fourth day. The reenactment of that event necessitates the blessing. But what is the nature of the blessing? It is not praise of God occasioned by the creation of something before our eyes nor is it an occasion on which we behold a vestige of primordial creation. Rather, it is a reenactment of <italic>ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic>. The blessing is evocative in that it calls upon us to reflect upon <italic>ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic> and to recognize that creation is an ongoing phenomenon. It calls upon us to remember that the sun originally came into existence only on the fourth day; the reappearance of the sun after darkness is a form of re-creation. Our observation of the sun being recreated should impress upon us the verity that the sun&#x2014;and indeed all of creation&#x2014;must continually be infused with existence. That reflection should evoke praise of God who constantly functions as the <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;asheh bereshit</italic>.</p>
<p>The statement of the <italic>Yerushalmi</italic> is not recorded either by Rambam or by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>. But it is an example of a proposed blessing in the nature of the third category earlier described. The only blessing &#x201C;<italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic>&#x201D; of the third category that is normative is <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic>. In that guise it is a novel blessing, a rare expression of thanksgiving to the Almighty for His constant conservation of the universe. It is a form of praise that can properly be uttered only upon reflection; it is the product of intellectual awareness.</p>
<h1>IV. <italic>Evidence of the Evocative Nature of</italic> Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</h1>
<p>It is possible to demonstrate that the blessing <italic>oseh ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic> pronounced on the occasion of <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> is different from every other recitation of the blessing in a very significant way. The determination of the 28-year solar cycle is based upon the calculation of the day and hour of the vernal equinox as calculated by Shmu&#x2019;el. Those calculations, in turn, presume that the length of the solar year is the same as that assumed by the Julian calendar. But we know very well that the Julian calendar was inaccurate. The Sages of the Gemara knew it to be inaccurate. Rav Adda, one of the <italic>Amora&#x2019;im</italic>, is reported to have established different and more accurate <italic>tekufot</italic> which we use for other purposes of Halakhah. Rav Adda realized that Shmu&#x2019;el&#x2019;s assumption with regard to the length of the solar year was imprecise. According to Rav Adda&#x2019;s more accurate calculation, the dates on which equinoxes and solstices occur are different from those of Shmu&#x2019;el. We employ Shmu&#x2019;el&#x2019;s <italic>tekufot</italic> only for <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic>, for determination of the commencement of recitation of the <italic>tal u-matar</italic> prayer for rain and possibly for one other arcane area of Jewish practice, <italic>viz</italic>., refraining from drinking water drawn on the evening of the <italic>tekufah</italic>. But if the Sages of the Talmud realized that Shmu&#x2019;el&#x2019;s calendar was inaccurate why, in ordaining <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic>, did they ordain a blessing to commemorate a phenomenon that does not occur at the time it is purported to occur?</p>
<p>The reason they did so with regard to recitation of <italic>tal u-matar</italic> is not difficult to apprehend. Not everyone is a <italic>yode</italic>&#x2019;<italic>a le</italic>-<italic>&#x1E25;ashev tekufot u-mazalot</italic>; not everyone is sufficiently proficient in the science of astronomy to be able to calculate the autumn equinox so that he will be able to determine the appropriate date to commence recitation of <italic>tal u</italic>-<italic>matar</italic>. What is a simple, untutored, unlettered Jew supposed to do? Everyone is capable of calculating Shmu&#x2019;el&#x2019;s <italic>tekufah</italic>. According to Shmu&#x2019;el, each season is exactly 91&#x00BC; days in length. Once a person is apprised of the date and hour of the beginning of any season, calculating the beginning of any future season is extremely simple. Accordingly, the Sages adopted Shmu&#x2019;el&#x2019;s calculations, inaccurate though they were, in ordaining the prayer for rain.</p>
<p><italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> is much more difficult to understand. The blessing seems to be occasioned by a non-occurring event. Since the solar year is decidedly not precisely 365 days in length, the sun does not return to its place of origin on the day and hour of the original creation every twenty-eight years. In fact, in the 5772 years that have elapsed since creation the actual <italic>tekufat Nisan</italic> has never recurred on its original day and hour. One authority, <italic>Teshuvot Mas</italic>&#x2019;<italic>et Binyamin</italic>, no. 101, declares that that phenomenon will never recur. Yet the Sages did seek an opportunity to impress upon people the Doctrine of Constant Conservation of the universe. The accepted popular view was that the solar year is 365 days in length. That view was independently known and accepted by the populace at large for other liturgical purposes, <italic>viz</italic>., for recitation of the <italic>tal u-matar</italic> prayer. Since the blessing is born of reflection and is designed to evoke acknowledgment of a basic verity, they seized upon this popular assumption and harnessed it as a vehicle for disseminating and reinforcing a fundamental principle of faith.</p>
<p>This becomes even more obvious if we analyze <italic>Birkat ha</italic>-<italic>&#x1E24;ammah</italic> more closely. Why did the Sages not ordain that the blessing be recited Tuesday night? The <italic>tekufah</italic> of Shmu&#x2019;el occurs at six o&#x2019;clock Tuesday evening but we do not recite the <italic>berakhah</italic> until the sun rises on Wednesday morning. The <italic>tekufah</italic> in <italic>Ere&#x1E93; Yisra&#x2019;el</italic> on Tuesday evening, April the 7<sup>th</sup>, occurs at 5:39 P.M., give or take a few seconds. It occurs, not at 6:00 P.M., but at 5:39 P.M., because solar time depends upon the precise degree and minute of longitude. We have adopted a convention of establishing time zones varying by intervals of one hour. Accordingly, to speak of the time as 6:00 P.M. is accurately to identify the time only at the geographic midpoint of the time zone. True solar time will vary up to a half-hour earlier or a half-hour later depending on particular location east or west of the midpoint of the time zone. So, to speak of <italic>tekufat Nisan</italic> occurring at 6:00 P.M. is really to say that it occurs at 6:00 P.M. solar time which is 5:39 P.M. Jerusalem time on our clock. Sunset in Jerusalem does not occur until 5:50 P.M. local time. The sun remains visible during the period of time between the occurrence of the <italic>tekufah</italic> at 5:39 P.M. and sunset at 5:50 P.M.</p>
<p>If so, why did the Sages ordain that <italic>Birkat ha</italic>-<italic>&#x1E24;ammah</italic> be delayed until sunrise Wednesday morning which is many hours after the actual <italic>tekufah</italic>? True, the blessing may be recited only if one actually sees the sun. But, if the <italic>berakhah</italic> celebrates the return of the sun to its position at the time of creation, the Sages could have ordained that the blessing be recited Tuesday evening during the eleven-minute window between 5:39 P.M. and 5:50 P.M.</p>
<p>The answer, I believe, lies in the fact that at the time of creation the sun was placed in the firmament at 5:39 P.M. but, since the sun was created, not at the close of the third day, but at the beginning of the fourth day, sunset on the first Tuesday evening did not occur after the <italic>tekufah</italic> at 5:50 P.M., but at 5:39 P.M., i.e., the sun was created at sunset. In our day, sunset occurs eleven minutes after the <italic>tekufah</italic> but that was not the case at the time of the sun&#x2019;s creation.</p>
<p>Were one to have been present at the creation of the sun it would have been impossible to recite a blessing because the sun had already set. For the Sages to ordain recitation of <italic>Birkat ha</italic>-<italic>&#x1E24;ammah</italic> during the period of time after the <italic>tekufah</italic> that the sun remains visible on Tuesday evening would be incongruous and even self-contradictory. Ostensively, we witness a reenactment of a solar phenomenon that occurred during <italic>ma</italic>&#x2019;<italic>aseh bereshit</italic> and thereupon recite <italic>Birkat ha</italic>-<italic>&#x1E24;ammah</italic>. But at <italic>ma</italic>&#x2019;<italic>aseh bereshit</italic> the sun was not visible&#x0021; So how is it comprehensible that we pronounce a blessing acknowledging our perception of the sun&#x2019;s presence in a certain position at the time of <italic>ma</italic>&#x2019;<italic>aseh bereshit</italic> if, at <italic>ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic>, the sun was not visible at that hour? Therefore, the Sages ordained that the blessing be pronounced at an hour commemorating the first visual appearance of the sun subsequent to its creation. Were one to have been present at <italic>ma</italic>&#x2019;<italic>aseh bereshit</italic>, the earliest opportunity to recite the blessing would have been at the first appearance of the sun at sunrise on Wednesday morning.<sup><xref rid="fn70">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The point is clear. No novel astronomical event occurred at the time of the first sunrise on Wednesday morning. And, of course, no novel astronomical event took place on April 8<sup>th</sup> at sunrise. The blessing is neither historical nor contemporaneous, using the terms as they have been defined earlier; the blessing is evocative in the sense that the Sages desired that appearance of the sun on April 8<sup>th</sup> spur us to reflect upon <italic>ma&#x2019;aseh bereshit</italic> and to acknowledge the role of <italic>amitat me&#x1E93;i</italic>&#x2019;<italic>uto</italic> in the constant conservation of the universe.</p>

<ftnote id="fn59">7. The following discussion is based upon a lecture delivered by the author at Yeshiva University on March 15, 2009.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn60">8. Indeed, R. Moshe of Coucy, <italic>Sefer Mi&#x1E93;vot Gadol</italic>, <italic>mi&#x1E93;vot aseh</italic>, no. 46, enumerates an obligation to engage in those calculations as one of the 613 commandments. That is also the position of <italic>Sefer Yere&#x2019;im</italic> (Vilna, 5659), no. 260. That position is based upon the interpretation presented by the Gemara, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 75a, of the verse &#x201C;You shall observe and fulfill, for it is your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the nations&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 4:6). &#x201C;Which wisdom is it that [is regarded as such] in the eyes of the nations?&#x201D; queries the Gemara. The immediate answer of the Gemara is: &#x201C;That is, calculation of <italic>tekufot</italic> and <italic>mazalot</italic>.&#x201D; The Gemara&#x2019;s statement is formulated in support of the dictum of R. Samuel bar Na&#x1E25;mani in the name of R. Yo&#x1E25;anan: &#x201C;Whence [is it derived] that it is incumbent upon a person to calculate <italic>tekufot</italic> and <italic>mazalot</italic>? As it is said &#x2018;and you shall observe and perform etc.&#x2019;&#x201D; The talmudic interpretation establishing an obligation is based upon employment of the phrase &#x201C;and you shall observe and perform&#x201D; in the biblical verse, a term that connotes a binding imperative.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Rambam also considers the exhortation rooted in this verse to be a mandatory obligation but does not include it in his enumeration of the 613 commandments. In the introduction to his <italic>Sefer ha-Mi&#x1E93;vot, shoresh bet</italic>, Rambam formulates the principle that the number 613 includes only commandments that are explicitly formulated in the Pentateuch. Excluded from that catalogue of <italic>mi&#x1E93;vot</italic>, asserts Rambam, are all commandments derived on the basis of rabbinic hermeneutics for, declares Rambam, were these also to be included, &#x201C;the number of <italic>mi&#x1E93;vot</italic> would equal many thousands.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote>In his responsa collection, <italic>Pe&#x2019;er ha-Dor</italic>, ed. R. Abraham Chaim Freimann (Jerusalem, 5694), no. 347, Rambam responds to a query regarding the purpose of the commandment with a citation of a dictum of R. Meir, &#x201C;Ponder His works for from that you will recognize He who spoke and the universe came into being.&#x201D; Rambam also cites that statement in <italic>Hilkhot Yesodei ha</italic>-<italic>Torah</italic> 2:2 and in <italic>Sefer ha</italic>-<italic>Mi&#x1E93;vot</italic>, <italic>mi&#x1E93;vot aseh</italic>, no. 3. The source of the dictum is probably <italic>Sifri</italic>, Deuteronomy 6:6. Cf., editor&#x2019;s note, <italic>Pe</italic>&#x2019;<italic>er ha</italic>-<italic>Dor</italic>, no. 347.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Ramban, in his glosses on Rambam&#x2019;s <italic>Sefer ha-Mi&#x1E93;vot</italic>, <italic>shoresh alef</italic>, s.v. <italic>ve-hateshuvah ha-revi&#x2019;i</italic>, understands that, for Rambam, the commandment is rabbinic in nature. That position is also espoused by R. Betzalel Ze&#x2019;ev Shafran, <italic>Teshuvot Ravaz</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 32, who asserts that Rambam omits this commandment from his list of the 613 <italic>mi&#x1E93;vot</italic> because he regarded it to be rabbinic in nature. That understanding of Rambam is contradicted by the comments of Rambam both in his <italic>Sefer ha-Mi&#x1E93;vot</italic> and in his <italic>Pe&#x2019;er ha-Dor</italic>. See also R. Moshe Sofer, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, VIII, <italic>Kove&#x1E93; Teshuvot</italic> (Jerusalem, 5742), no. 26.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Ramban himself asserts that the study of <italic>tekufot</italic> and <italic>mazalot</italic> is not mandatory even as a rabbinic command. Nevertheless, he regards such activity as a desideratum and explains that the statement of the Gemara is hortatory in nature urging those who are capable of doing so to engage in those calculations and to announce forthcoming astronomical occurrences to the nations of the world.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn61">9. See also Rambam, <italic>Guide of the Perplexed</italic>, Part III, chap. 28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn62">10. In this exposition in <italic>Sefer ha</italic>-<italic>Mi&#x1E93;vot</italic> Rambam includes understanding of Torah as integral to knowledge, and hence love, of God. That is consistent with Rambam&#x2019;s view that the commandments are the product of divine reason (see <italic>Guide of the Perplexed</italic>, Part III, chap. 26) and his doctrine of negative attributes. Accordingly, Torah, as the manifestation of divine reason, is integral to the essence of God. Hence, knowledge of Torah is knowledge of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn63">11. R. Zevi Elimelech Shapiro of Dinov, <italic>Derekh Pekudekha</italic>, <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> 4, <italic>&#x1E25;elek ha</italic>-<italic>ma</italic>&#x2019;<italic>aseh</italic>, sec. 10, declares that the statement of the Gemara, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 75a, concerning calculating <italic>tekufot</italic> and <italic>mazalot</italic> reflects a mandatory obligation and hence, at the very minimum, every person should calculate the <italic>molad</italic> each successive month rather than rely upon a calendar for that information.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn64">12. Rambam, <italic>Pe</italic>&#x2019;<italic>er ha</italic>-<italic>Dor</italic>, no. 347, makes this point explicitly in responding to an interlocutor who questioned the need to engage in such an exercise. See <italic>supra</italic>, note 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn65">13. See, for example, Genesis 7:17, 35:13 and 46:15; Exodus 6:12; Leviticus 18:29 and 26:11; and Deuteronomy 11:13.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn69">17. See <italic>ibid</italic>., pp. 81-83.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn70">18. The same point may be demonstrated in yet another manner. The <italic>tekufah</italic> is an astronomical event that occurs at a specific moment in time. But the hour of that occurrence must be described in local time which is dependent upon longitude. In light of the time difference between Israel and the United States the moment in time described as 6:00 P.M. in Jerusalem is 11:00 A.M. in New York City. Although the <italic>tekufah</italic> occurs at 6:00 P.M. solar time in Jerusalem, at that moment, the clock in New York reads 11:00 A.M. If so, why do we delay <italic>Birkat ha-&#x1E24;ammah</italic> until Wednesday morning even in New York? The issue was first raised by R. Elijah David Rabinowitz-Te&#x2019;umim (known as the <italic>Aderet</italic>), Chief Rabbi of Mir and later of Jerusalem, who ruled that in Russia, where the sun was visible after the time of the <italic>tekufah</italic>, the blessing be recited Tuesday afternoon at the time of the actual <italic>tekufah</italic> rather than be delayed until Wednesday morning. A Jerusalem scholar, the late R. Moshe Nachum Spira, accepted that position and argued that in Europe and the United States the blessing must be recited on Tuesday and may not be recited on Wednesday. For a discussion and critique of those views see this writer&#x2019;s <italic>Bircas haChammah</italic>, pp. 95-96 and 237-242.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Nevertheless, it is the accepted practice throughout the world to delay <italic>Birkat ha</italic>-<italic>&#x1E24;ammah</italic> until sunrise of the morning following the <italic>tekufah</italic>, i.e., Wednesday morning. The Sages ordained that the blessing be recited at the hour that the sun became visible in the Land of Israel at the time of creation, i.e., at sunrise of the day following the <italic>tekufah</italic>. They similarly ordained that Jews all over the world recite the blessing when the sun becomes visible on the morning following the <italic>tekufah</italic>. This may serve to explain why Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Berakhot</italic> 10:18, adds the phrase &#x201C;in the morning,&#x201D; which is not found in the Gemara, in ruling that one should pronounce the blessing following the <italic>tekufah</italic> &#x201C;when one sees [the sun] on Wednesday <italic>in the morning</italic>.&#x201D; Rambam&#x2019;s emphasis is upon the point that it is not sufficient to observe the sun after the <italic>tekufah</italic>, but that the blessing is to be delayed until the following morning. If it is understood that the blessing is evocative and does not precisely commemorate an astronomical event, it is quite understandable that the Sages sought to promulgate uniformity of observance and based themselves upon the <italic>realia</italic> of the Land of Israel in establishing sunrise as the time for recitation of the blessing throughout the world.</ftnote>

The rising number of challenges to the validity of <italic>hetter iska</italic> agreements is unwelcome but nevertheless represents eloquent testimony to the increased use of such instruments within the Jewish community. Recognition of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> by courts of competent jurisdiction as creating a joint venture is a matter of both religious and economic significance to observant Jews. The importance of that issue prompts this writer to revisit the topic<sup><xref rid="fn71">1</xref></sup> in order (1) to examine the propriety of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> as a means of avoiding the biblical prohibition against paying or receiving interest; (2) to explicate the nature of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> as a valid halakhic construct; (3) to investigate the question of whether lack of enforceability in a civil court impacts upon the halakhic validity of a <italic>hetter iska</italic>; (4) to analyze the relevant judicial decisions regarding the efficacy of a <italic>hetter iska</italic> in American law; and (5) to delineate the manner in which the instrument should be drafted in order to achieve the desired halakhic and legal result.</p>
<h1>I. <italic>The Propriety of a</italic> Hetter Iska</h1>
<p>Biblical law forbids both exaction of interest by a creditor and payment of interest by a debtor. The underlying considerations are two-fold in nature: 1) The obligation to perform charitable deeds includes a responsibility to help the indigent by means of non-interest bearing provident loans. 2) Interest accepted in return for extending a loan involving neither risk of capital nor personal service is perceived as a form of unjust enrichment.</p>
<p>Although in biblical days the economic structure of society was predominantly agrarian and loans were sought primarily for personal purposes, the strictures against usury apply with equal force to loans extended for commercial purposes. During the Middle Ages, Jews, particularly when they were forbidden to own land, turned to commercial pursuits. Frequently, they became merchants engaged in the buying and selling of goods and produce. Such pursuits required capital investment of sums which few individual Jews possessed. Loans were generally not available unless they were also of financial benefit to the lender. Since interest was not permitted, ways and means had to be found to facilitate commercial endeavors without violation of either the letter or the spirit of Jewish law.</p>
<p>The earliest attempt to overcome this difficulty was that of the sixteenth-century Polish scholar known as R. Mendel Avigdors of Cracow, who composed the earliest version of the <italic>hetter iska</italic>. The <italic>hetter iska</italic> is a document which specifies the terms and conditions under which money is advanced by one individual to another. Its legal purpose is to create a partnership arrangement as distinct from a debtor-creditor relationship.</p>
<p>The issue with which rabbinic thinkers were forced to grapple was the propriety of seizing upon lacunae in the law and fashioning contrivances in order to circumvent the violation. A subterfuge may avoid technical violation of the law but nevertheless thwart the spirit of the law.</p>
<p>Virtually every system of law employs legal fictions for reasons of expediency. A corporation is a legal person and is accorded such status in order to achieve perfectly cogent and moral results. Such &#x201C;myths&#x201D; are essentially definitional. The law determines how it wishes to treat certain arrangements and coins a term for use as a type of verbal shorthand in referring to such arrangements. At times, the law, particularly in areas of taxation, provides for options. Determination by a businessman of the beginning and end of his fiscal year is an obvious but relatively trivial example. In such matters, as Judge Learned Hand famously remarked, &#x201C;Anyone may arrange his affairs so that his taxes shall be as low as possible&#x2026;. Over and over again the Courts have said that there is nothing sinister in so arranging affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn72">2</xref></sup> An individual acting in such a manner is not guilty of moral turpitude.</p>
<p>Jewish law is quite familiar with arrangements designed to avoid the onus of applying the full force of the law. In rabbinic literature there is a term for such an arrangement; it is known as a &#x201C;<italic>ha&#x2019;aramah</italic>,&#x201D; a term that probably may best be translated literally as &#x201C;a cleverness.&#x201D; The term &#x201C;device&#x201D; probably best captures the flavor of the term without connotation of a moral judgment. Such devices fall into three distinct categories: (a) those that are disdained as inconsistent with the spirit of the law; (b) those that, for one reason or another, are regarded as commendable and actively encouraged; and (c) those with regard to which there is an attitude of complete neutrality.</p>
<p>Perhaps the earliest example of a <italic>ha&#x2019;aramah</italic> involves regulations pertaining to tithing. Talmudic exegesis establishes that biblical law requires tithing only of produce brought into an abode through the gates of the courtyard. The Gemara, <italic>Berakhot</italic> 35b, bemoans the fact that, &#x201C;while earlier generations were wont to bring in their produce by way of the front door in order to make it liable to tithing, later generations bring in [the produce] by way of roofs, yards, or enclosures in order to exempt [the produce] from tithing.&#x201D; Clearly, that statement reflects a negative attitude toward the moral legitimacy of the &#x201C;later generations&#x201D; who avail themselves of such expedients. Indeed, according to some early-day authorities, the subterfuge in question was formally banned by rabbinic law.</p>
<p>The reason for the negative view <italic>vis-&#x00E1;-vis</italic> utilization of such expedients is self-evident. The purpose of the tithe was to provide a livelihood for the Levites who were required to serve in the Temple and who constituted a leisure class charged with providing religious instruction on behalf of the entire populace. Were tithes not to be forthcoming, the Levites would have been compelled to seek employment as artisans or laborers, thereby making it impossible for them to discharge their sacred mission. The spirit of the law would certainly have been thwarted. Thus, this is an example of a disdained <italic>ha</italic>&#x2019;<italic>aramah</italic>.</p>
<p>The second category includes devices that are designed actively to promote conformity with the manifold provisions of law. The first-born male offspring of a cow or a sheep belonging to a Jew is sanctified from birth to be brought to the Temple as a sacrificial offering. With the destruction of the Temple, sacrifices are no longer feasible. However the sanctity of the first-born animal is in no way mitigated. The animal may not be used as a beast of burden; it is forbidden to drink its milk or use its wool. The animal is literally a &#x201C;sacred cow&#x201D; that roams virtually at will&#x2014;as is the case even today in some Hindu communities with regard to animals they regard as sacred&#x2014;until the animal develops a blemish rendering it unfit as a sacrifice. Unless and until that occurs, the animal is a halakhic nuisance in the sense that it is of no benefit to either God or man but poses an ongoing potential for inadvertent sin, &#x201C;a tort waiting to happen.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The sole remedy is to prevent the animal from achieving sanctified status by transferring ownership of the pregnant animal to a non-Jew before it gives birth. Subsequent to parturition both animals may be reconveyed to the original Jewish owner. Commandments regarding the first-born commemorate the sparing of Jewish first-born in Egypt while the first-born of the Egyptians perished in the last of the ten plagues. Hence, the first-born of an animal belonging to a non-Jew is not sanctified.<sup><xref rid="fn73">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>No one has ever suggested that it is improper to seek such transfer of title on the grounds that it is a subterfuge designed to frustrate the purpose of the law. Such circumvention of the law represents an instance in which fulfillment of the underlying purpose has become impossible, i.e., the animal cannot be brought as a sacrificial offering because the Temple no longer stands. Despite that factor, the law is not a dead letter; the restrictions governing sanctified animals remain in full force and effect. The only way to avoid transgression and violation of both the letter and spirit of the law lies in obviating its provisions by causing title to become vested in a non-Jew. That is so even if the calf or lamb and its mother are both subsequently repurchased from the non-Jew. Under such circumstances, employment of a &#x201C;device&#x201D; to accomplish that end is worthy of approbation.</p>
<p>The final category is best exemplified by the practice of selling <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic>, i.e., food products not suitable for consumption during Passover, to a non-Jew. The sale is effected before the advent of the holiday and, typically, the same foodstuffs are repurchased from the non-Jew upon conclusion of the holiday. To some, the transaction has the appearance of a charade since the parties are fully aware <italic>ab initio</italic> that the effect of the sale will be rescinded at the earliest permissible opportunity.</p>
<p>In point of fact, this arrangement is entirely innocuous. Scripture forbids a Jew to retain any economic interest in <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> during the course of the Passover week. A Jew in possession of such foodstuffs on the eve of Passover may avoid the onus of transgression in one of three ways: (1) He may consume such foods in their entirety, a feat beyond human capability if the quantity is gargantuan, or inadvisable in the extreme in the case of a copious quantity of alcoholic beverages made from grain. (2) He may totally destroy such items by burning or the like, a procedure that may prove to be cumbersome and is wasteful but, nevertheless, entirely permissible. (3) He may transfer title to a non-Jew who, since the 613 biblical commandments are binding only upon Jews, is in no way subject to the prohibition. Jewish law does not accord preference to any one of these options over the others. Accordingly, the expedient of sale to a non-Jew is regarded as both halakhically and morally neutral; it is neither encouraged nor discouraged. Choice of that option is generally dictated by considerations of practicality and conservation of wealth. There are no restrictions upon acquiring <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> after the holiday, even <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> owned by a Jew before Passover, provided that the sale to a non-Jew prior to the advent of the holiday has been properly consummated.<sup><xref rid="fn74">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>To the extent that there are intimations of criticism in rabbinic literature regarding such sales, the concern is entirely with regard to legal niceties.<sup><xref rid="fn75">5</xref></sup> Proper modes of formal conveyance, or <italic>kinyan</italic>, must be employed in transferring title. More significantly, there can be no valid transfer without a meeting of minds. Both parties must grasp the final and irrevocable nature of the transaction. Neither party may regard it is a <italic>pro forma</italic> ritual or liturgical act devoid of actionable effect. Small wonder, then, that rabbinic eyebrows were raised on occasion, particularly when the purchaser was an untutored and legally unsophisticated peasant.</p>
<p>In the modern world loans occur in situations varied and sundry. In antiquity, loans were almost always provident in nature. A farmer&#x2019;s crop failed and as a result he was forced to resort to a loan in order to purchase seed for planting the next year&#x2019;s crop. A person became temporarily incapacitated and was reduced to seeking a loan to put bread on the table. A loan of that nature is described by Scripture as an act of charity: &#x201C;that your brother may live with you&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:36). Charity assumes many guises. A loan represents a higher form of charity than a gift because the impoverished recipient receives full benefit of the funds advanced without being deprived of dignity. Such loans represent fulfillment of a divine command for which a person dare not demand compensation at the hands of his fellow. Moreover, unlike the majority of commandments with regard to which Scripture does not reveal the underlying rationale, in promulgating the requirement that a loan be interest-free, Scripture is quite explicit with regard to the reasoning: the borrower is in need of funds to sustain himself. The Bible regards profiting from human misery as ignominious; to demand interest is to compound the plight of an already destitute person. In earlier centuries, the Church regarded the taking of interest to be prohibited by natural law; the odiousness of interest-taking was not based upon dogmatic revelation but was regarded as readily apprehensible by the unaided light of moral reason.</p>
<p>In antiquity, all loans were provident in nature. At some point in human history society found it expeditious to rely upon middlemen to transfer commodities from producer to consumer. Tradesmen require at least a modest amount of capital in order to function in that capacity. Only with the advent of the industrial revolution and the construction of factories for the production of consumer goods did the need for vast amounts of capital arise; only in the modern era does capital represent the most prevalent form of generating more capital.</p>
<p>A person is under divine command to come to the assistance of his fellow who is in need. However, he is under no obligation to assist his fellow in amassing wealth. The rationale underlying the prohibition against interest-taking is alleviation of human misery. Yet the law acquires a life of its own. In general, Jewish law regards implementation of the law to be independent of the ends the law is designed to promote. That is the case even when those ends have been revealed to man. For that reason, in the Jewish legal system, policy considerations do not figure prominently in judicial decision-making. Hence, the prohibition against giving or taking interest is fully applicable, not only in situations in which societal goals are not advanced thereby, but even in situations in which societal goals may actually be thwarted.</p>
<p>A device that would enable a lender to reap profit from a provident loan would certainly offend the spirit of the law. But a device that restructures the transaction and renders it an investment makes it possible for the individual providing the financing to participate in the profits generated by the investment. Properly crafted so that it does not violate technical strictures, such a device is morally neutral when used in the context of a commercial enterprise.</p>
<p>Many such &#x201C;devices,&#x201D; although entirely permissible under biblical law, were interdicted by rabbinic decree. Those restrictions were instituted either as a means of constructing a &#x201C;fence&#x201D; around the biblical law because of fear that if a particular legitimate practice were to be sanctioned it would rapidly result in other practices violative of biblical law or because the arrangement might be regarded as interest-taking in the eye of an unsophisticated beholder. Practices that have come to be known as Islamic banking include a variety of devices forbidden to Jews by rabbinic decree rather than by biblical law. A repurchase agreement is a case in point: instead of lending money at interest, a &#x201C;lender&#x201D; sells a piece of property and agrees to repurchase it at a specified future date for a higher sum. The transaction is formally structured as a sale coupled with a repurchase agreement, but is actually a subterfuge. The funds advanced for the &#x201C;purchase&#x201D; of the parcel of real property are really a disguised loan since recovery is guaranteed. The &#x201C;seller&#x2019;s&#x201D; sole motivation is use of the funds in the interim; the &#x201C;purchaser&#x2019;s&#x201D; sole motivation is the interest he receives in the form of an enhanced repurchase price.</p>
<p>The primary device recognized by Jewish law as an acceptable means of avoiding the prohibition against extending or receiving an interest-bearing loan is known as a <italic>hetter iska</italic> or &#x201C;permissible venture.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn76">6</xref></sup> Its function is to substitute some form of profit-sharing representing a return on invested funds for what would otherwise have been structured as an interest-bearing loan.</p>
<h1>II. <italic>The Nature of a</italic> Hetter Iska</h1>
<p>The formula of the original <italic>hetter iska</italic> was based upon a ruling recorded in <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 167:1, which provides that funds may be advanced on the condition that the recipient use the funds to buy and sell merchandise on behalf of the person advancing the funds until such time as a stipulated profit has been earned; profit over and above that amount then accrues without limit to the recipient. During the initial period, the recipient acts solely as a commercial agent on behalf of the principal who advanced the funds; only after the originally stipulated profit has been earned does the deposit revert to the status of a loan and the recipient, who was heretofore considered a bailee, becomes a debtor. Subsequently, no profit whatsoever accrues to the lender and hence there is no question of forbidden payment of interest. The text incorporating this formula, which was drawn up by R. Mendel Avigdors for use in lieu of a promissory note, appears in <italic>Na&#x1E25;alat Shiv&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 40, and is known as the &#x201C;<italic>Hetter Iska</italic> of Maharam.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Ga&#x2019;on of Vilna, (known as the Gra), <italic>Bi&#x2019;ur ha-Gra</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 167:1, expresses amazement at <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>&#x2019;s ruling that money may be lent in this manner. In the situation which is outlined, the &#x201C;agent&#x201D; undertakes to engage in the purchase and sale of merchandise on behalf of the &#x201C;principal.&#x201D; However, his sole motivation for doing so is the stipulated agreement between the parties to the effect that the sum advanced will subsequently be available for the recipient&#x2019;s own personal use as a loan. Labor or personal services performed on behalf of a creditor as an inducement to extend a loan is a form of interest forbidden by Jewish law. Performance of such services without compensation is, in fact, a disguised interest premium exacted as a precondition demanded for conversion of the funds to a loan. It is for this reason that <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> stipulates that the &#x201C;agent&#x201D; must be paid for his services, although the payment may be nominal in nature. Such nominal payment to avoid the stricture against usury is analogous to the peppercorn recognized in common law as consideration validating a contract. The Gra quite evidently regarded token payment as inadequate; forgoing usual compensation was regarded by him as a form of interest-taking.<sup><xref rid="fn77">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In terms of making capital available for commercial purposes, an obvious drawback with regard to this arrangement is that the &#x201C;interest&#x201D; received by the lender is not tied to the period of time his capital is used by the borrower and does not provide for accrual of interest or sharing of additional profit in the event that repayment is delayed. Subsequently, a modified form of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> which had the effect of eliminating this difficulty was developed by the 18<sup>th</sup>-century authority, R. Abraham Danzig of Vilna, renowned as the author of <italic>&#x1E24;ayyei Adam</italic> and <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Adam.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn78">8</xref></sup> Under the terms of this modified <italic>hetter iska</italic>, the recipient accepts fifty percent of the funds as a deposit and fifty percent as a loan. The sum advanced in this manner is termed &#x201C;half-loan, half-deposit&#x201D; in rabbinic literature. Any expenditure of a commercial or investment nature is deemed to be a joint venture in which both parties share equally. Thus, technically, half the profits accrue to the &#x201C;principal&#x201D; and half to the borrower. The principal may, of course, agree to accept no more than a certain stipulated amount of the profits and the agent may demand that the agreement specify that profits exceeding that amount accrue to the agent as compensation for his services.</p>
<p>Transformation of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> into a transaction in the form of half loan, half deposit is to the advantage of the investor in the sense that only half his funds are at even theoretical risk. Another advantage is that it makes accrual of presumed periodic profits possible with the result that procrastination in a repayment results in greater profit to the investor.</p>
<p>It may well be the case that this form of <italic>hetter iska</italic> was also developed, in part, to overcome the objection raised by the Gra, <italic>viz</italic>., that mere token consideration in return for personal services is not sufficient to overcome the taint of usury. That objection is grounded in the concern that the recipient expends time and effort on behalf of the financier during the initial period of the arrangement in which the funds are invested solely on behalf of the financier and, clearly, that he is motivated to do so only because he desires that the sum advanced together with the profits generated during that period convert to an interest-free loan as rapidly as possible. However, it may be argued that this is not the case with regard to funds received as a half loan, half deposit. In the latter case, the recipient would expend no less time and effort were he to seek investment opportunities only for the funds he receives as an interest-free loan. No additional time or effort is expended because the investor&#x2019;s funds are commingled with the recipient&#x2019;s borrowed funds. Quite to the contrary, it is more likely than not that any entrepreneur would welcome the opportunity to double the quantity of merchandise he seeks to buy with his own already available funds by acting at the same time as an agent for another individual desirous of acquiring the same type of merchandise or in making a similar investment. Doubling the quantity purchased or the amount of money invested affords the opportunity for taking advantage of economy of scale.</p>
<p>To offer a simple example: Jumbo certificates of deposit require a much higher minimum investment than ordinary certificates of deposit, but yield a higher premium. The amount of paper work involved in securing a jumbo certificate of deposit is no different from the amount of paper work required to secure an ordinary certificate of deposit. Assume that A has only &#x0024;50,000 to invest but that the minimum requirement for a jumbo certificate of deposit is &#x0024;100,000. Assume also that B has &#x0024;50,000 available to invest. Under such circumstances prudence and good business sense would dictate that one of the parties should offer to take custody of the other party&#x2019;s &#x0024;50,000, commingle the funds, and invest them in a joint certificate of deposit as tenants in common. The motive for doing so is not altruism in helping a friend but self-interest in becoming able to qualify for a higher yield on one&#x2019;s own investment. Similarly, in purchasing merchandise, it is highly likely that, the greater the quantity bargained for, the lower the cost per unit. Hence, it is certainly arguable that in accepting funds in the form of half loan, half deposit, the recipient is motivated solely by self-interest and performs no additional services as compensation for receipt of the loan.<sup><xref rid="fn79">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In neither of these formulations is the <italic>hetter iska</italic> a subterfuge or legal fiction. The determining characteristic which distinguishes a loan from a deposit or bailment is that a debtor must always repay the full amount borrowed, regardless of any losses he may suffer, while the laws of bailment provide that the bailee need not indemnify the bailor in the event of certain types of losses. Since the <italic>hetter iska</italic> generates a principal-agent relationship, no payment need be made if <italic>bona fide</italic> losses occur while the borrower functions as a bailee. Under the terms of Maharam&#x2019;s formula there is no obligation whatsoever on the part of the recipient if the loss is sustained during the initial period; according to the modified version, such losses are borne equally by the &#x201C;principal&#x201D; and the &#x201C;borrower.&#x201D; The &#x201C;principal&#x201D; may, however, set forth certain stipulations to protect himself against loss. He may, for example, stipulate that the agent must bear all losses unless the merchandise purchased is at all times under the latter&#x2019;s personal supervision or unless the agent produces two trustworthy witnesses who testify that he had indeed properly discharged all aspects of his trust.</p>
<p>Conditions such as these serve to protect the capital of the creditor, but do not at all guarantee the payment of &#x201C;interest&#x201D; in the event that the debtor denies that he has earned a profit. This drawback was overcome by means of a further stipulation providing that the &#x201C;principal&#x201D; may assume that a profit has been earned and that this presumption may be nullified only upon the solemn oath of the &#x201C;agent&#x201D; to the contrary. That stipulation has meaningful implications because of a singular socio-religious factor unique to Jews, Quakers, and few others. Pious Jews abjure oaths, even when called upon to swear to matters which are entirely true. Accordingly, the net effect of a stipulation requiring an oath to substantiate an absence of profit is to assure that the creditor will receive &#x201C;interest&#x201D; in the form of a guaranteed &#x201C;profit&#x201D; even if, in fact, no profit has been earned in any commercial endeavor. Thus, even if no profit has been realized, the stipulated payment is legitimately proffered as a fee for exoneration from the oath that would otherwise be imposed in order to substantiate the absence of profits. The payment is in the nature of an accord and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Whether or not such an oath may be demanded when the &#x201C;principal&#x201D; has personal knowledge of the truth of the &#x201C;agent&#x2019;s&#x201D; claim that no profit has been earned is a matter of some dispute. Some authorities assert that an oath attesting to facts already known by the party demanding the oath is forbidden as an oath taken &#x201C;in vain,&#x201D; i.e., to no purpose. Of course, if an oath cannot be exacted, payment in lieu of the oath cannot be demanded.<sup><xref rid="fn80">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In an article that originally appeared in <italic>Torah she-be-al Peh</italic>, XIX (5727), 100-105, and was reprinted in his posthumously published <italic>Mishkan Shiloh</italic> (Jerusalem, 5755), pp. 281-288, Rabbi Shiloh Rafael notes that, in our day, an aversion to oath-taking is no longer to be taken for granted. Understandably, there may therefore be reluctance on the part of some persons to utilize the customary <italic>hetter iska</italic>. The lender may well anticipate a contingency in which the borrower will indeed swear quite truthfully that he has earned no profit. Rabbi Rafael suggests that the requirement for an oath on the part of the debtor be replaced with a stipulation giving the creditor the right to examine the financial records of the debtor and the right to participate in all decisions with regard to the expenditure of the sum advanced. The agreement between the parties would provide that this right be abrogated upon payment of a specified sum or percentage of the capital at the discretion of the debtor.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in recent years, perhaps because of concern for the qualms expressed by the Ga&#x2019;on of Vilna, a new form of <italic>hetter iska</italic> has developed among members of the stringently observant community. That agreement is colloquially referred to as the &#x201C;<italic>hetter iska</italic> of Bnei Brak&#x201D; because of the locale in which it gained currency.<sup><xref rid="fn81">11</xref></sup> The arrangement is designed to eliminate any possible halakhic pitfall by providing that the funds are advanced in their entirety solely as an investment. Provision is made for payment of a stipulated periodic rate of return as profit upon the investment with any balance in excess of that rate of return to be retained by the recipient. Since there is no loan whatsoever, there can be no taint of interest. All other provisions of such an agreement are identical to those of a standard <italic>hetter iska</italic>. A return, even when no profit has been realized, is assured by stipulating a presumption of profit rebuttable only by a solemn oath. Capital is protected by stipulating that only the testimony of two halakhically qualified witnesses is acceptable as proof of loss. The drawback of that arrangement is that, unlike with regard to other forms of <italic>hetter iska</italic>, since no portion is in the form of a loan, the funds advanced are at risk in their entirety.</p>
<p>The <italic>hetter iska</italic> was originally designed to facilitate the lending of capital for commercial purposes. Since the capital was, in fact, invested in mercantile enterprises, and since the creditor assumed a measure of risk, the relationship which was formed was&#x2014;factually as well as technically&#x2014;that of partners in a business venture. However, with the passage of time, use of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> became more and more widespread. Greater and greater numbers of Jews earned their livelihood as craftsmen or as hired laborers. The use of a <italic>hetter iska</italic> by a person who is not in any way engaged in a business enterprise appears to be nothing more than a subterfuge. A prominent twentieth-century decisor, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, II, no. 62, totally ignoring earlier responsa dealing with this problem, strongly implies that a <italic>hetter iska</italic> may by employed only when the borrower is engaged in business ventures. Moreover, declares Rabbi Feinstein, both parties must know the nature of the commercial venture for which the money is advanced for &#x201C;[the <italic>hetter iska</italic>] is not an incantation or charm.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn82">12</xref></sup> Rabbi Feinstein adds that the written agreement should state that the money advanced must be used for ventures in which it may reasonably be anticipated that the total profit will be at least twice the amount of the stipulated return. Thus, according to <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, the <italic>hetter iska</italic> is reserved for use in situations in which the interest paid is, in reality, no more than the actual anticipated profit realized on the portion of the merchandise acquired on behalf of the creditor.<sup><xref rid="fn83">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The question of the efficacy of a <italic>hetter iska</italic> in conjunction with non-personal loans was raised earlier, at approximately the turn of the twentieth century, and discussed in detail by Rabbi Shalom Mordecai Schwadron, <italic>Teshuvot Maharsham</italic>, II, no. 216. Advancing a view contrary to that later espoused by <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, Rabbi Schwadron justifies the use of a <italic>hetter iska</italic> in conjunction with loans that are entirely of a personal nature. He concedes that when the funds have not been used for commercial purposes, and no profits have been earned, no interest need be paid. The borrower, however, certainly has the legal and halakhic option of using the money advanced for such purposes; indeed, that is the <italic>prima facie</italic> purpose of the loan as stated in the written agreement. Under the terms of the agreement the financier may demand a solemn oath that the money has not, in fact, been used to generate profit and that, in fact, no profit has been earned. The amount stipulated as &#x201C;accord and satisfaction&#x201D; is then paid by the recipient solely as a means of avoiding the oath which he is otherwise bound to swear.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, R. Joseph Saul Nathanson, <italic>Teshuvot Sho&#x2019;el u-Meshiv</italic>, <italic>Mahadurah Kamma</italic>, III, no. 160, justified an <italic>iska</italic> arrangement in conjunction with personal loans, for at least some purposes, on entirely different grounds. According to this authority, a loan which makes it possible for an individual to continue practicing his profession or to retain his income-generating employment is to be deemed a commercial enterprise. Therefore, according to <italic>Sho&#x2019;el u-Meshiv</italic>, a teacher who is burdened by debt or by personal expenses may borrow funds under an <italic>iska</italic> arrangement if failure to receive the loan would force him to abandon his profession and to seek a livelihood in some potentially more lucrative endeavor. Since the loan enables him to continue in his occupation, the loan constitutes a form of <italic>iska</italic> in which the financier becomes a partner. The application of this line of reasoning to student loans designed to enable the student to pursue studies which will qualify him to enter a profession or to make him eligible for higher salaried employment is obvious.</p>
<p>In another responsum, <italic>Sho&#x2019;el u-Meshiv</italic>, <italic>Mahadurah Telita&#x2019;ah</italic>, I, no. 133, Rabbi Nathanson sanctioned an <italic>iska</italic> arrangement in order to enable the recipient to repay a debt and thereby to avert the forced sale of his home. This is categorized as an <italic>iska</italic> by <italic>Sho&#x2019;el u-Meshiv</italic> by virtue of its service in preventing loss of capital resulting from the otherwise economically forced sale of the house and/or the opportunity to realize the contemplated appreciated value of the property.</p>
<p>The permissive views of <italic>Sho&#x2019;el u-Meshiv</italic> were sharply disputed in the early part of the twentieth century by R. Meir Arak, <italic>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</italic>, I, no. 108. <italic>Imrei Yosher</italic> maintained that the concept of <italic>iska</italic> is limited to profits realized from the investment of capital advanced or from sale of merchandise or goods acquired with such capital. Profits realized from avoidance of loss or from income derived from personal employment do not constitute the fruits of a joint venture and hence, according to <italic>Imrei Yosher</italic>, do not justify use of a <italic>hetter iska</italic>. This latter view is consistent with the position of most authorities, including <italic>Ginat Veradim</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, <italic>klal</italic> 6, no. 4; <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh ha-Rav</italic>, <italic>Hilkhot Ribbit</italic>, sec. 42; <italic>Ki&#x1E93;ur Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> 66:10; and <italic>Erekh Shai</italic> 177:7.</p>
<p>A contemporary scholar, Rabbi Moshe Sternbuch, <italic>Mo&#x2019;adim u-Zemanim</italic>, VI, no. 41, sec. 2(7), s.v. <italic>ve-hineh,</italic> points out that with widespread investment in the stock market on the part of small investors there can be no question with regard to the creditor&#x2019;s lack of personal knowledge that no profit has been earned. Indeed, it is not uncommon for individuals who borrow money for personal purposes to use such funds in an attempt to reap short-term profits in the securities market. Since the creditor cannot know that this has not, in fact, occurred, he may, according to all authorities, stipulate that an oath be sworn to that effect.</p>
<h1>III. <italic>Must a</italic> Hetter Iska <italic>Be Enforceable in a Civil Court?</italic></h1>
<p>Whether or not the terms of a <italic>hetter iska</italic> are enforceable in a secular court, and whether a civil court would treat the instrument as a loan agreement or as establishing a joint venture would appear to be of little import in determining its validity in Jewish law. The principle &#x201C;<italic>dina de-malkhuta dina</italic>&#x2014;the law of the land is the law&#x201D; is irrelevant with regard to financial and commercial dealings between members of the Jewish faith.<sup><xref rid="fn84">14</xref></sup> The law of the land does not supersede the rules of Jewish jurisprudence, most particularly in situations in which the state has no interest in thwarting private arrangements between the parties.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the matter becomes more complex with regard to the validity of contracts. Contracts are generally not enforceable unless there is a meeting of minds, i.e., seriousness of intent and reliance by both parties. Thus, even though transfer of real property can be consummated by delivery of consideration, the Gemara, <italic>Kiddushin</italic> 26a, declares that in a locale in which a deed is customarily delivered to the purchaser the sale is not valid unless such a deed is executed. The reason, as explained by Rashi, <italic>ad locum</italic>, is that in the absence of a deed, the purchaser does not rely upon the conveyance. The question, then, is whether there is seriousness of intent with regard to assumption of a contractual obligation that cannot be enforced in a secular court.<sup><xref rid="fn85">15</xref></sup> Ordinarily, that is not a problem because Jewish law requires its adherents to abjure recourse to secular courts and to submit all disputes to a <italic>bet din</italic> for adjudication. It also categorizes any recovery obtained in a civil court that would not have been allowed by a <italic>bet din</italic> as extortion.</p>
<p>The issue becomes germane primarily in instances involving a Jew and a non-Jew, in which the contract is not enforceable in civil law but is designed to satisfy a requirement of Jewish law.<sup><xref rid="fn86">16</xref></sup> The earliest discussion of this issue arose with regard to the sale of <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> before Passover to a non-Jew. In the 19th century, the Austro-Hungarian Empire imposed a tax upon conveyance of chattel in the form of payment for a tax stamp that they required be affixed to the bill of sale. Jews were not in the practice of purchasing stamps for use in conjunction with the sale of <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> and were denounced to government officials as tax-evaders. The matter reached the ears of the Emperor Franz Josef, who had a justly-deserved reputation as a philosemite. His reaction was that it is common knowledge that sale of <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> is not a mercantile transaction designed for profit but entirely a matter of religious scruple. As such, the Emperor had no desire to burden religious practice by taxation.<sup><xref rid="fn87">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the Emperor was satisfied, R. Baruch Frankel, author of <italic>Barukh Ta&#x2019;am,</italic> reportedly was not. R. Baruch Frankel inferred from the Emperor&#x2019;s response that failure to affix tax stamps did indeed render the sale void and unenforceable. If so, he was hesitant with regard to its validity in Jewish law. Presumably his concern was that, even if in Jewish law the contract is valid in form, the non-Jew would not rely upon the conveyance. R. Moshe Sofer, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 113, disagreed, but only because he understood Austro-Hungarian law differently (and probably more correctly). <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> asserted that failure to abide by the tax statute did not serve to void the sale; it compelled only payment of the tax prior to institution of legal proceedings based upon the transaction.<sup><xref rid="fn88">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>A somewhat different version of the problem appears in a later responsum authored by the son-in-law of R. Baruch Frankel, R. Chaim Halberstam, <italic>Teshuvot Divrei &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, II, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 36. For reasons of Jewish law, conveyance of <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> is usually accompanied by sale or lease of real property so that the <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> may be transferred by <italic>kinyan</italic> in the form of <italic>&#x1E25;a&#x1E93;er</italic>, i.e., placement in the beneficiary&#x2019;s domain, and by accession or <italic>agav karka</italic>. The Austro-Hungarian Empire apparently had a law similar to England&#x2019;s Statute of Frauds requiring that transfer of real property be in writing. <italic>Divrei &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>&#x2019;s interlocutor apparently had concern with regard to the validity in Austro-Hungarian law of an instrument drafted in Hebrew.<sup><xref rid="fn89">19</xref></sup> Apparently, in that jurisdiction, instruments written in a foreign language were of no legal effect.<sup><xref rid="fn90">20</xref></sup> <italic>Divrei &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> responds that, under the applicable civil law, absent a valid deed, the sale is not void but merely voidable <sup><xref rid="fn91">21</xref></sup> and, moreover, that even when accompanied by a written instrument, the sale is voidable unless registered in a land registry office.<sup><xref rid="fn92">22</xref></sup> Nevertheless, argues <italic>Divrei &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, the validity of both an oral transfer and an unregistered transfer, even if void under the law of the land, is determined solely by Jewish law. <italic>Divrei &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> dismisses the contention that the non-Jew does not rely upon such a conveyance with the comment that a non-Jew &#x201C;knows that the Jew will not renege without acquiescence of the non-Jew in order that his <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> not become forbidden.&#x201D; In other words, the non-Jew recognizes the critical nature of the transaction in avoiding transgression of a biblical command and, since he is confident that the Jew will not wish to sin, he relies upon the conveyance because he is convinced that the Jew will make no attempt to seek to rescind the sale by suing in a civil court.</p>
<p>A rather similar argument was advanced by R. Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor, <italic>Be&#x2019;er Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 7. As earlier noted, Jewish law provides that in a locale in which sale of real estate is generally memorialized by a deed, a sale for cash alone is not valid. <italic>Be&#x2019;er Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> contends that if, however, it is patently clear that the seller will not renege, e.g., he seeks to divest himself of land because it is not productive (<italic>mipnei ra&#x2019;atah</italic>), the sale is valid even if consummated only by delivery of consideration. <italic>Be&#x2019;er Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> argues that a Jew will not renege on a sale of <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> on the eve of Passover because invalidating the sale would leave him with <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> from which he may derive no benefit. Hence the non-Jew has every reason to rely upon even an unconventional mode of transfer.<sup><xref rid="fn93">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>A similar problem presented itself with regard to sale of farmland in the Land of Israel in anticipation of the sabbatical year in order to avoid difficulties arising from observance of the laws of the sabbatical year. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire from 1517 until after World War I. Ottoman law did not recognize the validity of transfer of real property unless the transfer was recorded in a land-registry office. That procedure was not followed in the transfer of land in advance of the sabbatical year. R. Abraham I. Kook, <italic>Shabbat ha-Are&#x1E93;</italic>, introduction, sec. 13, arrives at a conclusion similar to that earlier recorded by <italic>Divrei &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> in the context of the sale of <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic>, <italic>viz</italic>., &#x201C;when the essence of the transfer is to obviate a prohibition, the grantor firmly intends to convey [by means of] such a transfer and the grantee [firmly intends] to acquire, there is proper reliance.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn94">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a similar manner, R. Shalom Mordecai Schwadron, <italic>Teshuvot Maharsham</italic>, I, no. 20, permitted use of a <italic>hetter iska</italic> by a bank even though, contrary to applicable civil law, no provision for a <italic>hetter iska</italic> was incorporated in the by-laws of the bank. That view was endorsed by R. Meir Arak, <italic>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</italic>, I, no. 189.<sup><xref rid="fn95">25</xref></sup> This also appears to be the view of R. Joseph Saul Nathanson, <italic>Teshuvot Sho&#x2019;el u-Meshiv</italic>, <italic>Mahadura Kamma</italic>, II, no. 136, s.v. <italic>u-mah she-katavta</italic>.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, both the Jew and the non-Jew rely upon Jewish law as governing the sale of <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> because the non-Jew recognizes that the Jewish party will abide by the agreement rather than commit a transgression. The non-Jew will not renege because the terms of the sale guarantee him a profit. But is this also the case with regard to a <italic>hetter iska</italic> in which one of the parties is a non-observant Jew who is unconcerned with the prohibition against usury and who may find it to his financial advantage to challenge the validity of the agreement in a civil court?</p>
<p>R. Moshe Schick, <italic>Teshuvot Maharam Shik, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 161, s.v. <italic>mihu</italic>, observes that, even if an attempt is made by the financier to bring an action in a civil court to demand that the document be construed as an ordinary interest-bearing loan, the recipient of the funds incurs no transgression. Nor, from the vantage point of Jewish law, has the financier transgressed the prohibition against accepting interest; the financier is an extortionist but not a recipient of interest.<sup><xref rid="fn96">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Yitzchak Ya&#x2019;akov Weisz, <italic>Teshuvot Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>, IV, no. 16, secs. 4, 7-8 and no. 18, sec. 4, questions the validity of a <italic>hetter iska</italic> whose provisions would not be enforced by a civil court in situations in which one or both of the parties would have no compunction with regard to having recourse to a civil court rather than to a <italic>bet din</italic>. His concern is that some individuals do not really intend to be bound by the provisions of the <italic>hetter iska</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn97">27</xref></sup> and hence a <italic>hetter iska</italic> that is not enforceable in a civil court does not constitute a valid agreement.<sup><xref rid="fn98">28</xref></sup> He does, however, suggest that this may not be a concern if it is only the recipient of the funds who is unconcerned with regard to the prohibition against bringing suit in a civil court. Since the provisions of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> are to the advantage of the recipient in providing for release from financial obligations upon adducing the stipulated proof of loss of capital and release from payment of a share of profits upon his oath that there was no profit, it is to his advantage to rely upon the <italic>hetter iska</italic> and hence there is no reason why he should not reach the requisite determination to be bound by its provisions. However, <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak&#x2019;</italic>s argument fails in a situation in which the stipulated return would constitute usury in civil law. In such an event, the recipient would certainly have a motive to seek to have a civil court invalidate the <italic>hetter iska</italic> because, in light of the usurious return stipulated by the parties, the debt would not be actionable in a civil court.</p>
<h1>IV. <italic>The</italic> Hetter Iska <italic>in American Law</italic></h1>
<p>As has been explained earlier, the <italic>hetter iska</italic> constitutes a device that is in full conformity with Jewish law. The <italic>hetter iska</italic> has also been recognized by the civil courts as an instrument creating a <italic>bona fide</italic> partnership interest providing for a limited return upon an investment rather than as a loan instrument requiring payment of interest on borrowed funds. In <italic>Leibovici</italic> v. <italic>Rawicki</italic>, 57 Misc.2d 141, 290 N.Y.S. 2d 997 (Civ. Ct. 1968), the Court upheld the legality of a <italic>hetter iska</italic> which provided a return greater than was permitted by usury laws in effect at that time. In this decision, the Court specifically denied the plea that the agreement was merely a disguised loan and hence constituted a subterfuge to avoid the taint of usury. In a number of cases, the courts have ruled explicitly that payment of a portion of profits in lieu of interest with no guarantee of profit is not usury.<sup><xref rid="fn99">29</xref></sup> In <italic>Leibovici</italic> v. <italic>Rawicki</italic> the Court recognized that a <italic>hetter iska</italic> constitutes an agreement of precisely this nature.</p>
<p>There are, nevertheless, cases in which American courts, primarily New York State courts, have refused to recognize a <italic>hetter iska</italic> as creating a partnership or joint venture. However, in each of those cases, either (a) the <italic>hetter iska</italic> issue was irrelevant; (b) the testimony presented to the court with regard to the nature of a <italic>hetter iska</italic> was patently incorrect; or (c) the <italic>hetter iska</italic> was improperly drafted. Those cases underscore the need to draft a <italic>hetter iska</italic> properly and, when testimony is required, to have knowledgeable scholars serve as expert witnesses.</p>
<p>One decision in particular has great relevance with regard to a type of <italic>hetter iska</italic> that has unjustifiably gained currency because of its simplicity. There appears to be a fairly widespread practice within some business circles to use a standard promissory note and to write the words &#x201C;<italic>al pi hetter iska</italic>&#x201D; (&#x201C;in accordance with <italic>hetter iska&#x201D;</italic>), or to use a rubber stamp bearing those words, above the signatures of the parties. The intent of that legend is to nullify explicit references in the instrument to a loan and interest by declaring actual intent to be a joint venture and shared profit. Read literally and in its entirety, the result is an ambiguity creating doubt with regard to the nature of the instrument and hence the expedient is of dubious efficacy in obviating the prohibition against interest.<sup><xref rid="fn100">30</xref></sup> Moreover, the term <italic>hetter iska</italic> is generic in nature and does not indicate which of the available forumulae or variations thereof is intended. In addition, a significant problem arises in the event that no profits are realized from investment of the funds received. Since there is no specific provision for an oath supporting a claim of the absence of profit, there is no basis for a fee in the form of accord and satisfaction in lieu of such an oath. Accordingly, if the transaction is governed by such a <italic>hetter iska</italic> and no profits have been realized, any sum paid the creditor in excess of principal in the absence of profit is, at best, a &#x201C;gift&#x201D; in return for the loan, which is itself a proscribed form of interest.</p>
<p>It is quite likely that the practice of using the formula &#x201C;<italic>al pi hetter iska</italic>&#x201D; evolved from an earlier-employed expedient that was not open to these challenges. In earlier times, printed promissory notes were not used. Instead the recipient wrote out a simple declaration in the nature of &#x201C;I acknowledge receipt of the sum of &#x005F;&#x005F;&#x005F;&#x005F;&#x005F;&#x005F;&#x005F; from &#x005F;&#x005F;&#x005F;&#x005F;&#x005F;&#x005F;&#x005F; in accordance with the <italic>hetter iska</italic> instituted by Maharam Avigdors of Cracow.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn101">31</xref></sup> The instrument (a) contained no contradictory reference to interest; and (b) provided both for profit-sharing and for payment in lieu of an oath by means of incorporation of the provisions of a particular well-known and published <italic>hetter iska</italic>, <italic>viz</italic>., the <italic>hetter iska</italic> authored by Maharam Avigdors. At times, the slightly shortened formula &#x201C;<italic>al pi hetter iska shel Maharam</italic>&#x201D; was used on the strength of the common recognition that the only &#x201C;Maharam&#x201D; associated with a <italic>hetter iska</italic> instrument is Maharam Avigdors. Use of the formula &#x201C;<italic>al pi hetter iska shel Maharam&#x201D;</italic> when the intention is half loan, half deposit is clearly inappropriate.<sup><xref rid="fn102">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>A New York trial court found the abbreviated formula to be ambiguous and ordered a trial to determine, <italic>inter alia</italic>, the nature of the instrument. In <italic>Arnav Industries</italic>, <italic>Inc.</italic> v. <italic>Westside Realty Assoc</italic>., 180 A.D.2d 463, 579 N.Y.S.2d 382 (1<sup>st</sup> Dep&#x2019;t 1992), the Appellate Division found that inclusion of the phrase did not generate a threshold level of ambiguity sufficient to warrant denial of summary judgment on the promissory note. The promissory note that was the subject of dispute in <italic>Arnav</italic> contained a clause specifically stating that &#x201C;[n]othing herein or in Mortgage is intended to create a joint venture, partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower and Lender.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn103">33</xref></sup> That clause constitutes an explicit rejection of the relationship a <italic>hetter iska</italic> is designed to create. Absent that clause, the issue of whether references to a loan and to payment of interest are rendered ambiguous by insertion of the phrase &#x201C;<italic>al pi hetter iska</italic>&#x201D; remains an open legal question. Nor, if an ambiguity is found to exist, is there any way to predict how a trial court might resolve that ambiguity.</p>
<p>The decision in <italic>Arnav</italic> should serve as a caution against use of an abbreviated <italic>hetter iska</italic> consisting of but a vague and ambiguous phrase. Since that procedure is in any event of dubious halakhic validity, the decision in <italic>Arnav</italic> places no significant burden upon utilization of a <italic>hetter iska</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Barclay Commerce Corp.</italic> v. <italic>Abraham Finkelstein</italic>, 11 A.D.2d 327, 205 N.Y.S.2d 551 (1<sup>st</sup> Dep&#x2019;t 1960) involved a case in which the plaintiff and the corporate defendant entered into a factoring agreement guaranteeing payment of monies which might become due. The suit was based upon the plaintiff&#x2019;s contention that the accounts receivable that had been assigned were fraudulent. The Appellate Court found that since the alleged fraud was not denied, the question of whether or not the <italic>hetter iska</italic> created a partnership was a &#x201C;phantom&#x201D; issue.<sup><xref rid="fn104">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>In <italic>Bollag</italic> v. <italic>Dresdner</italic>, 130 Misc.2d 221, 495 N.Y.S.2d 560 (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 1985), the parties entered into a properly drafted <italic>hetter iska</italic>. The defendant maintained that (a) the contract was void as usurious; and (b) the transaction constituted an investment by the plaintiff subject to any profits earned or losses sustained. The plaintiff relied upon the <italic>hetter iska</italic> in countering the usury defense but also incongruously alleged that he was entitled to repayment of principal and interest regardless of any profit or loss. Further muddying the waters, the plaintiff&#x2019;s complaint and bill of particulars categorized the instrument as a note and presented an expert witness who testified imprecisely that such forms are employed &#x201C;when one party is lending money and the other party is borrowing money.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn105">35</xref></sup> The Court also noted discrepancies between the <italic>hetter iska</italic> and testimony regarding liability in the event of absence of profit or of loss of capital. Most damaging was the unequivocal, but patently false, testimony of the expert who &#x201C;testified emphatically&#x2026;that the agreement did not create a joint venture or partnership.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn106">36</xref></sup> Not only is that statement false, it is absurd, since, if true, it would render the <italic>hetter iska</italic> devoid of purpose. The Court took note of the inherent contradiction in the plaintiff&#x2019;s position in observing, &#x201C;Yet despite his repeated use of the above-quoted categorization of the transaction, it is &#x2018;done,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;specifically not to pay interest.&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn107">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Court, in this decision, expressly affirmed in principle the validity of a properly drafted <italic>hetter iska</italic> in finding that the <italic>hetter iska</italic> presented to the court &#x201C;as interpreted by the parties and their witnesses at trial reveals that the transaction was a loan (not an &#x2018;investment&#x2019;) and that plaintiff&#x2019;s clear intent was to exact a higher rate of interest than is permitted by law.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn108">38</xref></sup> The Court distinguished the case before it from <italic>Leibovici</italic> v. <italic>Rawicki</italic> on the grounds that in <italic>Leibovici</italic> &#x201C;the funds were clearly treated as a joint investment.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn109">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>In <italic>Bollag</italic>, the Court found that the defendant requested the loan that was the subject of litigation for business purposes rather than for personal needs. Accordingly, it found that the policy and reasoning behind the general obligation law &#x00A7;5-521 serve to disallow a usury defense in such circumstances. In doing so, the Court affirmed the <italic>hetter iska</italic> as a valid business contract. However, incongruously, and perhaps cynically, its disallowance of the usury defense notwithstanding, the Court refused to allow &#x201C;interest.&#x201D; The Court found that the plaintiff was prevented from collecting interest by his own pleading. The plaintiff had maintained that the <italic>hetter iska</italic> was entered into specifically to avoid payment of interest. Yet, the plaintiff&#x2019;s own expert witness incorrectly categorized the claim as one to recover &#x201C;interest.&#x201D; Giving equal credence to both the plaintiff&#x2019;s own statement and the testimony of plaintiff&#x2019;s expert witness the Court declared, &#x201C;[P]laintiff has made it plain he neither wishes to nor can collect interest. Accordingly, none shall be awarded.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn110">40</xref></sup> The defendant, in effect, was hung from his own petard.</p>
<p>Although recovery of accrued interest was denied, the Court allowed interest on the judgment at the statutory rate from the date of its entry on the grounds that there was &#x201C;no testimony which would bar plaintiff from receiving interest on a judgment (as distinct from interest on a loan).&#x201D; That finding reflects an erroneous assessment of Jewish law. Recovery of interest on a judgment is indeed precluded by Jewish law. Absence of testimony to that effect is but one more example of the comedy of errors and incompetence on the part of counsel and witnesses reflected in this case.</p>
<p>In an unreported case, <italic>Berger</italic> v. <italic>Moskowitz</italic>, N.Y.L.J 25, (col. 3), vol. 206, no. 85 (October 30, 1991), 25 the Court found that a perfunctory <italic>hetter iska</italic> did not succeed in establishing a partnership agreement because it failed &#x201C;to identify the nature of the venture let alone the specifics relating to the terms of such venture.&#x201D; The <italic>hetter iska</italic> in question was titled &#x201C;Business Agreement&#x201D; and did recite that the sum in question was advanced &#x201C;for business and the profit of which agreed on will be ten percent, and the duration [of] the business will be three years from the signing of this agreement.&#x201D; Although inelegantly drafted, the agreement itself would seem to this writer to reflect the intent of the parties that the funds be applied to a business venture and that the 10&#x0025; be paid out of profits, the implication being that such profit-sharing was predicated upon actual realization of profits. However, in this case also, the defendant was found liable by virtue of his own admission. The Court declared, &#x201C;Nor can defendants label this transaction a business venture since MOSKOWITZ wrote a letter to the plaintiffs&#x2019; attorney stating in part: &#x2018;I acknowledge that the unpaid balance of the loan with interest through November 30, 1990, is &#x0024;268,200.00.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>The decision of a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in <italic>In re Stephen Douglas</italic>, 174 B.R. 16 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 1994), does not involve any substantive matter pertaining to the legal validity of a <italic>hetter iska.</italic> The issue was whether a certain payment constituted a fraudulent conveyance under applicable statutes. Section 273 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law denominates as fraudulent any conveyance made by an insolvent for inadequate consideration, without regard to actual intent. The books and records of the debtors reflected no consideration or economic benefit conferred upon Douglas by the defendant. It was also alleged that a promissory note reflecting a loan was executed but was lost. A <italic>hetter iska</italic> was introduced in evidence in support of existence of a loan. That evidence was dismissed on the grounds that it was written on the stationery of a corporation not involved in the proceedings. Since the <italic>hetter iska</italic> was dismissed as irrelevant, the Court found that there was no need to address the legal import of a <italic>hetter iska.</italic></p>
<p><italic>Heimbinder</italic> v. <italic>Berkovitz</italic>, 175 Misc.2d 808, 670 N.Y.S.2d 301 (N.Y.Sup. 1998), involved an action to invalidate various transfers to the defendant corporation which would have otherwise been available to satisfy a judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff sought to hold defendant directors personally liable for breach of fiduciary duty in effecting such transfers. Since a <italic>hetter iska</italic> was employed, the plaintiff also contended that the defendant, in signing the document, personally guaranteed payment of the obligation. The court cited with approval an earlier unpublished decision in <italic>Burger</italic> v. <italic>Baruch Ha&#x2019;Levi Moskowitz</italic>, Kings County Sup.Ct., Index NO. 15600/91, in which a <italic>hetter iska</italic> constituted the sole contract between two individual parties and was found to establish a valid guarantee. In <italic>Heimbinder</italic>, however, the evidence indicated that plaintiff&#x2019;s attorney had previously requested a personal guarantee and that the request had been refused by the defendant&#x2019;s attorney. Moreover the &#x201C;security agreement&#x201D; executed by the parties contained a provision for a &#x201C;guarantee&#x201D; next to which the word &#x201C;omit&#x201D; was entered in handwriting; the defendant&#x2019;s name had been typed beneath the signature line for the guarantor but was crossed out. The plaintiff conceded that there had been a discussion of guarantees but that no agreement was reached; that he had been unaware of the existence of a guarantee provision in the form that was used and that the <italic>hetter iska</italic> was produced by the defendant only after discussions in which he refused a personal guarantee had been concluded; that he could not read Hebrew and relied upon the defendant&#x2019;s categorization of the document; and that the defendant did not portray it as a personal guarantee. Accordingly, the Court found that, in the case before it, the <italic>hetter iska</italic> was not intended to generate a personal guarantee of corporate debt. Nothing in the <italic>Heimbinder</italic> decision casts doubt upon the enforceability of the provisions of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> itself.</p>
<p><italic>Heimbinder</italic>, however, serves to establish a significant point of law. A standard <italic>hetter iska</italic> signed by an officer of a corporation in circumstances other that those of <italic>Heimbinder</italic> may well establish a personal obligation even absent explicit indication of such intention. If this is not the desired outcome, the remedy is to indicate explicitly in the document that it is being executed on behalf of the corporation and not in an individual capacity.</p>
<p><italic>Wiesel</italic> v<italic>. Rubinstein</italic>, 12 Misc.3d 1168(A) (N.Y.Sup. 2006), represents a foregone opportunity to seek application of a collateral provision of a <italic>hetter iska</italic>. Kalman Rubinstein signed a series of promissory notes in order to obtain funds to open a kosher pizza shop. The rate of return on each of the notes, most of which were short term in nature, was 14&#x0025;. Despite an agreement to submit the dispute to a <italic>bet din</italic> for resolution, Rubinstein failed to appear before the <italic>bet din</italic> to which the parties agreed. The <italic>bet din</italic> declined to issue a default judgment. Thereupon, the estates of Sol and Harriet Wiesel sued in New York State Supreme Court. Apparently, the plaintiff made no attempt to have the Supreme Court enforce compliance with the arbitration agreement or to issue a default judgment upon failure to submit to arbitration despite the express agreement between the parties to do so that was incorporated in the <italic>hetter iska</italic>.</p>
<p>Rubinstein seems to have been under the impression that he would prevail in a civil court both because the plaintiffs&#x2019; claim was barred by the statute of limitations and because the rate of interest was usurious. Nevertheless, he asserted an additional affirmative defense, <italic>viz</italic>., since &#x201C;each of the notes contains a notation in Hebrew indicating the notes are subject to <italic>hetter iska</italic> failure of the business absolved him of the obligation to repay the amounts due on the notes.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn111">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Court denied summary judgment based on the statute of limitations on the grounds that the alleged partial payment of the debt had the effect of extending the period within which a suit might be initiated. The Court also interpreted the note as prescribing 14&#x0025; per annum rather than a usurious 14&#x0025; for a much briefer period. The <italic>hetter iska</italic> defense was ignored in the Court&#x2019;s rejection of the motion for summary judgment, perhaps because it was self-evident that whether or not the business did fail, and whether or not a <italic>hetter iska</italic> provides that such failure cancels the obligation, are triable issues.</p>
<p>In point of fact, a standard <italic>hetter iska</italic> would require a solemn oath to substantiate a claim of non-realization of profit and testimony of two halakhically qualified witnesses to establish loss of capital. In this case, an ordinary promissory note seems to have been employed but modified by inclusion of a &#x201C;notation in Hebrew indicating that the notes are subject to the <italic>hetter iska.</italic>&#x201D; That &#x201C;notation&#x201D; was the incorporation of the earlier-discussed phrase &#x201C;<italic>al pi hetter iska.</italic>&#x201D; As noted earlier, that phrase may signify only that the term &#x201C;loan&#x201D; should be understood as &#x201C;investment&#x201D; and that the term &#x201C;interest&#x201D; should not be construed as such but as the return of a share of the profits earned by the investment. If so, as discussed earlier, entirely different and much less onerous standards of proof might apply to establishing absence of profit and loss of capital. Whether or not &#x201C;failure of the business&#x201D; did indeed absolve the defendant &#x201C;of the obligation to repay the amounts due on the notes&#x201D; is a matter to be resolved by a <italic>bet din</italic>.</p>
<p>The above notwithstanding, in a Report and Recommendation on Motion to Dismiss in the case of <italic>Edelkind</italic> v<italic>. Fairmont Funding,</italic> 539 F.Supp.2d 449 (D. Mass. 2008), a federal magistrate asserted that in civil courts &#x201C;<italic>hetter iska</italic> agreements have been interpreted as &#x2018;merely a compliance in form with Hebraic law&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn112">42</xref></sup> that does not create a partnership between the parties.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn113">43</xref></sup> In support of that assertion, the Magistrate cited <italic>Arnav Indus. v. Westside Realty Assoc</italic>., <italic>Barclay Commerce Corp</italic>. and <italic>Heimbinder</italic>. As has been shown, those cases do not serve to establish the Magistrate&#x2019;s conclusion. Quite to the contrary, each of those cases reflects acceptance of the validity of a properly drafted <italic>hetter iska</italic> in creating a partnership between the parties but finds the particular <italic>hetter iska</italic> instruments submitted in those proceedings to be faulty. The <italic>hetter iska</italic> employed in <italic>Edelkind</italic> may also have been defective but that issue was not addressed. These cases serve to underscore the necessity for careful drafting of a halakhically valid <italic>hetter iska</italic> agreement. A sample text of an English-language <italic>hetter iska</italic> agreement may be found in this writer&#x2019;s <italic>Contemporary Halakhic Problems</italic>, II (New York, 1983), 386-388.</p>
<p>The claim advanced in <italic>Edelkind</italic> was dismissed because Jamie Edelkind was found to have no standing to bring a suit as an alleged third party beneficiary of a mortgage agreement entered into by his wife. The findings with regard to the <italic>hetter iska</italic>, also apparently signed by the wife, constitute dicta having no bearing upon the merits of the case. Nevertheless, the facts presented in <italic>Edelkind</italic> underscore a serious pitfall based, not upon the validity of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> itself, but upon the way it was employed.</p>
<p>It is quite common for a lender to execute a <italic>hetter iska</italic> and immediately thereafter to execute a second, standard mortgage agreement. It is commonly assumed that the lender is better protected legally if he is in possession of a mortgage instrument. Whether or not that is true, there is no gainsaying the fact that the lender feels more secure with a mortgage in his possession. R. Moshe Feinstein, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic>, no. 62, sanctions the practice from the perspective of Jewish law in describing the mortgage instrument as devoid of halakhic validity provided that the <italic>iska</italic> agreement states that it is the governing instrument and the mortgage is designed merely as &#x201C;<italic>bit&#x1E25;onot</italic>,&#x201D; best translated as &#x201C;reliances&#x201D; or &#x201C;assurances.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn114">44</xref></sup> Nevertheless, one legal ramification of such practice is evident in <italic>Edelkind</italic>.</p>
<p>In instances such as those described in <italic>Edelkind</italic>, the mortgage agreement is crucial to the enterprise. Fairmont Funding is a mortgage broker. The principals are observant Jews. The firm enters into mortgage agreements in conjunction with the purchase of real property and then sells the mortgage loans to banks. Therein lies the dilemma: The mortgage broker is the lender, both halakhically and legally; the mortgage broker contracts for interest to be paid to himself. This, as an observant Jew, he may not do. Therefore, he avails himself of a <italic>hetter iska</italic>. The mortgage bankers are non-Jews; they do not understand, and would not purchase, a <italic>hetter iska</italic>. Therefore, the mortgage broker, in addition to a <italic>hetter iska</italic>, insists upon a mortgage note which he then sells to the mortgage bank, presumably without informing the bank of the existence of the <italic>hetter iska</italic>.</p>
<p>That was precisely the chain of events reported in <italic>Edelkind v. Fairmont</italic>. The contemplated procedure was recited in detail in the preamble to the <italic>hetter iska</italic> agreement. Jamie Edelkind argued that the <italic>hetter iska</italic> created a partnership in the mortgaged property and, accordingly, Fairmont Funding was not empowered to sell the purported loan without permission or notification of his wife who was thereby denied her option to repurchase Fairmont&#x2019;s investment. Edelkind categorized the mortgage document as a &#x201C;fiction&#x201D; and accordingly contended that neither Fairmont nor any subsequent holder of the instrument had any legal rights in the mortgage. Hence, he argued, Fairmont and his wife still own the property jointly as partners and neither Fairmont nor any subsequent holder had any foreclosure rights.</p>
<p>There is merit in Jamie Edelkind&#x2019;s contention but, if so, both he and Fairmont perpetrated a fraud upon subsequent holders of the mortgage. The obvious remedy is to insert a clause in the <italic>hetter iska</italic> agreement authorizing the mortgage broker to mortgage the entire property.<sup><xref rid="fn115">45</xref></sup> Indeed, a careful reading of the preamble to the <italic>hetter iska</italic> agreement between Edelkind and Fairmont Funding reveals that this was agreed to by the parties. Clearer language would have prevented Jamie Edelkind from arguing otherwise. In any event, suppression of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> agreement gives rise to an aura of fraud and should not be countenanced. In addition, authorization to assign a mortgage against the entire property should be carefully spelled out in the body of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> agreement.<sup><xref rid="fn116">46</xref></sup></p>
<h1>V. <italic>Assuring The Validity of a</italic> Hetter Iska</h1>
<p>It seems to this writer that, even according to the authorities who maintain that a <italic>hetter iska</italic> must be enforceable in a civil court, a contract containing an enforceable clause requiring arbitration before a <italic>bet din</italic> is sufficient. The position of those authorities is based on the contention that a contract requires a meeting of minds. Hence, if one or the other of the parties regards the agreement as a charade, the <italic>hetter iska</italic> is of no effect. Awareness that the provisions of that instrument are not civilly enforceable, they contend, has the effect of thwarting such a meeting of minds. However, whether the provisions are directly enforceable under applicable civil law or are enforceable only by virtue of an arbitration clause is of no material significance in this regard. So long as both parties recognize that the provisions of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> will be enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction, whether directly or by means of confirmation of an arbitration award, there must be seriousness of intent to abide by the provisions of a <italic>hetter iska</italic>.</p>
<p>There is, of course, the possibility that, for one reason or another, one of the parties may prove to be recalcitrant and refuse to appear before a <italic>bet din</italic> or that, as occurred in <italic>Wiesel</italic>, the <italic>bet din</italic> may decline to issue an award and grant leave to have recourse to a secular court. In such instances, it may be to the advantage of the person bringing a cause of action to have the court treat the instrument as an ordinary loan.</p>
<p>Since the parties have bound themselves to enforceable arbitration before a <italic>bet din</italic>, and hence at the time of the execution of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> there is a proper meeting of minds, the manner in which the instrument is construed by a civil court in cases of default is of no halakhic significance. The validity of that conclusion is evidenced both by <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>&#x2019;s ruling that an interest-bearing loan agreement may be presented to a civil court if there is default on the underlying <italic>hetter iska</italic>, and by the ruling of <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> that a conventional mortgage may be executed for purposes of &#x201C;<italic>bit&#x1E25;onot</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Accordingly, this writer recommends that a <italic>hetter iska</italic> agreement incorporate two separate clauses: (a) a clause providing for binding arbitration before a <italic>bet din</italic>; and (b) a clause providing that if, for any reason, the transaction governed by the <italic>hetter iska</italic> becomes the subject of litigation before a civil court, it is the intent of the parties that the court construe the transaction as an ordinary loan and enforce it as such. In this writer&#x2019;s opinion, the coupling of those two clauses renders the arrangement acceptable according to all authorities. The following text may be used to achieve that effect:<sup><xref rid="fn117">47</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">In the event of any controversy arising out of, or related to, this agreement the same shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with Jewish law by a tripartite panel of qualified rabbis versed in such law.<sup><xref rid="fn118">48</xref></sup> Each party shall be entitled to appoint one member of this panel; the two members appointed in this manner shall appoint the third member of the panel. The award by a majority of such panel shall be confirmed in any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the CPLR without any right of appeal therefrom. An action shall be brought before a civil court only in the event of failure of one of the parties to appear before a rabbinic tribunal and only upon leave from a rabbinic tribunal.</p>
<p>This undertaking shall be governed solely by the stipulations contained in this agreement. Any further documents pertaining to this transaction bearing the signatures of the undersigned is hereby declared null and void insofar as Jewish law is concerned. Any such document is to be construed solely as an expedient designed to provide relief in a civil court in accordance with usual judicial procedures in the event of the undersigned&#x2019;s failure to appear before a rabbinic tribunal or failure to abide by the decision of that tribunal. Accordingly, it is expressly acknowledged that, in the event of recourse to a civil court by the undersigned or by any other party, the claims and privileges of the undersigned arising from any other document or from any other source are in no way to be diminished or compromised by virtue of this agreement.<sup><xref rid="fn119">49</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote>The objection voiced by R.

<ftnote id="fn76">6. R. Baruch ha-Levi Epstein, <italic>Torah Temimah</italic>, Leviticus 25:36, sec. 192, defends the introduction of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> during the medieval period:</ftnote>
<p align="blockquote">At the time the Torah was given, the basis of livelihood and commerce of Jews was agrarian; agriculture was the source and support of their wealth and status for he who had copious produce was considered a rich man. Money was not fundamental or the basis of their activities; and when money was loaned it was not for the purpose of trade and acquisition, but in order to acquire bread and clothing by a person who could not afford such from the yield of his land and work. Accordingly, it is obvious that this poor debtor could not afford to pay interest, while the wealthy lender would suffer no perceivable loss in lending without interest&#x2026;.However, in the Middle Ages, by which time Israel had lost its share and inheritance in working the land and become a nation that sustained itself solely on commerce, the prohibition became onerous, for by then money had become the basis of [the Jews&#x2019;] life and commerce; it became a business commodity to the lender and to the borrower equally. &#x201C;That your brother may live with you&#x201D; applied to both equally. Therefore, our sages saw fit to find a permissive manner to avoid this prohibition considering that, for such purpose, the Torah did not entirely forbid this matter.</p>
<ftnote id="fn77">7. One way to avoid the problem is to structure the half-loan, half-deposit so that, although profits are shared equally, the recipient is to bear maximum loss of only one third of the capital. In effect, the difference between one half and one third is &#x201C;insured&#x201D; by the financier in return for the services performed by the recipient. That arrangement renders performance of personal services as payment in lieu of a &#x201C;premium&#x201D; that might ordinarily be required to insure against loss of the difference between one third and one half of the investment. See the <italic>hetter iska</italic> of R. Abraham Brode published in <italic>Noheg ke-&#x1E92;on Yosef, masa u-matan</italic>, sec. 4. Cf., R. Ya&#x2019;akov Yeshaye Blau, <italic>Brit Yehudah</italic> 37:4, 40:6, note 12 and 40:1, note 9. This expedient is employed in the <italic>hetter iska</italic> used by Israeli banks.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn87">17. A similar rationale is invoked by R.

Apparently, the concern was with regard to the sale or lease of real property in which the <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> was located. See his <italic>Mo&#x2019;adim u-Zemanim</italic>, III, no. 269, note 1, s.v. <italic>amnam</italic>, where Rabbi Sternbuch makes a similar point regarding subleasing the places in which <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> is stored in situations in which the lessee is not entitled to sublet.

In such cases, in a sale <italic>mipnei ra&#x2019;atah</italic>, there is reliance upon the deed alone. <italic>Maharit</italic> contends that in a locale in which a deed is customarily executed there is no reliance upon payment of cash alone since there is no proof of sale. The issue discussed by <italic>Be&#x2019;er Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> is the sale of <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> to a non-Jew on the eve of Passover without a valid written conveyance. The question is, since the sale is <italic>ma&#x1E25;mat ra&#x2019;atah</italic>, can payment of cash be relied upon as a mode of conveyance? <italic>Be&#x2019;er Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> rebuts <italic>Maharit</italic>&#x2019;s view on the basis of statements of <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</italic>, I, no. 1, 226 and <italic>Teshuvot R.

<ftnote id="fn116">46. There is an additional vague reference to <italic>hetter iska</italic> in a decision of a federal appeals court, <italic>Barclays Discount Bank, Ltd</italic>. v. <italic>Bogharian Bros.,</italic> 743 F.2d 722, 724 (9<sup>th</sup> Cir.

The manifold provisions contained in that form may be incorporated by reference and made an integral part of any loan agreement. A standard loan form may be used provided that the words &#x201C;loan&#x201D; and &#x201C;interest&#x201D; are eliminated wherever they may occur and the words &#x201C;funds&#x201D; and &#x201C;premium&#x201D; are substituted in their stead and provided that the following clause is inserted:</ftnote>
<p align="blockquote">The parties to this agreement desire to comply fully with the provisions of Jewish law prohibiting payment and acceptance of interest and for this purpose agree that the terms of this agreement shall be made subject to the terms of <italic>Hetter Iska</italic> as provided in the form set forth in <italic>Contemporary Halakhic Problems</italic>, IV (New York, 1995), pp. 380-383. All provisions of said <italic>Hetter Iska</italic> form shall be incorporated and made part of this agreement as is fully set forth herein.</p>
<ftnote id="fn118">48. The arbitration clause should clearly state that arbitration before a <italic>bet din</italic> is a condition precedent to any action before a civil court. In the most recent case involving a <italic>hetter iska</italic> agreement, <italic>Koenig v. Middlebury Land Associates</italic>, LLC, 16 Conn. L. Rptr. 90 (Conn. Sup. Ct. 2008), the issue was not whether the transaction was a loan or a joint business venture, but whether an arbitration clause in the <italic>hetter iska</italic> directing that disputes be heard by a <italic>bet din</italic> deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court held that the language of the arbitration clause of the <italic>hetter iska</italic> did not expressly provide or necessarily imply that arbitration before a <italic>bet din</italic> was a condition precedent to any court action and denied the defendant&#x2019;s motion to dismiss.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn119">49. One reason for inserting such a clause is the possible effect upon third parties who are not themselves parties to the <italic>hetter iska</italic>. A problem of that nature arose some time ago in <italic>First International Bank, Ltd.</italic> v. <italic>L. Blankstein &#x0026; Son, Inc.</italic>, 88 A.D.2d, 501, 449 N.Y.S.2d 737 (1<sup>st</sup> Dep&#x2019;t 1983), aff&#x2019;d, 59 N.Y.2d 436 (N.Y. 1983). That case involved an Israeli diamond merchant sued by an Israeli bank in a New York court because he failed to honor a promissory note. In a suit filed in New York State Supreme Court it was alleged that the practice in Israeli diamond circles permits return of gems to the wholesaler for any reason or for no reason. A similar issue was presented in <italic>Israel Discount Bank Ltd</italic>. v. <italic>Rappaport</italic>, 90 A.D.2d 740, 456 N.Y.S.2d 988 (1<sup>st</sup> Dep&#x2019;t 1982). In Israel, diamonds are typically purchased on the strength of a promissory note. That practice is described in another case, <italic>Barclays Discount Bank Ltd</italic>. v. <italic>Levy</italic>, 743 F.2d 722 (9<sup>th</sup> Cir. Cal. 1984), involving Siegman as a diamond dealer but in which he was not a party. When the market for diamonds fell dramatically in the early 1980&#x2019;s, Leo Siegman, recognizing that he could not realize a profit from the resale of diamonds that he had purchased, returned the diamonds to the seller. He contended that in doing so he voided the promissory note. However, in the interim, the seller had discounted the promissory note by presenting it to the Israeli bank. Executory agreements that allow for cancellation of a debt are not binding on an assignee unless the assignee has prior notice of such an agreement. The bank argued that, as an assignee, it was not bound by any executory agreement between Siegman and the seller and, accordingly, sued to collect the debt represented by the promissory note. The facts in <italic>First International Bank</italic> v. <italic>Siegman</italic> were similar to those before the Court in <italic>Barclays</italic> v. <italic>Levy</italic>. In <italic>First International Bank</italic> v. <italic>Siegman</italic>, Siegman was in a position to counter that all arrangements between Israeli banks and their clients are governed by a <italic>hetter iska</italic> and that the <italic>hetter iska</italic> creates a partnership between the bank and the party to whom it advances funds in return for assignment of the debt represented by the <italic>hetter iska</italic>. The Uniform Partnership Act &#x00A7; 12 provides that notice to one partner is tantamount to notice to all partners. See Alan R. Bromberg, <italic>Crane and Bromberg on Partnership</italic> (St. Paul, 1968), p. 322 and p. 322, note 73. Since the bank had effective notice of the agreement permitting cancellation of the debt upon return of the diamonds through notice to its partner, i.e., the seller, Siegman might have argued he was relieved of liability to the bank as well.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Although the <italic>hetter iska</italic> was not raised as a consideration in <italic>First International Bank</italic>, nevertheless, that case serves to underscore the fact that complications affecting third parties may arise as the result of a <italic>hetter iska</italic> arrangement. A clause in the nature here proposed would result in the court considering the <italic>hetter iska</italic> as a conventional loan agreement with regard to any suit brought by a third party.</ftnote>

<p align="blockquote">JUDAH HALEVI<sup><xref rid="fn120">1</xref></sup></p>
<h1>I. <italic>Introduction</italic></h1>
<p>Common law categorizes efficacious treatment carried out without consent of the patient, not as malpractice, but as simple battery. Unlike common law which regards any intentional non-consensual tactile contact with another person as a tort, Halakhah does not regard therapeutic &#x201C;wounding&#x201D; (<italic>&#x1E25;avalah</italic>) as a tortious battery. Jewish law does not accept the notion that lack of consent renders medical intervention tortious and certainly provides no basis for monetary recovery unless there is resultant physical harm. But, when the physician does cause damage, it would seem at least as a first impression, that the usual rules governing battery are applicable. Thus, in principle, Jewish law regards malpractice, not as an independent tort, but as a form of <italic>&#x1E25;avalah</italic> or battery.</p>
<p>In general, Jewish law assigns to the tortfeasor absolute liability for harm to person or property arising from his or her physical act. The connotation of the talmudic principle formulated by the Gemara, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 26b, &#x201C;<italic>Adam mu&#x2019;ad le-olam</italic>&#x201D; (&#x201C;Man is always forewarned&#x201D;) is that a person is always liable for damage resulting from an act committed by his body. It would then follow that a physician whose treatment results in harm to the patient should be liable for compensation even if the harm is the result of misadventure rather than negligence.<sup><xref rid="fn121">2</xref></sup> Nevertheless, in point of fact, Jewish law does not hold the physician liable in any sense unless he has been negligent in his treatment. The reason or reasons for treating malpractice differently from ordinary forms of <italic>adam ha-mazik</italic> (lit.: man as tortfeasor) require elucidation. Moreover, the definition or delineation of culpable negligence as applied to medical malpractice is problematic.</p>
<p>The task of determining with precision the circumstances in which a physician will be held culpable is made difficult by the fact that the talmudic sources are sparse and cryptic. Moreover, early-day commentaries and codifiers offer little further clarification; quite to the contrary, their comments present further difficulties. In addition, at least until the contemporary period, the topic has, relatively speaking, received but scant attention in the writings of latter-day authorities.</p>
<p>One can but speculate with regard to the relative paucity of material devoted to this issue. It may well have been the case that during the medieval period, when in some countries Jewish medical practitioners were common, modalities of treatment were quite limited with the result that demonstrable malpractice was much rarer than at present. In later times, with the exception of observant physicians of German extraction, the religious commitment of most Jews who entered the medical profession was generally quite tenuous rendering it unlikely that such a physician would heed the summons of a <italic>bet din</italic> or feel himself bound by the provisions of Jewish law.</p>
<p>At present, although the Jewish community is graced by a sizeable and growing number of observant physicians, adjudication of a malpractice suit by a <italic>bet din</italic> is a rarity for the simple reason that, at present, all physicians are covered by malpractice insurance. Insurance companies are publicly held corporations and are hardly likely to avail themselves of the services of a <italic>bet din</italic>. Elsewhere,<sup><xref rid="fn122">3</xref></sup> this writer has expressed the opinion that a Jew may properly sue a fellow Jew in a secular court provided that he does not accept a recovery greater than the insurance coverage. Although, technically, it is the insured who is the named defendant, the actual party interest is, and is commonly known to be, the insurance company. Hence, since the real party in interest is not Jewish, the prohibition against recourse to civil courts is not operative.<sup><xref rid="fn123">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recovery from an insurance company, in this writer&#x2019;s opinion, is appropriate even in instances in which such recovery would not be available in a <italic>bet din</italic> or in which the sum awarded is greater than would be allowed by a <italic>bet din</italic>. That is so even if, as a matter of Jewish law, the Jewish plaintiff cannot directly claim that, in an action against a non-Jew, the appropriate measure of damages is the enhanced standard adopted by the civil legal system.<sup><xref rid="fn124">5</xref></sup> The insurance company is liable in contract rather than in tort. The claimant is a third party beneficiary of that contract. The contractual obligation is to indemnify the policyholder or the victim to the extent that a civil court would award damages against the insured. Thus, whether or not Jewish law would make a similar award for tort damages is rendered irrelevant. The insurance company has contracted to indemnify its insured in that amount simply because, in fact, it has been, or would have been, awarded by the court.</p>
<p>Parenthetically, the question of whether a contract of that nature is invalid by reason of <italic>asmakhta</italic>, i.e., lack of anticipation that the circumstances necessitating performance would actually arise, is a moot point.<sup><xref rid="fn125">6</xref></sup> Any insurance company that might choose to deny an otherwise valid claim on the plea that the insurance policy serving as the basis of the claim is unenforceable by reason of <italic>asmakhta</italic> would not long remain in business. No rational policyholder would continue to pay a premium for coverage once he has discovered that the insurer will not honor any legitimate claim.<sup><xref rid="fn126">7</xref></sup></p>
<h1>II. <italic>Early Sources</italic></h1>
<h3>1. <italic>The Tosefta</italic></h3>
<p>The principles governing financial liability for malpractice are closely tied to the principles governing punishment for inadvertent manslaughter applicable in situations in which malpractice leads to death. Jewish law denies recovery of damages for wrongful death regardless of whether the death results from an act of homicide, negligent manslaughter or misadventure. Under certain carefully defined circumstances Jewish law prescribes exile to one of the designated cities of refuge as punishment for negligent manslaughter. Exile was imposed only during the historical period in which there was an incumbent High Priest and in which capital punishment might be imposed for willful acts.<sup><xref rid="fn127">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In limiting the circumstances in which exile was required the Mishnah, <italic>Makkot</italic> 8a, states:</p>
<p align="blockquote">If [a person] throws a stone into his courtyard and slays: if the victim had permission to enter therein [the slayer] goes into exile; but if not, he does not go into exile, as it is written &#x201C;and when a person goes with his friend into a forest&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 19:5)&#x2014;just as a forest [both] the victim and the slayer are permitted therein, similarly [the law applies] in every domain in which [both] the victim and the slayer are entitled to enter, to the exclusion of the courtyard of the householder since the victim does not have the right to enter therein. Abba Saul says: Just as the cutting of wood is a discretionary act, similarly [the law applies] in all instances of discretionary acts, to the exclusion of a father who beats his son, a teacher who strikes his pupil and a messenger of the court [who administers lashes].<sup><xref rid="fn128">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Abba Saul&#x2019;s distinction is quite easy to grasp. The paradigm presented in Scripture involves accidental death resulting from an attempt to fell a tree in a forest. Such activity is entirely discretionary; the slayer was perfectly free to refrain from wood-chopping. Had he done so, no misadventure would have occurred. Since he was under no legal or moral duty to engage in that activity, he is held to a relatively high standard of prudence. A father who punishes his son, a teacher who chastises a pupil and the court official who administers punishment to a miscreant are all engaged in discharging a duty. Since they are duty-bound to perform such acts they are not punished even in cases of avoidable misadventure.</p>
<p>The Tosefta, <italic>Makkot</italic>, addenda 2:5, presents a rather different rule:</p>
<p align="blockquote">A messenger of the court who administers lashes with permission of the court goes into exile [if the victim dies]. A skilled physician who heals with license of the court and kills [his patient] goes into exile. One who performs an embryotomy [upon a fetus] in the woman&#x2019;s womb with license of the court and kills [the mother] goes into exile.<sup><xref rid="fn129">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rule formulated by the Tosefta seems to be at variance from the rule presented in the Mishnah in the name of Abba Saul. Abba Saul formulates the principle that a person who causes the death of another in the course of performing a duty is exempt from exile. The examples presented by the Tosefta, <italic>viz.</italic>, a messenger of the court and a physician, seem similarly to be instances of persons engaged in discharging a duty and, in accordance with the rule formulated by Abba Saul, such persons should not be subject to exile.</p>
<p>R. Meir Simchah of Dvinsk, <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic>, <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 5:6, suggests that the Tosefta expresses a view that is in disagreement with Abba Saul. Indeed, as recorded by the Gemara, <italic>Makkot</italic> 8a, in presenting his principle, Abba Saul appears to be disagreeing with the anonymous, and hence presumably majority, view recorded in the immediately prior sentence of the same Mishnah.<sup><xref rid="fn130">11</xref></sup> The principle presented in the earlier statement of the Mishnah is predicated upon the identical biblical verse adduced by Abba Saul in support of his rule and appears to be an alternative, and hence conflicting, exegetical interpretation of the cited phrase. Assuming that there is a controversy between Abba Saul and the exponents of the first principle, the statement recorded in the Tosefta may be understood as an expression of the view of those who, as recorded in the Mishnah, disagree with Abba Saul.<sup><xref rid="fn131">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic>, however, recognizes a difficulty inherent in his position. Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 5:6, rules in accordance with the position of Abba Saul in exempting a father and a messenger of the <italic>bet din</italic> from exile.<sup><xref rid="fn132">13</xref></sup> Hence, according to <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic>, it logically follows that a physician is also exempt from exile. <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic> expresses amazement that Ramban, in his <italic>Torat ha-Adam</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn133">14</xref></sup> cites the Tosefta&#x2019;s ruling with regard to the culpability of the physician without noting that the Tosefta&#x2019;s statement is at variance with the position of Abba Saul. <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic> further observes that the Tosefta is cited as normative by both <italic>Tur</italic> and <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:1.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is far from clear that there exists a controversy between Abba Saul and the authors of the first principle recorded in the Mishnah. R. Menachem ha-Me&#x2019;iri, <italic>&#x1E24;iddushei ha-Me&#x2019;iri</italic>, <italic>ad locum</italic>, expressly declares that there is no controversy and that the two principles are not mutually exclusive.<sup><xref rid="fn134">15</xref></sup> Me&#x2019;iri regards the diverse exegetical interpretations of the phrase &#x201C;in a forest&#x201D; presented in the Mishnah as complementary rather than contradictory. For Me&#x2019;iri, the term &#x201C;<italic>ya&#x2019;ar</italic>&#x201D; is paradigmatic in serving to exclude arenas that are not comparable to a &#x201C;forest&#x201D; in any salient respect. Moreover, Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 6:11, codifies the principle formulated in the earlier clause of the Mishnah. Thus, Rambam who, as previously noted, rules in accordance with Abba Saul, apparently saw no contradiction between Abba Saul&#x2019;s view and the principle earlier formulated in the Mishnah.</p>
<p>In stating that the Tosefta expresses a view at variance from that of Abba Saul, <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic> does not expressly assert that the Tosefta follows the position expressed in the initial statement of the Mishnah. <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic> may not have intended to posit a controversy between the Tanna&#x2019;im cited in the Mishnah but rather to have regarded the Tosefta as expressing the novel, extra-canonical view of a Tanna whose position was rejected by the Mishnah.<sup><xref rid="fn135">16</xref></sup> If so, the ruling of <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:1, in accordance with the Tosefta is all the more astonishing.</p>
<p>The apparent contradiction between the principle formulated by Abba Saul and the ruling of the Tosefta was first commented upon by R. Simon ben Zema&#x1E25; Duran, <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic>, III, no. 82. <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> raises the objection that &#x201C;the physician is also engaged in a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>&#x201D; and hence questions why the Tosefta regards the physician as culpable for misadventure. <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> cryptically comments that the case of the physician can be distinguished from that of a father or a teacher but fails to indicate the substantive nature of the distinction. That lacuna is filled by <italic>Teshuvot Besamim Rosh</italic>, no. 386, a work of uncertain provenance commonly, but probably spuriously, attributed to Rabbenu Asher.<sup><xref rid="fn136">17</xref></sup> <italic>Besamim Rosh</italic> observes that, whatever the result, in striking a child or a student, the father and the teacher are engaged in chastising the youth. Thus, even if the act had an untoward outcome it was nevertheless designed for an entirely different effect and, indeed, despite the subsequent tragic consequence, may well have served to cause the child to resolve to correct his behavior.<sup><xref rid="fn137">18</xref></sup> Not so a battery committed by a physician that fails in the therapeutic goal. The physician&#x2019;s obligation is to heal; an act that causes the death of a patient is not at all an act of healing. Hence the act, albeit well-intended, does not serve to fulfill any <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn138">19</xref></sup> Accordingly, since it turns out that a physician who causes the death of his patient has not fulfilled any <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> or discharged a duty, he is not excused from the penalty of exile. A similar distinction is drawn by <italic>Yad Avraham</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:1, in the name of <italic>Ma&#x2019;aseh Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>.</p>
<p>R. Chaim Joseph David Azulai, Birkei Yosef, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:6, also presents the same solution in the name of the author of <italic>Ma&#x2019;aseh Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>, R. Eli&#x2019;ezer of Cracow, but with a slight variation. That authority asserts that the Mishnah&#x2019;s exoneration of the father and the teacher is limited to usual situations in which the misadventure occurred despite the fact that the father or the teacher did not employ excessive force, i.e., they acted in a manner that was incumbent upon them.<sup><xref rid="fn139">20</xref></sup> However, the physician who causes the death of a patient has erred either in his assessment of the nature of the malady or of the appropriateness of the therapy he has administered.<sup><xref rid="fn140">21</xref></sup> Since the physician&#x2019;s act was performed in error,<sup><xref rid="fn141">22</xref></sup> the physician, despite his noble intentions, cannot be described as having been engaged in performing an act endowed with the nature of a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn142">23</xref></sup> It would follow that, according to <italic>Birkei Yosef</italic>, a physician who properly assesses his patient&#x2019;s condition and administers appropriate treatment is not subject to exile if the patient unpredictably dies for an unknown reason.</p>
<p>As will be shown subsequently, a number of contemporary authorities also understand the Tosefta&#x2019;s statement with regard to imposition of exile to be limited to situations involving particular forms of negligence on the part of the physician. If so, there is no contradiction between the Tosefta and the general rule formulated in the Mishnah.</p>
<h3>2. <italic>Ramban</italic></h3>
<p>The Gemara, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 85a, declares &#x201C;&#x2018;&#x2026; and he shall cause him to be thoroughly healed&#x2019; (Exodus 21:19.)&#x2014;From here [it is derived] that the physician has been given authority to heal.&#x201D; In Jewish law, as in all coherent legal systems, all activities are permissible unless they are expressly prohibited or contraindicated on the basis of some legal or moral consideration. If so, in the absence of any countervailing consideration, why should a physician require explicit permission to practice the healing arts? Absent the scriptural dispensation provided by this verse, why should a physician shrink from using his skills in order to cure a patient? In their respective commentaries on this talmudic passage, Rashi, <italic>Tosafot</italic> and Rashba explain that the constraint is theological in nature. To paraphrase Rashi&#x2019;s formulation: &#x201C;If God afflicts, how dare man attempt to cure?&#x201D; Or, as expressed by <italic>Tosafot</italic>, in curing the patient, the medical practitioner &#x201C;appears to thwart the divine decree.&#x201D; Such would be the physician&#x2019;s concern in the absence of specific dispensation; once permission is given, practice of the healing arts becomes intrinsic to God&#x2019;s providential guardianship of man and hence medical ministration is not only permissible or even commendable but is mandatory.<sup><xref rid="fn143">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his <italic>Torat ha-Adam, Shaar ha-Sakanah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn144">25</xref></sup> Ramban presents the foregoing rationale for the need of specific authorization to practice medicine but prefaces that comment with an entirely different explanation. The verse in question, declares Ramban, is necessary in order to teach that the practice of medicine is not forbidden because of the possibility of a disastrous outcome. The physician is given authority to heal &#x201C;lest the physician say: &#x2018;Why should I [seek] this vexation? Perhaps I will err with the result that I become an inadvertent slayer of human souls.&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn145">26</xref></sup> Elsewhere in his <italic>Torat ha-Adam</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn146">27</xref></sup> Ramban writes, &#x201C;&#x2026; since license was given to the physician to heal and, moreover, it is a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> that is incumbent upon him, he need have no concern; for if he conducts himself appropriately in accordance with his opinion he has naught but a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> in his medical ministrations, for God commands him to heal and his intellect coerced him to err.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ramban is however troubled by the fact that, despite scriptural reassurance that he should have no moral qualms, the physician, found qualified and licensed to practice medicine by the <italic>bet din</italic>, who errs and causes the death of his patient is nevertheless held culpable of manslaughter and, if his error is non-lethal, is liable&#x2014;at least according to the &#x201C;laws of Heaven&#x201D;&#x2014;to pay compensation to his victim. If the physician is commanded to treat his patient and to ignore the potential for inadvertent error, how can he be held liable for doing what he is duty-bound to do?</p>
<p>Ramban&#x2019;s resolution of the problem is startling, to say the least. His solution is novel but seemingly paradoxical. Ramban responds by stating that the situation of the physician is analogous to that of a judge. The <italic>dayyan</italic> is commanded to sit in judgment and, declares the Gemara, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 6b, &#x201C;Lest the judge say, &#x2018;Why should I seek this vexation?&#x2019; the verse states &#x2018;[God is] with you in the matter of judgment&#x2019; (II Chronicles 19:6)&#x2014;the <italic>dayyan</italic> has only what his eyes see.&#x201D; Nevertheless, in some circumstances, the <italic>dayyan</italic> will be held liable for judicial malpractice. Ramban adds the remarkable comment that the judge is liable &#x201C;if he errs and it becomes known to the <italic>bet din</italic> that he erred &#x2026; similarly [in the case of the physician], according to the laws of man he is not liable to payment but according to the laws of Heaven he is not quit until he pays for the damage and goes into exile for the death <italic>since it has become known that he erred</italic> [emphasis added] and has caused damage or caused death by means of a direct act.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ramban formulates the curious position that the judge and the physician are liable in the eyes of Heaven&#x2014;but only if they are found out. It is of course readily understood that neither the judge nor the physician can be required, even by Heaven, to make restitution if he remains unaware of his error and hence of his liability. But certainly Heaven is aware of the error and hence the person should not be guiltless in the eyes of Heaven even if, as a practical matter, he cannot be called upon to redress the wrong. A layman who commits an ordinary tort without ever becoming aware of the damage he caused, e.g., a person who throws a rock and unknowingly shatters a valuable vase, and whose act was unobserved, will never be called upon to make restitution simply because he is not identifiable as the tortfeasor but, assuredly, he is not guiltless in the eyes of Heaven. Yet the <italic>dayyan</italic> and the physician, declares Ramban, are guilty &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven&#x201D; only if it becomes known to them that they have caused harm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ramban&#x2019;s thesis is formulated in an attempt to resolve a difficulty but apparently falls short of doing so. Absent scriptural reassurance, the prudent physician and judge are pictured as abjuring their callings for fear of potential punishment. Assurance that liability is contingent upon actual awareness of resultant harm hardly seems to assuage such a concern.<sup><xref rid="fn147">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>It seems to this writer that Ramban&#x2019;s comment must be understood in light of the dual nature of the transgression inherent in misappropriation of property, commission of a tort and manslaughter. A person who deprives another of his property has committed an act of theft and in doing so has sinned against his fellow. In addition, he has violated the divine commandment prohibiting theft and has thereby sinned against God. The <italic>dayyan&#x2019;s</italic> putative concern that he may err in rendering judgment is not born of a concern for the welfare of the financially harmed litigant but of the <italic>dayyan&#x2019;s</italic> fear of sullying his own immortal soul by sinning against God. The verse &#x201C;God is with you in the matter of judgment&#x201D; serves to assure the judge that God joins in the judgment even if it is in error, i.e., insofar as God is concerned, the qualified judge who errs commits no sin. Indeed, theologically speaking, his error may, in a certain sense, be providentially ordained.<sup><xref rid="fn148">29</xref></sup> In concurring in the judgment of the <italic>bet din</italic>, The Heavenly Court renders judgment not simply upon the pleadings of the litigants but upon a totality of considerations, many of which are likely to be unknown to mortals.</p>
<p>That consideration, however, is relevant only from the divine perspective; insofar as the obligations of a man to his fellow man are concerned, &#x201C;[the Torah] is not in Heaven&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 30:12). Hence the <italic>dayyan</italic> may be required to compensate the victim of his mistake if, in terms of terrestrial considerations, the <italic>dayyan</italic> has committed a culpable error. But, since in the eyes of Heaven he is entirely guiltless and a person who is unaware of any harm that he may have caused cannot compensate the victim, Heaven must hold him guiltless in every sense unless he becomes aware of his error. Thus assured, the <italic>dayyan</italic> has no reason to shirk the duties of his office. The <italic>dayyan</italic> is dedicated to his sacred calling and, if competent, dare not be dissuaded by fear of potential financial loss.<sup><xref rid="fn149">30</xref></sup> If the <italic>dayyan</italic> errs, he will dutifully make restitution. His real fear is the fear of inadvertent sin and on that score the biblical verse serves to put his mind at ease.</p>
<p>Ramban, in this comment, formulates a remarkable thesis: Every trespass against one&#x2019;s fellow man constitutes a dual infraction: 1) an offense against one&#x2019;s fellow (<italic>bein adam le-&#x1E25;avero</italic>); and 2) an offense against God. Halakhah is replete with examples in which a <italic>bet din</italic> will not issue a monetary reward but the individual remains liable &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven.&#x201D; In such cases, Heaven will not grant forgiveness despite the fact that the aggrieved party is non-suited by the <italic>bet din</italic>. The dual nature of the infractions explains why there may be an obligation &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven&#x201D; even when there is no obligation at the hands of man.</p>
<p>Herein, in effect, Ramban posits the converse, i.e., an obligation &#x201C;at the hands of man&#x201D; despite the absence of liability in the eyes of Heaven. The <italic>dayyan</italic> who, in his error, unwittingly carried out a divine decree has committed no transgression against Heaven, but since the Torah &#x201C;is not in Heaven&#x201D; and since in terms of human considerations he has ruled improperly, he may be required to make restitution entirely as a matter of <italic>bein adam le-&#x1E25;avero</italic>. But such an obligation, since it is entirely between man and his fellow man, can be meaningful only when and if the existence of such an obligation becomes known to the guilty party. If it fails to become known, Heaven will impose no penalty because in the eyes of Heaven the individual in question is guiltless.</p>
<p>Having established this principle with regard to the <italic>dayyan</italic>, Ramban applies it as well to the physician who errs in treating his patient. A person who commits a battery commits a transgression <italic>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</italic> his fellow man as evidenced by the requirement to compensate for the harm done. In causing physical harm to another, he also transgresses the divine commandment &#x201C;he shall not exceed&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 25:3).<sup><xref rid="fn150">31</xref></sup> The physician who errs in treating his patient is not engaged in therapeutic &#x201C;wounding&#x201D; excluded from that prohibition; he has committed a simple battery and has reason to fear that he has committed an offence against the Deity. Fear of committing such a transgression might well serve to discourage the physician from engaging in his profession. The verse &#x201C;and he shall cause him to be thoroughly healed,&#x201D; according to the understanding of the passage advanced by Ramban, serves completely to exonerate the physician from any transgression. In drawing a parallel between the <italic>dayyan</italic> and the physician Ramban undoubtedly intends to assert that any harm caused by the physician is the result of Heavenly decree. That concept is eloquently captured in the medical context in an aphorism coined by R. Moshe &#x1E24;agiz: &#x201C;The unintentional act of the physician is the intent of the Creator.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn151">32</xref></sup> Since the erring physician is, in effect, a divine messenger, Heaven can hardly hold him responsible for the untoward results of his ministration.</p>
<p>But, again, the Torah &#x201C;is not in Heaven.&#x201D; Hence, in terms of obligation to his fellow man, the physician remains responsible for making his victim whole. But that is an obligation the physician incurs entirely <italic>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</italic> his fellow man and is devoid of any &#x201C;religious&#x201D; implications.<sup><xref rid="fn152">33</xref></sup> In other cases failure to satisfy a financial obligation constitutes a &#x201C;religious&#x201D; infraction as well. Depending upon the circumstances, the &#x201C;religious&#x201D; obligation with regard to monetary compensation is born of an obligation to restore stolen or lost property, of contractual liability or of an obligation in tort. The physician&#x2019;s &#x201C;religious&#x201D; obligation could only be of the latter category but since he acts at the divine behest no such &#x201C;religious&#x201D; obligation exists. Accordingly, his obligation is solely in the nature of a duty owed a fellow man with no parallel duty to God to fulfill that duty. Hence, according to Ramban, if the physician remains unaware of his error he cannot be held culpable in any sense of the term.</p>
<p>However, it should then follow that when the error becomes known, the physician, no less so than the <italic>dayyan</italic>, should be held liable by the <italic>bet din</italic>. That is indeed the case according to biblical law. However, the Tosefta, <italic>Gittin</italic> 3:13, declares that the Sages found it necessary to grant the physician immunity &#x201C;for the welfare of society&#x201D; (<italic>mipnei tikkun ha-olam</italic>). In effect, they recognized that failure to hold a physician guiltless in instances of misadventure would result in many physicians declining to practice medicine for fear of financial liability. Nevertheless, the obligation &#x201C;<italic>bein adam le-&#x1E25;avero</italic>&#x201D; remains &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven&#x201D; even though in the eyes of Heaven the physician has done no wrong. The guilt recognized by Heaven is not for a sin against the Deity but for an offense against the victim. Apparently no similar conferral of blanket immunity was regarded as necessary in order to entice a qualified scholar to serve as a <italic>dayyan</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn153">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The statement that the physician is liable &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven&#x201D; even though in the eyes of Heaven he has committed no harm means simply that a moral obligation <italic>bein adam le-&#x1E25;avero</italic> does exist. Moreover, the statement has a very practical effect, <italic>viz.</italic>, the victim is entitled to exercise self-help (<italic>tefisah</italic>), i.e., seizure of property or funds, without authorization of the <italic>bet din</italic>. According to many authorities self-help is a remedy available in all cases in which Halakhah posits an obligation &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn154">35</xref></sup> particularly in instances in which the obligation is biblical in nature.<sup><xref rid="fn155">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ramban&#x2019;s comment with regard to culpability for exile may be understood in a similar fashion. The nature of exile in instances of inadvertent manslaughter is complex. In a number of instances<sup><xref rid="fn156">37</xref></sup> the Gemara describes exile as a form of expiation, i.e., as atonement for inadvertent transgression of the prohibition against homicide. However, since Ramban asserts that the physician who &#x201C;conducts himself appropriately &#x2026; has naught but a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>,&#x201D; such a physician is clearly not in need of expiation.</p>
<p>Exile serves not only as expiation but as a punishment as well.<sup><xref rid="fn157">38</xref></sup> Evidence that exile is also a form of punishment is found in the discussion of the Gemara, <italic>Makkot</italic> 2b, regarding the punishment of witnesses who by accusing a person of manslaughter seek to have him banished to one of the cities of refuge and whose testimony is impeached (<italic>edim zomemim</italic>). The general rule is that such witnesses receive punishment in kind, i.e., they are accorded the selfsame punishment they sought to have meted out to the defendant against whom they testified. Witnesses who testify with regard to unintentional manslaughter but who are impeached are not themselves subjected to exile. However, that is so only because they are expressly excluded from exile on the basis of exegetical interpretation of a biblical verse. It is readily established that the punishment of impeached witnesses is not designed to expiate their transgression as evidenced by the fact that the Gemara, <italic>Makkot</italic> 2b, declares that witnesses are not liable to monetary payment in the form of <italic>kofer</italic>, or &#x201C;atonement,&#x201D; if their testimony concerning an ox that gores a person is impeached.</p>
<p>The master of an ox that has previously committed such acts and who has been properly admonished regarding the irascible nature of his animal is liable to payment of a sum of money in an amount equal to the amount the victim might have commanded were he to be sold as a slave. That payment is designated as &#x201C;<italic>kofer</italic>&#x201D; or &#x201C;atonement,&#x201D; i.e., it is designed, not as restitution, but as expiation of the transgression inherent in the master&#x2019;s negligence in not exercising proper supervision over his ox. However, in contradistinction to other cases of false testimony, witnesses who seek to subject the master of an ox to such punishment but whose testimony is impeached are not subject to monetary punishment in the form of <italic>kofer</italic>. The principle reflected in this provision is that impeached witnesses are subject to punishment but their punishment does not serve to expiate their transgression.<sup><xref rid="fn158">39</xref></sup> Accordingly, since the essence and purpose of <italic>kofer</italic> is expiation and atonement, whereas the punishment of impeached witnesses is not designed to serve as expiation, impeached witnesses are not called upon to make such payment. Thus, since an explicit biblical verse is necessary to exclude impeached witnesses from the penalty of exile, it is evident that the exile to which impeached witnesses would have been subjected had Scripture not excluded them from that penalty would have been in the nature of punishment rather than of expiation. But, assuredly, the physician who &#x201C;has naught but a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>&#x201D; does not deserve to be punished.</p>
<p>However, exile serves a third purpose as well, <italic>viz.</italic>, it serves to preserve the perpetrator from vengeance at the hands of the blood-avenger.<sup><xref rid="fn159">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ramban&#x2019;s comment to the effect that the verse &#x201C;and he shall cause him to be thoroughly healed&#x201D; serves to assure the physician that he need not be concerned over possible unintentional manslaughter &#x201C;unless he becomes aware that he has erred&#x201D; can be understood on the basis of the multifaceted purpose of exile. In this case as well, the physician whom Scripture seeks to reassure is not a physician whose concern is his own safety or well-being but the physician whose concern is the possibility of transgression. The verse serves to establish that a physician who errs inadvertently has committed no transgression whatsoever. Hence, he incurs no Heavenly punishment and requires no expiation. Accordingly, if he never discovers his error, nothing is lost. He is, however, subject to the wrath of the blood-avenger.<sup><xref rid="fn160">41</xref></sup> That, however, is a contingency that he need not fear unless his error becomes known. But even if his error becomes known he faces no temporal danger because of the safety afforded him through exile in a city of refuge.<sup><xref rid="fn161">42</xref></sup></p>
<h1>III. <italic>Exclusion from Culpability for Exile</italic></h1>
<p>As noted earlier, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:1, in accordance with the statement recorded in the Tosefta, rules that a physician who causes the death of his patient is liable to exile. Ostensibly, the sources recording the physician&#x2019;s culpability for exile declare that he is liable to banishment for causing the death of the patient regardless of whether he has been negligent. Ofttimes a surgeon performs an operation knowing quite well that there is a statistical probability that the patient will not survive the surgery. Nevertheless, both the surgeon and the patient assume that risk because, absent surgical intervention, death is either a certainty or more likely to occur. However, on the basis of the distinction drawn by the <italic>Birkei Yosef</italic> between a father or a teacher on the one hand and a physician on the other, there would appear to be no reason to require exile in such circumstances. In such an instance the physician commits no error. He is engaged in an attempt to perform a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> no less so than the father who engages in an attempt to chastise a son or a teacher who endeavors to correct a pupil. However, that conclusion does not flow from the earlier-cited distinction formulated by <italic>Besamim Rosh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn162">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>The question of the culpability of a physician who causes the death of his patient but who has committed no error is also addressed by a number of contemporary authorities. R. Zalman Nechemiah Goldberg, <italic>Te&#x1E25;umin</italic>, XIX (5759), 320, asserts that, since there is no element of &#x201C;error,&#x201D; the situation is comparable to a case of <italic>ones</italic>, or unavoidable death, which does not entail exile. That analysis is imprecise in the sense that in cases of statistical danger the physician knowingly and willingly assumes the attendant risk.<sup><xref rid="fn163">44</xref></sup> Assuming that negligence is not a necessary element in imposition of the penalty of exile, the physician should indeed be culpable since the situation is not akin to a case of unavoidable or unpreventable death and certainly not to a case of <italic>force majeure</italic>.</p>
<p>Other scholars clearly go beyond Rabbi Goldberg&#x2019;s position and maintain that a physician who causes the death of a patient through no fault of his own but as the result of a <italic>bona fide</italic> error of judgment is not liable to exile. One authority, R. Yechiel Michel Epstein, <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:2, asserts that a physician is exiled only if the misadventure he has caused was the result of &#x201C;laziness&#x201D; (<italic>hitrashlut</italic>) or failure to exercise due diligence (<italic>lo iyein yafeh</italic>). From a parenthetical comment incorporated in that ruling it appears that <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> understands that the distinction between a father or a teacher and a physician as reflected in the Tosefta lies in the consideration that the physician to whom the Tosefta refers is a physician who has been negligent in discharging his duties whereas the father and the teacher of whom the Mishnah speaks have not been negligent.</p>
<p>R. Shlomoh Zalman Auerbach, as quoted by Abraham S. Abraham, <italic>Nishmat Avraham</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 376:1, note 7, suggests that the penalty of exile is not imposed in instances of an error in judgment. That penalty, he suggests, is imposed only if the physician performs an unintended act, e.g., he reaches for the wrong medicine or erroneously takes hold of a non-sterilized scalpel.<sup><xref rid="fn164">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>A similar but markedly different view is reflected in the comments of R. Moses Feinstein, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh, Even ha-Ezer</italic>, IV, no. 31, s.v. <italic>u-mah she-nizkar</italic>. <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> declares that as long as there is no better-qualified physician available and the physician has acted with due deliberation in accordance with his knowledge and skill his act is regarded as tantamount to that of an <italic>anus</italic> i.e., a person whose act is unavoidable, and he is not liable to exile. Action on the part of the physician in accordance with the dictates of his intellect resulting in misadventure is thus equated with <italic>force majeure</italic>. Thus, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> is in agreement with <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> and Rabbi Auerbach in ruling that non-negligent error does not render the physician culpable for exile. However, unlike <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> asserts that if the physician acted &#x201C;in haste&#x201D; (<italic>be-behilut</italic>), even if it seemed to him that no further reflection was necessary, the physician is also exempt from exile. In that case, however, the physician is exempt from exile, not because he is without guilt, but because the physician&#x2019;s negligence is of a magnitude for which exile is an insufficient punishment. Exile, opines <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, is reserved solely for situations in which</p>
<p align="blockquote">the matter was not urgent and it would have been possible to wait for a more highly qualified physician or in situations in which the physician was the most highly qualified but he did not reflect more than his wont, then if [he acted] in accordance with the manner of physicians [in which case] there is no negligence, he is liable to exile and [exile] serves as expiation [for his transgression].</p>
<p>Presumably, reaching in haste for the wrong medicine or for an unsterilized scalpel, according to <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, would not result in exile because such an act constitutes gross negligence for which exile is an insufficient expiation.</p>
<p>Failure to administer a diagnostic test that would have led to proper treatment represents an act of nonfeasance rather than malfeasance. Accordingly, it would follow that such forms of malpractice should not result either in subjecting the physician to exile or to liability to tort damages. However, if failure to administer such a test leads to overt intervention resulting in the death of the patient, the physician, according to <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, would seem to be culpable for such intervention since failure to administer such a test represents failure to exercise due diligence (<italic>lo iyein yafeh</italic>). Similarly, according to <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, the physician must be judged to have acted &#x201C;in haste&#x201D; (<italic>be-behilut</italic>). However, according to Rabbi Auerbach, if the physician did not order the test because he erroneously regarded it to be unnecessary, and proceeded with treatment that results in harm he has committed an error of judgment for which he does not incur the penalty of exile.</p>
<p>Similarly, an act of omission cannot result in liability for tort damages, although if the physician is regarded as a bailee, as will be discussed later, he may be liable for resultant damages by virtue of having failed to perform his duties as a bailee.<sup><xref rid="fn165">46</xref></sup> Tort liability for harm caused by active intervention that would have been avoided had the diagnostic test been ordered must be examined in the context of the general provisions governing a physician&#x2019;s liability and, as will be discussed subsequently,<sup><xref rid="fn166">47</xref></sup> may be contingent upon a possible distinction between ordinary negligence and gross negligence in the physician&#x2019;s failure to administer the diagnostic test.</p>
<p>R. Moses Sofer, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 177, presents a position that appears not only to qualify the ruling of <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> but also to be at variance from that normative ruling. In that responsum <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> addresses a tragic case of inadvertent poisoning. A servant girl fainted from sudden fright. Her mistress sought to revive her by giving her whiskey to drink. However, in reaching for the flask of whiskey she inadvertently took hold of a jar of &#x201C;petrol&#x201D; (probably kerosene). The liquid poured into the young lady&#x2019;s throat &#x201C;went down into her innards and the lass was burned.&#x201D; Her mistress, understandably consumed by feelings of guilt, sought advice with regard to a proper form of expiation. In his responsum, <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> opines that the woman who administered the poisonous substance was far less culpable than a father or a teacher who chastises a child. Hence, asserts <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, were such a penalty still imposed in our day, she would not be subject to the punishment of exile. <italic>Rav Pe&#x2019;alim</italic>, III, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 36, s.v. <italic>ve-atah</italic>, objects to <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer&#x2019;s</italic> analysis on the grounds that the case of the woman is comparable to that of a physician who, according to the Tosefta and the ruling of <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:1, is liable to exile. The same objection was later raised by R. Yitzchak Ya&#x2019;akov Weisz, <italic>Teshuvot Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>, III, no. 104, sec. 5.<sup><xref rid="fn167">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Samson Aaron Polonski, <italic>Divrei Aharon</italic>, no. 34, sec. 2, attempts to defend <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer&#x2019;s</italic> response by arguing that it is predicated upon an earlier ruling of R. Simon ben &#x1E92;ema&#x1E25; Duran, <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic>, III, no. 82. As will later be more fully discussed, <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> asserts that a physician is culpable only for death resulting from an act performed by his own hand or by an instrument wielded by him, but that a physician who treats patients by means of &#x201C;liquids or medicaments&#x201D; is not similarly liable even &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven.&#x201D; <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic>&#x2019; distinction is presumably based upon the consideration that culpability is contingent upon proximate cause which, in Jewish law, is narrowly defined.<sup><xref rid="fn168">49</xref></sup> Harm done by a hand is direct; poison, however, must first be absorbed by the body and hence the resultant harm is indirect, i.e., it is effected through a form of <italic>gerama</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn169">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>That analysis of <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer&#x2019;s</italic> position seems implausible. <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer&#x2019;s</italic> choice of words in describing the effect of the poison as &#x201C;burning&#x201D; internal organs was probably expressly intended to distinguish the case under discussion from the type of act for which <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> declined to assign culpability.<sup><xref rid="fn170">51</xref></sup> Pouring acid on a person&#x2019;s body is no less the proximate cause of resultant harm than is incision with a scalpel. The effect of acid is far different and far more immediate than poison that, to do harm, must first enter the bloodstream. <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer&#x2019;s</italic> description of the &#x201C;burning&#x201D; effect of &#x201C;petrol&#x201D; clearly indicates that he presumed the effect to be comparable to that of acid.</p>
<p>Even more problematic is the fact that, in addressing an entirely different incident in <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic>, no. 184, <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> remarks, &#x201C;for indeed the Sages, <italic>ipso facto</italic>, exempted from exile a physician who causes the death of a patient.&#x201D; That categorical statement seems to be erroneous since the only explicit mention of a physician occurs in the Tosefta and the Tosefta declares the physician to be subject to exile.<sup><xref rid="fn171">52</xref></sup></p>
<h1>IV. <italic>Financial Liability</italic></h1>
<h3>1. <italic>The Problem</italic></h3>
<p>Unlike exile, which has lapsed in our era, a suit for actual physical harm continues to be actionable before a <italic>bet din</italic>. The rule with regard to financial liability in instances of malpractice is recorded in <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:1. <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> declares:</p>
<p align="blockquote">[A physician] should not engage in the practice of medicine unless he is proficient and [only if] there is no one greater than he in that [locale] for otherwise he is a shedder of blood. If [the physician] practices medicine without license of a <italic>bet din</italic> [and causes harm] he is liable for payment even if he is proficient. However, if he practices medicine with license of a <italic>bet din</italic> but errs and causes harm he is not liable according to the laws of man but he is liable according to the laws of Heaven.</p>
<p>That ruling is based upon two separate statements of the Tosefta. The Tosefta, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic>, 6:6, states that a physician who practices with license of a <italic>bet din</italic> and causes harm &#x201C;is exempt according to the laws of man but his judgment is turned over to Heaven&#x201D; and posits the same rule with regard to a physician who performs an embryotomy. In antiquity, since a Caesarian section almost always resulted in the death of the mother, an embryotomy was the sole available means of preserving the life of a woman carrying a hydrocephalic fetus whose head was too large to pass through the birth canal. The rule with regard to medical malpractice is repeated in somewhat different language by the Tosefta, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 9:3. In the latter formulation the rule pertaining to the physician is coupled with identical rules applicable to a father, a teacher and an agent of the <italic>bet din</italic>. With regard to each of those individuals the rule presented by the Tosefta provides that when the individual acts with permission of the <italic>bet din</italic> he is not liable but includes the caveat that &#x201C;if he wounds more than is proper he is liable.&#x201D;</p>
<p><italic>Magen Avraham</italic>, in his commentary on the earlier statement of the Tosefta, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 6:6, explains that the provision indicating that the judgment of the physician who causes harm &#x201C;is turned over to Heaven&#x201D; connotes nothing more than a declaration of the physician&#x2019;s liability for intentional infliction of harm.<sup><xref rid="fn172">53</xref></sup> <italic>Magen Avraham</italic> understands the Tosefta as declaring simply that, since God knows the physician&#x2019;s intention, He will hold the physician liable for willful battery; however, a physician who had no intention of causing harm is guiltless even in the eyes of Heaven. <italic>Magen Avraham</italic>&#x2019;s analysis of the Tosefta is clearly contradicted by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>. Following Ramban&#x2019;s earlier-cited statement, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> declares unequivocally that the physician &#x201C;is liable according to the laws of Heaven.&#x201D; Unlike the phrase &#x201C;turned over to Heaven,&#x201D; which may connote that the matter is left to Heaven for adjudication in light of the attendant circumstances, the term &#x201C;is liable according to the law of Heaven&#x201D; is a declaration of absolute liability that is quite independent of intent. <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> and Ramban apparently understood the phrase &#x201C;but his judgment is turned over to Heaven&#x201D; as an unqualified statement indicating liability, at least in the eyes of Heaven, for even inadvertent harm.</p>
<p>The notion of exoneration by a human court but culpability in the eyes of Heaven is not immediately recognizable as an application of general principles of tort liability with regard to battery. As previously noted, the Gemara, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 26b, establishes the principle that, unlike harm caused by a person&#x2019;s animal or property, a person is always liable for damage caused by his body (<italic>adam ha-mazik</italic>). If so, it would follow that a physician should be held responsible for any harm that he causes, regardless of whether the damage is the result of negligence or of misadventure. Although Ramban, <italic>Bava Me&#x1E93;i&#x2019;a</italic> 82b, and as cited by <italic>Shitah Mekubbe&#x1E93;et</italic>, <italic>Bava Me&#x1E93;i&#x2019;a</italic> 82b, s.v. <italic>ve-atah be-shem</italic>, disagrees, <italic>Tosafot</italic>, <italic>Bava Me&#x1E93;i&#x2019;a</italic> 82b, do carve out an exception to that rule in instances of an entirely unavoidable harm (<italic>ones gamur</italic>) as, for example, in the case of a person who rolls over in his sleep and in the course of doing so breaks utensils that have been placed next to him.</p>
<p>Presumably, the harm for which a physician is not liable by a <italic>bet din</italic> but for which he is held accountable in the eyes of Heaven is not of the nature of an entirely unavoidable misadventure for which, according to <italic>Tosafot</italic>, there is no liability. This assessment is based upon two factors: 1) according to <italic>Tosafot</italic>, if the harm was entirely unavoidable, there is no liability even in the eyes of Heaven; 2) <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> rules that the same act, if it leads to the death of the patient, results in exile of the physician. As shown earlier, many latter-day authorities maintain that a physician is subject to exile only if he could have avoided the death of the patient by modifying the therapeutic procedure or if the procedure was performed in error. It is certainly the case that, according to <italic>Tosafot</italic>, a physician who properly performs a needed procedure that inadvertently results in harm as a result of sheer misadventure incurs no liability even in the eyes of Heaven. Thus, according to <italic>Tosafot</italic>, the liability &#x201C;according to the laws of Heaven&#x201D; of which the Tosefta and <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> speak is limited to instances of harm resulting from some form of negligence. According to <italic>Tosafot</italic>, there are no exemptions from tort liability with regard to harm caused by a person; hence, according to <italic>Tosafot</italic>, financial liability should exist not only &#x201C;according to the laws of Heaven&#x201D; but should be imposed by a terrestrial <italic>bet din</italic> as well.</p>
<h3>2. Mipnei Tikkun ha-Olam</h3>
<h4>a) <italic>Financial Immunity</italic></h4>
<p>The concept of liability &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven&#x201D; must be understood on the basis of yet a third statement recorded in the Tosefta. The Tosefta, <italic>Gittin</italic> 3:13, declares: &#x201C;A physician who practices medicine with the license of a <italic>bet din</italic> and causes harm: if inadvertently, he is not liable; if intentionally, he is liable&#x2014;because of the welfare of society (<italic>mipnei tikkun ha-olam</italic>).&#x201D; The phrase &#x201C;<italic>mipnei tikkun ha-olam</italic>&#x201D; must be understood as explaining the first portion of the Tosefta&#x2019;s compound statement, i.e., as explaining why the physician is exonerated in cases of inadvertent harm, rather than as explaining why he is liable for intentional harm as recorded in the second portion of that statement.<sup><xref rid="fn173">54</xref></sup> Thus the Tosefta, in effect, informs us that, the physician in principle should be fully liable even for harm caused inadvertently but that he is exonerated because of concern for the welfare of society, i.e., he is exonerated from tort liability by rabbinic decree designed to promote the welfare of society. The Sages were concerned that a person possessing medical skills might be fearful of malpractice liability and therefore renounce the practice of medicine. Accordingly, the Sages conferred qualified immunity upon the physician in order that he not be discouraged from practicing his profession. The Sages decreed only that the <italic>bet din</italic> not render judgment against the physician; they did not seek to abrogate the fundamental biblical law. Accordingly, the physician remains liable &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thus the basic problem is resolved: In terms of biblical law the physician is fully liable in accordance with the principle <italic>adam mu&#x2019;ad le-olam</italic>; he is exonerated solely by reason of rabbinic enactment <italic>mipnei tikkun haolam</italic>. The remaining question is a determination of the parameters of the immunity conferred upon the physician by the Sages.</p>
<h4>b) <italic>Exclusions from Immunity</italic></h4>
<h5>(1) <italic>Improper Conduct</italic></h5>
<p>As noted earlier, the Tosefta, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 9:3, declares that a physician who &#x201C;wounds more than is proper&#x201D; is liable for damages. The clear implication is that such damages are to be awarded by the <italic>bet din</italic>. In order to make that statement compatible with the statements of the Tosefta, <italic>Gittin</italic> 3:83 and <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 6:6, exonerating the physician in cases of error, R. Simon ben &#x1E92;ema&#x1E25; Duran, <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic>, III, no. 82, explains that the phrase &#x201C;more than is proper&#x201D; refers to intentional infliction of harm for which the physician is, of course, liable as is expressly stated by the Tosefta, <italic>Gittin</italic> 3:13. A similar act resulting in the death of the victim, adds <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic>, would not lead to exile because a person who willfully takes a life is not subject to exile even though he cannot be executed because of lack of prior admonition. R. Yechezkel Abramsky, <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ye&#x1E25;ezkel</italic>, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 9:3, <italic>&#x1E24;iddushim</italic>, depicts wounding &#x201C;more than is proper&#x201D; as an act that is &#x201C;<italic>kemezid</italic>,&#x201D; i.e., as an act that is akin to an intentional act. In his <italic>Bi&#x2019;urim</italic>, <italic>loc. cit.</italic>, Rabbi Abramsky adds the comment &#x201C;for to that extent it is within his power to safeguard himself that he not wound.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There appears to be a significant difference between the comments of <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> and those of Rabbi Abramsky with regard to the proper understanding of the Tosefta. According to <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic>, a physician can never be held liable for negligence; his liability, as announced by the Tosefta, is limited to wanton infliction of harm that is tantamount to mayhem. Rabbi Abramsky, however, understands the Tosefta as extending the physician&#x2019;s liability beyond intentional infliction of harm.<sup><xref rid="fn174">55</xref></sup> According to Rabbi Abramsky, the phrase &#x201C;wounding more than is proper&#x201D; connotes extending an incision or incising the wrong area and is paradigmatic of an act that a prudent physician would not perform even inadvertently. As noted earlier, according to <italic>Tosafot</italic>, a person is never liable, even in the eyes of Heaven, for a harm that is entirely unforeseen and hence completely unavoidable.</p>
<p>In what case, then, is there liability in the eyes of Heaven but no award of damages by a <italic>bet din</italic>? The Tosefta, according to Rabbi Abramsky&#x2019;s understanding, seems to refer to an act that in other legal systems would be categorized as gross negligence as opposed to ordinary negligence. Constant vigilance requires uninterrupted attention and concentration and a person, although endeavoring to be prudent, may momentarily relax his vigilance and commit a negligent act that might have been avoided, but only with a greater degree of attentiveness. Gross negligence results, not from a momentary lapse of concentration, but from a type of thoughtlessness or inattention that is readily avoidable. The Tosefta presumes that cutting tissue more extensively than is necessary is an example of gross negligence. In exempting the physician from liability lest he be deterred from practicing medicine, the Sages found it necessary to exempt the physician only from liability resulting from ordinary negligence. Since no person is always unflaggingly vigilant, sooner or later every physician will commit an act that must technically be categorized as a negligent act. Failure to protect a physician from liability that he must anticipate as a virtual certainty may prompt the physician to seek another means of earning a livelihood. Therefore, the Sages conferred immunity from financial liability upon him &#x201C;<italic>mipnei tikkun ha-olam</italic>.&#x201D; Gross negligence, however, is not at all inevitable. A competent physician does not anticipate that in the course of his career he will be guilty of gross negligence. Hence the specter of liability in instances of gross negligence will not induce him to forsake medicine. Moreover, it may well be assumed that the Sages would have indeed preferred that a person who, knowing his own nature, recognizes that he will be prone to gross negligence desist from the practice of medicine.</p>
<p>Curiously, R. Samuel ha-Levi Woszner, <italic>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 151, cites <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;&#x2019;</italic> interpretation of the phrase &#x201C;more than is proper&#x201D; verbatim but proceeds to rule in a manner consistent with Rabbi Abramsky&#x2019;s understanding of the Tosefta. The question that came before Rabbi Woszner involved a dentist who, in the course of drilling a diseased tooth, caused the drill to penetrate a healthy tooth. The issue confronting Rabbi Woszner was the dentist&#x2019;s liability for expenses incurred in the repair of the healthy tooth that the dentist had damaged. In his responsum <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> cites the comments of <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> and without further elaboration adds &#x201C;but if &#x2026; he drilled in a site in which he did not need [to drill], even if it was in the nature of an inadvertent act, with regard to the law of compensation, it is [regarded as] purposeful.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn175">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>As <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> himself notes, there are situations in which cutting or drilling healthy tissue is not necessarily indicative of negligence. Nevertheless, in the overwhelming majority of cases, it is likely that incision of healthy tissue occurs because of negligence. Somewhat surprisingly, <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> concludes that the physician or dentist cannot be exonerated unless the practitioner &#x201C;had no control over his hand whatsoever.&#x201D; That conclusion is surprising since <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> presumably accepts a distinction between what has earlier been categorized as &#x201C;gross negligence&#x201D; versus ordinary negligence.<sup><xref rid="fn176">57</xref></sup> If so, there are undoubtedly some situations in which a practitioner has not lost control of his hand but, nevertheless, has not been grossly negligent.<sup><xref rid="fn177">58</xref></sup></p>
<h5>(2) <italic>Absence of Licensure</italic></h5>
<p>In conferring financial immunity upon the physician the Sages limited this enactment to a physician who ministers to patients &#x201C;with permission of the <italic>bet din</italic>.&#x201D; Since, in our day, the practice of <italic>bet din</italic> licensure of physicians has lapsed, the applicability of the rule providing for such immunity is subject to question. Citing <italic>Maharil, Birkei Yosef, Shiyurei Berakhah, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 328:1, declares that when the civil authorities regulate the practice of medicine and grant licenses to practitioners no further permission from a <italic>bet din</italic> is needed. <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:2, also seems to regard government licensure as tantamount to authority conveyed by a <italic>bet din</italic>. In his earlier-cited responsum, <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> is even more explicit in stating that, in our day, the <italic>bet din</italic>, in effect, constructively acquiesces to licensure by civil authorities.</p>
<p><italic>Divrei Sha&#x2019;ul</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:1, cites <italic>Bet Hillel</italic> who defines a &#x201C;proficient&#x201D; physician (<italic>mum&#x1E25;eh</italic>) as one who possesses a &#x201C;document [issued] by the great physicians in the places where he studied the science [testifying] that he studied and is proficient.&#x201D;</p>
<p><italic>Bet Hillel</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:1, declares that the status of any physician accepted by the populace of the city is identical to that of a physician who has been licensed by a <italic>bet din</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn178">59</xref></sup> <italic>Bet Hillel&#x2019;s</italic> ruling is predicated upon the consideration that, in licensing the physicians, the <italic>bet din</italic> is not performing a judicial function. Rather, the <italic>bet din</italic> is acting in an administrative capacity in order to preserve the health and welfare of the members of their society. Preservation of social welfare is an inherent right and duty of society. Thus, in this matter, as in other matters, the <italic>bet din</italic> acts in a representative capacity in exercising the regulatory power of the society it represents. Nevertheless, in a final comment, <italic>Divrei Sha&#x2019;ul</italic> seems to bemoan the fact that licensure by the <italic>bet din</italic> has lapsed.</p>
<p><italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:1, rules that, despite having received permission of the <italic>bet din</italic> to practice medicine, a physician should not treat a patient if a more qualified practitioner is available. That ruling apparently applies even to a physician who has been granted permission to practice medicine by a <italic>bet din</italic>. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ye&#x1E25;ezkel</italic>, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 9:3, explicitly declares that a physician who fails to defer to a more qualified practitioner &#x201C;has no license from the <italic>bet din</italic>&#x201D; and, in case of misadventure, is to be held liable as would be the case were he an unlicensed practitioner. In effect, the license granted a physician by the <italic>bet din</italic> is qualified in nature and is contingent upon the unavailability of a more proficient practitioner.</p>
<p><italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, IV, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 151, expresses doubt with regard to whether, in contemporary society, the obligation to defer to a more qualified practitioner remains in effect since, in our day, physicians who are both &#x201C;more and less qualified practice this profession and all of them are licensed.&#x201D; Although R. Eliezer Waldenberg, <italic>Ramat Ra&#x1E25;el</italic>, no. 22, sec. 5, declares that it is not necessary to refer a patient to a more competent specialist when both the complaint and the treatment are well-known and routine, <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> is certainly in error with regard to any non-routine matter requiring informed medical judgment and sophisticated decision-making. In such cases the patient must be referred to the more competent and more experienced specialist provided that time permits and that the specialist is willing and able to treat the patient. Similarly, when the sheer number of patients is so great that the more proficient specialist cannot adequately treat all who are in need of his services, a less competent physician is not only permitted to treat, but must treat, the patient as long as he is the best qualified of the physicians available to the patient.<sup><xref rid="fn179">60</xref></sup></p>
<h5>(3) Mipnei Tikkun ha-Olam <italic>in Light of Ramban&#x2019;s Analysis of the Liability of an Artisan</italic></h5>
<p>According to Ramban, who, as noted earlier, maintains that an individual is liable for even unforeseen and unavoidable harm caused by his person, it would seem that a rabbinic decree conferring immunity from tort liability was necessary to provide immunity not only in instances of ordinary negligence but in cases of absolutely unavoidable harm as well. However, such a conclusion may not be correct. Indeed, according to Ramban, <italic>Bava Me&#x1E93;i&#x2019;a</italic> 82b and as cited by <italic>Shita Mekubbe&#x1E93;et</italic>, <italic>ibid</italic>., s.v. <italic>ve-atah be-shem</italic>, the principle <italic>adam mu&#x2019;ad le-olam</italic> should not apply to a physician acting with the consent of his patient and not compensated for his services. The Gemara, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 99b, declares that an uncompensated ritual slaughterer who, in the process of slaughtering the animal, inadvertently renders it non-kosher is not liable for damages; if, however, he receives a fee for his services he is liable. Ramban apparently maintains that an artisan is not liable for damages in tort since he acts with the permission of the owner of the property. In effect, Ramban concedes that although, in principle, a person who causes unavoidable harm is liable for his act, nevertheless, one who performs the act with the permission of the person harmed thereby is not liable in tort for unavoidable damage. Hence an artisan is liable as a bailee rather than as a tortfeasor. There is, however, a difference between liability as a tortfeasor and liability as a bailee. Were the artisan to be regarded as a tortfeasor, his liability would be absolute; whereas, as a gratuitous bailee, he is liable only if he is negligent. If the artisan receives compensation his status is that of a bailee for hire who is liable for all damages other than those incurred as a result of <italic>ones</italic>, i.e., damages totally beyond his control.</p>
<p>The statement of the Tosefta indicating that a physician is immune from liability only by virtue of rabbinic decree is problematic when examined from the vantage point of Ramban&#x2019;s position. It would stand to reason that the status of the physician should be identical to that of the slaughterer, i.e., the physician who acts with the consent of the patient should not be liable as a tortfeasor just as the slaughterer is not regarded as a tortfeasor. Thus a physician who receives no fee should not be liable for damages. Even assuming that the physician is regarded in Halakhah as a bailee,<sup><xref rid="fn180">61</xref></sup> the physician who has faithfully discharged his duties cannot be held liable even in the eyes of Heaven unless he is compensated for his services. However, in assigning liability to the physician according to biblical law, the Tosefta makes no distinction between a physician who charges a fee and a physician who renders his services <italic>pro bono</italic>. The problem, then, is that, even if he is regarded as a bailee, a physician who is not compensated should, according to Ramban, have the status of a gratuitous bailee who, even absent a rabbinic decree, is not liable other than for damage that occurs as a result of negligence.<sup><xref rid="fn181">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Yechezkel Abramsky, <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ye&#x1E25;ezkel</italic>, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 9:3, in drawing a distinction between a physician and a father or a teacher identical to the distinction cited earlier in the name of <italic>Besamim Rosh</italic>, asserts that Ramban&#x2019;s rationale in exempting an artisan from tort liability is applicable only if the damage is caused by the artisan in the course of fulfilling his function as an artisan. However, argues Rabbi Abramsky, a physician who harms rather than heals is not engaged in medical ministration and hence is not functioning in his capacity as an artisan.<sup><xref rid="fn182">63</xref></sup> Hence, according to Ramban, absent a rabbinic decree, even an uncompensated physician would be liable for damages.</p>
<p>However, even conceding that a physician who commits an error is not functioning in his capacity as a physician, that consideration does not seem to explain the physician&#x2019;s liability according to Ramban. There is no reason to assume that an artisan is not liable for damages simply because of the fact that he is an artisan as Rabbi Abramsky seems to imply. Rather, as explained earlier, his immunity from liability is based upon the consideration that he has been granted license to perform the act that caused harm. In effect, his act becomes a licensed tort for which there is no liability as <italic>adam ha-mazik</italic>. The artisan remains liable only for such loss as a bailee is liable by virtue of his duty of care as a bailee.</p>
<p>The problem is resolved somewhat differently and, in this writer&#x2019;s opinion, more cogently by R. Joshua of Kutna, <italic>Yeshu&#x2019;ot Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 25:3. <italic>Yeshu&#x2019;ot Yisra&#x2019;el</italic> asserts that an artisan is immune from liability according to Ramban only because he was granted permission to ply his craft by the owner of the property. However, a physician who performs an unnecessary procedure does not act with the permission of the patient since the patient does not give permission for unnecessary procedures and hence the physician is exonerated only by virtue of rabbinic enactment &#x201C;for the welfare of society.&#x201D; <italic>Yeshu&#x2019;ot Yisra&#x2019;el</italic> apparently maintains that this is also the case in situations in which the patient did not survive the surgery because of &#x201C;weakness;&#x201D; in effect, such a procedure is unwarranted and the patient did not give permission for an unwarranted procedure. That analysis is similar to the earlier-cited distinction between a father or teacher, who are not culpable because they were engaged in discharging a duty, and a physician who, if acting in error, fulfills no obligation and would not apply to a case in which the procedure was appropriate but a mishap occurred in the course of its execution. Accordingly, if the surgery was appropriate but the patient succumbs as a result of inadvertent error committed by the surgeon, Ramban, according to <italic>Yeshu&#x2019;ot Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, would maintain that the surgeon is not to be held liable even absent the consideration of &#x201C;the welfare of society.&#x201D;</p>
<h1>V. <italic>Divergent Positions</italic></h1>
<h3>1. <italic>Rabbenu Nissim</italic></h3>
<p>Rabbenu Nissim (Ran), in his commentary on <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 84b, espouses a view entirely at variance with that of Ramban and <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> and apparently also in contradiction to the rule formulated by the Tosefta. Rabbenu Nissim maintains that a physician is in no way liable for inadvertent error.<sup><xref rid="fn183">64</xref></sup> Rabbenu Nissim explains that &#x201C;when a proficient physician errs in his medical ministrations he is not acting inadvertently (<italic>shogeg</italic>) but out of compulsion (<italic>ones</italic>) for he heals with [divine] authority&#x2026; and he has only that which his eyes see as we say with regard to a judge who has erred, [i.e.], that his heart coerced him.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn184">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the rejection of the view by both Ramban<sup><xref rid="fn185">66</xref></sup> and <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, Ran&#x2019;s position is cited with approbation by the nineteenth-century authority, R. Joseph Saul Nathanson, <italic>Divrei Sha&#x2019;ul</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:1. <italic>Divrei Sha&#x2019;ul</italic> notes, as did <italic>Besamim Rosh</italic> before him, that a person who inadvertently commits a transgression in the course of attempting to fulfill a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> is exempt from the sacrificial offering required for expiation of inadvertent sin. By the same token, asserts <italic>Divrei Sha&#x2019;ul</italic>, it would be reasonable to assume that if a person commits a tort in the course of fulfilling a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> there should be no financial liability in the eyes of Heaven. More significantly, the Gemara, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 84b, establishes that therapeutic &#x201C;wounding&#x201D; is not proscribed by the biblical prohibition against battery. The exclusion of therapeutic &#x201C;wounding&#x201D; is predicated upon a principle of rabbinic exegesis knows as a <italic>hekesh</italic>, i.e., the juxtaposition of two different legal categories, which has the effect of transposing one or more halakhic provisions already established in one of those categories to the other category. In this instance the <italic>hekesh</italic> is based upon the juxtaposition of references to the smiting of an animal and the smiting of a man in Leviticus 24:17-18. The Gemara declares, &#x201C;Just as a person who smites an animal for therapeutic purposes is not liable so also a person who smites a man for therapeutic purposes is not liable.&#x201D; The inference to be drawn from that statement, argues <italic>Divrei Sha&#x2019;ul</italic>, is that a person who inadvertently causes harm in the course of attempting to perform a therapeutic procedure is totally exonerated even in the eyes of Heaven, as is the case with regard to a person who causes harm to an animal in the course of a failed attempt to cure the animal. <italic>Divrei Sha&#x2019;ul</italic> apparently regards the Gemara&#x2019;s formulation of this rule to be at variance with the rule posited by the Tosefta holding the physician accountable at the hands of Heaven and, applying usual canons of halakhic decision-making, <italic>Divrei Sha&#x2019;ul</italic> asserts that the rule formulated by the Gemara should be given preference over that recorded in the Tosefta.<sup><xref rid="fn186">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>As noted earlier, <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:2, rules that a physician is culpable at the hands of Heaven only if he has been remiss in some manner in his treatment of the patient or if he has not been sufficiently diligent in determining the proper treatment. Although his view appears to reflect the position of Rabbenu Nissim, <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> surprisingly asserts that his view reflects his understanding of the Tosefta as well as of the rulings of Ramban and <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Rabbenu Nissim is widely regarded as ruling that the physician is immune to suit for usual forms of medical malpractice, thoughtful application of his position to many common instances of malpractice results in an entirely different conclusion. Rabbenu Nissim&#x2019;s position exonerating a physician from malpractice liability is limited to genuine, albeit avoidable, errors of judgment as reflected in his appeal to the concept of &#x201C;his heart compelled him.&#x201D; A surgeon who removes the wrong organ because he failed to consult the patient&#x2019;s medical chart or who fails to read the label on a vial of medicine and administers a toxic drug has not committed an error of judgment compelled by his intellect.<sup><xref rid="fn187">68</xref></sup> The same is true in the situation of a physician who simply fails to examine a patient properly because of the pressure of time or because of sheer laziness.<sup><xref rid="fn188">69</xref></sup> Those situations represent examples of negligence for which immunity has not been conferred upon the physician. Moreover, according to Rabbenu Nissim, the physician is liable for such forms of negligent malpractice not only &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven&#x201D; but will be held liable by the <italic>bet din</italic> as well. Relief from liability by operation of rabbinic decree is recorded in the Tosefta solely in conjunction with the Tosefta&#x2019;s formulation of a biblical law doctrine of strict liability applicable to a physician. If the Tosefta&#x2019;s position is rejected in favor of the authoritative ruling of the Babylonian Talmud, there is no other evidence pointing to the existence of a rabbinic decree circumscribing the power of a <italic>bet din</italic> to order compensation.<sup><xref rid="fn189">70</xref></sup></p>
<h3>2. <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic></h3>
<h4>(a) Gerama <italic>vs.</italic> Garmi</h4>
<p>R. Zalman Nechemiah Goldberg, <italic>Te&#x1E25;umin</italic>, XIX (5759), 321, asserts that a physician who causes harm by offering poor advice, recommending a harmful procedure or prescribing a medication that is deleterious is liable not simply because of <italic>gerama</italic> but because his act is in the nature of <italic>garmi</italic>. In his initial discussion Rabbi Goldberg expresses some doubt with regard to whether, even according to the ruling of the Tosefta, a physician who incorrectly prescribes a medication, but does not personally administer the drug, bears liability even in the eyes of Heaven. He similarly expresses some doubt with regard to liability at the hands of Heaven with regard to a physician who orders an injection or counsels surgery but does not himself perform the procedure. Nevertheless, he concludes that, at the minimum, such acts constitute <italic>gerama</italic>, or an indirect cause, for which there is liability in the eyes of Heaven. Moreover, Rabbi Goldberg further declares the matter to be analogous to <italic>mesirah</italic>, i.e., &#x201C;informing&#x201D; an evildoer of the location of money or property and thereby enabling the malfeasor to seize the property. Such an act is categorized as <italic>garmi</italic> for which there is complete liability, i.e, for which there is liability not only in the eyes of Heaven but which is actionable before a <italic>bet din</italic> as well.</p>
<p>Jewish law recognizes two distinct forms of indirect causation: <italic>gerama</italic> and <italic>garmi</italic>. Damage caused by <italic>gerama</italic> results in liability only at the hands of Heaven; damage as a result of <italic>garmi</italic> is actionable before a <italic>bet din</italic> despite the absence of proximate cause. The precise nature of the distinction between the categories of <italic>gerama</italic> and <italic>garmi</italic> is the subject of considerable controversy among early-day authorities.<sup><xref rid="fn190">71</xref></sup> In defining the concept of <italic>gerama</italic> in contradistinction to that of <italic>garmi</italic>, <italic>Tosafot</italic>, <italic>Bava Batra</italic> 26b, assert that, when the harm is a necessary and inescapable result of the tortfeasor&#x2019;s act, the tortfeasor is liable even if the resultant damage is caused by the tortfeasor only indirectly.<sup><xref rid="fn191">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>If the physician&#x2019;s referral to the surgeon or his order to the nurse is deemed to be in the nature of <italic>garmi</italic>, the physician would be fully liable but for the immunity conferred upon him by rabbinic edict. In comparing dispensing medical advice with &#x201C;informing&#x201D; and categorizing such conduct as <italic>garmi</italic>, Rabbi Goldberg&#x2019;s theory is based upon the presumption that the specialist&#x2019;s advice will certainly be heeded, i.e., the nurse will obey his orders and the patient will fill the prescription, and is further predicated upon the premise that even an indirect act that will inevitably result in pecuniary harm constitutes actionable <italic>garmi</italic>. There are, however, grounds to question whether erroneously prescribing a medication, ordering an injection or counseling surgery generate liability even at the hands of Heaven. In point of fact, other than perhaps in the case of an order issued to a nurse, it is far from certain that there is a necessary causal relationship between the practitioner&#x2019;s advice and the resultant harm since patients frequently seek second opinions or ignore medical advice.</p>
<p>Quite apart from the foregoing consideration, it would appear that the harm caused by a physician is not in the nature of <italic>garmi</italic>. The relevant paradigm is the case of a person who consults a money-changer (<italic>shul&#x1E25;ani</italic>) with regard to the value of a coin proffered to him. A proficient <italic>shul&#x1E25;ani</italic>, i.e., a master money-changer requiring no further training, who renders an erroneous opinion regarding the value of a coin is not liable for any loss incurred in acceptance of the coin since he has not been negligent in any way. There is a dispute between early-day authorities with regard to whether the money-changer incurs no liability even if the recipient of the coin expressly indicates that he is relying upon the money-changer&#x2019;s opinion.<sup><xref rid="fn192">73</xref></sup> The consensus of opinion is that there is no obligation even under such circumstances.<sup><xref rid="fn193">74</xref></sup> The same rule would apply to a proficient physician who makes a <italic>bona fide</italic> error in prescribing a medication or the like.</p>
<p>Most significantly, as explained by Rosh, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 9:13, liability by virtue of <italic>garmi</italic> is limited to situations in which the harm is immediately consequent upon performance of the culpable act. Since the money-changer&#x2019;s liability in terms of <italic>garmi</italic> is predicated upon the fact that the resultant damage is not only certain to occur but is also immediate, i.e., the proferred coin is immediately accepted in reliance upon the money-changer and the person who presents the coin has no further liability. Accordingly, no such liability would result from the writing of a prescription which must be taken to a pharmacy or from an order directed to a nurse in any situation in which the order is not carried out immediately.</p>
<p>Of course the issue is entirely theoretical since, even if the internist&#x2019;s referral to the surgeon or the physician&#x2019;s order to the nurse constitutes a form of <italic>garmi</italic>, any resulting liability is cancelled by virtue of the rabbinic decree promulgated <italic>mipnei tikkun ha-olam</italic>.</p>
<p>The liability of a nurse who administers an injection at the direction of a physician or of a surgeon who heeds the internist&#x2019;s diagnosis and performs an operation is a separate issue. It would certainly seem that according to the ruling of <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, the nurse and the surgeon are culpable in the eyes of Heaven. Thus it would follow that both the physician and the nurse, as well as the internist and the surgeon, are equally liable, at least in the eyes of Heaven. Rabbi Goldberg, however, seems to imply that liability cannot be shared jointly by the physician and nurse or by both the internist and the surgeon.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that, according to Rabbenu Nissim, it would appear that the nurse and the surgeon are not culpable since they are &#x201C;coerced&#x201D; by the advice they have received and upon which they have every right to rely. Thus, according to Rabbenu Nissim, under such circumstances the nurse or surgeon cannot be deemed liable. Rabbi Goldberg makes a different and more novel point in asserting that the actions of individuals such as the nurse or the surgeon who act upon the advice of a qualified professional are in the nature of an <italic>ones gamur</italic> for which, according to the opinion of <italic>Tosafot</italic>, there is no liability.</p>
<h4>b) Tashba&#x1E93;&#x2019; <italic>Ruling</italic></h4>
<p>In his earlier-cited responsum, <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> draws a distinction between physical intervention in the form of a surgical procedure or the like and the administration of medication, just as he drew such a distinction with regard to exile in instances of inadvertent manslaughter. In support of that distinction <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> asserts that the term &#x201C;<italic>uman</italic>&#x201D; employed by the Tosefta denotes an artisan who employs a sharp instrument and hence all references in the Tosefta are to a surgeon (<italic>rofeh uman</italic>) who heals by means of &#x201C;work of the hand&#x201D; but that a physician who cures the sick by means of potions, laxatives or medicaments is not referred to by the appellation &#x201C;<italic>rofeh uman</italic>.&#x201D; Thus the doctrine of liability formulated by the Tosefta is limited solely to a surgeon whose intervention results in misadventure but does not apply to a physician since the latter&#x2019;s ministration &#x201C;does not enter into the realm of wounding that he be liable for damages. [Therefore] whether [he acts] unintentionally or intentionally and causes death or adds suffering to the sickness, [since] he intended to cure and did not intend to do harm, he is not liable even according to the laws of Heaven.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As explained earlier, the distinction drawn by <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> reflects the halakhic notion of proximate cause.<sup><xref rid="fn194">75</xref></sup> A tortfeasor is liable only for damages that are a direct result of his act; he is not liable for damages he causes only indirectly. Damage to a limb or organ arising from &#x201C;wounding,&#x201D; i.e., surgical incision or excision is clearly direct; harm caused by drugs or medications, even if administered directly by inoculation or the like, is regarded by <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> as indirect.<sup><xref rid="fn195">76</xref></sup> Even those authorities who regard the harm caused by injection or ingestion of a drug to be the direct effect of that cause must concede that merely prescribing, or even handing a patient, a drug can be no more than a <italic>gerama</italic>. That conclusion is evident from the statement of the Gemara, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 47b, describing the act of placing a poison before an animal as a mere <italic>gerama</italic> with the result that, although a person causing such harm is liable &#x201C;according to the laws of Heaven,&#x201D; a <italic>bet din</italic> cannot require compensation.</p>
<p><italic>Tashba&#x1E93;&#x2019;</italic> distinction between a surgeon and a practitioner of internal medicine presents a number of difficulties. As noted earlier, the salient distinction between mere <italic>gerama</italic> and <italic>garmi</italic> is that in instances of <italic>garmi</italic>, despite the absence of proximate cause as defined by Halakhah, the resultant harm is certain to occur. Erroneous injection of a toxic substance, for example, should, in light of the previously cited comments of <italic>Tosafot</italic>, <italic>Bava Batra</italic> 26b, be treated no differently than an error committed in the course of surgery. <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> may well have accepted the position of the early-day authorities who, because of a lack of proximate cause, regard even such harm to be in the category of unactionable <italic>gerama</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn196">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>A close reading of <italic>Tasbaz&#x2019;</italic> comment &#x201C;since [the physician] intended to heal and did not intend to harm,&#x201D; reveals that <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> regards the physician to be free of liability for harm resulting from administration of medication only if the improper medication was administered in error. The implication of that statement is that if the physician intentionally administers a harmful medication he is indeed liable. However, as Rabbi Mordecai Elon, <italic>Torah she-be-al Peh</italic>, XVIII, 74, points out in questioning <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> &#x0301; comment, a tortfeasor is not liable even for intentional damage arising only indirectly from his act.</p>
<p>An even greater difficulty lies in the fact that a tortfeasor is liable in the eyes of Heaven even when the damages result from an act in the nature of <italic>gerama</italic>. Indeed, as recorded by Rema, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 346:3, although the <italic>bet din</italic> is not empowered to order compensation directly and hence may not seize the tortfeasor&#x2019;s property, the <italic>bet din</italic> may nevertheless apply sanctions against the tortfeasor in the form of excommunication in order to prompt him to discharge the obligation that exists in the eyes of Heaven. <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> does not at all explain why a physician should not be held accountable in the eyes of Heaven for malpractice in the form of <italic>gerama</italic>. This difficulty is noted by <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>, III, no. 104, sec. 1.</p>
<p>It seems to this writer that <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic>&#x2019; position should be understood in light of the view expressed by Me&#x2019;iri, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 56a. Me&#x2019;iri maintains that liability &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven&#x201D; in instances of <italic>gerama</italic> is limited to situations in which the tortfeasor &#x201C;intends to do harm.&#x201D; Thus, the physician, even if he has erred in his ministrations, certainly did not intend to cause harm and hence he incurs no liability even &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven.&#x201D; Indeed, <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> qualifies the scope of his ruling by describing the salutary intention of the physician to heal and adds the phrase &#x201C;and he did not intend to do harm.&#x201D; If <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> maintains, as did Me&#x2019;iri before him, that liability for <italic>gerama</italic> &#x201C;in the eyes of Heaven&#x201D; is limited to situations in which there is intention to do harm, the incorporation of that phrase seems to explain why the physician&#x2019;s act, unlike other forms of <italic>gerama</italic>, does not result in culpability in the eyes of Heaven.</p>
<p>R. Chaim Joseph David Azulai, <italic>Birkei Yosef</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:7, notes that, in affirming the physician&#x2019;s liability in the eyes of Heaven, both Ramban and <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> are apparently in disagreement with <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic>, since they do not in any way qualify or limit their assertion that the physician is liable in the eyes of Heaven. In light of the foregoing discussion it is not difficult to explain why those authorities maintain that the physician is liable in the eyes of Heaven even in instances of <italic>gerama</italic>. Moreover, there are numerous authorities who maintain that harm caused by administration of medication must be regarded as direct rather than as indirect.<sup><xref rid="fn197">78</xref></sup> Nevertheless, <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, IV, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 151, comments that &#x201C;it is difficult&#x201D; to dispute <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;&#x2019;</italic> opinion or to rule contrary to the position of <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn198">79</xref></sup></p>
<h1>VI. <italic>Liability as a Bailee</italic></h1>
<p>R. Meir Auerbach, <italic>Imrei Binah</italic>, II, <italic>Dinei Dayyanim</italic>, no. 30, accepts <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;&#x2019;</italic> distinction insofar as tort liability is concerned in principle but does not agree that either the Tosefta or Ramban intended to draw such a distinction. Nevertheless, argues <italic>Imrei Binah</italic>, although in the absence of proximate cause there may be no tort liability, the physician is also a bailee and is liable for violation of his duties as a bailee. The rule with regard to an artisan is that an artisan who receives no compensation is a gratuitous bailee with regard to any property entrusted to him in the practice of his craft. However, as stated in the Mishnah, <italic>Bava Me&#x1E93;i&#x2019;a</italic> 80b, if the artisan is compensated for his services, his status is that of a bailee for hire. A gratuitous bailee is liable only if he is negligent; a bailee for hire is liable for any loss except that which occurs through <italic>ones</italic>. <italic>Imrei Binah</italic> notes that physicians are generally compensated for their services. When compensated, writes <italic>Imrei Binah</italic>, a physician has the status of a bailee for hire.<sup><xref rid="fn199">80</xref></sup> Thus, even if he has not been negligent, the physician should be liable for any harm that he causes, even if he causes such harm only indirectly, unless the harm is in the nature of <italic>ones</italic>. In exempting the physician from financial liability, the Sages, <italic>ipso facto</italic>, exempted him not only from tort liability but also from liability as a bailee. However, since that exemption is only from liability imposed by a <italic>bet din</italic>, the physician remains liable in the eyes of Heaven even for damage caused indirectly, albeit not as a tortfeasor, but as a bailee.</p>
<p><italic>Imrei Binah&#x2019;s</italic> thesis presents a number of difficulties:</p>
<p>1) A bailee for hire, as <italic>Imrei Binah</italic> notes in a different context, becomes liable only upon receiving payment in advance or upon taking custody of the bailment by means of formal <italic>kinyan</italic>, e.g., by means of lifting or moving the object. A physician enters into no such <italic>kinyan</italic> and is generally not paid for his services before they are rendered. That objection may be resolved on the basis of a comment of Ramban cited by <italic>Nimukei Yosef</italic>, <italic>Bava Me&#x1E93;i&#x2019;a</italic> 94b. Ramban states that a <italic>kinyan</italic> is necessary solely in order to demonstrate that the bailed object has been accepted as a bailment by the bailee and that he has assumed the obligations of a bailee. An artisan who acquires the status of a bailee does so by commencing his labor; for the artisan, commencement of his work is, in effect, commencement of the bailment. Accordingly, the physician, if he has the status of a bailee, acquires that status immediately upon commencement of medical ministration.</p>
<p>2) As recorded in Exodus 22:14, a bailee is not liable in situations in which the bailor accompanies his property at the inception of the bailment and is himself in a position to participate in the safeguarding of his property. Granted that the patient has the status of a bailed item, the patient, who is also the bailor, is physically present during treatment<sup><xref rid="fn200">81</xref></sup> and indeed is present at the time that the harm occurs.<sup><xref rid="fn201">82</xref></sup> That factor would serve to exonerate the physician from liability as a bailee.</p>
<p>3) The most complex problem is <italic>Imrei Binah&#x2019;s</italic> assumption that a human being can be bailed and that the obligation of a bailee can extend to a physician who assumes a duty of care <italic>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</italic> a patient. The general rule, recorded by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Sekhirut</italic> 2:1, is that a bailee incurs no disability with regard to real property, slaves or promissory notes. As will be shown, there are authorities who regard not only slaves but all human beings as not subject to bailment.</p>
<p>Although Ra&#x2019;avad disagrees, Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Sekhirut</italic> 2:3, maintains that a bailee, although exempt from liability in the event of damage resulting from other causes, nevertheless remains liable for negligence even with regard to real property, slaves and legal instruments. However, even according to Rambam, physicians might be held accountable according to the &#x201C;laws of Heaven&#x201D; only if the harm suffered by the patient results from the physician&#x2019;s negligence, whereas Ramban and <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> apparently assign such liability even in the absence of negligence.</p>
<p>Moreover, the status of a human being as a bailed object for purposes of liability under the laws of bailment is far from clear.<sup><xref rid="fn202">83</xref></sup> Among early-day authorities, Rashi, <italic>Kiddushin</italic> 7a, s.v. <italic>sheyesh lahem a&#x1E25;arayut</italic>, states clearly that all human beings have the halakhic status of real property in this regard.<sup><xref rid="fn203">84</xref></sup> However, <italic>Tosafot</italic>, <italic>ad. locum</italic>, s.v. <italic>im ken</italic>, followed by Ramban, Rashba and Ritva, <italic>ad locum</italic>, take issue with Rashi<sup><xref rid="fn204">85</xref></sup> and declare that the principle is limited to Canaanite slaves.<sup><xref rid="fn205">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among latter-day authorities, R. Jonathan Eibeschutz, <italic>Urim ve-Tumim</italic>, <italic>Tumim</italic> 95:7, maintains that only slaves have the status of real property. Adopting a somewhat different position, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic>, 227:19, implies that a Hebrew slave and an employee contracted for his services also have that status but that a freeman does not. However, <italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 95:17, rules in accordance with the view of Rashi in extending that status to all human beings. Hence, whether or not a patient has the status of real property and, consequently, whether a patient can or cannot be the subject of a bailee&#x2019;s liability is a matter of considerable controversy among both early-day and latter-day authorities.<sup><xref rid="fn206">87</xref></sup></p>
<h1>VI. <italic>A Concluding Comment</italic></h1>
<p>The physician, far more so than the practitioner of any other profession, must maintain constant and uninterrupted vigilance. Any momentary lapse on his part can lead to disastrous consequences. The physician&#x2019;s responsibilities are awesome and indeed they strain the limits of human capability. He or she cannot possibly maintain ongoing vigilance without a firm and dedicated resolve to do so and even then the physician must rely upon divine assistance. As expressed in the final section of the &#x201C;Daily Prayer of a Physician,&#x201D; attributed (probably spuriously) to Rambam, the physician must constantly pray:</p>
<p align="blockquote">Illumine my mind that it recognize what presents itself and that it may comprehend what is absent or hidden. Let it not fail to see what is visible but do not permit it to arrogate to itself the power to see what cannot be seen, for delicate and indefinite are the bounds of the great art of caring for the lives and health of Your creatures. Let me never be absent-minded. May no strange thoughts divert my attention at the bedside of the sick or disturb my mind in its silent labors, for great and sacred are the thoughtful deliberations required to preserve the lives and health of Your creatures.<sup><xref rid="fn207">88</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn128">9. There is a significant disagreement among early-day authorities with regard to the nature of the activity undertaken by the agent of the <italic>bet din</italic> that, when it results in unforeseen death, is not punishable by exile. Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 5:16, codifies the rule formulated in the Mishnah as applicable to a bailiff who seeks to compel a litigant to appear before the court. Ra&#x2019;avad, <italic>ad locum</italic>, disagrees and asserts that the reference in the Mishnah is to an agent of the court who administers the punishment of flogging. Rabbenu Yonatan of Lunel limits the agent&#x2019;s immunity from exile to situations in which the judges erred in ordering more than the appropriate number of lashes and the agent simply carried out their instruction. R. Jacob Reischer, <italic>Teshuvot Shevut Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>, III, no. 140, understands Ra&#x2019;avad as adopting that position as well. However, Ramban, <italic>Makkot</italic> 8a, apparently understands the reference to be to an agent of the <italic>bet din</italic> who administers the proper number of lashes as determined by the <italic>bet din</italic> in accordance with the transgressor&#x2019;s physical condition but who nevertheless causes the death of the transgressor. See also R. Jacob Ettlinger, <italic>Arukh la-Ner, Makkot</italic> 22b; R. Zevi Alexander Halperin, <italic>Imrei ha-&#x1E92;evi</italic>, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 32b; and R.

<ftnote id="fn129">10. The identical rule with regard to both a messenger of the court and a physician is also formulated in the Tosefta, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 9:3.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn132">13. R. Judah Ayash, <italic>Matteh Yehudah, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336, advances the curious view that, in actuality, the culpability of a physician is no greater than that of a father or teacher and hence the exile referred to by the Tosefta and <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> is not statutory in nature but a voluntary undertaking &#x201C;in order to satisfy the requirements of Heaven.&#x201D;</ftnote>

David Pardo, <italic>Shoshanim le-David</italic>, <italic>Makkot</italic> 8a, points out that the first rule enumerated in the Mishnah and Abba Saul&#x2019;s rule are derived from different words in the verse. The first rule is derived from the word &#x201C;<italic>ya&#x2019;ar</italic>&#x201D; while, as explained in the Gemara, <italic>Makkot</italic> 8a, Abba Saul derives his rule from the word &#x201C;<italic>asher</italic>&#x201D; that, in this context, is rendered as &#x201C;if&#x201D; and thus, according to Abba Saul, the verse should be rendered &#x201C;and if a person goes with his friend into a forest.&#x201D; The term &#x201C;if&#x201D; in this context is understood as having the connotation that the slayer&#x2019;s presence is discretionary. <italic>Shoshanim le-David</italic> further points out that Abba Saul&#x2019;s rule is subsumed in the Mishnah&#x2019;s earlier statement: Culpability is assessed only if the slayer had no right to be in the victim&#x2019;s domain. The individual seeking to fulfill a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> has an obligation to enter the domain of the victim. On the basis of that argument it should follow that Abba Saul may indeed disagree in rejecting the broader exclusion of the author of the first statement of the Mishnah but that Abba Saul&#x2019;s rule is accepted by all: If permission of the householder to be present in his courtyard is sufficient to exonerate the slayer from the penalty of exile, <italic>a fortiori</italic>, divine dispensation to engage in an act that results in misadventure must be sufficient to exonerate a person who does so from the penalty of exile.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn138">19. Students of Plato will hear in these words an echo of Plato&#x2019;s comments in his <italic>Republic</italic>, I, 340.

By way of example Plato comments that, at the moment that a physician makes a mistake in treating his patient, he cannot, properly speaking, be called a physician.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn139">20. See R. Gershon Koblentz, <italic>Kiryat &#x1E24;annah</italic>, no. 22, who distinguishes between chastisement that may legitimately be administrated by a father and force used by a teacher to correct a student. The latter may utilize only &#x201C;a small strap&#x201D; in order to impose discipline whereas the father, whose corrections go beyond assuring that the child is attentive, may engage in corporal punishment. Hence, the Mishnah speaks of a father who &#x201C;beats&#x201D; his son in contradistinction to a teacher who may only &#x201C;strike&#x201D; a pupil. According to <italic>Kiryat &#x1E24;annah</italic>, a teacher who employs excessive force does not therein fulfill a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> and hence, if the child dies as a result, the teacher is exiled. That position is consistent with the comment of <italic>Besamim Rosh</italic>; cf., however, R. Joshua of Kutna, <italic>Teshuvot Yeshu&#x2019;ot Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 25:3, cited <italic>infra</italic>, note 22.</ftnote>
<ftnote>For a fuller discussion of appropriate versus inappropriate forms of chastisement see R. Ya&#x2019;akov Meir Stern, <italic>Imrei Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> (Bnei Brak, 5756), <italic>Bi&#x2019;urim</italic>, pp. 39-43.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn140">21. See <italic>infra</italic>, notes 49 and 50 and accompanying text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn141">22. Teshuvot <italic>Yeshu&#x2019;ot Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 25:3, formulates the distinction in a somewhat different manner: The father and the teacher commenced their act in an entirely legitimate manner; only later, in not curtailing the chastisement, did they apply excessive force. Hence, they are not punished by exile. In effect, asserts <italic>Yeshu&#x2019;ot Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, since the battery is privileged, they are immune to punishment despite their abuse of the privilege. The physician, on the other hand, erred in the first instance in attempting to amputate a limb or in making an incision. From its very inception, his act served to fulfill no <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> and hence was not privileged. It would seem to follow that, according to <italic>Yeshu&#x2019;ot Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, the case of a surgeon who correctly commences a procedure but, for example, later negligently nicks an artery and thereby causes the death of his patient is analogous to the case of the father and the teacher and, in such instances, the physician is not punished by exile. R. Shlomoh Zalman Auerbach, as cited by Abraham S. Abraham, <italic>Nishmat Avraham</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:1, note 7, makes much the same point in suggesting that the physician is liable to exile only if his act was not at all appropriate, e.g., he made a surgical incision in the wrong site, in which case he was not at all engaged in a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>. If, however, he commences a procedure that is indeed therapeutic but errs in assessing its execution his situation is comparable to that of a father or teacher who errs in assessing the proper measure of chastisement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn142">23. The third example of an individual who is forced to go into exile offered by the Tosefta, i.e., a messenger of the <italic>bet din</italic> who causes death, remains somewhat problematic since the act of the agent of the <italic>bet din</italic> seems to be analogous to that of a father or a teacher and indeed Abba Saul, as recorded in the Mishnah, explicitly exempts such an official from exile. Nevertheless, the Tosefta may be understood as referring to an agent of the <italic>bet din</italic> who erroneously administers more than the prescribed number of lashes. In no way does the additional stroke of the lash constitute fulfillment of a duty. Accordingly, Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Sanhedrin</italic> 16:2, rules that under such circumstances the messenger is liable to the punishment of exile. See <italic>O&#x1E93;ar Mefarashei ha-Talmud</italic>, p. 351, note 20. Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 5:5, understands Abba Saul&#x2019;s exemption of the agent of the <italic>bet din</italic> from exile as applying to the case of a messenger who uses physical force to compel the appearance of a person summoned by the <italic>bet din</italic>. That situation is comparable to the case of the father or teacher in that the messenger is indeed properly discharging a duty incumbent upon him.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn148">29. In explaining why false witnesses whose testimony leads not only to conviction but to actual execution are not put to death, Ramban, <italic>Commentary on the Bible</italic>, Deuteronomy 19:19, asserts that God does not abandon the totally guiltless and, moreover, God Himself participates in the judgment of the court.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn150">31. The literal import of the verse is an admonition not to impose more than the prescribed number of lashes in punishing a miscreant. According to the Oral Law tradition the prohibition applies <italic>a fortiori</italic> to beating or &#x201C;wounding&#x201D; an innocent person.

For a survey of the various opinions regarding this question see <italic>Encyclopedia Talmudit</italic>, VII (Jerusalem, 5716), 395-396. It is indeed the case that Ramban, as cited by <italic>Teshuvot Rivash</italic>, no. 392, rejects self-help as a remedy with regard to an obligation &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven.&#x201D; However, Ramban&#x2019;s comment is limited to situations in which the plaintiff asserts a claim certain and the defendant professes ignorance. In such a situation the nature of the obligation &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven&#x201D; is to abjure tainted funds. But if the claim is false there can be no obligation even &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven.&#x201D; Since in such a case no evidence is offered in support of the claim, Ramban maintains that self-help is not available. It cannot be deduced from that position that self-help is not a legitimate remedy in situations in which the obligation in the eyes of Heaven is a certainty.</ftnote>
<ftnote>It is further arguable that the opinion of the authorities who maintain that self-help is of no avail is limited to situations in which the obligation, by virtue of its nature, is only in the eyes of Heaven but not to the situation addressed by Ramban in which, according to the analysis presented herein, the claim is fully actionable according to biblical law but the victim is non-suited by rabbinic decree &#x201C;for the benefit of the universe.&#x201D; In such instances it might well be maintained that the rabbinic decree merely constrains the <italic>bet din</italic> but does not extinguish underlying liability and hence self-help may be warranted.</ftnote>

See, however, <italic>infra</italic>, section III.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn161">42. This analysis assumes that the blood-avenger has license to seek vengeance but is not engaged in a form of extra-judicial punishment. Cf., however, <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic>, <italic>Hilkhot Melakhim</italic> 3:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote>An interesting question presents itself in the case of a physician who inadvertently causes the death of a Canaanite slave. Canaanite slaves have no halakhically recognized biological relatives; hence a Canaanite slave can have no blood-avenger. If, as Ramban is herein understood, the physician is not subject to punishment and requires no expiation, a physician who causes the death of a Canaanite slave should be exempt from exile since he is not at risk of vengeance at the hands of the blood-avenger. Cf., <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic>, <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 6:12.</ftnote>
<ftnote>It cannot be countered that the regulations pertaining to exile are rules of general application that do not admit exceptions. Although it is the case that they do not admit of <italic>ad hoc</italic> exceptions, e.g., in the case of a particular individual, such as a proselyte who does not happen to have a blood relative, they do admit of exceptions in instances in which a particular concern cannot possibly be manifest. For example, a resident-alien is not subject to exile because he is not thereby granted immunity from the blood-avenger. Nevertheless, as recorded by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 5:3, a resident-alien who causes the death of a Canaanite slave is exiled even though the Canaanite slave cannot possibly have a blood-avenger; in that instance, exile is required for purposes of expiation. See <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic>, <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 6:12. In light of the herein presented understanding of Ramban, it stands to reason that a physician who causes the death of a Canaanite slave should be exempt from exile since he requires neither expiation nor refuge from the blood-avenger.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn162">43. Nor does it flow necessarily from the distinction drawn by <italic>Yeshu&#x2019;ot Yisra&#x2019;el</italic> and R. Shlomoh Zalman Auerbach, cited <italic>supra</italic>, note 21. Nevertheless, Rabbi Auerbach asserts that a physician is liable to exile only if the patient&#x2019;s death results from an error in judgment. See <italic>Nishmat Avraham</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 376:1, note 1.</ftnote>

See <italic>Teshuvot Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>, III, no. 104, sec. 1, who understands <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic>&#x2019; distinction as reflecting this consideration. However, R. Yitzchak Zilberstein, <italic>Halakhah u-Refu&#x2019;ah</italic>, ed. R. Moshe Hershler, II (Jerusalem, 5741), 288, [reprinted with minor additions in <italic>Emek Halakhah: Assia</italic>, ed. R. Mordecai Halperin (Jerusalem, 5746), p. 131], understands the distinction as reflecting an entirely different concept. Rabbi Zilberstein asserts that <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> is distinguishing between <italic>bona fide</italic> error and negligence: the internist diagnoses and provides treatment in accordance with his assessment of the malady; the surgeon of whom <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> speaks harms the patient as a result of negligent cutting. Hence, he asserts, a surgeon cannot be held culpable for honest misdiagnosis that leads him to perform an unnecessary surgical procedure. If so, <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic>&#x2019; comments are simply the harbinger of the position later advanced by <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, Rabbi Auerbach and <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>. Needless to say, if such a distinction were indeed intended by <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> he would have been expected expressly to indicate that the surgeon is not liable in any and all circumstances.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn169">50. R. Chaim Joseph David Azulai, <italic>Birkei Yosef</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:8, cites <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;&#x2019;</italic> ruling but notes that neither Ramban nor Tur nor <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> makes such a distinction and suggests that <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;&#x2019;</italic> position is open to rebuttal. A point similar to that of <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> is made by R. Jacob Schorr in a responsum published in <italic>Teshuvot Ge&#x2019;onei Batra&#x2019;i</italic> (Prague, 5576), no. 6, a compendium edited by <italic>Sha&#x2019;agat Aryeh</italic>. R. Judah Ayash, <italic>Teshuvot Bet Yehudah</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, no. 14, maintains that abortion induced by chemical potions is rabbinically forbidden whereas direct destruction of the fetus is biblically proscribed. See also R. Ovadiah Yosef, <italic>Yabi&#x2019;a Omer</italic>, IV, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, no. 1, sec. 5. Cf., R. Eliezer Waldenberg, <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic>, VIII, no. 36, who fails to make this distinction but who indicates elsewhere, <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic>, IX, no. 51, <italic>sha&#x2019;ar</italic> 3, chap. 3, sec. 11 and <italic>sikum</italic>, sec. 16, that, when termination of pregnancy is permissible, it is preferable to induce abortion by chemical means.</ftnote>

Cf., <italic>Teshuvot Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>, III, no. 104, sec. 1, who suggests that <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> sought to exclude the possibility of some other supervening cause of death. <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak&#x2019;s</italic> further suggestion that an act of <italic>garmi</italic> constitutes capital homicide is rather novel.</ftnote>

<ftnote><italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> may perhaps be understood as accepting the view postulated by <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> to the effect that the physician is subject to exile only in cases of negligence. See Rabbi Zilberstein, <italic>Halakhah u-Refu&#x2019;ah</italic>, p. 293 and <italic>Emek Halakhah,</italic> p. 135. However, the terminology employed by <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, <italic>viz.</italic>, &#x201C;for indeed the Sages exempted a physician who causes the death of a patient&#x201D; would seem to indicate an explicit, rather than an inferential, exemption.</ftnote>
<ftnote>R. Zevi Spitz, <italic>Mishpetei ha-Torah</italic>, I, no.12, note 3, seems to follow <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> in assuming that a physician is liable to exile only if he is negligent. He then proceeds to argue that a physician is held to a higher standard of care than is a layman, <italic>viz.</italic>, while treating his patient the physician must remain calm and collected. Hence a physician who panics or acts precipitously is liable to exile whereas the woman in question was exonerated by <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, claims Rabbi Spitz, because her state of excitement rendered her act non-negligent in nature. It should be noted that <italic>Rav Pe&#x2019;alim</italic> pointedly states that the woman, who was surely aware of the presence of the poisonous substance in proximity to the whiskey, was negligent in not inspecting the flask. Moreover, Halakhah does not follow community standards in assessing negligence. If panic vitiates negligence, it does so for a physician no less so than for a layman. In addition, Rabbi Spitz overlooks the most significant point, <italic>viz.</italic>, in <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic>, no. 184, <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> declares that even a physician is exempt from exile.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn172">53. R. Menachem Azariah Meir Castelenuovo, <italic>Misgeret ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:1, declares that only if the physician &#x201C;errs&#x201D; is he exonerated but if he has been negligent in any manner he is culpable because &#x201C;negligence is close to intent.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn173">54. The contention of R. Moshe Ze&#x2019;ev Zorger, <italic>Va-Yashev Mosheh</italic>, II, no. 8 sec. 2, that the concept &#x201C;<italic>mipnei tikkun ha-olam</italic>&#x201D; is adduced by the Tosefta, not to explain conferral of immunity upon the physician in instances of negligence, but to explain why there is actionable liability in cases of purposeful malpractice is untenable. <italic>Va-Yashev Mosheh</italic> suggests that the harm caused by the physician is a <italic>hezek she-eino nikkar</italic>, i.e., the harm is not physically perceivable as, for example, is the case with regard to damage inflicted in defiling a foodstuff. Harms of that nature are not actionable other than on the basis of rabbinic decree. That principle cannot be applied in instances of malpractice since, assuredly, physical harm resulting from malpractice is recognizable. Cf., R. Mordecai Elon, <italic>Torah she-be-al Peh</italic>, XVIII (Jerusalem, 5737), 75.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn174">55. <italic>Misgeret ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 336:1, similarly declares that only if the physician &#x201C;errs&#x201D; is he exonerated but if he has been &#x201C;negligent in any manner&#x201D; he is liable because &#x201C;negligence is close to intent.&#x201D; See <italic>supra</italic>, note 53. <italic>Misgeret ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> seems to assert that <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> would concede that, if the physician made a factual error because of failure to master the appropriate medical information, the physician is liable. It would follow that <italic>Misgeret ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> understands gross negligence to be included in <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;&#x2019;</italic> concept of intentional harm but has a broader view of the definition of gross negligence than is found in other sources. According to <italic>Misgeret ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> the concept includes not only carelessness in performing an act but also undertaking an act one is not qualified to perform.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn175">56. <italic>Shevet ha-Levi&#x2019;s</italic> understanding of <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> is probably also shared by R. Chaim Joseph David Azulai, <italic>Tov Ayin</italic>, no. 9, sec. 8. <italic>Tov Ayin</italic> quotes <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> and comments that, according to all authorities, it is possible that, if the physician did not properly diagnose the illness and therefore prescribed a drug that caused the patient&#x2019;s death, he is liable &#x201C;because it was possible for him to reflect and to be accurate.&#x201D; <italic>Tov Ayin</italic> apparently understands the &#x201C;willfulness&#x201D; to which <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> refers as reflective of a rather broad concept. Conceptually, however, it is readily understandable that the Sages did not seek to excuse the physician from liability in instances of gross negligence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn176">57. Cf., <italic>Va-Yashev Mosheh</italic>, II, no. 8, sec. 3, who takes issue with <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> and asserts that the phrase &#x201C;more than is proper&#x201D; connotes <italic>hitrashlut</italic>, i.e., laziness or inattention.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn177">58. In all cases in which the physician denies negligence there is a significant question with regard to which party bears the burden of proof. Does the patient have the burden in conformity with the general rule that burden of proof is on the plaintiff or, since the act has certainly been committed, is absence of negligence merely an affirmative defense with the burden of proof upon the putative tortfeasor? See <italic>Olat Shmu&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 73; R.

<ftnote>Rabbi Mordecai Elon, <italic>Torah she-be-al Peh</italic>, XVIII, 73f., develops a theory according to which Ramban would regard an artisan who is compensated for his services as exempt only from liability for damage to property but not from harm to another individual&#x2019;s person.

Presumably, that individual was licensed by the <italic>bet din</italic> because the <italic>bet din</italic> erroneously believed him to be a qualified practitioner. The same position is espoused by R. Moses Mat of Premishla (Przemysl) in his <italic>Matteh Mosheh</italic>, part V, chapter 3. According to this view, it is only an unqualified physician who, although exonerated by the <italic>bet din</italic> because of his licensure, remains guilty in the eyes of Heaven whereas a qualified and properly licensed physician is absolved from liability even in the eyes of Heaven if he causes damage inadvertently. <italic>Ramat Ra&#x1E25;el</italic>, no. 23, sec. 3, rather implausibly suggests that this position can be read into the words of <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> as well.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn184">65. <italic>Tosafot</italic> cannot be understood as accepting the notion that &#x201C;his heart coerced him&#x201D; as constituting, not simply an <italic>ones</italic>, but an <italic>ones gamur</italic> for which there is no liability since, were that so, there would be no liability even &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven&#x201D; as posited by the Tosefta.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn198">79. <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> cites <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;&#x2019;</italic> employment of the phrase &#x201C;for [the physician] has only that which his eyes see&#x201D; in support of a caveat to the effect that <italic>Tashba&#x1E93;</italic> ruling does not apply in situations in which the error would have been avoided had an x-ray examination been undertaken. However, that conclusion is simply unwarranted. Cf., <italic>Va-Yashev Mosheh</italic>, II, no. 8, sec. 3. <italic>Shevet ha-Levi&#x2019;s</italic> comment might be cogent in elucidating Rabbenu Nissim&#x2019;s position but for the fact that a <italic>bona fide</italic> error in deciding that x-rays are superfluous (and, if so, to be avoided for sound medical reasons) is also within the category of &#x201C;his heart compelled him.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn199">80. It may be argued that even a physician who receives no remuneration for his services has the status of a bailee for hire. The Gemara (<italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 56b; <italic>Bava Me&#x1E93;i&#x2019;a</italic> 29a and 82a; <italic>Shevu&#x2019;ot</italic> 44a; and <italic>Nedarim</italic> 33b) records a controversy between Rabbah and Rav Yosef with regard to whether a person engaged in restoring lost property has the status of a gratuitous bailee or of a bailee for hire. Rav Yosef maintains that since the finder is engaged in fulfilling a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> he is exempt from discharging other obligations and hence enjoys the tangible benefit of not being required to bestow even minimal alms upon a mendicant. That dispute is mirrored in a controversy recorded by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> and Rema, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 267:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote>The Gemara, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 73a, declares that the obligation to restore lost property entails, a <italic>fortiori</italic>, an obligation to prevent loss of life. Rambam, <italic>Commentary on the Mishnah</italic>, <italic>Nedarim</italic> 4:4, states that a physician is obligated to treat a patient by virtue of that commandment. Hence, it should follow that a physician, assuming he is a bailee, is similarly exempt from the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> of charity while treating patients. Therefore, according to the earlier-cited opinion with regard to the status of the finder of lost property, he should have the status of a bailee for hire even if he is not compensated for his services.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Similarly, although <italic>Imrei Binah</italic> presents a detailed analysis of the category of bailment ascribed to a <italic>dayyan</italic>, he fails to analyze the possible status of every physician as a bailee for hire. One argument made by <italic>Imrei Binah</italic> with regard to a <italic>dayyan</italic>, <italic>viz.</italic>, that while committing an error he performs no <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> and hence is not exempt from the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> of charity may be applicable to the physician as well. Cf., <italic>supra</italic>, note 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn200">81. As stated by Ra&#x2019;avad in a gloss to a ruling of Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Sekhirut</italic> 2:1, presence of the owner does not serve to exonerate the bailee from liability in tort. This is true despite the ostensibly contradictory ruling of Ra&#x2019;avad, <italic>Hilkhot Ishut</italic> 21:9, declaring that, by virtue of the husband&#x2019;s presence in the home, a housewife is exempt from liability for household utensils that she may break. The housewife, however, is exempt from tort liability because she has the status of an artisan and an artisan who labors with permission of his or her client is not liable in tort for unintentional damage.

<ftnote>It should be noted that R.

Cf., however, <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic>, <italic>Hilkhot To&#x2019;en ve-Nit&#x2019;an</italic> 5:2. It should also be noted that R. Akiva Eger in his glosses to <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 6:2 and in his responsa, <italic>Teshuvot R. Akiva Eger</italic>, no. 51, upon analyzing the ruling of <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, arrives at a conclusion that is at variance with that of <italic>Shakh</italic> and maintains that only a Canaanite slave has the status of real property. Cf., <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic>, <italic>Hilkhot Gerushin</italic> 1:6, who resolves the difficulties identified by R. Akiva Eger in a different manner.

<h1><italic>Choosing Between Therapies: A Painful Dilemma</italic></h1>
<p>The widely-acclaimed Jerusalem Institute of Technology, of which the late R. Shlomoh Zalman Auerbach was a guiding spirit, has, for the past number of years, been compiling and publishing an annual volume of essays devoted to topical halakhic issues pertaining to technology and medicine. Those volumes, bearing the title <italic>Ateret Shlomoh</italic>, are published in memory of Rabbi Auerbach.</p>
<p>Volume IV (Adar 5759) of that series features an article by the highly regarded head of the Institute, R. Levi Yitzchak Halperin, devoted to a heart-wrenching medical problem. The hypothetical case involves a child afflicted with a malignant brain tumor that would almost certainly be fatal if left untreated. The tumor in question can be treated in one of two ways: 1) Chemotherapy can be used in treating this form of cancer and will be successful in approximately 60&#x0025; of all cases. 2) The tumor can also be treated by whole-brain radiation which is effective in virtually all cases. The problem with the latter form of treatment is that, in a pediatric patient whose brain is not fully developed, there is a strong likelihood that the patient will suffer loss of neural function so severe that it will render the child a <italic>shoteh</italic>; i.e., the child will suffer extreme mental retardation. For purposes of analyzing the problem it must be assumed that radiation cannot be held in abeyance until it is determined whether or not chemotherapy will be successful.</p>
<p>Assuming that there is no cogent reason to fear that radiation poses a risk of foreshortening life, there is little question that, were radiation the sole therapy available, it would be obligatory to treat the patient in that manner even were resultant severe mental retardation to be a certainty. The issue in the case described is whether a statistically less efficacious therapy may be employed in the hope of not compromising quality of life.</p>
<p>This writer has consulted a number of medical specialists in the fields of pediatrics, oncology, neurology and radiology in an attempt to identify the type of tumor for which these possible modes of therapy are accompanied by the statistical risks described. That effort did not meet with success. It must be presumed that the discussion refers to a hypothetical situation. The fact that, as presented, the dilemma is not actual in no way diminishes the importance of the issue involved. The halakhic principles to be applied are applicable in many other situations as well.</p>
<p>Rabbi Halperin frames the question in terms of the consideration that it will become impossible for the mentally incompetent patient to perform <italic>mi&#x1E93;vot</italic>. Framed in those terms, the issue is whether or not a person may accept a significant degree of risk, not in order to effect a cure, but to be assured of the ability to perform <italic>mi&#x1E93;vot</italic>. The broader question is whether a person may accept a significant degree of risk in order to improve, or prevent a deterioration of, quality of life. The dilemma as posed by Rabbi Halperin is whether severe mental retardation must be accepted as the cost of improving chances of survival. The broader question is whether severe physical incapacity such as, for example, paralysis or blindness, must be accepted as the cost of improving chances of survival.</p>
<p>Rabbi Halperin tentatively suggests that there may be no obligation of rescue in situations in which the person whose life is saved will remain mentally incompetent. The Gemara, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 73a, bases the obligation to preserve the life of one&#x2019;s fellow upon the obligation to return lost property: Since a person is obligated to return lost property, <italic>a fortiori</italic>, he must be obligated to restore a person&#x2019;s life no less so than he is obligated to restore that person&#x2019;s property. However, as recorded in <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 261:4, there is no obligation to restore the property of a person who willfully abandons or attempts to destroy his property. The fact that the Gemara derives the obligation of rescue from the obligation to restore lost property prompted <italic>Min&#x1E25;at &#x1E24;innukh</italic>, <italic>Kome&#x1E93; Min&#x1E25;ah</italic>, no. 237, and R. Yerucham Perla, in <italic>Mahari Perla</italic>, his commentary on R. Sa&#x2019;adia Ga&#x2019;on&#x2019;s <italic>Sefer ha-Mi&#x1E93;vot</italic>, <italic>mi&#x1E93;vot aseh</italic>, no. 28, s.v. <italic>u-milevad zeh</italic>, to reach the astonishing conclusion that there is no obligation to intervene in order to prevent a would-be suicide.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, but on the basis of the same line of reasoning, R. Shlomoh Kluger, <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Shlomoh</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 426:1, asserts that there is no obligation to save one&#x2019;s fellow from imminent death if the act of rescue would involve humiliation or embarrassment to the rescuer. <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Shlomoh</italic> argues that the exemption from taking custody of and returning lost property in such circumstances extends to preservation of life.<sup><xref rid="fn208">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Halperin applies a similar parallelism in the medical context. The Gemara, <italic>Bava Me&#x1E93;i&#x2019;a</italic> 30b, establishes that a person must trouble himself to return another person&#x2019;s property only in situations in which he would devote similar time and expend similar effort in preserving his own property. Apparently assuming that the same exemption exists in a situation in which the owner of the property would not deem it worth his while to preserve his own property, argues Rabbi Halperin, there is no obligation to provide life-prolonging treatment for a person who does not wish to live. Such an individual would not seek to preserve his own life; hence, argues Rabbi Halperin, according to the earlier-cited authorities, it is not incumbent upon others to do so on his behalf.<sup><xref rid="fn209">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>That argument fails for a number of reasons. A person has no obligation to prevent his property from becoming destroyed. The prohibition of <italic>bal tash&#x1E25;it</italic>, i.e., wasteful or wanton destruction of property, prohibits only wanton acts of destruction but does not mandate conservation of resources. Hence, a person may legitimately decline to preserve property facing imminent destruction, particularly when intervention would involve expenditure of time and effort not commensurate with the value of the endangered property. Not so with regard to life. According to Rabbenu Nissim, a person is under obligation to preserve his own life even if he prefers death because failure to do so is tantamount to suicide.<sup><xref rid="fn210">3</xref></sup> It then follows that, since a person is obligated to preserve his own life under any and all circumstances, others are similarly required to engage in acts of rescue on his behalf regardless of his desires.</p>
<p>Moreover, as Rabbi Halperin himself concedes, the positions of <italic>Min&#x1E25;at &#x1E24;innukh</italic>, <italic>Mahari Perla</italic> and <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Shlomoh</italic> are rejected by the consensus of rabbinic authorities. The Gemara, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 73a, posits a further obligation to preserve the life of one&#x2019;s fellow based upon the verse &#x201C;Nor shall you stand idly by the blood of your fellow&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:16). That negative commandment seems to be quite independent of the obligation regarding restoration of property&#x2014;and the <italic>a fortiori</italic> obligation to rescue life&#x2014;and, accordingly, does not admit of any of the exclusions attendant upon the obligation to restore lost property.<sup><xref rid="fn211">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even if the earlier-cited authorities are correct in assuming that the prohibition &#x201C;Nor shall you stand idly by the blood of your fellow&#x201D; is limited to situations in which intervention is mandated by &#x201C;and you shall restore it to him&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 22:2) and does not establish an entirely independent obligation, the conclusion reached by those authorities is not compelled. A person&#x2019;s life, unlike his property, does not belong to himself but to the Creator.<sup><xref rid="fn212">5</xref></sup> Accordingly, argues R. Yo&#x2019;av Yehoshu&#x2019;a Weingarten of Kintzk (Konskie), in a responsum included in R. Issachar Berish Graubert&#x2019;s <italic>Teshuvot Divrei Yissakhar</italic>, no. 168, the obligation to preserve life is not a duty owed to the potential victim but to the Deity and that duty is shared equally by the rescuer and the person rescued.<sup><xref rid="fn213">6</xref></sup> In a responsum of which the earlier-cited authorities were apparently unaware, R. Meir of Rothenberg, <italic>Teshuvot Maharam ben Barukh</italic> (Prague, 5368), no. 39, rules unequivocally that an individual must be rescued from potential death even if he protests and vehemently demands that there be no intervention. A similar rebuttal is offered by R. Meir Dan Plocki, <italic>Klei &#x1E24;emdah, Parashat Ki Te&#x1E93;e</italic>, sec. 6.<sup><xref rid="fn214">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>By far the sharpest language employed in rejecting those views is that of R. Moshe Feinstein, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, II, no. 174, <italic>anaf</italic> 3:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2026; with the forgiveness of these illustrious scholars, it is clear that it is absolute error, may their Master forgive them&#x0021; Heaven forfend that the words of <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Shlomoh</italic> be uttered, for if the honor of Heaven is set aside &#x2026; for the sake of saving the life of even the most inferior person &#x2026; certainly the honor of a mortal, even of the greatest of the great, must be set aside.</p>
<p><italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> argues that although preservation of personal dignity may be a consideration sufficient to negate the obligation to restore lost property, it cannot be invoked to excuse oneself from the obligation of rescuing life: God, in permitting violation of His commandments for purposes of <italic>pikua&#x1E25; nefesh</italic> has waived His own honor; <italic>a fortiori</italic>, the dignity of a mortal cannot represent a value that might serve to abrogate the duty of rescue.</p>
<p><italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> further argues that one must conduct oneself <italic>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</italic> another person&#x2019;s lost property as one would conduct oneself <italic>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</italic> one&#x2019;s own and hence one must act the same way with regard to preservation of the life of another. <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> argues that since a person would seek to save his own life under any and all circumstances he cannot plead humiliation as an exception from the obligation to save the life of another. <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> adds that even if the individual in question</p>
<p align="blockquote">is a person to whom dignity is preferable to life, behold it is forbidden to die because of [avoidance of] demeaned dignity. Therefore, that the person would be [willing to be] wicked is meaningless in terms of exempting him from rescuing others because of his wickedness. Besides, no person has credibility to declare that his dignity is preferable to him over his life.</p>
<p>Rabbi Halperin advances another consideration relevant solely to the particular situation he addresses, <italic>viz.</italic>, potential mental incompetence. As a rationale for the principle that Sabbath restrictions are set aside for preservation of life, the Gemara, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 151b and <italic>Yoma</italic> 85b, advances the argument: &#x201C;Better that they desecrate one Sabbath on his behalf so that he may observe many Sabbaths.&#x201D; Rabbenu Nissim, <italic>Yoma</italic> 82a, offers that rationale, <italic>inter alia</italic>, in ruling that Sabbath restrictions must be set aside in order to preserve the life of a fetus even in the earliest stages of development. Rabbenu Nissim clearly maintains that this consideration is both normative and independent of other considerations in terms of setting aside halakhic restrictions.</p>
<p>Rashba, cited by <italic>Bet Yosef, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 306, apparently disagrees. Rashba addressed a question involving a person whose daughter was abducted on <italic>Shabbat</italic> and faced forced apostasy. The interlocutor sought advice with regard to the propriety of engaging in acts ordinarily forbidden on <italic>Shabbat</italic> in an attempt to rescue his daughter. Rashba replied that the matter required further study but that he was inclined to the negative. Since an apostate will surely desecrate the Sabbath, acts of rescue could readily be justified on the basis of the rationale &#x201C;Better that they desecrate one Sabbath in order to observe many Sabbaths,&#x201D; were that consideration to be considered normative. Rashba&#x2019;s failure to issue a positive ruling indicates that he did not regard that rationale to be applicable.<sup><xref rid="fn215">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, both <italic>Taz, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 306:5, and <italic>Magen Avraham, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 306:29, understood Rema, <italic>Hilkhot Shabbat</italic> 328:10, as ruling that Sabbath prohibitions may be ignored in order to save a Jew from apostasy for precisely that reason, i.e., so that he may continue &#x201C;to observe many Sabbaths.&#x201D; If so, argues Rabbi Halperin, it would follow that Sabbath restrictions may also be ignored in order to cure a person of lunacy or mental incompetence &#x201C;so that he may observe many Sabbaths.&#x201D; Actually, that point was made much earlier by R. Iser Yehudah Unterman, <italic>Shevet me-Yehudah</italic>, I (Jerusalem, 5715), 49 and 64. Rabbi Unterman, however, declares that the Gemara posits that rationale only in situations in which the undertaking is assured of success so that the observance of &#x201C;many Sabbaths&#x201D; is a certainty.</p>
<p>Moreover, the argument is inherently flawed. The notion that a single Sabbath may be set aside in order to gain the observance of many Sabbaths reflects the notion that a certain degree of risk-taking <italic>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</italic> Sabbath observance, and even compromise thereof, is warranted in order to gain maximum Sabbath observance. It does not at all follow that even <italic>&#x1E25;ayyei sha&#x2019;ah</italic>, i.e., ephemeral longevity, may be ventured solely for the sake of maximizing Sabbath observance.</p>
<p>Rabbi Halperin also notes that mental incompetence is regarded by Halakhah as itself constituting a life-threatening condition. A person afflicted in that manner poses a danger to himself as well as to others and certainly lacks the mental capacity to avoid situations of danger. In support of that contention, Rabbi Halperin cites a statement of <italic>Bet Yosef, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 228, in the name of Rashba. That responsum is published in <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyu&#x1E25;asot le-ha-Ramban</italic>, no. 281.</p>
<p>The earliest reference to mental disease sufficiently grave to imperil the life of the afflicted occurs in <italic>Issur ve-Hetter he-Arukh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn216">9</xref></sup> attributed to Rabbenu Yonah of Gerondi. <italic>Issur ve-Hetter he-Arukh</italic> cites a specific query addressed to an earlier authority, Maharam, concerning an epileptic who sought advice concerning the permissibility of partaking of a forbidden food reported to possess medicinal properties capable of curing his illness. The decision, in which Ramban acquiesces, is in the affirmative, provided that the efficacy of the remedy has been established. That decision is predicated upon a determination that epilepsy constitutes a danger to life since, at times, an epileptic may endanger himself by &#x201C;falling into fire or water.&#x201D; R. Israel Meir Mizrachi,<sup><xref rid="fn217">10</xref></sup> <italic>Teshuvot Pri ha-Are&#x1E93;</italic>, III, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> (Jerusalem, 5665), no. 21, relies upon the decision of Ramban in ruling that insanity also constitutes a danger to life and accordingly permits an abortion when it is feared that the mother may otherwise become mentally deranged. Rashba, cited by <italic>Bet Yosef, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 228, also regards mental incompetence as life-threatening in nature.<sup><xref rid="fn218">11</xref></sup> This position is also adopted by R. Mordecai Winkler, <italic>Teshuvot Levushei Mordekhai, &#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic>, no. 39, who is cited by R. Waldenberg, <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic>, IX, no. 51, <italic>sha&#x2019;ar</italic> 3, chap. 3, sec. 9. Other authorities, including <italic>Teshuvot Admat Kodesh</italic>, I, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 6; <italic>Teshuvot Pri ha-Are&#x1E93;</italic>, II, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 2; <italic>Birkei Yosef, Shiyurei Berakhah, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 155; <italic>Teshuvot Ne&#x1E93;er Mata&#x2019;ai</italic>, I, no. 8; <italic>Iggerot Mosheh, Even ha-Ezer</italic>, I, no. 67; <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic>, IV, no. 13, sec. 3; and R. Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, as cited by R. Yitzchak Zilberstein, <italic>Assia</italic>, no. 42-43 (Nissan 5746), pp. 26f., also maintain that mental incompetence constitutes a threat to life.<sup><xref rid="fn219">12</xref></sup></p>
<h1><italic>Blood-Sugar Tests</italic></h1>
<h3>1. <italic>The</italic> Shabbat <italic>Problem</italic></h3>
<p>Drawing blood on <italic>Shabbat</italic> is ordinarily forbidden. According to Rashi, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 107a, and most other early-day authorities, the prohibition is classified as a form of &#x201C;slaughter,&#x201D; one of the thirty-nine paradigmatic categories of labor prohibited on the Sabbath. Scripture declares, &#x201C;for the blood is the life (<italic>nefesh</italic>)&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 12:23), and hence removal of any quantity of blood is, halakhically speaking, tantamount to extinguishing a measure of &#x201C;life.&#x201D; According to Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Shabbat</italic> 8:7, drawing blood is categorized as a derivative form of &#x201C;threshing,&#x201D; another of the prohibited categories of labor. Threshing involves extracting a kernel from its husk. Removal of blood, according to Rambam, is similar in that it involves expressing blood from the tissues in which it is imbedded.</p>
<p>Accordingly, drawing blood on <italic>Shabbat</italic> is sanctioned only if necessary for the treatment of someone suffering, or possibly suffering, from a life-threatening illness. Untreated or insufficiently treated diabetes is certainly an illness of that nature. Crucial in the treatment of diabetics is regulation of blood sugar levels. Since a diabetic&#x2019;s body either does not produce insulin, as in Type I diabetes, or cannot process the insulin that is produced, as is the case in Type II diabetes, the diabetic&#x2019;s blood sugar levels are likely to fluctuate much more widely than those of a healthy person. Current medical practice calls for taking blood samples periodically during the course of the day, particularly before meals, in order to titrate the amount of insulin or other medication required to achieve optimum blood sugar levels. Patients are trained to draw small quantities of blood and to perform a simple blood analysis themselves.</p>
<p>Diabetics whose insulin is insufficient for their caloric intake are at risk for developing life-threatening effects of hyperglycemia, including diabetic coma. Those whose dose of insulin is too high for the quantity of calories they have consumed are in danger of potentially life-threatening hypoglycemia that can result in insulin shock. Indeed, the halakhic discussions of glucose testing on <italic>Shabbat</italic> focus upon the immediate dangers. However, from the halakhic perspective, the danger must be defined far more broadly.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that lack of precision in determining dosages, particularly over a short period of time, poses no imminent danger to the patient. Deleterious effects of minor increases of blood sugar are unlikely to become manifest until after the passage of time. However, the nature of diabetes is such that, barring a supervening illness or accident, the diabetic&#x2019;s longevity anticipation will be shortened as a result of complications of that disease. The effects of higher than normal blood sugar are cumulative. Medical science has not established a threshold of safety for fluctuation of blood sugar or a time span within which such fluctuation is innocuous.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it seems to this writer that any act designed to achieve an optimal blood sugar level for even a minimal period of time is in the category of possible <italic>pikua&#x1E25; nefesh</italic> and hence is not only permitted but is mandatory on <italic>Shabbat</italic> as well as on weekdays.</p>
<p>In practical terms, the result is that a diabetic is required to perform the necessary blood test as often as recommended by his or her physician. Of course, a rabbinic authority knowledgeable in the technical aspects of the testing procedure should be consulted for advice with regard to minimizing the nature of the Sabbath infractions involved.<sup><xref rid="fn220">13</xref></sup> The sole remaining halakhic issue is whether, in drawing blood, the patient may extract only the minimum quantity of blood necessary for analysis or whether the amount of blood removed in the performance of a single act is irrelevant. There are multiple self-use kits available for this purpose. Some draw more blood than others. Assuming, as is likely the case, that all are equally efficacious, is the patient obligated to use a device, or method, that results in removal of the least possible quantity of blood? That issue is addressed in a number of contributions to <italic>Assia</italic>, no. 73-74, Nisan 5764 (vol. 19, no. 1-2).</p>
<p>The most commonly used method of obtaining a blood sample is by means of a finger prick. The blood that is released is placed on a testing strip. The strip is then placed into a processing device that measures and announces the blood sugar level.</p>
<p>Since receiving F.D.A. approval late in the year 2000, a device has been available that accomplishes lancing, blood collection and glucose testing with a single press of a button. The device employs a vacuum mechanism that holds the skin in place while an integrated apparatus lances the skin and automatically transfers the blood to a bio-sensor strip that tests the blood and records the result. This device has the advantage of causing significantly less pain than traditional finger-stick testing and also requires only a minute quantity of blood. A survey of various self-testing devices of this material presently marketed in the United States indicates that the amount of blood drawn varies between .6 microliters and four microliters. Standard type lances are much cheaper but draw more blood than necessary.</p>
<p>In his article in <italic>Assia</italic>, Rabbi Menasheh Klein astutely draws attention to the fact that an issue exists with regard to the proper procedure to be followed on weekdays as well as on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. Drawing blood constitutes &#x201C;wounding&#x201D; and is forbidden other than for therapeutic purposes. The Gemara, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 84b, indicates that, even in a medical context, &#x201C;wounding&#x201D; beyond that which is therapeutically necessary constitutes a transgression. Accordingly, Rabbi Klein asserts that drawing more blood than is necessary for diagnostic testing is forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn221">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Meir Simchah ha-Kohen of Dvinsk, <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;, Hilkhot Shabbat</italic> 18:1, establishes a fundamental point with regard to Sabbath regulations. The general rule is that even when an otherwise forbidden act is sanctioned, e.g., for purposes of saving a life, it is forbidden to add to the quantity of a substance that is the subject of that act even if no additional physical act is required. Thus, on the Sabbath, if a limited quantity of soup is required for a patient, it is not permitted to add additional water to the pot even before the pot is placed on the stove. This is so despite the fact that only a single act of &#x201C;cooking&#x201D; is required regardless of whether the pot contains a large or small quantity of water. The concern is that, if adding food before the pot is placed on the fire is permitted, the cook may err in adding additional food in the pot after the pot has been placed on the fire. Placing a second quantity of food in a pot already on the fire constitutes an additional discrete act and, since not necessary for the purpose of preserving life, constitutes a biblical infraction. Placing more food in the pot than is required for the patient constitutes <italic>ribbuy be-shi&#x2019;urin</italic> i.e., increasing the quantity of the substance upon which the forbidden act is performed.</p>
<p>Among the various categories of &#x201C;labor&#x201D; prohibited on <italic>Shabbat</italic>, many forms of &#x201C;labor&#x201D; result in culpability at the hands of the <italic>bet din</italic> only if the prohibited act is performed upon a minimum quantity of a substance. Accordingly, although cooking even a minimum quantity of a foodstuff is proscribed, there is no culpability unless a minimum quantity equal in weight to a <italic>grogeret</italic>, or dried fig, is cooked. According to <italic>Tosafot, Mena&#x1E25;ot</italic> 64a, s.v. <italic>shetayim</italic>, and Rashba, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 15b, such acts are prohibited only by virtue of rabbinic decree. According to Rabbenu Nissim, <italic>Bei&#x1E93;ah</italic> 17a, the prohibition against <italic>ribbuy be-shi&#x2019;urin</italic> is biblical in nature.</p>
<p>With regard to some forbidden forms of activity no minimum quantity or size is prescribed. Accordingly, &#x201C;slaughter&#x201D; or killing a live creature is cause for punishment by the <italic>bet din</italic> even if the creature is a mere insect. <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic> asserts that there is no concept of <italic>ribbuy be-shi&#x2019;urin</italic>, i.e., forbidden enhancement of quantity, with regard to forbidden forms of labor that require no minimum quantity or size for culpability. Accordingly, he asserts that when an animal must be slaughtered on behalf of a patient on <italic>Shabbat</italic> and two animals are available, one large and one small, there is no reason to slaughter the smaller, leaner animal rather than the larger.</p>
<p><italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s position is in contradiction to the earlier published view of R. Joseph Babad, <italic>Min&#x1E25;at &#x1E24;innukh</italic>, no. 32, <italic>Mosekh ha-Shabbat</italic> 39:2. When two animals are available, <italic>Min&#x1E25;at &#x1E24;innukh</italic> regards the slaughter of an animal larger than necessary for the needs of the patient to be rabbinically forbidden even according to Rashba.<sup><xref rid="fn222">15</xref></sup> A similar rule exists with regard to cutting the branch of a tree bearing fruit when fruit is necessary for a patient on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. Plucking fruit, cutting a branch or otherwise severing vegetative matter from the ground to which it is attached constitutes a category of labor that is forbidden on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. In a situation in which a patient is in need of no more than two fruits and two branches are available, one bearing two fruits and the second three fruits, only the branch bearing two fruits may be severed despite the fact that the physical &#x201C;labor&#x201D; involved in severing the branch bearing a larger number of fruits is absolutely identical to the &#x201C;labor&#x201D; involved in severing the branch bearing a smaller quantity of fruit. The reason, asserts <italic>Kesef Mishneh, Hilkhot Shabbat</italic> 2:8, is that <italic>ribbuy be-shi&#x2019;iurin</italic> is forbidden. In effect, each fruit is discrete and each is the subject of the prohibition against plucking; hence more fruit than needed may not be &#x201C;plucked&#x201D; even by means of severing the branch through a single act.</p>
<p>R. Zevi Pesach Frank, <italic>Teshuvot Har &#x1E92;evi, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 177, cites R. Meir Auerbach, <italic>Imrei Binah, Dinei Shabbat</italic>, no. 17, in distinguishing between severing a branch bearing two fruits rather than a branch bearing three fruits and slaughtering a heavier rather than a lighter animal and asserts that the rule applicable to the branches does not apply to the slaughter of an animal. Since an animal is an integral whole, argues <italic>Har &#x1E92;evi</italic>, slaughter is always in the nature of a single act performed upon a single animal having the effect of extinguishing a single life regardless of the size of the animal.<sup><xref rid="fn223">16</xref></sup> Consequently, <italic>Har &#x1E92;evi</italic> permits the slaughter of the larger animal.<sup><xref rid="fn224">17</xref></sup> <italic>Har &#x1E92;evi</italic> similarly suggests that lighting a lamp containing more fuel than is necessary to satisfy the needs of the patient may also be permissible. The situation involving the lamp is more complex and involves additional considerations that are not relevant to this discussion.<sup><xref rid="fn225">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Applying that controversy to the issue of drawing a greater than necessary quantity of blood on <italic>Shabbat</italic>, Rabbi Israel Rosen, writing in the same issue of <italic>Assia</italic>, concludes that, although according to <italic>Min&#x1E25;at &#x1E24;innukh</italic> the permissibility of the procedure is questionable, nevertheless, according to <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic> and <italic>Har &#x1E92;evi</italic>, there is no reason to employ a procedure that would express a smaller quantity of blood. Rabbi Klein, however, dismisses that conclusion. Rabbi Klein understands <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s thesis as applicable only to matters such as slaughter in which there is only a single life to be taken regardless of the size of the animal. &#x201C;Wounding,&#x201D; he argues, even though it is a sub-category of &#x201C;slaughter,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn226">19</xref></sup> can be performed repeatedly upon the same animal and hence, he argues, each drop of blood expressed represents a discrete transgression.</p>
<p>Rabbi Klein&#x2019;s argument seems to be flawed in the sense that it must have been impliedly rejected by both <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic> and <italic>Har &#x1E92;evi</italic>. Every act of slaughter also involves blood-letting. The blood of a large animal is certainly more copious than that of a small animal. If so, even though each animal, large or small, has but a single life, slaughter of the larger animal should be forbidden because, <italic>ipso facto</italic>, it also involves &#x201C;wounding&#x201D; of a quantitatively greater nature, i.e., the extraction of a larger quantity of blood, each drop of which constitutes a separate infraction. In failing to reach that conclusion <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic> and <italic>Har &#x1E92;evi</italic> must have reasoned that since &#x201C;wounding&#x201D; is a sub-category of &#x201C;slaughter&#x201D; there can be no <italic>ribbuy be-shi&#x2019;urin</italic> with regard to &#x201C;wounding&#x201D; just as there is no <italic>ribbuy be-shi&#x2019;urin</italic> with regard to &#x201C;slaughter.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Putting that matter aside, <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s thesis is advanced only with regard to forms of labor that demand no minimum quantity for purposes of liability. If, as Rambam maintains, &#x201C;wounding&#x201D; is prohibited as a form of &#x201C;threshing,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn227">20</xref></sup> causing blood to flow in the course of slaughter should also be a form of &#x201C;threshing.&#x201D; Since culpability for &#x201C;threshing&#x201D; requires a minimum quantity of a <italic>grogeret</italic> it should follow that <italic>ribbuy be-shi&#x2019;urin</italic> with regard to &#x201C;threshing&#x201D; is prohibited<sup><xref rid="fn228">21</xref></sup> with the result that slaughter of a large animal on behalf of a sick person should not be warranted when slaughter of a smaller animal would suffice.<sup><xref rid="fn229">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Rosen does, however, raise an additional point that is both empirical and intriguing. The amount of blood expressed in utilization of any of the available methods is much lower than the minimum quantity of <italic>grogeret</italic>. Even assuming that an act involving a <italic>&#x1E25;a&#x1E93;i shi&#x2019;ur</italic>, i.e., a quantity insufficient to generate culpability, is biblically proscribed, the issue that seems heretofore not to have been addressed is whether there is a prohibition of <italic>ribbuy be-shi&#x2019;urin</italic> when, in aggregate, the total quantity will remain below the <italic>shi&#x2019;ur</italic>, or threshold, that gives rise to culpability.</p>
<p>The issue raised by Rabbi Rosen is germane only with regard to the Sabbath prohibition associated with drawing blood. It is not at all relevant with regard to the issue of &#x201C;wounding&#x201D; since punishment for violation of that prohibition is not contingent upon causing a fixed minimum amount of bleeding. In a brief communication, published in the same issue of <italic>Assia</italic>, R. Joshua Neuwirth, author of <italic>Shemirat Shabbat ke-Hilkhatah</italic>, dismisses the question of <italic>ribbuy be-shi&#x2019;urin</italic>. He reasons that in applying a lance, the patient is, in effect, performing an act comparable to opening a faucet. In the latter case, other than the first gush of water, the resultant flow is automatic and only an indirect result of the act of turning on the spigot. The same is the case, asserts Rabbi Neuwirth, with regard to the flow of blood following puncture of the skin: pricking the skin allows pent up blood to flow of its own accord.<sup><xref rid="fn230">23</xref></sup> Rabbi Rosen responds that, in point of fact, blood (often) does not flow of its own but requires application of pressure to express the required quantity of blood; hence, the issue of <italic>ribbuy be-shi&#x2019;urin</italic> is germane.</p>
<p>Interesting, but apparently ignored, is a point that arises from Rabbi Neuwirth&#x2019;s analogy to opening a faucet. In that case, the initial gush of water as a result of built-up pressure is deemed a human act for all purposes of Halakhah. The ongoing flow is regarded to be in the nature of <italic>gerama</italic>, i.e., an act caused only indirectly. In the absence of proximate cause, such indirect acts are generally proscribed by rabbinic decree in all situations in which a direct act is biblically forbidden. The issue not addressed is whether there is a prohibition of <italic>ribbuy be-shi&#x2019;urin</italic> with regard to acts in the nature of <italic>gerama</italic>.</p>
<h3>2. <italic>Unnecessary &#x201C;Wounding&#x201D;</italic></h3>
<p>As previously noted, Rabbi Klein is adamant in his view that drawing more blood than necessary for diagnostic purposes is forbidden and accordingly draws attention to the common medical practice of filling relatively large vials with blood despite the fact that only a fraction of the quantity drawn is actually needed for blood tests.<sup><xref rid="fn231">24</xref></sup> The practice, he emphasizes, is forbidden on weekdays as well as on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. As noted earlier, Rabbi Neuwirth clearly disagrees because, in his opinion, the additional blood flows of its own accord. Although, again as noted, that is frequently not the case with the minute quantity of capillary blood obtained by means of a needle prick or by lancing, it is certainly true with regard to venous blood drawn for more extensive diagnostic purposes. Again, as stated earlier, it seems to this writer that causing flow of blood in that manner is in the nature of <italic>gerama</italic> that is rabbinically forbidden. This writer is unaware of any source that specifically addresses the issue of whether there is a prohibition of <italic>ribbuy be-shi&#x2019;urin</italic> with regard to an act in the nature of a <italic>gerama</italic>. Even if <italic>ribbuy be-shi&#x2019;urin</italic> represented a rabbinic rather than a biblical prohibition, such an act should nevertheless be prohibited even when performed indirectly. However, it would seem to be the case that it is permissible to direct a non-Jew to perform such an act. An act that would be permissible but for the cumulative effect of three separate rabbinic prohibitions remains permissible. In this case, the act would be forbidden only because of a conjunction of three distinct rabbinic prohibitions: 1) <italic>gerama</italic> is rabbinically forbidden; 2) <italic>ribbuy beshi&#x2019;urin</italic> is rabbinically forbidden; and 3) instructing a non-Jew to perform a proscribed act is rabbinically forbidden. Hence, since rabbinic legislation does not forbid acts involving a configuration of three rabbinic decrees,<sup><xref rid="fn232">25</xref></sup> the act is not forbidden.</p>
<p>However, the prohibition against drawing excess blood on a weekday is not as clear-cut as it might seem. R. Moshe Feinstein, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh, &#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic>, I, no. 103 and <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, IV, no. 102, permits donations of blood to a blood bank on various grounds. <italic>Inter alia</italic>, he argues, the Sages regarded blood-letting not only as a therapy for various maladies but also regarded it as having prophylactic value.<sup><xref rid="fn233">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Accordingly, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> concludes that blood donations are permitted because of their medical benefit to the donor. According to <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, filling a larger than necessary vial of blood when drawing blood for diagnostic purposes should be regarded simply as a form of bloodletting permitted by the Sages because of its potential health benefit. Rabbi Klein, consistent with his view regarding drawing excess blood for diagnostic purposes, regards donation to blood banks as prohibited although, presumably, he, too, would permit such donations in a situation of a <italic>&#x1E25;oleh le-faneinu</italic>, i.e., an imminent danger as that concept is expansively defined by Halakhah.<sup><xref rid="fn234">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Permissibility of drawing more blood than necessary would thus be subject to the dispute between Rabbi Klein and <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>. Assuming that drawing more blood than is necessary constitutes illicit wounding, there is certainly cause for a Jewish physician, nurse or phlebotomist to be concerned with drawing blood in excess of the necessary quantity. However, it seems to this writer, that a Jewish patient need not protest if a non-Jewish health-care practitioner does so. The excess blood is neither drawn at the behest of the patient nor for his benefit. The benefit, if any, is convenience for the laboratory and for the person drawing the blood who wishes to avoid difficulties with his or her employer. Although the patient must cooperate and provide assistance in placement of the needle, there is no <italic>mesaye&#x2019;ah</italic> or &#x201C;assisting&#x201D; in drawing the quantity that is in excess of medical need. At that point, the patient merely holds his or her hand rigid and provides no further active assistance.</p>
<h1><italic>Use of Viagra on</italic> Shabbat</h1>
<p>The Sages prohibited many acts on <italic>Shabbat</italic> despite the fact that, in and of themselves, those acts involve no aspect of forbidden labor and are in no way inimical to the Sabbath spirit. They feared that engaging in such acts might, through excitement, confusion, overpowering desire etc., lead a person to desecrate the Sabbath, whether inadvertentently or knowingly, by performing a biblically proscribed act of labor. Thus, for example, the Sages severely limited the type and quantity of possessions that may be rescued from a burning building on <italic>Shabbat</italic> by removing them into a courtyard. Their concern was that, once rescue of property is countenanced, the prospect of loss of a significant portion of a person&#x2019;s fortune might engender emotional confusion that would prompt him to transport valuables into a public thoroughfare as well.</p>
<p>The prohibition against taking medication or engaging in therapeutic activity on <italic>Shabbat</italic> or <italic>Yom Tov</italic> is among rabbinic prohibitions of that nature. According to Rif, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 53b, and Rosh, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 5:3, the Sages feared that a person in pain or discomfort, if permitted to take medicine, might be led to pulverize the components used in compounding such medications. <italic>&#x1E24;ayyei Adam</italic> 69:1 explains that the prohibition is rooted in a concern that, if any type of medical treatment is permitted, an observer might infer that Sabbath restrictions, including the biblical prohibition involved in pulverizing medicaments, are suspended for all medical purposes even in the absence of danger to life.</p>
<p>Since even biblical restrictions are suspended in situations involving danger to life, no restriction against availing oneself of medication on <italic>Shabbat</italic> exists with regard to a patient afflicted with a potentially life-threatening illness or even of a malady that might cause permanent impairment. Nor did the Sages see fit to restrict medication or treatment of an even temporarily bedridden or incapacitated person. Essentially, the restriction is limited to individuals suffering mild discomfort or pain that is not incapacitating in nature.</p>
<p>Contemporary reality makes it difficult to appreciate the concern that prompted a rabbinic enactment limiting therapeutic measures on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. Although, on occasion, a pill may be crushed and mixed with applesauce or the like, in our day, virtually no consumer of pharmaceuticals has ever compounded a medication and consequently there is scant reason to fear that a patient may be prompted to crush medicinal ingredients. Even pharmacists are no longer apothecaries. Pharmacists dispense medications that have been produced in bulk quantities by pharmaceutical companies. As a result, neither the patient, the care-giver nor the health-care professional in personal contact with the patient has occasion inappropriately to crush or pulverize medicines on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. The concern prompting promulgation of this rabbinic decree has largely lapsed.<sup><xref rid="fn235">28</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the decree remains in force and is fully binding until rescinded by a court &#x201C;larger in number and wisdom&#x201D; than the court that enacted the decree originally.</p>
<p>Sildendfil, marketed by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals under the name Viagra, is the first Food and Drug Administration approved oral pill for treatment of impotence. Use of Viagra on <italic>Shabbat</italic> is addressed by Rabbi Joel Catane in the earlier cited issue of <italic>Assia</italic>, Nisan 5764. Rabbi Catane points to a series of considerations that serve to render use of erectile dysfunction remedies permissible on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. Those considerations merit careful examination.</p>
<p>Viagra does not cause penile erections directly. Rather, Viagra acts by enhancing the effect of nitric oxide that is normally released in response to sexual stimulation. Viagra removes impediments to the smooth muscle relaxant effects of nitric oxide which, in turn, allows increased blood flow into the areas necessary to cause and sustain an erection.<sup><xref rid="fn236">29</xref></sup> Sildenafil is also marketed under the brand name Revatio. Tadalafil, marketed as Cialis, has much the same effect and is accompanied by the same side effects. An erection is reversed when a chemical known as phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) breaks down the chemicals that caused the muscles to relax in order to accommodate an increased flow of blood. Cialis operates by flushing PDE5 and hence prevents contraction of the muscle tissue with the result that blood remains in the tissue for a longer period of time and prolongs the erection. A third FDA approved drug, Levitra, is similar to Cialis.</p>
<p>On first analysis, it might appear that erectile dysfunction remedies such as Viagra, Cialis and Levitra should not be categorized as medications within the ambit of the edict prohibiting use of medications on <italic>Shabbat</italic> by virtue of the fact that the person taking the medication suffers from no illness. The problem confronting a person seeking to avail himself of one of these pharmaceutical products is that he either cannot achieve an erection or cannot sustain an erection long enough to engage in intercourse. Yet, as codified by <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 328:120, medications are forbidden, not only when they are designed to alleviate an underlying condition, but also when they are designed <italic>le-&#x1E25;azek ha-mezeg</italic>, i.e., to &#x201C;strengthen,&#x201D; enhance or promote ongoing &#x201C;pharmacological balance&#x201D; or good health. Of course, even ordinary food is designed to achieve that goal. The rule of thumb is that whatever constitutes a <italic>ma&#x2019;akhal bari</italic>, or &#x201C;food of a healthy person,&#x201D; i.e., a substance that would be consumed by a normal person for its nutritional value in the absence of a particular health concern, is permitted whereas a substance that would not ordinarily be consumed by a healthy person is forbidden. A food that would be eaten by a healthy person may be eaten by a sickly individual even though the latter&#x2019;s purpose in consuming such food is therapeutic in nature.<sup><xref rid="fn237">30</xref></sup> Understood in this manner, use of erectile dysfunction remedies is certainly problematic: Young, virile men have no need for a pharmaceutical stimulant. The medication is designed to increase blood flow to the penis, a goal which, even if it is not to be characterized as the cure of a malady, is certainly in the nature of a measure intended <italic>le-&#x1E25;azek ha-mezeg</italic>, i.e., to restore physical prowess and performance. Thus, even if Viagra or the like is not a &#x201C;medicine,&#x201D; that serves to cure a physiological disorder, it is nevertheless not a <italic>ma&#x2019;akhal bari</italic> and hence may well be prohibited on <italic>Shabbat</italic>.</p>
<p>There may, however, be other grounds that would serve to exclude use of erectile dysfunction medications from the ambit of the prohibition against use of medicine on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. There are a host of authorities who rule that a medicine that must be taken over a period of several days may be utilized on <italic>Shabbat</italic> as well. The earliest authority to permit such medications is R. Shlomoh Kluger, <italic>Sefer ha-&#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 328:1,<sup><xref rid="fn238">31</xref></sup> who states that this is a commonly known leniency (<italic>margela be-puma de-insha</italic>). R. Joshua Neuwirth cites Rambam&#x2019;s rulings, <italic>Hilkhot Shabbat</italic> 21:22 and 22:7, to the effect that one who drinks a potion known as <italic>haltit</italic> for medicinal purposes several days before <italic>Shabbat</italic> may continue to do so on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. Indeed, as reported by R. Abraham ha-Levi Hurwitz, <italic>Or&#x1E25;ot Rabbenu ha-Kehillot Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>, I, no. 214, pp.155f., <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> goes beyond the position of other authorities in ruling that, in such circumstances, even the initial dose may be taken on <italic>Shabbat</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn239">32</xref></sup> In <italic>Hilkhot Shabbat</italic> 22:7 Rambam adds the qualifying phrase &#x201C;so that he not become ill if he interrupts drinking.&#x201D; Apparently, the reason for this exclusion from the prohibition is that the Sages sought only to forbid use of medication by a person suffering mild pain or discomfort but did not seek to include in their edict those who are ill, even if not severely so. Requirement of medication over a period of days was probably assessed as being an indication of illness rather than mere discomfort (<italic>mei&#x1E25;ush</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn240">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ingestion of erectile dysfunction medication is not necessary on a daily or periodic basis. Nevertheless, Rabbi Catane suggests that the need for such medication in conjunction with every occasion of coitus is similarly an indication of sickness rather than mere discomfort. That argument is not persuasive for two reasons: 1) Rambam&#x2019;s phraseology in <italic>Hilkhot Shabbat</italic> 22:7 seems to indicate that the crucial factor is that interruption of the medication on <italic>Shabbat</italic> would frustrate the benefit of weekday administration of the medicine by causing the earlier illness to express itself anew. That explication of this rule reflects the incident reported by the Gemara, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 140a, which serves at the basis of the ruling.<sup><xref rid="fn241">34</xref></sup> As recorded in that discussion, R. &#x1E24;iyya ben Avin was permitted to continue taking medication on <italic>Shabbat</italic> with the explanation that failure on his part to do so would make him ill. Erectile dysfunction medication does not &#x201C;cure&#x201D; an underlying malady and hence its interruption does not negate the benefit of earlier doses. 2) The leniency formulated by <italic>Sefer ha-&#x1E24;ayyim</italic> does not seem to apply to a person who suffers from (mild) headaches intermittently. Typically, such a person takes an aspirin when he experiences a headache but does not do so prophylactically or to prevent a recurrence. Such an individual would not be permitted to take aspirin on <italic>Shabbat</italic> because each headache is a new episode.<sup><xref rid="fn242">35</xref></sup> Viagra and other erectile dysfunction medications are similar in that they are used to cause or to sustain an erection whenever such physical prowess is desired. That effect is certainly in the nature of <italic>le-&#x1E25;azek ha-mezeg</italic>, i.e., achievement of more optimal physical function. A patient experiencing sexual dysfunction does not become sexually rejuvenated as a result of taking the medication over a period of time, which might render taking the medication on <italic>Shabbat</italic> permissible. Rather, the medication is used on an <italic>ad hoc</italic> basis to facilitate intercourse just as aspirin is used to alleviate an intermittent headache.</p>
<p>Rabbi Catane finds other grounds to permit Viagra and the like in the rulings of <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic>, XIV, no. 50, sec. 5, regarding tranquilizers and <italic>Teshuvot Be&#x2019;er Mosheh</italic>, I, no. 33, sec. 19, and VI, no 39, with regard to stimulants used to prevent drowsiness. In both cases there is neither an underlying physical malady nor is the drug designed to &#x201C;strengthen the constitution.&#x201D; As recorded by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 328:37, a person suffering from no illness may avail himself on <italic>Shabbat</italic> of a substance not normally consumed by a healthy person. Rabbi Catane argues that Viagra should similarly be permitted since it does not function as a cure or as a means of &#x201C;strengthening the constitution.&#x201D; However, the comparison does not seem apt since the purpose of an erectile dysfunction remedy is clearly to &#x201C;strengthen the constitution,&#x201D; i.e., to sustain penile erection in a person otherwise incapable of doing so. It is of interest to note that Rabbi Catane cites a personal communication to him from Rabbi Neuwirth in which the latter apparently takes issue with the permissive rulings of <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic> and <italic>Be&#x2019;er Mosheh</italic> regarding tranquilizers and stimulants. It should also be noted that in sec. 13 of the summary appended to <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic>, VIII, no. 15, Rabbi Waldenberg without explanation forbids use of stimulants to prevent sleep.</p>
<p>A much stronger argument cited by Rabbi Catane was earlier advanced by Dr. Abraham S. Abraham with regard to penile injections on <italic>Shabbat</italic> prior to intercourse. Although painful and cumbersome, the purpose of such injections is the same as that of Viagra, <italic>viz.</italic>, to cause the blood vessels to become engorged in order to make erection possible. Dr. Abraham&#x2019;s argument permitting penile injections is based upon another exclusion from the prohibition against medical treatment on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. Even in situations in which there is no threat to life, treatment is permissible if failure to treat will result in loss or dysfunction of an organ or limb (<italic>sakkanat ever</italic>). <italic>Ke&#x1E93;ot ha-&#x1E24;oshen, Badei ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> 138:18, and <italic>Shemirat Shabbat ke-Hilkhatah</italic> 33:1, in a gloss appended to sec. 5, rule that this exclusion applies even if foregoing treatment will result in only partial dysfunction of the organ, e.g., failure to set a fracture will not render the person lame but will result in a limp that will compromise function of the foot. Thus, Rabbi Neuwirth is cited in <italic>Nishmat Avraham</italic>, IV, introduction to <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 328, sec. 4, as permitting fertility treatments on <italic>Shabbat</italic> on the grounds that inability to conceive represents dysfunction of the reproductive organs and hence constitutes <italic>sakkanat ever</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn243">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, at least in cases in which the patient is not completely impotent, the application of this thesis to penile injections or to ingestion of Viagra and the like, is not as strong as it might appear. The terminology employed by the codifiers of this rule is &#x201C;<italic>sakkanat ever</italic>&#x201D; or danger to an organ. The concern reflected in this exclusion seems to be the threat of permanent loss or dysfunction resulting from non-treatment. Thus loss of a foot, lameness and inability to bear children each represents an irreversible loss. Reproductive organs are designed for procreation. Although fertility treatment does not restore those organs to ongoing normalcy, such treatment serves to bring the <italic>raison d&#x2019;&#x00EA;tre</italic> of those organs to actualization by making pregnancy possible.</p>
<p>However, there is no evidence indicating that transient dysfunction constitutes <italic>sakkanat ever</italic> or that enhancement of the function of a limb or organ is permitted. Thus, for example, medical treatment for a sprain that results only in temporary lameness does not seem to be encompassed within this category. Similarly, it is not at all apparent that a person rendered lame by a sprain but who, hypothetically, can walk for a brief period of time after being injected with steroids, might avail himself of such treatment on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. No &#x201C;danger&#x201D; to the limb is forestalled by such treatment. Temporary dysfunction of an organ certainly does not constitute <italic>sakkanat ever</italic>; hence, restoration of such function does not seem to constitute a remedy for <italic>sakkanat ever</italic>. A medication that would entirely reverse impotence would certainly be permissible on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. However, Viagra does not do so; it only makes sustained erection possible for a limited period of time.<sup><xref rid="fn244">37</xref></sup> Nor does failure to use Viagra for any period of time compromise its future efficacy as a treatment for impotence.</p>
<p>The strongest argument advanced by Rabbi Catane in support of the permissibility of use of Viagra and similar medications on <italic>Shabbat</italic> is based upon a responsum of R. Yitzchak Ya&#x2019;akov Weisz, <italic>Teshuvot Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>, I, no. 108. <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> permitted a husband to take medication before and after intercourse &#x201C;so that he not be harmed&#x201D; by intercourse. Presumably, in the case brought to his attention, nitroglycerin was prescribed for a patient suffering from angina in order to dilate the cardiac vessels so that they might accommodate without danger the more rapid blood flow that results from exertion during intercourse.</p>
<p><italic>Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>&#x2019;s ruling is based on the principle that a non-Jew may be instructed to perform a rabbinically forbidden act on <italic>Shabbat</italic> if such is necessary in order to fulfill a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>. As recorded in <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 140:11, intercourse is not permitted in an illuminated room. On <italic>Shabbat</italic>, when a lamp cannot be extinguished, <italic>&#x1E24;ayyei Adam, Hilkhot Shabbat</italic> 29:4, rules that it is also forbidden to interpose a &#x201C;wall&#x201D; between the lamp and the couple in order to block the light. This is forbidden even though construction of a &#x201C;temporary wall&#x201D; is only rabbinically proscribed. Nevertheless, a non-Jew may be requested to put a temporary wall in place on the basis of the principle that it is permitted to instruct a non-Jew to perform a rabbinically proscribed act in order to facilitate fulfillment of a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>, in this case, fulfillment of conjugal obligations. <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> cites <italic>Teshuvot Radvaz</italic>, III, no. 640, in demonstrating that availing oneself of medication on <italic>Shabbat</italic> is an infraction of lesser severity than commanding a non-Jew to perform a rabbinically proscribed act of labor. Hence, he argues, if ordering a non-Jew to perform such an act in order to fulfill a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> is permitted, <italic>a fortiori</italic>, taking medication must also be permissible for the purpose of fulfilling a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>. <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>&#x2019;s ruling is endorsed by <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic>, VIII, no. 15, chap. 15, sec. 14, and is cited by <italic>Nishmat Avraham</italic>, I, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 321:11, note 3. A similar ruling based on the same source was issued by <italic>Be&#x2019;er Mosheh</italic>, I, no. 33, sec. 9 and reiterated in volume VI, no. 39 of the same work.</p>
<p>However, Rabbi Neuwirth, <italic>Shemirat Shabbat ke-Hilkhatah</italic>, 2nd edition (Jerusalem, 5739), I, 33:20, note 81, apparently regards any act performed by a person himself, including taking medications on <italic>Shabbat</italic>, as a more severe infraction than the infraction involved in directing a non-Jew to perform a forbidden act.<sup><xref rid="fn245">38</xref></sup> Nevertheless, on the basis of the clear rulings of <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak, &#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic> and <italic>Be&#x2019;er Mosheh</italic>, and in light of the somewhat tentative nature of Rabbi Neuwirth&#x2019;s comment, the weight of opinion supports the conclusion that use of erectile dysfunction medications on <italic>Shabbat</italic> is permitted.</p>
<ftnote id="fn208">1. R. Meir Don Plocki, <italic>Klei &#x1E24;emdah</italic>, <italic>Parashat Ki Te&#x1E93;e</italic>, sec. 6 (1), rebuts that contention on the basis of the categorization by the Gemara, <italic>Sotah</italic> 21b, of a person who declined to rescue a drowning woman as a &#x201C;stupid pietist&#x201D; (<italic>&#x1E25;asid shoteh</italic>). <italic>Klei &#x1E24;emdah</italic>, <italic>ibid.</italic> 6(2), also notes that prevention of suicide is mandated not only by virtue of the obligation to preserve life but also by virtue of the obligation to prevent a fellow Jew from transgression. The latter obligation admits of no exception because of shame or embarrassment.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Moreover, a person is exempt from restoring lost property if rescuing such property would cause him humiliation or embarrassment only if he would be willing to suffer the loss of such property were it his own in order to spare himself similar humiliation or embarrassment. It is highly unlikely that a person would decline to rescue a close relative whose life is endangered simply because rescue would entail a measure of humiliation or embarrassment. See R. Joseph Shalom Eliashiv, <italic>Sefer ha-Zikaron le-Maran ha-Grib Zolti</italic>, ed. R. Joseph Buchsbaum (Jerusalem, 5747), p. 404.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn209">2. The application of this argument to the case under discussion is far from clear. It may well be the case that a mentally competent, fully rational individual would deem a life of mental incompetence worse than no life at all. An infant, however, never having experienced life as a person endowed with reason, has no basis for an aversion to a life bereft of reason. Moreover, lacking mental development, an infant does not have the cognitive capacity to formulate a conscious desire either to survive or not survive.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn211">4. The notion that the negative commandment is not at all contingent upon the obligation of restoring lost property is developed by Rabbi Eliashiv, <italic>Sefer ha-Zikaron</italic>, p. 404, and invoked by him in explaining why a person involved in fulfilling a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> is not thereby exempt from the obligation of rescuing a person whose life is endangered.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn213">6. Indeed, <italic>Tur Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, &#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 261, maintains that willfully abandoned property or property that a person attempts to destroy becomes <italic>res nullius</italic>. However, Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Gezelah ve-Avedah</italic> 11:11, maintains that an attempt to destroy one&#x2019;s property does not render it <italic>res nullius</italic> but that, nevertheless, there is no obligation to preserve such property. R. Yo&#x2019;av Yeshoshu&#x2019;a Weingarten&#x2019;s line of reasoning is cogent according to both positions. See Rabbi Eliashiv, <italic>Sefer ha-Zikaron</italic>, p. 404.</ftnote>

<ftnote>R.

See also <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;esed le-Avraham, Mahadura Tinyana, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 67. Since blood should be drawn with a <italic>shinuy</italic>, i.e., in an &#x201C;unusual&#x201D; manner, thereby rendering the infraction rabbinic rather than biblical, the number of times blood must be drawn need not be minimized according to this view.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn221">14. Rabbi Klein states that he had earlier expressed this view in his <italic>Mal ve-lo Para</italic> (Brooklyn, 5744). The reference is presumably to <italic>netiv</italic> 24 of that work in which Rabbi Klein demonstrates that, as is readily apparent from <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 84b, removal of more tissue than necessary, or extending an incision more than medically necessary, constitutes illicit &#x201C;wounding.&#x201D; Rabbi Klein regards drawing additional blood in the same light.</ftnote>

Applying this principle, <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic>, VIII, no. 15, sec. 6, permits a physician who must write a prescription for 10 pills, representing the dose to be administered on <italic>Shabbat</italic>, to write a prescription for 20 pills. His ruling is based upon the consideration that no additional letter or number need be written; the &#x201C;labor&#x201D; involved in writing a &#x201C;2&#x201D; is identical to that entailed in writing a &#x201C;1.&#x201D; <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic> compares that situation to the slaughter of a larger animal rather than a smaller one.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn228">21. Rashi, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 107a, cites an opinion to the effect that &#x201C;wounding&#x201D; constitutes a form of &#x201C;dyeing,&#x201D; which also requires a minimum quantity for culpability.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn229">22. Rabbi Rosen&#x2019;s comments in this regard are somewhat confusing. He seems to ignore the fact that <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s thesis is limited to forms of labor having no minimum <italic>shi&#x2019;ur</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn230">23. See, however, <italic>Magen Avraham, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 328:53, and R.

Rabbi Berkowitz, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, <italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 35, argues that, when a lance is utilized, the resultant flow of blood should be regarded in the same light as leeching. However, it may be the case that <italic>Magen Avraham</italic> maintains that it is only the blood drawn immediately by the bite of the leech that is the product of a direct act and hence only the first gush of blood following lancing would be regarded in that manner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn231">24. Dr. Jocelyn Hicks, &#x201C;Excessive Blood Drawing for Laboratory Tests,&#x201D; <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>, vol. 340, no. 21 (May 27, 1999), p. 1690, presents the results of a survey showing that community and university hospitals typically draw 2 1/2 to 7 times the amount of blood as do children&#x2019;s hospitals for identical tests. Dr. Hicks theorizes that unnecessary quantities of blood are drawn because in years gone by when the practice was developed most instruments required large quantities of serum for analysis. Earlier, J. C. Dale and S. K. Pruett, &#x201C;Phlebotomy: A Minimalist Approach,&#x201D; <italic>Mayo Clinic Proceedings</italic>, vol. 68, no. 3 (March,1993), pp. 249-255, reported that a range of 2 to 102 times and a mean of 45 times the required volume required of diagnostic tests was obtained for a sample of 113 hospital patients.</ftnote>
<ftnote>The prohibition against &#x201C;wounding&#x201D; is not necessarily predicated upon concern for the health of a particular victim or patient. However, unnecessary drawing of more than minimal quantities of blood is not without risk. Phlebotomy is highly associated with changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and can contribute to anemia. See Paaladinesh Thavendiranathan, Akshay Bagai, Albert Ebidia <italic>et al.</italic>, &#x201C;Do Blood Tests Cause Anemia in Hospitalized Patients: The Effect of Diagnostic Phlebotomy on Hemoglobin and Hematocrit Levels,&#x201D; <italic>Journal of General Internal Medicine</italic>, vol. 20, no. 6 (June, 2005), pp. 520-524. Although blood loss from laboratory testing is not likely to pose a problem for most patients, blood loss is greater in intensive care patients and after cardiovascular surgery. Other risk groups include low-birth weight newborns, patients with already existing anemia and the elderly. See Dirk Wisser, Klaus van Ackern, Ernst Knoll <italic>et al.</italic>, &#x201C;Blood Loss from Laboratory Tests,&#x201D; <italic>Clinical Chemistry</italic>, vol. 49, no. 10 (October, 2003), pp. 1651-1655. Obviously, internal bleeding and dehydration are additional risk factors. The proposed remedy is simply to use smaller tubes for drawing blood. See Jeannette O. Andrews, &#x201C;A QI (Quality Improvement) Project to Reduce Nosocomial Blood Loss,&#x201D; <italic>Dimensions of Critical Care Nursing</italic>, vol. 17, no. 2 (March-April, 1998), pp. 92-99 and Terry Rudisill, &#x201C;Smaller Tubes Reduce the Volume of Blood Drawn,&#x201D; <italic>Critical Care Nurse</italic>, vol. 22, no. 3 (June, 2002), pp. 96-95.</ftnote>

Mordecai Brisk, <italic>Teshuvot Maharam Brisk</italic>, I, no. 23. That position seems to be reflected in the comments of R. Ezekiel Landau, <italic>Dagul me-Revavah, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim, Eshel Avraham</italic> 340:5, who advances this principle only tentatively. The principle is rejected by R.

<ftnote id="fn233">26. As early as the fifteenth century B.C.E., Hippocrates asserted that bloodletting restored the harmony of the body&#x2019;s humors. There are reports of bloodletting by English monks in 674 C.E. Bloodletting reached the height of its popularity in Europe between 1825 and 1835. Venesection, or bloodletting, does serve to reduce hypertension but any benefit is transient. Modern medicine has come to recognize the value of &#x201C;therapeutic phlebotomy&#x201D; in the treatment of a few relatively rare diseases. Among those are: polycythemia, a hematologic disorder characterized by an increased concentration of red blood cells; hemochromatosis, a hereditary disorder that causes the small intestines to absorb excessive amounts of iron; and porphyia cartenea tarfa (PCT), one of several conditions caused by an enzyme deficiency that are collectively known as porphyrias. PCT is caused by deficiency of an enzyme called uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase and exacerbated by exposure to toxic chemicals including Agent Orange and certain herbicides, alcohol and drugs such as estrogen and iron supplements. See Salena M. Wright and Jean Finical, &#x201C;Beyond Leeches: Therapeutic Phlebotomy Today,&#x201D; <italic>American Journal of Nursing</italic>, vol. 100, no. 7 (July, 2000) pp. 55-56, 58-59 and 61-63.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Use of leeches has also had a limited comeback in modern medicine. In the early years of the 20th century it was discovered that the mouth and throat of the leech contain a substance that prevents blood from coagulating. See R. T. Sawyer, &#x201C;Leeches&#x2014;New Role for an Old Medicine,&#x201D; <italic>Ward&#x2019;s Bulletin</italic>, Spring, 1986, pp. 1-4. The compound was isolated and named hirudin. However, with the advent of heparin, there is no longer significant reason to use leeches for that purpose. Beginning in the 1970&#x2019;s medicinal leech therapy was introduced primarily for use in plastic and reconstructive surgery, postoperative venous congestion and graft rejection. Leech application often has a positive effect in treatment of superficial phlebitis and may improve the cosmetic appearance of spider-burst veins. The anti-inflammatory and circulation-enhancing effects of chemicals in leech saliva combined with blood and lymph drainage are of benefit in arthrosis pain management. The most valuable use of leech therapy is in preventing thrombosis or insufficiency of anastomosed arteries that may occur in corrective microsurgery. In such procedures, leeches serve to drain replanted or transplanted tissue. The most comprehensive study of leech therapy is Andreas Michalsen, Manfred Roth and Gustav Dobos, <italic>Medicinal Leech Therapy</italic> (New York, 2007). See also Michelle M. O&#x2019;Hara, &#x201C;Leeching: A Modern Use for an Ancient Remedy,&#x201D; <italic>American Journal of Nursing</italic>, December, 1988, pp. 1656-1658.</ftnote>

Side effects may include headache, flushing, indigestion and changes in vision, principally altered vision perception and blurred vision caused by a decrease in blood flow to the optic nerve and possibly also a sudden decrease or loss of hearing.

See also <italic>idem, Hagahot Maharsham, Or&#x1E25;ot &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 328:27. R. Moshe Stern, <italic>Teshuvot Be&#x2019;er Mosheh</italic>, I, no. 33, sec. 7, follows the position of <italic>Da&#x2019;at Torah</italic>. See also <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic>, VIII, no. 15, chap. 15, sec. 15. In light of Rambam&#x2019;s ruling cited herein, it would appear that the controversy between <italic>Sefer ha-&#x1E24;ayyim</italic> and <italic>Da&#x2019;at Torah</italic> is limited to situations in which the earlier illness will not again became manifest if the medication is interrupted on <italic>Shabbat</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote>It should be noted that in a later work, <italic>Shenot &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, I, no. 152, sec. 5, R. Shlomoh Kluger reiterates his earlier recorded &#x201C;commonly known leniency&#x201D; but declares that it applies only if the illness has not dissipated (<italic>lo pasak</italic>) before <italic>Shabbat</italic>; apparently, then, if symptoms of the illness are no longer present, the medication may not be continued on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. However, as evident from Rambam&#x2019;s rulings, if discontinuation of the medication will cause a new outbreak of the illness, the medication may be continued. If so, there may be no controversy between <italic>Da&#x2019;at Torah</italic> and <italic>Sefer ha-&#x1E24;ayyim</italic>. Cf., however, <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic>, VIII, no. 15, chap. 15, sec. 16, who apparently assumes that <italic>Da&#x2019;at Torah</italic> forbids continuation of medication on <italic>Shabbat</italic> even in such circumstances.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Moreover, in <italic>Kinat Soferim</italic>, II, <italic>Hashmatot le-Shnot &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 125, R. Shlomoh Kluger clarifies his position in stating that he had permitted only medicinal potions that can be eaten or imbibed but would not ordinarily be consumed by healthy persons. A person already availing himself of such a therapy, since he is aware of his need before <italic>Shabbat</italic>, will prepare his medications in advance; thus there is no fear that he will pulverize the medicaments on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. Other forms of therapy, he rules, are forbidden on the Sabbath under all circumstances because of a separate consideration, <italic>viz.</italic>, &#x201C;<italic>shema yimra&#x1E25;</italic>,&#x201D; lest he reduce a medicinal substance by smearing. When such a consideration pertains, it cannot be obviated by advance preparation. That comment is also included in Rabbi Kluger&#x2019;s <italic>Shnot &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 152, addendum to sec. 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn239">32. The source of this ruling, the Gemara, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 140a, permits use of medication on <italic>Shabbat</italic>, at least under some circumstances, when the medication had previously been used on Thursday and Friday. Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Shabbat</italic> 22:7, codifies the rule in that manner. However, in <italic>Hilkhot Shabbat</italic> 21:22, Rambam states only that &#x201C;If he drank <italic>haltit</italic> before <italic>Shabbat</italic> he may continue drinking it on <italic>Shabbat</italic>.&#x201D; Cf., <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic>, ibid., sec. 16.

<title><italic>Chapter 7</italic> New York City Water</title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall not make yourselves detestable with any swarming thing that swarms and you shall not defile yourselves with them&#x2026;&#x201D; (Leviticus 11:43). [The Torah] included in this negative commandment things that swarm on the ground, winged swarming things and things that swarm in the water. What are things that swarm in the water? Those small creatures such as worms and leeches that are in the water and exceedingly large creatures that are animals of the sea.</italic></p>
<p align="blockquote">RAMBAM, HILKHOT MA&#x2019;AKHALOT ASSUROT 2:12</p>
<h1>I. <italic>The Problem</italic></h1>
<p>The saga of what one magazine has termed the &#x201C;Jewish Watergate&#x201D; began in July, 2003. For a number of years an Israeli firm had been marketing Romaine lettuce and other produce certified as free of insect infestation. In the course of demonstrating proper methods of vegetable inspection an instructor at the Mashgiach Training Institute of Yeshiva Birkas Reuven discovered insects in the water used for washing lettuce.<sup><xref rid="fn246">1</xref></sup> Samples were subsequently sent to the firm marketing the produce. In due course a response was received indicating that the insect that had been identified was known to spawn in water rather than in vegetables. Hence, the problem was in the water used for cleansing the produce rather than in the vegetables themselves&#x0021; That finding was rapidly confirmed by examining tap water in the locale in which the lettuce had been rinsed.<sup><xref rid="fn247">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The insects that were detected are tiny aquatic creatures, crustaceans called copepods which are millimeter-long zooplankton common both in the ocean and in ground water. These creatures have a thick body, long antennae and numerous legs.<sup><xref rid="fn248">3</xref></sup> Since the water supply is treated with chlorine very few, if any, of the insects found in the water have been found to be alive. The color of these insects is whitish grey which renders them translucent and accounts for why they are not easily spotted. They are, however, visible to the naked eye without magnification.</p>
<p>New York City&#x2019;s Department of Environmental Protection has long been aware of the existence of these copepods. A manual published by that agency specifically states that &#x201C;several aquatic species have been recognized as nuisance organisms in potable water supplies. Although these organisms are not considered public health risks, they are often the source of consumer complaints.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn249">4</xref></sup> The gauge of most filters routinely affixed to kitchen faucets is probably too large to prevent the escape of such tiny organisms. However, filters with impressively low gauges, some as low as .05 microns, are readily available. Such low-gauge filters effectively eliminate the targeted organisms.</p>
<p>A number of prominent halakhic authorities have affixed their signatures to statements varying in terms of stridency but unequivocal in admonishing the public to filter water prior to use. The most significant of those is a ruling authored by R. David Feinstein bearing the endorsements of R. Joseph Shalom Eliashiv and R. Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg.<sup><xref rid="fn250">5</xref></sup> That statement containing a succinct explanation of the grounds for the prohibition was reproduced and widely disseminated. Prominent among the signators of other statements are R. Feivel Cohen, author of <italic>Badei ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, and R. Yechezkel Roth, formerly the <italic>dayyan</italic> of the Satmar community in Borough Park.<sup><xref rid="fn251">6</xref></sup> A comprehensive article authored by R. Chaim Oberlander discussing all factors involved in resolution of this issue, including a number of possible leniencies, is featured in vol. IX, no. 4 (Tammuz 5764) of <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, published in Monsey, N.Y. Additional articles by R. Shlomoh Gross, <italic>dayyan</italic> of the Belz community in Borough Park, and R. Yitzchak Bistritsky, a <italic>dayyan</italic> of the Satmar community in Borough Park, containing valuable information also appear in the same issue of <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn252">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The general rule with regard to examination for the presence of insects is that examination is required in all instances in which infestation is common but that examination is not required in situations in which there are no grounds to suspect that infestation has occurred. Thus, for example, <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Adam</italic> 38:13, rules that, in Germany and France, all cherries, save for one species known as &#x201C;sour cherries,&#x201D; require examination but reports that in Danzig insect infestation of cherries is not common and hence examination is not required unless the presence of worms is indicated by pock marks on the skin. Plums, he reports, must be presumed to be infested in all countries with the exception of Lithuania where the plums are puny and insect-free. Certainly, the situation has changed significantly since the time of <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Adam</italic>, undoubtedly as a result of widespread spraying. Whether or not particular species of fruits and vegetables require examination depends upon the species and the locale.</p>
<p>In some areas of Brooklyn, particularly in Borough Park and Flatbush, as well as in Washington Heights, copepods have been found in the drinking water. Where infestation has been demonstrated, filtration of the water is required. Where filtration is required, it is necessary not only for drinking-water but also water used in cooking, rinsing food, gargling and brushing teeth.<sup><xref rid="fn253">8</xref></sup> However, even within those neighborhoods, in many locations no insects have been detected despite repeated examination.<sup><xref rid="fn254">9</xref></sup> The Environmental Protection Agency is reported to have determined that infestation does not occur in the reservoir but at some point close to the point of discovery.<sup><xref rid="fn255">10</xref></sup> There is, however, strong scientific evidence suggesting that the species of copepods found in New York water originate in the reservoirs rather than in localized water mains.<sup><xref rid="fn256">11</xref></sup> Nevertheless, in some buildings, copepods may fall to the bottom of the water tower or, for some unexplained reason, their movement may be impeded in some manner by the plumbing system. If so, it seems to this writer that, if upon multiple examinations it is evident that the water in any particular building is insect-free, further examination is unnecessary. Examination is best carried out against a black background or, less optimally, by placing a cloth at the tap in order to catch the copepods as they emerge. Care should be taken that the tap be only partially opened in order to prevent dismemberment of the insects by the pressure of the water running through the cloth.</p>
<h1>II. <italic>Minuscule Insects</italic></h1>
<p>The almost reflexive reaction of many people to reports of infestation of New York water by copepods was that the issue is hardly novel. Probably every person who has had the benefit of a freshman biology course has had the experience of placing a droplet of water on a slide and examining it under a microscope. The experience of viewing countless numbers of microorganisms is both thrilling and disconcerting: Thrilling because the microscope becomes a window opening upon the hidden mysteries of divine creation through which a tiny cross-section of the myriad complexities of the natural order is revealed; disconcerting, at least to a Jew, because, mindful as he is of the biblical admonition &#x201C;of all that creeps in the water and of all the living creatures that creep in the waters &#x2026; you shall not eat of their flesh&#x201D; (Leviticus 11:10-11), he becomes jarringly aware that with every sip of water he imbibes copious quantities of such creeping things.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the problem and its resolution requires a determination of whether, in seeking to abide by the commandments of the Torah, a Jew must be concerned with subvisual phenomena or only with that which is detectable upon gross observation. The question is by no means limited to establishment of the parameters of the dietary code. A quite similar issue arises, <italic>inter alia</italic>, with regard to the validity of a Torah scroll. A severed or disconnected letter disqualifies the entire scroll. But even with, relatively speaking, moderate magnification, what appear to be vast chasms of open space can be seen in the structure of the letters of every Torah scroll. The discharge of even a minute quantity of menstrual blood renders a woman a <italic>niddah</italic>. What is the status of a woman if the discharge is too slight to be seen by the naked eye but can be readily perceived upon magnification? More recently, the selfsame issue has arisen with regard to the status of a fertilized ovum that is as yet invisible to the naked eye.<sup><xref rid="fn257">12</xref></sup> The resolution of that question may impact upon the propriety of utilizing the &#x201C;morning-after pill&#x201D; for termination of pregnancy and upon the permissibility of destroying a fertilized ovum at the very earliest stages of cell division.<sup><xref rid="fn258">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The earliest discussion of halakhic implications of subvisual phenomena is that of R. Israel Lipschutz in his commentary on the Mishnah, <italic>Tiferet Yisra&#x2019;el, Avodah Zarah, Bo&#x2019;az</italic> 2:3. <italic>Tiferet Yisra&#x2019;el</italic> reports that some fifty or sixty years earlier a prominent rabbinic authority ruled that a fish, theretofore presumed to be non-kosher because it lacked scales, was indeed kosher. That authority issued his ruling subsequent to examining the skin of the fish with a &#x201C;microscope&#x201D; (<italic>sic</italic>: probably a magnifying glass) and discovering scales. In that instance, magnification was utilized to permit that which otherwise would be regarded as forbidden rather than to forbid the otherwise permissible. <italic>Tiferet Yisra&#x2019;el</italic> peremptorily dismisses that view on the grounds that the Gemara, <italic>Niddah</italic> 51b, categorizes the scales that are the hallmark of kosher species as being in the nature of a &#x201C;garment&#x201D; (<italic>levush</italic>). <italic>Tiferet Yisra&#x2019;el</italic> asserts that each of the minuscule scales of the species in question is &#x201C;no more than a tiny dot which the eye cannot perceive.&#x201D; Accordingly, he concludes that such scales &#x201C;certainly cannot be categorized as a garment&#x201D; and hence the species must be regarded as non-kosher. <italic>Tiferet Yisra&#x2019;el</italic> bases his position entirely upon the idiosyncratic halakhic definition of a &#x201C;scale&#x201D; rather than upon a global assertion that Halakhah takes no cognizance of subclinical phenomena. <sup><xref rid="fn259">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Later, in discussing a somewhat different matter, R. Shlomoh Kluger, <italic>Teshuvot Tuv Ta&#x2019;am va-Da&#x2019;at, Mahadura Tinyana, kuntres a&#x1E25;aron</italic>, no. 53, comments upon the method commonly employed in examining the lungs of an animal subsequent to slaughter. Whenever an adhesion is found, a possibility exists that it occurred because of a perforation in the underlying pulmonary tissue. Therefore, the adhesion is peeled away and the lung is blown up in order to examine for the presence of a lesion. The practice, as described by R. Shlomoh Kluger, involves placing water or saliva upon the exposed site of the adhesion and then looking for bubbling caused by escaping air which, in turn, is evidence of the presence of a minuscule hole. That examination is not unlike the procedure commonly employed by an automobile repairman seeking to locate the site of a puncture that has caused a flat tire. <italic>Tuv Ta&#x2019;am va-Da&#x2019;at</italic> dismisses as absurd his own suggestion that a magnifying glass might be used to search for a perforation visually and to substitute that procedure for the usual mode of examination. In context, <italic>Tuv Ta&#x2019;am va-Da&#x2019;at</italic> dismisses magnification as an unacceptable means of examination. More to the point is the fact that magnification of a sufficiently high power will always disclose the presence of holes with the result that, if cognizance must be taken of that phenomenon, no animal is kosher&#x0021;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in his <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Shlomoh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:1, R. Shlomoh Kluger remarks that with proper magnification minuscule creatures can always be found in water, but &#x201C;the Torah was not given to ministering angels&#x201D; with the result that creatures that cannot be perceived visually are not prohibited.<sup><xref rid="fn260">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The classic and most frequently quoted source with regard to the issue of microscopic organisms is the comment of R. Yechiel Michel Epstein, <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:36. <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> writes:</p>
<p align="blockquote">I have heard that every drop of water, and particularly of rainwater, is full of minuscule creatures that the eye cannot see. In my youth, I heard from a person who had been in distant places and saw in water, by means of a lens of exceedingly great magnification, [i.e., that magnifies] tens of thousands of times, many species of creatures.</p>
<p align="blockquote">In light of this, how may we drink water &#x2026; ? Indeed, the truth is that the Torah did not forbid that which the eye cannot perceive, for the Torah was not given to angels. For, if not so, many scientists have written that the entire atmosphere is also full of extremely minuscule creatures and that when a person opens his mouth he swallows a number of them &#x2026; . Even if this is so, since the eye cannot perceive them, it is of no significance. However, that which the eye can see, even [if only] against the sun and even if it is the tiniest of the tiny, is a veritable insect.<sup><xref rid="fn261">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Without explicitly citing the earlier comments of <italic>Tiferet Yisra&#x2019;el, Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> declares the converse to be true as well, i.e., when visual perception is required to satisfy any halakhic requirement, artificial magnification is of no avail. Thus, <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 83:15, writes:</p>
<p align="blockquote">And know that it is clear that, with regard to a matter that requires visual perception, it is of no avail if one sees by means of a lens that magnifies visual perception; rather, one must see by means of the eye itself. Such is the case with regard to matters in the whole Torah in its entirety with regard to that which requires visual perception.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, the requirement that scales must be visually perceivable for an aquatic species to be regarded as kosher is, according to <italic>Tiferet Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, quite independent of the general question of the status of subvisual phenomena. However, the general rule formulated by <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> seems to be a matter of dispute. The rule with regard to Torah scrolls, <italic>tefillin</italic> and <italic>mezuzot</italic> is that no letter may extend to the edge of the parchment; some blank space must remain as a margin on each side of the letter. Is the letter validly written if examination with a magnifying glass reveals that there is indeed empty space in the margin even though the blank space is not manifestly evident to the naked eye? R. Moshe Sternbuch, <italic>Mo&#x2019;adim u-Zemanim</italic>, II, no. 124, cites the late <italic>Tchebiner Rav</italic>, R. Dov Berish Weidenfeld, as ruling that a scroll written in such a manner is invalid.<sup><xref rid="fn262">17</xref></sup> That ruling is entirely consistent with the position of <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>. However, <italic>Mo&#x2019;adim u-Zemanim</italic> also cites R. Ze&#x2019;ev Mintzberg as disputing that view in ruling that it is sufficient that a blank margin be discernible upon magnification. Rabbi Mintzberg&#x2019;s view is recorded in his responsa collection, <italic>She&#x2019;erit Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, nos. 11 and 12.<sup><xref rid="fn263">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, <italic>Mo&#x2019;adim u-Zemanim</italic> proceeds to discuss the status of an <italic>etrog</italic> in which a very small piece of the flesh is missing and to relate that issue to this dispute. As recorded in <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 648:2, at least optimally, the <italic>etrog</italic> should be whole. What is the status of an <italic>etrog</italic> in which the hole can be seen only with a magnifying glass? <italic>Mo&#x2019;adim u-Zemanim</italic> asserts that the status of such an <italic>etrog</italic> is contingent upon resolution of the controversy between the <italic>Tchebiner Rav</italic> and Rabbi Mintzberg.</p>
<p>To the mind of this writer, that conclusion is unwarranted. The position of <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> and the <italic>Tchebiner Rav</italic> is readily grasped: The requirements of the Torah are to be understood as determinable under ordinary circumstances. The &#x201C;creeping&#x201D; organisms interdicted by Scripture are defined as creatures that would have been perceived as &#x201C;creeping&#x201D; at the time of revelation at Mount Sinai. &#x201C;<italic>Ein ha-Kadosh barukh Hu ba be-teruniyah im beriyotav</italic>&#x2014;The Holy One, blessed be He, does not act despotically with His creatures.&#x201D; (<italic>Avodah Zarah</italic> 3a), i.e., at Sinai, the Deity did not establish requirements that they could not possibly meet. The Torah was given to humans, not to angels (<italic>Berakhot</italic> 25b; <italic>Yoma</italic> 30a; <italic>Kiddushin</italic> 54a; and <italic>Me&#x2019;ilah</italic> 14b). Hence, perforce, the connotation of a &#x201C;creeping&#x201D; organism, for example, must be limited to creatures that could have been identified at that time by use of conventional modes of observation. Conversely, according to <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, if God stipulated blank margins for Torah scrolls, <italic>tefillin</italic> and <italic>mezuzot</italic>, the term &#x201C;<italic>mukaf gevil</italic>&#x201D; (surrounded by a margin) must have been understood as a visually perceivable margin and hence that must have been&#x2014;and must remain&#x2014;the meaning of the term.</p>
<p>Rabbi Mintzberg&#x2019;s position is equally comprehensible. As has been noted earlier, the Gemara declares that &#x201C;the Torah was not given to ministering angels.&#x201D; Hence microscopic organisms could not have been banned at Mount Sinai. The Torah also requires that scrolls have margins. Of course, at Sinai, a scribe upon completing the writing of such a scroll could not have been certain that a margin existed unless he could have seen the empty space with his naked eye. For much the same reason, a person intent upon fulfilling the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> of eating <italic>ma&#x1E93;ah</italic>, which requires him to eat a quantity of <italic>ma&#x1E93;ah</italic> equal to a <italic>ke-zayit</italic> (an olive) would perforce have to eat a bit more than a <italic>ke-zayit</italic> since absolutely precise measurements are beyond human capacity. That, however, does not imply that the Torah insists that sufficient space be left so that it may be perceived by the naked eye any more so than that the Torah insists that a person eat a bit more than a <italic>ke-zayit</italic> of <italic>ma&#x1E93;ah</italic>. That which is added for reasons of doubt is not intrinsic to the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> itself. A person informed by the Holy Spirit that he has consumed a <italic>ke-zayit</italic> of <italic>ma&#x1E93;ah</italic> need eat no more. Similarly, according to Rabbi Mintzberg, a scribe informed by the Holy Spirit&#x2014;or by a magnifying glass&#x2014;that a margin does exist may declare the scroll to be valid.</p>
<p>The question of the suitability of an <italic>etrog</italic> in which a tiny portion has been eroded involves an entirely different issue. Resolution of that question depends upon the definition of the term &#x201C;missing&#x201D; (<italic>&#x1E25;aser</italic>). Presumably, all would agree that, if it is only angels who realize that a tiny fragment is missing, the <italic>etrog</italic> may be used without hesitation for purposes of fulfilling the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>. Hence all would agree that &#x201C;<italic>&#x1E25;aser</italic>&#x201D; must be defined as that which normal human beings, using methods of examination naturally available to them, would perceive as being <italic>&#x1E25;aser</italic>. If so, a microscopic erosion, by virtue of halakhic definition, does not render the <italic>etrog</italic> a <italic>&#x1E25;aser</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn264">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The principle enunciated by <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> is readily traceable to the Mishnah, <italic>Nega&#x2019;im</italic> 4:4. The various forms of <italic>&#x1E93;ara&#x2019;at</italic> described in Leviticus 13 cause defilement only if the manifestation covers the area of a <italic>gris</italic>, usually assumed to be approximately the size of a dime. The Mishnah, <italic>Nega&#x2019;im</italic> 4:4, states that an afflicted area the size of a <italic>gris</italic> causes defilement even if a hair is encompassed in that area. The hair certainly occupies space and hence the tiny opening through which the hair invades the <italic>&#x1E93;ara&#x2019;at</italic> and displaces the skin cannot itself constitute a site manifesting a symptom of <italic>&#x1E93;ara&#x2019;at</italic>. Nevertheless, the Mishnah declares, &#x201C;We are not concerned that the space of the black hair may have diminished the <italic>baheret</italic> (one of the forms of <italic>&#x1E93;ara&#x2019;at</italic>) for [the hair] is devoid of substance.&#x201D; Rambam, in his <italic>Commentary on the Mishnah, ad locum</italic>, interprets that comment as meaning that &#x201C;the size of the hole from which the hair emerges is extremely minuscule and lacks <italic>perceivable</italic> [emphasis added] size that would diminish the size [of the <italic>baheret</italic>].&#x201D;</p>
<p>However, the ruling of the Mishnah with regard to <italic>&#x1E93;ara&#x2019;at</italic> does not really serve to establish a precedent for <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>&#x2019;s thesis. Determining the criteria of what constitutes <italic>&#x1E93;ara&#x2019;at</italic> is distinguishable from other aspects of Jewish law in that Scripture explicitly provides that the determination is to be made &#x201C;entirely in accordance with the sight of the eyes of the priest&#x201D; (Leviticus13:12). The determination of impurity by reason of <italic>&#x1E93;ara&#x2019;at</italic> is thus made expressly contingent upon subjective appearance &#x201C;in the eyes of the priest&#x201D; rather than upon objective reality.</p>
<p>The basic principle of Jewish law formulated by <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> has a parallel in the Roman law maxim &#x201C;<italic>De minimis non curat lex</italic>&#x2014;The law takes no cognizance of a trifle.&#x201D; However, the trifle that Jewish law declines to recognize is considerably more trivial than that to which Roman law refers. In fact, it is so trivial as to be, literally, non-perceivable.</p>
<p>One caveat must be added. Assuming that terms employed by Scripture in describing physical entities must be understood as entities perceivable at the time of Revelation, it does not follow that any particular present-day subclinical phenomenon was also subclinical at the time of the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. In a note published in R. Yechiel Michel Tucatzinsky&#x2019;s <italic>Bein ha-Shemashot</italic> (Jerusalem, 5689), p. 153, and frequently cited in rabbinic discussions of this topic, R. Iser Zalman Meltzer suggests that human eyesight was far more keen in ancient times than at present. The Mishnah, <italic>Bekhorot</italic> 54b, states that even in open places animals may be regarded as members of a single group for purposes of tithing so long as the animals are all present within a limited, specified area. As Rashi explains the Mishnah, that area is defined as the area in which the animals can pasture under the supervision of a single shepherd. That, in turn, is defined by the Mishnah as an area having a radius of sixteen <italic>mil</italic>. The Gemara explains that the key to establishing the determination of that radius is the ability of a single shepherd to see, and hence to safeguard, the entire group of animals. As expressed by the Gemara, <italic>ad locum</italic>: &#x201C;The Sages determined that the eye of a shepherd can master sixteen <italic>mil</italic>.&#x201D; There are various conflicting opinions among rabbinic decisors with regard to the definition of a <italic>mil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn265">20</xref></sup> According to the most widely accepted views, calculations of the distance of a <italic>mil</italic> vary from between 960 meters (3,149.60 feet)<sup><xref rid="fn266">21</xref></sup> to approximately 1,160 meters (3,805.77 feet).<sup><xref rid="fn267">22</xref></sup> Rabbi Meltzer observes that it is quite impossible for a person to see objects at such a great distance.<sup><xref rid="fn268">23</xref></sup> Accordingly, he concludes that, over the ages, our sense of sight has become dulled.<sup><xref rid="fn269">24</xref></sup> Rabbi Meltzer attributes that phenomenon to widespread reliance upon artificial illumination which, he opines, has caused natural eyesight partially to atrophy. In support of that opinion he comments, &#x201C;We know that, even today, the Bedouin who do not use our lamps can see very far.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thus it is certainly arguable that the organisms denoted by Leviticus 11:10-11 are those that were perceivable at the time the commandment was announced and that those organisms remain forbidden even if, in our age, they are no longer visible to the naked eye. However, this is not to say that microscopic organisms are forbidden. Even the shepherd of antiquity did not enjoy omnivision; after all, he could see only a distance of sixteen <italic>mil</italic>. Since that time there has been, at worst, only limited optical degeneration. Perhaps in antiquity the average man possessing eyesight of the quality common among his peers could see with his naked eye even that which is visible to us only upon two-three- or even ten-power magnification. Consequently, organisms that are but marginally subvisual may well be forbidden but those that can be seen only with a microscope rather than with a magnifying glass could not conceivably be within the ambit of the prohibition.</p>
<p><italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>&#x2019;s position with regard to minute organisms is amplified by R. Samuel ha-Levi Woszner, <italic>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, VII, no. 122. <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> addresses the problem of insects that are visible to the naked eye but which, upon gross examination, can be seen only as specks or black dots and hence are not recognizable as insects. Since they cannot be recognized as insects by the naked eye due to lack of perceivable limbs, antennae or other discernible body parts, <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> regards them as permissible.<sup><xref rid="fn270">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>An obvious objection to that view is the ruling of Rema, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:6, with regard to fruit in which a &#x201C;black dot&#x201D; is evident. Rema rules that it is forbidden to eat such fruit without first removing the infested portion because the black dot &#x201C;is the place from which the worm begins to develop &#x2026; and is forbidden just as the worm itself [is forbidden]. The &#x201C;black dot&#x201D; is certainly not perceivable as an organism but it is nevertheless prohibited by Rema. <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> counters that objection by asserting that the organisms or larvae described by Rema will eventually develop into macroorganisms and for that reason they are forbidden even in earlier stages of development. Thus the &#x201C;black dots&#x201D; described by Rema are distinguishable from microorganisms that will never become visibly discernible.<sup><xref rid="fn271">26</xref></sup> Basing himself upon <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</italic>, no. 275, <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> also acknowledges that, if the organism can be perceived, or will at any time be perceived, as propelling itself, such locomotion, in and of itself, serves to establish its identity as a forbidden creature.</p>
<p>However, R. Moshe Viya, <italic>Bedikat ha-Mazon ke-Halakhah</italic>, I (Jerusalem, 5758) 2:4, reports that the late R. Shlomoh Zalman Auerbach ruled that organisms that are visible but which are not perceivable as &#x201C;creeping things&#x201D; are forbidden. A somewhat different version of Rabbi Auerbach&#x2019;s position is reported by R. Joshua Neuwirth, <italic>Shemirat Shabbat ke-Hilkhatah</italic>, I, 2nd edition (Jerusalem, 5739) 3:37, note 105. Rabbi Neuwirth relates that Rabbi Auerbach originally opined that an organism that can never be perceived as living or mobile cannot be regarded as a &#x201C;creeping thing that creeps upon the earth&#x201D; (Leviticus 11:41). However, Rabbi Auerbach later recounted that he heard from persons close to <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> that the latter considered such organisms to be forbidden. In point of fact, <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 14:6, s.v. <italic>ve-shi&#x2019;ur</italic>, writes explicitly: &#x201C;[Even] if the eye does not recognize it because of its small size, if it is yet whole it does not become nullified by virtue of rabbinic decree because of the law of <italic>biryah</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn272">27</xref></sup> <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> clearly maintains that even organisms that cannot be identified as insects are forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn273">28</xref></sup> R. Joseph Shalom Eliashiv is also quoted in <italic>Bedikat ha-Mazon ke-Halakhah</italic>, I, 2:4, note 4, as ruling that all such creatures are forbidden even if they cannot immediately be identified as insects.<sup><xref rid="fn274">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>In point of fact this issue has no bearing upon the problem of New York City water for the simple reason that many of the copepods in question are clearly recognizable as insects.<sup><xref rid="fn275">30</xref></sup></p>
<h1>III. <italic>Permitted Insects</italic></h1>
<h2>A. <italic>Insects Spawned in Stagnant Water</italic></h2>
<p>As formulated in Leviticus 11:10, the prohibition against forbidden aquatic creatures reads: &#x201C;And all that do not have fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers, of all that creep in the waters and of all living creatures that are in the water, they are detestable unto you.&#x201D; The Gemara, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 66b, declares that the requirement that aquatic creatures have fins and scales as a condition of dietary acceptability is limited to those that spawn in &#x201C;the seas and in the rivers&#x201D; and hence creatures that spawn in stagnant pits or utensils are permissible. The Gemara, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 67a, qualifies that exclusion in indicating that creatures that spawn in utensils are permissible only so long as they remain in their aquatic element. Upon emerging, or upon being removed, from water they acquire the forbidden status of &#x201C;creeping things that creep upon the earth&#x201D; (Leviticus 11:29) and remain prohibited even if they return to the water from which they emerged. Thus, insects that spawn in stagnant water collected in stationary cisterns or the like are not forbidden unless they become separated from the water that is their natural habitat.</p>
<p>Although the status of reservoirs themselves in this regard is a matter of some controversy,<sup><xref rid="fn276">31</xref></sup> bugs found in water that is collected in a pit or the like, but in situations in which the water originates in a river or stream, cannot <italic>ipso facto</italic> be presumed to be permissible. The status of such organisms is perforce the subject of doubt: Did the insects originate in the free-flowing source and hence they are forbidden or did they spawn in stagnant water subsequent to entering the reservoir? <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> 84:5 rules that such insects are forbidden because of their doubtful status.<sup><xref rid="fn277">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, as recorded by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;akhalot Assurot</italic> 2:18, and <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:2, this exclusion from the prohibition is limited to creatures that spawn in stationary bodies of water. According to those authorities, creatures that spawn in water that flows from a stationary collection of water are forbidden because all flowing water is encompassed within the category of &#x201C;rivers.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn278">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>To be sure, as indicated by <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> 84:30, bugs found in water flowing from a cistern through a pipe are indeed permissible since such insects have not emerged from a utensil. Accordingly, insects that spawn in the pipes that form the distribution system would appear to be permissible. However, such insects may be permissible only if the pipe is not attached to the ground. <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic>, <italic>loc. cit.</italic>, suggests that a pipe attached to the ground loses its status as a utensil and becomes an integral part of the earth to which it is attached or in which it is implanted. Accordingly, insects that spawn in such pipes, or in an aqueduct, are in the category, not of &#x201C;creeping things that creep in the water,&#x201D; but of the entirely distinct category of &#x201C;creeping things that creep on the ground.&#x201D; Creatures that do not spawn in flowing water or in utensils are creatures that &#x201C;creep on the ground&#x201D; and hence are forbidden despite the fact that they spawn in a liquid medium.</p>
<p>Furthermore, and perhaps most significantly, upon recording the permissibility of ingesting insects found in stagnant water, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:1, carefully adds, &#x201C;therefore one may <italic>bend</italic> and drink from them.&#x201D; Rema appends the explicit comment that it is forbidden to draw water in a utensil in order to drink the water drawn in such manner. As explained by <italic>Shakh</italic> and <italic>Taz, ad locum</italic>, when a utensil is used for drawing water there is a distinct possibility that the insect may attach itself to the wall of the utensil. Insects that spawn in utensils are permissible only so long as they do not emerge from their aquatic habitat. Upon attaching themselves to the wall of the utensil (for some authorities only if the insect precedes the flow of water but for other authorities even if the insect rises from the water in the utensil to the dry portion of the utensil) the insect becomes prohibited and remains so even upon its return to an aquatic environment.</p>
<p><italic>Kisei Eliyahu, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, 84:1, cited by <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> 84:9, suggests that, in actuality, the problem associated with water drawn in a utensil is a matter of practical concern only with regard to relatively large insects. <italic>Kisei Eliyahu</italic> suggests that extremely small, barely perceivable insects, once they have emerged from the water, are not capable of returning. Nevertheless <italic>Kisei Eliyahu</italic> urges that one not drink water infested even with minuscule organisms without prior straining.</p>
<p>In contradistinction to the understanding of <italic>Shakh</italic> and <italic>Taz, Darkei Teshuvah</italic> 84:13 cites <italic>Pri Tohar</italic> 84:1 who, basing himself upon <italic>Issur ve-Hetter</italic>, rules that it is permissible only to bend and drink water but that otherwise the insects, once they are removed from their original habitat even if only by means of a utensil, are forbidden. Thus, according to <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic>, if insects are present in the water, they become forbidden immediately upon being drawn into a glass or a pot.</p>
<h2>B. <italic>Insects Produced by Spontaneous Generation</italic></h2>
<p><italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 14:10, advances a further consideration that would serve effectively to prohibit imbibing any organism that spawns in reservoirs. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> assumes that the exclusion of organisms spawned in stagnant water from the prohibition concerning &#x201C;creeping things&#x201D; is based upon the rationale that they are not the product of sexual reproduction but are generated by the &#x201C;hylic power&#x201D; of the water. Otherwise, contends <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, they should be forbidden, if not by virtue of their own identity, then by virtue of the fact that they are the &#x201C;<italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic>&#x201D; or emission of a non-kosher entity and the applicable principle is that any food product that &#x201C;emerges&#x201D; from a non-kosher organism is, <italic>ipso facto</italic>, non-kosher regardless of its own characteristics.<sup><xref rid="fn279">34</xref></sup> By way of comparison, <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> points out that a fish hatched in stagnant water from an egg laid by a non-kosher mother is certainly non-kosher.<sup><xref rid="fn280">35</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>&#x2019;s position has implications beyond his actual statement. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> appears to address only the issue of the status of an organism produced by progenitors who were themselves spawned in naturally flowing bodies of water. However, if his underlying position is taken literally, <italic>viz.</italic>, that only aquatic organisms arising in stagnant water <italic>sui generis</italic> are exempt from the requirement of fins and scales, organisms that may be so categorized may well constitute a null class.</p>
<p>The Gemara, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 107b, declares that <italic>kinim</italic>, generally identified as lice, may be exterminated on <italic>Shabbat</italic> with impunity since they do not reproduce sexually. The implication is that lice are the product of spontaneous generation.<sup><xref rid="fn281">36</xref></sup> However, since the time of Pasteur, science has rejected the notion of spontaneous generation and insists that no living organisms are reproduced asexually. That perception obviously has implications with regard to the halakhic status of <italic>kinim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn282">37</xref></sup> Some scholars have taken the position that scientific reports based upon the clinical observations of researchers are unreliable and hence the Halakhah does not change.<sup><xref rid="fn283">38</xref></sup> Alternatively, it is possible to acknowledge the reliability of the scientific evidence but to recognize that the categorical proposition that no organisms can arise <italic>sui generis</italic> is an inductive generalization which may admit of exceptions and hence may not be universally correct. It may also be maintained that presently extant lice are not identical with those categorized in this manner by the Gemara and that the <italic>kinim</italic> described by the Gemara no longer exist.<sup><xref rid="fn284">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>At least one scholar, R. Isaac Lampronti, <italic>Pa&#x1E25;ad Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak, erekh &#x1E93;eidah</italic>, accepts the scientific finding negating spontaneous generation and pursues it to its logical conclusion. <italic>Pa&#x1E25;ad Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> asserts that there is no specific Oral Law tradition with regard to <italic>kinim</italic> as a particular species. <italic>Pa&#x1E25;ad Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> insists that the principle announced by the Sages is entirely correct in theory but that, empirically, the class of organisms that reproduce spontaneously may be a null class. He points to another talmudic discussion recorded in the Gemara, <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;im</italic> 94b, involving a scientific disagreement between the Sages and the &#x201C;wise men of the nations of the world&#x201D; in which the Gemara reports that R. Judah the Prince conceded that the &#x201C;wise men&#x201D; were correct and that the Sages had erred.<sup><xref rid="fn285">40</xref></sup> Accordingly, he concludes that, in light of present-day scientific knowledge, killing lice on <italic>Shabbat</italic> must be regarded as a capital offense.<sup><xref rid="fn286">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>If any one of these methods of reconciling the Gemara&#x2019;s position with regard to <italic>kinim</italic> and scientific theory is accepted and is coupled with the view expressed by <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> regarding the rationale underlying the exclusion from the requirement of fins and scales of organisms spawned in stagnant water, it follows that the provision of law formulated in <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 66b permitting such insects is a dead letter and that no such organism is permitted.</p>
<p>This writer has long contended that the halakhic principle enunciated by the Gemara with regard to lice is not intended as a literal statement with regard to reproduction. Rather, it is but another manifestation of the principle that Halakhah is predicated upon gross phenomena. As noted earlier, halakhic authorities have uniformly recognized that dietary restrictions do not apply to the imbibing of subvisual creatures. It is similarly arguable that references to regulations applicable solely to species that engage in sexual reproduction are intended as references to <italic>perceivable</italic> sexual reproduction<sup><xref rid="fn287">42</xref></sup>; hence sexual reproduction that is not perceived as such<sup><xref rid="fn288">43</xref></sup> is treated by Halakhah as if it occurred spontaneously.<sup><xref rid="fn289">44</xref></sup> Put somewhat differently, Halakhah is not based upon ontological reality but upon phenomenological perception.<sup><xref rid="fn290">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Meir Simchah ha-Kohen of Dvinsk, <italic>Meshekh &#x1E24;okhmah, Parashat Bo</italic>, cites R. Elijah of Vilna who maintains that the reasons or considerations advanced by the Sages in explanation of the various ordinances that they promulgated are not exhaustive in nature; rather, for reasons best known to themselves, they frequently reserved other considerations <italic>in pectore</italic>. In actuality, that position was formulated much earlier during the Ge&#x2019;onic period in a responsum of Rav Ha&#x2019;i Ga&#x2019;on as recorded in <italic>Teshuvot ha-Ge&#x2019;onim</italic>, ed. <italic>Meki&#x1E93;ei Nirdamim</italic> (Lych 5683-5684), no. 1.</p>
<p>In a comment published in R. Eliyahu Dessler&#x2019;s <italic>Mikhtav me-Eliyahu</italic>, IV, 355, note 4, the editor reports that Rabbi Dessler resolved the problem concerning <italic>kinim</italic> in a similar fashion: The halakhic ruling was transmitted to the Sages as a tradition received at Sinai and, although they endeavored to present a reasoned basis for that tradition, the rationale they advanced was neither exhaustive nor necessarily accurate. In his words:</p>
<p align="blockquote">The explanation does not determine the law. Rather the opposite: the law determines the explanation and the reason mentioned in the Gemara is not the sole possible reason with regard to the matter and if, at times, they presented reasons that are in accordance with the knowledge of nature of their day it is our obligation to seek other explanations in accordance with the knowledge of nature of our day by means of which the law will remain steadfast in its place.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2026; But even if a proper reason is not found, we believe with perfect faith that the law is a true law and we hope to God that He will enlighten our eyes to find an appropriate explanation.<sup><xref rid="fn291">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>If either of these theses is correct&#x2014;or if the stance that science is simply wrong is adopted&#x2014;the Halakhah with regard to exterminating <italic>kinim</italic> on <italic>Shabbat</italic> as well as the Halakhah regarding creatures spawned in stagnant water remains unchanged.</p>
<h1>IV. Bittul <italic>(Nullification)</italic></h1>
<p>Infested water might nevertheless be permissible were the principle of <italic>bittul</italic> applicable, i.e., nullification by means of adulteration in a permitted substance sixty times as great. However, despite the minuscule size of the copepods that may be present in tap water, they do not become nullified by virtue of the relatively copious quantity of water in which they are found. The most obvious consideration rendering the principle of nullification inoperative is the fact that even a tiny insect is, by definition, a &#x201C;creature&#x201D; or <italic>beriyah</italic> (but among talmudists commonly vocalized as &#x201C;<italic>biryah</italic>&#x201D; or &#x201C;<italic>beryah</italic>&#x201D;) that is not subject to nullification.<sup><xref rid="fn292">47</xref></sup> A second consideration rendering nullification inoperative is the fact that nullification occurs when the identity of the prohibited substance is lost by virtue of the fact that its identity becomes submerged in that of the overwhelmingly larger substance.<sup><xref rid="fn293">48</xref></sup> Hence, in circumstances in which the forbidden substance remains recognizable despite adulteration, it has certainly not lost its identity and hence is not subject to nullification.<sup><xref rid="fn294">49</xref></sup> R. Moshe Viya, <italic>Bedikat ha-Mazon ke-Halakhah</italic>, I (Jerusalem, 5758), p. 142, note 12, cites R. Joseph Shalom Eliashiv, R. Nissim Karelitz, R. Samuel ha-Levi Woszner and R. Ben-Zion Abba Shaul as maintaining that a forbidden substance that can be discerned only with &#x201C;great effort&#x201D; (<italic>tora&#x1E25; gadol</italic>) is not regarded as &#x201C;perceivable&#x201D; (<italic>nikar</italic>) and hence is subject to nullification provided that it is not a <italic>biryah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn295">50</xref></sup> That point is also made by R. Shlomoh Zalman Auerbach in a responsum published in that volume, pp. 178-179.<sup><xref rid="fn296">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Chaim Oberlander seems to suggest that even if it is assumed that extremely tiny insects are subject to nullification because they can be recognized only with &#x201C;great effort&#x201D; they may nevertheless not be subject to nullification for an entirely different reason. Rema, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 98:4, rules that if a small quantity of milk falls into a large pot containing a meat product the milk is not automatically nullified. Rather, cold water must be poured into the pot. The cold water will cause the milk to rise so that it may be skimmed from the top. The reason nullification of the milk does not occur is that the food is a &#x201C;<italic>davar she-yesh lo matirin</italic>,&#x201D; i.e., the principle of nullification applies only if the food cannot otherwise be eaten in a permissible manner. Since cold water will cause the milk to rise, the remaining food may be eaten in an entirely permissible manner. However, rules R. Jonathan Eibeschutz, <italic>Kereti u-Peleti, Peleti</italic> 98:61, in a situation in which food would become spoiled in the process of being mixed with cold water and thereby become inedible, the usual principle of nullification would apply. <italic>Kereti</italic>, however, apparently accepts the basic principle that prohibited substances that can be recognized only upon exertion of effort do become nullified.</p>
<p>However, <italic>Pri Megadim, Mishbe&#x1E93;ot Zahav</italic> 98:7, advances an entirely different explanation for Rema&#x2019;s ruling. <italic>Pri Megadim</italic> explains that, in the circumstances described, the milk is regarded as &#x201C;recognizable&#x201D; since it can be rendered visually perceivable by adding cold water. In effect, <italic>Pri Megadim</italic> posits that even a merely potentially recognizable entity is considered to be &#x201C;recognizable.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn297">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is, however, not at all clear that <italic>Kereti</italic> accepts the notion that nullification occurs when the prohibited substance can be recognized only with &#x201C;great effort.&#x201D; The situation involving milk falling into a pot of meat is readily distinguishable from instances in which small particles of a forbidden substance became mingled with a much greater quantity of a permitted foodstuff. In the former case the milk is presently not at all recognizable; unless and until cold water is added to the mixture it is impossible to detect the presence of milk. In the latter case, the exceedingly small forbidden entities can presently be detected, albeit only with great effort, upon meticulous sifting and scrutiny. The milk may be subject to nullification since it is presently entirely undetectable whereas the minute but detectable particles may not be subject to nullification.<sup><xref rid="fn298">53</xref></sup> Indeed, R. Jonathan Eibeschutz himself, <italic>Peleti</italic> 84:19, rules that a forbidden substance, when recognizable, is not subject to nullification even if it can be recognized only upon exertion of great effort. That is also the view of <italic>Pri Megadim, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah, Siftei Da&#x2019;at</italic> 84:35 and <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 14:6.<sup><xref rid="fn299">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, R. Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E92;ema&#x1E25; &#x1E92;edek, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 70, asserts that a forbidden substance that can be recognized only upon &#x201C;great effort&#x201D; does become nullified. That is apparently also the position of <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 100:7. Rabbi Viya, <italic>Bedikat ha-Mazon ke-Hilkhatah</italic>, I, 7: introd., note 1, states that a similar conclusion can be inferred from the discussions of <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</italic>, I, no. 259 and R. Chaim Halberstam, <italic>Teshuvot Divrei &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, II, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 54.</p>
<p>Even more akin to the case at hand is the ruling of <italic>Issur ve-Hetter</italic> 32:9, cited by <italic>Darkei Mosheh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 104:1, to the effect that a prohibited substance that falls into a liquid but which can be removed by straining is not subject to nullification. Copepods can readily be eliminated from the tap water by means of filtration.</p>
<h1>V. <italic>Boiled Water and Cooked Food</italic></h1>
<p>There are, however, circumstances in which <italic>bittul</italic>, or nullification, may be applicable. With regard to fruit that requires examination for possible insect infestation, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:9, rules that, if the unexamined fruit has been cooked in a manner that renders subsequent examination impossible, <italic>post factum</italic>, the cooked fruit is permissible. As explained by <italic>Shakh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:29, that ruling is predicated upon the principle of <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> or &#x201C;double doubt,&#x201D; i.e. first, the presence of an insect is doubtful and secondly, even if present, it is possible that the insect has been crushed and hence has become nullified in the larger quantity of permissible foodstuff. Citing earlier sources, <italic>Shakh</italic> concludes that, in a locale in which infestation by insects has been established &#x201C;<italic>hu&#x1E25;zeku</italic>,&#x201D; the presence of insects in the fruit must be regarded as tantamount to a certainty and hence the food is forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn300">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, <italic>Taz, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:17, disagrees with <italic>Shakh</italic> in maintaining that, upon cooking, the foodstuff is permissible even if it is known that such fruit is commonly infested. According to <italic>Taz</italic>, even if there is but a &#x201C;remote possibility&#x201D; (<italic>&#x1E93;ad ra&#x1E25;ok</italic>) that no insect was present, the food is permissible on the basis of the principle of <italic>sefek sefeika</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn301">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Oberlander seeks to relate that controversy to the situation of unexamined water used for cooking. Applying the principle of <italic>sefek sefeika</italic>, he asserts that the cooked food is permissible. Even in situations in which the presence of copepods is widespread, the cooked food or boiled water, he argues, is permissible according to <italic>Taz</italic>. However, in the opinion of this writer that conclusion is not warranted. It is surely the case that insects typically found in fruit quite often become crushed or dismembered in the process of cooking; hence the status of such an organism in food that has been cooked is indeed a matter of doubt. There is, however, to the best of this writer&#x2019;s knowledge, no evidence that such crushing takes place when extremely minuscule, barely visible organisms (such as copepods) find their way into a pot. Such tiny creatures, it would seem, will remain intact unless a concerted effort is made finely to grind the food in question. Accordingly, insofar as use of boiled water for tea, coffee and the like is concerned, there is no reason to assume that any organism becomes crushed in the boiling process. Moreover, as noted by <italic>Teshuvot Maharam Lublin</italic>, no. 27, as well as by R. Samuel Landau, <italic>Teshuvot Shivat &#x1E92;ion</italic>, no. 28, and <italic>Teshuvot Rav Pe&#x2019;alim</italic>, IV, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 8, although in cooking, a process in which food is often rinsed by hand and stirred by means of a cooking utensil, there is a realistic likelihood that any organism present may become crushed, such crushing is not likely to occur when water is simply boiled in a kettle or a pot.</p>
<p>Indeed, R. Yitzchak Bistritsky, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, p. 203, reports that, after boiling water for three quarters of an hour, he found copepods that were completely intact.<sup><xref rid="fn302">57</xref></sup> Hence, empirically, there is no <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> that would render such cooked food permissible. Moreover, as Rabbi Oberlander himself notes, tea or coffee can readily be strained even after it has been fully prepared. Obviously, although it is not permitted to cook forbidden objects in reliance upon nullification, coffee that has already been brewed by a method in which a filter is employed is permissible.</p>
<h1>VI. <italic>Use of Filters on</italic> Shabbat</h1>
<p>Use on <italic>Shabbat</italic> of a faucet to which a filter has been attached presents an entirely different problem. Removal of an insect from a food product or from a beverage on <italic>Shabbat</italic> presents a problem of <italic>borer</italic>, i.e., the prohibited &#x201C;selection&#x201D; or removal of a waste product or undesired object, e.g., from food to be eaten or from other objects to be used for some other purpose. Ordinarily, an insect might be removed together with a small quantity of the food or beverage in which it is found rather than in isolation. Since a portion of the perfectly desirable foodstuff is removed together with the disdained entity, the separation remains incomplete and hence permissible. However, a filter will remove only the insect as well as any other fragments of undesired dross. Hence the problem of <italic>borer</italic>, or impermissible separation, arises.</p>
<p>The problem, however, exists only if there is a desire and need to achieve a separation. A person who does not suspect the presence of a forbidden organism and who would be perfectly willing to drink unfiltered water may open a faucet to which a filter has been attached. By the same token, there is no problem with using filtered water for washing one&#x2019;s hands on <italic>Shabbat</italic> since there is no reason to be concerned with the presence of insects in water used for that purpose. A similar problem is identified by R. Joshua Neuwirth, <italic>Shemirat Shabbat ke-Hilkhatah</italic>, I, 3:56, note 163, who reports that R. Shlomoh Zalman Auerbach expressed astonishment at the use of a filter on the first and last days of <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;</italic> by individuals concerned with regard to possible contamination of the water supply by <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic>.</p>
<p>Comprehensive discussions of the issues involved in straining water on <italic>Shabbat</italic> are presented by R. Chaim Oberlander and R. Joel ha-Levi Rosner in the Tishri 5765 issue of <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn303">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>The issue of straining water on <italic>Shabbat</italic> for a comparable purpose was first addressed by <italic>Kaf ha-&#x1E24;ayyim, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 319:120. <italic>Kaf ha-&#x1E24;ayyim</italic> ruled that, in Jerusalem, water might be strained on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. Apparently, during the period in which that work was written, there was concern that insects might be present in the Jerusalem water supply. However, even if present, those insects were not forbidden aquatic creatures since they spawned in cisterns. The concern was solely due to the fact that consumption of insects is revolting to most people and hence is forbidden by virtue of the prohibition &#x201C;You shall not make yourselves repulsive&#x201D; (Leviticus 11:43). However, that prohibition is operative only if the presence of insects is known with certainty; if their presence is merely doubtful there is no revulsion attendant upon drinking the water. Basically, <italic>Kaf ha-&#x1E24;ayyim</italic>&#x2019;s position is that, if straining is required as a matter of Halakhah, it is forbidden on <italic>Shabbat</italic> but, if straining is not normatively required, it is permissible. However, in a subsequent comment, <italic>Kaf ha-&#x1E24;ayyim, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 319: 223, cites earlier authorities who ruled that straining is indeed required. Nevertheless, <italic>Kaf ha-&#x1E24;ayyim</italic> permits straining on <italic>Shabbat</italic> with the stipulation that the straining be performed by two persons acting simultaneously and that the straining be performed in an unusual manner.</p>
<p>R. Abraham Chaim Noe, <italic>Ke&#x1E93;ot ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, IV, 125:14, <italic>Badei ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, no. 37, cites <italic>&#x1E24;ayyei Adam, Hilkhot Shabbat, Nishmat Adam</italic> 16:5, who suggests that it may be permissible to strain insects that are not repulsive on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. Rabbi Noe asserts that, since the individual has no personal desire to effect the separation but rather the sole consideration motivating a person not to imbibe such insects is the prohibition attendant upon them, there is no prohibition of <italic>borer</italic>. The argument is that the prohibition is attendant only upon separation of something that is not desired from something that is desired. The insects in question are neither objectively nor subjectively undesirable for any mundane reason; they are eschewed only because of concern lest a halakhic prohibition be violated. Selection and separation on the basis of a consideration that is best described as metaphysical, he argues, does not entail a forbidden act of <italic>borer</italic>. However, <italic>Nishmat Adam</italic> regards that distinction as questionable.<sup><xref rid="fn304">59</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Ke&#x1E93;ot ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> observes that whether or not insects are present in the water is itself a matter of empirical doubt. Consequently, <italic>Ke&#x1E93;ot ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> concludes that, according to <italic>Nishmat Adam</italic>, straining on <italic>Shabbat</italic> would be permissible on the basis of the principle of <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> or &#x201C;double doubt.&#x201D; The identical consideration would render filtering New York City water on <italic>Shabbat</italic> permissible since at any given time the presence of insects is doubtful. The &#x201C;double doubt&#x201D; lies in the combination of the doubt with regard to the fact, i.e., the presence of copepods, and the halakhic doubt regarding the permissibility of straining such copepods on <italic>Shabbat</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Ke&#x1E93;ot ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, however, draws an inference from a ruling of <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh ha-Rav, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 319:23, that serves to establish that straining on <italic>Shabbat</italic> is forbidden even if the purpose is to remove insects that are not repulsive. On the basis of that inference, <italic>Ke&#x1E93;ot ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> rules contrary to the position of <italic>Nishmat Adam</italic>. The source for the ruling that a foodstuff not intrinsically disdained, but rejected only because of its nature as a halakhically prohibited substance, is not subject to the prohibition of <italic>borer</italic> is a statement of <italic>Magen Avraham, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 500:12, with regard to separation of prohibited fat (<italic>&#x1E25;elev</italic>) from meat on <italic>Shabbat</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn305">60</xref></sup> A similar statement made in a different context appears in <italic>Magen Avraham</italic> 466:8. <italic>Ke&#x1E93;ot ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> observes that <italic>Magen Avraham</italic>&#x2019;s ruling is limited to situations in which both the separated portion and the consumed portion are of the same species, e.g., both are meat, and hence fungible other than because of the prohibition.<sup><xref rid="fn306">61</xref></sup> However, insects and water are intrinsically different substances and hence, asserts <italic>Ke&#x1E93;ot ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, even if insects are eschewed only because of an attendant prohibition, the restriction of <italic>borer</italic> applies.</p>
<p><italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim: Mo&#x2019;ed</italic> 53, suggests that a filter may be used on <italic>Shabbat</italic> to assure that insects are not present in water flowing from the faucet on condition that the glass or container in which the water is collected be removed from the faucet before the spigot is turned off so that a portion of the water filtered in that manner is wasted in the act of filtration.<sup><xref rid="fn307">62</xref></sup> However, <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> concludes that the expedient is of no avail if the water is infested by &#x201C;many&#x201D; insects.<sup><xref rid="fn308">63</xref></sup> Nevertheless, R. Yitzchak Ya&#x2019;akov Weisz, <italic>Teshuvot Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>, VII, no. 23, advises that the expedient suggested by <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> be employed on <italic>Shabbat</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn309">64</xref></sup></p>
<h1>VII. <italic>Concluding Comments</italic></h1>
<p>During the period in which the attention of some sectors of the Jewish community in New York City was focused upon possible halakhic problems regarding drinking water the parasitic disease section of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention engaged in an active campaign to inform the public of potential health hazards associated with swimming in any body of water. The concern of the Centers for Disease Control focused upon swimming pools because of the prevalence of a parasite called cryptosporidium that may be responsible for eye, skin and respiratory infections as well as for gastrointestinal disorders.<sup><xref rid="fn310">65</xref></sup> Clearly, swimming pools are not risk free.</p>
<p>Nor is New York City drinking water free of contaminations that pose risks to human health. In the <italic>New York City 2003 Drinking Water Supply Quality Report</italic> published by the Department of Environmental Protection that city agency advised that a significant majority of water samples taken from the Kensico Reservoir and the New Croton Reservoir were positive for giardia and cyptosporidium, microscopic pathogens that may cause intestinal illness.<sup><xref rid="fn311">66</xref></sup> The DEP advises that immuno-compromised persons, such as patients undergoing chemotherapy, transplant recipients, persons suffering from Crohn&#x2019;s disease or HIV, as well as the elderly and infants &#x201C;should seek advice from their health care providers about their drinking water.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn312">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the same document, the DEP reports that treatment of water with chlorine to destroy microorganisms results in the forming of haloacetic acids and concludes with the following observation:</p>
<p align="blockquote">New York State requires the following statement: <italic>Some studies of people who drank chlorinated drinking water for 20 to 30 years show that long-term exposure to disinfection by-products (possibly including haloacetic acids) is associated with an increased risk for certain types of cancer. However, how long and how frequently people actually drank the water as well as how much haloacetic acids the water contained is not known for certain. Therefore, we do not know for sure if the observed increased risk for cancer is due to halaoacetic acids, other disinfection by-products, or some other factors. The individual haloacetic acids dichloracetic acid and trichloroacetic acid cause cancer in laboratory animals exposed to high levels over their lifetimes. Dichloroacetic acid and trichloroacetic acid are also known to cause other effects in laboratory animals after high levels of exposure, primarily on the liver, kidney and nervous system and on their ability to bear healthy offspring. Chemicals that cause effects in animals after high levels of exposure may pose a risk to humans exposed to similar or lower levels over long periods of time.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn313">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Certainly the authors of that material do not anticipate, nor do they desire, that all readers immediately desist from utilizing New York water for drinking purposes. The physicians and epidemiologists employed by the Centers for Disease Control find it their duty to make the public mindful of potential harm so that individual members of society may make their own determinations with regard to the risks they are willing to assume.</p>
<p>The United States has difficulty exporting its grain to European countries because of a perceived danger associated with genetically engineered food products. One need only enter any supermarket to observe organically grown produce and non-organically grown produce displayed side by side. The price discrepancy between organic and non-organic fruits and vegetables is justified solely on the basis of the fact that organic produce is free of carcinogens associated with pesticides. Obviously, some consumers are willing to pay a premium for avoidance of even a slight health risk. Dentists routinely seek a full set of x-rays of a patient&#x2019;s teeth annually. Some patients just as routinely decline the potential benefit of dental x-rays despite the low dose of the radiation involved because the effects of radiation are cumulative over a lifetime and no one has definitively established an absolutely safe threshold.</p>
<p>There is little question that in each of these cases the risk involved is well within the category of &#x201C;<italic>shomer petai&#x2019;im Ha-Shem</italic>&#x2014;the Lord pre-serves the simple&#x201D; (Psalms 116:6)<sup><xref rid="fn314">69</xref></sup> and hence is halakhically acceptable. But to say that a specific form of conduct is halakhically acceptable is not to say that it is sagacious or even prudent. Some people are more prudent than others; some are more open to risk-taking than others. Such variations of temperament serve to explain why two equally intelligent individuals may make different choices with regard to assumption of minimal, albeit real, risk of life or well-being. Where real risks exist, or when the absence of risk cannot reasonably be excluded, a person who seeks to avoid the risk in question is neither neurotic nor irrational and should not be regarded in that light by a person willing to assume the risk, just as a person who is willing to accept a degree of risk associated with an unsecured financial venture in return for the anticipation of a higher return on his investment should not be regarded as irrational by a person who willingly forgoes a higher return in favor of guaranteed preservation of capital.</p>
<p>The same is true with regard to potential transgression and its attendant spiritual harm. Halakhah generally forbids even acts that are doubtfully forbidden. However, again generally speaking, when the chance of transgression is remote, Halakhah does not forbid such acts. Nevertheless, concerned individuals to whom the onus of transgression is as serious as is the fear of bodily harm will refrain from acts that harbor even the possibility of transgression.</p>
<p>It seems to this writer that this is the thrust of the remarks of R. Moshe Chaim Luzzato, <italic>Mesilat Yesharim</italic>, chap. 14. The topic addressed by <italic>Mesilat Yesharim</italic> is &#x201C;<italic>perishut</italic>,&#x201D; literally, asceticism. Asceticism is certainly not an ideal in Judaism. Yet certain forms of self-denial are regarded as salutary. One of those is identified by <italic>Mesilat Yesharim</italic> as &#x201C;<italic>perishut be-dinim</italic>&#x201D; or &#x201C;asceticism with regard to laws.&#x201D; As <italic>Mesilat Yesharim</italic> explains, persons who eschew certain pleasures or benefits because of fear of transgression, even when Halakhah does not mandate such a high state of vigilance, act in a commendable manner.</p>
<p>In small towns in Europe inhabitants not only raised chickens for food but often maintained cows in their backyards in order to obtain milk. R. Israel Meir ha-Kohen, the <italic>&#x1E24;afe&#x1E93; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, also kept a cow for that purpose. Members of <italic>&#x1E24;afe&#x1E93; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>&#x2019;s family relate that one day he suddenly stopped drinking milk or eating any dairy products prepared from milk given by that cow. When questioned about the sudden change in his eating practices, <italic>&#x1E24;afe&#x1E93; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> turned a deaf ear and refused to respond. Repeated questioning elicited only adamant refusal to answer. Eventually, the cow stopped giving milk. Since there was no longer any reason to maintain the cow it was slaughtered. Lo and behold, upon examination by the <italic>sho&#x1E25;et</italic>, adhesions were found on the lungs and the cow was pronounced non-kosher. Suddenly, <italic>&#x1E24;afe&#x1E93; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>&#x2019;s earlier demurral to drink milk derived from the cow became cogent: the milk of a non-kosher animal is non-kosher.</p>
<p>How did <italic>&#x1E24;afe&#x1E93; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> become aware of the fact that his cow had developed adhesions? Certainly not on the basis of some prophetic inspiration. Had such information been revealed to him, presumably he would have been duty-bound to inform his family so that they not inadvertently fall into transgression.<sup><xref rid="fn315">70</xref></sup> There is a quite simple explanation for <italic>&#x1E24;afe&#x1E93; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>&#x2019;s behavior. As animals age, they, no less so than humans, become prone to illness. <italic>&#x1E24;afe&#x1E93; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> realized that his cow had reached a stage in bovine life at which disease and illness were more than remote possibilities. Concern for his spiritual welfare caused him to eschew milk that might be tainted with even the suspicion of spiritual harm. Was he halakhically required to act as he did? Certainly not. Unless empirically rebutted, the halakhic presumption that the majority of animals are not <italic>tereifot</italic> applies even to aging animals. <italic>&#x1E24;afe&#x1E93; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>&#x2019;s avoidance of the milk of that particular cow reflected a finely-honed sensitivity to the possibility of transgression.</p>
<p>The concern with regard to New York water is far more profound. It is quite conceivable that, at least in some neighborhoods, the incidence of infestation does not rise to a level that serves to generate a halakhic concern. The general rule, subject to limited exceptions, is <italic>lo ma&#x1E25;azikin rei&#x2019;uta</italic>, i.e., one is not required to suspect halakhic contamination of one type or another unless there is basis for such suspicion. In the absence of halakhically recognized grounds for suspicion, subjective concern may be grounds for personal stringency but not for a normative prohibition. However, when cogent grounds for fear rising to the halakhic threshold of suspicion do exist, the obligation not to risk transgression becomes a matter of normative law. The fundamental issue with regard to New York water is whether the grounds for suspicion rise to that level.</p>
<p>An isolated sighting of a forbidden insect would not result in a mandatory requirement for examination of all water. Such an event might be dismissed as an isolated occurrence. Animals are not routinely examined upon slaughter for every possible anomaly. Since the majority of all animals are not <italic>tereifot</italic>, there is no halakhic requirement to suspect that any given animal is a member of the minority class of <italic>tereifot</italic>. However, examination of the lungs for the presence of adhesions is required despite the fact that the majority of animals do not develop disqualifying adhesions. Examination of the lungs is required because, unlike other <italic>tereifot</italic>, adhesions are present in a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic>, i.e., in a significant minority of animals.<sup><xref rid="fn316">71</xref></sup> <italic>Shakh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:28, indicates that examination of food products for the presence of insects is required as a matter of normative law if insect infestation represents a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn317">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, the crucial question with regard to whether or not a halakhic problem exists with regard to the New York water supply is whether the incidence of infestation rises to the level of a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn318">73</xref></sup> The answer is not necessarily uniform for all areas throughout the city. Some areas may be <italic>mu&#x1E25;zak be-tola&#x2019;im</italic>, i.e., they may be known to be plagued by repeated instances of infestation; other areas, and even some buildings within infested areas, may have repeatedly been shown to be free of infestation. Although copepods are known to be present in the reservoir, water in buildings shown to be free of infestation has, in effect, undergone a self-filtration process.<sup><xref rid="fn319">74</xref></sup> In this writer&#x2019;s opinion, where copepods have been found, filtration of water is certainly to be advised; in buildings shown to be free of infestation, filtration is not required.</p>

It has been asserted that there can be no halakhic problem associated with drinking New York water because innumerable glasses of water containing copepods have been consumed by pious and learned Jews over the course of decades.

<ftnote id="fn264">19. Cf., however, R. Joseph Lieberman&#x2019;s comment in one of a series of notes appended in unnumbered pages to R. Elyakim Dworkes&#x2019; <italic>Be-Shevilei ha- Parashah</italic> (Jerusalem, 5762). Basing himself upon a responsum of R. Akiva Eger published in <italic>Drush ve-&#x1E24;iddush R. Akiva Eger</italic> (New York, 5709), I, 176, Rabbi Lieberman asserts that an <italic>etrog</italic> missing a portion of its flesh must be disqualified even if that fact can be ascertained only upon magnification. R. Akiva Eger cites <italic>Magen Avraham, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 648:16, who rules that a <italic>&#x1E25;azazit</italic>, i.e., lichen or a scab on the surface of an <italic>etrog</italic>, disqualifies the <italic>etrog</italic> only if it is perceived by the eye (<italic>nireh le-ayin</italic>). R. Akiva Eger, however, asserts that <italic>Magen Avraham</italic>&#x2019;s comment is applicable only to a <italic>&#x1E25;azazit</italic> which disqualifies an <italic>etrog</italic> because the fruit is no longer <italic>hadar</italic> or &#x201C;beautiful.&#x201D; Since &#x201C;beauty&#x201D; in the first instance is literally determined by the eye of the perceiver, a blemish that cannot be perceived cannot mar the beauty of the fruit. However, asserts R. Akiva Eger, despite the terminology employed by <italic>Magen Avraham, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 648:9, when the disqualification is not because of the requirement of <italic>hadar</italic> but because of the removal or the absence (<italic>&#x1E25;aser</italic>) of a part of the <italic>etrog</italic>, the <italic>etrog</italic> is disqualified even if the affected area is much smaller. Based upon that comment, Rabbi Lieberman concludes that, according to R. Akiva Eger, halakhic determinations must take cognizance of perceptions that may be experienced only upon magnification.</ftnote>
<ftnote>However, a close reading of R. Akiva Eger&#x2019;s comments does not support that conclusion. R. Akiva Eger carefully states: &#x201C; &#x2026; whatever is actually separated and is perceived by precise placing of the eye (<italic>nireh be-simat ayin be-diyuk</italic>) is disqualified because it is <italic>&#x1E25;aser</italic>.&#x201D; R. Akiva Eger carefully speaks of &#x201C;precise placing of the eye&#x201D;&#x2014;not of artificial magnification&#x2014;as opposed to mere &#x201C;perception by the eye&#x201D;, i.e., that which can be perceived only by close scrutiny as distinct from that which strikes the eye immediately. Only a <italic>&#x1E25;azazit</italic> that &#x201C;strikes the eye&#x201D; disqualifies an <italic>etrog</italic>; one that can be detected only upon &#x201C;precise placing of the eye&#x201D; does not. In contradistinction, <italic>&#x1E25;aser</italic> is a disqualification even if the absence of a very small portion of the <italic>etrog</italic> can be determined only upon close visual scrutiny. There is, however, no reason to conclude that R. Akiva Eger would disqualify an <italic>etrog</italic> missing a portion of its flesh so minute that the imperfection can be determined only upon artificial magnification. See also R. Joseph Mashash, <italic>Teshuvot Mayim &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 259, who rules unhesitatingly that such an <italic>etrog</italic> is kosher.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn265">20. For a comprehensive survey of the bases and ramifications of those opinions see R. Jacob Gershon Weiss, <italic>Middot u-Mishkalot shel Torah</italic> (Jerusalem, 5745), pp. 198-264.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn266">21. R. Abraham Chaim Noe, <italic>Shi&#x2019;urei Torah</italic> (Jerusalem, 5707), p. 249, calculates the <italic>amah</italic>, or cubit, as 48 centimeters (18.897 inches). The identical calculation was earlier advanced by R. Shalom Mordecai Schwadron, <italic>Da&#x2019;at Torah</italic> 35:116, and <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> 19:27. Accordingly, the <italic>mil</italic>, which equals 2,000 cubits, is equal to a distance of 960 meters (3,149.60 feet). Rabbi Noe gives alternative calculations of the <italic>amah</italic> as equal to 47 centimeters (18.5 inches) or 49 centimeters (19.29 inches). The <italic>mil</italic> would then be the equivalent of 940 (3,083.98 feet) or 980 meters (3,215.22 feet).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn267">22. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish, Kuntres ha-Shi&#x2019;urin, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>: <italic>Mo&#x2019;ed</italic> 39:5-6 and 39:9, calculates the <italic>amah</italic> as 58 centimeters (22.83 inches) and, accordingly, a <italic>mil</italic> would equal 1,160 meters (3,805.77 feet). <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> also cites a report to the effect that R. Shmu&#x2019;el Salant accepted calculations that would render the <italic>amah</italic> 60 centimeters or 23.62 inches and the <italic>mil</italic> 1200 meters or 3937.01 feet. Nevertheless, for purposes of stringency, R. Shmu&#x2019;el Salant is reported to have accepted calculation that would yield 48 centimeters or 18.90 inches for the <italic>amah</italic> and 960 meters or 3149.61 feet for the <italic>mil</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Cf., R. Ya&#x2019;akov Yisra&#x2019;el Kanievsky, <italic>Shi&#x2019;urin shel Torah</italic> (Bnei Brak, 5729), who, in a note on p. 63, calculates the <italic>amah</italic> as 57 2/3 centimeters (22.70 inches) and possibly, according to Rashba, as 59.66 centimeters (23.49 inches). The <italic>mil</italic> would then be the equivalent of either a bit more than 1,153.2 meters (3,783.46 feet) or a bit more than 1,193.2 meters (3,914.6 feet). Actually, according to Rabbi Kanievsky&#x2019;s own premises, the calculation of the <italic>amah</italic> as 57 2/3 centimeters is somewhat imprecise. Rabbi Kanievsky reports that &#x201C;according to that which has been received by us from <italic>gedolei hora&#x2019;ah</italic>, that the <italic>amah</italic> equals 13 <italic>vershak</italic> &#x2026;&#x201D; The <italic>vershak</italic> is a Russian measuring length equal to 1.75 inches or 4.445 centimeters. If so an <italic>amah</italic> is the equivalent of 57.78 centimeters (22.73 inches) and thus a <italic>mil</italic> is equal to 1,155.7 meters (3,791.66 feet). See <italic>Encylopedia Britannica</italic>, 15th ed. (Chicago, 1995), XIX, 735 (where the term is transliterated as <italic>verchok</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote>A table compiled by Moshe, Rosa and Shimon Bodenheimer, <italic>Shi&#x2019;urin u-Middot &#x1E24;azal</italic> (Jerusalem, 5725), gives the measurement of the <italic>amah</italic> as 57.6 centimeters (22.67 inches). Cf., the table published by Y. Avi-Zevi, <italic>Shanah be-Shanah</italic>, 5730, p. 125, that gives the measurement of the <italic>amah</italic> as 56 centimeters and that of the <italic>mil</italic> as 1120.37 meters. Those measurements presumably reflect the view of R. Chaim Jacob Sheftel, <italic>Erekh Milin</italic> (Berditchev, 5667), <italic>erekh e&#x1E93;ba</italic>, according to whom the <italic>amah</italic> measures approximately 56 centimeters. See <italic>Encyclopedia Talmudit</italic>, II (Jerusalem, 5760), 29, note 56.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Other less frequently cited opinions with regard to the length of an <italic>amah</italic> include those of R. Naphtali Zevi Judah Berlin, <italic>Meshiv Davar</italic>, I, no. 24; <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 201:3; R. Moshe Sofer, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 181; and the earlier noted view of <italic>Erekh Milin, erekh e&#x1E93;ba</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote><italic>Meshiv Davar</italic> rejects what he terms &#x201C;the customarily accepted calculations&#x201D; according to which the length of the <italic>amah</italic> would equal 60 centimeters and advances considerations that would yield the measurement of an <italic>amah</italic> as 48 centimeters. Nevertheless, in his concluding remarks he retracts that view and advances a calculation that would result in an <italic>amah</italic> measured &#x201C;in excess of&#x201D; 48 centimeters and endorses the practice of Frankfurt am Main according to which the length of the <italic>amah</italic> is calculated as 57 centimeters or 22.44 inches.</ftnote>
<ftnote><italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> states that the length of an <italic>amah</italic> is 12 &#x201C;<italic>veierskes</italic>,&#x201D; which is apparently the Yiddish term for the Russian <italic>vershak</italic>. Thus, according to <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, the length of an <italic>amah</italic> equals 53.34 centimeters or 21.0 inches. Cf., <italic>Encylopedia Talmudit</italic>, II, 29, where the length of an <italic>amah</italic> is given as 54 centimeters according to <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote><italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> states that the length of a fingerwidth is a &#x201C;<italic>zoll</italic>.&#x201D; Since a biblical <italic>amah</italic> is equal to 24 fingerwidths, the length of an <italic>amah</italic> according to <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> equals 24 <italic>zoll</italic>. <italic>Da&#x2019;at Torah, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah, Kuntres A&#x1E25;aron</italic> 35:116 states that the <italic>zoll</italic> is equal to 2.6 centimeters. That calculation is apparently also assumed by <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> and <italic>Encyclopedia Talmudit</italic>. [Cf., however, <italic>Encyclopedia Britannica, loc. cit</italic>., which describes the <italic>zoll</italic> as a Swiss unit of measure equal to 3 centimeters. The German <italic>zoll</italic> is usually 1/12 of a foot although in some places it was 1/11 or 1/10 of a foot. The German foot varied from a minimum of 23.51 centimeters in Wesel and a maximum of 40.83 centimeters in Freier. The <italic>zoll</italic> measured 2.36 centimeters in Saxonia, 2.43 centimeters in Bavaria and 2.62 centimeters in Prussia. The <italic>zoll</italic> in Austria measured 2.65 centimeters, approximately the measurement assumed by <italic>Da&#x2019;at Torah</italic> and <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic>.] <italic>Encyclopedia Talmudit, ad locum</italic>, indicates that, according to <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, the length of an <italic>amah</italic> is 62.4 centimeters or 24.567 inches. Thus a <italic>mil</italic>, according to <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, would equal 1248.0 meters or 4094.49 feet. <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> 19:27 notes that the <italic>amah</italic> was marginally enlarged by rabbinic decree and, accordingly, should be calculated as 24 1/2 <italic>zoll</italic>. <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> endorses the position of <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> and states that the length of an <italic>amah</italic> according to <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> is 63.8 centimeters. Thus, according to <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic>, an <italic>amah</italic> equals 25.12 inches and, accordingly, a <italic>mil</italic> equals 1276 meters or 4186.35 feet. <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>&#x2019;s calculations are thus significantly greater than those of the earlier-cited authorities.</ftnote>
<ftnote><italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> also cites a certain &#x201C;Rabbi of Yasi&#x201D; who calculated the <italic>amah</italic> as &#x201C;no more than&#x201D; 52 or 53 centimeters and an anonymous scholar who differed and calculated the <italic>amah</italic> as approximately 58 1/2 centimeters. <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> also quotes <italic>She&#x2019;erit Yisra&#x2019;el, Parashat Me&#x1E93;ora</italic>, who calculates the <italic>amah</italic> as 21 1/6 <italic>zoll</italic> or 56 centimeters and further opines that one who calculates the <italic>amah</italic> as 22 1/8 <italic>zoll</italic> or 57 centimeters is to be commended. <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> cites an additional source for the latter calculation as well.</ftnote>
<ftnote><italic>Da&#x2019;at Torah, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah, Kuntres A&#x1E25;aron</italic> 35:116, cites authorities who variously posit the length of an <italic>amah</italic> as 47 centimeters, 55.25 centimeters, a bit more than 57 centimeters and 58.5 centimeters, as well as one authority who asserts that according to Rashi the <italic>amah</italic> equals 43.8 centimeters, according to <italic>Shakh</italic> 45.02 centimeters, according to <italic>Taz</italic> 47.34 centimeters and according to Rambam 50 centimeters. See also the measurements ascribed to earlier authorities by Rabbi Weiss, <italic>Middot u-Mishkalot shel Torah</italic>, pp. 198-264 as well as the table presented <italic>ibid.</italic>, introduction, p. 8. See also R. Moshe Shimshon Bacharach, <italic>&#x1E24;ut ha-Shani</italic>, no. 97.</ftnote>
<ftnote>For a table correlating many of these measurements of the <italic>amah</italic> with the volume of the liquid <italic>revi&#x2019;it</italic> see <italic>Middot u-Mishkalot shel Torah</italic>, introd., p. 8. Rabbi Kanievsky, <italic>Shi&#x2019;urin shel Torah</italic>, p. 51, cites a discussion in the Palestinian Talmud, <italic>Terumot</italic> 10:7, that is understood by some authorities, including Riva, <italic>Commentary on the Pentateuch, Parashat Mishpatim</italic>; <italic>Ma&#x2019;adanei Yom Tov, Berakhot</italic> 3:30; and <italic>Tosafot Yom Tov, Pe&#x2019;ah</italic> 6:6, as indicating that a <italic>revi&#x2019;it</italic> equals 240 grams. If so, an <italic>amah</italic> would appear to equal 73.368 centimeters or 28.885 inches. Rabbi Kanievsky categorizes that calculation of the <italic>revi&#x2019;it</italic> as &#x201C;extremely large&#x201D; and as &#x201C;not imagined by early-day authorities.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote>It may be of interest, albeit of no halakhic import, to note that, based upon Josephus&#x2019; description of the circumference of the pillars of the Temple, the renowned physicist Sir Isaac Newton postulated the length of the &#x201C;sacred&#x201D; cubit to be between 24.90 and 25.02 inches as distinct from the &#x201C;profane&#x201D; cubit of 20.63 inches that he believed was the measurement employed by the Egyptians in construction of the Great Pyramid. Newton&#x2019;s calculations are the subject of his &#x201C;De magnitudine cubiti sacri.&#x201D; An English translation of that essay titled &#x201C;A Dissertation Upon the Sacred Cubit of the Jews and the Cubit of Several Nations: in which, from the Dimensions of the Greatest Pyramid, as taken by Mr. John Greaves, the ancient Cubit of Memphis is determined&#x201D; was published in the <italic>Miscellaneous Works of John Greaves, Professor of Astronomy in the University of Oxford</italic>, ed. Thomas Birch, II (London, 1737), 405-433.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Perhaps of even greater interest is the fact that the long or royal Egyptian cubit was 20.67 inches or 52.5 centimeters in length. Specimens of that cubit are on display in the Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum as well as in the Egyptian Museum of Torino. That cubit was in use in Egypt in antiquity and was widely employed throughout the ancient world. A second unit of measure, known as the short cubit, equaling 45 centimeters or approximately 18 inches, was also used at that time. For an interesting discussion of those measurements and archaeological evidence that the Temple Mount measured 500 x 500 long cubits see Leen Ritmeyer, <italic>The Quest: Revealing the Temple Mount in Jerusalem</italic> (Jerusalem, 2006), p. 170.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn268">23. In absolute terms, the distance a person possessing normal vision is capable of seeing with the naked eye is limited primarily by the curvature of the earth. Thus, when vision is not obstructed, a five-foot-tall person standing at sea level can perceive objects, at least faintly, over a distance of 4.5 kilometers or 2.8 miles. See <italic>Encyclopedia Britannica</italic>, VI, 60. According to all calculations, the distance subject to a shepherd&#x2019;s surveillance is much less. Presumably, then, contemporary inability to see objects at such a distance is due to atmospheric conditions, including, particularly in inhabited areas, pollution, rather than diminished visual prowess.</ftnote>

Moshe Feinstein, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, IV, no. 2, &#x201C;<italic>she-efshar she-davar she-lo nireh le-ma&#x2019;aseh le-einayim eino assur</italic>&#x2014;it is possible that something that cannot actually be seen by the eye is not forbidden,&#x201D; that continues to declare &#x201C;<italic>u-le-khol ha-pa&#x1E25;ot eino be-&#x1E25;ashivut biryah</italic>&#x2014;and at the very minimum does not have the status of a <italic>biryah</italic>.&#x201D; See <italic>infra</italic>, notes 50 and 51, and accompanying text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn273">28. As noted <italic>supra</italic>, note 16, <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> does indeed endorse the view that microscopic organisms that could not have been visually perceived were not banned at Mount Sinai. Accordingly, he as well as the other authorities who rule that even creatures that cannot be readily identified as insects are prohibited, must be understood as maintaining that visual perception of such creatures as &#x201C;black dots&#x201D; creates a <italic>safek</italic>, or doubt, and as such are subject to the rules governing doubtful situations. Moreover, since the &#x201C;doubt&#x201D; is perceived and can now readily be resolved by means of magnification, this &#x201C;doubt&#x201D; can no longer be willfully ignored. That consideration is sufficient to prohibit ingesting such creatures. See R. Chaim Chizkiyahu Medini, <italic>Sedei &#x1E24;emed</italic>, V, <italic>Kellalim, ma&#x2019;arekhet ha-samakh, klal</italic> 51.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn274">29. <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:36, rules that insects are forbidden even if they are visible only when scrutinized in direct sunlight. R. Shlomoh Zalman Auerbach, <italic>Halikhot Sadeh</italic>, no. 51, indicates that this is the case even if the insects can be seen only by employing an electric light.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn275">30. See <italic>Kashrus Magazine</italic>, July, 2004, p. 376. See also R. Ephraim Zalman Margulies, <italic>Teshuvot Bet Efrayim ha-&#x1E24;adashot</italic>, no. 62, cited in <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> 84:28, who suggests that minuscule creatures having the appearance of &#x201C;thin, moving kernels of wheat&#x201D; are permissible because, in reality, they are not insects but nascent fishlings. There is no hint in that source that inability visually to identify those creatures as insects should in any way be a consideration. Cf., also, R. Chaim Halberstam, <italic>Teshuvot Divrei &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, II, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 54, who rejects the position of <italic>Bet Efrayim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn276">31. See, for example, <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> 84:26-27. For the status of the water remaining in a reservoir that overflows its banks see <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> 84:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Most significantly, since the water flows out of the reservoir into the distribution system, the reservoir cannot be deemed to be a pit of stagnant water. See Ra&#x2019;avad, <italic>Sifri</italic>, <italic>Parashat Shemini</italic> 3:2; <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, II, no. 30; and <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> 84:6. There appears to be no distinction in this regard between a situation in which the water flows naturally into a canal and a situation in which the flow is controlled by man, i.e., by means of outflow valves, as in the case of a reservoir. Thus the statement published in the <italic>Yated Ne&#x2019;eman, supra</italic>, note 5, indicating that the reservoirs in question have the status of rivers is entirely correct. In that ruling, Rabbi Feinstein, in accordance with the view cited, <italic>infra</italic>, note 33, states that the outflow system is sufficient to guarantee that status and adds that, since the reservoir is fed by flowing water, it must be regarded as having both an inflow and an outflow and hence must be deemed a &#x201C;river&#x201D; according to all authorities even though the water appears to be stationary. Cf., <italic>Sha&#x2019;ashu&#x2019;ei Oraita</italic>, p. 156.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn277">32. A publication of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, &#x201C;Copepods in New York City Drinking Water&#x201D; (July, 2004), p. 3, states that copepods &#x201C;are found almost everywhere where water is available&#x201D; and that &#x201C;various species can be found in all kinds of freshwater habitats from small creeks to glacial lakes.&#x201D; Cyclops and other copepods that are predominant in New York water are limnetic, i.e., they live in open areas of still bodies of water. These species are not endemic to fast moving mountain streams or rivers and hence must breed in the reservoirs or at some point beyond the reservoir in the distribution system. See &#x201C;Copepods in NYC Tap Water,&#x201D; p. 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn278">33. See <italic>Shakh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:8; <italic>Pri Megadim, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah, Siftei Da&#x2019;at</italic> 84:8; and <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, II, no. 30. Cf., however, <italic>Tosafot, &#x1E24;ullin</italic> 67a, s.v. <italic>ba-mayim</italic>; Rosh, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 3:68; and <italic>Teshuvot Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 27, who rule that such insects are permitted.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Rabbi Raitport&#x2019;s major argument for permitting Brooklyn water in which such insects are found is that Brooklyn water is derived from the Catskill/Delaware System which receives its water from reservoirs in the Catskill Mountains. Rabbi Raitport received a letter from the Assistant Director of the New York State Bureau of Water Supply Protection informing him that those reservoirs are &#x201C;recharged by rainfall and snowmelt from the Catskill Mountain&#x201D; area but have &#x201C;no river intakes.&#x201D; See <italic>Teshuvah Halakhah le-Ma&#x2019;aseh</italic>, p. 37. Rabbi Raitport develops the novel thesis that, for the insects to be prohibited, the stagnant water must not only flow out but water must also flow into the stagnant area. See <italic>ibid</italic>., pp. 18-19. That thesis, however, is contradicted by numerous sources, including Ra&#x2019;avad, <italic>Sifri, Parashat Shemini</italic> 3:2; <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, II, no. 30; as well as <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> 84:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Moreover, the empirical premise upon which this argument is based is incorrect. The reservoirs in question are indeed &#x201C;recharged by rainfall and snowmelt.&#x201D; However, the rainwater and melting snow are first absorbed by the ground and form aquifiers which, in turn, form springs that flow into the reservoirs. See &#x201C;Copepods in NYC Tap Water,&#x201D; p. 15. Such springs clearly do not have the status of rainwater. See R. Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E92;ema&#x1E25; &#x1E92;edek, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 176 and R. Naphtali Zevi Judah Berlin, <italic>Teshuvot Meshiv Davar</italic>, II, no. 41.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn279">34. That argument has no validity if the highly novel thesis of the <italic>Brisker Rav</italic>, R. Yitzchak Ze&#x2019;ev Soloveichik, is accepted. The <italic>Brisker Rav</italic> observes that, insofar as other members of the animal kingdom are concerned, the presence or absence of the criteria recorded in Scripture as distinguishing kosher species from non-kosher species is irrelevant with regard to determining the status of any individual contemporary animal. That point is evidenced by the rule that pronounces a pig born of a sheep to be a kosher animal while a lamb born of a pig to be non-kosher. See <italic>Bekhorot</italic> 5b. The principle of <italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic> defines membership in a species on the basis of the identity of the progenitor, or of the progenitors, of the animal in question. The anatomical criteria spelled out in Scripture are significant only in establishing the identity of the early progenitors of present-day animals. Not so with regard to &#x201C;creeping things that creep on the ground,&#x201D; asserts the <italic>Brisker Rav</italic>. In that context, he observes, Scripture fails to provide anatomical criteria and omits the phrase &#x201C;according to their species.&#x201D; Hence the <italic>kashrut</italic> of those creatures is determined by classification of each individual member of those species on the basis of its appearance (<italic>to&#x2019;ar</italic>) as a &#x201C;creeping thing.&#x201D; The <italic>Brisker Rav</italic> makes the same assertion with regard to &#x201C;creeping things that creep on the ground.&#x201D; In support of that position he cites Rambam&#x2019;s formulation of the prohibition in <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;akhalot Assurot</italic> 2:23 and his ruling in <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;akhalot Assurot</italic> 3:8 as well as the midrashic statement indicating that it was necessary for God to demonstrate a &#x201C;creeping thing&#x201D; to Moses in order for him properly to apprehend the characteristics of the prohibited species. This principle also seems to be reflected in Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;akhalot Assurot</italic> 2:12. See <italic>&#x1E24;iddushei ha-Griz al ha-Shas</italic>, ed. Y. Cohen (Jerusalem, 5729), p. 259. Cf., the terminology employed by Rambam, <italic>Guide of the Perplexed</italic>, III, chap. 48, which does not necessarily contradict this thesis. For a fuller discussion see this writer&#x2019;s <italic>Be-Netivot ha-Halakhah</italic>, I (New York, 5756), 132-133. Since &#x201C;creeping things&#x201D; do not acquire their status from their progenitors but are classified as kosher or non-kosher solely on the basis of their individual criteria, it should logically follow that organisms spawned in stagnant water are always permitted since 1) they are excluded from the requirement of fins and scales and 2) since there is no reference to identification &#x201C;according to their species,&#x201D;the identity of their progenitors is irrelevant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn280">35. See the novel thesis advanced by the <italic>Brisker Rav</italic> cited <italic>supra</italic>, note 34. The <italic>Brisker Rav</italic> would certainly concede <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>&#x2019;s halakhic conclusion since <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> explicitly limits his thesis to species having the appearance of &#x201C;creeping things&#x201D; but not to fish whose status Scripture predicates upon the criteria of fins and scales. See also <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 75 and <italic>Be-Netivot ha-Halakhah</italic>, p. 132. According to the <italic>Brisker Rav</italic>, the argument would be that the exclusion from the requirement for fins and scales is intrinsically limited to organisms that spawn in stagnant water and does not extend to organisms generated by sexual reproduction.</ftnote>

<ftnote>In a non-halakhic context R.

<ftnote id="fn283">38. See, for example, the opinion of R. Yehudah Brill, cited by R.

<ftnote>In another comment, Rabbi Brill suggests that the premise of the Sages is not contradicted by contemporary science. If my reading of that passage is correct, Rabbi Brill maintains that the original <italic>kinim</italic> were generated from &#x201C;sweat&#x201D; but now reproduce sexually. If so, he ascribes to the Sages the novel position that even sexually reproduced progeny of spontaneously-generated creatures are excluded from the <italic>Shabbat</italic> prohibition. On that analysis the Sages posited spontaneous generation only of primordial creatures at the time of creation.</ftnote>

<ftnote>Neither the thesis that there are exceptional species in which spontaneous generation is present nor the thesis that the <italic>kinim</italic> described by the Gemara are no longer extant resolves the broader problem posed by Rambam&#x2019;s comments in <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;akhalot Assurot</italic> 2:13:</ftnote>
<p align="blockquote">The species which originate in dust heaps and carcasses, such as maggots, worms and their like and which are born, not through intercourse between male and female, but out of putrefaction of dung and the like are called &#x201C;<italic>creeping things that move upon the earth</italic>&#x201D; (Leviticus 11:44). &#x2026; On the other hand, &#x201C;<italic>all creeping things that creep upon the earth</italic>&#x201D; (Leviticus 11:42) refers to such that procreate by intercourse between male and female.</p>
<ftnote>Rambam describes two dichotomous classes of &#x201C;creeping things,&#x201D; each subject to its own separate prohibition: those that procreate sexually and those generated by putrefaction. According to Rambam, <italic>kinim</italic> are not to be identified as members of an idiosyncratic and perhaps exotic species but are merely paradigmatic of the multitude of tiny organisms that do not reproduce sexually but arise out of putrid substances.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn288">43. The Gemara, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 107b, questions the statement that <italic>kinim</italic> do not reproduce sexually on the basis of the dictum &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He, sits and sustains [all creatures] from the horns of the eggs of <italic>kinim</italic>&#x201D; or, according to Rashi, &#x201C;tiny <italic>kinim</italic> as they emerge from the eggs.&#x201D; Ostensibly, the Gemara finds evidence that <italic>kinim</italic> reproduce sexually in the employment of the term &#x201C;eggs of <italic>kinim</italic>&#x201D; in the dictum. If so, it might be argued that, if the sexual nature of reproduction was acknowledged by the Gemara in its original contention but purported to be subvisual, the term &#x201C;eggs of <italic>kinim</italic>&#x201D; might be understood as referring to microscopic eggs and should not have been regarded as anomalous.</ftnote>
<ftnote>It may be countered that, even if the thesis of spontaneous generation is understood literally, there is no reason to presume that <italic>kinim</italic> arise spontaneously as mature creatures. Certainly, divine providence would perforce necessarily extend even to spontaneously generated <italic>kinim</italic>. If so, God&#x2019;s providence would indeed be necessary regardless of whether or not eggs of <italic>kinim</italic> are visually perceivable and regardless of whether or not they can be perceived as reproducing sexually. How then, does the cited dictum negate the assertion that <italic>kinim</italic> are the product of spontaneous generation?</ftnote>
<ftnote>The Gemara&#x2019;s objection is indeed based upon employment of the phrase &#x201C;eggs of <italic>kinim</italic>&#x201D; but the objection need not be understood as based upon the literal description of <italic>kinim</italic> as arising from eggs and hence the conclusion that they are sexually reproduced; rather, the objection is that the dictum indicates that divine providence is perceived by man as being exercised over development of those minuscule eggs, thereby indicating that the reproductive process is entirely usual, i.e., sexual in nature and perceived as such.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn289">44. If this analysis is correct, the <italic>kinim</italic> described by the Gemara cannot be identical to present-day head lice since eggs of the latter species are clearly visible to the naked eye.</ftnote>

<ftnote>It should be noted that <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 100:17, declares that repulsive creatures (<italic>devarim ma&#x2019;usim</italic>) such as &#x201C;flies and ants&#x201D; are nullified when mixed with foods sixty times greater in quantity even if a whole insect is present in the mixture. However, Rabbi Gross, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, p. 198, correctly points out that <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 100:1, declares, &#x201C;A <italic>biryah</italic>, that is, an ant etc., is not nullified even [in food] a thousand times [as great].&#x201D; That statement is in direct contradiction to the ruling of <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Nevertheless, it should further be noted that R. Abraham Benjamin Samuel Sofer<italic>, Teshuvot Ketav Sofer, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 63, cites early-day authorities who maintain that a <italic>biryah</italic> is nullified when adulterated in 960 parts of a permissible foodstuff and rules that, although that opinion is not normative, all authorities would agree that a <italic>biryah</italic> that is itself disdainful (<italic>pegumah</italic>) becomes nullified in such a quantity of permissible food.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn296">51. In his contribution to <italic>Halikhot Sadeh</italic>, no. 51, mentioned earlier, R. Shlomoh Zalman Auerbach states that an extremely small insect, although biblically prohibited, is not deemed to be a <italic>biryah</italic> and hence is subject to nullification. A <italic>biryah</italic> is not nullified because of its significance, but such minuscule creatures, he contends, are insignificant. See <italic>Rosh Yosef, &#x1E24;ullin</italic> 96b. However, Rabbenu Nissim asserts that a <italic>biryah</italic> is not subject to nullification because its significance stems from the fact that consumption of a <italic>biryah</italic> is subject to statutory punishment despite its small size. Accordingly, concludes R. Schneur Zalman Revach, <italic>Tola&#x2019;at Shani</italic> (Bet Uzi&#x2019;el, 5767), I, no. 4, even the smallest prohibited insect cannot be nullified.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn297">52. Rashba, <italic>Torat ha-Bayit, bayit dalet, sha&#x2019;ar dalet</italic>, rules that a non-kosher pot that becomes mingled with a larger number of kosher pots becomes nullified. Even though the pot can be rendered permissible by means of a <italic>kashering</italic> process, that procedure is not required because of the expense and labor entailed in such a procedure. R. Aaron ha-Levi, <italic>Bedek ha-Bayit, ad locum</italic>, disagrees and rules that, since the prohibited substance absorbed in the walls of the utensil can be purged by <italic>kashering</italic>, that substance is regarded as recognizable and hence not subject to nullification. That dispute is mirrored in a controversy between <italic>Shakh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 102:8 and <italic>&#x1E24;avvat Da&#x2019;at, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 102:3. A similar dispute exists between <italic>Pri &#x1E24;adash, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 102:8, who regards nullification to be efficacious even when the taste of a forbidden substance might be detected by a professional taster, and <italic>Shakh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 109:8 and <italic>Pri Megadim, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah, Siftei Da&#x2019;at</italic> 102:3, who reject that position.</ftnote>
<ftnote>The most obvious analysis of the controversy between <italic>Torat ha-Bayit</italic> and <italic>Bedek ha-Bayit</italic> is that it centers upon the issue of whether potential separation and removability of a prohibited substance renders it &#x201C;recognizable&#x201D; for purposes of Halakhah. If so, the dispute between <italic>Kereti u-Peleti</italic> and <italic>Pri Megadim</italic> simply mirrors the earlier controversy of <italic>Torat ha-Bayit</italic> and <italic>Bedek ha-Bayit</italic>. See R. Shimon Shkop, <italic>Sha&#x2019;arei Yosher, sha&#x2019;ar gimmel</italic>, chap. 19. Cf., however, R. Chaim Oberlander, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, p. 182.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Rabbi Oberlander cites rulings in other areas of Halakhah that also seem to hinge upon the resolution of this issue. <italic>Teshuvot Yad Eliyahu</italic>, no. 88, discusses the case of a Torah scroll that is unfit for use because it contains an error that becomes mingled with other kosher Torah scrolls and rules that the invalid scroll becomes nullified among the valid scrolls. <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 277, disagrees and asserts that, since by careful examination of the full text of each of the scrolls the invalid scroll may be identified, that scroll does not become nullified. Rabbi Oberlander suggests that the controversy between <italic>Yad Eliyahu</italic> and <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> centers upon precisely this issue, i.e., whether potential identification of a defect, albeit only upon expenditure of significant effort, renders the defect presently &#x201C;recognizable&#x201D; for purposes of Halakhah. He also draws attention to the statement of <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 100:7, to the effect that, were it not a <italic>biryah</italic>, a fertilized egg that could be recognized as such upon meticulous external examination, that becomes intermingled with a large quantity of unfertilized eggs, would become nullified despite the fact that the fertilized egg is potentially identifiable.</ftnote>

Cf., however, <italic>&#x1E92;ema&#x1E25; &#x1E92;edek, Piskei Dinim, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:9, who asserts that, even according to <italic>Shakh</italic>, the food is prohibited only if insects had been found in the fruit prior to cooking. For further discussions of the status of cooked foods that may be insect-infested see <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> 84:131.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn301">56. <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Adam</italic> 38:5 explains <italic>Taz</italic>&#x2019; position on the basis of the fact that the rule that a <italic>biryah</italic> cannot be nullified is the product of a rabbinic edict. Hence, in principle, if there is a question with regard to whether the prohibited organism is still a <italic>biryah</italic> or whether it has lost that status by virtue of having become crushed, the food may be regarded as permissible on the basis of the rule that rabbinic edicts do not extend to situations of doubt. That principle, explains <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Adam</italic>, does not apply in cases of <italic>it&#x1E25;azek issura</italic>, i.e., in situations in which the object was known with certainty to have been forbidden and the sole question is whether its status has changed. Hence, explains <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Adam, Taz</italic> maintains that, so long as there exists even a &#x201C;remote possibility&#x201D; that there never was a forbidden insect in the fruit, the foodstuff was never known to have been forbidden (<italic>it&#x1E25;azek issura</italic>) and hence, despite the fact that the majority of such fruit is infested, the cooked fruit is permitted because of the possibility that any organism that was present may have been crushed. Since it is certain that the insect represents but a tiny fraction of the entire quantity of cooked food, the resultant doubt is only with regard to whether the rabbinic edict canceling nullification in cases of <italic>biryah</italic> is applicable. Since the doubt is with regard to the applicability of a rabbinic prohibition, the food is permissible.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn302">57. Cf., however, Rabbi Gross, <italic>Or Torah</italic>, p. 198, who assumes that this organism loses its status as a <italic>biryah</italic> upon cooking. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 14:6, rules that an insect does not retain the status of a <italic>biryah</italic> if its shape becomes distorted in cooking. It is not clear that that phenomenon is likely to occur with an extremely tiny organism.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn303">58. Rabbi Oberlander, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, Tishri 5765, pp. 111-115, endeavors, <italic>inter alia</italic>, to demonstrate that: 1) under these circumstances the act of <italic>borer</italic> is only rabbinically proscribed; 2) since it is unlikely that copepods are immediately present in the first gush of water released when the faucet is opened, the act of <italic>borer</italic> is in the nature of <italic>gerama</italic>, i.e. opening the faucet is not the proximate cause of any resulting separation; and 3) <italic>gerama</italic> is permitted with regard to rabbinic prohibitions. Of course, each of those points merits careful analysis and substantiation. However, Rabbi Oberlander&#x2019;s discussion is predicated upon a fundamentally flawed presumption. It is quite clear that it is extremely unlikely that copepods will be present in the first gush of water following attachment of a filter. However, if any such creatures are present in the water they will certainly be trapped by the filter when they do appear and will remain in close proximity to the filter at the time of every future use of the filter. Accordingly, if, for example, a filter is installed in an infested building early in the week, opening the faucet some days later on <italic>Shabbat</italic> will result in an immediate act of <italic>borer</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote>In sharp contrast, Rabbi Rosner, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, p. 126, cites the thesis propounded by <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim: Mo&#x2019;ed</italic> 36:1, with regard to culpability for use of a water mill on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> asserts that, with regard to activities proscribed on <italic>Shabbat</italic>, there is no distinction between proximate cause and <italic>gerama</italic> with regard to acts that are customarily performed by way of <italic>gerama</italic>. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish, ibid</italic>., 156: <italic>le-siman</italic> 252, makes the same point with regard to agricultural irrigation, i.e., he regards opening a dam in order to facilitate the flow of water for the purpose of irrigating vegetables to be a biblically culpable act even in the absence of proximate cause and also adopts the same position with regard to setting electrical machines into operation on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. The paradigm upon which the principle is predicated is, according to <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>&#x2019;s analysis, acts of trapping that are forbidden on <italic>Shabbat</italic>, i.e., a trap is set by the hunter but the animal is caught only later by means of its own act of triggering the trap. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> reasons that proximate cause is lacking but that the hunter is nevertheless liable because such is the normal manner of carrying out the act of trapping. Rabbi Rosner applies the same principle to use of a filter: since &#x201C;removing the impediment&#x201D; to the free flow of water through a filter is the usual form of &#x201C;separation&#x201D; of foreign objects from the water, such an act, he contends, constitutes a biblical transgression according to <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn304">59. Cf., however, <italic>Teshuvot Maharam Shik</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 134, who regards such selection as involving a prohibited act of <italic>borer</italic>. Rabbi Joel ha-Levi Rosner, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, p. 118, finds support for that position in the comments of Ramban, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 144b, who remarks that inability to partake of a particular food because of an ancillary Sabbath prohibition does not lead to a problem of <italic>borer</italic>. The implication of that statement is that an intrinsic prohibition attendant upon the foodstuff <italic>qua</italic> foodstuff does give rise to such a problem.</ftnote>

However, <italic>Eglei Tal</italic>, <italic>mel&#x2019;ekhet dash</italic> 17:54, maintains that such separation constitutes a biblical prohibition.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn307">62. See also <italic>Tehilah le-David</italic> 319:25. Rabbi Rosner, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, pp. 121-122, takes sharp issue with <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>&#x2019;s position. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>&#x2019;s ruling is based on the consideration that a beverage may be gently poured from a cup of liquid into which an inedible object has been introduced. Similarly, according to <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, there is no problem of <italic>borer</italic> other than with regard to the last portion of water flowing from the faucet; hence if that water is wasted there is no act of <italic>borer</italic>. In the case of liquid into which an inedible object has fallen, argues Rabbi Rosner, the liquid is spilled in a normal manner and does not &#x201C;appear as separation.&#x201D; However, use of a filter, he contends, clearly represents &#x201C;separation&#x201D; of any and all water in the faucet from the creatures left behind.</ftnote>
<ftnote><italic>Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> also notes that the faucet always remains filled with water when it is turned off and, moreover, there is no separation between that water and the source of the water supply. Therefore, since some water always remains in the system, allowing some water to go to waste would be superfluous. Rabbi Rosner challenges that statement and indeed it would seem that in conventional sinks turning off the faucet impedes the flow of water and leaves the faucet empty. Hence there is &#x201C;separation&#x201D; of the filtered entities from a clearly demarcated body of water.</ftnote>
<ftnote><italic>Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> further notes that <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> permits use on <italic>Shabbat</italic> of a teapot with a built-in strainer. <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> apparently understands <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> as maintaining that, since the strainer remains in place even when straining is not required, i.e., when there are no tea leaves in the teapot, there is no prohibition of <italic>borer</italic> provided that the tea is poured for immediate consumption. See <italic>infra</italic>, note 63. Similarly, argues <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>, since the filter remains in place even when water is drawn for washing, there is no prohibition of <italic>borer</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Rabbi Rosner, however, argues that <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> permits use of such a teapot only because the strainer is an integral and inseparable part of the teapot. A filter, however, is readily removable and hence does not become part of the faucet. See also Rabbi Oberlander, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, Tishri 5765, p. 110. Cf., <italic>Shemirat Shabbat ke-Hilkhatah</italic>, I, 3:57, note 166, who explains <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>&#x2019;s ruling on the basis of R. Shlomoh Zalman Auerbach&#x2019;s view that a utensil that is used only for food that will be consumed immediately is not regarded as a &#x201C;utensil&#x201D; for purposes of separation. Separation other than by means of a utensil for immediate consumption does not constitute a forbidden act of <italic>borer</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote>It should also be noted that <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> advances his opinion with regard to use of the teapot only tentatively (<italic>mihu efshar</italic>). Cf., however, R. Chaim Kanievsky, <italic>Ta&#x2019;ama de-Kra: Hanhagot ha-&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, sec. 40, who reports that <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> permitted use of such a teapot in his household without care being taken to leave some residual liquid in the utensil with the tea leaves. See, however, R. Samuel ha-Levi Woszner, <italic>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, I, no. 84, who refuses to permit use of a teapot with a built-in strainer on <italic>Shabbat</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn308">63. For an analysis of <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>&#x2019;s position see R. Chaim Oberlander, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, Tishri 5765, pp. 107-110.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn309">64. Rabbi Oberlander, <italic>ibid</italic>., p. 110, observes that, according to <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>&#x2019;s understanding of <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, use of a filter is permissible provided that some liquid is left behind and only if the water is obtained immediately prior to its consumption but not if the water is to be consumed only at a later time.</ftnote>
<ftnote>The requirement that the water be used immediately would require that filtration take place at the point at which the water leaves the faucet rather than, for example, at the site of the intake valve since water filtered at a remote site will not necessarily emerge immediately. However, Rabbi Rosner, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, pp. 134-135, finds grounds to permit even such filters. As has been stated earlier, there is no problem with regard to filtration of water to be used for washing since there is no reason to prefer insect-free water for such purposes. Filtration of water that remains in the plumbing system is an effect that is not at all intended by the person presently draining water from the faucet. An act producing an unintentional result is permitted unless the unintended result is a necessary outcome of the otherwise permissible act (<italic>pesik reisha</italic>). Since the next use of water remaining in the system may well be for purposes of washing, and since insect-free water is not required for that purpose, &#x201C;separation&#x201D; of insects from water to be used for such purposes is permitted. Accordingly, there is no certainty that a forbidden form of &#x201C;separation&#x201D; will indeed take place. Since forbidden &#x201C;separation&#x201D; is not a necessary outcome and, if it does result, is unintended, argues Rabbi Rosner, use of such filters on <italic>Shabbat</italic> is permissible.</ftnote>

<ftnote>R.

<ftnote id="fn318">73. Assuming that <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic> is defined as 10&#x0025;, for purposes of establishing a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic> it would be necessary to determine that there is a 10&#x0025; chance that a forbidden creature will be present in the quantity of water drawn on any given occasion.

<ftnote>Moreover, the concept of <italic>rov</italic> and the exclusion of <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic> applies only when the presence of a forbidden entity has not been established with certainty, e.g., an animal or fruit. However, when the presence of a forbidden entity has been established in any particular place with certainty (<italic>kavu&#x2019;a</italic>), but the person is in doubt as to whether the entity he has selected is permitted or forbidden, the principle of <italic>rov</italic> does not apply (<italic>kol kavu&#x2019;a ke-me&#x1E25;e&#x1E93;ah al me&#x1E25;e&#x1E93;ah dami</italic>). It is arguable that since all the water in the faucet and plumbing as well as in the distribution system and the reservoir is contiguous and it is known with certainty that there are at least some copepods in the system, turning on the faucet is tantamount to removing the water from its source and hence the principle of <italic>rov</italic> does not apply.</ftnote>

<h1>I. <italic>The Anisakis Problem and its Precursors</italic></h1>
<p>Fish has always been the food of choice for those concerned with matters of <italic>kashrut</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn320">1</xref></sup> Unlike meat, that not only must be slaughtered, porged, soaked and salted in accordance with the myriad provisions of Halakhah, any fish having fins and scales may be consumed without further ado. Questions concerning the permissibility of fish which have become a staple in the diet of observant Jews are quite unsettling.</p>
<p>A vigorous debate has erupted among rabbinic authorities both in Israel and in the Diaspora regarding the permissibility of consuming fish known to be infested by a parasitic nematode known as Anisakis. Among the suspect species are wild salmon,<sup><xref rid="fn321">2</xref></sup> cod, flounder, Alaskan sole,<sup><xref rid="fn322">3</xref></sup> halibut, pollack, red snapper, perch, Pacific sable, mackerel, blue whiting, herring and sardines imported from Norway and Scotland. The problem is limited to fish harvested in their natural habitats in which, in many cases, the Anisakis also thrives. Farmed fish present no problem since, due to the absence of the marine species in which Anisakis lay their eggs, Anisakis larvae have no opportunity to infest the waters in which farmed fish are raised. Farmed salmon is much less expensive, and hence more common, than wild salmon. The same is true of smoked and cured farmed salmon. However, for a number of reasons, canned salmon is usually of a wild salmon variety and have been found to be infested.<sup><xref rid="fn323">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>By no means is this the first controversy of such nature in modern times. In recent decades there have been a number of contretemps centering upon parasites now commonly found in fish. The first such problem arose in 1978 with regard to the permissibility of sable<sup><xref rid="fn324">5</xref></sup> and a subsequent issue with regard to worms found in other fish, including Canadian whitefish, was debated in the late 1990s.<sup><xref rid="fn325">6</xref></sup> Extensive analyses of the questions posed at those times are presented in various contributions to <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 6 (Tevet 5757), &#x201C;Kuntres ve-Yirdu be-Degat ha-Yam,&#x201D; pp. 137-250.</p>
<p>The facts surrounding the first of that series of controversies concerning parasites found in sable are described in detail by R. Samuel ha-Levi Woszner, <italic>Teshuot Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, IV, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 83. As reported in the name of ichthyologists, the source of those parasites are sailfish. The parasites lay eggs in the sailfish which in turn excrete them into the ocean. The eggs (or probably larvae) are ingested by shrimp in whose intestines the parasites hatch. The shrimp, in turn, are eaten and digested by cod and sable. The parasites survive and infest the flesh of the sable.</p>
<p>In the earlier instances the matter was dismissed by most rabbinic scholars because of lack of empirical evidence that the parasites in question were of a category that is halakhicly forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn326">7</xref></sup> However, with regard to the current controversy concerning the Anisakis worm there is a plethora of evidence, both empirical and scientific, giving substance to the problem.<sup><xref rid="fn327">8</xref></sup> R. Schneur Zalman Revach, head of the Machon le-Mizvot ha-Teluy&#x2019;ot ba-Are&#x1E93;, was apparently the first to bring the Anisakis issue to the attention of rabbinic decisors. Rabbi Revach conducted a thorough investigation of the problem. He personally performed numerous examinations of infested fish and has observed the Anisakis in various stages of development. Detailed information derived from those investigations is presented by Rabbi Revach in his <italic>Tola&#x2019;at Shani</italic> (Bet Uzi&#x2019;el, 5767), II, <italic>Birurei Halakhah,</italic> chap. 5, reprinted in <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 54 (Tevet 5769), pp. 34-41, and in subsequent contributions to that journal. An excellent and widely circulated, but regrettably unpublished, analysis of the problem has been authored by Rabbi Gershon Bess of Los Angeles. Many of the pertinent halakhic issues were earlier discussed by R. Yisra&#x2019;el Dov Halberstam of Antwerp in <italic>Kuntres Ve-Anokhi Tola&#x2019;at</italic>, included as an addendum to his anonymously published <italic>Yad Mikveh</italic> (n.p., 5754).</p>
<p>Fish infested by Anisakis parasites have been banned by virtually all recognized Israeli authorities, including R. Joseph Shalom Eliashiv,<sup><xref rid="fn328">9</xref></sup> R. Nissim Karelitz,<sup><xref rid="fn329">10</xref></sup> R. Samuel ha-Levi Woszner,<sup><xref rid="fn330">11</xref></sup> R. Chaim Kanievsky,<sup><xref rid="fn331">12</xref></sup> R. Moshe Sternbuch,<sup><xref rid="fn332">13</xref></sup> R. Chaim Greineman<sup><xref rid="fn333">14</xref></sup> and R. Shlomoh Amar.<sup><xref rid="fn334">15</xref></sup> The most notable Israeli exception to this consensus is R. Moshe Landau of Bnei Brak.<sup><xref rid="fn335">16</xref></sup> The ruling forbidding such parasites was affirmed in a statement dated 18 Iyar 5771 signed by Rabbis Eliashiv and Woszner as well as by R. Feivel Cohen, R. David Feinstein and R. Aaron Schechter and published in <italic>Hamodia</italic>, 28 Iyar 5771, p. D5 and in <italic>Yated Ne&#x2019;eman</italic>, 5 Sivan 5771, p. 41. A number of American rabbinic personalities, primarily among those identified with the hasidic sector, including R. Yechezkel Roth, formerly a <italic>dayyan</italic> of the Satmar community, have ruled permissively.<sup><xref rid="fn336">17</xref></sup> Numerous articles representing both sides of the controversy were published in <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 54 (Tevet 5769), pp. 18-56; no. 56 (Tammuz 5769), pp. 43-56; no. 57 (Tishri 5770), pp. 148-154; no. 58 (Tevet 5770), 146-152; no. 60 (Tammuz 5770), pp. 32-54; and no. 61 (Tishri 5771), pp. 15-72.</p>
<p>The life cycle of the Anisakis worm is quite remarkable. The cycle begins with mature worms present in marine mammals such as whales or dolphins. The worm deposits its eggs in the mammal. The marine mammal excretes unembryonated eggs which then slowly fall to the ocean floor. The Anisakis worms become embryonated in the water and larvae develop from the eggs. The free-swimming larvae are ingested by crustaceans, most significantly by krill, and mature within their host. The host is then consumed by a predator, e.g., a marine mammal, salmon or flounder, etc., that digests the host but not the Anisakis. The Anisakis then proceeds to encyst itself in the viscera of the host fish. Some of the parasites succeed in piercing through the walls of the visceral organs and migrate into the flesh of the fish.<sup><xref rid="fn337">18</xref></sup> This occurs most frequently after the death of the host fish even though the fish is refrigerated. The parasites die only when the fish is frozen.<sup><xref rid="fn338">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Creatures lacking fins and scales &#x201C;of all that swarms in the waters&#x201D; (Leviticus 11:10) are biblically proscribed. Included in the prohibition against consuming such marine creatures are not only fish and crustaceans but also insects and the like whose natural habitat are &#x201C;the seas and the rivers.&#x201D; Such creatures are forbidden even after having been ingested by a kosher fish but, as explained by the Gemara, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 67b,<sup><xref rid="fn339">20</xref></sup> similar organisms generated within an animal or the flesh of the fish are permitted. Accordingly, as recorded in <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:16, worms found within<sup><xref rid="fn340">21</xref></sup> the entrails<sup><xref rid="fn341">22</xref></sup> of a fish are forbidden because it is to be presumed<sup><xref rid="fn342">23</xref></sup> that they were earlier present in the water and were ingested by the fish, whereas such creatures, when found between the skin and flesh, or, according to most authorities,<sup><xref rid="fn343">24</xref></sup> within the flesh of the fish itself,<sup><xref rid="fn344">25</xref></sup> are permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn345">26</xref></sup> Even if they develop within the fish while the fish is still alive, such creatures are regarded as having originated in the fish itself.<sup><xref rid="fn346">27</xref></sup> As enunciated by the Gemara, the applicable principle is that creatures that grow from the flesh of a kosher fish or of an animal that has been slaughtered<sup><xref rid="fn347">28</xref></sup> are entirely permissible.</p>
<p>Despite the relative clarity&#x2014;in application, if not in theory&#x2013;-of the principles governing the status of insects found in fish, a number of controversies arose in previous generations. Insects found on the surface of a fish are, quite understandably, presumed to have flourished in water rather than in the fish itself and hence are forbidden. R. Abraham Danzig, <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Adam</italic> 38:28, reports that, beginning in the spring and until the onset of winter, he &#x201C;many times&#x201D; observed the presence of worms in the mouths and ears of various species of fish, particularly hecht. During that season, rules <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Adam</italic>, fish must be examined for the presence of such worms. <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Adam</italic> further reports that, although they were not to be found in his own city of Vilna, in many locales, &#x201C;fish lice&#x201D; were also found to be present in the proximity of the fins and in the mouths of fish. The fish lice are described as &#x201C;round as barley&#x201D; with tiny black eyes placed close together. In Prague &#x201C;everyone recognized them&#x201D; and a well-known ban existed against consuming those fish without vigorous scraping in the area of the fins and the tail and examination behind the ears and mouth.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, R. Meir Arak, <italic>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</italic>, II, no. 11, reports that, at least in some areas, many people ate carp regularly without performing such an examination despite the known presence of the lice described by <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Adam</italic>. In defending that practice, <italic>Imrei Yosher</italic> entertains the possibility that only worms found on the surface of the fish must be presumed to originate in the water that is the fish&#x2019;s habitat but that perhaps those found &#x201C;under the scales&#x201D; are more likely to be generated within the fish itself. <italic>Imrei Yosher</italic> concludes that there are grounds to permit eating such fish without examination but only if scientists will testify that the source of the worm is the flesh of the fish. Not surprisingly, there is no indication that such substantiation was forthcoming. R. Israel Jacob Klapholz, <italic>Admorei Belz</italic>, IV (Bnei Brak, 5736),118, reports that R. Aaron Rokeach refused to accept a lenient ruling reported in the name of R. Shalom Mordecai Schwadron (Maharsham) with regard to this matter and also rejected the expedient of removing the scales of the fish to examine for the presence of parasites. Moreover, when told that a respected personality, R. Saul Brock, had issued a permissive ruling, he responded to his informant by saying, &#x201C;I appoint you my agent to ask him to retract his ruling.&#x201D;</p>
<h1>II. <italic>The Anisakis in Light of Rambam&#x2019;s Stringent Ruling</italic></h1>
<p>Contradicting the majority of early-day authorities, Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;akhalot Assurot</italic> 2:17, rules that only worms generated in the rotting flesh of dead fish are permitted but those generated while the fish are still alive, even if the worms are found embedded in the flesh, are forbidden. As explained by <italic>Maggid Mishneh, ad locum</italic>, such worms are forbidden as a matter of doubt because of the possibility that they may have been ingested together with water and swallowed by the fish and later migrated into the flesh, whereas it is the nature of decaying tissue to generate worms.<sup><xref rid="fn348">29</xref></sup> <italic>Maggid Mishneh</italic> explains that the word &#x201C;<italic>darni</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn349">30</xref></sup> employed by the Gemara to denote permitted worms specifically refers to creatures generated in decaying flesh.<sup><xref rid="fn350">31</xref></sup> According to Rambam, only creatures found in the decaying flesh of a dead organism are presumed to have been generated by that organism.<sup><xref rid="fn351">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>As understood by <italic>Maggid Mishneh</italic>, the controversy between Rambam and opposing authorities is limited in nature and involves no dispute with regard to any fundamental halakhic or scientific principle. All agree that organisms generated outside the animal or fish are forbidden and all accept both the principle of spontaneous generation or its equivalent and the principle that, when known to have been generated within an animal or fish, such organisms are permitted. The sole dispute is with regard to the presumption attendant upon organisms found embedded in the flesh of the animal or fish. Rambam maintains that the origin of such organisms is a matter of doubt and hence they are forbidden unless found in flesh that has begun to rot since only in that case may they be presumed to have been generated by the decaying flesh. Rambam&#x2019;s opponents rule that, when found in the flesh of the creature rather than in the creature&#x2019;s internal organs, it may be assumed that the organisms were generated within the flesh of the creature and hence are permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn352">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Ephraim Zalman Margulies, <italic>Teshuvot Bet Efrayim, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 25, asserts that numerous early-day authorities, including <italic>Sefer ha-Terumot</italic>, no. 36; <italic>Sefer Mi&#x1E93;vot Gadol, lo ta&#x2019;aseh</italic>, no. 132; <italic>Sha&#x2019;arei Dura</italic>, no. 54; and <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>, concur in Rambam&#x2019;s opinion, and, for that reason, <italic>Bet Efrayim</italic> strongly leans toward ruling in accordance with Rambam&#x2019;s stringent view. Although <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> accepts the permissive view of the many early-day authorities who disagree with Rambam, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> concludes his codification of that ruling by declaring, &#x201C;There are those who forbid worms that are generated after slaughter.&#x201D; <italic>Be&#x2019;er ha-Golah</italic> and <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an, ad locum</italic>, identify the anonymous authority cited by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> as Rambam. R. Moshe Mordechai Karp, in a brief monograph titled <italic>Le-Afrushei me-Issura</italic>: <italic>Be-Inyan Kashrut ha-Dagim</italic> (5770), cites <italic>Shakh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 243: <italic>ki&#x1E93;ur klalei issur ve-hetter</italic>, sec. 5, and <italic>Kaf ha-&#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 243:164 who declare that whenever an authority is cited in that manner by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, even though the normative rule is permissive, nevertheless, &#x201C;a pious person should be stringent for himself.&#x201D; According to that view, all fish infested with parasites should be abjured even in the absence of positive evidence that the parasites are commonly imbibed by the fish from the water in which it swims. Thus, concludes Rabbi Karp, &#x201C;a pious person&#x201D; should abstain from eating Anisakis-infested fish regardless of how the controversy is resolved.</p>
<h1>III. <italic>Anisakis and the Talmudic Presumption of Permissibility</italic></h1>
<p>The authorities who are unconcerned with regard to possible Anisakis infestation of commonly consumed fish do not accept Rambam&#x2019;s position. For the most part, they regard the principle formulated by the Gemara regarding spontaneous generation of insects in the flesh of fish as empirically correct, universal in nature and an irrebuttable presumption not subject to scientific challenge. They regard any challenge to that position as either bordering upon, or as actual, heresy. The many scholars who regard the problem in a serious light either maintain that the Gemara refers to a specifically named organism or do not regard the statement of the Gemara as universally applicable to all organisms and hence distinguish the Anisakis on either halakhic or empirical grounds. Some authorities declare that the principle of &#x201C;<italic>nishtaneh ha-teva</italic>&#x2014;nature has changed&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn353">34</xref></sup> is applicable and assert that, although spontaneous generation occurred in ancient times, it is no longer a reality or, alternatively, state simply that, although parasites such as Anisakis were rare in earlier ages, they have become much more common in our era.<sup><xref rid="fn354">35</xref></sup> Indeed, <italic>Shakh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:22, states that frequency of infestation varies from place to place and from era to era.<sup><xref rid="fn355">36</xref></sup> Rabbi Halberstam, addenda to <italic>Ve-Anokhi Tola&#x2019;at</italic>, p. 39, attributes increased infestation in our day to present use of refrigeration enabling fish to be shipped long distances without being eviscerated.<sup><xref rid="fn356">37</xref></sup> As noted earlier, migration of Anisakis from the intestine takes place after the death of the host.<sup><xref rid="fn357">38</xref></sup> Some scientists attribute proliferation of parasites to the warming of sea waters.<sup><xref rid="fn358">39</xref></sup> Accordingly, it is not surprising that changed empirical reality results in halakhic rulings differing from those applicable in circumstances that prevailed in earlier times.<sup><xref rid="fn359">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Karp, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic> no. 58, p. 147, and R. Moshe Eliezer Bloom, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 54, p. 20, cite numerous authorities, including Rabbenu Nissim, Rashba, Ran, Re&#x2019;ah, Me&#x2019;iri and <italic>Hagahot Asheri</italic>, who employ language indicating that the worms permitted by the Gemara are sanctioned only because, in the assumed circumstances, it is impossible that they might have spawned in water and subsequently have been swallowed by the fish. The Gemara declares that, were that the case, worms of the same species would also be found in the excretory organs. Thus, for example, Ran, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin 66b,</italic> writes<italic>,</italic> &#x201C;Worms found in meat that could not possibly come from outside, but are generated from the meat, are permitted.&#x201D; Re&#x2019;ah, <italic>loc. cit.</italic>, similarly states that, &#x201C;Worms found in meat in a place in which it is not possible<sup><xref rid="fn360">41</xref></sup> that they came from outside&#x201D; are permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn361">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>In their discussions, both Rabbi Karp and Rabbi Bloom (<italic>ibid</italic>., pp. 22-23) assert that parasites found in the flesh are permitted only because there is no evidence, and no reason to assume, that they migrated from the digestive tract. However, they cogently contend, when there are grounds to suspect otherwise, such organisms are prohibited. That view was previously formulated by R. Shlomoh Zalman Ehrenreich, <italic>Teshuvot Le&#x1E25;em Shlomoh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 71, and by Rabbi Halberstam, <italic>Ve-Anokhi Tola&#x2019;at</italic>, p. 7. Rabbi Karp notes that <italic>Ba&#x1E25;, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84; <italic>Knesset ha-Gedolah, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:101; and R. Shlomoh Luria, both in his glosses to <italic>Sha&#x2019;arei Dura</italic> 47:3 and in <italic>Yam shel Shlomoh, &#x1E24;ullin</italic> 3:106, declare that only worms found in a previously uncut and uneviscerated fish are permitted because it is virtually impossible that the worms could have come from the water and penetrated that deeply into the fish whereas the provenance of worms found in an already opened or cut fish is indeterminable and hence such worms are forbidden. R. Samuel ha-Levi Woszner, <italic>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, IV, no. 83 and VII, no. 127, sec. 3, and R. Nathan Gestetner, <italic>Teshuvot Le-Horot Natan</italic>, IX, no. 25, similarly maintain that piscatorial organisms are permissible only when it can be determined with certainty that they were not ingested by the fish.<sup><xref rid="fn362">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>The identical argument is also advanced by R. Moshe Saul Klein, an associate of Rabbi Woszner, in a contribution to the symposium published in <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 61, pp. 33-35. Rabbi Klein distinguishes the Anisakis from the worms permitted by the Sages. The permitted worms, he asserts, were sanctioned only because they are &#x201C;certainly&#x201D; generated within the flesh of the fish itself. Citing <italic>Teshuvot Bet Efrayim, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 25, Rabbi Klein argues that such a conclusion is warranted only if evidenced by the absence of a perforation between the skeletal flesh and the internal portion of the fish through which a worm generated externally and swallowed by the fish might have migrated. According to <italic>Bet Efrayim</italic>, absence of such a perforation is required to confirm that the worm could not have bored its way through the intestinal wall. However, when Anisakis is found in the flesh, argues Rabbi Klein, absence of such a perforation is meaningless because that nematode is so tiny that any hole it created would not be of sufficient size to be perceived. As will be noted subsequently, actual presence of such holes is additional evidence of the worm&#x2019;s origin in the digestive tract.</p>
<h1>IV. <italic>Parasites Found Both in the Flesh and in the Digestive Tract</italic></h1>
<p>Rabbi Karp makes one additional point. The Gemara speaks only of worms found in the digestive tract or in the flesh. However, all early-day authorities discuss the status of worms found either in the digestive tract, in the flesh or between the flesh and the skin. They do not directly address the situation in which the same species of worm or insect is found both in the digestive tract and in the flesh. The latter is virtually always the case with regard to Anisakis. As clearly expressed in numerous sources, worms found in the flesh are permitted because there is no reason to suspect that the worms originated outside the fish. Worms found in the digestive tract are always deemed to have come from outside the fish and to have been ingested by the fish. According to Rabbi Karp, if forbidden worms are indeed found in the digestive tract and other worms of the same species are also found in the flesh, there is certainly at least as much reason to assume that they penetrated the viscera and entered the flesh as there is to assume that they were generated within the flesh of the fish.<sup><xref rid="fn363">44</xref></sup> <italic>Teshuvot Le-Horot Natan,</italic> IX, no. 24, sec. 12 and no. 25, reaches a similar conclusion.<sup><xref rid="fn364">45</xref></sup> That is certainly the case in situations in which the worms are found in tissue immediately adjacent to the internal organs. Such a conclusion is even more compelling when, as is the case with regard to Anisakis, tiny holes in the intestinal wall can be observed upon examination.<sup><xref rid="fn365">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>In advancing an opposing position, R. Moshe Roth, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 57, pp. 151-153, contends that it is no more likely that worms penetrate from the digestive tract into the flesh than vice versa. Rabbi Roth asserts that the Sages assumed that such creatures, at least in a mature state, are not capable of piercing the walls of an organ in migrating from one site to another.<sup><xref rid="fn366">47</xref></sup> Consequently, even if mature organisms are present in the viscera, any parasites found in the flesh of the fish, even if they are of the same species as those found in the viscera, must have developed within the flesh and hence, he declares, such creatures are permissible.<sup><xref rid="fn367">48</xref></sup> The authorities who rule permissively fail to address the status of an Anisakis found partially within the intestine and partially within the flesh.<sup><xref rid="fn368">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recognition of the ability of parasites to pierce the walls of the digestive tract is reflected in the fact that numerous authorities prohibit worms that are found between the digestive tract and surrounding muscle or skeletal tissue.<sup><xref rid="fn369">50</xref></sup> Among those are <italic>Teshuvot Bet Efrayim, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 25, who forbids organisms found on the external surface of visceral organs; R. Yehudah Ayash, <italic>Le&#x1E25;em Yehudah, Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;akhalot Assurot</italic> 2:17, R. Chaim Pelaggi, <italic>Mo&#x2019;ed le-Khol &#x1E24;ai</italic> 12:20 and <italic>Teshuvot Matteh Re&#x2019;uven</italic>, no. 167, who declare that the entire abdominal cavity is included in the category of viscera; and R. Shlomoh Ganzfried, <italic>Ki&#x1E93;ur Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> 46:43, who prohibits worms found on the internal fatty tissue of herring.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, the controversy actually hinges upon a contingency not addressed by the Gemara. The Gemara speaks of worms found within the digestive tract and other internal organs and of worms found in the flesh. The Gemara does not address the case of worms found simultaneously in the flesh and in internal organs. Assuming that organisms can penetrate the intestinal wall, their presence in the digestive tract compromises the presumption that identical organisms found in the flesh of the fish could not have been spawned outside the fish. Thus, as has been discussed earlier, the many authorities who refuse to sanction consumption of Anisakis-infested fish arrive at that position because they assume, as a matter of course, that all organisms present simultaneously in the viscera and the flesh are forbidden. Their opponents begin with a conflicting premise: they assume that organisms found in the flesh are permitted even when similar organisms are also present in the internal organs.</p>
<p>The assumption that organisms found in the flesh are always permitted and the antecedent premise that parasites cannot migrate from the viscera to the flesh are based upon a textual inference. Writing in 1957, R. Yechezkel Roth, <italic>Emek ha-Teshuvah</italic>, IV, no. 57, dismissed the possibility that parasites may penetrate the flesh of a fish on the basis of the blanket talmudic ruling declaring that all insects found in the flesh are permitted. In the immediately following responsum, no. 58, his son, R. Yitzchak Roth, presents a wide-ranging discussion of when such global talmudic statements may be regarded simply as generalizations admitting of at least rare exceptions and when they must be understood literally. Rabbi Roth asserts that there can be no universal statement of such nature that admits of an exception if erroneous application of the generalization would lead to transgression. Consequently, he concludes, the generalization could have been enunciated only if it is to be applied literally without exception.</p>
<p>That argument is misplaced for the simple reason that the alleged universal proposition is not talmudic in origin but is first formulated by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:16. Moreover, as pointed out by R. Moshe Eliezer Bloom, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 56, p. 47, the citation of <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>&#x2019;s statement is misconstrued.<sup><xref rid="fn370">51</xref></sup> <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> rules, &#x201C;All worms found in an animal, whether between the hide and the flesh or in its viscera, are forbidden. Those found in fish: in the viscera, they are forbidden; between the skin and the flesh or in the flesh, they are permitted.&#x201D; <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>&#x2019;s global statement is made only with regard to animals. The word &#x201C;<italic>kol</italic>,&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;all,&#x201D; is noticeably absent in the portion of the ruling dealing with fish. It is certainly possible that the same generalization was intended; it is equally possible that it was not. The phraseology is simply ambiguous.</p>
<p><italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> explains the terminology employed by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> in a somewhat different manner. <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> perceives no contradiction whatsoever between scientific findings and the discussion of the Gemara, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 67b. He cites Me&#x2019;iri in asserting that &#x201C;<italic>darna</italic>&#x201D; permitted by the Gemara is the name of a particular species known to the Sages.<sup><xref rid="fn371">52</xref></sup> Since only that species is capable of generating worms in its flesh while yet alive, and since we cannot identify the <italic>darna</italic>, we must regard all fish infested by parasites as forbidden. Consequently, asserts <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, there is no controversy between Rambam and other early-day authorities, nor does Rambam contradict the Gemara in any way. Rambam, he explains, rules that worms found in a living fish are forbidden simply because we cannot identify the <italic>darna</italic>. Rambam does permit worms found in a dead fish but is careful to describe them as permissible when they &#x201C;sprout before us&#x201D; (<italic>hitli&#x2019;ah le-faneinu</italic>) because only under those circumstances can worms be assumed to be generated by decaying tissue.</p>
<p><italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> fully conceded that <italic>Tur</italic> and <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, in positing a general rule with regard to all marine species, disagree with regard to this point. Those authorities maintain that the rule is not limited to a specific species but is general in nature. However, <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> asserts that the controversy is only with regard to the assumption that pertains in the generality of cases &#x201C;but all agree that the opposite also exists,&#x201D; <italic>viz</italic>., species whose flesh certainly does not generate parasites and, consequently, any parasite found in such fish must have originated elsewhere. In his original discussion in 5751, <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> ruled that, if the scientific evidence is corroborated, infested sable may not be consumed.</p>
<p>It seems to this writer that the assertion that parasites are capable of migrating from the internal organs to the flesh of the fish is supported by the discussion recorded by the Gemara, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 67b. The Gemara begins its discussion by citing a dictum of Rav Shisha the son of Rav Idi to the effect that &#x201C;<italic>kuki&#x2019;ani</italic>&#x201D; are forbidden because they originate outside the organism in which they are found. Rav Ashi rejects that view because, if that were the case, similar creatures should be found in the excretory organs as well. The Gemara later concludes that such creatures are forbidden because they might have entered through the nostrils while the animal was asleep. Hence, as both Rashi and <italic>Tosafot</italic> indicate, they are forbidden even if found in the liver or in the lungs and their absence in the excretory organs is of no significance. However, the Gemara, at the initial stage of its discussion, had no problem accepting the proposition that worms are forbidden&#x2014;apparently at whatever site they may be found&#x2014;provided they are also present in the viscera; an explanation of how such creatures found their way into the fish from outside the animal becomes necessary only if they are not also present in the excretory organs. That premise is not at all rejected. In a second version of that exchange recorded by the Gemara, Rav Shisha the son of Rav Idi declared &#x201C;<italic>kuki&#x2019;ani&#x201D;</italic> to be permissible because they are generated by their host. To that assertion, Rav Ashi responded by saying, &#x201C;Obviously, for, if they came from outside, they should be found in the excretory organs.&#x201D; Again, the clear inference is that, if the same species of insect is indeed found in the digestive system in addition to being found in the flesh, the creatures found in the flesh are also forbidden because of the strong possibility that they migrated to the flesh from the viscera.</p>
<p>It is at least theoretically possible to construct a crucial experiment having the potential to demonstrate that the hypothesis Rabbi Roth, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 57, p. 151, ascribes to the Sages, <italic>viz</italic>., that parasites cannot migrate from the viscera to the flesh, is fallacious. A quantity of farm-grown fish might be introduced into a tank of parasite-free water. It is probably possible to modify parasites genetically so that they acquire a distinctive color as has been done with various species of fish. Those genetically modified parasites would then be introduced into the tank. If, upon harvesting the fish, only such genetically modified parasites are found in the flesh of the fish, it would defy credulity to believe that those parasites arose from the flesh rather than from the water.<sup><xref rid="fn372">53</xref></sup> Less dramatic, but far simpler and only slightly less convincing, would be an experiment requiring no more than a DNA analysis of the parasites introduced into the tank containing the fish and a subsequent DNA analysis of the parasites later found in the flesh of those fish. DNA evidence would serve to establish whether the parasites found in the flesh are genetically descended from the parasites originally placed in the water or whether they are indeed unrelated to those parasites.</p>
<h1>V. <italic>Subvisual Organisms</italic></h1>
<p>As will subsequently be explained, subvisual organisms, i.e., creatures that cannot be perceived by the naked eye, are not prohibited.<sup><xref rid="fn373">54</xref></sup> It may be argued that parasites that enter the intestinal tract of the fish when they have not yet reached a state of development at which they are visible should be permitted even if they migrate to the flesh of the fish while yet in that early stage of development and grow in size. R. Pesach Eliyahu Falk, <italic>Madrikh le-Bedikat Tola&#x2019;im: Guide to the Inspection of Fruits and Vegetables for Insects</italic> (Gateshead, 5744), p. 92, contends that, if no cognizance is taken of them in a subvisual state, their juridical identity is established at the time at which they do become perceivable. If so, their development within the fish should, arguably, give them the status of worms generated by the fish itself.<sup><xref rid="fn374">55</xref></sup> Accordingly, parasites known to have spawned outside of the fish are permitted when found in the flesh of the fish because they acquire the halakhic identity of the host fish at the time at which they become visible.<sup><xref rid="fn375">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is not at all clear that this is so if the parasites develop in the intestinal tract before migrating to other parts of the fish. Worms found in the flesh are permitted because, since they feed upon the flesh, they are deemed to have been produced by the fish itself. Worms or parasites that develop in the intestinal tract presumably are nourished, not by the flesh of the fish, but by nutrients ingested by the fish and hence should have the same prohibited status as worms that originate outside the body of the fish.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, R. Nathan Gestetner, <italic>Le-Horot Natan</italic>, IX, no. 25, sec. 14, disputes the basic contention that the status of the parasite is determined by its location at the time it becomes visible. <italic>Le-Horot Natan</italic> asserts that, even if the parasite is subvisual at the time it migrates to the flesh of the fish, upon becoming visual it acquires the status of a prohibited creature. <italic>Le-Horot Natan</italic> argues that the reason certain worms are permitted is because, as stated by the Gemara, they are produced by the flesh of the fish. In effect, the worm and the fish are considered to be a single entity. Accordingly, although microscopic larvae are themselves not forbidden, the development of parasites from such larvae cannot be attributed to the flesh of the fish and it is only a worm whose genesis can be ascribed to the fish that may be deemed to have the status of the host. Hence, the genesis of the parasite must be ascribed to its actual progenitor even if in the earliest stage of its development it is infinitesimally small and hence not halakhically cognized.</p>
<p>In support of that thesis, <italic>Le-Horot Natan</italic> cites <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 14:1, secs. 10 and 12, with regard to a parallel rule regarding the permissibility of creatures that spawn in &#x201C;vessels.&#x201D; <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> comments that the rule applies &#x201C;only when the hylic power of the water generates them.&#x201D; However, if an adult creature excreted eggs in the utensil, the organism that develops from such eggs is forbidden. That is so despite the fact that such individual eggs deposited in the utensil are certainly not visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>A similar argument is advanced by Rabbi Klein, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 61, p. 35. Rabbi Klein asserts that the principle with regard to subvisual creatures is simply an expression of the principle &#x201C;The Torah was not given to ministering angels&#x201D; (<italic>Berakhot</italic> 28b) and means only that such an organism cannot be prohibited if it cannot be perceived, but does not imply that such existence is to be ignored. Accordingly, if such creatures are known to have &#x201C;swarmed,&#x201D; even if such swarming took place while they were as yet not perceivable, those organisms are prohibited when they do become visible. Rabbi Klein reports that both R. Joseph Shalom Eliashiv and R. Samuel Woszner concur in that conclusion.</p>
<p>As evidence in support of that position, Rabbi Klein cites R. Jonathan Eibeschutz, <italic>Kereti u-Peleti, Peleti, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:5. <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:6, rules that a worm found in a fruit that has not been plucked, and hence is still attached to the ground, is forbidden provided that the worm has &#x201C;crept&#x201D; within the fruit. Since the fruit is still attached to the ground, the worm is regarded as having &#x201C;swarmed&#x201D; on the ground. Nevertheless, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, loc. cit</italic>., rules that similar worms found under the skin of &#x201C;beans and peas&#x201D; are permitted because, due to the confining nature of the space in which they thrive, there is no room for them to &#x201C;swarm.&#x201D;</p>
<p><italic>Kereti u-Peleti</italic> explains that when such a worm comes into existence it is so infinitesimally small that &#x201C;no eye can perceive it.&#x201D; At that early stage of its development the worm is capable of at least minimal movement within the host fruit. Hence, according to <italic>Kereti u-Peleti</italic>, locomotion by a &#x201C;swarming creature&#x201D; while it is yet subvisual renders the organism a prohibited creature when it does mature and becomes visible.<sup><xref rid="fn376">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>At issue is the nature of the principle that subclinical phenomena are to be disregarded. The concept can be understood in two distinct ways: 1) The Torah simply ignores any and all subclinical entities and phenomena and regards them as non-existent. That notion mirrors the reasoning of Resh Lakish, <italic>Yoma</italic> 73b, who maintains that a quantity of forbidden food less than the minimum for which statutory punishment is prescribed, is entirely permissible according to biblical law because, in effect, the Torah completely disregards its existence.<sup><xref rid="fn377">58</xref></sup> 2) The phenomena are indeed recognized as real but, since the Torah was given to human beings rather than to angels, no mandate or stricture can be attendant upon such entities or phenomena<sup><xref rid="fn378">59</xref></sup> unless and until there is perceivable evidence of such entity or occurrence.<sup><xref rid="fn379">60</xref></sup> If all subvisual events are to be entirely ignored, the &#x201C;creeping&#x201D; of minuscule Anisakis is of no moment. If, however, subclinical phenomena are ignored only until there is clinical evidence of their occurrence, the &#x201C;creeping&#x201D; of the Anisakis, while yet microscopic, renders it a &#x201C;swarming creature&#x201D; at least at such time as it becomes visually perceivable.<sup><xref rid="fn380">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>An ostensively even stronger argument is formulated by Rabbi Halberstam, <italic>Ve-Anokhi Tola&#x2019;at</italic>, p. 11, and by R. Ephraim Fishel Siegal, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 61, pp. 71-72. They contend that, even if minuscule creatures are not halakhically cognized, and, as Rabbi Falk argues, the species identity of such creatures is established at the time it becomes discernible to the naked eye, the Anisakis should nevertheless be forbidden. An Anisakis that reaches such a stage of development within crustaceans should be regarded either as a <italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic> of a forbidden fish<sup><xref rid="fn381">62</xref></sup> or as having acquired the identity of the species of fish of which its host is a member.<sup><xref rid="fn382">63</xref></sup> Consistent with that assessment, <italic>Min&#x1E25;at &#x1E24;innukh</italic>, no. 163, declares that, although worms that develop in the flesh of a dead animal are not prohibited as the <italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic> of a limb of a living animal, nevertheless, if the animal is a member of a non-kosher species, such worms are forbidden by virtue of the prohibition against eating the flesh of a non-kosher animal.<sup><xref rid="fn383">64</xref></sup> That ruling is recorded by <italic>Darkei Teshuvah</italic> 84:177.<sup><xref rid="fn384">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, as stated earlier, worms that develop within flesh of the fish are regarded as the product of the fish because they are generated by, and feed upon, the flesh in which they are embedded. Parasites developing in the digestive tract of a non-kosher fish might be regarded as the product of partially digested food found within those organs, but not of the non-kosher fish or crustacean.</p>
<p>Moreover, and most significantly, it does not appear to be the case that the Anisakis are imbibed by krill only as subvisual larvae. The larvae are reported to be no smaller than 200 microns long and 14 microns wide.<sup><xref rid="fn385">66</xref></sup> R. Moshe Viya, <italic>Bedikat Mazon ke-Halakhah,</italic> I, <italic>sha&#x2019;ar sheni</italic>, chap. 2, note 6, reports that researchers in ophthalmology have established that an object five microns long and one-half micron wide can be seen at a distance of twenty-five centimeters by a person with normal vision.<sup><xref rid="fn386">67</xref></sup> If krill ingest already perceivable Anisakis,<sup><xref rid="fn387">68</xref></sup> the argument for declaring such parasites permissible is entirely undermined.</p>
<h1>VI. <italic>Scientific Evidence</italic></h1>
<p>The reasoning advanced by the Gemara, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 67b, in permitting worms found between the skin and the flesh, <italic>viz</italic>., &#x201C;they are generated from it,&#x201D; certainly appears to reflect reliance upon a notion of spontaneous generation. Whether that statement is to be understood literally and, if so, whether rejection of that concept by modern science has any bearing upon Halakhah, or whether the Gemara&#x2019;s statement should be understood as expressing a concept that is compatible with contemporary scientific theory are intriguing questions.<sup><xref rid="fn388">69</xref></sup> Resolution of those questions is, however, irrelevant to the points that have been made herein.<sup><xref rid="fn389">70</xref></sup> Those points are entirely compatible with even the most literal reading of the text and do not at all entail the slightest negation of any empirical presumption made by the Sages. Moreover, if the notion of spontaneous generation is rejected and the various theories advanced to reconcile the apparently contradictory talmudic statements with contemporary science are rejected, the resulting conclusion that, contra unequivocal dicta and precedents spanning more than two millennia, all worms and piscatorial parasites found in the flesh of fish are forbidden is compelled. To date, no rabbinic scholar has espoused such a conclusion with regard to piscatorial parasites.<sup><xref rid="fn390">71</xref></sup> To be sure, some protagonists in the modern-day controversies have been accused of harboring such predilections and certainly of rejecting talmudic teachings in favor of fidelity to science.<sup><xref rid="fn391">72</xref></sup> Those charges have been vigorously and vehemently denied. A fair reading of the published material exposes such charges as spurious. The authorities who prohibit consumption of fish infested with Anisakis assert simply that the Sages never claimed that all &#x201C;creeping things&#x201D; found in the flesh of animals or fish are spontaneously generated. Hence, in situations in which there is evidence to the contrary, such organisms must be regarded as forbidden.</p>
<p>Rabbi Revach strongly insists that his conclusions are in no way predicated upon reports of scientists who reject the possibility of spontaneous generation<sup><xref rid="fn392">73</xref></sup> but are based upon his own observations of the Anisakis at various stages of development, many of which he has recorded photographically. Similarly, Rabbi Halberstam, <italic>Ve-Anokhi Tola&#x2019;at</italic>, pp. 5-7, emphasizes that the available scientific information regarding Anisakis is not based upon denial of the possibility of spontaneous generation on the part of scientists but upon empirical observation. Unlike those of many parasites, the eggs of Anisakis do not survive within a predator; Anisakis survive within the body of their host only if imbibed as larvae. Hence it is not necessary to deny the phenomenon of spontaneous generation of other aquatic organisms while negating such a possibility with regard to Anisakis.</p>
<p>More significantly, Anisakis have never been observed in the flesh of a fish other than when Anisakis have also been found to be present in its digestive system. Since the Anisakis found in the digestive tract certainly originate outside of the fish, it is logical to conclude that creatures of the same species found in the flesh of the fish share a common origin and were also spawned outside the fish. Photographs have been taken showing individual Anisakis partially within the intestine and partially within the flesh of the host. That phenomenon establishes that, at least after the death of its host, the Anisakis is capable of migrating from the digestive tract into the flesh of the fish. Since that is a distinct possibility, even were Anisakis to be found solely in the flesh, it cannot be claimed with certainty that those organisms did not also migrate from the digestive tract.</p>
<p>Rabbi Roth, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 57, p. 151, counters that, on the basis of the statements of the Gemara, one must conclude that Anisakis never migrate from viscera to flesh and, accordingly, those found within internal organs are forbidden, whereas those found in the flesh of the same fish are permitted because they must have been generated by the flesh itself.</p>
<p>As recorded in <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, IV, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 83, Rabbi Woszner&#x2019;s interlocutor, R. Shmu&#x2019;el Shmelka Friedman, <italic>dayyan</italic> of the Pupa community and one of the halakhic authorities of the Central Congress of American Rabbis (Hitachdut ha-Rabbanim), advanced an interesting argument designed to render the scientific evidence moot. Rabbi Friedman assumed that larvae do not emerge from the eggs of the parasite until they are swallowed by shrimp. Since shrimp are swallowed whole by sable, the parasites never become organisms that &#x201C;creep in the waters;&#x201D; rather, their life cycle unfolds wholly within marine organisms.</p>
<p><italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> regards that argument as unfounded. The same basic principles apply with regard to insect-infested fruit, i.e., an insect that develops wholly within a fruit is permissible but becomes forbidden when it emerges and &#x201C;creeps upon the earth.&#x201D; The Gemara questions the permissibility of an insect that bores its way &#x201C;from one date to another date,&#x201D; i.e., out of one plucked fruit and into another immediately touching fruit. In effect, the question is whether the insect is forbidden only if, at the minimum it becomes exposed to the atmosphere or whether it lacks the status of a creature that &#x201C;creeps upon the earth&#x201D; as long as it remains inside a fruit even if that particular fruit is not the organism&#x2019;s progenitor. The situation with regard to the parasite found in sable is the same: the parasite travels from one fish, <italic>viz</italic>., the shrimp, to another, <italic>viz</italic>., the sable, without exiting the body of a marine species.<sup><xref rid="fn393">74</xref></sup> The question with regard to infested fruit is left unresolved by the Gemara. Since the status of such creatures remains doubtful, they are forbidden. The same principle, concludes <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, applies to marine parasites as well.<sup><xref rid="fn394">75</xref></sup> Moreover, argues <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, the Gemara expresses doubt only with regard to a creature that passes (<italic>piresh</italic>) &#x201C;from one date to another date&#x201D; in which the host fruits share a common identity as members of a particular species. There is no indication of a similar doubt in a situation in which an already recognizable creature passes from one species to another,<sup><xref rid="fn395">76</xref></sup> e.g., from a date to a fig or from a shrimp to a sable.<sup><xref rid="fn396">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, since the eggs hatch in the water to release free-swimming larvae,<sup><xref rid="fn397">78</xref></sup> the larvae consumed by the shrimp acquire the status of organisms that &#x201C;swarm in the water&#x201D; before being ingested by the shrimp. This factual consideration renders the exchange between Rabbi Friedman and <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> entirely moot.</p>
<p>Rabbi Friedman further argued that, although the fertilized egg of a land creature is forbidden, the fertilized egg of an aquatic creature is not forbidden until the hatchling is exposed to the natural elements. <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> counters that such considerations are germane only with regard to the status of the fertilized egg itself but that once larvae emerge from the egg their status is that of the species of which they are members.</p>
<h1>VII. <italic>Eggs of Parasites</italic></h1>
<p>By far the most engaging&#x2014;and most novel&#x2014;argument in support of ignoring the newly-presented realia regarding the life cycle of the problematic Anisakis parasites is formulated by R. Moshe Landau, Chief Rabbi of Bnei Brak, in a contribution to the Elul 5770 issue of the Israeli Torah journal <italic>Pa&#x2019;amei Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>. Insofar as factual issues are concerned, Rabbi Landau dismisses the contention that delay in processing the fish experienced in contemporary circumstances allows the ingested larvae to mature, to migrate from the stomach and to penetrate the flesh of the fish whereas in earlier times fish were immediately eviscerated and the larvae disposed of together with the entrails. Rabbi Landau asserts that herring, one of the species subject to parasite infestation, were always salted for extended periods of time and that the fish were placed in salt without prior removal of internal organs because those organs enhance the taste of the herring.</p>
<p>Rabbi Landau&#x2019;s halakhic argument is based upon one salient point. The survival of the parasites in question is attributed to the manner in which they are transferred from one aquatic species to another. Larger fish prey upon smaller fish infested with live parasites. The parasites deposit eggs in the intestines of the predator. Those eggs are excreted by the larger fish together with a glob of nutrients needed to sustain the larvae upon hatching. The vast majority of those eggs fall to the floor of the ocean and are destroyed. A small percent of the eggs are consumed by krill and hatch within the krill. The krill are then consumed by larger kosher fish and the parasites make their way into the flesh of the fish brought to market. Rabbi Landau focuses upon the fact that the eggs, prior to hatching, do not have the power of locomotion and hence cannot be categorized as creatures that &#x201C;creep in the water.&#x201D; His novel point is that the eggs of the parasite are not prohibited. Rabbi Landau notes that <italic>Sifra</italic> 4:12, as understood by Ra&#x2019;avad, <italic>ad locum</italic>, establishes that secretions, skin and eggs of forbidden birds are prohibited on the basis of a pleonasm in the biblical text that records the biblical prohibition. But in a parallel statement, <italic>Sifra</italic> 4:8, according to Ra&#x2019;avad, prohibits secretions of forbidden marine creatures lacking fins and scales but fails to include eggs within the ambit of that prohibition.</p>
<p>However, the statement of <italic>Sifra</italic> appears to be problematic. There is a general rule to the effect that any substance secreted by a forbidden creature (<italic>ha-yo&#x1E93;ei min ha-tame</italic>) is itself forbidden. If so, even absent a specific pleonasm, the eggs of all forbidden creatures, including eggs of marine parasites, would be forbidden. Rabbi Landau explains the need for a pleonasm as recorded in <italic>Sifra</italic> by citing <italic>Pri &#x1E24;adash, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 103:1, and <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E92;ema&#x1E25; &#x1E92;edek, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 63, sec. 3, who state that since insects and the like are repulsive they would not qualify as a &#x201C;food&#x201D; and hence would not be included in the category of forbidden species but for the fact that they are explicitly proscribed as a foodstuff despite their repugnance. That biblical prohibition, argues Rabbi Landau, applies only to the creeping creatures themselves. Since such creatures are inherently repugnant, the independent general prohibition against secretions emitted by forbidden creatures is not attendant upon creeping organisms. Hence, contends Rabbi Landau, since eggs are not enumerated by <italic>Sifra</italic> 4:8 as being explicitly prohibited, there is no basis to deem the eggs of insects and the like to be forbidden as the secretion of a forbidden creature.</p>
<p>Accordingly, argues Rabbi Landau, there is no reason to regard the parasites as forbidden until the eggs hatch as larvae and become organisms that &#x201C;creep in the water.&#x201D; But, asserts Rabbi Landau, Anisakis larvae emerge only within the body of the host fish. Hence, concludes Rabbi Landau, since at no time in the course of their development did the parasites &#x201C;creep in the water,&#x201D; there is no basis to prohibit them when found in kosher fish. The presence in the water of eggs from which the parasites develop is regarded by Rabbi Landau as inconsequential since the eggs are &#x201C;disgusting&#x201D; and hence are not a foodstuff.</p>
<p>R. Shmu&#x2019;el Shmelka Friedman, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el,</italic> no. 61, p. 19, similarly asserts that a creature that has not actually &#x201C;swarmed&#x201D; in water is not forbidden. Rabbi Friedman regards the eggs of &#x201C;creeping creatures&#x201D; as permissible for a different reason. As explained in the Gemara, the eggs even of kosher fowl would be forbidden as <italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic>, i.e., as the product of a forbidden organ of a living creature, but for the fact that the Torah specifically permits consumption of eggs. As explained by <italic>Tosafot, &#x1E24;ullin</italic> 64a, the eggs of a member of a forbidden species would also have been included in that dispensation and are forbidden solely on the basis of a pleonasm. Since there is no similar pleonasm governing the status of eggs of insects, argues Rabbi Friedman, the prohibition of <italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic> does not apply; rather, the eggs of insects are included in the general exclusion of eggs from the prohibition of <italic>yo&#x1E93;ei.</italic></p>
<p>However, the facts as presented in the scientific literature are somewhat at variance from the scenario described by Rabbi Landau. Rabbi Landau speaks of the deposit of &#x201C;eggs&#x201D; in the sea and the ingestion of the &#x201C;eggs&#x201D; of the parasite by krill. It appears that, as has been explained earlier, at least at the time of ingestion by krill, the nascent creatures are not eggs but have already hatched as larvae. Presumably, Rabbi Landau would counter that since larvae do not have the power of locomotion and do not &#x201C;swarm in the water&#x201D; their status is indistinguishable from the status of eggs. But that, too, is contrafactual. As noted earlier, larvae are animated and do propel themselves in the water. Indeed, some scientists theorize that it is the wriggling in the water that attracts the krill.</p>
<p>The novel points in Rabbi Landau&#x2019;s thesis are: 1) eggs of &#x201C;swarming&#x201D; creatures are not prohibited;<sup><xref rid="fn398">79</xref></sup> and 2) organisms not yet capable of independent locomotion are not &#x201C;creeping things&#x201D; and hence are no different from &#x201C;eggs&#x201D; for halakhic purposes.</p>
<p>There are yet other grounds to argue that larvae and &#x201C;swarming creatures&#x201D; hatched from eggs are not included in the category of <italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic>. The Gemara, <italic>Temurah</italic> 31a, declares that the prohibition of <italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic> is not attendant upon a bird hatched from an egg because the egg turns to mere &#x201C;dust&#x201D; before the embryo develops.<sup><xref rid="fn399">80</xref></sup> The same principle would apply to fish hatched from eggs.</p>
<p>Arguably, it is possible to accept Rabbi Landau&#x2019;s second assertion maintaining that the Anisakis is not forbidden because it does not &#x201C;swarm in the water&#x201D; and to apply it in practice without also accepting his primary thesis establishing that the restrictions regarding <italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic> do not apply to eggs or larvae of such species. Developing that argument, however, requires reformulating Rabbi Landau&#x2019;s thesis by predicating it upon an entirely different premise.</p>
<p>In comments published in <italic>&#x1E24;iddushei ha-Gra&#x1E25; al ha-Shas</italic>, ed. Y. Cohen (Jerusalem, 5729), <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 67a, the <italic>Brisker Rav</italic>, R. Yitzchak Ze&#x2019;ev Soloveitchik, is quoted as espousing the position that, although identity as a member of a forbidden animal species is established by progenital relationship without regard to the presence or absence in the progeny of the anatomical criteria enumerated by Scripture, that is not the case with regard to <italic>shera&#x1E93;im</italic> or &#x201C;swarming things.&#x201D; The <italic>Brisker Rav</italic> observes that Scripture neither names species forbidden as &#x201C;creeping things&#x201D; nor does it spell out identifying criteria. The prohibition is couched simply in the phrase &#x201C;all swarming things that swarm upon the earth you shall not eat&#x201D; (Leviticus 11:42). Accordingly, he argues, the fact that the organism &#x201C;swarms&#x201D; is the determining factor in establishing the prohibited nature of such a creature.<sup><xref rid="fn400">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>In establishing that thesis, the <italic>Brisker Rav</italic> cites an intriguing rule recorded by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;akhalot Assurot</italic> 3:8. A single creature may be thrice prohibited, namely as 1) a swarming land creature, 2) a swarming aquatic creature and 3) a swarming flying creature. Since consumption of creatures that creep on land, swarm in water and those that fly are each prohibited by a separate negative commandment, Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;akhalot Assurot</italic> 2:23, rules that a person who consumes a land creature that reproduces in bodies of water and also sprouts wings is punished by having the statutory number of stripes administered three times. Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;akhalot Assurot</italic> 3:8, further rules that a person who consumes an unhatched bird incurs punishment for violation of the prohibition against consuming &#x201C;winged swarming things that go upon all fours&#x201D; (Leviticus 11:20). Even though, if eaten only upon hatching, punishment incurred in eating such a creature would be for consuming an &#x201C;unclean bird,&#x201D; nevertheless, while yet in the egg, its appearance is that of a &#x201C;swarming&#x201D; creature and punishment is for consuming a &#x201C;winged swarming thing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thus, although R. Chaim Soloveitchik is quoted as having famously declared, &#x201C;A horse is a horse, not because it is a horse, but because its mother was a horse,&#x201D; nevertheless, a &#x201C;swarming thing&#x201D; is a &#x201C;swarming thing&#x201D; because it itself creeps and hence, arguably, only if it actually creeps. If so, as Rabbi Landau has argued, a creature acquires the status of one that &#x201C;swarms in the water&#x201D; only if it actually &#x201C;swarms&#x201D; in the water&#x2014; but not if it &#x201C;swarms&#x201D; only within a host fish.</p>
<p>It is possible that the <italic>Brisker Rav</italic> would concede that the secretions&#x2014; and even the eggs of&#x2014;a creature that &#x201C;swarms in the water&#x201D; are forbidden as <italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic>, but would maintain that only when the egg metamorphasizes into an independently animated creature is its status dependent upon whether or not it &#x201C;swarms.&#x201D; Alternatively, it is conceivable that the <italic>Brisker Rav</italic> might concur in the thesis that, in banning only a creature having the appearance of a &#x201C;swarming thing,&#x201D; the Torah has obviated the stricture regarding <italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic> with regard to &#x201C;swarming things.&#x201D; Of course, the objection that the larvae themselves, as distinct from eggs, are &#x201C;swarming things&#x201D; remains cogent.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this conclusion, as well as that of Rabbi Landau, appears to be incorrect. In the above-cited ruling of Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;akhalot Assurot</italic> 3:8, regarding an unhatched embryo endowed with wings, Rambam rules that the unhatched embryo of a forbidden bird possessing wings is a <italic>shere&#x1E93; ha-of</italic>, i.e., a swarming bird-creature. That prohibition attaches to the unhatched creature despite the fact that its wings were never used and it never engaged in flight.<sup><xref rid="fn401">82</xref></sup> It might be countered that, despite the grammatical identity of the two phrases, the phrase &#x201C;<italic>mi-kol shere&#x1E93; hamayim</italic>&#x201D;(Leviticus 11:10) translates literally as &#x201C;of all that swarms in water&#x201D; while <italic>kol shere&#x1E93; ha-of</italic> (Leviticus 10:20) should be translated as &#x201C;all of the swarming birds,&#x201D; i.e., creatures having <italic>capacity</italic> for flight but not necessarily creatures that have flown. More likely, in both the case of a <italic>shere&#x1E93; ha-of</italic> and in the case of a <italic>shere&#x1E93; ha-mayim</italic>, it is the &#x201C;<italic>to&#x2019;ar</italic>&#x201D; (to use the terminology of the <italic>Brisker Rav</italic>), i.e., the appearance or physical characteristics of the creature that are determinative rather than the actual performance of the activity common to such creatures. Hence, any organism having the appearance of a creature that &#x201C;swarms in water&#x201D; would be prohibited even if that creature has not actually swarmed in water.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Gemara, in telling us that worms found between the skin and the flesh are permissible because they are generated by the fish itself, seems to negate the notion that only creatures that actually swarm in the water are forbidden. Were that the case, creatures originating within the fish itself would be permitted because of that reason&#x2014;a reason more fundamental and more inclusive than the reason actually advanced by the Gemara, i.e., that they are generated from the flesh of the fish.<sup><xref rid="fn402">83</xref></sup></p>
<h1>VIII. <italic>Examination for Parasites</italic></h1>
<p>Despite his strong insistence that the creatures found in many species of fish are forbidden, Rabbi Karp, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 61, pp. 38-48, rules permissively with regard to consumption of herring without examination. Rabbi Karp reports that initial examination of sample quantities of herring yielded no parasites but that a second examination found thirty percent of whole herring to be infested. He quite plausibly attributes the disparity to the fact that the second examination was conducted by use of an electric light-box or blue light. That type of examination is not possible for the ordinary consumer.</p>
<p>The crucial consideration is that a clear majority of the fish in question are free of infestation. Nevertheless, presence of insects in a significant minority of fish, a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic>, does necessitate examination by virtue of rabbinic decree.<sup><xref rid="fn403">84</xref></sup> Rashba, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 9b and <italic>Torat ha-Bayit he-Arukh, bayit sheni, sha&#x2019;ar shlishi</italic>, followed by <italic>Pri Megadim, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 39:introduction, and <italic>idem, Siftei Da&#x2019;at</italic> 39:2, explain that the Sages required such examination because failure to do so is comparable &#x201C;to averting one&#x2019;s eyes from that which is forbidden.&#x201D; Despite the clear presence of infestation in a significant minority of fish, Rabbi Karp finds examination of the fish in question to be unnecessary for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As has been shown earlier, insects found even in the intestines of a fish are forbidden only because of doubt with regard to their origin. Although this view is disputed by <italic>Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 17, <italic>Teshuvot Bet Efrayim, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 6, rules that there is no requirement to examine for the presence of something that is only doubtfully prohibited. R. Shalom Mordecai Schwadron, <italic>Da&#x2019;at Torah, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 39:introduction, sec. 1 and <italic>Kanfei Yonah</italic> 31 concur in that opinion.<sup><xref rid="fn404">85</xref></sup></li>
<li>In line with Rashba&#x2019;s explanation that examination is required because failure to examine is tantamount to &#x201C;averting one&#x2019;s eyes,&#x201D; Rabbi Karp contends that the concept of &#x201C;a significant minority&#x201D; applies only to a minority that, if actually present, is likely to be discerned in the normal course of eating the possibly infested foodstuff. The parasites within the fish in question, even if present, will never be perceived by a person eating the fish.</li>
<li>R. Shlomoh Kluger, <italic>Teshuvot Tuv Ta&#x2019;am va-Da&#x2019;at, Mahadura Tinyana, Kuntres A&#x1E25;aron,</italic> no. 53, maintains that since, as Rashba declares, the obligation to conduct an examination is because failure to do so is tantamount &#x201C;to averting one&#x2019;s eyes,&#x201D; there is no obligation to search for such creatures with a magnifying glass even though, when discerned, they can be perceived with the naked eye.<sup><xref rid="fn405">86</xref></sup> His position is that, although averting one&#x2019;s eyes is forbidden, it is not necessary to actively enhance the possibility of discerning the presence of such creatures.</li>
<li>When examination for the presence of a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic> is not possible, no examination is required. <italic>Pri Megadim, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 39:introduction and <italic>Tevu&#x2019;ot Shor</italic> 1:3, rule that examination that requires inordinate travail or inconvenience is similarly not required. Examination by means of a light-box or the like, argues Rabbi Karp, falls into that category.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, none of those considerations apply in situations in which the majority of the suspected fish are known to be infested. Rabbi Karp, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 61, p. 47, considers such to be the case with regard to salmon and sole in particular.</p>
<p>R. Moshe Chaim Padwa of London, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 61, p. 15, finds grounds to permit eating doubtfully infested fish after they have been cooked. <italic>Taz, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:17, permitted consumption of baked foods containing raisins that might have been contaminated by ants on the basis of a <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> or &#x201C;double doubt&#x201D;: 1) the presence of ants in the raisins was doubtful; 2) even if present, the ants may have been crushed in preparing the dough and hence been nullified in the much larger quantity of flour and other ingredients. However, <italic>Nekudat ha-Kesef, loc. cit.,</italic> disagrees and maintains that a <italic>safek ha-ragil</italic>, i.e., doubt with regard to a forbidden substance the presence of which is &#x201C;usual,&#x201D; does not qualify as a &#x201C;doubt&#x201D; for this purpose.<sup><xref rid="fn406">87</xref></sup> As stated by <italic>Shakh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:29, that is the case when infestation is known to have occurred in such environs. <italic>Pri Megadim, Mishbe&#x1E93;ot Zahav</italic> 84:16, comments that one should not protest if a lenient ruling has been issued in such a case in an instance of &#x201C;great loss and enjoyment of <italic>Yom Tov</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<h1>IX. <italic>Concluding Observations</italic></h1>
<p>The Anisakis controversy is born of a confrontation between the principles governing nature accepted by the Sages and the conclusions of contemporary science. In other instances of such conflict, e.g., spontaneous generation of &#x201C;<italic>kinim</italic>&#x201D; versus sexual reproduction, methodology for resolving the confrontation requires that we either a) reject the findings of science as false;<sup><xref rid="fn407">88</xref></sup> b) assert that Halakhah as transmitted by Moses at Sinai is predicated upon real or perceived reality at that time;<sup><xref rid="fn408">89</xref></sup> c) redefine the relevant talmudic statements as references to extinct or otherwise unobservable entities or phenomena; or d) redefine the talmudic concepts in a manner that renders them non-literal.</p>
<p>Application of these diverse methods to resolution of the Anisakis problem yields diverse results. The Gemara declares organisms found within the flesh of fish to be permissible because they are not generated outside the muscle tissue. That claim is difficult to maintain when identical organisms are also present in the digestive organs, particularly when the walls of those organs are punctured (presumably by the organisms present in the digestive tract) and the punctures are large enough to accommodate migration of those organisms. Nor is it possible to assert that the talmudic statements reflect the reality of antiquity since the talmudic discussion focuses on empirical evidence employed to determine whether the worms in question were generated outside the fish. Hence those who permit the Anisakis found in the flesh of fish are forced to ascribe the genesis of those organisms to spontaneous generation no matter how implausible that conclusion may be.</p>
<p>Assertion that nature has changed and that either present-day products of spontaneous generation constitute a null class or that they are unidentifiable by us would yield a diametrically opposed position. The result would be acceptance of the conclusion that all aquatic organisms presently found in any area of the fish are forbidden.</p>
<p>Those who forbid Anisakis and similar parasites but not other organisms assess the talmudic statements in one of two ways. Some limit the relevant talmudic presumption to organisms with regard to which there is no compelling evidence disproving the possibility of spontaneous generation and prohibit only species found both in the viscera and flesh but accept the talmudic statements as presumptive and hence controlling only where there is no compelling evidence to the contrary. They do not regard the relevant talmudic statements as universal and irrebuttable and, consequently, their conclusion prohibiting Anisakis and permitting other species is not inconsistent.</p>
<p>Other authorities redefine the underlying talmudic principle, not as enunciating a principle of spontaneous generation, but as a declaration that subvisual phenomena are to be disregarded. Upon redefinition of the principle, the application involves no inconsistency or difficulty whatsoever. Any and all organisms imbibed at a stage at which they can be perceived by the naked eye are forbidden. Those imbibed while not yet visible and found in the flesh of the fish, since they have no prior juridical identity, are treated as having been generated by the fish itself. Those found in the digestive tract, even if imbibed in a subvisual state, do not develop by parasitic feeding upon the flesh of the host but appropriate to themselves nutrients eaten by the fish that are found in the digestive organs and hence are treated no differently from organisms that feed in the water outside the fish.</p>
<p>In the opinion of this writer, the halakhic arguments of those who prohibit Anisakis-infested fish are compelling. Moreover, their resolution of the underlying confrontation serves to affirm the veracity of talmudic teaching without ignoring empirical reality and does so in a manner that is intellectually consistent.</p>
<ftnote id="fn320">1. The Gemara, <italic>Bava Batra</italic> 75a, declares that in the eschatological era God will prepare a feast for the righteous at which the Leviathan will be served. R. Elijah Levita, known as R. Elijah Ba&#x1E25;ur, <italic>Tishbi,</italic> s.v. <italic>Yukhnah</italic>, records a tradition to the effect that both the Leviathan and the <italic>shor ha-bar</italic>, a legendary wild ox, will be featured at this banquet<italic>.</italic> A folk witticism has it that the Leviathan will be available to those who will request fish since even then they will be unwilling to rely upon the <italic>kashrut</italic> of the meat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn321">2. R. Moshe Mordecai Karp, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el,</italic> no. 54 (Tevet 5769), p. 63 and no. 56 (Tammuz 5769), p. 49, reports that wild salmon imported from Norway and Chile have not been found to be infested. Those salmon do, however, require examination for the presence of lice on the skin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn322">3. Rabbi Karp, <italic>loc. cit</italic>., also reports that sole imported from Holland are free of infestation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn323">4. See R. Schneur Zalman Revach, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 56, p. 48.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn324">5. A similar problem was reported thereafter by R. Pesach Eliyahu Falk, <italic>Madrikh le-Bedikat Tola&#x2019;im</italic>: <italic>Guide to the Inspection of Fruits and Vegetables for Insects</italic> (Gateshead, 5744), p. 92, with regard to cod, whiting and a number of other fish. As reported in &#x201C;Advisory Pamphlet No. 29,&#x201D; published by the British Ministry of Agriculture, fertilized eggs of parasites living in the stomach of seal pass into the sea with excreta of the seal. The eggs hatch into microscopic worms that are swallowed by a shrimp-like aquatic animal. Cod become infested by eating the shrimp-like organism or small fish containing the tiny worm. The life cycle of the organism is completed when the seal eats the infested cod.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn325">6. That problem involved a worm called <italic>Triaenophorus crassus</italic> and was quite similar to the problem involving the Anisakis. <italic>Triaenophorus</italic> thrive in the intestines of pike. The adult worm releases its eggs in the spring when the pike spawns and then dies. The microscopic eggs are released into the water by the pike. The eggs hatch into larvae known as coracidia and are covered by hair-like filaments that enable them to move in the water. Coracidia are microscopic and will perish within approximately two weeks unless consumed by another creature. Coracidia are eaten by zooplankton and evolve into a second larval stage called a procercoid. A procercoid can grow to a length of over 300 microns at which stage it is visible to a diligent observer. The procercoid will die in approximately one month unless the zooplankton is consumed by a fish.</ftnote>
<ftnote>When the zooplankton is eaten and digested by a whitefish the procercoid is released into the stomach of its host. Within hours it develops into a tiny microscopic worm. The infinitesimal worm releases enzymes that enable it to penetrate the stomach wall and embed itself in the muscle tissue of the whitefish. The whitefish reacts to the alien organism by encapsulating it within a small cyst within which the <italic>Triaenophorus crassus</italic> develops into a thin organism between four and fifteen inches in length. The worm can survive in that habitat for some three or four years but as the cyst gradually shrivels it will die without progeny. However, if the whitefish is eaten by a pike before the encysted worm dies, it will escape from the cyst and live to maturity within the viscera of the pike where it will spawn the following spring and restart the cycle. The problem was encountered when the cysts containing the worms were discovered in infested whitefish.</ftnote>

<ftnote>In his unpublished essay, Rabbi Gershon Bess reports that worms have been found only in the intestines of a certain species of hake processed in Argentina whereas the flesh of the same fish processed in China is highly infested. In China, the fish are only partially eviscerated after being caught and are not kept in a cold state with the result that, as the fish warms, the worms migrate to the flesh.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Rabbi Bess further reports that an experiment was conducted by <italic>kashrut</italic> supervisors in Norway. Thousands of herring were frozen at -2&#x00B0; centigrade. Upon examination, no parasites were found in their flesh. Ten fish were left unfrozen and allowed to warm for a day after their capture. The flesh of nine of those ten herring were found to be infested with parasites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn339">20. Actually, the Gemara discusses rules applying to animals but does not explicitly refer to fish. <italic>Tosafot, ad locum</italic>, state that the underlying principle applies equally to fish.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn340">21. R. Ephraim Zalman Margulies, <italic>Teshuvot Bet Efrayim,Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 25, writes that, even when found on the external surface of the entrails, such organisms are forbidden. See, <italic>infra</italic>, note 50 and accompanying text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn341">22. As understood by Rashi and <italic>Tosafot</italic>, the Gemara, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 67b, indicates that such creatures are also forbidden when found in the liver or lungs of the animal or of the fish on the suspicion that they entered through the &#x201C;nostrils.&#x201D; <italic>&#x1E24;iddushei R. Akiva Eger, ad locum</italic>, adds the phrase &#x201C;or in the brain&#x201D; reflecting the possibility that the worms might have entered through the nose and penetrated the cranial cavity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn342">23. <italic>Pri Megadim, Siftei Da&#x2019;at</italic> 84:43, indicates that such creatures are prohibited, not with certainty, but as a matter of doubt since their presence within the digestive organs strongly suggests that they originated outside the fish. This view was expressed much earlier by <italic>Issur ve-Hetter he-Arukh, sha&#x2019;ar</italic> 41, sec. 15. The Gemara found no reason to assume that organisms found elsewhere within the fish originated outside the fish and hence, if found under the skin or in the flesh of the fish, they are permitted. The matter can best be categorized as an application of the principal &#x201C;<italic>ka&#x2019;an nim&#x1E93;a ka&#x2019;an &#x1E25;ayah</italic>&#x2014;what is found here was always here [and not elsewhere]&#x201D; other than in situations in which there exists a <italic>rei&#x2019;uta</italic>, or unusual factor, giving rise to suspicion of the contrary.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Consistent with that principle, <italic>Knesset ha-Gedolah</italic>, followed by <italic>Ba&#x1E25;</italic> and <italic>Yam shel Shlomoh</italic> in his commentaries on <italic>Sefer ha-Terumot</italic> and on <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 3:104, concludes that worms are permitted only if found in a whole fish and upon examination it is ascertained that there is no lesion through which the worms might have entered. However, once the fish has been cut, any worms that are found are forbidden because of the fear that, in cutting the fish, they may have penetrated the flesh from the viscera.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn343">24. See, however, <italic>Ba&#x1E25;, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84, <italic>Knesset ha-Gedolah, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:101 and <italic>Yam shel Shlomoh, &#x1E24;ullin</italic> 3:106, who permit such creatures only when found between the skin and the flesh. See <italic>infra</italic>, note 25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn344">25. Rashi identifies the &#x201C;<italic>darni</italic>&#x201D; explicitly permitted by the Gemara, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 67b, as &#x201C;worms found between the skin and the flesh.&#x201D; Rashba, <italic>Torat ha-Bayit ha-Ka&#x1E93;er, bayit slishi, sha&#x2019;ar shlishi</italic>, adds the phrase &#x201C;or in the flesh&#x201D; and that emendation is incorporated by virtually all subsequent authorities.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn345">26. Nevertheless, when detached or separated from the fish, such worms are forbidden because of <italic>ma&#x2019;arit ayin</italic>, i.e., because they appear to be forbidden creatures. Contrary to other authorities, <italic>Shakh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:46, permits such creatures as long as they remain in the plate in which they are served but forbids them once they leave the plate for another surface. Cf., <italic>Pri &#x1E24;adash, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:9 and <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Adam</italic> 38:29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn346">27. R. Hai Ga&#x2019;on, <italic>She&#x2019;iltot</italic>, <italic>Parashat Shemini</italic>, <italic>she&#x2019;ilta</italic> 4, explains that, since such creatures are generated by the flesh of the fish or animal, they have the halakhic status of their progenitor.</ftnote>
<ftnote>It is generally presumed that the Gemara asserts that such creatures arise in the flesh of their host as a result of spontaneous generation. However, Rashi, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 67b, defines the term &#x201C;<italic>gavli</italic>&#x201D; in the phrase <italic>mineih gavli</italic> as meaning &#x201C;<italic>gadli,</italic>&#x201D; i.e., &#x201C;grow&#x201D; or develop.&#x201D; That understanding is entirely consistent with the notion that the parasites enter the flesh while yet microscopic in nature&#x2014;and hence are accorded no halakhic cognizance&#x2014;and later develop within the flesh. Since their existence is recognized only when they become visually perceivable within the flesh of the host, their halakhic identity is that of the host in which they &#x201C;grow&#x201D; or &#x201C;develop.&#x201D; See <italic>infra</italic>, note 57.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn347">28. Only worms generated in the flesh of an animal after it has been slaughtered are permitted; a worm generated in the flesh while the animal is yet alive is forbidden as &#x201C;an organ torn from a living creature.&#x201D; Since the worm enjoys independent animation, it is not rendered permissible by the slaughter of its host. Fish do not require slaughter and are not subject to the prohibition against an organ torn from a living creature. Hence, worms generated by the flesh of a fish, even when the fish is yet alive, are permitted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn348">29. Rambam clearly affirms the spontaneous generation of such worms. In his <italic>Sefer ha-Mi&#x1E93;vot, lo ta&#x2019;aseh</italic>, no. 179, Rambam describes those who deny that phenomenon as &#x201C;fools who have no knowledge of science.&#x201D; See also Rambam, <italic>Commentary on the Mishnah, Shabbat</italic> 126b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn349">30. In explaining the similar position of <italic>Sefer ha-Terumot, Knesset ha-Gedolah, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:101, suggests that &#x201C;<italic>darna</italic>&#x201D; (plural, <italic>darni</italic>) is the name of a particular species that was known to the Sages to be generated by the flesh of an animal or fish but expresses uncertainty with regard to whether that statement is to be accepted paradigmatically as permitting other species regarding which that fact is not known with certainty. <italic>Migdal Oz, Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;akhalot Assurot</italic> 2:17, declares that only the species known as <italic>darni</italic> are permitted. The identity of that species is unknown to us.</ftnote>
<ftnote><italic>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, IV, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 83 and VII, no. 127, sec. 3, also asserts that &#x201C;<italic>darna</italic>&#x201D; is the name of a specific species but, unlike <italic>Migdal Oz</italic>, he regards it as a paradigm for all such species. Nevertheless, <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> agrees that only creatures known with certainty to generate within the fish are permitted. See also, <italic>infra</italic>, note 57 and accompanying text.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Cf., an unpublished responsum authored by R. Pesach Eliyahu Falk, quoted by R. Levi Baum, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 60, p. 59, who cites <italic>Shabbat</italic> 54b, 70a and 102b in arguing that &#x201C;<italic>darni</italic>&#x201D; is a generic term for numerous species of worms. There is however, a variant reading in which the term &#x201C;<italic>murani</italic>&#x201D; (rather than &#x201C;<italic>darni</italic>&#x201D;) appears in the texts of <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 67b<italic>. Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:1, speaks of &#x201C;worms&#x201D; and hence certainly did not accept the notion that the provision is limited to a particular species.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn350">31. R. David Arama, in a gloss on Rambam, <italic>ad locum</italic>, published in the Shabbetai Frankel edition of the <italic>Mishneh Torah</italic> in the section titled <italic>Likkutim</italic>, explains Rambam&#x2019;s position in a manner that renders forbidden even insects that are known with certainty to have been generated by the flesh of a live fish. Worms that develop in a fruit after it has been plucked are not deemed to be creatures that &#x201C;creep on the earth&#x201D; until they emerge from the fruit. However, if they develop while the fruit is still attached to the tree, which itself is rooted in the ground, the worms are prohibited. Similarly, asserts this authority, a fish while alive in water is &#x201C;attached&#x201D; to the water with the result that all insects that develop in a live fish, even if they are generated in the flesh of the fish, are forbidden because they &#x201C;creep in the water,&#x201D; i.e., in the fish that is regarded as attached to the water. (Cf., <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 201:33 regarding ritual immersion.) Hence, only insects that develop in the flesh of the fish, i.e., after it has died, are permissible. That analysis of Rambam&#x2019;s position is developed at length by R. Shlomoh Amar in his letter of approbation to <italic>Tola&#x2019;at Shani</italic>, reprinted in <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 54, pp. 30-32.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn355">36.

<ftnote id="fn360">41. The notion of certainty voiced by these authorities must assuredly be understood not in the sense of logical certainty but as connoting the absence of any cogent reason for suspecting otherwise. See <italic>supra</italic>, note 23. The crucial point is that the cited statements unequivocally indicate that the rules established by the Gemara are not universal and do not apply when &#x201C;certainty&#x201D; is dispelled by contradictory evidence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn361">42. Cf., R. Moshe Roth, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 57 (Tishri 5770), pp. 153f., and R. Asher Anshel Eckstein, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el,</italic> no. 54, p. 61, who unconvincingly strain to interpret those authorities in a manner that renders their comments compatible with the position of other decisors. Cf., also, an unpublished responsum of Rabbi Falk cited in addenda to <italic>Ve-Anokhi Tola&#x2019;at</italic>, p. 41, in which Rabbi Falk argues that these sources establish the opposite point, <italic>viz.</italic>, that they declare that under no circumstances can worms found in the flesh of the fish be prohibited. His understanding leads to an argument quite similar to the argument made by other writers with regard to the terminology employed by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> 84:16. See <italic>infra</italic>, note 51 and accompanying text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn362">43. See <italic>infra</italic>, note 57 and accompanying text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn363">44. A direct association has been found between the number of parasites found in the viscera and the number found in the flesh, a fact that certainly suggests a common origin. See Smith and Wooten, &#x201C;Experimental Studies&#x201D; cited <italic>supra</italic>, note 38.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn364">45. That contention, however, is contradicted by one source. <italic>Hagahot Sha&#x2019;arei Dura, Hilkhot Tola&#x2019;im</italic> 47:2, describes certain worms that migrate from the flesh of the fish into the intestine and later return to the flesh of the fish. <italic>Hagahot Sha&#x2019;arei Dura</italic> regards those worms as permissible &#x201C;because it is obvious and known that such worms are generated in the flesh.&#x201D; The implication is that, when found in the intestines as well as in the flesh, even the worms found in the intestine are permitted. Rabbi Halberstam, addenda to <italic>Ve-Anokhi Tola&#x2019;at</italic>, p. 43, understands the reference to be to worms generally found to be in the flesh but only rarely in the intestines. That, he asserts, was accepted by <italic>Sha&#x2019;arei Dura</italic> as evidence that even the worms found in the intestine originated in the flesh of the fish. Moreover, that statement is missing in many editions of <italic>Sha&#x2019;arei Dura</italic> and is not quoted by later authorities who cite <italic>Sha&#x2019;arei Dura</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn365">46. See <italic>Tola&#x2019;at Shani,</italic> II, 191. On page 96 of that work, Rabbi Revach reproduces a photograph clearly picturing such holes in the flesh of infested salmon. See also the photograph published in <italic>Parasitology International,</italic> described <italic>infra,</italic> note 53. Somewhat astonishingly, Rabbi Roth, cited <italic>supra</italic>, note 42, denies that, even if such perforations exist, the parasites are capable of passing through them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn366">47. R. Joseph Mordecai Silver, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 54, pp.62ff. and no. 56, pp. 67f., concedes that parasites found in the flesh may have had their origin in the digestive tract but asserts that they migrate while yet subvisual eggs and hence are deemed to be the product of the flesh. That suggestion must be rejected in light of the evidence demonstrating that migration takes place after the death of the fish which would not allow sufficient time for the development of an egg into a mature parasite.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn367">48. Rabbi Roth, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 57, p. 153, further asserts that any creature entering through the mouth of the fish will be digested by the fish. Accordingly, he understands the Gemara as postulating that worms found in the intestines either originate in the tissue of the intestine itself or, as stated by the Gemara, are imbibed &#x201C;through the nostrils while the fish is asleep.&#x201D; As will be shown later, that presumption is contrafactual and, moreover, there is no compelling reason to interpret the Gemara&#x2019;s discussion in that manner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn368">49. See the distinction made in another context by R. Shalom Mordecai Schwadron, <italic>Da&#x2019;at Torah, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 31:20, based upon the direction which the worm&#x2019;s head faces.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn369">50. Those authorities clearly contradict the assertion of R. Israel Belsky concerning the status of worms found in the abdominal cavity as presented in his essay posted on http://www.zootorah.com/Rav&#x005F;Belskys&#x005F;Teshuva&#x005F;about&#x005F;worms&#x005F; in&#x005F;fish.doc. Rabbi Belsky&#x2019;s intemperate remarks concerning those who prohibit Anasakis contain the canard that the many eminent authorities who ruled permissively with regard to the same issue raised in the 1990s but more recently prohibited Anasakis did so because of misinformation now presented to them. As has been documented herein that is patently incorrect. The substantive points in that article have been discussed in the earlier published literature. The online article has now been published in <italic>Mesorah</italic>, no. 25 (&#x1E24;eshvan, 5772), and in Rabbi Belsky&#x2019;s <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an ha-Levi</italic> (Modi&#x2019;in Illit, 5771), <italic>&#x1E24;elek Birurei Halakhah</italic>, no. 23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn370">51. In an earlier article, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 54, p. 25, Rabbi Bloom dismisses the argument based upon <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh&#x2019;s</italic> codification in the form of a universal rule with the comment that <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> had no need to record the obvious point that the codified rule applies only in circumstances in which the underlying rationale pertains.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn371">52. See <italic>supra</italic>, note 30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn372">53. A less convincing form of this experiment has already been conducted. Rabbi Halberstam, <italic>Ve-Anokhi Tola&#x2019;at</italic>, p. 18, reports that fish raised in water that did not harbor &#x201C;shrimp,&#x201D; as is generally the case with regard to fish raised in aqua culture, were found to be free of infestation. Those fish were then transferred to water in which shrimp made their habitat. A plethora of worms were subsequently found in those fish. See also <italic>Tola&#x2019;at Shani</italic>, II, 192. Those who are unconvinced by that demonstration would presumably respond that, while parasites found in the digestive tract did indeed originate in the organisms upon which the fish feed, those found in the flesh were coincidentally produced by spontaneous generation. It would, however, be preposterous to attribute an identical genetic modification to mere coincidence.</ftnote>
<ftnote>A report of a similar scientific experiment appeared in <italic>Parasitology International</italic>. A quantity of hatchery-bred rainbow trout were placed in a tank. Anisakis larvae were embedded in feed pellets and fed to the trout orally immediately after preparation of the pellets. Other trout were fed larvae-free pellets as a control. The fish were maintained in the experimental tank for 35 days. During the balance of that period all trout were fed uncontaminated pellets. Fish were removed from the tank at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days post-infestation. Worms were recovered both from the body cavity and muscle tissue at each of those times. Sections of body muscle were thinly sliced, pressed between two glass plates placed under a stereo-microscope and examined for the presence of larvae migrating into muscle tissue. Photographs were published showing a larva penetrating the hypaxial muscle in which the anterior end of the larva is wedged into the body muscle and the posterior end remains in the body cavity of the host fish. Also published is a picture of a histological section of infested muscles showing the presence of broken muscle tissue surrounding the Anisakis. No signs of infestation was found in the control group. See Karl Marx, A. Quiazon, Tomoyoshi Yoshinaga and Kazuo Ogawa, &#x201C;Experimental Challenge of <italic>Anisakis simplex</italic> sensu strict and <italic>Anisakis pegreffi</italic> (Nemotada: Anisakidae) in Rainbow Trout and Olive Flounder,&#x201D; <italic>Parasitology International</italic> (2011).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn373">54. See also this volume, pp. 203-217. Rejection of this basic premise is the central thesis of Rabbi Halberstam&#x2019;s <italic>Kuntres Ayin Lo Ra&#x2019;atah</italic>, also appended to his <italic>Yad le-Mikveh</italic>. Rabbi Halberstam&#x2019;s view was earlier enunciated by Rabbi Abraham Jacob Zeleznick, Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivat Eitz Chaim in Jerusalem, and originally published in a little-known Israeli journal. The letter is reprinted as an appendix to <italic>Ayin Lo Ra&#x2019;atah</italic>, p. 36. In support of his position, Rabbi Halberstam, <italic>ibid,</italic> pp. 27-28, 31 and 44, cites terminology employed by <italic>Me&#x2019;orei Or</italic>, cited by <italic>Darkei Teshuvah, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84:59, and two works of R. Shlomoh Kluger, <italic>Teshuvot Tuv Ta&#x2019;am va-Da&#x2019;at, Mahadura Tinyana, Kuntres A&#x1E25;aron</italic>, no.53, and <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Shlomoh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 84. [This writer has been unable to locate the source cited in <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Shlomoh</italic>.] He also draws a supporting inference from R. Jonathan Eibeschutz, <italic>Kereti u-Peleti, Peleti, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 100:4. Rabbi Halberstam, <italic>ibid</italic>., pp. 27f., distinguishes subvisual insects and the like from microscopic creatures found in air and water in declaring that the latter are incapable of independent locomotion. That assumption, however, is factually incorrect. Many microbes are capable of movement in their environment. Many possess a long, flexible, spiral-shaped structure known as a flagellum that pushes the microbe through its surrounding medium. See Varun Shastri, <italic>Microbes</italic> (Delhi, 2006), p. 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn374">55. In an unpublished responsum, Rabbi Falk employs this thesis as a means of reconciling the statements of the Gemara with scientific rejection of spontaneous generation. According to Rabbi Falk, the Gemara, in speaking of worms being generated by the flesh of an animal, is actually referring to the genesis of halakhic recognition of their existence. See <italic>Ve-Anokhi Tola&#x2019;at</italic>, p. 7. That analysis finds support in a comment of Rashi, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 67b. See <italic>supra</italic>, note 27. Cf., however, <italic>infra</italic>, note 57.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn375">56. R. Moshe Viya, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 6, p. 180, reports that this view was endorsed by the late R. Shlomoh Zalman Auerbach and R. Ben-Zion Abba Sha&#x2019;ul as well as by R. Nissim Karelitz and R. Ya&#x2019;akov Fisher. Cf., the diametrically opposing view discussed <italic>infra</italic>, note 57.</ftnote>
<ftnote>If it is true that an organism acquires a halakhic identity only upon becoming visible and that this is the concept expressed in the principle <italic>mineih gavli</italic>, it should then be the case that such organisms are permitted even if found within the digestive organs. If so, the thesis might seem to be contradicted by the Gemara. <italic>Pri Megadim, Siftei Da&#x2019;at</italic> 84:43, states that the Gemara forbids organisms found in the digestive tract, not because it assumes with certainty that they were generated externally and subsequently imbibed by the fish, but because, since that is a distinct possibility, they are forbidden because their status is doubtful. If so, the doubt is really a &#x201C;double doubt&#x201D; or <italic>sefek sefeika,</italic> and hence the organism should be permitted. The first doubt is whether the organisms were spawned outside the fish but imbibed while yet microscopic; the second doubt is whether those organisms were generated by the host itself and hence are entirely permissible. Since the Gemara explicitly prohibits such worms, it should then be concluded that the doubt predicated upon the possibility that external organisms reaching visual size are permitted was not considered precisely because such organisms are forbidden.</ftnote>
<ftnote>However, a <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> is not really present. The reason that a microscopic organism entering the fish is permissible is because it acquires halakhic identity only when becoming visible and hence is halakhically regarded as the product of its host. That is precisely the reason that creatures generated by the host itself are permitted. See <italic>supra</italic>, note 55. If so, the two doubts are <italic>shem ehad</italic>, i.e., really a single halakhic doubt that does not qualify as a <italic>sefek sefeika.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn376">57. Rabbi Halberstam, <italic>Ayin Lo Ra&#x2019;atah</italic>, pp. 23 and 35, maintains that a minuscule creature destined to mature to a recognizable state is forbidden while yet subvisual even according to the authorities who maintain that Halakhah does not take cognizance of subclinical entities or phenomena. Those authorities, he contends, would concede that subvisual parasites that are ingested are forbidden since they will eventually grow to a state in which they are readily perceivable. Hence, he argues, parasites spawned in water are always forbidden regardless of their size at the time of ingestion. Cf., however, <italic>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, VII, no. 122. That is also the view of Rabbi Falk, <italic>Teshuvot Ma&#x1E25;azeh Eliyahu</italic>, no. 91, sec. 6, and of R. Moshe Sternbuch as recorded in a letter appended to <italic>Ve-Anokhi Tola&#x2019;at</italic>, p. 20.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Rabbi Falk&#x2019;s position, as expressed in <italic>Ma&#x1E25;azeh Eliyahu</italic>, can be understood as compatible with his earlier-cited explanation of why worms found in flesh are permissible only by positing the notion that, although the Torah does take cognizance of subvisual creatures that are destined to become visible, their halakhic status is determined by the nature of their subsequent visual state. If so, it does not necessarily follow that subvisual organisms spawned in water but which develop in the flesh of the fish are always forbidden as is contended by Rabbi Halberstam. Rather, if the parasite succeeds in migrating into the flesh while still in a subvisual state, its subsequent development is as a permitted creature nurtured by the flesh of a fish; hence, it was never destined to develop as a forbidden creature. Cf., Rabbi Silver, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 56, pp. 57f. However, if it is capable of migrating only after maturation, as is probably the case, it is forbidden as having already become a perceivable, forbidden creature in the intestines of the fish.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn377">58. Rabbi Halberstam, <italic>Ayin Lo Ra&#x2019;atah</italic>, pp. 27f., cites the comments of the <italic>Brisker Rav</italic>, R. Yitzchak Ze&#x2019;ev Soloveitchik, <italic>&#x1E24;iddushei Rabbeinu ha-Griz al ha-Torah</italic> (n.d.) and <italic>idem, &#x1E24;iddushei Maran Riz ha-Levi al ha-Torah</italic> (Jerusalem, 5723), Exodus 12:2, in support of his position regarding recognition of the sub-visual state. <italic>Mekhilta</italic> 1:6, cited by Rashi, Exodus 12:2, reports that Moses was perplexed with regard to the precise time at which the new moon might be sanctified. God responded by showing him the nascent moon and declaring, &#x201C;This is what you shall see and sanctify.&#x201D; The <italic>Brisker Rav</italic> explains that, in replying to Moses, God announced a <italic>shi&#x2019;ur</italic>, i.e., he specified the minimum arc that must be visible as a requirement for announcing the new month. That exchange, argues Rabbi Halberstam, presumes that Moses knew that the Torah generally does take cognizance of subvisual phenomena but that he was in doubt only with regard to the <italic>shi&#x2019;ur</italic> for sanctification of the new moon.</ftnote>
<ftnote>That deduction is not at all warranted. As the <italic>Brisker Rav</italic> himself remarks, it would have been impossible to sanctify the new moon on the basis of sighting the moon before it becomes visible. Moses&#x2019; doubt was with regard to whether sanctification is contingent solely upon the astronomical phenomenon of the emergence of the new moon, in which case &#x201C;sighting&#x201D; is merely confirmatory evidence of the moon&#x2019;s return to a particular point in its orbit, or whether the new month does not commence until a visible portion of the moon has emerged. When the new moon is sanctified on the basis of actual sighting, resolution of that question is of no consequence. However, when the new moon is sanctified on the basis of astronomical calculations&#x2014;as was the method utilized by Hillel II in establishing a perpetual calendar&#x2014;the question assumes profound significance: Is it the exposure of even a minuscule sliver of the nascent moon that should be calculated or is it the appearance, some six hours later, of a portion of the moon of sufficient size to be perceived on earth that must be calculated? God&#x2019;s reply affirmed the latter to be the case. The <italic>Peirush</italic> (anonymous marginal commentary published in standard editions of the <italic>Mishneh Torah</italic>), Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Kiddush ha-&#x1E24;odesh</italic> 7:1, cites a commentary on <italic>Rosh ha-Shanah</italic> attributed to Rambam indicating that it is the time of possible visual appearance of the moon that must be calculated. That issue is in no way related to the general question of the halakhic status of subclinical phenomena or entities.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Nor can <italic>Mekhilta</italic> be cited as proof that events taking place in a subclinical state are not given cognizance even when their results later become perceivable. The fact that the non-perceived emergence of the nascent moon is of no import even though the moon subsequently becomes visible does not constitute evidence for that thesis. The response, &#x201C;This is what you shall see and sanctify&#x201D; establishes a <italic>shi&#x2019;ur</italic>, namely, that the new month does not begin with the earliest emergence of the moon but commences only when a portion of the moon sufficient for it to be visible to the human eye actually emerges.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn378">59. Cf., R. Ephraim Fishel Siegal, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 61, p. 69. There is actually a third possibility, <italic>viz.</italic>, that &#x201C;the Torah was not given to angels&#x201D; means only that humans cannot be held accountable for what they cannot know, just as man cannot be held culpable in instances of <italic>force majeure</italic>, but, objectively speaking, such phenomena are regarded as existent. That formulation of the principle is quite correctly dismissed by R. Zevi Fried, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 61, p. 49 and by Rabbi Siegal, <italic>ibid</italic>., p. 68.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn379">60. It has been argued that genetic engineering involving the introduction of one or more genes from another citrus fruit into the seed of an <italic>etrog</italic> does not result in a halakhic <italic>murkav</italic> or hybrid because the foreign gene is microscopic at the time that genetic manipulation is undertaken. <italic>Kereti</italic>&#x2019;s thesis raises the possibility that the <italic>etrog</italic> may indeed be <italic>pasul</italic>, or disqualified, if characteristics of the alien fruit become recognizable in the mature <italic>etrog</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn380">61. A difficulty arises from the fact that fermentation of wine as detected by taste buds is evidence of the presence of yeast in the wine. There is no source indicating that wine is permitted only because it is explicitly sanctioned by Scripture. Cf., <italic>&#x1E24;okhmat Adam, Binat Adam</italic>, no. 35. Yeast, however, are incapable of independent locomotion and hence are presumably not members of the prohibited class of &#x201C;swarming creatures.&#x201D; See Claudio Delfini and Joseph V. Formica, <italic>Wine Microbiology: Science and Technology</italic> (New York, 2001), p. 49.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn381">62. Cf., however, <italic>&#x1E24;avvat Da&#x2019;at</italic> 81:1, who maintains that there is no prohibition of <italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic> with regard to forbidden fish. See, however, <italic>Tosafot</italic>, <italic>Bekhorot</italic> 7b, s.v. <italic>rov dagim,</italic> who apparently espouse a contradictory view. See also Malbim on Leviticus 11:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn382">63. Rabbi Viya, <italic>Bedikat ha-Mazon,</italic> I, <italic>sha&#x2019;ar sheni</italic>, chap. 3, note 22, rebuts that argument by citing <italic>&#x1E24;avvat Da&#x2019;at</italic> 81:2 who asserts that a fully-developed entity is not prohibited as <italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic>. However, <italic>&#x1E24;avvat Da&#x2019;at</italic> agrees that, by virtue of an entirely different scriptural derivation, identity as a member of a species is acquired by virtue of the species identity of the progenitor. If so, an organism juridically regarded as having been generated by a non-kosher creature should also acquire identity as a member of the species of its progenitor.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn383">64. Cf., <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 17:13. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> asserts that worms that are not <italic>piresh</italic> are permissible because they are generated by a foodstuff whose identity they acquire. That view is entirely consistent with the position of R. Hai Ga&#x2019;on cited <italic>supra</italic>, note 27. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, however, further declares that a worm that is not <italic>piresh</italic> is permissible only if it acquires the identity of a permissible foodstuff as evidenced by the fact that worms found in a living animal are not forbidden as <italic>ever min ha-&#x1E25;ai</italic>. Hence, according to <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, a worm generated by a non-kosher organism would always be treated as <italic>piresh</italic>.</ftnote>

For a discussion of those questions see chapter seven of this volume, pp. 222-228. In addition to possible resolutions of the issue of spontaneous generation discussed in that article R. David Sinzheim, noted for his role as president of the Sanhedrin convened by Napoleon, <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Ani, ma&#x2019;amar sheva &#x1E25;akirot,</italic> p. 111a, offers a rather implausible explanation of the concept &#x201C;<italic>heinu reviteih&#x201D;</italic> or <italic>&#x201C;mineih gavli</italic>&#x201D; employed by the Gemara with regard to organisms generated in stagnant water or in the flesh of animals and fish. <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Ani</italic> suggests that those organisms are regarded as integral parts of their hosts because they cannot be nurtured in any other medium and hence members of those particular species are never found elsewhere. For that reason, he claims, worms found in cheese and fruit, for example, are readily recognized as different species.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn390">71. See, however, R. Isaac Lampronti, <italic>Pa&#x1E25;ad Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak, erekh &#x1E93;eidah</italic>, with regard to the issue of <italic>kinim</italic>.</ftnote>

Rabbi Revach suggests that those organisms are the <italic>darni</italic> described by the Sages and are permissible. Indeed, Rabbi Revach, <italic>ibid</italic>., no. 56, p. 52, permits white organisms resembling grains of rice found in the flesh of &#x201C;all species of sole&#x201D; as conforming to the criteria for assuming that they are spontaneously generated by the fish.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn393">74. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 14:3, asserts that the doubt expressed by the Gemara is only with regard to a worm that passes from one date to a second date that is in close proximity to the first. If, however, the second date is moved, the second date can no longer be regarded as the original, and hence natural, habitat of the worm. Rabbi Viya, <italic>op. cit.,</italic> note 22, seems to suggest that, since the parasite ingested with krill will never return to its original <italic>situ</italic>, it must certainly be regarded as <italic>piresh</italic>, or as having removed itself from its place of origin. Presumably, that argument is based upon the fact that the krill is digested by its host and hence the parasite is &#x201C;removed&#x201D; from its original <italic>situ</italic>. However, that phenomenon certainly does not seem to constitute <italic>piresh</italic> on the part of the parasite. See <italic>infra</italic>, note 75.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn394">75. That argument is also advanced by Rabbi Halberstam, <italic>Ve-Anokhi Tola&#x2019;at</italic>, pp. 10f. Rabbi Viya, <italic>loc. cit.</italic>, finds reason to distinguish this case from that of a worm passing from one fruit to another. Unlike the worm which leaves its original habitat, the parasite does not initiate the change of <italic>situ</italic> but is merely within a marine creature swallowed by a larger fish. Hence the parasite has not separated itself from its natural habitat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn395">76. Although <italic>Shevet ha-Levi</italic> does not cite a source, the position that an organism that passes from one species of fruit to another is prohibited as a matter of certainty was formulated by an early-day authority, R. Chaim ben Yitzchak, <italic>Teshuvot Or Zaru&#x2019;a,</italic> no. 26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn396">77. R. Ben-Zion Woszner, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 6, p. 170, suggests that the opposite is the case, i.e., that an organism that has been swallowed together with water by a fish is not to be considered as separated from its original <italic>situ</italic>. Rabbi Woszner compares that situation to that of an aquatic organism that comes to rest upon a foodstuff within the same water. An organism generated in stagnant water is permitted because it is deemed to have been generated by the water. That organism is regarded by <italic>Pri Megadim, Mishbe&#x1E93;ot Zahav</italic> 84:5, as possibly permissible because it may be deemed not to have been separated from its original habitat. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 14:3, similarly regards an aquatic organism arising in stagnant water that comes to rest upon a fish within the same body of water as not having been &#x201C;separated&#x201D; from its original aquatic habitat.</ftnote>
<ftnote>This writer finds the comparison elusive. The situations considered by <italic>Pri Megadim</italic> and <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> are ones in which the aquatic organism remains immersed in its original habitat, <italic>viz.,</italic> in water; a parasite migrating from one fish to another is not in its original habitat just as a worm that passes from one date to another is no longer in its original habitat. Indeed, <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> explicitly states that an organism coming to rest upon a fish becomes forbidden once the fish is removed from the water.</ftnote>

<title><italic>Chapter 9</italic> Is the Milk We Drink Kosher?</title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>He who commanded and admonished regarding treifah commanded us to rely on rov.</italic></p>
<p align="blockquote">TESHUVOT &#x1E24;ATAM SOFER, ORA&#x1E24; &#x1E24;AYYIM, no. 83</p>
<h1>I. <italic>The Problem</italic></h1>
<p>The Gemara, <italic>Bekhorot</italic> 6b, establishes that it is forbidden to drink the milk of a non-kosher animal. That prohibition applies not only to the milk of members of non-kosher species but also to the milk of an animal of a kosher species that has become a <italic>treifah</italic>, i.e., an animal that has either suffered a perforation of a particular organ or that manifests any one of a number of anatomical anomalies. The perforation and anomalies that render an animal a <italic>treifah</italic> are enumerated by the Gemara, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 42a, and catalogued by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot She&#x1E25;itah</italic> 10:9.</p>
<p>Determining with perfect certainty that any particular animal is not a <italic>treifah</italic> would require a laborious and time-consuming post-mortem examination. Indeed, since perforation of the major portion of the trachea or even a minute hole in the esophagus renders an animal a <italic>treifah</italic>, it is impossible to make an absolute determination that the animal is not a <italic>treifah</italic> because, in an otherwise kosher animal, the perforation may be masked by the slaughterer&#x2019;s incision. The Gemara, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 11a, determines that no such anatomical examination is necessary. Instead, the Gemara declares that the rabbinic rendition of the verse &#x201C;according to the majority to determine&#x201D; (Exodus 23:2) serves to establish the principle of <italic>rov</italic>, or &#x201C;majority.&#x201D; The principle of <italic>rov</italic> establishes that, given the existence of a major set and of a minor set, each set containing entities of a single species but of differing halakhic status, one may assume that any unexamined entity within that species is a member of the major set. Applied to the <italic>kashrut</italic> status of any unexamined animal, the principle of <italic>rov</italic> serves to establish that the animal in question is not a <italic>treifah</italic>: The majority of animals are not <italic>treifot</italic> and hence constitute the major set. Therefore, despite the existence of a minor set comprised of animals that are <italic>treifot</italic>, any slaughtered animal must be assumed to belong to the major set of non-<italic>treifah</italic> animals. Hence the meat of an unexamined animal&#x2014;and its milk while the animal is yet alive&#x2014;may be consumed by reason of reliance upon the principle of <italic>rov</italic>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite the principle of <italic>rov</italic>, by virtue of rabbinic decree, one is required to examine for the presence of any factor that might render the animal or foodstuff impermissible if the magnitude of the minor set rises to the level of a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic>, i.e., &#x201C;a frequently encountered minority.&#x201D; Hence, since adhesions symptomatic of an underlying perforation (or a degeneration of tissue that would culminate in a perforation) are quite common, rabbinic law decrees that the lungs of slaughtered animals must be examined in order to confirm the absence of disqualifying adhesions.<sup><xref rid="fn409">1</xref></sup> Similarly, flour, rice and fruit or the like need not ordinarily be examined for insect infestation since the majority of such foods are free of insects. However, if the percentage of such foodstuff known to be infested constitutes a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic> all samples of that species must be examined for insects.</p>
<p>The definition of a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic> is a matter of significant controversy.<sup><xref rid="fn410">2</xref></sup> An early-day authority, <italic>Teshuvot Rivash</italic>, no. 131, defines <italic>mi&#x2019;ut hama&#x1E93;ui</italic> as &#x201C;close&#x201D; to fifty percent.<sup><xref rid="fn411">3</xref></sup> At the other extreme, some contemporary authorities regard even five percent,<sup><xref rid="fn412">4</xref></sup> or possibly four percent,<sup><xref rid="fn413">5</xref></sup> as &#x201C;a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic>.&#x201D; The most widely cited position is that of R. Jacob of Karlin, <italic>Teshuvot Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 17. <italic>Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> adduces talmudic evidence suggesting that examination is required in circumstances in which the incidence of concern is higher than ten percent.<sup><xref rid="fn414">6</xref></sup> Since there is no evidence that a lower incidence was also regarded as a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic> triggering a requirement for examination, <italic>Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> regards ten percent as the threshold level of <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn415">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, were it to be established that a certain anomaly rendering an animal a <italic>treifah</italic> is prevalent in a particular locale to a degree greater than the threshold level of a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic>, it would be necessary to examine every suspect animal in order to establish the absence of that anomaly. For example, some years ago, in Israel, Newcastle&#x2019;s disease became widespread among poultry with the result that many rabbinic authorities required examination of fowl for the presence of anomalies caused by that disease.<sup><xref rid="fn416">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rule requiring examination for a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic> is limited to situations in which such examination is feasible. Thus, if the lungs are lost or misplaced before the requisite examination has been carried out the meat of the animal may nevertheless be eaten, at least in situations in which declaring the animal a <italic>treifah</italic> would result in a significant financial loss, in reliance upon the principle that the animal may be judged to be a member of the major set of non-<italic>treifot</italic>. It is precisely because examination of the lungs of a living animal is impossible that it is permissible to drink the milk of an unexamined animal of a kosher species.<sup><xref rid="fn417">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In days gone by, when milk for home consumption was obtained from a single cow or from a handful of cows, the applicability of the principle of <italic>rov</italic> was obvious. Even though, statistically, some animals certainly were <italic>treifot</italic>, there was no reason not to apply the principle of <italic>rov</italic> to the animal milked and hence no reason to challenge the <italic>kashrut</italic> of the milk produced by the cow. In the modern age, commercial dairies collect milk from, literally, hundreds of cows. Milk from all those cows is combined, pasteurized and then bottled. Statistically, since a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic> of dairy cows are indeed <italic>treifot</italic>, it is virtually certain that milk bottled in a dairy contains an admixture of non-kosher milk. The percentage of non-kosher milk processed in a dairy is proportionate to the percentage of non-kosher cows in the dairy herd or herds from which the milk is collected. Thus, if, for example, milk in a specific dairy is collected from one hundred cows and if, statistically, the minority of cows known to be <italic>treifot</italic> is ten percent, ten of those cows may be presumed to be <italic>treifot</italic> and the milk produced by those cows is likewise non-kosher.<sup><xref rid="fn418">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The probability that at least two of the cows are <italic>treifot</italic> is far greater than the probability that the percent of <italic>treifot</italic> in the sample is as great as the percent of <italic>treifot</italic> among all cows.<sup><xref rid="fn419">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hence, since the milk of all cows in the herd is combined in the processing procedure with the result that non-kosher milk is diffused proportionately in kosher milk, ten percent of the milk in any milk container is non-kosher. Ten percent is much higher than the sixty to one ratio of kosher to non-kosher ingredients required for nullification of a non-kosher foodstuff. Indeed, since forbidden foodstuffs present in concentration greater than one in sixty, or 1.67 percent, are not subject to nullification, were the percentage of <italic>treifot</italic> determined to be as low as two percent the identical problem would exist.</p>
<p>The problem was first presented in print by R. Gavriel Yehudah Illowitz in a contribution to a Torah journal published by the Karlin-Stolin community, <italic>Kove&#x1E93; Bet Aharon ve-Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, (no. 104), vol. 14, no. 2 (Tevet 5763) and republished anonymously in an Israeli journal published in Kiryat Sanz, <italic>Ha-Be&#x2019;er</italic> (no. 21-22), vol. 4, no. 3-4 (Adar-Nisan 5763). A series of responses, each seeking to establish the permissibility of the milk in question, was published in <italic>Kove&#x1E93; Bet Aharon ve-Yisra&#x2019;el</italic> (no. 106), vol. 18, no. 4 (Nisan-Iyar 5763) and (no. 108), vol. 18, no. 6 (Av-Elul 5763) as well as in <italic>Ha-Be&#x2019;er</italic> (no. 21-22), vol. 4, no. 3-4 (Nisan 5763), (no. 23) vol. 5, no. 1 (Tishri 5764), and (no. 24) vol. 5, no. 2 (Adar 5764). A rejoinder by Rabbi Illowitz affirming his earlier negative view was published in <italic>Kove&#x1E93; Bet Aharon ve-Yisra&#x2019;el</italic> (no. 107), vol. 18, no. 5 (Sivan-Tammuz 5763). An additional response in support of the negative view authored by R. Judah Moskowitz appeared in <italic>Ha-Be&#x2019;er</italic> (no. 23), vol. 5, no. 1 (Tishri 5764). The authors of the articles expressing a permissive view are R. Zalman Nehemiah Goldberg, R. Asher Weiss, R. Levi Yitzchak Halperin, R. Menasheh Klein, R. Asher Ze&#x2019;ev Schreiber, R. Gavriel Yudewitz and R. Yosef Meir Feldman. A similar permissive view is also expressed by R. Eliyahu Schlesinger, <italic>Bet Hillel</italic> (no. 15), vol. 4, no. 3 (Av 5763) and R. Dov Landau, <italic>Be-Netiv ha-&#x1E24;alav</italic>, I, 5963.</p>
<h1>II. <italic>Does Halakhah Take Cognizance of Minor Sets?</italic></h1>
<p>The crucial issue in determining the <italic>kashrut</italic> status of commercially produced milk is whether the principle of <italic>rov</italic> serves to exclude any halakhic consideration of the existence of the minor set or whether the existence of the minor set is acknowledged but nevertheless disregarded as a matter of procedure. If the former is the case, the statistical probability of the presence of a minor set large enough to render nullification impossible need not be considered. If the latter is true, it follows that, when it is known that, statistically, significant representation of the minor set must occur, nullification is rendered impossible.</p>
<h2>A. <italic>The Sources</italic></h2>
<h3>1. Teshuvot Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov</h3>
<p>In support of his argument that statistical probability can serve to render the principle of nullification nugatory Rabbi Illowitz cites a comment of <italic>Teshuvot Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 16. <italic>Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> formulates the rather novel thesis that, although by talmudic times a significant minority of animals were <italic>treifot</italic>, in earlier times, i.e., during the Temple period, internal <italic>treifot</italic> were so extremely rare as to be virtually nonexistent. In establishing the validity of that assertion <italic>Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> cites a statement of the Mishnah, <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;im</italic> 64a. The Mishnah records that, in addition to sprinkling the blood of each paschal offering on the altar, R. Judah maintains that, after the slaughter of all individual sacrifices was completed, the priest filled a container with blood collected from the floor of the Temple and poured it upon the altar. The Gemara, <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;im</italic> 65a, explains that R. Judah was concerned that, due to the pressure of the large number of paschal sacrifices, a priest might have inadvertently failed to sprinkle the blood of one or more of those animals. Since the pooled blood on the ground came from each of the sacrificed animals, pouring from a utensil in which blood from all paschal sacrifices had been mingled served to assure that some portion of the blood of each sacrificial animal reached the altar. <italic>Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> questions the efficacy of that procedure: It is forbidden to sprinkle the blood of a <italic>treifah</italic> on the altar. Contrary to the majority view, R. Judah himself maintains that nullification is possible only through admixture with an entirely different substance; thus, for R. Judah, blood cannot be nullified even by admixture with copious quantities of other blood. Accordingly, objects <italic>Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>, if, in actuality, even one of the sacrificed animals was a <italic>treifah</italic>, the expedient of pouring a cup of commingled blood should not have been permitted because of the prohibition against sprinkling the forbidden blood of a <italic>treifah</italic>. Therefore, deduces <italic>Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>, in antiquity, there must have been no cause to fear that even a minority of the animals were <italic>treifot</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn420">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Illowitz notes that <italic>Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> himself recognized that the blood of the paschal sacrifices was sprinkled on the altar before examination of the lungs. Accordingly, he argues, if the import of the principle &#x201C;the majority of animals are kosher&#x201D;is that the statistical incidence of the minority need not be a matter of concern, <italic>Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>&#x2019;s argument is entirely lacking in cogency: The statistical occurrence of <italic>treifot</italic> may have been no less than in later times, but, nevertheless, the principle serves to determine that each and every animal in question is a member of the major set. Accordingly, deduces Rabbi Illowitz, <italic>Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> must have assumed as a matter of course that the statistical probability of the presence of a member of the minor set of <italic>treifot</italic> cannot be ignored. Only if that unstated premise is accepted, argues Rabbi Illowitz, does <italic>Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>&#x2019;s argument acquire cogency.</p>
<p>In his contribution to the Tishri 5764 issue of <italic>Ha-Be&#x2019;er</italic>, R. Asher Ze&#x2019;ev Schreiber deftly refutes that argument. It is indeed the case that the sacrificial blood was sprinkled before the animal was incised. But the cup of blood to which the Gemara refers was collected only after the sacrifice of all the paschal offerings was complete. By that time examination of the lungs had certainly been carried out. According to R. Judah, had even a single animal been found to be a <italic>treifah</italic>, the expedient of sprinkling the commingled blood of all the sacrificed animals would not have been available. Accordingly, <italic>Mishkenot Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>&#x2019;s deduction that <italic>treifot</italic> were so rare that it was possible to slaughter so many animals without discovering a single <italic>treifah</italic> is not based upon a halakhic assumption that the statistical probability of the occurrence of a <italic>treifah</italic> cannot be ignored but upon actual empirical observation that there were no <italic>treifot</italic>.</p>
<h3>2. Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</h3>
<p>There is, however, another, more compelling source that does serve to support the thesis that application of the principle of <italic>rov</italic> entails ignoring completely the statistical likelihood of the presence of a member of the minor set. R. Levi Yitzchak Halperin cites a ruling of <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> from which it is readily deduced that, in sanctioning the eating of cheese, the statistical probability that a portion of the milk too great to be nullified came from a <italic>treifah</italic> is to be disregarded. <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 81:2, rules that cheese made from milk of an animal later found to be a <italic>treifah</italic> is non-kosher. <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> then adds the comment that, if the cheese was made from milk collected from the entire herd, the milk is permissible provided that the herd consisted of at least sixty kosher cows. The grounds for that ruling are obvious: the non-kosher milk used in production of the cheese in question is nullified in sixty parts of kosher milk. However, nullification in an admixture containing a ratio of sixty to one is cogent only if there is a halakhic presumption that each of the sixty live cows is a non-<italic>treifah</italic>. Since examination for internal <italic>treifot</italic> is not possible while the cow is yet alive, the rule formulated by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> flows from the halakhic presumption that, unless shown to be otherwise, each animal for which a determination is sought is a member of the <italic>rov</italic>, or major set of animals that are kosher. Yet the requirement for examination of lungs of slaughtered animals for the absence of adhesions because of the presence of a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic>, i.e., a significant minority of animals that are <italic>treifot</italic>, reflects recognition that, statistically, there must be some non-kosher animals in a herd of sixty dairy cows. Since milk collected from one of those cows is known to be non-kosher, the cheese made from the combined milk of all sixty-one cows is kosher only if all of the remaining cows are non-<italic>treifot</italic>. However, if even a single additional cow in the herd is a <italic>treifah</italic>, not to speak of a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic> of <italic>treifot</italic>, the milk of the <italic>treifah</italic> could not have been nullified by virtue of admixture with the requisite quantity of kosher milk and hence the cheese made from such milk should be forbidden. <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>&#x2019;s ruling, then, clearly reflects the notion that the principle declaring that &#x201C;the majority of animals are kosher&#x201D; is applied to each animal individually and statistical exceptions are to be disregarded. If the principle is applied to each animal individually, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>&#x2019;s ruling extends equally to a herd of sixty, six hundred or six thousand cows and even the extremely high statistical probability of the presence of a significant quantity of milk derived from non-kosher cows is to be ignored.</p>
<h3>3. Tevu&#x2019;at Shor</h3>
<p>The same principle is also reflected in a later source, <italic>Tevu&#x2019;at Shor</italic> 1:26. <italic>Tevu&#x2019;at Shor&#x2019;s</italic> discussion focuses upon the hypothetical case of a slaughterer who, after a period of service, was found to be ignorant of the halakhic provisions governing examination of lungs. <italic>Tevu&#x2019;at Shor</italic> compares the case to a situation in which the lung is lost before examination and rules that any already slaughtered meat and the utensils in which it was cooked are permissible.<sup><xref rid="fn421">13</xref></sup> <italic>Tevu&#x2019;at Shor</italic> adds the further comment:</p>
<p align="blockquote">There is no reason to say [that] since, in the present situation, [the slaughterer] examined a superfluity of animals, it is almost certain that there were [some] <italic>treifot</italic> among them in which case [this situation] is not comparable to [that] of a lost lung and therefore the utensils should be deemed non-kosher and similarly meat of many animals should not be given to a single person to eat, [nevertheless,] it seems to me that one need not be concerned, just as we eat even from each of many animals in a herd and similarly we cook milk even from each of the animals in pots and we are not concerned.</p>
<p>The thrust of that comment is that, in relying upon the principle of <italic>rov</italic>, we are not at all concerned with the fact that, statistically, at least some of the animals in a large herd must be <italic>treifot</italic>. The fact that, empirically, it is &#x201C;close to certain&#x201D; that some of those animals are not kosher is halakhically irrelevant.<sup><xref rid="fn422">14</xref></sup></p>
<h3>4. <italic>The Status of a Minor Set with Regard to Milk</italic></h3>
<p>Rabbi Halperin endeavors to show that, with regard to resolution of doubt, the status of milk is somewhat different from that of meat. <italic>Hagahot Asheri, Bei&#x1E93;ah</italic> 4:15, rules that, in areas is which the majority of animals are found to be non-kosher, it is forbidden to slaughter on <italic>Yom Tov</italic>. Slaughtering, like cooking, is permitted only for the purpose of preparing meat for consumption on <italic>Yom Tov</italic>. When the majority of animals are kosher, the presumption with regard to each act of slaughter is that it is undertaken for the purpose of preparing food to be eaten on <italic>Yom Tov</italic>. But in cases in which the majority of animals will not be fit for consumption by Jews, the act of slaughter cannot be regarded as designed to make meat available for eating. Nevertheless, no authority rules that it is forbidden to drink milk in a locale in which a majority of animals are found to be non-kosher. Rabbi Halperin suggests that milk has a <italic>&#x1E25;ezkat hetter</italic>, i.e., milk is presumptively permissible unless there is evidence to the contrary, whereas the meat of a living animal is certainly forbidden while the animal is yet alive.<sup><xref rid="fn423">15</xref></sup> Rabbi Halperin argues that the <italic>&#x1E25;ezkat hetter</italic> is sufficient to overcome the statistical probability of the presence of a <italic>treifah</italic>.</p>
<p>In his rejoinder published in <italic>Kove&#x1E93; Bet Aharon ve-Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, vol. 18, no. 4, Rabbi Illowitz quite cogently points out that a <italic>&#x1E25;ezkat hetter</italic> is of no avail when it is known with certainty that the majority of animals are <italic>treifot</italic> and that, moreover, since the normative position is that a <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic> with regard to a particular prohibition, e.g., the limbs or organs of a living animal, does not create a <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic> with regard to any other prohibition, the meat should similarly be prohibited.</p>
<p>The apparent paradox reflected in permitting the milk of animals that may not be slaughtered on <italic>Yom Tov</italic> is readily resolvable. The ruling of <italic>Hagahot Asheri</italic> regarding slaughter of animals on <italic>Yom Tov</italic> is limited by <italic>Sha&#x2019;agat Aryeh</italic>, no. 64, to cases in which the majority of animals are not actually <italic>treifot</italic> but are afflicted with anomalies which render the animal <italic>treifah</italic> because of our inability to resolve matters of halakhic doubt or because of stringencies imposed to prevent actual transgression. Thus, in the situation described by <italic>Hagahot Asheri</italic>, the milk is permitted because there is no actual majority of non-kosher animals and also because of a &#x201C;double doubt,&#x201D; <italic>viz.</italic>, perhaps the animal from which the milk is derived has no anomaly and, if the animal does suffer from an anomaly, perhaps the anomaly does not render it an actual <italic>treifah</italic>. However, with regard to slaughtering the animal on <italic>Yom Tov</italic>, since the meat will not actually be eaten, its slaughter is forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn424">16</xref></sup></p>
<h3>5. &#x1E24;atam Sofer</h3>
<p>The halakhic stance with regard to ignoring the presence of a minor set is stated in even more explicit terms by R. Moses Sofer, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer, Even ha-Ezer</italic>, I, no. 5. The rules of evidence provide that a single witness has no credibility to testify counter to a <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic>. Thus, for example, the testimony of a single witness to the effect that a husband has died cannot, in and of itself, establish the wife&#x2019;s capacity to contract a second marriage. A <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic> of this nature is the presumption that a halakhic status has not changed unless there is evidence to that effect; the testimony of a single witness does not constitute sufficiently strong countervailing evidence to overcome the presumption established by a <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic>.</p>
<p>There is another procedural rule to the effect that a <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic> can be overcome on the basis of a countervailing <italic>rov</italic>. If so, argue R. Ezekiel Landau, <italic>Teshuvot Noda bi-Yehudah, Mahadura Kamma, Even ha-Ezer</italic>, no. 69, and <italic>Pnei Yehoshu&#x2019;a, Kiddushin</italic> 63b, since <italic>rov</italic> is assigned greater weight than <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic> and <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic> is accorded greater weight than a single witness, it should follow that <italic>rov</italic> should be given greater weight than a single witness. Or, to express the matter somewhat differently, just as a single witness has no credibility in the presence of a <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic>, he should, <italic>a fortiori</italic>, not have credibility to testify contrary to a <italic>rov</italic>. Yet a single witness does have standing to testify that he recognizes one piece of meat among nine other pieces of meat as being kosher even when it is known that nine other pieces of meat are definitely non-kosher. Similarly, a slaughterer has credibility to identify one animal as kosher despite the fact that the majority of animals in the slaughterhouse are non-kosher. In effect, a single witness can be heard to testify that an unknown entity is not to be assigned to the major set.</p>
<p><italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> resolves the problem by distinguishing between application of the principle of <italic>rov</italic> in the sense of a majority in a situation in which there is a known antithetical minority and application of the principle of <italic>rov</italic> in a situation in which there is no identifiable minority. The testimony of a single witness in contradiction to application of the principle of <italic>rov</italic>, he asserts, is accepted only when the presence of a minority is established and known with certainty. In such a situation the witness is simply identifying one entity as a member of the minor set whose existence has already been established. However, the type of <italic>rov</italic> that prevails over a <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic> is a <italic>rov</italic> with no known exceptions, e.g., the majority of animals are kosher. That <italic>rov</italic>, properly understood, establishes that the majority of unexamined animals are kosher. Animals known to be non-kosher are not part of the quandary and hence are excluded from the <italic>rov</italic>. That type of <italic>rov</italic> carries greater weight than a <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic> and a single witness would have no credibility to contradict a <italic>rov</italic> of that nature because of the complete absence of a known minor set. Hence, concludes <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, &#x201C;it is possible that, at present, <italic>there is no single treifah in the world other than those known to us</italic>.&#x201D; <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> quite obviously accepts the proposition that, with regard to unknown entities, Halakhah completely disregards the statistical probability of the existence of a minor set.</p>
<h2>B. <italic>The Theoretical Basis</italic></h2>
<p>The heretofore cited sources are culled from statements of latter-day authorities and demonstrate that, in applying the principle of <italic>rov</italic>, those authorities treat the minor set as devoid of members. However, an unequivocal logical reason supporting the position that the probability of existence of a minor set is to be entirely ignored for purposes of halakhic determinations remains to be demonstrated.</p>
<p>On first analysis it would seem that such a conclusion follows only on the basis of recognition that application of two rather different, but complementary, principles of <italic>rov</italic> yield that result. As earlier indicated, the principle that &#x201C;the majority of animals are kosher&#x201D; renders it permissible to partake of meat even though it is impossible to examine the animal for perforation of the trachea and the esophagus. The Torah, in effect, bids us to rely upon the presumption that the animal before us is one of the majority of animals that is not a <italic>treifah</italic>. That <italic>rov</italic> applies to all the animals of the world or, at the minimum, to all the animals of the locale from which the slaughtered animal has been culled. Of course, on the basis of past observation, one can take notice of the fact that <italic>treifot</italic> have existed in the past and hence unidentified <italic>treifot</italic> are quite likely to exist at the present. That <italic>rov</italic> is termed a &#x201C;<italic>rubba de-leta kamman</italic> &#x2013; a <italic>rov</italic> that is not present before us,&#x201D; i.e., a <italic>rov</italic> unaccompanied by a parallel antithetical minor set containing identifiable members.</p>
<p>There is, however, another entirely distinguishable principle of <italic>rov</italic> that is applied when the question is whether a given entity became detached from a major set composed of identifiable members or from a corresponding minor set also composed of identifiable members. Since all members of those two sets were identifiable at least at one time, that <italic>rov</italic> is known as a &#x201C;<italic>rubba de-ita kamman</italic>&#x2014;a <italic>rov</italic> that is present before us.&#x201D; The latter principle of <italic>rov</italic> is derived directly from the biblical phrase &#x201C;according to the majority to determine&#x201D; (Exodus 23:2). The paradigmatic example is meat found in the street in a city having nine kosher butcher stores and one non-kosher establishment. The meat that has been found has clearly become separated from its original source. In that situation there is a major set comprised of nine members and a minor set having a single member. Application of the principle of <italic>rov</italic> yields the determination that the meat in question has become separated from a member of the major class and hence the meat is ruled to be kosher. The talmudic formulation of that principle is &#x201C;<italic>Kol de-parish me-rubba parish</italic>&#x2014;All that are separated are separated from the majority.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Once it is known that there exists a <italic>rubba de-leta kamman</italic> establishing that the majority of all animals are not <italic>treifot</italic>, each and every animal presented for a determination of its status must be regarded as non-<italic>treifah</italic> despite the statistical probability that some animals are <italic>treifot</italic>. The universe does indeed include both <italic>treifot</italic> and non-<italic>treifot</italic>. But any animal whose status is subject to question must be judged to have become detached from the major set rather than from the minor set. Thus, the empirical existence of the minor set is of no halakhic import, statistical reality notwithstanding.<sup><xref rid="fn425">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>There remains, however, a further problem. The principle of <italic>kol deparish</italic> does not apply to the case of a person living in a city having nine kosher meat establishments and one non-kosher store who has purchased meat in a store but cannot remember whether the establishment he patronized sold kosher or non-kosher meat. The principle of <italic>rov</italic> applies only when doubt arises after the meat in question has become &#x201C;separated&#x201D; or detached from its point of origin; however, if the doubt arises while the subject of doubt is <italic>kavu&#x2019;a</italic>, i.e., at its point of origin, rather than subsequent to separation, the principle of <italic>rov</italic> does not apply. How, then, can <italic>kol deparish</italic> be applied in situations in which a purchaser acquires an animal by visiting a herd and selecting the animal or animals he desires? <italic>Teshuvot R. Akiva Eger</italic>, <italic>Mahadura Tinyana</italic>, no. 103, sec. 12, resolves that problem by formulating a hypothesis to the effect that a situation of <italic>kavu&#x2019;a</italic> constitutes an exception to the principle of <italic>rov</italic> only if the existence of a non-kosher animal at the point of origin is known with certainty; otherwise, the principle of <italic>rov</italic> continues to govern.</p>
<p>However, earlier, in section 11 of the same responsum, R. Akiva Eger raises an even more perplexing issue. The principle of <italic>kol de-parish</italic>, he asserts, can be applied to a calf born after the mother has been acquired by the purchaser. The status of the calf as a <italic>treifah</italic> or as a non-<italic>treifah</italic> is questionable from the very moment that the calf comes into existence; that question arises at the calf&#x2019;s point of origin, i.e., at the moment of birth or even earlier, not upon separation from other members of a set.</p>
<p>That observation should necessarily lead to one of two conclusions:</p>
<p>1) The principle of <italic>kol de-parish</italic> is indeed not applicable to large herds of dairy cows calved and raised by a single dairyman and hence the statistical incidence of <italic>treifot</italic> must be taken into consideration; or 2) even without the principle of <italic>kol de-parish</italic>, the principle of <italic>rubba de-leta kamman</italic> serves, in and of itself, to establish that each and every animal of doubtful status is adjudicated to be a member of the majority and the statistical probability of the presence of at least some members of the minority must be ignored.</p>
<h1>III. <italic>Conclusion</italic></h1>
<p>The application of the principle of <italic>rov</italic> is a halakhic principle rather than an empirical determination. Rabbi Menasheh Klein, in his contribution to the Nisan 5768 issue of <italic>Ha-Be&#x2019;er</italic>, probably overstates the case in declaring, &#x201C;But, in truth, the law of <italic>rov</italic> is a positive commandment&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn426">18</xref></sup> but he is entirely correct in stating that with regard to any particular animal &#x201C;we are commanded&#x201D; to rule in accordance with <italic>rov</italic>. Those comments echo the declaration of R. Moses Sofer, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 83: &#x201C;For He who commanded and prohibited the <italic>treifah</italic> commanded us to rely upon <italic>rov</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Writing with regard to an entirely different subject, R. Moshe Feinstein, <italic>Dibberot Mosheh</italic>, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic>, addenda, responsum no. 1, sec. 12,<sup><xref rid="fn427">19</xref></sup> declares unequivocally that, in applying the principle of <italic>kol de-parish</italic>, each entity is to be regarded as a member of the major set &#x201C;and there is not even one&#x201D; that is a member of the minor set with the result that &#x201C;<italic>sevarot bnei adam</italic>,&#x201D; i.e., presumptions of the human intellect, are to be totally ignored. Rabbi Feinstein concludes with the sharp statement: &#x201C;He who does not wish to rely upon &#x2026; the law of <italic>parish me-rubba</italic> because of reasons of human intellect is as if he disputes the Torah, Heaven forfend.&#x201D;</p>

The Mishnah, <italic>Gittin</italic> 31a, indicates that, at certain times of the year, wine that is to be designated as <italic>terumah</italic> must be examined to determine that it has not become vinegar and therefore disqualified for designation as <italic>terumah</italic> for wine. The Gemara, <italic>Bava Batra</italic> 93b, declares that a person who buys a quantity of casks of wine must accept among those casks wine that has spoiled and become vinegar provided that the vinegar is not more than ten percent of the entire quantity.

<p align="blockquote"><italic>Had Boaz known that the Holy One, blessed be He, would write of him &#x201C;and he extended parched corn to her&#x201D; (Ruth 2:14), he would have given her fattened calves.</italic></p>
<p align="blockquote">RUTH RABBAH 5:6</p>
<h1>I. <italic>Humane Treatment</italic></h1>
<p>Animal rights groups have long protested the condition under which animals and poultry are raised for commercial markets. Methods employed in raising calves for veal have also been an ongoing focus of attention. Animal rights groups charge that the calves are raised in inhumane conditions. Not surprisingly, those contentions have been denied by the meat industry. Nevertheless, the most successful animal rights boycott in the United States began more than twenty years ago with publicization of photographs of formula-fed veal calves tethered in tiny crates in which they were virtually immobilized. As a result, consumption of veal plummeted from an average of four pounds a year per person to approximately half a pound per year. A recent feature article in the Dining section of the <italic>New York Times</italic><sup><xref rid="fn428">1</xref></sup> reports the growth of a yet nascent movement within the industry to raise pastured calves that are suckled and later fed grass and grain. Meat derived from such calves is not only &#x201C;certified humane&#x201D; but is reportedly more tender and more flavorful than formula-fed veal.</p>
<p>The meat of calves raised on grass or grain is rosy or pink in color. Formula-fed veal, in contrast, is prized for its white color which is the result of a lack of iron. R. Moshe Feinstein, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, IV, no. 92, addresses the propriety of inhumane treatment of animals in order to achieve that purpose.</p>
<p>Although wantonly causing pain to animals is forbidden, the prohibition against causing pain to animals is generally regarded as inapplicable in situations in which there is human benefit, at least when the benefit is substantial in nature.<sup><xref rid="fn429">2</xref></sup> Nevertheless, asserts <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, infliction of pain upon animals can be sanctioned only for a recognized and legitimate human benefit. Even when normatively permitted, avoidance of causing pain to animals is regarded as an act of piety,<sup><xref rid="fn430">3</xref></sup> at least in most circumstances.<sup><xref rid="fn431">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, although giving vent to rage or anger has a calming effect, Jewish law does not recognize that need as legitimizing either destruction of property, even one&#x2019;s own, or infliction of pain upon animals.<sup><xref rid="fn432">5</xref></sup> <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> asserts that such an act, when not performed to advance a legitimate human goal, is forbidden even if the act would redound to a person&#x2019;s financial advantage. Trapping an animal in order to sell its pelt is permitted; however, an act of wanton cruelty that is not designed to yield a human benefit is forbidden even if one receives remuneration for inflicting such pain upon the animal. The distinction is quite simple. Fur is used to satisfy a legitimate human need for clothing and hence money may be accepted in order to satisfy another person&#x2019;s need for the pelt. Wanton infliction of pain does not satisfy a legitimate human need and does not acquire legitimacy simply because one is paid for performing such an act.<sup><xref rid="fn433">6</xref></sup> Indeed, that conclusion is entirely cogent: otherwise forbidden acts of cruelty could be rendered permissible simply on the basis of a pact between two persons who agree to pay one another for engaging in such conduct.</p>
<p><italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> concedes that formula-feeding might be sanctioned if the purpose were to make the animals gain weight or to make the meat more tasty; both purposes reflect normal and legitimate human needs. <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> asserts that white veal is neither tastier nor more healthful than other veal; any claim of that nature he declares to be prohibited as fraud. <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> does not recognize any enhanced aesthetic appeal that may be associated with white veal as satisfying a legitimate human need and hence he rules that raising calves in an inhumane manner is forbidden.</p>
<p><italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>&#x2019;s halakhic points are certainly well-considered. However, he seems to have been provided with less than complete information. Some consumers do indeed prefer formula-fed veal because of its whiteness. However, feeding calves formula rather than grass or grain also significantly reduces the cost of producing veal. Moreover, there is no gainsaying the fact that the taste is entirely different. The taste of grass- or grain-fed veal is similar to mild beef; formula-fed veal has a much blander taste. Some consumers have a marked preference for one over the other. <italic>De gustibus non disputandum est</italic>. Whether the economic and/or gastronomical benefit is sufficient to warrant the incremental discomfort caused the calves is another matter.<sup><xref rid="fn434">7</xref></sup></p>
<h1>II. Kashrut <italic>Problems</italic></h1>
<p><italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> does, however, report that formula-fed calves have an inordinately high incidence of lumbar adhesions that render animals non-kosher. Ordinarily, there is no obligation to excise the internal organs, other than the lungs, of a slaughtered animal because disqualifying abnormalities are relatively rare. However, asserts <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, since it has been demonstrated that the conditions under which formula-fed calves are raised result in an extremely high rate of lung anomalies, it may well be the case that the diet and/or the living conditions to which those animals are subjected causes abnormalities in other organs as well. Accordingly, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> rules that the meat of formula-fed calves may not be eaten unless the internal organs are properly examined and that pious individuals should not rely even upon such examinations. Oral reports received subsequent to publication of that responsum indicate that such examinations have been carried out upon large numbers of formula-fed calves. Those examinations have not revealed a disproportionate rate of anomalies in organs other than the lung and serve to demonstrate that the concern expressed by <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> is without empirical basis.</p>
<p>More recently, questions have been raised with regard to the permissibility of eating formula-fed veal because of the ingredients of the formula. In addition to other ingredients, the formula contains significant quantities of animal fat and milk combined in powder form. The powdered formula is mixed with hot water poured into a large vat and stirred by means of an electrical implement. Rema, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 60:1, rules that the meat of an animal that &#x201C;all its life<sup><xref rid="fn435">8</xref></sup> has been fed only forbidden foods&#x201D; may not be eaten.<sup><xref rid="fn436">9</xref></sup> Calves fed formula containing a mixture of prohibited meat and milk, it has been contended, are animals raised solely upon non-kosher food and hence, according to Rema, their meat should be prohibited. In addition, the problem is further complicated by the fact that the cooking of milk and meat together does not simply yield a foodstuff that is forbidden for consumption but results in a product which is <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic>, i.e., from which no benefit may be derived.</p>
<p>Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum, the <italic>Nierbarter Rav</italic>, who is responsible for <italic>kashrut</italic> supervision of major purveyors of meat, has authored a permissive responsum dealing with those issues. Although that responsum is as yet unpublished it has been circulated among rabbinic scholars as has a rebuttal composed by R. Ya&#x2019;akov Yechezkel Sofer of Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p>Rema, relying upon earlier authorities, limits the prohibition against eating the meat of animals that have consumed forbidden foods solely to those animals that have been fed forbidden foods exclusively because only in such cases is the animal regarded as a &#x201C;<italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic>&#x201D; or &#x201C;product&#x201D; of the forbidden food. However, if the animal consumes both permitted and non-permitted foods, another principle, <italic>viz</italic>., <italic>zeh va-zeh gorem</italic>, becomes operative. The principle of <italic>zeh va-zeh gorem</italic> establishes that the product of two distinct causes, one permissible and the other non-permissible, is not prohibited since it is not the <italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic> solely of the product of a forbidden entity. In the case of formula-fed calves, the animal&#x2019;s development is attributable to two separate causes, one permissible and one non-permissible, and hence its meat is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn437">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rambam, in his <italic>Commentary on the Mishnah</italic>, <italic>Temurah</italic> 6:5 and in <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;akhalot Assurot</italic> 3:14, clearly rejects the notion that an animal is the &#x201C;<italic>yo&#x1E93;ei</italic>&#x201D; or &#x201C;product&#x201D; of the food it consumes in ruling that animals raised even on foods from which no benefit may be derived are permitted. Rambam rules that the meat of the animal is permitted because the forbidden foodstuff becomes &#x201C;changed,&#x201D; i.e., it metamorphoses in the process of digestion,<sup><xref rid="fn438">11</xref></sup> and hence, for purposes of Halakhah, the forbidden substance ceases to exist before it is turned into flesh.<sup><xref rid="fn439">12</xref></sup> Rema, however, apparently maintains that nutrients present in the forbidden food are absorbed and metabolized before the food becomes &#x201C;changed.&#x201D;</p>
<p><italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 60:5, disagrees with Rema with regard to animals that have been raised entirely on food forbidden for a Jew to eat but agrees that there is a prohibition if the animal is raised on <italic>issurei hana&#x2019;ah</italic>, i.e., food from which it is forbidden to derive any benefit whatsoever, even if the animal consumes both permitted and non-permitted foodstuffs. <italic>Shakh</italic> also notes that, even in such circumstances, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 142:11, rules that, <italic>post factum</italic>, the animal&#x2019;s meat is permissible unless the animal&#x2019;s &#x201C;primary development&#x201D; had resulted from consumption of <italic>issurei hana&#x2019;ah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn440">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Basing himself upon <italic>Issur ve-Hetter he-Arukh</italic> 47:9, <italic>Pri Megadim</italic>, <italic>Siftei Da&#x2019;at</italic> 60:5, rules that &#x201C;if it is [widely] known&#x201D; that the animal has been raised solely on only non-kosher food its meat is forbidden because of <italic>mar&#x2019;it ayin</italic>, i.e., possible confusion on the part of the onlooker.<sup><xref rid="fn441">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Teitelbaum asserts that formula-fed veal is permissible even though the animals are raised on forbidden foods for three separate reasons:</p>
<p>1) Despite the fact that <italic>Bi&#x2019;ur ha-Gra</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 60:1, concurs in the ruling of Rema, the majority of later authorities, including <italic>Pri &#x1E24;adash</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 60:5; <italic>Kereti u-Peleti</italic> 60:1; <italic>Teshuvot Pnei Yehoshu&#x2019;a</italic>, I, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 4; <italic>Da&#x2019;at Torah</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 60:5; <italic>Nishmat Adam</italic>, <italic>Hilkhot Pesa&#x1E25;</italic>, sec. 9; <italic>Arukh ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 60:7; as well as R. Yitzchak Yosef, <italic>Yalkut Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>, X (Jerusalem, 5749), pp. 143-147, accept the permissive view of <italic>Shakh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn442">15</xref></sup> In addition, a number of latter-day authorities extend that ruling to include even foodstuffs from which no ordinary or usual benefit may be derived but from which &#x201C;unusual&#x201D; benefit may be derived.<sup><xref rid="fn443">16</xref></sup> Those authorities assert that eating meat of an animal fed such food products is not considered to be a benefit &#x201C;usually&#x201D; derived from the forbidden foodstuff.</p>
<p>2) Rabbi Teitelbaum reports that even formula-fed calves are permitted to suckle for the first seven to ten days of their lives.<sup><xref rid="fn444">17</xref></sup> Thus, they have not been fed forbidden foods exclusively &#x201C;all their lives.&#x201D;</p>
<p>3) In addition to the forbidden meat and milk derivatives, the formula also contains a variety of innocuous ingredients. R. Dov Berish Weidenfeld, <italic>Teshuvot Dovev Meisharim</italic>, III, no. 50, rules that, even according to Rema, if the mixture fed to the animal contains only the &#x201C;taste&#x201D; of a forbidden food, i.e., the forbidden food has not been nullified by sixty equivalent measures of permitted food, the meat of the animal is permitted because the kosher portion of the mixture also contributes to the fattening of the animal<sup><xref rid="fn445">18</xref></sup> with the result that the animal has not been raised on forbidden food exclusively.<sup><xref rid="fn446">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Teitelbaum&#x2019;s first considerations may not be germane because <italic>Shakh</italic>&#x2019;s permissive view may not be applicable to formula-fed veal. <italic>Shakh</italic> permits the consumption of meat of animals raised on forbidden foods but he does not sanction eating meat of animals raised on food from which no benefit may be derived. Since the formula fed to the calves contains both meat and dairy ingredients that are combined and cooked together, it may be the case that it is forbidden to derive benefit from the mixture.<sup><xref rid="fn447">20</xref></sup> Even &#x201C;unusual&#x201D; forms of benefit may not be derived from meat and milk that have been commingled in cooking.<sup><xref rid="fn448">21</xref></sup> Hence the crucial issue is whether the formula contains milk and meat derivatives that have been &#x201C;cooked&#x201D; together.</p>
<p>In describing the process used in preparing the formula Rabbi Teitelbaum is somewhat unclear. In his introductory description Rabbi Teitelbaum stresses that hot water is released into a large vat and only afterwards is the powder mix stirred into the water. If so, &#x201C;cooking&#x201D; takes place in a <italic>keli sheni</italic>, i.e., a secondary utensil not in contact with fire. The general rule is that &#x201C;cooking,&#x201D; as generally understood in halakhic contexts, cannot take place in a secondary utensil. Even though, with regard to the prohibition against cooking that is prohibited on <italic>Shabbat</italic>, foodstuffs that are &#x201C;easily cooked&#x201D; may not be heated in a <italic>keli sheni</italic>, <italic>Teshuvot Maharil</italic>, no. 82, indicates that the concern is limited to violation of Sabbath restrictions but does not apply in other areas of Halakhah. Hence, since it is forbidden to derive benefit only from milk and meat that have been cooked together, milk and meat heated in a secondary utensil cannot become <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic>.</p>
<p>However, later in his discussion Rabbi Teitelbaum indicates that, at times, additional hot water is poured into the mixed formula already present in the vat in order to raise its temperature. As recorded by <italic>Tosafot</italic>, <italic>Zeva&#x1E25;im</italic> 95b, s.v. <italic>irah</italic>, there is a controversy with regard to whether a hot liquid poured from a primary utensil, i.e., a utensil heated on a stove, can effect the &#x201C;cooking&#x201D; of at least the upper surface to the depth of a &#x201C;peel&#x201D; of the substance on which it is poured. However, <italic>Pri Megadim</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, <italic>Mishbe&#x1E93;ot Zahav</italic> 88:9, maintains that the controversy is limited to a hot liquid falling upon a solid food but that all concur that no &#x201C;cooking&#x201D; occurs if the hot liquid is poured into a cold liquid. Similarly, no &#x201C;cooking&#x201D; occurs if the hot liquid falls upon a powder. In addition, R. Jacob of Lissa, <italic>&#x1E24;avvat Da&#x2019;at</italic>, <italic>Bi&#x2019;urim</italic> 91:7, maintains that a &#x201C;peel&#x201D; cannot become <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic> because cooking only the surface of a foodstuff is not a natural or usual form of &#x201C;cooking.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Moreover, even if the thickness of a &#x201C;peel&#x201D; is cooked and becomes <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic>, many authorities maintain that if the peel falls into other food and is not recognizable in the resultant mixture it is permitted to derive benefit from the mixture. Other authorities maintain that the forbidden &#x201C;peel&#x201D; is nullified only in a mixture sixty times as great. In addition, although some authorities differ, <italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 94:22, rules that if a mixture of cooked milk and meat becomes commingled with other food the resultant mixture is not treated as milk and meat but as a conventionally prohibited foodstuff and hence that mixture is not rendered <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic>. Furthermore, even those who differ with <italic>Shakh</italic> regarding this issue recognize that the resultant mixture is prohibited only by reason of rabbinic decree, rather than by biblical law. Hence, since there is no <italic>issur hana&#x2019;ah</italic> associated with milk and meat forbidden only by virtue of the rabbinic prohibition, the resultant mixture may be fed to animals.</p>
<p>In light of Rabbi Teitelbaum&#x2019;s premises, his discussion of whether or not the formula is <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic> seems to be somewhat superfluous. Rabbi Teitelbaum accepts the position of <italic>Shakh</italic> who maintains that there is no restriction even <italic>ante factum</italic> upon eating meat of an animal that has been raised on forbidden foods and that the problem exists only with regard to animals raised on feed that is <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic>. He further asserts that formula-fed calves are not raised all their lives on food that is <italic>assur behana&#x2019;ah</italic> because they suckle cow&#x2019;s milk the first seven to ten days of their lives and also because the major portion of the formula is comprised of kosher ingredients. Accordingly, it follows that, even were the formula to be deemed <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic>, the resultant problem would certainly affect the farmer who wishes to derive benefit from the use of such formula in feeding his cows. However, since under such circumstances the meat is permitted <italic>post factum</italic> on the basis of the principle of <italic>zeh va-zeh gorem</italic>, the consumer encounters no problem in purchasing the meat.</p>
<p>However, a complication with regard to the <italic>post factum</italic> status of such animals arises from the fact that the proprietors of many, and probably the majority, of slaughterhouses and meat processing plants are non-Jews. That is certainly true with regard to the cattlemen who raise calves. As is evident from <italic>Shakh</italic>&#x2019;s analysis of the ruling of <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yorah De&#x2019;ah</italic> 142:11, the meat of an animal that has been raised both on <italic>issurei hana&#x2019;ah</italic> and on permissible substances is, <italic>post factum</italic>, permitted on the basis of the principle of <italic>zeh va-zeh gorem</italic>. However, purchasing such an animal from a non-Jew might well be considered to be <italic>ante factum</italic> since refraining from doing so will result in no actual financial loss to a Jew. R. Ovadiah Yosef, <italic>Yabi&#x2019;a Omer</italic>, VII, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 7, sec. 1, demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of halakhic decisors regard a situation of that nature as <italic>post factum</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn449">22</xref></sup> It is certainly clear that if no other veal is available, or is not available at a reasonable price, all authorities would agree that the situation is to be regarded as <italic>post factum</italic>.</p>
<p>More significantly, Rabbi Teitelbaum&#x2019;s contention that the problem is obviated since the fact that the calves suckle after birth for a period of seven to ten days invokes a consideration that is certainly subject to dispute. <italic>Shakh</italic> himself asserts that Rema&#x2019;s reference to an animal that has consumed forbidden foods &#x201C;all its life&#x201D; is not to be understood literally but as connoting that the animal&#x2019;s primary development was the product of forbidden foodstuffs.<sup><xref rid="fn450">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Sofer&#x2019;s objections are based on a number of considerations that would render the formula <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic>:</p>
<p>1) <italic>Pri Megadim</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 318:30, maintains that &#x201C;easily cooked&#x201D; foodstuffs cooked in a secondary utensil are considered to be &#x201C;cooked&#x201D; not only for purposes of Sabbath prohibitions but also with regard to the prohibited cooking of milk and meat.</p>
<p>2) If the stream of hot water remains attached to its source and the powder is poured into the water, some authorities maintain that not only a &#x201C;peel&#x201D; of the powder is &#x201C;cooked&#x201D; but that the entire quantity of powder added in that manner is deemed to be &#x201C;cooked.&#x201D; Those authorities maintain that, in effect, each particle of powder is discrete and, since its thickness is less than that of a &#x201C;peel,&#x201D; each particle becomes cooked sequentially.</p>
<p>3) Even if the entire quantity of powder is placed in the vat before the hot water is introduced so that only a &#x201C;peel&#x201D; is &#x201C;cooked&#x201D; by the hot water, each successive &#x201C;peel&#x201D; is &#x201C;cooked&#x201D; as the powder is stirred while water is constantly added.</p>
<p>Rabbi Sofer further objects that it is forbidden to feed animals foodstuffs that contain even a &#x201C;taste&#x201D; of <italic>issurei hana&#x2019;ah</italic>. That objection is well-taken insofar as feeding animals is concerned. Direct benefit may not be derived from foodstuffs containing a &#x201C;taste&#x201D; of <italic>issurei hana&#x2019;ah</italic> because the &#x201C;taste&#x201D; of the forbidden substance cannot be separated from the food it permeates. However, as stated by <italic>Pri Megadim</italic> in his introduction to <italic>Hilkhot Basar be-&#x1E24;alav</italic>, permitted food containing a small quantity of <italic>issurei hana&#x2019;ah</italic> may be sold to a non-Jew provided that the value of the <italic>issurei hana&#x2019;ah</italic> is deducted from the purchase price. Similarly, insofar as an animal raised on such feed is concerned, the animal should be deemed to have been raised on a mixture of <italic>issurei hana&#x2019;ah</italic> and kosher food with the result that, <italic>post factum</italic>, the meat of the animal is permitted on the basis of the principle of <italic>zeh va-zeh gorem</italic>. Rabbi Sofer fails to address the additional consideration that the calves are fed cow&#x2019;s milk exclusively during the period immediately following birth.</p>
<h1>III. <italic>Conclusions</italic></h1>
<p>Resolution of the question of the permissibility of veal derived from formula-fed calves is dependent upon adjudication of a number of halakhic issues:</p>
<p>1. The primary issue is whether the formula is <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic> as a form of milk and meat that has been cooked together. That is unlikely to be the case for a number of reasons:</p>
<p>a) It may well be the case that the &#x201C;cooking&#x201D; of all but a small portion of the produced formula takes place in a secondary utensil.</p>
<p>b) A substantial portion of the formula consists of entirely innocuous ingredients. The consensus of opinion is that <italic>&#x1E25;atikhah na&#x2019;asit neveilah</italic> does not apply to otherwise permissible foodstuffs that absorb commingled milk and meat. Accordingly, the principle of <italic>zeh va-zeh gorem</italic> would serve to negate the prohibition against deriving benefit from commingled milk and meat.</p>
<p>The contention that the calves are suckled for seven to ten days during the initial post-partum period is probably not a sufficient factor to render the principle of <italic>zeh va-zeh gorem</italic> applicable but, in light of the foregoing that consideration is superfluous.</p>
<p>2. Assuming that the formula is not <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic>, the second issue is whether the meat of an animal raised exclusively on forbidden foods is prohibited. That issue would arise by virtue of the presence of non-kosher tallow in the formula even if the formula did not include milk derivatives. A permissive ruling with regard to that question is contingent upon:</p>
<p>a) acceptance of <italic>Shakh</italic>&#x2019;s view, in opposition to that of Rema and <italic>Bi&#x2019;ur ha-Gra</italic>, that the meat of an animal raised exclusively on forbidden foods is not forbidden; or</p>
<p>b) recognition that the formula contains innocuous ingredients in addition to the forbidden milk and meat derivatives coupled with rejection of the opinion that <italic>&#x1E25;atikhah na&#x2019;asit neveilah</italic> applies at least by virtue of rabbinic decree to forbidden substances other than commingled milk and meat;<sup><xref rid="fn451">24</xref></sup> or</p>
<p>c) the unlikely determination that suckling during the post-partum period is a factor sufficient enough to render the principle of <italic>zeh va-zeh gorem</italic> applicable.</p>
<p>Assuming that there is no problem of <italic>issur hana&#x2019;ah</italic> resulting from biblically prohibited cooked milk and meat, a kashrut supervisory authority would be justified in relying upon the position of <italic>Shakh</italic> since it appears to be accepted by the majority of latter-day authorities. However, certification of veal raised under such conditions as <italic>glatt</italic> kosher is more problematic.</p>
<p>The term <italic>glatt</italic>, or the Hebrew <italic>&#x1E25;alak</italic>, in its literal meaning refers to the fact that the lungs have been found to be &#x201C;smooth,&#x201D; i.e., no adhesions are present that might compromise the <italic>kashrut</italic> of the animal. The reason for that standard is that the presence of an adhesion requires a determination that the adhesion is not of a nature that would render the animal non-kosher. Such a determination usually requires adjudication between conflicting halakhic opinions and also presents issues with regard to the method employed in removal of the adhesions prior to examination for a possible perforation.</p>
<p>The Gemara, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 37b, cites Ezekiel 4:14; &#x201C;&#x2026; I have not eaten of <italic>neveilah</italic> or <italic>treifah</italic> from my youth until now,&#x201D; and offers a remarkable interpretation. <italic>Neveilah</italic> and <italic>treifah</italic> are forbidden to all Jews. It would have been unthinkable for Ezekiel to have violated those prohibitions. Hence, his almost boastful comment would have been entirely superfluous. Accordingly, the Gemara understands Ezekiel to have exclaimed, &#x201C;I have not eaten of an animal with regard to which a scholar ruled,&#x201D; i.e., Ezekiel, as an act of piety, refused to eat meat whose <italic>kashrut</italic> was the subject of any doubt even if it was ruled to be kosher by a competent scholar.</p>
<p>The term <italic>glatt</italic> in common parlance has acquired the connotation that food described in that manner is not in the category of <italic>behemah she-horah bah &#x1E25;akham</italic>, i.e., it is not a foodstuff whose <italic>kashrut</italic> was subject to question and whose acceptability is contingent upon a permissive determination by a scholar. That expanded connotation of the term <italic>glatt</italic> is entirely understandable since the piety adopted by Ezekiel and emulated by others was assuredly not limited to lumbar adhesions. Adhesions of the lungs are simply the most common problem requiring an opinion of a scholar with regard to the <italic>kashrut</italic> of the animal. Adjudication of a controversy between Rema and <italic>Shakh</italic> certainly entails a &#x201C;ruling of a scholar&#x201D; which those who adopt a <italic>glatt</italic> standard of <italic>kashrut</italic> would be unwilling to entertain.</p>
<p>There is one expedient that would serve to remove virtually all questions with regard to the permissibility of veal derived from formula-fed calves. A formula that contains no forbidden ingredients has been devised and patented.<sup><xref rid="fn452">25</xref></sup> However, for reasons that are not clear but which presumably are economic in nature, that product has not been adopted by the veal industry. <italic>Levushei Serad</italic>, IV, sec. 81, cited by <italic>Pit&#x1E25;ei Teshuvah</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 60:2, suggests that even if an animal is raised entirely upon forbidden foodstuffs its meat is permissible if the animal is fed permissible food exclusively &#x201C;two or three days&#x201D; prior to slaughter.<sup><xref rid="fn453">26</xref></sup> Although that authority does not make a final determination with regard to this matter, he strongly inclines to that view.<sup><xref rid="fn454">27</xref></sup> If so, feeding the calves kosher formula at least during the two- or three-day period preceding slaughter would obviate the problem.<sup><xref rid="fn455">28</xref></sup></p>

Water, however, is not a nutrient and, although it is certainly a major component of every cell in the animal&#x2019;s body, for halakhic purposes, it is not regarded as a fattening agent that produces body tissue. Were that not the case, in light of the fact that all animals require hydration in addition to nutrition, the halakhic discussions concerning animals raised on prohibited foodstuffs would be contrafactual. Cf., R. Moshe Chaim Schmerler of Zurich, <italic>Mesorah</italic>, no. XV (Tishri, 5759).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn445">18. This is so despite the principle of <italic>&#x1E25;atikhah na&#x2019;asit neveilah</italic>, i.e., a permitted food that absorbs the taste of a forbidden food becomes itself intrinsically forbidden. See <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 92:3. According to many authorities, including Rema, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 93:4, that rule applies not only to milk and meat but to other forbidden foods as well. Although milk and meat that are cooked together become intrinsically forbidden as a matter of biblical law, according to most authorities, foodstuffs that absorb other types of forbidden foods become intrinsically forbidden only by virtue of rabbinic decree. See <italic>Taz</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 92:11 and <italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 92:12. Cf., however, <italic>Maharik</italic>, no. 192, and sources cited by <italic>Pri Megadim</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, <italic>Siftei Da&#x2019;at</italic> 92:12. Similarly, according to most authorities, foodstuffs that absorb the forbidden taste of milk and meat become intrinsically forbidden by virtue of rabbinic law. Although the &#x201C;taste&#x201D; of the absorbed milk and meat is biblically prohibited, the intrinsic prohibition of the underlying substance of a foodstuff that has absorbed milk and meat is that of rabbinically proscribed milk and meat. See <italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 94:22. [<italic>Shakh</italic> also cites the conflicting view of <italic>Ba&#x1E25;</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 96:3, who maintains that foodstuffs that absorb milk and meat become intrinsically forbidden by virtue of biblical law in the same manner as the commingled meat and milk itself.] Since rabbinically forbidden milk and meat is not <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic>, the portion of the formula that is neither meat nor dairy serves as a <italic>gorem</italic>, or cause, from which it is not forbidden to derive benefit and hence the principle of <italic>zeh va-zeh gorem</italic> remains applicable.</ftnote>
<ftnote>However, <italic>Dovev Meisharim</italic> apparently fails to take cognizance of Rema&#x2019;s ruling, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 93:4, to the effect that the principle of <italic>&#x1E25;atikhah na&#x2019;asit neveilah</italic>, i.e., the entire substance of a foodstuff that absorbs a forbidden taste becomes intrinsically forbidden, applies not only to milk and meat cooked together but also, at least by virtue of rabbinic decree, to a mixture containing any forbidden substance. If so, to the extent that the mixture fed to the animals contains even the &#x201C;taste&#x201D; of non-kosher food, the entire mixture is intrinsically forbidden and hence, according to Rema, the meat of the animal should be forbidden since it has been raised exclusively on an intrinsically forbidden foodstuff.</ftnote>
<ftnote>R. Shalom Toibes, <italic>Teshuvot She&#x2019;ilat Shalom</italic>, <italic>Mahadura Tinyana</italic>, no. 152, adds the interesting observation that, other than with regard to milk and meat that have been cooked together, in the opinion of some authorities, the principle of <italic>&#x1E25;atikhah na&#x2019;asit neveilah</italic> is not applicable in instances in which the admixture occurred &#x201C;in the hands of a non-Jew,&#x201D; i.e., while owned by a non-Jew. See <italic>Teshuvot Rema</italic>, no. 54 and <italic>Pri Megadim</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, <italic>Siftei Da&#x2019;at</italic> 103:14, s.v. <italic>ve-hineh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn446">19. Although <italic>Dovev Meisharim</italic> addresses a situation in which the major portion of the mixture is kosher, his reasoning would seem to apply equally to instances in which only a minor portion of the ingredients is kosher.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn447">20. It should be noted that milk and meat of a member of a non-kosher species cooked together do not become <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic>. See <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 87:3. Rambam, <italic>Commentary on the Mishnah</italic>, <italic>Keritut</italic> 3:4, maintains that such is also the case with regard to the meat of an animal of a kosher species that has not been properly slaughtered. That view is accepted by R. Ezekiel Landau, <italic>Dagul me-Revavah</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 87:3. If so, since the tallow contained in the formula in question is derived from non-kosher sources, the formula would not become <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic>. However, <italic>Pri Megadim</italic>, introduction to <italic>Hilkhot Basar be-&#x1E24;alav</italic>, s.v. <italic>od</italic>, and R. Moses Sofer, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 92, reject that view. Hence, according to those authorities, tallow obtained from a non-kosher species, when cooked with milk, becomes <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic>. Moreover, R. Akiva Eger, <italic>Bei&#x1E93;ah</italic>, <italic>ma&#x2019;arakhah zayin</italic>, asserts that, even for Rambam, it is only the non-kosher meat that does not become <italic>assur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic>, but that no benefit may be derived from the portion of that mixture consisting of milk cooked with such meat.</ftnote>

<h1><italic>Priestly Identity</italic></h1>
<p>Marriage between a person of Aharonic descent and a divorc&#x00E9;e is expressly forbidden by Leviticus 21:7. As recorded by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic> 6:8, marriage between a <italic>kohen</italic> and a female convert is also prohibited. The late Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, of blessed memory, is widely quoted as having ruled that <italic>ba&#x2019;alei teshuvah</italic>, i.e., newly-observant young men, whose fathers were not observant may be permitted to marry divorc&#x00E9;es or converts to Judaism despite the fact that they have held themselves out as <italic>kohanim</italic>. The reasoning, it is reported, is that the assumption of priestly descent on the part of such a person is derived entirely from his father&#x2019;s genealogical claim. Since the father was, and remains, non-observant, his testimony, it is claimed, as a matter of Halakhah, can be given no credence.</p>
<p>This issue is discussed in two remarkably brief responsa published in <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, IV, no. 11 and no. 39. The particular situation discussed by <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> in his first responsum, dated 5721, involved a man already married to a convert who presumed that he was a <italic>kohen</italic> on the basis of the fact that on a single occasion on which his father was &#x201C;called to [the Torah at] a <italic>bar mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> celebration&#x201D; the father stated that he was a <italic>kohen</italic>. <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> describes the father as totally non-observant and in the same sentence adds that the father &#x201C;also ran away from his father&#x2019;s house in his youth because of rebellion against his father&#x201D; so that &#x201C;presumably (<italic>lefi ha-da&#x2019;at</italic>) he could not properly know a matter such as this.&#x201D; <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> further takes note of the fact that a female cousin declared that her father, a brother of the gentleman&#x2019;s father, challenged her cousin&#x2019;s claim to priestly descent declaring, &#x201C;How is that possible that you are a <italic>kohen</italic> since my father, who is your father&#x2019;s brother, is not a <italic>kohen</italic>?&#x201D; Without further analysis of the grounds for his ruling, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> proceeds to declare that since the gentleman&#x2019;s priestly identity was established solely on the basis of the declaration of his father &#x201C;who has no credibility&#x201D; with regard to that matter, the son is not obliged to divorce his wife. The discussion does not reveal whether that conclusion is based solely upon the father&#x2019;s lack of religious observance, upon the father&#x2019;s unreliable recollection due to the particular circumstances of his relationship with his family, upon the cousin&#x2019;s contradictory evidence or upon a combination of those considerations.</p>
<p><italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>&#x2019;s ruling was understood as based upon the confluence of those considerations in a decision of a Jerusalem <italic>bet din</italic> established for purposes of ruling on matters of personal status. The decision of that <italic>bet din</italic>, comprised of the respected Sephardic authority, the late R. Eliyahu Abba Sha&#x2019;ul, R. Abraham Dov Levine and Rabbi Eliyahu Shlesinger is published in <italic>Piskei Din me-Bet ha-Din le-Dinei Mammonot u-Birur Yahadut shel ha-Rabbanut ha-Rashit le-Yerushalayim</italic>, vol. I (5755), part 2, pp. 43-54.</p>
<h3>1. <italic>Credibility of a Parent</italic></h3>
<p>It is entirely likely that, were the matter to hinge entirely upon the father&#x2019;s credibility, Rabbi Feinstein would have maintained that the father&#x2019;s lack of observance would be sufficient, in and of itself, to dismiss his testimony. In doing so Rabbi Feinstein would simply have been relying upon his own opinion as announced in <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, I, no. 82, <italic>anaf</italic> 11 and reiterated in <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, IV, no. 32, <italic>anaf</italic> 7, to the effect that even a <italic>tinok ha-nishbah bein ha-akum</italic>, i.e., a child held in captivity among the pagans, has no credibility. That understanding of Rabbi Feinstein&#x2019;s position is bolstered, but not unequivocally confirmed, by his discussion in the second of those responsa, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, IV, no. 39. Surprisingly, the Jerusalem <italic>bet din</italic> fails to make any reference to the latter responsum.</p>
<p>The latter responsum, written in 5738, addresses the status of a newly observant man married to a non-Jewish woman with whom he had a child. The woman in question was apparently eligible for conversion as a righteous proselyte but would have been forbidden to marry a <italic>kohen</italic>. The gentleman&#x2019;s grandfather immigrated to this country from behind the Iron Curtain in 1923. The gentleman in question presumed himself to be a <italic>kohen</italic> solely on the basis of information imparted to him by his father.</p>
<p>The family reportedly had &#x201C;no knowledge whatsoever of Torah or Judaism.&#x201D; Since the father &#x201C;knew nothing&#x201D; and it is clear that the grandfather made no attempt whatsoever to educate his child &#x201C;even in some matters&#x201D; of a Jewish nature, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> deduces that the grandfather was both a Communist and an atheist and was already a &#x201C;thoroughly evil&#x201D; person (<italic>rasha gamur</italic>) when he arrived in this country. Accordingly, concludes <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, the grandfather had no credibility to claim priestly descent. That statement, standing alone, would certainly indicate that the grandfather&#x2019;s lack of observance, or his atheism, was dispositive with regard to his non-credibility.</p>
<p><italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, however, adds a number of additional comments. The progenitor&#x2019;s testimony is not to be accepted, asserts <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, &#x201C;particularly since [the grandson] did not hear this from his grandfather who perhaps may have at least studied in a <italic>&#x1E25;eder</italic> before the Communist conquest even though there were already many irreligious people (<italic>&#x1E25;ofshim</italic>) in the cities of the Ukraine in the fourth and fifth year of this century &#x2026; nevertheless, they certainly knew a little even though they had no credibility.&#x201D; The reader can only register puzzlement with regard to the thrust of those comments: If such individuals lack credibility what difference can be effected by their knowledge of Jewish practices or by the grandfather&#x2019;s attendance at a <italic>&#x1E25;eder</italic>? The statement seems to reflect equivocation between a statutory lack of credibility and lack of credibility due to sheer ignorance.</p>
<p>Moreover, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> places weight upon the fact that the couple had already established a non-halakhic marital relationship which, he maintains, should not be disturbed on the basis of the available information. Also incorporated in that statement is <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>&#x2019;s sensitivity to the fact that if the gentleman&#x2019;s status as a <italic>kohen</italic> is confirmed and he is informed that marriage to this woman subsequent to her conversion is forbidden &#x201C;it is certain that one must be concerned&#x201D; that, in all likelihood he will return to his prior non-observant lifestyle. At the same time, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> expresses a strong inclination, but not a certainty, that such a person may be permitted to marry a convert or a divorc&#x00E9;e even in the absence of those factors.</p>
<p>In his first responsum <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> dismisses the statement of the father, not because he was a heretic, but because he was a Sabbathdesecrator. The principle formulated by the Gemara, <italic>Eruvin</italic> 69b, is that public desecration of the Sabbath is tantamount to heresy. That principle is predicated upon the premise that open and notorious desecration of the Sabbath is evidence that the transgressor denies that God created the universe over a period of six days and rested on the seventh. That talmudic presumption went unchallenged until the mid-nineteenth century. R. Jacob Ettlinger, <italic>Teshuvot Binyan &#x1E92;ion ha-&#x1E24;adashot</italic>, no. 23, reports a socioreligious phenomenon, novel in nineteenth-century Germany but all too familiar in twentieth-century America, viz., the existence of countless numbers of Jews who offered Sabbath prayers and recited <italic>kiddush</italic> each Sabbath eve but then proceeded to desecrate the Sabbath by engaging in all manner of forbidden activity. Is it logical, queries <italic>Binyan &#x1E92;ion</italic>, for a person who denies creation to devoutly recite &#x201C;And the heaven and earth and all their hosts were complete. And on the seventh day God completed the world which He made and He rested on the seventh day&#x2026;.&#x201D; (Genesis 2:1-2). The notion of a believing Sabbath-desecrator might have been an oxymoron in a bygone age but in the modern world, argues <italic>Binyan &#x1E92;ion</italic>, it is a new reality. In the modern age, whether because of financial duress or other factors, that phenomenon is all too real. Others, who are raised in irreligious homes, know no better and have the status of &#x201C;a child who was held in captivity among pagans.&#x201D; Accordingly, in light of the changed realia, rules <italic>Binyan &#x1E92;ion</italic>, the talmudic presumption of heresy does not attach itself to such persons.</p>
<p><italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, I, no. 33 reaches the same conclusion but on somewhat different grounds. <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> queries why a person who violates the Sabbath in private should be viewed less severely than one who desecrates the Sabbath in public. In private, he submits, it may be assumed that the trespasser acts out of weakness and desire rather than because of disbelief. When the transgression is performed in public onlookers observe an act of heresy whereas the individual&#x2019;s motives and intent are concealed from them. In our day, contends <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, since &#x201C;it is known that the majority of Sabbath-violators [act] because of desire for lucre&#x201D; onlookers do not perceive such acts to be heretical in nature. Hence there is no longer a distinction between Sabbath desecration, in private and in public. R. David Zevi Hoffmann, <italic>Melamed le-Ho&#x2019;il</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 28, reasons simply that, in an age of rampant Sabbath desecration, people have become desensitized to the severity of the transgression. Since they perceive no need to conceal their actions, argues <italic>Melamed le-Ho&#x2019;il</italic>, public desecration of the Sabbath, in our day, is no more onerous than private transgression in times gone by.</p>
<p>Although disputed by others,<sup><xref rid="fn456">1</xref></sup> the basic position, albeit sometimes formulated on the basis of different halakhic nuances, has been espoused by a long list of rabbinic authorities.<sup><xref rid="fn457">2</xref></sup> Even those who disagree concede that a person who grows up among non-observant Jews has the status of a &#x201C;<italic>tinok ha-nishbah bein ha-akum</italic>,&#x201D; i.e., &#x201C;a child held in captivity among the pagans&#x201D; who is not to be treated as a heretic since he never knew better. In effect, invincible ignorance is a shield against the halakhic sanctions and disqualifications suffered by a heretic with the result that a person who was raised in a non-observant environment and denied a meaningful Jewish education is to be regarded as having the status of &#x201C;a child held in captivity.&#x201D;</p>
<p><italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, I, no. 82, <italic>anaf</italic> 11 and IV, no. 39, maintains, however, that, although such individuals suffer no other sanction, they are disqualified from serving as witnesses, not because of inherent &#x201C;wickedness,&#x201D; but for the simple reason that such persons have no compelling reason to be truthful. The testimony of a believing Jew is accepted because he recognizes perjury to be a sin. A person who has no knowledge of the binding nature of the Sinaitic revelation has no such constraint; hence his testimony can be given no credence.<sup><xref rid="fn458">3</xref></sup> It would follow that a person having knowledge of the prohibition against false testimony, but who professes no commitment to the observance of any of the commandments, would, according to <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, be similarly disqualified as a witness since he is under no imperative to be truthful. R. Yehudah Leib Diskin, <italic>Teshuvot Maharil Diskin</italic> (Jerusalem, 5691), p. 108, sec. 5, seems to adopt a similar view. That is also clearly the opinion of <italic>Teshuvot Maharshakh</italic>, III, no. 15, who comments with regard to those in the category of a <italic>tinok ha-nishbah</italic>: &#x201C;It is not proper to accept them as witnesses for after all they transgress many commandments&#x2026;. [Is] it conceivable that [such a person] be accepted for testimony since he does not act in the manner of proper Jews?&#x201D;</p>
<p>A contradictory position was espoused by the Israeli Rabbinical Court of Appeals in 5708 in an opinion issued by R. Ben-Zion Uziel, R. Isaac ha-Levi Herzog and R. Meshullem Roth published in <italic>Osef Piskei Din Rabbaniyim</italic> (Jerusalem, 5710), pp. 137-138, a slim volume that served as a precursor to the <italic>Piskei Din Rabbaniyim</italic>. The case involved a woman divorced from a <italic>kohen</italic> who claimed that she and her former, but now deceased, husband had remarried and hence she was entitled to the rights and prerogatives of a widow. Since marriage between a <italic>kohen</italic> and a divorc&#x00E9;e is forbidden the marriage was solemnized without benefit of clergy but in the presence of witnesses. At issue was a challenge to the validity of the marriage by virtue of the fact that the witnesses were non-observant and, in the case of one witness, there was testimony that he had been seen smoking in public on <italic>Shabbat</italic>. The <italic>bet din</italic> refused, albeit somewhat tentatively, to disqualify the witnesses arguing that &#x201C;in a time and a place in which non-observance has multiplied and spread &#x2026; &#x201D; transgressions of this nature do not undermine the credibility of witnesses. In the situation of such great &#x2018;hiding of the face&#x2019; [the witnesses] are virtually inadvertent transgressors.&#x201D; Disqualification of transgressors or witnesses is because of fear of false testimony &#x201C;and accordingly the credibility of the witness must be assessed in accordance with the circumstances of the time and the place&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 137). The <italic>bet din</italic> was prepared to accept such testimony, not only in instances of invincible ignorance, but even in situations in which the improper conduct might be attributed to sociological factors. Quite clearly, the <italic>bet din</italic>, unlike <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, assumed that witnesses abjure perjury not solely because of a divine mandate to do so but because of the innate, natural human condition. According to that view a non-observant father would have credibility to testify with regard to his son&#x2019;s status as a <italic>kohen</italic>.</p>
<p>Indeed, it would be entirely consistent even with <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>&#x2019;s position to assert that, although individuals who do not accept the veracity of revelation at Sinai have no credibility, nevertheless, those who accept the basic phenomenon but, due to ignorance of its provisions, economic pressures, unrestrained desire or convenience are largely nonobservant, retain credibility concerning matters with regard to which they are scrupulous. The individual described in <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>&#x2019;s first responsum was totally non-observant; the individual described in the second responsum is depicted as an atheist. Neither responsum addresses the phenomenon of the somewhat knowledgeable, selectively-observant, professing Jew.</p>
<p>Moreover, in addressing an entirely different issue, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> himself asserts that, at times, even an avowed atheist has credibility with regards to matters of religious law. Rabbi Feinstein, <italic>Iggerot Moshe</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, I, no. 54, reports that on a visit to Moscow in 1936 he was consulted with regard to an agonizing question. Circumstances forced many elderly and infirm individuals to live with their children. Those children, living under the influence of the Communist state, did not observe <italic>kashrut</italic> and &#x201C;the majority denied God and His Torah.&#x201D; Nevertheless, they accommodated their aged parents by purchasing kosher food and providing kosher utensils on their behalf. The issue presented to Rabbi Feinstein was the credibility of those children with regard to <italic>kashrut</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> responded that a parent might indeed rely upon his child&#x2019;s guarantees of <italic>kashrut</italic> provided that the parent was firmly convinced that the &#x201C;daughter or daughter-in-law&#x201D; would not cause the parent to transgress. Such conviction would arise, asserts <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, if the parent &#x201C;tested&#x201D; the homemaker on a number of occasions and ascertained that no attempt was made to fool the parent because the child &#x201C;did not want to cause him pain or because it was the nature [of the child] not to cause others to act contrary to their will.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In explaining his ruling, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> argues that rules governing disqualification of witnesses pertain only to acceptance of testimony with regard to individuals whose nature is unknown. Statements of such individuals are accepted on the basis of &#x201C;belief&#x201D; in the truth of their testimony rather than on the basis of knowledge. Citing an anecdote recorded in <italic>Ketubot</italic> 85a, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> asserts that, in a situation in which a person has personal knowledge of another individual&#x2019;s unchallengeable probity, his acceptance of the latter&#x2019;s statement is a matter of &#x201C;knowledge&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;belief&#x201D; and hence he may act on such statements even if that person is not qualified to serve as a witness.<sup><xref rid="fn459">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>It would then follow that, even according to <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, if the son is absolutely certain that his father, despite the fact that the latter is a Sabbath-violator or even an atheist, would not lie with regard to matters of religious observance, the son whose priestly genealogy has been disclosed by his father, is deemed to &#x201C;know&#x201D; that fact to be true and must comport himself accordingly.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem <italic>bet din</italic>, in its decision, failed to address another issue affecting disqualification of witnesses. <italic>Bet Yosef</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic> 42, s.v. <italic>ma&#x1E93;&#x2019;ati</italic>, describes an incident involving a person who entered into a marriage in the presence of witnesses who were known to have committed serious transgressions. One authority, a certain R. Chaim he-Arukh, declared the marriage to be null and void. The Sages of Tilutula challenged the ruling and placed R. Chaim he-Arukh under a ban until such time as he would rescind that ruling. Their position was that a person cannot be disqualified unless testimony establishing his wrongdoing is heard in his presence by a properly constituted <italic>bet din</italic>. Since that had not occurred they maintained that the marriage was valid.<sup><xref rid="fn460">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>A similar position is espoused by <italic>Teshuvot ha-Ba&#x1E25;</italic>, no. 102; <italic>Urim ve-Tumim</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Misphat</italic>, <italic>Urim</italic> 28:3 and <italic>Tumim</italic> 87:27; <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 11; <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;ikrei Lev</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 1; <italic>Netivot ha-Mishpat</italic>, <italic>Bi&#x2019;urim</italic> 46:22, cited by <italic>Pit&#x1E25;ei Teshuvah</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 28:1; <italic>Teshuvot Pnei Aryeh</italic>, no. 28, cited by <italic>Pit&#x1E25;ei Teshuvah</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic> 42:18; and R.

<h3>2. <italic>Personal Credibility</italic>&#x2014;Shavya Anafsheih</h3>
<p>The Jerusalem <italic>Bet Din le-Birur Yahadut</italic> addressed a case similar to that brought to the attention of <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> and ruled in a different manner in at least one salient aspect. The case involved a newly-observant Russian couple. The wife had previously been married to a non-Jew and hence was disqualified from marrying a <italic>kohen</italic>. The husband had been informed of his family&#x2019;s priestly status by his non-observant father.</p>
<p>The general rule is that a person has standing, even when contradicted by trustworthy witnesses, to declare that certain matters are prohibited to him. Thus a person may not eat a foodstuff he has declared to be non-kosher even though others are fully entitled to rely upon the contradicting testimony of two witnesses. The resultant principle is known as &#x201C;<italic>Shavya anafsheih &#x1E25;atikha de-issura</italic>&#x2014;He has established upon himself a prohibited piece.&#x201D; Similarly, a person has credibility to declare himself a <italic>mamzer</italic> and consequently forbidden to marry a Jewess of legitimate birth. Although such credibility is generally limited to oneself, nevertheless, as recorded by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Issurei Bi&#x2019;ah</italic> 15:15-16, a father is granted specific authority to declare his son to be a <italic>mamzer</italic>, most particularly when he testifies directly with regard to his son&#x2019;s status. That authority is derived from the biblical verse &#x201C;<italic>yakir</italic>&#x2014; he shall recognize&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 21:17). If the father testifies that he himself is a <italic>mamzer</italic> and, by implication, that status is shared by his son as well, some authorities maintain that the father&#x2019;s testimony creates only a doubtful status with regard to the son.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem <italic>bet din</italic> raised an intriguing issue in questioning whether the rule of &#x201C;<italic>yakir</italic>&#x201D; is limited to disqualification as a <italic>mamzer</italic> or whether it applies also to acknowledging a son as a <italic>kohen</italic> who is then bound by attendant marital restrictions. A person certainly has credibility to declare himself a <italic>kohen</italic> for purposes of being forbidden to marry a divorc&#x00E9;e. The question is whether or not he can generate the selfsame prohibition with regard to his son. If yes, argued the <italic>bet din</italic>, the father&#x2019;s lack of observance is of no consequence. A father is disqualified from serving as a witness in any matter affecting his son. Nevertheless, despite the paternal-filial relationship that exists between them, the rule of &#x201C;<italic>yakir</italic>&#x201D; endows the father with credibility despite such ostensive disqualification; similarly, that principle establishes credibility even in face of other disqualifications as a witness.</p>
<p>Moreover, argued the <italic>bet din</italic>, the son who had declared himself a <italic>kohen</italic>, albeit on the strength of his father&#x2019;s declaration, has created his own <italic>shavya anafsheih</italic> quite apart from the implications flowing from the father&#x2019;s declaration.<sup><xref rid="fn462">7</xref></sup> <italic>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</italic>, I, no. 362, advances the thesis that <italic>shavya anafsheih</italic> is established not only on the basis of alleged personal knowledge but also on the basis of the acceptance of statements of others. That position is also reflected in the comments of <italic>Tosafot</italic>, <italic>Kiddushin</italic> 66a, s.v. <italic>Rava</italic>, as well as the ruling of <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, I, no. 78, cited by <italic>Pit&#x1E25;ei Teshuvah</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic> 115:25.<sup><xref rid="fn463">8</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> dismissed the issue of <italic>shavya anafsheih</italic> in the first case brought to his attention because the son&#x2019;s presumption of his status as a <italic>kohen</italic> was predicated entirely upon the statements of his non-observant father. The Jerusalem <italic>bet din</italic> chose to interpret <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>&#x2019;s comment regarding the father&#x2019;s lack of observance, not as a reference to that factor <italic>per se</italic>, but in the context of the total fact pattern, i.e., because of the father&#x2019;s non-observance he had no knowledge of what priesthood connotes and may therefore have been engaged in idle speculation. Accordingly, the <italic>bet din</italic> declared that a different result would obtain in a situation in which a non-observant father explicitly presents the information in the context of transmitting a family tradition and the report is accepted by the son as credible. That interpretation would appear to be compelled unless <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> is to be understood as rejecting the notion that <italic>shavya anafsheih</italic> may arise from reliance upon statements of others.</p>
<p>However, the Jerusalem <italic>bet din</italic> acknowledged that <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> may have dismissed the issue of <italic>shavya anafsheih</italic> for a different reason. The <italic>bet din</italic> presumed that the principle of <italic>shavya anefsheih &#x1E25;atikha deissura</italic> is limited to actual and intended declaration of a prohibition or <italic>issura</italic> rather than to the establishment of facts that give rise to a prohibition. Accordingly, in the case at hand, the <italic>bet din</italic> ruled that <italic>shavya anafsheih</italic> would be applicable only if the person making such representations was cognizant of the fact that, as a result of declaring himself to be a <italic>kohen</italic>, he would be forbidden to marry a divorc&#x00E9;e. That view is consistent with the position of <italic>Teshuvot Shev Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>, cited by <italic>Ke&#x1E93;ot ha</italic>-<italic>&#x1E24;oshen</italic> 80:2, who maintains that <italic>shavya anafsheih</italic> is a form of vow and hence is applicable only if the person understands the consequences of his statement; otherwise, it is a vow undertaken in error and therefore of no effect.<sup><xref rid="fn464">9</xref></sup> <italic>Ke&#x1E93;ot ha-&#x1E24;oshen</italic> himself rejects that view and advances the thesis that <italic>shavya anefsheih</italic> simply reflects the credibility that the Torah extends to a person&#x2019;s statements insofar as they affect himself. Accordingly, <italic>Ke&#x1E93;ot ha-&#x1E24;oshen</italic> regards ignorance of the implications of such a statement to be inconsequential. <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, in his previously-cited responsum, adopts a position compatible with that of <italic>Shev Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> in ruling that a husband who declares that his wife has committed adultery may not continue the marital relationship even though, when making the statement, the husband was unaware of the halakhic rule forbidding an adulterous wife to her husband.<sup><xref rid="fn465">10</xref></sup></p>
<h3>3. &#x1E24;azakah</h3>
<p>Another factor that must be considered with regard to the question of priestly identity is the possibility that investigation would disclose the existence of a <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic> with regard to the family&#x2019;s priestly status. In this context, the notion of <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic> is nothing other than common knowledge within a community of the status of an individual or of his forebears. Thus, although the father may never have attended synagogue and hence never have been accorded Torah honors, it may be the case that there are records in the archives of the European community from which the family hailed indicating that the grandfather was a <italic>kohen</italic>. Discovery of such information subsequent to marriage to a woman forbidden to a <italic>kohen</italic> would be disastrous. Although the matter has not received attention in the responsa literature, a gravestone indicating that the grandfather was a <italic>kohen</italic> might be deemed evidence of &#x201C;common knowledge&#x201D; of such status within the community.<sup><xref rid="fn466">11</xref></sup> That consideration becomes even more compelling if, as often was the case in European communities, gravestone inscriptions were supervised by the local <italic>&#x1E25;evra kaddisha</italic> (burial society).<sup><xref rid="fn467">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whether the existence of a <italic>ketubah</italic> indicating that the father or grandfather was a <italic>kohen</italic> is evidence of priestly status is a matter of controversy among early authorities. Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Issurei Bi&#x2019;ah</italic> 20:9, regards such evidence as sufficient to create at least doubtful status and to entitle such an individual to partake of priestly offerings obliged by rabbinic, and distinct from biblical, decree. Re&#x2019;ah, cited by Ran, <italic>Ketubot</italic> 24b, and Ritva, <italic>ad locum</italic>, express doubt with regard to whether any evidentiary weight is to be assigned to such instruments. <italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 49:15, explains that the underlying issue is whether the attesting witnesses testify only to the substantive provisions recorded in the document or whether they testify to ancillary matters contained therein as well.</p>
<p>The <italic>bet din</italic> also opined that the family name &#x201C;Cohen&#x201D; is sufficient to establish a presumption of priestly status.<sup><xref rid="fn468">13</xref></sup> The <italic>bet din</italic> reasoned that, since the &#x201C;vast majority&#x201D; of individuals bearing the name &#x201C;Cohen&#x201D; are <italic>kohanim</italic>, ascription of that name to the family generates a <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic> or presumptive evidence of priestly status. In a footnote the <italic>bet din</italic> takes cognizance of the opinion of R. Israel Meir Lau, <italic>Ya&#x1E25;el Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, I, no. 30, who maintains that, absent a family tradition to that effect or a <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic> established by individual members of the family, the surname alone is not dispositive. His primary consideration is that, in some European communities, marriages were not registered in a timely fashion with the result that, not infrequently, children were registered as bearing the mother&#x2019;s family name.</p>
<p>In a response to an inquiry by the <italic>bet din</italic> in a different case published by the Jerusalem <italic>bet din</italic> in <italic>Piskei Din</italic>, <italic>ibid.</italic>, III, part 2, p. 291, R. Samuel ha-Levi Woszner declares that the family name is of no consequence in determining priestly status.</p>
<h1><italic>Marriage of a</italic> Kohen <italic>and the Daughter of a Non-Jew</italic></h1>
<p>In a decision issued on 19 Iyar 5766, the Rabbinical District Court of Rehovot confirmed its earlier ruling declaring an applicant for a marriage license to be eligible to contract a marriage as a Jewess but denied her permission to marry a <italic>kohen</italic> on the grounds that she was the issue of a union between a Jewish woman and a non-Jewish man.<sup><xref rid="fn469">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The decision, on the surface, was routine and unexceptionable. Denial of the application for a marriage license was based upon an explicit provision of Halakhah recorded twice in <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic> 4:5 and 4:19 and implicit in the ruling of <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic> 7:17. The Rehovot <italic>bet din</italic> composed a detailed analysis of the basis of that ruling only because the case was remanded to them on appeal for further consideration by the Supreme Rabbinical Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>The Gemara, <italic>Yevamot</italic> 45a, posits a controversy among the <italic>Amora&#x2019;im</italic> regarding the status of the progeny of a union of a non-Jewish man and a Jewish woman. One opinion is that the child born of such a liaison is a <italic>mamzer</italic> while a second opinion maintains that the child is legitimate but, if a female, is forbidden to marry a priest. The Gemara, <italic>Yevamot</italic> 45b, concludes, &#x201C;The law is that if a non-Jew or a slave consorts with a daughter of Israel the child is legitimate.&#x201D; Ostensibly, that definitive ruling represents an adjudication of the earlier controversy and the term &#x201C;<italic>kosher</italic>&#x201D; or &#x201C;legitimate&#x201D; is used as the antonym of &#x201C;<italic>mamzer</italic>&#x201D; or &#x201C;bastard&#x201D; with the implication that the child is legitimate but nevertheless forbidden to a <italic>kohen</italic> as had earlier been stated. Rosh understands the Gemara in that manner and rules that the daughter is certainly forbidden to a <italic>kohen</italic>.</p>
<p>Rif, however, states that some authorities rule that the daughter is not only legitimate but permitted to a <italic>kohen</italic> as well. Presumably, the rationale underlying that position is that, since there is no halakhically recognized paternal-filial relationship between the biological father and the child, there is no basis for disqualifying her from marrying a <italic>kohen</italic>. The term <italic>kosher</italic> is understood by the authorities cited by Rif as &#x201C;legitimate&#x201D; in the fullest sense of the term and the dictum is understood by him, not as adjudication between two conflicting views, but as the expression of a third, previously unexpressed position, which is pronounced to be normative.</p>
<p>Ramban, <italic>Yevamot</italic> 45a, similarly asserts that the Gemara records three distinct views with regard to the status of such progeny and, although the Gemara clearly rules that the child is not a <italic>mamzer</italic>, there is no definitive ruling with regard to whether a daughter of such a liaison may marry a <italic>kohen</italic>. Since the issue remains a matter of doubt, Ramban rules that such a girl may not enter into marriage with a <italic>kohen</italic> but, <italic>post factum</italic>, if such a marriage has been celebrated, they cannot be compelled to divorce.<sup><xref rid="fn470">15</xref></sup> Ramban ascribes that view to Rif as well. The view that Rif regards the matter as remaining in doubt is supported by the published text of Rif.<sup><xref rid="fn471">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>As previously noted, the prohibition against marriage of such a woman to a <italic>kohen</italic> is explicitly codified by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> in two places, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic> 4:5 and <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic> 4:19. Both <italic>&#x1E24;elkat Me&#x1E25;okek</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic> 4:3 and 7:26, and <italic>Bet Shmu&#x2019;el</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic> 4:2 and 7:39, confirm Ramban&#x2019;s view in ruling that the daughter of such a liaison is forbidden to marry a <italic>kohen</italic> but, if already married, the couple need not be compelled to divorce.<sup><xref rid="fn472">17</xref></sup> That ruling is explicitly accepted by R. Moshe Feinstein, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, I, no. 6. R. Ovadiah Yosef, <italic>Teshuvot Yabi&#x2019;a Omer</italic>, VII, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, no. 60, is in fundamental agreement with that position but rules that, since Ramban regards the status of such a woman to be doubtful, in the presence of a second &#x201C;doubt,&#x201D; e.g., the status of the prospective groom as a <italic>kohen</italic> is itself doubtful, the marriage may be permitted on the basis of <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> or &#x201C;double doubt.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The case heard by the <italic>bet din</italic> of Rehovot involved one additional consideration. Before applying for a marriage license the couple had been living together for a period of approximately one-and-a-half years and had announced that, if a license was denied, they would continue to do so without benefit of marriage. The issue of a <italic>kohen</italic> already living with the daughter of a Jewish mother and a non-Jewish father pursuant to civil marriage has been analyzed by R. Moshe Feinstein in his earlier-cited responsum<sup><xref rid="fn473">18</xref></sup> and by the late Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, R. Shalom Mashash, <italic>Shemesh u-Magen</italic>, III, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, nos. 55 and 58.</p>
<p>Ramban&#x2019;s position that the status of such a woman is unresolved led him to rule that she may not marry a <italic>kohen</italic> but, if married, the couple cannot be compelled to divorce. That ruling seems somewhat contradictory. The couple is forbidden to marry because of the possibility of transgression. The selfsame possibility of transgression persists within an already contracted marital union. If so, would not logical consistency lead to the conclusion that, if married, they must divorce? A number of latter-day authorities have endeavored to resolve that perplexity.</p>
<p>One possible solution is that the prohibition is rabbinic in nature and the edict was not designed to apply <italic>post factum</italic>. However, the most cogent resolution is that advanced by <italic>Sha&#x2019;ar ha-Melekh</italic>, <italic>Hilkhot Issurei Bi&#x2019;ah</italic> 15:3. A divorce executed under duress by a <italic>bet din</italic> is valid only if there are halakhic grounds for coercion. However, asserts <italic>Sha&#x2019;ar ha-Melekh</italic>, if the transgression is doubtful, it follows that the grounds for coercion are also doubtful. If so, argues <italic>Sha&#x2019;ar ha-Melekh</italic>, a <italic>get</italic> cannot be compelled in cases of doubt born of halakhic controversy because its validity would perforce be a matter of doubt with the result that the woman could not be permitted to remarry on the strength of such a <italic>get</italic>. Nevertheless, as a matter of religious law, the parties themselves are forbidden to continue to live together as man and wife. <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> accepts <italic>Sha&#x2019;ar ha-Melekh</italic>&#x2019;s explanation in ruling that a religious ceremony may not be performed for such a couple despite the fact that they have been living together in an ongoing relationship pursuant to civil marriage.<sup><xref rid="fn474">19</xref></sup> <italic>Sha&#x2019;ar ha-Melekh</italic>&#x2019;s resolution of the problem is particularly compelling if it is accepted that the prohibition is biblical in nature.</p>
<p>Rabbi Mashash, on the other hand, in his previously cited responsum, was quite willing to permit marriage of such couples not only in situations in which a civil marriage had already taken place<sup><xref rid="fn475">20</xref></sup> but also in situations in which the parties had already been sharing an abode.<sup><xref rid="fn476">21</xref></sup> He bases his conclusion upon two considerations:</p>
<p>1) A Jew suspected of consorting with a non-Jewish woman may not marry her subsequent to her conversion. However, if they have already married he is not obligated to execute a <italic>get</italic>. There is significant controversy with regard to whether, in such a situation, civil marriage constitutes a <italic>post factum</italic> condition. Those opinions have been analyzed in detail by this writer in <italic>Contemporary Halakhic Problems</italic>, I (New York, 1977), 286-290. Rabbi Mashash chooses to cite only the permissive opinions and entirely ignores the opposing position. He then summarily equates the case of a union between a <italic>kohen</italic> and the daughter of a non-Jew with that of a Jew suspected of having had a sexual relationship with a non-Jewish woman.</p>
<p>Apart from the controversy with regard to the effect of civil marriage in the latter situation, according to <italic>Sha&#x2019;ar ha-Melekh</italic>&#x2019;s explanation of the rationale underlying that provision in the case of a <italic>kohen</italic>, the two situations are obviously entirely dissimilar.</p>
<p>Rashi, <italic>Yevamot</italic> 24b, explains that the prohibition against a Jew marrying a convert with whom he is suspected of having had a liaison was promulgated in order to safeguard the honor and reputation of the husband since marriage under such circumstances is likely to lend credence to rumors of previous immorality. Accordingly, some authorities conclude that the prohibition does not extend to situations in which the couple have been living together publicly since in such cases previous immoral conduct is an established verity.<sup><xref rid="fn477">22</xref></sup> <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</italic>, I, no. 1,205, explains that, if the couple are suspected of having lived together previously, their marriage subsequent to conversion will lead to suspicion that the conversion itself was insincerely contrived for purposes of marriage. Accordingly, a number of authorities assert that, according to Rashba, if the couple have already established a permanent conjugal relationship, there can be no grounds for the suspicion that the conversion was insincerely entered into merely for the sake of marriage.<sup><xref rid="fn478">23</xref></sup> Quite obviously, according to these lines of reasoning, in the case of a converted paramour, civil marriage or a longstanding conjugal relationship is not equated with a valid marriage as creating a <italic>post factum</italic> situation but is regarded as rendering the prohibition entirely nugatory.</p>
<p>2) Rabbi Mashash asserts, again quite unequivocally, that in both instances the prohibition is rabbinic in nature and hence lenience is in order in matters of doubt. It is certainly the case that the prohibition against marrying a proselyte in the situation described is rabbinic in nature but it is far from clear that such is the case with regard to a <italic>kohen</italic> and the daughter of a non-Jewish father. Indeed, if the prohibition is merely rabbinic and if, as Ramban maintains, the permissibility of such a marriage is a matter of doubt, it is difficult to understand why the marriage is not permitted even <italic>ab initio</italic>. R. Moshe Feinstein, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, I, no. 5, depicts the prohibition as based upon doubt with regard to a biblical transgression. Nevertheless, <italic>Teshuvot Rema mi-Panu</italic>, no. 124, <italic>&#x1E24;elkat Me&#x1E25;okek</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic> 7:26, <italic>Teshuvot R. Akiva Eger</italic>, no. 91 and <italic>Bet Me&#x2019;ir</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic> 4:5, regard the prohibition as rabbinic in nature.<sup><xref rid="fn479">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Shlomoh Amar, <italic>Shema Shlomoh</italic>, V, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, no. 8, endorses Rabbi Mashash&#x2019;s ruling and adds that, in a sexually promiscuous age such as ours, it is quite possible that the groom&#x2019;s mother may have engaged in sexual conduct that would serve to deprive any future progeny of the priesthood.</p>
<p>The <italic>bet din</italic> of Rehovot took note of the opinions of Rabbis Mashash and Amar but declined to accept them as authoritative. The matter was appealed to the Supreme Rabbinical Court of Appeals and, in a brief decision, the Court of Appeals simply cited the responsa of Rabbis Mashash and Amar, reversed the ruling of the rabbinical district court and &#x201C;requested&#x201D; the rabbinate of Rehovot to perform the marriage.<sup><xref rid="fn480">25</xref></sup> One of the members of the panel hearing this case was R. Shlomoh Amar.</p>
<p>The halakhic authority of the Israeli Supreme Rabbinical Court of Appeals to reverse decisions of district courts is not at all clear. That issue has been discussed by this writer in <italic>Contemporary Halakhic Problems</italic>, IV (New York, 1995), 17-45. The theories offered in support of such authority are much more persuasive in matters of jurisprudence than in matters of religious law. The general rule &#x201C;If a scholar has prohibited another scholar dare not permit&#x201D; (<italic>Berakhot</italic> 63b, <italic>Avodah Zarah</italic> 77b, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 44b and <italic>Niddah</italic> 20b) admits of exceptions in instances of clear error. It does, however, bar exercise of purely subjective discretion in choosing one set of precedents over another.</p>
<p>It is difficult to believe that any objective scholar would find Rabbi Mashash&#x2019;s reasoning absolutely compelling. It is impossible to fault the <italic>bet din</italic> of Rehovot for assaying greater weight to the responsa of Rabbis Feinstein and Yosef than to those of Rabbis Mashash and Amar. It is quite easy to conclude that the lower court&#x2019;s decision was overruled simply because Rabbi Amar chose to follow his own previously announced opinion.</p>
<p>Such a course of action might well be legitimate were Rabbi Amar able to allege a lack of cogency in the opposing view or to show that the weight of precedent contradicted the decision of the lower court. This he made no attempt to do. Mere preference for one set of precedents over another without a clear elucidation of doctrinal support is not the manner in which appellate review is carried out in the common law judicial system from which the Israeli system of rabbinic appellate review was adopted. Such a procedure strikes this writer as a misuse of appellate power.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is some question with regard to whether the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Rabbinical Court extends to &#x201C;non-adversarial&#x201D; matters. In an unpublished decision issued in 5702, Index no. 1/46/701, the Supreme Rabbinical Court held that it had appellate authority in all matters. However, in a subsequent unpublished decision issued in 5716 the Supreme Rabbinical Court ruled that it had no authority to hear appeals in &#x201C;non-adversarial&#x201D; matters, i.e., in determining issues of Jewish religious law since such matters are not within the ambit of authority granted to the <italic>bet din</italic> by virtue of the applicable Israeli civil law. The issue before the court involved the conversion of a minor child by its Jewish father in face of the announced opposition of its non-Jewish mother. The district court declared that it was not acting by virtue of the powers vested in a <italic>bet din</italic> to adjudicate disputes but was simply announcing a matter of religious law. The Supreme Rabbinical Court ruled that such matters are not subject to appeal.<sup><xref rid="fn481">26</xref></sup> The question of whether a daughter of a non-Jewish father is permitted to marry a <italic>kohen</italic> is similarly a non-adversarial issue of religious law.<sup><xref rid="fn482">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, as cogently demonstrated by <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, even in circumstances in which the couple will continue to cohabit even without benefit of marriage, celebration of a wedding ceremony is tantamount to rabbinic license to commit an even graver transgression. According to many early-day authorities, cohabitation outside of marriage constitutes a rabbinic infraction. Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Issurei Bi&#x2019;ah</italic> 17:12, maintains that priestly conjugal prohibitions are biblically binding only within a marital relationship. Thus, according to Rambam, performance of a wedding ceremony transforms what would otherwise be a rabbinic infraction into a more serious biblical transgression.</p>
<p>It is, however, not inconceivable that the same result might have been achieved on the basis of other considerations. As pointed out by Rabbi Feinstein in his earlier-cited responsum, in Jewish law, cohabitation for purposes of marriage creates a marital relationship when such is the intention of the parties. Whether or not such intention is presumed in a relationship tantamount to common law marriage depends upon whether the presumption that couples do not engage in fornication when the option of a marital union is available is applicable in situations of the nature described. An analysis of that very complex issue is beyond the scope of the present discussion. Suffice it to say that a <italic>bet din</italic>, in appropriate circumstances, might reasonably have concluded that the existence of a valid halakhic marriage necessitating a <italic>get</italic> for its dissolution was at least a matter of doubt. Since, in the case of a <italic>kohen</italic> married to the daughter of a non-Jew, a <italic>get</italic> cannot be compelled, it should follow that the recalcitrant parties may not be prevented from regularizing their relationship by means of a formal marriage.</p>
<h1><italic>Sonograms and the Unborn</italic> Kohen</h1>
<p>The verse &#x201C;Speak unto the priests, the sons of Aaron and say unto them&#x2026;.&#x201D; (Leviticus 21: 1) serves as a prefatory comment to the prohibition against priestly defilement through contact with a corpse. The <italic>Gemara</italic>, <italic>Yevamot</italic> 114a, takes note of the double expression &#x201C;speak&#x201D; and &#x201C;say unto them&#x201D; in declaring that Moses was instructed to transmit two prohibitions: 1) a commandment addressed to adult priests forbidding them to defile themselves; and 2) a directive commanding adults not to defile young priests who have not yet attained the age of halakhic majority. The latter prohibition is recorded in <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 373:1. Rema adds that the prohibition is limited to the performance of an overt act on the part of an adult causing defilement of the minor. As explained by <italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 373:1, intervention to restrain a child from defiling himself is mandated only by virtue of a father&#x2019;s obligation with regard to <italic>&#x1E25;innukh</italic>, i.e., &#x201C;training,&#x201D; and hence is limited to the child&#x2019;s father and, moreover, becomes applicable only at an appropriate age. The opinion of <italic>Ba&#x1E25;</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 373, to the effect that even an infant must be prevented from defiling himself is not accepted by other authorities. However, <italic>Magen Avraham</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 343:2, and <italic>Mishnah Berurah</italic> 343:3 emphasize that actively causing defilement is forbidden even in the case of a child completely lacking in reason.</p>
<p>R. Eliezer ben Judah of Worms, <italic>Sefer Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>, no. 366, declares that the pregnant wife of a <italic>kohen</italic> may enter a building in which a corpse is present by virtue of application of the principle of <italic>sefek sefeika</italic>, i.e., &#x201C;double doubt.&#x201D; There are two separate contingencies that would render defilement permissible, <italic>viz.</italic>, perhaps the pregnant woman will miscarry because the fetus she is gestating is not viable and, even if the fetus is viable, perhaps it is a female. There is no prohibition against defiling either a non-viable fetus or a daughter of a <italic>kohen</italic>. However, <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic> certainly maintains that, in principle, it is forbidden to defile a fetus. <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s ruling is confirmed by <italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 371:1.</p>
<p>Although <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s position is accepted as normative, there are reasons for stringency on the part of the wife of a <italic>kohen</italic> in refraining from coming into contact with a corpse. R. Chaim Chizkiyahu Medini, <italic>Sedei &#x1E24;emed</italic>, <italic>ma&#x2019;arekhet ha-samakh</italic>, sec. 71, cites a number of authorities who assert that, although it is permissible to rely upon a &#x201C;double doubt,&#x201D; it is nevertheless a meritorious act of piety not to do so.</p>
<p><italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s construction of this <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> is challenged by <italic>Pri Megadim</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, <italic>Eshel Avraham</italic> 343:2. <italic>Tosafot</italic>, <italic>Ketubot</italic> 9a, s.v. <italic>ve-i ba&#x2019;it eima</italic>, declare that a doubt resolved by virtue of the principle of <italic>rov</italic>, or majority, does not constitute a cognizable doubt at all. <italic>Tosafot</italic> opine that the occurrence of rape generally becomes known to the public. Hence, in a significant majority of all sexual acts that do not give rise to reports of rape, intercourse is willful. Accordingly, declare <italic>Tosafot</italic>, the contingency of rape cannot be deemed a matter of doubt for the purpose of constructing a <italic>sefek sefeika</italic>. Similarly, argues <italic>Pri Megadim</italic>, the majority of pregnancies result in viable neonates; hence the possibility of miscarriage should not constitute a doubt for purposes of generating a <italic>sefek sefeika</italic>.</p>
<p>R. Moshe Sofer, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 354, resolves that difficulty by pointing out that the principle of <italic>rov</italic> serves, in and of itself, to determine that in the majority of cases the woman commits no transgression in causing her fetus to be defiled. Fifty percent of all fetuses are female<sup><xref rid="fn483">28</xref></sup> while some fetuses are not viable. The result is that in any given pregnancy there is less than a fifty percent chance that defiling the fetus entails a forbidden act.<sup><xref rid="fn484">29</xref></sup> Although <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic> invokes the principle of <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> rather than <italic>rov</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> asserts that the principle involved is indeed that of <italic>rov</italic> and that <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s nomenclature is merely unfelicitous. There are indeed two separate factors to be considered&#x2014;and hence <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s use of the term <italic>sefek sefeika</italic>&#x2014;the possibility of a female fetus and the possibility of a nonviable fetus; however the two factors combine not to generate a <italic>sefek sefeika</italic>, but to generate a <italic>rov</italic>.</p>
<p>Acceptance of the thesis that <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic> is expressing the concept of <italic>rov</italic> rather than <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> yields yet another ramification. The putative practice of not relying upon a &#x201C;double doubt&#x201D; does not apply to not relying upon <italic>rov</italic>. <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> himself, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 83, forcefully comments, &#x201C;He who commanded and admonished us with regard to the <italic>treifah</italic> is He who commanded us to rely upon <italic>rov</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn485">30</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Magen Avraham</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 346:2, takes issue with the basic principle upon which <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s comment is based. As noted, <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic> assumes that it is forbidden to cause defilement not only to a minor but also to a fetus. <italic>Magen Avraham</italic> challenges that assumption on technical grounds. One of the principles governing defilement as recorded in the Mishnah, <italic>Oholot</italic> 5:4, is that a &#x201C;swallowed&#x201D; (<italic>balu&#x2019;ah</italic>) object can neither defile nor become defiled. Thus, for example, if a person swallows a metal ring and then enters a room in which a corpse is present, the ring is not subject to the regulations governing ritual impurity. The fetus, argues <italic>Magen Avraham</italic>, is &#x201C;swallowed&#x201D; within the mother&#x2019;s body and hence is not subject to defilement. If so, there is no reason why the pregnant wife of a <italic>kohen</italic> may not come into contact with a corpse.<sup><xref rid="fn486">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. David ibn Zimra, <italic>Teshuvot Radvaz</italic>, I, no. 200, resolves the problem by postulating that <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s concern was limited to situations involving a pregnant woman approaching term. In such situations there is reason to fear that labor may commence at any time and hence that the child&#x2019;s head may enter the birth canal in the early stages of parturition while the woman is yet under the same roof as the corpse. Since, for purposes of Jewish law, the child is considered to be &#x201C;born&#x201D; when the major portion of the forehead enters the birth canal, the child would no longer be deemed &#x201C;swallowed&#x201D; within the mother&#x2019;s abdomen and hence would become subject to defilement. A similar observation is made by <italic>Netiv &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> in a marginal comment on <italic>Magen Avraham</italic>, <italic>ad locum</italic>. According to those authorities, <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic> had no need to justify contact with a corpse on the part of a pregnant woman during earlier periods of gestation since the fetus will assuredly remain entirely within her body; the need for justification was limited to the final stage of pregnancy when there is reason to fear that the infant&#x2019;s head may emerge.</p>
<p>R. Jacob Emden, <italic>She&#x2019;ilat Ya&#x2019;ave&#x1E93;</italic>, II, no. 177, advances a completely opposite interpretation of <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s position. <italic>She&#x2019;ilat Ya&#x2019;ave&#x1E93;</italic> contends that <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s comment is designed to justify contact with a corpse only during early stages of pregnancy but that, according to <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>, the pregnant wife of a <italic>kohen</italic> is indeed forbidden contact with a corpse during the ninth month of pregnancy. As does <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, <italic>She&#x2019;ilat Ya&#x2019;ave&#x1E93;</italic> dismisses the notion of <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> on the grounds that, since the majority of pregnancies do not result in either a miscarriage or stillbirth, the possibility of a non-viable fetus does not constitute a halakhically cognizable doubt. Hence contact with a corpse during the ninth month, when emergence of the forehead is a distinct possibility, is forbidden. <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>, he contends, was concerned with establishing the permissibility of such contact only during earlier stages of pregnancy.</p>
<p>Such justification is necessary, argues <italic>She&#x2019;ilat Ya&#x2019;ave&#x1E93;</italic>, because, in order to obviate error and confusion, the Gemara, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 72a, in a different context, extends the rules cogently applicable during the ninth month of pregnancy to earlier stages of pregnancy as well. Ostensibly, that consideration should also apply in the case of a pregnant wife of a <italic>kohen</italic>. Accordingly, explains <italic>She&#x2019;ilat Ya&#x2019;ave&#x1E93;</italic>, <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic> intended to explain that contact with a corpse is not prohibited during earlier stages of pregnancy lest the pregnant woman assume that such contact is permitted during the final stages of pregnancy as well. <italic>She&#x2019;ilat Ya&#x2019;ave&#x1E93;</italic> asserts that <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic> reasons that no such ban is applicable because of the remote nature of the concern, i.e., there is no actual concern in the earlier stages of pregnancy because the fetus&#x2019; head is unlikely to emerge from the uterus and, even were the woman to place herself in such a situation during the final stages of pregnancy, the fetus may be either female or nonviable. In effect, as does <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, albeit for a different reason, <italic>She&#x2019;ilat Ya&#x2019;ave&#x1E93;</italic> understands <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic> as declaring simply that the contingency that is the subject of concern is remote and hence not a matter of halakhic concern, but not as contending that the principle of <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> is technically applicable.</p>
<p>R. Chaim Joseph David Azulai, <italic>Birkei Yosef</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 343:4, rejects the applicability of the principle of <italic>tum&#x2019;ah balu&#x2019;ah</italic> on the basis of the talmudic opinion, <italic>Gittin</italic> 23b, that maintains that the fetus is deemed to be an integral part of the mother&#x2019;s body (<italic>ubbar yerekh imo</italic>). As recorded by R. Jacob Ettlinger, <italic>Teshuvot Binyan &#x1E92;ion</italic>, no. 96, R. Pinchas Shiffer, writing to Rabbi Ettlinger, explains that <italic>Birkei Yosef</italic>&#x2019;s contention is that the fetus cannot be considered to be &#x201C;swallowed&#x201D; since it is an integral part of the mother&#x2019;s body. Nevertheless, since the gender of the fetus is male rather than female, the fetus is subject to the rules governing defilement.</p>
<p><italic>Binyan &#x1E92;ion</italic> dismissively rejects that understanding of <italic>Birkei Yosef</italic> on the grounds that to declare the fetus to be an integral part of the mother&#x2019;s body but to have the status of a male is a contradictory assertion. <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, in his previously cited responsum, without citing <italic>Birkei Yosef</italic>, reports that he had earlier considered the issue of <italic>tum&#x2019;ah balu&#x2019;ah</italic> as inapplicable, at least prior to commencement of labor, because of the principle <italic>ubbar yerekh imo</italic>. However, upon reflection, <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> declares that he has reversed his earlier view because of the pronouncement of the Gemara, <italic>Yevamot</italic> 67a, that &#x201C;a fetus in the womb of a non-<italic>kohen</italic> is a non-<italic>kohen</italic>,&#x201D; i.e., priestly status, and hence the applicability of the prohibition against defilement, devolves upon the fetus only upon parturition.</p>
<p>R. Moshe Sternbuch, <italic>Teshuvot ve-Hanhagot</italic>, I, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 679, quotes the <italic>Brisker Rav</italic>, R. Yitzchak Ze&#x2019;ev Soloveitchik, as advancing an entirely opposite view in stating that a male fetus does indeed have the status of a <italic>kohen</italic>. The statement of the Gemara to the effect that the fetus is not a <italic>kohen</italic> is limited, he contends, to laws of <italic>terumah</italic>, <italic>viz.</italic>, although the mother of a <italic>kohen</italic> may partake of <italic>terumah</italic>, a women carrying a fetus who is a <italic>kohen</italic> may not partake of <italic>terumah</italic>. The fetal <italic>kohen</italic>, according to this analysis, enjoys the status of a <italic>kohen</italic>, particularly with regard to matters of defilement, but is not a <italic>kohen</italic> who can cause his mother to become eligible to partake of <italic>terumah</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Min&#x1E25;at &#x1E24;innukh</italic>, no. 263, espouses a diametrically opposed position in maintaining that even were the fetus to be regarded as rendering its mother eligible to partake of <italic>terumah</italic>, the fetus itself, since it is an integral part of the mother&#x2019;s body, is not subject to strictures concerning defilement.</p>
<p><italic>Binyan &#x1E92;ion</italic> himself offers a novel interpretation of <italic>Birkei Yosef</italic>&#x2019;s position. The fetus, as an integral part of the mother&#x2019;s body, becomes defiled together with its mother. But since there is no prohibition against defilement of the mother, such defilement as part of the mother&#x2019;s body is entirely innocuous. However, defilement to which a fetus is subjected during pregnancy persists subsequent to parturition. Accordingly, contends <italic>Binyan &#x1E92;ion</italic>, <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic> was concerned that upon birth it becomes retroactively clear that, in coming into contact with a corpse while pregnant, the mother caused prohibited future defilement of a <italic>kohen</italic>. Although no transgression is incurred until the fetus is actually separated from the mother, the earlier act causing future defilement of a <italic>kohen</italic> would be prohibited save for the principle of <italic>sefek sefeika</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Avnei Milu&#x2019;im</italic> 82:1 dismisses the issue of <italic>tum&#x2019;ah balu&#x2019;ah</italic> by citing the rule that immersion of a pregnant woman for purposes of conversion <italic>ipso facto</italic> constitutes immersion of the child as well despite the fact that the mother&#x2019;s body serves as a <italic>&#x1E25;a&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ah</italic>, or interposition, preventing the water of the <italic>mikveh</italic> from coming into direct contact with the child. The Gemara, <italic>Yevamot</italic> 88b, explains that the mother&#x2019;s body is not an interposition because &#x201C;that is the way it grows&#x201D; (<italic>hainu reviteih</italic>), i.e., only a foreign object constitutes an interposition whereas the mother&#x2019;s body in which the fetus gestates is hardly alien to the fetus.</p>
<p>In effect, <italic>Avnei Milu&#x2019;im</italic> postulates that the reason a &#x201C;swallowed&#x201D; object is not subject to defilement is because the object in which it is encased serves as an interposition between the object and the source of defilement. The mother&#x2019;s body, however, does not constitute such an interposition.</p>
<p>R. Samuel ha-Levi Woszner, <italic>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, II, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 25, challenges <italic>Avnei Milu&#x2019;im</italic>&#x2019;s equation of the principle of <italic>tum&#x2019;ah balu&#x2019;ah</italic> with the notion of interposition. The Mishnah, <italic>Niddah</italic> 43b, declares that a newborn child can become defiled through contact with a corpse. The Mishnah clearly excludes defilement of the fetus <italic>in utero</italic>. As explained by <italic>Mishnah A&#x1E25;aronah</italic>, <italic>ad locum</italic>, the reason is that prior to parturition the fetus is &#x201C;swallowed&#x201D; within the womb and, accordingly, is not subject to defilement. Hence, <italic>Magen Avraham</italic>&#x2019;s puzzlement with regard to <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s comment is well-founded.</p>
<p>R. Elchanan Wasserman, <italic>Kove&#x1E93; Shi&#x2019;urim</italic>, II, no. 41, resolves the problem in a highly original manner. Reb Elchanan maintains that a <italic>kohen</italic> is forbidden contact with a corpse even in circumstances in which he does not becomes defiled. In support of that thesis he cites the halakhic provision prohibiting a <italic>kohen</italic> from being in the same building as a <italic>goses</italic>, i.e., a moribund person, despite the fact that the <italic>kohen</italic> does not become defiled by virtue of his presence in that building. A fetal <italic>kohen</italic> &#x201C;swallowed&#x201D; in his mother&#x2019;s body, contends Reb Elchanan, is indeed in the same building as the corpse and is forbidden to be in that building even though he does not thereby become defiled.<sup><xref rid="fn487">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>At present, many obstetricians perform sonograms upon pregnant women for cogent medical reasons. Although performed for other purposes, such sonograms generally reveal the gender of the fetus. If the fetus is a male, and its gender is disclosed to the mother, <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>&#x2019;s <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> no longer exists since the fetus is known with virtual certainty to be male. Obviously, according to Radvaz, <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> and <italic>Netiv Yam</italic> who assert that <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic> was concerned only with regard to a woman in labor or approaching term, there is no problem with regard to defilement during earlier stages of pregnancy. However, according to the authorities who regard a <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> to be necessary even during earlier stages of gestation, the wife of a <italic>kohen</italic> whose sonogram has revealed that she is carrying a male fetus would be forbidden to come into contact with a corpse other than in situations of <italic>pikua&#x1E25; nefesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn488">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>The situation of a woman who has undergone a sonogram but who has not been informed of the fetus&#x2019; gender is somewhat different. To her, there is a <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> but one of those doubts might be resolved by means of a simple inquiry. <italic>Pri Megadim</italic>, <italic>Siftei Kohen</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 110, <italic>Kelalei Sefek Sefeika</italic> 35:66, rules that when &#x201C;mere inquiry&#x201D; would resolve the doubt, it is obligatory to solicit such information. The crucial question, now that sonograms are available, and if they are to be regarded as posing no hazard to the health of either the mother or the fetus,<sup><xref rid="fn489">34</xref></sup> is whether the pregnant wife of a <italic>kohen</italic> is obligated to undergo a sonogram before coming into contact with a corpse. <italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 110, <italic>Kelalei Sefek Sefeika</italic>, sec. 35:66, records two opinions with regard to whether a <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> may be relied upon in circumstances in which the &#x201C;double doubt&#x201D; may be dispelled on the basis of examination or investigation. <italic>Shakh</italic> rules that it is necessary to be stringent &#x201C;when [it is] possible and no loss is incurred.&#x201D; R. Shlomoh ha-Kohen of Vilna, <italic>Teshuvot Binyan Shlomoh</italic>, no. 13, similarly maintains that a <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> that may be resolved cannot be relied upon.<sup><xref rid="fn490">35</xref></sup> Nevertheless <italic>Shakh</italic> rules that no investigation is necessary if such investigation would entail expense. A sonogram, presumably, does entail such an expense.</p>
<p>R. Ezekiel Landau, <italic>Teshuvot Noda bi-Yehudah</italic>, <italic>Mahadura Kamma</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 43 and no. 97, maintains that even the authorities who require resolution of the doubt posed by a <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> when such doubt can be resolved by inquiry or investigation do so only when both doubts can be resolved, but not if one of the doubts will persist even subsequent to the investigation. In the case of a pregnant woman, the doubt with regard to the viability of the fetus would indeed remain since it is not dispelled by means of a sonogram. However, according to <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>&#x2019;s understanding of <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;</italic>, since the vast majority of fetuses are viable, the operative consideration is not <italic>sefek sefeika</italic> but the consideration that the majority of fetuses are not viable males. According to <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, the principle actually relied upon is that of <italic>rov</italic>. The general rule is that a <italic>rov</italic> may be relied upon even when examination is possible except in instances in which there is a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic>, i.e., a significant number of exceptions to the <italic>rov</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn491">36</xref></sup> The incidence of viable male fetuses is certainly a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic> and, accordingly, examination for gender should be required according to <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>. If the fetus is shown to be male, the principle of <italic>rov</italic> serves to establish that the overwhelming majority of fetuses are viable.</p>
<p>Examination for a <italic>mi&#x2019;ut ha-ma&#x1E93;ui</italic> is required only when such examination is possible. Thus, for example, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 39:2 rules that a slaughtered animal whose lungs have been lost or misplaced prior to examination for adhesions<sup><xref rid="fn492">37</xref></sup> may be regarded as kosher on the basis of <italic>rov</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn493">38</xref></sup> It is certainly not permissible to perform an ultrasound test solely to determine gender if the procedure is accompanied by any cogent medical risk,<sup><xref rid="fn494">39</xref></sup> with the result that such examination is, in the halakhic sense, &#x201C;impossible.&#x201D; A determination regarding the safety of the procedure can be made only by a physician familiar with the available data and is subject to revision as more information becomes available.</p>

The Jerusalem <italic>bet din</italic> seems to cite <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, I, no. 78, s.v. <italic>hinei</italic>, as adopting the position that <italic>shavya anafsheih</italic> is operative only if the individual making the pronouncement is aware of its halakhic implications. In point of fact, <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> asserts something rather different. <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> declares that a <italic>kohen</italic> who announced that he believes his wife&#x2019;s statement that she was raped may recant upon learning that, if such were the case, she would be prohibited to him. <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>&#x2019;s rationale is not that failure to appreciate the consequence defeats <italic>shavya anafsheih</italic> but that, once the <italic>kohen</italic> becomes aware of the prohibition against continued marital relations, he realizes that there may have been a motive for his wife to fabricate the account. The fact that <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> found it necessary to advance that explanation tends to indicate that he rejects the view of <italic>Shev Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>.

<ftnote>Even at present, when cemeteries are owned by the <italic>&#x1E25;evra kaddisha</italic>, it exercises control over gravestone inscriptions as evidenced by several instances of litigation in recent years.

In recent years there has been a decline in the proportion of male births in North America and Western Europe.

Delivery itself, in this writer&#x2019;s opinion, may take place in a hospital because parturition is categorized by Halakhah as a threat to the life of the mother and the danger, again in this writer&#x2019;s opinion, is significantly mitigated by delivery in a hospital.

<ftnote id="fn489">34. Basic research on harnessing the Doppler effect in the use of ultrasound waves for medical diagnostics was performed more than sixty years ago by the Viennese neurologist K.T.

<ftnote>In recent years the power outputs of clinical devices have increased with the result that the potential for both thermal and non-thermal insults has become greater. The risk of inducing thermal effects is greater in the second and third trimesters while sheer stresses from radiation pressure may be of concern in early gestation. The likelihood of producing undesired biological effects can be enhanced by new procedures such as use of gas encapsulated echocontrast agents. See S.B. Barnett and D.

<h1>I. <italic>The Controversy</italic></h1>
<p>Some time ago an incident occurred involving a socially inept American student who became the butt of his classmates&#x2019; derisive behavior. Matters reached a point at which one of the tormentors regularly invaded the oppressed student&#x2019;s knapsack, stole the sandwich the latter had prepared for lunch and proceeded to eat it himself. Endeavors to enlist the aid of fellow classmates in order to identify the thief or to prevail upon him to put an end to the practice were of no avail. Finally, the victim, who excelled academically as a chemistry student, took matters into his own hands and proceeded one day to lace his sandwich with a poison. In the midst of an afternoon lecture one of the members of the class became violently ill. In the course of the ensuing tumult the victimized student revealed what he had done explaining that he had resorted to poisoning the sandwich in order to establish the identity of the thief. Thereupon the rightful owner of the sandwich administrated an already prepared antidote to counter the effect of what otherwise would have been a lethal poison.</p>
<p>The students involved seem to have been non-Jews. However, many years later, a Jewish student who witnessed that episode, and who in the interim had become a physician in Israel as well as a participant in a periodic seminar conducted on behalf of physicians by Rabbi Yitzchak Zilberstein of Bnei Brak, asked Rabbi Zilberstein if the aggrieved student&#x2019;s conduct was justified in accordance with Jewish law. Surprisingly, as reported in the Israeli Torah journal, <italic>Pa&#x2019;amei Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>, no. 44 (Kislev 5760), Rabbi Zilberstein immediately responded, &#x201C;Not only is it permissible, the matter even involves a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah&#x0021;</italic>&#x201D;</p>
<p>In a one-line statement published in the Kislev 5760 issue of <italic>Pa&#x2019;amei Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>, R. Chaim Kanievsky gives a qualified endorsement to that position. Rabbi Kanievsky writes: &#x201C;It appears that there is a basis (<italic>yesh makom</italic>) for the words of my brother-in-law.&#x201D; Later, as reported by R. Elisha Mann, <italic>Derekh Si&#x1E25;ah</italic>, ed. Zevi Yaron (Bnei Brak, 5764), p. 371, Rabbi Kanievsky asserted that his opinion with regard to the case of the poisoned sandwich was solicited by Rabbi Zilberstein and that he had responded that the student was fully justified in poisoning the sandwich. Rabbi Kanievsky&#x2019;s statement is presented in conjunction with his reply to a similar inquiry: A thief gained entrance to an upper story of a dwelling by means of a rope. In order to prevent repeated burglary, may the owner of the house replace the rope with a weaker one that will snap and cause the burglar to fall and injure himself? Rabbi Kanievsky responded in the affirmative.</p>
<p>The same issue of <italic>Pa&#x2019;amei Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> as well as the following issue, no. 45 (Nisan 5760), contain a series of critiques of Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s ruling authored by R. Sinai Meir Frankel of Yavni&#x2019;el, R. Gedaliah Axelrod of Haifa, R. Mordecai Blinnov of France, R. Ya&#x2019;akov Gerneirer of Bnei Brak and R. Menasheh Klein of Brooklyn as well as two responses by Rabbi Zilberstein. A further critique by R. Gedaliah Rabinowitz of Jerusalem appears in the American Torah journal, <italic>Or Yisra&#x2019;el</italic>, vol. 6, no. 2 (Tevet 5761). Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s view is also published as an article appended to <italic>&#x1E24;akham Lev Yika&#x1E25; Mi&#x1E93;vot</italic>, authored by R. Eliezer Roth (Bnei Brak, 5661) and appears as well in his <italic>&#x1E24;ashukei &#x1E24;emed, Bava Kamma</italic>, p. 387 and in his <italic>Toratekha Sha&#x2019;ashu&#x2019;ai</italic>, no. 34. Discussions attributed to Rabbi Zilberstein of less dangerous methods of identifying and apprehending a miscreant are published in <italic>Ve-Ha&#x2019;arev Na</italic>, I, 438-440 and II, 427-430.</p>
<p>Although the rather bizarre fact pattern under discussion is unlikely to be replicated, the issues involved do have practical application in more usual situations. A classic example is the question of whether a householder who has reason to fear that his unoccupied premises may be burgled may booby-trap his house in order to protect his property by maiming or killing the miscreant. The crux of Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s position is that a person may do as he pleases in his own home, with his own knapsack or with his own sandwich. The thief or trespasser proceeds at his own risk. Consistent with this reasoning it follows that a person may store bleach or chlorine in a whisky bottle and need not be concerned lest a burglar read the label and consume the contents believing that the bottle contains whisky. Indeed, Rabbi Zilberstein asserts that such a course of action is justified even if the householder is aware of the fact that the would-be burglar has designs upon his whisky.</p>
<p>The basic point is reflected in the statement of the Gemara, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 47b, absolving a person who places poison before an animal from tort liability. The underlying principle is that there is no proximate cause on the part of the tortfeasor; the animal is responsible for its own death since &#x201C;it should not have eaten&#x201D; the poisoned substance. Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s critics object that, as is the case with regard to other instances of indirect cause of harm, the statement of the Gemara is limited to actionability in a human court but does not absolve a person who acts in that manner from responsibility &#x201C;according to the laws of Heaven.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Zilberstein counters that heavenly culpability is limited to placing poison before an animal in a place in which the animal has a right to be present; there is no similar heavenly liability if a person stores poison in his own backyard and it is consumed by a trespassing animal.<sup><xref rid="fn495">1</xref></sup> Moreover, contends Rabbi Zilberstein, a human is an intelligent being<sup><xref rid="fn496">2</xref></sup> and if he trespasses for purposes of theft the householder who causes him harm in this manner is not guilty even in the eyes of Heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn497">3</xref></sup> Certainly, he argues, a householder who posts a sign saying &#x201C;Beware of the Dog&#x201D; is entirely without guilt if a trespasser ignores the sign and is bitten. Rabbi Zilberstein regards the commandment &#x201C;You shalt not steal&#x201D; as sufficient warning. Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s basic position is that a person may do as he wishes in his own home and with his own property provided others are on notice with regard to possible harm that may befall them.<sup><xref rid="fn498">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zilberstein further cites an anecdote recorded in the Gemara, <italic>Yoma</italic> 83b. R. Judah and R. Jose deposited their purse with an innkeeper who later denied accepting the bailment. Subsequently, they succeeded in tricking the innkeeper&#x2019;s wife into accepting their contention that her husband had directed them to retrieve the purse from her. Upon becoming aware of their successful ploy, the enraged innkeeper killed his wife. Rabbi Zilberstein regards it as unthinkable that the two <italic>tanna&#x2019;im</italic> did not appreciate the possible consequences of their actions. Evidently, he concludes, R. Judah and R. Jose were entitled to do whatever might be necessary in order to prevent an act of theft against them while the innkeeper and his wife alone were responsible for any untoward result.</p>
<p>Rabbi Zilberstein finds more direct support for his position in a narrative recorded in Tractate <italic>Derekh Ere&#x1E93; Rabbah</italic>, chap. 5. On one occasion R. Joshua provided hospitality for a guest. After serving his guest food and drink, R. Joshua escorted him to the roof of his house where he had prepared a bed for the night. Fearing that the guest might abscond with some of his valuable possessions, R. Joshua removed the ladder leading from the roof to the ground. R. Joshua had correctly assessed his guest&#x2019;s intention. In the dead of night the guest wrapped R. Joshua&#x2019;s valuables in his cloak but, in attempting to descend from the roof, he fell and broke his neck.</p>
<p>That narrative is analyzed by R. Shlomoh Zalman Auerbach, <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Shlomoh</italic>, III, no. 105. Rabbi Auerbach declares that the anecdote does not at all establish that it is permissible to cause harm to a putative thief. Rabbi Auerbach asserts that R. Joshua&#x2019;s course of action was justified only because a prudent person would have observed the absence of the ladder. The purpose of removing the ladder was to prevent incipient theft, not to cause the thief to plunge to his death. The ladder was removed, not to cause physical harm to the thief, but to prevent him from absconding with his ill-gotten gains in the dark of night. The thief was unaware of the danger only because he acted with precipitous haste, a factor R. Joshua was not obliged to consider.<sup><xref rid="fn499">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zilberstein concedes the cogency of Rabbi Auerbach&#x2019;s analysis and hence effectively further restricts the ambit of his ruling in the case of the poisoned sandwich. Accepting the premise that only a deterrent that would not bring harm to a prudent person may be employed, Rabbi Zilberstein argues that, since the sandwich thief was proficient in chemistry, he should have tested the sandwich for the presence of a poison before partaking of his ill-gotten gains&#x0021; Rabbi Zilberstein rather implausibly equates chemical analysis for the presence of a deadly poison with ascertaining that a ladder is in place before stepping off a roof. A prudent person does not step off a roof without determining that it is safe to do so; unless a person has specific cause to feel threatened, testing food for the admixture of a poisonous substance is probably a manifestation of paranoia.</p>
<p>Rabbi Zilberstein agrees that, if the suspected thief is not trained in chemistry, it is forbidden to entice him to eat a poisoned substance. Accordingly, he rules that, in ordinary circumstances, it is forbidden to place poisoned candy in close proximity to valuables in anticipation that the thief will not only make off with the valuables but will steal and consume the sweets as well.</p>
<p>Rabbi Kanievsky, as reported in <italic>Derekh Si&#x1E25;ah</italic>, also cites the narrative involving R. Joshua recorded in <italic>Derekh Ere&#x1E93; Rabbah</italic> but apparently does not accept the limitation conceded by Rabbi Zilberstein. As noted earlier, Rabbi Kanievsky was presented with a situation in which a burglary victim wished to replace a strong rope with a much weaker one that would not support the weight of the burglar. Rabbi Kanievsky ruled that a substitution of that nature is permissible but failed to indicate that such license is limited to a situation in which the burglar would discern the substitution were he to have examined the rope.</p>
<p>R. Zevi Spitz, <italic>Mishpetei ha-Torah</italic> (Jerusalem, 5768), I, no. 79, similarly sanctions weakening the supporting pillars of a clothesline in order to prevent a thief from returning to burgle an upper story. Nevertheless, he forbids digging a deep pit in a courtyard and then camouflaging its opening so that a would-be thief would be trapped and injured by falling into the pit. Rabbi Spitz bases his latter ruling upon a statement recorded in the Gemara, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 15b, declaring that it is forbidden to maintain a ferocious dog or an infirm ladder in one&#x2019;s house. Such conduct is forbidden even if all family members and acquaintances are advised in advance of potential danger. The fear is that an innocent but unwary person intent upon no harm might be injured.<sup><xref rid="fn500">6</xref></sup> The case of Rabbi Joshua is readily distinguishable because, save for the thief <italic>cum</italic> guest who had been escorted to the roof, the roof was not generally in use and hence did not constitute a hazard. Rabbi Spitz permits only creation of a situation that will endanger no one other than a person whose intentions are malevolent. Innocent persons are unlikely to come to harm because the posts supporting a clothesline have been rendered unstable or because a weak rope has been substituted for a stronger one not customarily used for climbing. Weakened ropes or pillars do not constitute an inherent danger whereas a vicious dog and a ladder with loose rungs &#x2014; and a camouflaged pit &#x2014; are inherently dangerous.<sup><xref rid="fn501">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s statement to the effect that a person may with impunity place poison before an animal that has entered his property is contradicted by earlier decisors. R. Yair Chaim Bacharach, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>, no. 165, presents a report of an incident involving a merchant who engaged in the sale of various beans and seeds. Chickens belonging to a neighbor repeatedly swarmed into his place of business and helped themselves to the merchant&#x2019;s wares. The merchant repeatedly warned his neighbor that, should the latter fail to prevent continued trespass by his chickens, he, the merchant, would destroy the chickens. Finally, the merchant killed one of the marauding hens and was summoned by his neighbor to a <italic>din Torah</italic> before <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>. To the merchant&#x2019;s surprise and consternation, <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> ruled in favor of the owner of the chicken.</p>
<p><italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> rules that destruction of another person&#x2019;s animal is not warranted even if it occurs on one&#x2019;s own property and is designed to prevent ongoing damage of property. <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> does recognize that, under limited circumstances, a property owner faced with destruction of his property is entitled to avail himself of the remedy of <italic>avid inesh dina le-nafsheih</italic>, i.e., self-help, in order to prevent ongoing damage. Self-help, however, is available only in face of willful and intentional infliction of damage. Hence, in the case of damage caused by animals, self-help is available only pursuant to notice to the animal&#x2019;s master in the presence of witnesses.<sup><xref rid="fn502">8</xref></sup> It is evident from the ruling of <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 397:2, that notice is required<sup><xref rid="fn503">9</xref></sup> even if the damage is sustained because the animal has trespassed onto the property of the victim. The identical rule should apply to placing poison before a marauding animal although, since placing poison before an animal is regarded as only an indirect cause of the animal&#x2019;s death, liability in such instances would be limited to punishment &#x201C;at the hands of Heaven.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The propriety of setting out poison for the purpose of killing trespassing animals that cause property damage is addressed directly by R. Shalom Mordecai Schwadron, <italic>Teshuvot Maharsham</italic>, IV, no. 140. Maharsham cites <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 397:2 and <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>, no. 165, in ruling that self-help is not sanctioned in such cases. Somewhat surprisingly, he does not add that self-help in the form of slaughter of an animal raised for its meat is permitted upon prior notice. Maharsham considers and rejects his interlocutor&#x2019;s contention that such action may be appropriate provided it is carried out within the confines of the aggrieved party&#x2019;s own property.<sup><xref rid="fn504">10</xref></sup></p>
<h1>II. <italic>Culpability in Common Law</italic></h1>
<p>There is a close parallel to Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s opinion in the case of the poisoned sandwich and two classic decisions of a British court in which a distinction is made with regard to whether or not the victim was given notice. Trespassing for the purpose of hunting game seems to have been common in nineteenth-century England. Landowners responded by setting up &#x201C;spring-guns&#x201D; that were designed to shoot an intruder who tripped a wire. In <italic>Ilott</italic> v. <italic>Wilkes</italic>, 3 Barn. &#x0026; Ald. 304, decided in 1820, the plaintiff was gathering nuts on the land of the defendant upon which the latter had concealed nine or ten spring-guns. The court refused to allow recovery for damages because the plaintiff had notice of the presence of guns in the wood, albeit not of their location. Just five years later, in <italic>Bird</italic> v. <italic>Holbrook</italic>, 4 Bing. 628, 130 Eng. Rep. 911 (1825), the same court found a defendant liable for injuries caused to an innocent intruder intent upon retrieving a straying bird, but only because the defendant failed to give notice of the danger.</p>
<p>That distinction was rejected by an American court in <italic>Johnson</italic> v. <italic>Patterson</italic>, 14 Conn. 1, 1840 WL 334 (Conn), 33 Am. Dec. 96. With notice, it had been argued, the trespasser, having full knowledge of the danger, assumes the risk voluntarily and hence must be deemed to have personally inflicted the injury on himself. The court dismissed that argument as applied to the taking of human life declaring: &#x201C;The man who should furnish suicides with means of self-destruction, would justly be considered as partaking of the crime of homicide, however voluntarily or rashly they were bent on its perpetration.&#x201D; In a concurring opinion in <italic>Ilott</italic>, one of the justices of the British court justified the use of spring-guns on the grounds that &#x201C;If you do not allow the men of landed estates to preserve their game, you will not prevail upon them to reside in the country. Their poor neighbors will then lose their protection and kind offices; and the government, the support that it derives from an independent, enlightened and unpaid magistracy.&#x201D; Quite understandably the <italic>Johnson</italic> court found little to commend in that rationale as applied to American society.<sup><xref rid="fn505">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, in 1971, in <italic>Katko</italic> v. <italic>Briney</italic>, 183 N. W.2d 657, 47 A.L.R.3d 624, the Supreme Court of Iowa affirmed an award in an action for damages resulting from injuries suffered by the plaintiff when he triggered a spring-gun placed in an uninhabited farm house. The court affirmed the principle that use of reasonable force in protection of property is permissible but that one may not use force that will result in the taking of a human life or that will inflict great bodily injury. Force of that nature, the court reiterated, is justified only if the trespasser was committing a felony of violence or if the trespasser was endangering human life.<sup><xref rid="fn506">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even when employed to prevent danger to human life, only reasonable force may be used. The reasonableness of the force used is usually a question of fact for a jury to determine. Force may be employed in defense of property but the force used must be of a kind appropriate to the defense of the property. Since the law places a higher value upon human safety than upon mere rights in property, it is the accepted rule that there is no privilege to use any force calculated to cause death or serious bodily injury to repel the threat to land or chattels<sup><xref rid="fn507">13</xref></sup> unless there is also a concomitant threat to the defendant&#x2019;s personal safety of a gravity sufficient to justify self-defense.</p>
<p>Jewish law permits use of deadly force by a householder against a burglar on the basis of the consideration that when the householder attempts to resist in defending hearth and home the burglar will use deadly force against him. Accordingly, the burglar, or <italic>ba be-ma&#x1E25;teret</italic>, is deemed to be a &#x201C;pursuer&#x201D; and the law of <italic>rodef</italic> applies. For obvious reasons that principle cannot be applied to protection of unoccupied premises or to an endeavor designed solely to identify or apprehend a perpetrator no longer intent upon burglary since in such cases there is no conceivable threat to innocent life.<sup><xref rid="fn508">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus it is evident that, although American courts have abandoned the earlier doctrine, the position of Rabbi Zilberstein and Rabbi Kanievsky permitting booby-trapping one&#x2019;s premises provided that prior notice is given of the potential hazard is entirely consistent with the common law position announced in <italic>Ilott</italic> and in <italic>Bird</italic>.</p>
<p>Liability for poisoning in order to prevent theft was considered by the Supreme Court of Mississippi in a 1958 decision, <italic>Bruister v. Hanly</italic> 233 Miss. 527, 102 So.2d 806. A farmer who suffered losses caused by trespassing cattle placed poison in little piles of oats on his premises with intent to injure or kill the marauding animals. The court held that a person who places poisoned food on his premises with intention to injure or kill animals trespassing on his land is liable for any resultant injury to, or loss of, such animals. That basic rule is consistent with Halakhah save for the fact that, since the harm was in the form of <italic>gerama</italic>, Halakhah would assign culpability only at the hands of Heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn509">15</xref></sup> Citing <italic>Johnson</italic>, the court further found that notifying the owner of the animals of his intention to place poisoned food on his premises would not exonerate the farmer. Common law would have permitted such a course of action upon prior notice. Again, although Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s opinion is at variance with the decision in <italic>Bruister</italic>, his view is consistent with the common law position.<sup><xref rid="fn510">16</xref></sup></p>
<h1>III. <italic>The Duty of Rescue</italic></h1>
<p>Nevertheless, Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s ruling is not as far-reaching as it might appear to be. Granted that a person may act as he wishes with his own possessions, nevertheless, unlike common law, the commandment &#x201C;You shall not stand idly by the blood of your fellow&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:16) serves to impose a duty of rescue and mandates that a person not allow the life of another to become forfeit. As codified by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 4:12, and <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 425:5, Leviticus 19:16 imposes a duty of rescue even with regard to a person who sins in the course of seeking to gratify lust or appetite. Certainly, one may not create a danger and allow a person to succumb if there is an obligation to rescue the victim from that danger. That consideration would seem to preclude any attempt to poison a putative thief.</p>
<p>However, in positing an exception to the obligation of rescue, <italic>Pit&#x1E25;ei Teshuvah</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 251:1, asserts that, according to <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, there is no duty to preserve the life of a notorious thief. As evident from the ruling of <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 251:2, there is certainly no obligation to rescue a repeated wanton and habitual transgressor. Although Rema, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 251:2, rules that ransom of a transgressor &#x201C;<italic>le-tei&#x2019;avon</italic>,&#x201D; i.e., one who repeatedly transgresses for pleasure or benefit, is discretionary, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>, no. 139, rules that efforts must be made to secure the reprieve of a convicted thief from execution since his transgressions were <italic>le-tei&#x2019;avon</italic>, i.e., born of avarice rather than of wanton disregard of the law. Accordingly, Rabbi Zilberstein concedes that, for example, one should not tempt a burglar by placing poisoned candy in a safe or in close proximity to valuables in order to punish the malfeasor, particularly since there is no evidence that the putative burglar has stolen property in the past and has thereby acquired the status of a <italic>mumar</italic> or habitual trangressor.<sup><xref rid="fn511">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zilberstein asserts that the sandwich thief acted, not because of hunger or out of a desire to satisfy an appetite stimulated by sight of the sandwich, but out of sheer maliciousness and, having done so repeatedly, the thief has acquired the status of a <italic>mumar le-hakh&#x2019;is</italic>, i.e., of a habitual, wanton transgressor rather than of a person who trespasses for the purpose of enjoying a pleasure or benefit. Despite that contention, it is far from clear that the thief did not act out of mixed motivation: he may also have found the victim&#x2019;s sandwiches particularly tasty or he may well have similarly coveted sandwiches belonging to others but have felt constrained not to steal from close friends or colleagues.</p>
<p>Moreover, Rabbi Zilberstein does not establish that the pleasure derived from taunting or holding up another person to ridicule, perverse as that pleasure may be, fails to constitute a &#x201C;benefit&#x201D; of a nature that serves to remove the act from the category of <italic>le-tei&#x2019;avon</italic>. Indeed, a statement found in <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>, no. 146, cited by <italic>Pit&#x1E25;ei Teshuvah</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 251:1, supports the opposite conclusion. <italic>&#x1E24;avvot</italic> <italic>Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> describes a person who had committed homicide as a transgressor <italic>le-tei&#x2019;avon</italic> on the grounds that the person acted as he did in order to assuage his evil nature. <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> regards giving vent to anger as a form of &#x201C;pleasure,&#x201D; albeit an evil pleasure. Surely, making sport of a hapless person, perverse as it may be, is no less a pleasure than acting out pent-up aggression.</p>
<p>Presumably, Rabbi Zilberstein would also maintain that, even when there is no physical danger to the potential victim of further theft, it is nevertheless permissible to create a potentially lethal danger directed against a malevolent and habitual thief provided that the thief is given actual prior notice of an existing danger. It seems reasonable to assume that the imprudence inherent in ignoring such notice is at least as great as, and presumably greater than, the imprudence of not testing a sandwich for poison.</p>
<p>Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s position is not inconsistent with the normative view regarding the rescue of a person intent upon committing suicide. When an intention to commit suicide is manifest such intention must be thwarted<sup><xref rid="fn512">18</xref></sup> but, unless there is evidence to that effect, it may be presumed that a rational person will seek to avoid harm to himself. Hence, according to Rabbi Zilberstein, license to create a hazard designed to serve as a deterrent is not incompatible with a duty of rescue.</p>
<h1>IV. <italic>&#x201C;</italic>Hal&#x2019;itehu la-Rasha &#x2014; <italic>Gorge The Wicked&#x201D;</italic></h1>
<p>Rabbi Zilberstein asserts not only that, as a matter of normative law, a person may do as he wishes within his own property but that he need not be concerned even in a moral sense with regard to potential harm that may befall a miscreant. Quite to the contrary, he asserts, any harm that is occasioned is to be welcomed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;<italic>Hal&#x2019;itehu<sup><xref rid="fn513">19</xref></sup> la-rasha ve-yamot<sup><xref rid="fn514">20</xref></sup></italic> &#x2013; Gorge the wicked and let him die&#x201D; is formulated as a principle of comportment by the Gemara, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 69a, with regard to thieves who steal fruit yielded by a sapling within the first four years after it has been planted. The fruit of the first three years is entirely forbidden as <italic>orlah</italic>; the fruit that grows during the fourth year, known as <italic>neta reva&#x2019;i</italic>, or, in the case of grapes, as <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic>, must either be transported to Jerusalem and consumed within the walls of the city or redeemed by exchanging the fruit for coins which must then be expended for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Thieves who steal fruit do not necessarily ignore other prohibitions. However, even if, in general, they would be concerned not knowingly to transgress the prohibition against consuming <italic>neta reva&#x2019;i</italic> outside of Jerusalem, thieves are unlikely to be aware of the restricted status of the fruit they have appropriated to themselves. The rightful owners might readily mitigate the severity of the transgression committed by the thieves by expeditiously &#x201C;redeeming&#x201D; the fruit, i.e., by themselves transferring the sanctity of the fruit to coins so that the thieves would be spared the transgression of eating <italic>neta reva&#x2019;i</italic> outside of Jerusalem. Alternatively, they might simply post a notice indicating the restricted nature of the fruit. Yet they are not required to do so. Indeed, Me&#x2019;iri, in his commentary <italic>ad locum</italic>, indicates that a potential victim of theft is advised not to provide any indication that the coveted object is a forbidden foodstuff. Rather than seeking to take measures that would cause the putative thief to desist from compounding his infractions, declares Me&#x2019;iri, &#x201C;it is preferable (<italic>mutav</italic>)&#x201D; to allow the culprit to become mired in more serious transgression in order to hasten heavenly punishment. R. Solomon Sirillo, known as Rash Sirillo, in his commentary on the Palestinian Talmud, <italic>Dem&#x2019;ai</italic> 3:5, similarly comments, &#x201C;&#x2026;the more severe the transgression the better, so that [the malfeasor] will die speedily.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The statements of Me&#x2019;iri and Rash Sirillo to the contrary, the absence of a binding obligation to prevent a transgressor from sinning is not at all the same as discouragement of a voluntary undertaking of such a course of action. Moreover, there is reason to assume that, in disagreement with Me&#x2019;iri and Rash Sirillo, such a distinction would be made by other early-day authorities.</p>
<p>The principle &#x201C;<italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>&#x201D; is itself the subject of controversy. The source quoted in <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 69a as announcing that principle is the Mishnah, <italic>Ma&#x2019;aser Sheni</italic> 5:1, that describes how during the sabbatical year when all produce is in effect <italic>res nullius</italic>, it was customary for landowners to mark vineyards in which vines bearing grapes that were <italic>orlah</italic> were present with pulverized pottery or potsherds so that those grapes would be eschewed and to mark vineyards in which the yield was <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> with clods of earth so that any person who legitimately helped himself to such fruit would be aware of its restricted nature. As recorded in the Palestinian Talmud&#x2019;s version of the Mishnah and as cited in <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 69a, R. Shimon ben Gamliel is quoted as declaring that placement of such markers is required only during the sabbatical year when produce is ownerless; however, during other years of the seven-year cycle, when the person helping himself to grapes in another person&#x2019;s vineyard is a simple thief, the applicable principle is &#x201C;Gorge the wicked and let him die.&#x201D; The Mishnah, however, concludes with the citation of a contrary practice attributed to a group known as &#x201C;the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic>,&#x201D; i.e., &#x201C;modest&#x201D; or &#x201C;virtuous&#x201D; individuals, who did not simply mark the vineyard to warn against transgression but set aside their own funds and declared that any <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> taken from the vineyard be redeemed out of those designated funds.</p>
<p>Rambam, in his <italic>Commentary on the Mishnah</italic>, <italic>ad locum</italic>, as well as in <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;aser Sheni</italic> 9:7, followed by R. Ovadiah of Bartenura, <italic>Ma&#x2019;aser Sheni</italic> 5:1, and by one opinion cited by Me&#x2019;iri, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 69a, understand the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> as having engaged in that practice only during the sabbatical year, i.e., when picking fruit on land belonging to another did not constitute theft. If so, there is no reason to conclude that the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> rejected the principle <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>; quite to the contrary, during the balance of the seven-year cycle, during which time picking fruit belonging to another person constituted theft, the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> refrained from mitigating the thieves&#x2019; transgression because they, too, recognized and accepted the principle <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Tosafot</italic>, in disagreement with Rambam, maintain that redemption of <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> grown during the sabbatical year is entirely unnecessary. Hence, consistent with that position, <italic>Tosafot</italic> found it inconceivable that the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> redeemed <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> during the sabbatical year. Accordingly, <italic>Tosafot</italic> explain the conduct of the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> in a manner diametrically opposed to that of Rambam in asserting that the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> engaged in that practice only in years other than the sabbatical year. R. Akiva Eger, <italic>Tosafot R. Akiva Eger</italic>, <italic>Ma&#x2019;aser Sheni</italic> 5:1, advances yet a third interpretation of the conduct of the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> in assuming that the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> acted in the manner described by the Mishnah each and every year of the seven-year cycle. According to the interpretations of <italic>Tosafot</italic> and R. Akiva Eger, the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> clearly disagreed with R. Shimon ben Gamliel and did not at all subscribe to the principle of &#x201C;gorge the wicked.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn515">21</xref></sup> Nevertheless, on the basis of the canon formulated by the Gemara, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 69a, the halakhah is in accordance with R. Shimon ben Gamliel.<sup><xref rid="fn516">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, recognition that the normative rule follows the opinion of R. Shimon ben Gamliel rather than the practice of the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> does not necessarily entail acceptance of the opinion of Me&#x2019;iri and Rash Sirillo to the effect that <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> constitutes a mandated mode of comportment. Rashi, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 69a, describes the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> as &#x201C;pietists who wish to preserve every person from sin.&#x201D; It would seem that in defining the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> as &#x201C;pietists,&#x201D; in contradistinction to R. Shimon ben Gamliel who did not emulate their practice, Rashi asserts that there is no substantive controversy between the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> and R. Shimon ben Gamliel but that the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> conducted themselves in a manner beyond that required by the letter of the law. If so &#x2014; and if Rashi understood the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> as having acted as they did during years in which picking fruit in other persons&#x2019; fields would constitute thievery &#x2014; it follows that Rashi understood that, even for R. Shimon ben Gamliel, <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> is not an expression of a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> or even of a preferred policy. However, if Rashi understood the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> as having comported themselves in that manner only during the sabbatical year whereas in other years they conformed with R. Shimon ben Gamliel&#x2019;s dictum, there is no evidence that Rashi disagrees with Me&#x2019;iri and Rash Sirillo.<sup><xref rid="fn517">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>At least one contemporary authority, R. Ya&#x2019;akov Breisch, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;elkat Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>, II, no. 16, apparently understands <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> as merely sanctioning non-intervention rather than as a statement of affirmative encouragement of non-intervention. <italic>&#x1E24;elkat Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> states, &#x201C;Obviously, even for R. Shimon ben Gamliel there is no prohibition against marking [<italic>kerem</italic> <italic>reva&#x2019;i</italic>],&#x201D; i.e., <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> serves only to obviate an <italic>obligation</italic> to preserve the transgressor from sin but does not give rise to a prohibition or policy consideration against doing so.<sup><xref rid="fn518">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Rabbi Zilberstein cites both Me&#x2019;iri and Rash Sirillo in support of his assertion that indirectly causing the demise of the thief is not only permitted but constitutes a &#x201C;<italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>&#x201D; as well. In actuality, the most that can be inferred from the words of those commentators is that the death of such a person is a <italic>desideratum</italic>. It would be reading far too much into their comments to conclude that one who causes the death of a wicked person has actually fulfilled a divine command for which he is entitled to heavenly reward. Moreover, recognition of a particular result as a <italic>desideratum</italic> is not at all inconsistent with a prohibition against seeking even indirectly to obtain that result. <italic>Hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>, when that principle applies, certainly serves to negate an otherwise binding obligation to prevent transgression. At the very most, it might be argued that the malfeasor&#x2019;s transgression may even be abetted in some way. The goal, even according to Me&#x2019;iri and Rash Sirillo, is simply to hasten <italic>divine</italic> retribution; there is no evidence that the principle <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> serves to cancel the prohibition against overtly causing this-worldly harm to a human being even if the harm is caused only indirectly. Indeed, the examples of invocation of <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> in classic responsa are uniformly limited to permitting transgression to occur, not as justification for causing physical harm.</p>
<p>For example, R. David ibn Zimra, <italic>Teshuvot Radvaz</italic>, IV, no. 1,223, (152) addresses a situation involving a defendant who was ordered to swear a solemn oath affirming that he did not owe a sum of money and who was quite prepared to swear to that effect. The claimant, knowing that the oath would be false, queried whether he should allow the defendant to swear falsely or whether he should withdraw his claim. Radvaz responded that the claimant was under no obligation<sup><xref rid="fn519">25</xref></sup> to absolve the defendant from the required oath.<sup><xref rid="fn520">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The same author, <italic>Teshuvot Radvaz</italic>, IV, no. 1,357 (286) responded in a similar vein to another query as well. A divorce was executed on behalf of a woman accused of adultery on the condition that the wife not marry her paramour. It became evident that, despite the condition, the couple intended to marry with the result that the <italic>get</italic> would be nullified retroactively. Radvaz was asked whether it would be appropriate for the first husband to execute a second, unconditional divorce in order to preserve the couple from the sin of adultery. Radvaz responded by noting that, even if she were properly divorced by means of a second, unconditional <italic>get</italic>, the wife would remain forbidden to her paramour.<sup><xref rid="fn521">27</xref></sup> Although the infraction of consorting with a person with whom one has had a previous adulterous liaison is far less severe than adultery itself, nevertheless, declares Radvaz, the principle &#x201C;gorge the wicked&#x201D; obviates any need to mitigate the transgression.<sup><xref rid="fn522">28</xref></sup> Radvaz adds a tentative comment (<italic>karov ani lomar</italic>) to the effect that even in the absence of suspected adultery no attempt should be made to regularize the union &#x201C;to satisfy the wicked&#x201D; since, even if there was no prior adultery, the parties transgressed by entering into a civil marriage.<sup><xref rid="fn523">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>In yet a third responsum, <italic>Teshuvot</italic> <italic>Radvaz</italic>, III, no. 893, Radvaz refused to sanction a religious marriage ceremony of behalf of an already civilly married couple in a situation in which the partners were merely suspected of being engaged in a previous adulterous relationship.</p>
<h1>V. <italic>Parameters of the Principle</italic></h1>
<p>Assuming that <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> establishes a &#x201C;<italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>&#x201D; of some type, the ambit of that concept is rather limited. R. Chaim Yair Bacharach, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>, no. 142, expresses bewilderment with regard to entertainment of the principle &#x201C;gorge the wicked,&#x201D; even as a discretionary principle, in light of the normative halakhic obligation to prevent a fellow Jew from committing any transgression. The fact that a person will commit one transgression does not relieve fellow Jews from their obligation to prevent him from another transgression. <sup><xref rid="fn524">30</xref></sup> Moreover, contends <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>, a would-be thief will not necessarily also transgress the prohibition against consuming <italic>orlah</italic> or <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic>. Hence, if made aware of the status of the grapes, he may well refrain from stealing the grapes and thus both transgressions will have been prevented. <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> leaves the problem unresolved and eloquently expresses his perplexity in declaring that &#x201C;whoever will cure my sickness in this regard shall be deemed a skilled physician.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn525">31</xref></sup></p>
<h3>1. Bet Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</h3>
<p>R. Isaac Schmelkes, <italic>Teshuvot Bet Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 29, sec. 4, accepts the underlying thesis dismissed by <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>, <italic>viz</italic>., that <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> effectively overrides obligations of surety and admonition. <italic>Bet Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> understands <italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 151:6, as ruling that there is no obligation to prevent a putative evildoer from intentional transgression.<sup><xref rid="fn526">32</xref></sup> According to that understanding, the obligations of surety and admonition are limited to unintentional transgression. <italic>Bet Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> defends <italic>Shakh</italic> against those who took issue with his position by asserting that indeed <italic>Shakh</italic> derived his position from the principle of <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> which he understood as establishing that there is no obligation to prevent the sin of a person intent upon willful transgression.<sup><xref rid="fn527">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other authorities do not go as far as <italic>Bet Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> in asserting a total negation of responsibility <italic>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</italic> willful transgressors. Instead, they resolve the problem voiced by <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> by asserting that <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> serves to define the limits of the obligations of suretyship and admonition and to carve out an exception to those duties.<sup><xref rid="fn528">34</xref></sup></p>
<h3>2. Tuv Ta&#x2019;am va-Da&#x2019;at <italic>and Mahari Perla</italic></h3>
<p>R. Shlomoh Kluger, <italic>Teshuvot Tuv Ta&#x2019;am va-Da&#x2019;at</italic>, no. 174, declares that the principle <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> applies only if, even after intervention, the miscreant is left in a situation in which he will incur at least one infraction even though a second transgression is obviated; however, asserts <italic>Tuv Ta&#x2019;am va-Da&#x2019;at</italic>, <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> is not applicable in circumstances in which all infractions can be prevented.<sup><xref rid="fn529">35</xref></sup> <italic>Tuv Ta&#x2019;am va-Da&#x2019;at</italic> explains that there is no obligation to prevent a person who is &#x201C;wicked at that hour&#x201D; from further transgression, i.e., there is no obligation to prevent transgression if the would-be sinner will remain &#x201C;wicked&#x201D; even though, in some sense, his transgression will have been mitigated. However, if the putative transgressor can be prevented entirely from sinning he is not &#x201C;wicked at that hour,&#x201D; i.e., he will not at all become a transgressor, and hence measures must be taken to preserve his innocence by sparing him from transgression.<sup><xref rid="fn530">36</xref></sup> Those comments are apparently designed to resolve, at least in part, the question posed by <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>. The obligation of <italic>arvut</italic>, according to <italic>Tuv Ta&#x2019;am va-Da&#x2019;at</italic>, exists only if a would-be transgressor can be prevented from becoming &#x201C;wicked at that hour&#x201D; but does not mandate diminishing the severity of a wicked person&#x2019;s sin.</p>
<p>A similar thesis, but one that reflects a somewhat different analysis of the obligation of suretyship, is developed by R. Yerucham Perla, known as Mahari Perla, in his commentary on R. Sa&#x2019;adia Ga&#x2019;on&#x2019;s <italic>Sefer ha-Mi&#x1E93;vot</italic>, III, <italic>Minyan Shishim ve-&#x1E24;amesh ha-Parshiyot</italic>, <italic>Parashah</italic> 57, s.v. <italic>ve-hineh yadana</italic>, and is explicitly presented as a resolution of the perplexity expressed by <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>.</p>
<p>Mahari Perla declares that <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> does not serve to sanction rendering active assistance to a would-be transgressor; hence the issue of placing a stumbling-block before the blind does not arise. The sole issue, then, is the obligation of suretyship that requires prevention of sin on the part of a fellow Jew.</p>
<p>The obligation of suretyship is binding only in situations in which a person has it within his power to prevent transgression. Ordinarily, the owner of a vineyard cannot prevent the theft of his grapes and, accordingly, he has no obligation of suretyship with regard to that infraction. Mahari Perla opines that the obligation of suretyship is limited to situations in which it is within a person&#x2019;s power to prevent all taint of sin. Accordingly, R. Shimon ben Gamliel maintains that no indication need be made regarding the status of the fruit as <italic>orlah</italic> or as <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> other than during the sabbatical year. During that year the owner of the vineyard can prevent the only attendant transgression, i.e., <italic>orlah</italic> or <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic>. During other years, trespassers who pick grapes are also guilty of theft; since that infraction cannot be obviated, asserts Mahari Perla, there is no further obligation of suretyship.<sup><xref rid="fn531">37</xref></sup></p>
<h3>3. Ein Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</h3>
<p>R. Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor, <italic>Ein Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>, I, no. 8, resolves the issue raised by <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> but in doing so he severely limits the ambit of the principle <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>. <italic>Ein Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> observes that Jews are parties to a covenantal relationship requiring each person to serve as a surety for observance of the commandments by all others. The principle of suretyship, or <italic>arvut</italic>, is limited to transgressions of which one has knowledge; there is no responsibility, and hence no onus of suretyship, regarding the transgression of a fellow Jew of which one has no knowledge. The latter are in the category of <italic>nistarot</italic>, i.e., &#x201C;concealed&#x201D; or secret things, that are depicted in Deuteronomy 29:28 as matters to be dealt with solely by God. Applying that thesis to the paradigm case of <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>, <italic>viz</italic>., the situation described in <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 69a, <italic>Ein Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> asserts that, since the identity of the individuals who steal grapes from the vineyard is unknown, those infractions are &#x201C;concealed&#x201D; and hence there is no obligation to prevent transgression by such individuals.<sup><xref rid="fn532">38</xref></sup></p>
<h3>4. <italic>Passive Non-Prevention vs. Active Assistance</italic></h3>
<p><italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>, in his previously cited responsum, further distinguishes between passive non-prevention of transgression and active &#x201C;entrapment.&#x201D; The former may be justified, at least in some circumstances, on the basis of <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>; the latter can never be sanctioned. In <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>&#x2019;s day, some villagers adopted the practice of drying or smoking hindquarters not eaten by Jews as well as animals that, upon slaughter, were found to be non-kosher so that the meat could be sold to non-Jews over a period of time without flooding the market and depressing the value of meat. <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> was asked if it was proper for those Jews to retain non-kosher meat in their possession for an extended period of time because of a concern that itinerant guests might steal and later consume the non-kosher meat. <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> rules that it is improper to do so since such a practice would compound the transgression of persons who might misappropriate the meat. Responding to the contention that the principle <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu larasha</italic> would render the practice innocuous, <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> declares that the principle &#x201C;gorge the wicked&#x201D; serves to permit non-intervention but cannot be invoked to sanction active placement of a stumbling-block.<sup><xref rid="fn533">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Poisoning a sandwich is certainly no less an act of overt placement of a stumbling-block before the blind than the act of preserving and retaining non-kosher meat on one&#x2019;s premises. Accordingly, it would follow that the student&#x2019;s conduct in this matter would not have been sanctioned by <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn534">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>The distinction between active assistance and passive non-intervention in this context emerges from what would otherwise be a contradictory ruling of the Mishnah, <italic>Demai</italic> 3:5, as interpreted by the Palestinian Talmud, and cited by R. Elijah of Vilna in a gloss appended to the commentary of Rabbenu Shimshon, <italic>ad locum</italic>. Apparently, in the days of the Mishnah, guests at an inn customarily brought their own flour and the like to be baked or cooked on their behalf by the proprietress. Innkeepers were prone to illicit substitution of their own ingredients for those of their guests. As a result, a problem arose because many people were not meticulous with regard to separation of tithes. The Mishnah rules that the guest must tithe both the foodstuffs he delivers to the proprietress as well as the food he receives in return. The guest may not simply tithe the food after it has been returned to him because the proprietor may have been lax in that regard but must also tithe any food entrusted to the proprietor because of a fear that a portion of the raw ingredients he provided to his host may have been misappropriated and, if consumed by the innkeeper, will result in a violation of the laws of tithing. Therefore, the guest must tithe before transferring those ingredients to the proprietor lest he be culpable for causing transgression. R. Jose disagrees and commenting, &#x201C;we are not responsible for scoundrels,&#x201D; rules that the guests need tithe only once, <italic>viz</italic>., before partaking of the food returned to him by the proprietress.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Talmud comments that R. Shimon ben Gamliel, the author of the dictum &#x201C;<italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha,</italic>&#x201D; need not necessarily accede to the position of R. Jose. In other words, it is entirely consistent to rule that <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> need not be identified in order to spare a thief from transgression but at the same time to rule that untithed food may not be placed in the hands of a person who may misappropriate such food and incur the transgression of consuming untithed food. Indeed, Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;aser Sheni</italic> 9:7, rules in accordance with R. Shimon ben Gamliel that markers indicating that grapes are <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> need be set out only during the sabbatical years whereas in <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;aser</italic> 11:12 Rambam rules contrary to the opinion of R. Jose. <sup><xref rid="fn535">41</xref></sup> In a succinct comment, <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> explains that there is no contradiction between those rulings because &#x201C;since [the guest] actively gives her [the foodstuff] it is more severe,&#x201D; i.e., <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> serves to sanction passive non-intervention but not active assistance.<sup><xref rid="fn536">42</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, <italic>Dem&#x2019;ai</italic> 8:9, s.v. <italic>ve-amri</italic>, seems to draw a distinction identical to that of <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>. <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> comments that allowing thieves to steal fruit does not constitute &#x201C;placing a stumbling block&#x201D; before them since the act is intrinsically forbidden and they have not been &#x201C;invited&#x201D; to transgress by the owner of the orchard. However, declares <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, any overt act that serves to entice or enable additional transgression is forbidden.</p>
<p><italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> concludes his comments by stating that the term &#x201C;gorge the wicked&#x201D; should not be understood literally; rather, it means only that &#x201C;you are not required to [be concerned] with regard to his action and to engage in his rescue.&#x201D; Those comments certainly imply that any overt act likely to cause harm, spiritual or temporal, is forbidden.</p>
<p>The distinction regarding responsibility <italic>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</italic> those who steal <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> and <italic>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</italic> the proprietress who does not tithe is that in the situation involving theft of <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> the additional transgression results from passive failure to provide a warning concerning the restricted nature of the coveted fruit whereas the transgression of the proprietress could not occur save for the overt act of her guest in actively providing the opportunity for sin. The conclusion to be drawn is obvious: <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> does not permit an overt act leading to spiritual harm. Hence, contrary to the view of Rabbi Zilberstein, it cannot be invoked as license for an overt act designed to cause physical harm. The cryptic dictum of the Palestinian Talmud cited by R. Elijah of Vilna, &#x201C;It is not the wont of a scholar to cause an unperfected matter to issue from his hand,&#x201D; is interpreted by <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> as reflecting the distinction between overt and passive acts rather than a formulation of a normative rule.<sup><xref rid="fn537">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, it seems to this writer that there is a more obvious explanation that will reconcile the ruling of R. Jose with the principle of <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> and which also reflects the more obvious meaning of the dictum &#x201C;A scholar does not cause an unperfected matter to issue from his hand.&#x201D; Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;aser</italic> 11:12, rules that one must tithe the foodstuffs delivered to the proprietress &#x201C;so that there will be no misfortune <italic>to others</italic> (emphasis added).&#x201D; The concern, apparently, is not that the proprietress might consume untithed produce; <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> might well obviate that concern. The proprietress, however, bakes and cooks on behalf of other guests of the inn as well. The concern, as expressed by Rambam, is for <italic>others</italic>, i.e., she is to be suspected of substituting untithed food for food entrusted to her by other guests and hence of serving <italic>them</italic> untithed food.<sup><xref rid="fn538">44</xref></sup> According to this understanding, the distinction is not predicated upon general halakhic concerns of surety or of creation of a stumbling block but upon the much narrower principle that a scholar does not cause unsuspecting persons to sin by allowing &#x201C;an unperfected matter to issue from his hand.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn539">45</xref></sup></p>
<h1>V. <italic>An Alternative Thesis</italic></h1>
<p>The distinction drawn by <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> and <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic> between passive facilitation and an overt act providing an opportunity for transgression is not as obvious as it may appear. Such a distinction may or may not exist with regard to the prohibition against placing a stumbling block before the blind.<sup><xref rid="fn540">46</xref></sup> The cogency of entertaining such a distinction arises from the language in which the prohibition is couched, <italic>viz</italic>., &#x201C;you shall not place.&#x201D; That terminology ostensibly restrains only overt action. However, the duty of admonition and the obligation to prevent transgression stemming from the more encompassing covenental obligation of suretyship do not simply forbid action but command performance. Such duties cannot be avoided on the plea that one has limited oneself to mere non-intervention. Moreover, as remarked earlier, the aphorism employed by the Palestinian Talmud, &#x201C;A scholar does not allow an unperfected matter to emerge from his hands,&#x201D; certainly does not resonate as a code phrase for distinguishing between an overt act and passive non-intervention. More basically, despite the valiant efforts of latter-day authorities to resolve <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>&#x2019;s principal concern, <italic>viz</italic>., why the obligation to prevent transgression should be cancelled because of <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>, remains perplexing.</p>
<p><italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> clearly maintains that it is forbidden to create a &#x201C;stumbling block&#x201D; in one&#x2019;s own domain even if the only person likely to &#x201C;stumble&#x201D; is a person engaged in an illicit act. That position is in sharp contrast to the view of <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, III, no. 90, who asserts that a person may engage in normal activities without concern that others may &#x201C;stumble&#x201D; in attempting to reap vicarious benefit. <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> formulates that thesis in explaining why it is permitted to teach Gemara in the vernacular through the medium of a radio program despite the possibility that non-Jews who are forbidden to study the Oral Law may also tune in to the program.</p>
<p><italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> raises an objection to his own position in pointing out that the conduct of the owner of a vineyard in allowing <italic>orlah</italic> and <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> to grow represents normal activity conducted on his own premises. If so, he queries, why is it necessary to mark <italic>orlah</italic> and <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> in order to prevent transgression? <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> responds by stating that during the sabbatical year the landowner has either explicitly or constructively invited all and sundry to partake of produce growing on his land. Such an invitation, he maintains, is tantamount to actively enticing people to transgress and therefore constitutes placing a stumbling block before them. <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> recognizes that the first opinion recorded in the Mishnah requiring that <italic>orlah</italic> and <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> be marked as such every year &#x2014; when surely no such invitation is extended &#x2014; is not explained by his thesis. <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic> endeavors to explain that opinion in a rather vague and imprecise way but he is basically unconcerned with explaining that view since the normative rule is in accordance with the position of R. Shimon ben Gamliel. Be that as it may, and putting aside other considerations germane to the case of radio broadcasts,<sup><xref rid="fn541">47</xref></sup> <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>&#x2019;s basic thesis is at variance from the ruling of <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>.</p>
<p>The difficulty, both with regard to the position of R. Shimon ben Gamliel and of the first view recorded in the Mishnah, is, in this writer&#x2019;s opinion, readily resolvable by positing that the requirement for marking <italic>orlah</italic> and <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic>, either every year or only during the sabbatical year, is not mandated by the prohibition against placing a stumbling block before the blind but by rabbinic legislation limited to those cases. Indeed, the requirement to mark burial sites, also recorded in the same Mishnah, is explicitly regarded by many authorities as rabbinic in nature.<sup><xref rid="fn542">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>The matter is perhaps best explained if it is understood that the biblical duties of admonition and of preventing transgression by others is personal in nature but does not mandate expenditure of financial resources or extensive travail.<sup><xref rid="fn543">49</xref></sup> The Sages, by rabbinic decree, did, however, impose obligations involving expenditure of money, at least in some circumstances. Marking burial places in order to prevent unwitting infraction is an obvious example. The first opinion recorded in the Mishnah, <italic>Demai</italic> 3:5, maintains that the Sages promulgated a similar rule requiring landowners to mark orchards and vineyards producing prohibited <italic>orlah</italic> and restricted <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> despite the fact that the trespassers have no right to pick even fruit not subject to those restrictions. R. Shimon ben Gamliel declares that there could not have been a general edict of that nature because of a contravailing consideration: <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>. R. Shimon ben Gamliel recognizes the cogency of the concern auguring for such legislation but asserts that such concern was tempered by refusal on the part of the Sages to legislate on behalf of a person who is purposefully wicked.</p>
<p>The difficulty inherent in this thesis lies in explaining the statement of the Palestinian Talmud declaring that R. Shimon ben Gamliel is in agreement with the opinion that food presented to the proprietress of the inn must be tithed because &#x201C;A scholar does not allow an unperfected matter to issue from his hand,&#x201D; a principle that appears to have a quite different connotation and hence to be entirely extraneous.</p>
<p>The principle &#x201C;A scholar does not allow an unperfected matter to issue from his hand&#x201D; is formulated by the Gemara, <italic>Eiruvin</italic> 32a and <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;im</italic> 9a, as a <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic>, i.e., a presumptive rule regarding comportment of learned individuals. The halakhic presumption is founded upon the usual comportment of scholars. Since it is their wont to tithe all produce in their possession, absent evidence to the contrary it may be assumed that they have done so.</p>
<p>The statement of the Palestinian Talmud can readily be understood as raising the presumptive principle to a mandatory role of comportment. The Sages did indeed base the rule of evidence upon empirical observation and hence the Gemara, <italic>Eiruvin</italic> 32a and <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;im</italic> 9a, terms the principle a &#x201C;<italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic>&#x201D; or a presumptive rule of conduct. But, having established the presumptive rule on empirical evidence, they sought to assure that reliance on that presumption would not lead to inadvertent transgression; accordingly, they transformed the evidentiary principle into a mandatory rule.<sup><xref rid="fn544">50</xref></sup> R. Shimon ben Gamliel, since he subscribes to the principle <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>, certainly recognized that there would have been no reason to promulgate legislation for the purpose of protecting the proprietress from transgression. But, declares the Palestinian Talmud, R. Shimon ben Gamliel concedes that they did so simply in order to reinforce the underlying normative rule.<sup><xref rid="fn545">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to this analysis, <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> is not at all an independent principle of Halakhah justifying a course of action. Rather, it is a rationale explaining why legislation was <italic>not</italic> promulgated in a particular instance. <italic>Hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> explains only why transgressors were not shielded from further transgression; <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn546">52</xref></sup> is not an invitation to entice malfeasors to further transgression and certainly not a license to cause them physical harm.<sup><xref rid="fn547">53</xref></sup></p>
<h1>VI. <italic>Spiritual Welfare vs. Physical Harm</italic></h1>
<p>Putting aside the issue of why one need not be concerned with the spiritual welfare of the wicked, in context, the dictum <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> establishes only that the wicked may be allowed to become mired in transgression. As expressed explicitly by Rambam in his <italic>Commentary on the Mishnah</italic>, <italic>Ma&#x2019;aser Sheni</italic> 5:1: &#x201C;We should not seek a remedy for a robber so that he does not stumble because the sin of robbery is even greater.&#x201D; The phrase &#x201C;that he does not stumble&#x201D; seems to reflect only a lack of concern for the thief&#x2019;s spiritual welfare. As Rabbi Frankel points out in his contribution to the discussion in <italic>Pa&#x2019;amei Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>, despite the presence of the concluding phrase &#x201C;and let him die&#x201D; there is no evidence that the aphorism &#x201C;Gorge the wicked and let him die&#x201D; is intended literally as sanction for causing the physical death of a thief; the sole harm caused the thief in the case described by the Mishnah is a compounded transgression bringing heavenly punishment in its wake. Rabbi Zilberstein, rather implausibly, insists upon a literal reading of the dictum. However, as Rabbi Rabinowitz points out in his article, if the word &#x201C;<italic>hal&#x2019;itehu</italic>&#x201D; is understood literally, it follows that even overt execution of the thief would be sanctioned &#x2014; a conclusion that Rabbi Zilberstein acknowledges to be incorrect.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is noteworthy that Rambam concludes his comment with the observation that the robber need not be preserved from further transgression &#x201C;because the sin of robbery is even greater.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn548">54</xref></sup> It may be inferred that a would-be transgressor need not be prevented from committing additional infractions that are less severe in nature but must be prevented from committing transgressions more serious than those he intends.</p>
<p>Basing himself upon Rambam&#x2019;s comment, R. Zevi Pesach Frank, <italic>Teshuvot Har &#x1E92;evi</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 125, offers a novel interpretation of R. Shimon ben Gamliel&#x2019;s formulation of <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>. <italic>Har &#x1E92;evi</italic> establishes that there is no prohibition of theft with regard to <italic>ma&#x2019;aser sheni</italic> and <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> which are &#x201C;property of the Deity (<italic>mammon Gevoha</italic>).&#x201D; Accordingly, R. Shimon ben Gamliel opposed measures designed to prevent trespassers from eating <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> because that would only prompt them to pick grapes from other vines and thereby commit the more serious transgression of theft. <italic>Hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>, according to this analysis, means that the thief must be left to his own devices because intervention would only enhance the transgression. According to <italic>Har &#x1E92;evi</italic>&#x2019;s understanding of Rambam, R. Shimon ben Gamliel&#x2019;s disagreement with the <italic>&#x1E93;enu&#x2019;in</italic> is extremely narrow and <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> is not at all a principle of general application.</p>
<h1>VII. <italic>Concluding Remarks</italic></h1>
<p>According to Rabbi Zilberstein, the poisoner must be exonerated and even commended because the aphorism &#x201C;Gorge the wicked and let him die&#x201D; is to be understood literally. Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s critics emphasize that theft is not a capital crime and that, in any event, punishment of that nature can be imposed only by a qualified <italic>bet din</italic>. Moreover, as codified by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Ro&#x1E93;ea&#x1E25;</italic> 2:2, even indirect homicide is a crime punishable by death only at the hands of Heaven. To Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s contention that it is the thief who causes his own death by imbibing poison they respond that, with regard to tort culpability, the Gemara, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 47b, declares that placing poison before an animal results in liability at the hands of Heaven even though the act of consuming the poison is initiated by the animal. Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s rejoinder is that placing poison in one&#x2019;s own premises does not result in culpability even at the hands of Heaven and, moreover, a human being, unlike an animal, bears sole responsibility for the untoward results of his trespass.</p>
<p>Yet, as noted earlier, Rabbi Zilberstein concedes that, even in one&#x2019;s own home, notice of impending danger, either actual (&#x201C;Beware the dog&#x201D;) or constructive (&#x201C;Thou shalt not steal&#x201D;) must be provided and, moreover, the visitor must have acted imprudently (by not ascertaining that the ladder was still in place or by not subjecting the sandwich to a chemical analysis). Indeed, if actual notice of placing poison has been given to the potential victim, there seems to be no reason why the person placing the poison before a human being should be judged guilty even in the eyes of Heaven and even if the poison is placed outside of his domain. As expressed by <italic>Tosafot</italic>, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 47b, s.v. <italic>havah</italic>, since the harm was brought upon the victim by his own act, &#x201C;it is not proper&#x201D; that the person who merely made the poison available be held liable.<sup><xref rid="fn549">55</xref></sup> If so, the person placing the poison before the victim with notice should be exonerated even if the poison is placed outside his own domain. If, on the other hand, constructive notice (&#x201C;Thou shalt not steal&#x201D;) is not regarded as sufficient notice, it should follow that, contrary to Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s distinction, the person who places the poison before the victim should be culpable at the hands of Heaven for intentionally causing the victim&#x2019;s death even if it occurs in his own domain.</p>
<ftnote id="fn495">1. R. Shalom Mordecai Schwadron, <italic>Teshuvot Maharsham</italic>, IV, no. 140, addresses precisely this issue and reaches the opposite conclusion. Maharsham was asked if it is permissible, with prior notice to their owner, to spread poison in one&#x2019;s own field in order to destroy intruding animals. The interlocutor was inclined to permit such action on the grounds that &#x201C;a person may do as he wishes within his property&#x201D; and Maharsham indicates that the argument appealed to him. Nevertheless, citing R. Yair Chaim Bacharach, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>, no. 165, Maharsham rules that self-help directed against brute animals cannot be sanctioned even within one&#x2019;s own property. See <italic>infra</italic>, notes 8-10 and accompanying text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn496">2. Presumably, in light of his later comment, Rabbi Zilberstein means that, by virtue of his intelligence, a human being is always on notice whereas a brute animal is not. See <italic>infra</italic>, note 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Although the Gemara, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 47b, invokes the consideration &#x201C;<italic>lo hava lah le-mikhla</italic> -- it should not have eaten&#x201D; to exonerate the tortfearsor only from liability in a human court but not from liability according to the &#x201C;laws of Heaven,&#x201D; Rabbi Zilberstein apparently maintains that, in the case of a rational human being, invocation of that consideration obviates culpability even in the eyes of Heaven. As explained by <italic>Tosafot</italic>, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 47b, the rationale <italic>lo hava lah le-mikhla</italic>, when applicable, establishes that the cause of the resultant harm was intentionally generated by the victim; hence it is inappropriate that liability be assigned to another.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn497">3. Rabbi Kanievsky, as cited in <italic>Derekh Si&#x1E25;ah</italic>, apparently regards this as the crucial factor distinguishing the instant case from the rule with regard to placing poison before an animal.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn498">4. Intentional infliction of harm is forbidden even if the resultant harm is in the form of <italic>force majeure</italic>. See <italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 398:2. Intentional infliction of harm is apparently always forbidden and hence should be prohibited even against a trespasser. If so, the crucial consideration is notice which serves, according to Rabbi Zilberstein, to render the resultant harm unintentional from the vantage point of the tortfeasor. See <italic>infra</italic>, note 5. However, if notice is sufficient to render the victim the author of his own harm, it is difficult to understand why <italic>gerama</italic> with prior notice should exempt the tortfeasor from liability in the eyes of Heaven only in his own domain but not in a public place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn499">5. In effect, the negligence of the victim renders him the author of his own harm and hence exonerates the tortfeasor, who does not anticipate such negligence on the part of the victim, from culpability even at the hands of Heaven. See <italic>supra</italic>, note 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn500">6. However, Maharsha, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 15b, comments that dogs of that nature are kept &#x201C;to protect against <italic>burglars</italic> in the night.&#x201D; Maharsha may readily be understood as interpreting the Gemara&#x2019;s statement as interdicting physical harm to the burglar. Rabbi Zilberstein, however, dismisses such a reading of Maharsha&#x2019;s comment in asserting that, although the dog may legitimately attack a burglar, the concern is that he may attack an unwary innocent person. Moreover, as Rabbi Zilberstein points out, until the intruder actually becomes a thief by committing the theft, there is an obligation of rescue.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Actually, in accordance with Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s own position with regard to the duty of rescue which will be discussed in section III, Maharsha&#x2019;s comment presents no difficulty at all. Unlike Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s depiction of the sandwich thief, the burglar steals <italic>le-tei&#x2019;avon</italic> and hence there does exist a duty of rescue. Moreover, Rabbi Zilberstein concedes that the duty of rescue is abrogated only if the endangered person&#x2019;s transgression is both wanton and habitual. There is no reason to assume that the intruders against whom dogs afford protection are habitual burglars.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn501">7. Rabbi Kanievsky&#x2019;s ruling and the analysis presented by Rabbi Spitz seem problematic since intentional infliction of harm is always prohibited. See <italic>supra</italic>, note 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn502">8. <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> does, however, draw attention to the Gemara&#x2019;s discussion, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 28a, regarding an ox that mounts a second ox with intent to kill. The Gemara declares that the owner of the attacked animal may extricate his animal and if, in the process of doing so, the attacking ox falls and is killed he is not liable. That provision would seem to indicate that self-help is available without notice, even against an animal causing damage without the knowledge of its master. That problematic ruling notwithstanding, <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> reiterates that the general rule is that self-help requires prior notice and, as explained <italic>infra</italic>, note 9, is limited to slaughter of the offending animal.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn503">9. Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Nizkei Mammon</italic> 5:1, rules that the animal&#x2019;s master must be warned three times. <italic>Kesef Mishneh</italic>, <italic>ad locum</italic>, questions the need for three admonitions and argues that one warning is sufficient. <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> contends that even Rambam would agree that three admonitions are required only in the case of a fence that has developed a breach that allows animals to escape but not with regard to an unrestricted marauding animal. Moreover, contends <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>, the remedy that is sanctioned is slaughter that renders the meat of the animal fit for consumption. Even that remedy is sanctioned only if the animal is in any event destined to be slaughtered since slaughter of an animal raised for its meat causes the animal&#x2019;s owner no financial harm. However, slaughter is not permitted if the value of the animal is enhanced because it has been raised for breeding or the like, or to lay eggs as in the case of the hen that was the subject of litigation before <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn504">10. Curiously, although Maharsham rejects this distinction he comments that, were it possible to substantiate the distinction, it would be consistent with <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>&#x2019;s ruling prohibiting self-help, presumably because <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> might be understood as forbidding self-help only outside of one&#x2019;s own domain. However, a close reading of <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> indicates that this cannot be correct for two reasons: 1) there is no indication in <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>&#x2019;s responsum that the hen was killed only after leaving the merchant&#x2019;s establishment; and 2) such a distinction would entirely resolve Maharsham&#x2019;s perplexity based upon the difficulty posed by the discussion presented in <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 28a, cited <italic>supra</italic>, note 8. Since Maharsham allows the difficulty to remain unresolved it may be inferred that he rejected a distinction of that nature.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn505">11. Unlike Halakhah, which would regard the danger resulting from a spring-gun to be in the form of <italic>gerama</italic> for which the person setting the trap would be culpable at the hands of Heaven but for which a <italic>bet din</italic> could not award damages, common law would enforce such a claim.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn506">12. <italic>Restatement of Torts</italic> &#x00A7;85, p. 180 states:</ftnote>
<p align="blockquote">The value of human life and limb, not only to the individual concerned but also to society, so out-weights [sic.] the interest of a possessor of land in excluding from it those whom he is not willing to admit thereto that a possessor of land has, as is stated in &#x00A7;79, no privilege to use force intended or likely to cause death or serious harm against another whom the possessor sees about to enter his premises or meddle with his chattel, unless the intrusion threatens death or serious bodily harm to the occupiers or users of the premises&#x2026; . A possessor of land cannot do indirectly and by a mechanical device that which, were he present, he could not do immediately and in person. Therefore, he cannot gain a privilege to install, for the purpose of protecting his land from intrusions harmless to the lives and limbs of the occupiers or users of it, a mechanical device whose only purpose is to inflict death or serious harm upon such as may intrude, by giving notice of his intention to inflict, by mechanical means and indirectly, harm which he could not, even after request, inflict directly were he present.</p>

<p align="blockquote">Where the intruder is not proceeding with violence, defendant may normally, in the first instance, use only the mildest of force, for which the old form of pleading had a phrase &#x2014;&#x201C;molliter manus imposuit;&#x201D; he gently laid hands upon him, and if in the process his own safety is threatened, he may defend himself, and even kill if necessary; but in the first instance a mere trespass does not justify such an act. Even the tradition that a man&#x2019;s house is his castle, and that one may kill in defense of his dwelling, has given way in most jurisdictions to the view that such force is not justified unless the intrusion threatens the personal safety of the occupants or the commission of a felony.</p>

Cf., however, <italic>Taz</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 334:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote>For sources ruling that conversion for purposes of marriage may not be performed in order to avert threatened apostasy see R.

See, however, R. David Zevi Hoffman, <italic>Teshuvot Melamed le-Ho&#x2019;il</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 83, who permitted improper conversion of a man for purposes of marriage in order to prevent more serious infractions on the part of his Jewish paramour. Cf., R. Shlomoh Kluger, <italic>Tuv Ta&#x2019;am va-Da&#x2019;at</italic>, I, no. 130, who, under such circumstances, permitted a man to marry a proselyte with whom he had consorted prior to her conversion. See also R. Eliyahu Chazan, <italic>Ta&#x2019;alumot Lev</italic>, III, no. 31, followed by <italic>Piskei Uzi&#x2019;el</italic>, no. 60, who sanction the marriage of a female convert within the statutory three-month waiting period in order to avoid more serious infraction.</ftnote>
<ftnote>See also <italic>ibid</italic>., no. 61, secs. 6-7 and no. 63, sec.1, which record Rabbi Uziel&#x2019;s ruling permitting conversion for the sake of marriage for the same reason. That position was earlier formulated in his <italic>Mishpetei Uzi&#x2019;el</italic>, I, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no.14; II, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, nos. 53 and 58; and <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, II, no. 25. Rabbi Uziel invokes <italic>Pe&#x2019;er ha-Dor</italic>, no. 132, in declaring that parties to such marriages are &#x201C;penitents&#x201D; for whom restrictions that are imposed only <italic>le-khat&#x1E25;ilah</italic>, i.e., before the fact, may be suspended. However, since a <italic>kohen</italic> who marries a convert must, <italic>post factum</italic>, divorce her, Rabbi Uziel is not prepared to sanction conversion for the purpose of marrying a <italic>kohen</italic>. There is, however, an apparent inconsistency between that ruling and his earlier-cited ruling permitting conversion of a woman consorting with a Jewish man in circumstances in which it is clear that the parties will not abstain from sexual relations for the mandated ninety-day period. That prohibition applies even <italic>post factum</italic> in the sense that it is ongoing and remains in force even if a valid marriage has been contracted.</ftnote>
<ftnote>[Parenthetically, Rabbi Uziel&#x2019;s citation of <italic>Pe&#x2019;er ha-Dor</italic> as precedent is not apropos. Rambam addresses situations in which, <italic>ante factum</italic>, contracting a marriage is forbidden but once the marriage has been contracted the relationship is not disturbed. Sanctioning of the ongoing relationship is evidence of the diminished severity of the infraction. Rabbi Uziel assumes as a matter of course that a <italic>bet din</italic> that accepts the candidacy of a convert motivated by prospects of marriage incurs an infraction. That is also the position of many other authorities. See, for example, R. David Zevi Hoffman, <italic>Melamed le-Ho&#x2019;il</italic>, <italic>Yoreh Deah,</italic> no. 83. Cf., however, <italic>Iggerot Mosheh</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic>, II, no. 4. Nevertheless, a conversion carried out under such circumstances is valid. However, the validity of such a conversion is entirely unrelated to the infraction committed by the <italic>bet din</italic>. It is the <italic>act</italic> of conversion <italic>per se</italic> that is interdicted either by formal prohibition or procedural rule. Validity of the conversion has no bearing upon the prohibited nature of the <italic>bet din</italic>&#x2019;s act of conversion; the <italic>bet din</italic> is prohibited from performing a perfectly valid conversion. The distinction between <italic>ante factum</italic> and <italic>post factum</italic> is irrelevant to the act performed by the <italic>bet din</italic> and hence there is no basis for regarding that infraction as one of diminished severity.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn523">29. Although his statement is somewhat ambiguous, Radvaz states explicitly that the partners to a civil union are &#x201C;wicked&#x201D; even if they have not consorted. In this case Radvaz may have considered them &#x201C;wicked,&#x201D; not because of entry into a civil marriage <italic>per se</italic>, but for having done so while the woman was still married to another man. However, in another responsum, VII, no. 11, Radvaz seems to deem the groom to be &#x201C;wicked,&#x201D; and hence unworthy of assistance in rendering the bride permissible to him, even if he is not suspected of having had a liaison with her.</ftnote>

The community wished to censure him and to impose a fine but the local rabbi objected on the grounds that sanctions might well cause the sinner to eat other forbidden foods as well and perhaps even to &#x201C;leave the religion.&#x201D; <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>&#x2019;s reaction was &#x201C;&#x2026;<italic>hal&#x2019;itehu</italic> <italic>la-rasha va-yamot</italic> and, in the days of the Temple, the Sanhedrin was never concerned lest transgressions increase &#x2026; . We may deduce that we are concerned for the well-being of the general populace even if it is inimical to the benefit of the individual.&#x201D; It is clear that <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>&#x2019;s substantive consideration was the spiritual welfare of the community for which the well-being of the individual must be sacrificed. The term &#x201C;<italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>&#x201D; is invoked by him, not as an operative principle, but as a <italic>meli&#x1E93;ah</italic> or aphorism.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Much earlier, <italic>Akeidat Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>, <italic>Parashat Va-Yera</italic>, <italic>sha&#x2019;ar</italic> 20, refused to sanction communal support of prostitutes. The argument for such support was that services provided by those women served to prevent the more severe sin of adultery. <italic>Akeidat Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> ruled that a community dare not become complicit in even a minor transgression in order to preclude individuals from more serious transgressions. <italic>Akeidat Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> does not, however, invoke the principle <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>. Cf., however, <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93; Eli&#x2019;ezer</italic>, VII, no. 22.

His concern was not the applicability of <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> but the concern voiced by <italic>Akeidat Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>. That point was not grasped by Yosef Achituv, <italic>Te&#x1E25;umin</italic>, p. 169. For an opposing view see the responsum of R.

<ftnote id="fn531">37. Mahari Perla explains the ruling of R. Jose, <italic>Demai</italic> 3:5, discussed <italic>infra</italic>, note 41, permitting delivery of untithed food to the proprietress of an inn in a similar manner. R. Jose predicates his ruling on the declaration &#x201C;We have no responsibility for the dishonest.&#x201D; Mahari Perla explains that since the guest cannot prevent theft of his food he has no obligation of suretyship with regard to other prohibitions. However, it is unclear why delivery of untithed food to the proprietress does not constitute an active form of placing a stumbling-block before the blind. Mahari Perla does comment that there is no stumbling-block because the guest delivers the food &#x201C;because of his own need&#x2026; she eats of his produce in theft against his will and without his premission&#x201D; and that it is not within his power to prevent her transgression with regard to tithes, &#x201C;since he is compelled to deliver [his produce] into her hand to prepare his food.&#x201D; Those comments are puzzling since the situation is certainly not one of <italic>force majeure</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn532">38. See also R. Joshua Baumol, <italic>Teshuvot Emek Halakhah</italic>, II, no. 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn533">39. This distinction is also drawn by a host of other authorities as will be shown later on in this section.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn534">40. Rabbi Zilberstein asserts that <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>&#x2019;s ruling is limited to invited guests. This writer fails to discern a halakhic distinction attachable to that factual difference.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn535">41. See, however, <italic>Tosefet Yom Tov</italic>, <italic>Demai</italic> 3:5. <italic>Tosefot Yom Tov</italic> suggests that, according to some early authorities, the proprietress may not be a &#x201C;wicked&#x201D; person and hence may deserve protection from inadvertent transgression even according to R. Shimon ben Gamliel. The Gemara, <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 6b, suggests that the Mishnah reflects a general concern that people commonly, but illicitly, make substitutions for commodities entrusted to them. The Gemara retorts that such is not a general practice but is limited to proprietresses of inns. As explained by Rashi, the proprietress justifies her conduct on the basis of the rhetorical consideration &#x201C;Shall the student eat cold food while I eat hot food?&#x201D; Although unauthorized substitution is indeed an act of theft regardless of motivation, the proprietress erroneously believes it to constitute a legitimate and even laudable act of self-sacrifice. If so, although the proprietress indeed acts incorrectly, nevertheless, she can hardly be deemed &#x201C;wicked.&#x201D; In an alternative resolution of the apparent contradiction inherent in Rambam&#x2019;s rulings, <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> explains that Rambam understood the Mishnah in a manner identical to that of Rashi and hence rules that since the proprietress is not wicked she must be preserved from transgression.</ftnote>
<ftnote><italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> further notes that the Palestinian Talmud indicates that R. Shimon ben Gamliel may not have accepted the view of R. Jose. The Palestinian Talmud suggests that, although <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> is the general rule, it does not extend to untithed food. Regarding untithed food the presumption is that &#x201C;A scholar does not cause an unperfected matter to issue from his hands,&#x201D; i.e., a person who observes the laws of tithing does not allow any food to leave his possession while yet untithed. The Palestinian Talmud, in effect, declares, that this dictum does not merely reflect an empirical presumption but has halakhic significance as establishing a hard and fast rule. Cf., however, the understanding of that statement of the Palestinian Talmud advanced by <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish</italic>, <italic>Dem&#x2019;ai</italic> 81:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote>However, <italic>Tosafot</italic>, disagreeing with Rashi, understand the contention attributed to the proprietress to be declarative rather than quizzical and hence as reflecting her own sense of fairness: &#x201C;Let the student eat cold food and I will eat hot food&#x0021;&#x201D; The proprietress labors on behalf of her guest. She does not deem it fair to herself for her food to become increasingly colder as she prepares warm food for her guest. Therefore, she serves him already available cooked food that she had cooked for herself but which has become cold and cooks again for herself so that she may enjoy hot food. According to <italic>Tosafot</italic>&#x2019;s understanding, her rationale is self-serving and not at all laudatory. Nevertheless, <italic>Be-&#x1E92;el ha-&#x1E24;okhmah</italic>, I, no. 27, argues that, although incorrect as a matter of law, even such a person genuinely believes her conduct to be justified on the grounds that she should not be deprived of a benefit because of a service she is performing on behalf of another. Hence, contends <italic>Be-&#x1E92;el ha-&#x1E24;okhmah,</italic> even according to <italic>Tosafot</italic>, the proprietress should not be relegated to the category of the &#x201C;wicked.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn536">42. An identical distinction is formulated by <italic>Melekhet Shlomoh</italic>, in his commentary on <italic>Demai</italic> 3:5, in stating that the ruling of the Palestinian Talmud is limited to situations involving an overt act. See also <italic>Teshuvot Emek Halakhah</italic>, II, no. 4. That distinction is rejected by <italic>Be-&#x1E92;el ha-&#x1E24;okhmah</italic>, I, no. 27, who maintains that <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic>, in principle, extends to overt acts as well.

<ftnote id="fn546">52. There may well be entirely different grounds to justify the student&#x2019;s course of action in the case of the poisoned sandwich. The Gemara, <italic>Ketubot</italic> 86a and <italic>&#x1E24;ullin</italic> 132b, declares that a person may be compelled to fulfill a commandment, e.g., the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> of <italic>sukkah</italic> or of the four species, by means of physical force, if necessary, &#x201C;until his life departs.&#x201D; There is considerable controversy with regard to whether the recalcitrant person may be beaten only within an &#x201C;inch of his life&#x201D; since, if he dies, he certainly will not fulfill the commandment, or whether he may be beaten until he expires.

Cf., Rambam, <italic>Guide for the Perplexed</italic>, Part I, chap. 12. <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic> asserts that, &#x201C;when it is certain to us&#x201D; that duress will not accomplish the desired result, not even a hair on the head of the would-be transgressor may be disturbed.</ftnote>
<ftnote><italic>Ke&#x1E93;ot ha-&#x1E24;oshen</italic> 3:1 rules that only a <italic>bet din</italic> comprised of ordained judges competent to impose capital punishment is authorized to use physical force to enforce specific performance with regard to fulfilling a commandment.

<ftnote>In his response to <italic>Netivot ha-Mishpat</italic>, the author of <italic>Ke&#x1E93;ot ha-&#x1E24;oshen</italic>, <italic>Meshovev ha-Netivot</italic> 3:1, distinguishes between positive commandments and negative prohibitions: Enforcement of positive obligations, he maintains, requires judicial authority but a properly constituted <italic>bet din</italic> may apply coercive measures even to the point of death. However, prevention of transgression of a negative commandment, he asserts, is a private obligation and hence the force applied may not be lethal in nature. This is also the position of R. Joseph Babad, <italic>Min&#x1E25;at &#x1E24;innukh</italic>, <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> 8, sec. 10, and <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> 55, sec. 20. See also R. Jonathan Eibeschutz, <italic>Urim ve-Tumim</italic> 4:1 and <italic>Teshuvot Maharya</italic>, II, no. 164 as well as <italic>Sedei &#x1E24;emed</italic>, <italic>Asifat Dinim</italic>, <italic>ma&#x2019;arekhet heh</italic>, no. 4. Cf., however, R. Chaim Palaggi, <italic>&#x1E24;ikkekei Lev, Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 19.</ftnote>
<ftnote><italic>Teshuvot Radvaz</italic>, IV, no. 1,329, (258) seems to rule that physical force may be used only by a person having authority over the would-be transgressor, e.g., a father or a master. See the terminology employed by Rema, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 421:13. However, R. Ya&#x2019;akov Yesha&#x2019;ya Blau, <italic>Pit&#x1E25;ei &#x1E24;oshen</italic>, V, chap. 2, notes 19 and 20, understands Radvaz&#x2019; comments as being consistent with the position of <italic>Yam shel Shlomoh</italic> cited later in this note. See also <italic>Sedei &#x1E24;emed</italic>, <italic>Asifat Dinim</italic>, <italic>ma&#x2019;arekhet heh</italic>, no. 4. However, R. Naphtali Zevi Judah Berlin, <italic>Ha&#x2019;amek She&#x2019;elah</italic>, <italic>Parashat Va-Yeshev</italic>, <italic>She&#x2019;ilta</italic> 27, sec. 6, asserts that physical force may not be used but that, <italic>post factum</italic>, at least in the case of a master <italic>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</italic> his slave, there is no liability. See also sources cited by <italic>Pit&#x1E25;ei &#x1E24;oshen</italic>, V, chap. 2, notes 19 and 20.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Thus, virtually all authorities agree that physical force may be employed to prevent transgression of a negative commandment. Accordingly, physical force would be warranted in order to identify a thief and thereby prevent further acts of theft. In the case under discussion, although a lethal poison was administered, the student was entirely confident of the ability of the already prepared antidote to avert a fatal result. Administration of the poison coupled with its antidote certainly constituted physical force &#x2014; but non-lethal force is warranted in order to prevent prospective infraction of the prohibition against theft.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Nevertheless, it is necessary to be mindful of the comment of R. Shlomoh Luria, <italic>Yam shel Shlomoh</italic>, <italic>Bava Kamma</italic> 3:9, to the effect that, although technically correct, physical force of any kind should not be employed other than by designated authorities. The danger of, and possible abuses arising from, private parties taking the law into their own hands are readily apparent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn547">53. For a discussion of why theft is deemed a more grievous transgression than <italic>orlah</italic> and <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> see <italic>Teshuvot Be&#x2019;er Mosheh</italic>, V, no. 162, sec. 9 and cf., <italic>Be-&#x1E92;el ha-&#x1E24;okhmah</italic>, I, no. 27. <italic>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</italic>, II, no. 1, cites R. Meir Arak, <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Pittim</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 1, who explains that theft is a more serious transgression because it is a sin against both God and man whereas <italic>orlah</italic> and <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> are only sins against God.</ftnote>
<ftnote>See <italic>Teshuvot Emek Halakhah</italic>, II, no. 4, who seeks to demonstrate that Rambam&#x2019;s limitation of the principle is compelled by an analysis of the situation with regard to <italic>orlah</italic> and to <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> presented by the Mishnah. <italic>Emek Halakhah</italic> argues that, if <italic>hali&#x2019;tehu la-rasha</italic> is a rule of general application there is no reason to caution against <italic>orlah and kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> even during the sabbatical year. Fruit whose status is doubtful, i.e., the fruit may <italic>possibly</italic> be prohibited, is also forbidden and hence, if the principle <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> were to apply, there would be no need to mark such fruit. Accordingly, reasons <italic>Emek Halakhah</italic>, Rambam must have deduced that <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> applies only during the years in which the produce is not ownerless and is occasioned by the more serious transgression of theft. Of course, that argument fails if, as postulated by <italic>Tuv Ta&#x2019;am va-Da&#x2019;at</italic>, <italic>hal&#x2019;itehu la-rasha</italic> does not apply in situations in which all transgression can be prevented; accordingly, it is in the seventh year, during which the only possible infraction is <italic>orlah</italic> or <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic>, that notice in the form of marking the fruit as <italic>orlah</italic> or <italic>kerem reva&#x2019;i</italic> is required.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn548">54. See R. Shlomoh Eger, <italic>Gilyon Maharsha</italic>, in a gloss on <italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 151:6 and <italic>idem, Teshuvot R.

<ftnote id="fn549">55. Although that contention is rejected by the Gemara, it must be remembered that Rabbi Zilberstein maintains that it is rejected only with regard to brute animals, which cannot be expected not to consume food placed before them, but remains valid with regard to rational human beings who realize that they should not steal food belonging to others.</ftnote>

<p align="blockquote">ZOHAR, LEVITICUS 88b</p>
<h1>I. <italic>The Exhibitions</italic></h1>
<p>Over the past decade exhibitions displaying preserved skinless human corpses with well-defined muscles and tissues have attracted over twenty million viewers worldwide and have grossed over two hundred million dollars. The mastermind of the operation is a German scientist, Gunther von Hagens, whose &#x201C;Body Worlds&#x201D; exhibit utilizes cadavers prepared and preserved at what has been described as &#x201C;a modern mummification factory located in China.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn550">1</xref></sup> Bodies are dissected and skin and fat are removed. The bodies are then placed in machines that replace natural human fluids with soft chemical polymers. The corpses may be placed in seated or standing positions and displayed as doing lifelike things, such as holding a musical instrument or sitting astride a similarly preserved dead horse. A competing exhibition company, Premier Exhibitions, is the creator of &#x201C;Bodies: The Exhibition&#x201D; that was shown at the South Street Seaport in New York City. Similar exhibitions have appeared in major museums in Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles.<sup><xref rid="fn551">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Human rights activists are concerned that these commercial enterprises may be using the bodies of mentally ill people and executed prisoners. Presumably due to a concern with regard to improper exploitation, in July, 2006 the Chinese government issued regulations outlawing the purchase or sale of human bodies and restricting the import or export of human specimens for purposes other than scientific research.</p>
<p>As is well known, Jewish law not only forbids ignominious and undignified treatment of a corpse but regards the human body as an object deserving of respect of the highest order because of its status as the earthly abode of a sacred soul. Accordingly, the body of the deceased must be accorded prompt and dignified burial. Dissection of a corpse is permitted only in exceptional circumstances, e.g., for preservation of a human life already at risk.</p>
<h1>II. <italic>Violation of a Corpse</italic></h1>
<p>There is some controversy with regard to whether the prohibition against violating a corpse is limited to bodies of deceased Jews or whether it extends to non-Jewish corpses as well. R. Meir Shapiro, <italic>Teshuvot Or ha-Me&#x2019;ir</italic>, no. 74, demonstrates that it may be inferred that Rashi and Ramban, in their respective commentaries on Deuteronomy 21:23, would differ with regard to their resolution of that question. The scriptural verse that is the subject of their comments prescribes that the corpse of even a convicted criminal may not be allowed to hang from the gallows in ignominy but must be interred without delay. Both commentators cite an aggadic explanation as the rationale underlying the regulation mandating respect for the dead. The source is a talmudic parable concerning a pair of identical twins. One of the twins grows to adulthood and is crowned king of the realm; the second becomes a highwayman, is apprehended and executed as punishment for his crimes. Suppose, then, we are told, the body of the executed twin were placed on public display. Would not passersby scrutinize the body and, perceiving what they believe to be the familiar countenance of their ruler, assume that it is none other than the king himself who has been punished so ignominiously? Man is created in the image of God with the result that, however that anthropomorphic term is to be understood, the human body reflects an aura of divinity. Just as the king is dishonored in the indignity meted out to his twin, the Deity is dishonored in the dishonor of the divine image associated with the human body.</p>
<p>Rashi and Ramban differ in their recounting of the parable in one salient detail. Rashi uses the term &#x201C;Israelite&#x201D; in association with dishonor of the body while Ramban fails to use that qualifying term and thereby implies that the prohibition encompasses the desecration of any human corpse. <italic>Tosafot Tom Tov</italic>, <italic>Avot</italic> 3:14, explains at length that all human beings, gentiles as well as Jews, are created in the image of God. That matter is not at all a point of dispute as evidenced by the fact that it is Adam&#x2014; who was not a Jew&#x2014;who is described in Genesis 1:27 as having been created &#x201C;in the image of God.&#x201D; The controversy between Rashi and Ramban is limited to the ambit of a specific biblical prohibition, i.e., whether it is the spark of the divine universally present in all of mankind that triggers the prohibition against desecration of a corpse or whether it is the particular sanctity of a body hallowed by participation in Sinaitic revelation that evokes comparison with the Deity.</p>
<h1>III. <italic>Prohibited Benefit</italic></h1>
<h2>A. <italic>Financial Benefit</italic></h2>
<p>Jews, thankfully, do not seem to be involved in the ghastly process of modern-day mummification. This writer has, however, been the recipient of numerous inquiries with regard to the propriety of attending these various exhibits. There have been no similar inquiries from persons who profit financially from the exhibits. One may at least hope that there have been no such inquiries because those involved are not Jews.</p>
<p>The first issue to be addressed is the prohibition regarding deriving benefit from a cadaver. Charging an admission fee constitutes a clearly prohibited financial benefit as has been unequivocally stated by R. Jonathan Eibeschutz, <italic>Binah le-Ittim, Hilkhot Yom Tov</italic> 1:23, in addressing a question posed by a person who sought to exhibit a grotesquely formed abortus in order to earn a livelihood.<sup><xref rid="fn552">3</xref></sup> If it is forbidden to accept such fees, payment for viewing the cadaver would similarly be prohibited as a form of &#x201C;placing a stumbling block before the blind.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The sole issue in that regard is whether the prohibition against deriving benefit from a corpse applies only to a Jewish cadaver or whether it extends to a non-Jewish cadaver as well. That question was addressed in detail in the context of a discussion of fetal tissue experimentation in this writer&#x2019;s <italic>Contemporary Halakhic Problems</italic>, IV (New York, 1995), 185-187.</p>
<h2>B. <italic>Scientific Knowledge</italic></h2>
<p>If deriving benefit from a non-Jewish cadaver is not interdicted there is no formal prohibition against attending such an exhibit. If, however, deriving benefit from non-Jewish cadavers is forbidden, the issue resolves itself into the question of whether attendance at such exhibits represents a proscribed &#x201C;benefit.&#x201D; In responsa examining the permissibility of postmortem examinations, both R. Moses Sofer, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 336, and his disciple R. Moses Schick, <italic>Teshuvot Maharam Shik</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 344, declare that acquiring medical information by means of such procedures constitutes a forbidden benefit.<sup><xref rid="fn553">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In support of that position <italic>Maharam Shik</italic> cites the ruling recorded in the Mishnah, <italic>Nedarim</italic> 48a, to the effect that a person who, by means of a vow, generates a prohibition against benefiting from a fellow townsman is forbidden to use Torah scrolls that constitute property owned by the community. Quite apparently, the knowledge gleaned from such books is regarded as a &#x201C;benefit&#x201D; forbidden to such an individual since, were those scrolls not available, it would be necessary for him to spend his own funds in order to acquire a Torah scroll for such purposes. Similarly, argues <italic>Maharam Shik</italic>, observation of a post-mortem procedure obviates the need to expend funds in an endeavor to obtain that information in some other manner.<sup><xref rid="fn554">5</xref></sup> <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>, however, seems to imply that it is the knowledge <italic>per se</italic> that constitutes the forbidden benefit.<sup><xref rid="fn555">6</xref></sup></p>
<h2>C. &#x201C;<italic>Unusual</italic>&#x201D; <italic>Benefit</italic></h2>
<p>R. Yitzchak Arieli, <italic>No&#x2019;am</italic>, VI (5723), <italic>Torah she-be-&#x2018;al Peh</italic>, VI (5724), 48, suggests that examination of a cadaver for scientific purposes constitutes an &#x201C;unusual&#x201D; form of benefit and hence is permitted. In doing so he relies upon R. David ibn Zimra, <italic>Teshuvot Radvaz</italic>, III, no. 548, who maintains that only &#x201C;usual&#x201D; forms of benefit may not be derived from a cadaver.<sup><xref rid="fn556">7</xref></sup> Presumably, the concept of a &#x201C;usual&#x201D; benefit in association with a cadaver is the type of benefit that might be considered ordinary and usual were the cadaver regarded as no more deserving of respect than carrion. Flesh of dead animals can readily be used as dog food. Cadaveric flesh is not put to such ignominious use because of innate recognition of the value of human dignity. Since even bodies of animals are seldom used for scientific purposes, argues Rabbi Arieli, use of a cadaver in that manner is &#x201C;unusual.&#x201D;</p>
<p>However, R. Akiva Eger, <italic>Gilyon ha-Shas</italic>, <italic>Avodah Zarah</italic> 12b and <italic>&#x1E24;iddushei R</italic>. <italic>Akiva Eger</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 349:1, disagrees with the principle formulated by Radvaz. In general, prohibitions against deriving benefit from designated substances are associated with commandments couched in terms of &#x201C;eating&#x201D; and predicated upon talmudic exegesis demonstrating that &#x201C;eating,&#x201D; unless otherwise indicated, connotes other forms of pleasurable benefit as well. Accordingly, &#x201C;unusual&#x201D; benefit is not encompassed in the prohibition, just as &#x201C;unusual&#x201D; forms of eating are not subsumed within the connotation of a biblical commandment in the form of &#x201C;Thou shalt not eat.&#x201D; In contradistinction, the ban against deriving benefit from a corpse is not predicated upon an explicit admonition but is derived by talmudic exegesis on the basis of application of one of the hermeneutic principles of interpretation. Hence, asserts R. Akiva Eger, no distinction can be drawn between usual versus unusual forms of benefit. A similar position is espoused by <italic>Mishneh le-Melekh, Hilkhot Ma&#x2019;akhalot Assurot</italic> 14:10 and <italic>Hilkhot Avel</italic> 14:21.<sup><xref rid="fn557">8</xref></sup> The basic principle is codified by Rambam, <italic>loc. cit.,</italic> with regard to milk and meat that have been cooked together and with regard to the product of mixed species of grain and grapes that have been commingled in planting. A similar view is expressed by <italic>Tosafot</italic>, <italic>Avodah Zarah</italic> 12b and <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;im</italic> 26a, with regard to deified objects of pagan worship or sacrifice.</p>
<h2>D. <italic>Visual Benefit</italic></h2>
<p>The remaining factor to be considered is whether mere visual examination undertaken solely for aesthetic or recreational purposes constitutes a forbidden form of benefit. &#x201C;Benefit,&#x201D; in the fundamental halakhic meaning of the term, connotes tangible physical benefit such as eating, drinking, anointing the skin or financial enrichment. Thus, the Gemara, <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;im</italic> 26a, declares, &#x201C;Sound, sight and smell do not constitute <italic>me&#x2019;ilah</italic> (<italic>kol</italic>, <italic>mareh varea&#x1E25; ein ba-hen mishum me&#x2019;ilah</italic>).&#x201D; &#x201C;<italic>Me&#x2019;ilah</italic>&#x201D; refers to prohibited use of consecrated property for mundane benefit. In context, the Gemara is defining and limiting the concept of <italic>hana&#x2019;ah</italic>, or benefit. Although other forms of sensual pleasure do constitute <italic>hana&#x2019;ah</italic>, benefit derived by means of &#x201C;sight&#x201D; does not rise to the level of a prohibited &#x201C;benefit.&#x201D; The principle is made explicit with regard to the prohibitions concerning <italic>me&#x2019;ilah</italic> but, logically, it is equally applicable to all categories of <italic>issurei hana&#x2019;ah</italic>.</p>
<p>This, however, does not necessarily mean that such forms of <italic>hana&#x2019;ah</italic> are entirely innocuous and hence permissible. The talmudic statement &#x201C;<italic>ein ba-hen mishum me&#x2019;ilah</italic>&#x201D; serves only to establish that enjoyment of such benefit does not constitute a punishable infraction. Despite the fact that no punishable offense is engendered as a result of deriving benefit from &#x201C;sound, sight or smell,&#x201D; the act may yet remain prohibited, albeit unpunishable. Indeed, the Gemara, <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;im</italic> 26a, declares explicitly that derivation of such benefit does constitute an infraction of Jewish law. That prohibition is recorded by Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Me&#x2019;ilah</italic> 5:16. Nevertheless, <italic>Tosafot</italic>, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 21a, cite a statement of the Gemara, <italic>Sukkah</italic> 53a, to the effect that a woman is permitted to sort kernels of wheat by the light illuminating festivities attendant upon the drawing of water on <italic>Sukkot</italic> (<italic>sim&#x1E25;at bet ha-sho&#x2019;evah</italic>). Illumination was provided by means of fuel purchased with consecrated funds devoted to defraying the cost of that celebration. The woman&#x2019;s activity is entirely secular and mundane. Although an alternate interpretation is suggested, <italic>Tosafot</italic> cite a comment of the Palestinian Talmud indicating that the woman&#x2019;s activity is entirely permissible,<sup><xref rid="fn558">9</xref></sup> i.e., that there is no prohibition whatsoever against deriving a benefit by means of &#x201C;sight&#x201D; from that which is otherwise <italic>asur be-hana&#x2019;ah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn559">10</xref></sup> However, even according to <italic>Tosafot</italic>, the Babylonian Talmud appears to prohibit benefit in the form of &#x201C;sound, sight or smell.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn560">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The prohibition concerning &#x201C;sight, sound and smell&#x201D; is not limited to benefit derived from consecrated property (<italic>hekdesh</italic>) but extends to other forms of <italic>issurei hana&#x2019;ah</italic> as well.<sup><xref rid="fn561">12</xref></sup> The issue with regard to forbidden forms of smell arises with regard to the prohibition against deriving benefit from <italic>&#x1E25;ame&#x1E93;</italic> on <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;</italic>. On <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;</italic>, may a Jew, knowingly and willingly, inhale the pleasant aroma of freshly baked bread? On the basis of a statement found in a gloss appended to <italic>Issur ve-Heter he-Arukh</italic> 39:33, it is clear that such pleasure is forbidden to a Jew on <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;</italic>. A similar ruling is recorded by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh ha-Rav</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 443:3, and <italic>Ma&#x2019;adanei Shmu&#x2019;el</italic> 113:2. Similarly, with regard to sight, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 142:15, rules that it is forbidden to enjoy the aesthetic pleasure derived from gazing upon an object of beauty if the <italic>objet d&#x2019;art</italic> is associated with idolatrous practices. Accordingly, it would follow that the prohibition against deriving benefit from a corpse would serve to prohibit even benefit derived solely from visual examination undertaken solely for aesthetic or recreational purposes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, R. Chaim Sofer, <italic>Teshuvot Ma&#x1E25;aneh &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, II, no. 60, cites a number of sources that clearly indicate that merely looking or gazing upon objects from which it is forbidden to derive benefit is permissible. Chief among those is the statement recorded by the Gemara, <italic>Yoma</italic> 21b, declaring that upon removing the week-old shewbread that remained fresh despite having been exposed upon the table for an entire week it was held up and displayed before the entire assemblage with the declaration, &#x201C;Behold, how you are cherished by the Almighty&#x0021;&#x201D; Gazing upon the shewbread and the table was clearly permitted despite the fact that they were consecrated objects. <italic>Ma&#x1E25;aneh &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> also cites the report recorded in <italic>Ketubot</italic> 103a of how, after his death, R. Judah the Prince appeared to his family every Friday evening despite the fact that the members of his family certainly took great pleasure in those visits. Although it is presumably the case that R. Judah did not appear in a physical state, <italic>Ma&#x1E25;aneh &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> apparently assumes otherwise and cites that narrative as establishing that benefit derived from merely gazing upon a cadaver is permissible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <italic>Ma&#x1E25;aneh &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> himself counseled that consecrated oil and wicks cannot be used to provide illumination for mundane purposes. If, for example, such light is used only to facilitate study and the acquisition of knowledge, how does it differ from witnessing an anatomical dissection? Although the distinction is not made explicitly by <italic>Ma&#x1E25;aneh &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, he may have intended to distinguish between &#x201C;sight&#x201D; (<italic>mar&#x2019;eh</italic>) in the sense of illumination and &#x201C;sight&#x201D; as a means of acquiring information. <italic>Ma&#x1E25;aneh &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> apparently regards illumination enabling a person to see properly as a form of proscribed sensual benefit whereas <italic>histaklut</italic>, or visual examination, yielding intellectual benefit, or emotional benefit as in the case of the shewbread, that is entirely non-corporeal and non-sensual in nature, he regards as permissible.</p>
<p>Putting <italic>Ma&#x1E25;aneh &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>&#x2019;s permissive view aside, those authorities who forbid participation in post-mortem examination must perforce recognize that exhibition of the shewbread was not only permitted but meritorious despite the satisfaction and pleasure associated with the visual experience. That pleasure must have been intense and was occasioned only by the event, but such pleasure was not the result of the transfer of anything tangible or intangible from the shewbread to the perceiver. God&#x2019;s love of Israel and even the preserved freshness of the shewbread were already known to all; the experience conveyed no new information. &#x201C;A picture is worth a thousand words&#x201D; because, ofttimes, visual perception generates an emotional experience that mere intellectual awareness does not produce. But that emotional experience and any accompanying pleasure arises reflexively in the psyche. The external event is merely a catalyst rather than the efficient cause of the resultant emotional pleasure. That form of benefit is permissible whereas benefit in the form of scientific knowledge imparted by examination of a prohibited object may well be forbidden.</p>
<h2>E. <italic>Indirect Benefit</italic></h2>
<p>As noted earlier, <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> and <italic>Maharam Shik</italic> regard the use of cadavers for the study of anatomy as forbidden because of the intellectual benefit derived from that activity. R. Meir Shapiro, <italic>Or ha-Me&#x2019;ir</italic>, no. 74, deems the benefit derived to be instrumental in nature rather than a benefit in itself. The student or physician observing the dissection, he asserts, does not benefit from the observation until he applies the knowledge gained thereby in the treatment of a patient. Such instrumental benefit, he contends, is not forbidden. A similar view is expressed by R. Zevi Pesach Frank, <italic>Teshuvot Har &#x1E92;evi</italic>, no. 278. Apparently, both <italic>Or ha-Meir</italic> and <italic>Har &#x1E92;evi</italic> do not deem mere acquisition of medical knowledge to be a prohibited form of &#x201C;benefit.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn562">13</xref></sup></p>
<h2>F. <italic>Passive Benefit</italic></h2>
<p>R. Mordecai Winkler, <italic>Teshuvot Levushei Mordekhai</italic>, <italic>Mahadura Telita&#x2019;ah</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 29, rules that benefit derived passively, i.e., without an overt act, for the ultimate purpose of fulfilling a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>, i.e., treatment of the patient, is not prohibited. <italic>Teshuvot Kol Eliyahu</italic>, II, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 23, regards the prohibition against visual benefit to be limited to benefit derived from consecrated property but entirely permissible with regard to other prohibited objects. This may well be the position of <italic>Bet Yosef</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 224, as well. These various opinions have been discussed in detail in <italic>Contemporary Halakhic Problems</italic>, IV, 227-233.</p>
<h1>IV. <italic>Conclusions</italic></h1>
<p>It must also be stated that anatomical dissections pose a problem only for the medical student whose knowledge and understanding of the nature and structure of the human body is greatly enhanced by the experience. There is little reason to assume that a maintenance employee may not pause in the course of mopping the floor to gaze at the dissection by peering over the shoulder of the medical student. The experience will not contribute to the edification of the maintenance worker for he is likely to have learned absolutely nothing. Observation of such a procedure is certainly not a source of aesthetic gratification.</p>
<p>For a serious and engaged student a visit to &#x201C;Body Worlds&#x201D; would undoubtedly be a learning experience. For a person seeking a recreational activity it may well prove to be no more than a macabre experience and hence devoid of halakhic complexity.</p>
<p>Despite the earlier cited differences of opinion among rabbinic authorities there is at least one talmudic statement that seems to confirm the permissibility of deriving information from examination of cadavers. The Gemara, <italic>Bekhorot</italic> 45a, recounts that the students of R. Ishmael obtained the body of a harlot who had been executed by civil authorities and boiled the cadaver in order to determine the number of organs in the human body. Similarly, the Gemara, <italic>Niddah</italic> 24b, relates that Abba Sha&#x2019;ul said of himself that at an earlier period in his life he was professionally involved in the burial of the dead and that it was his wont to scrutinize the bones of the diseased. As a result of his examinations he discovered that &#x201C;The bones of one who drinks undiluted wine are burned; those of one who drinks properly diluted wine are black (or dry, according to the second explanation of Rashi). The bones of one whose drinking exceeds his eating are burned; [those of one] whose eating exceeds his drinking are black (or dry); [those of one who eats and drinks] properly are [moist with] oil.&#x201D; Elsewhere, the Gemara, <italic>Nazir</italic> 52a, addresses a question pertaining to ritual defilement that hinges upon whether a number of spinal vertebrae come from a single cadaver or from the corpses of a multiple number of individuals. The Gemara relates that a container full of bones was brought to the synagogue. Thereupon a certain Theodos the Physician entered the synagogue accompanied by &#x201C;all the physicians.&#x201D; Upon examining the bones they declared that the vertebrae did not come from a single spinal column. R. Mordecai Winkler, <italic>Teshuvot Levushei Mordekhai</italic>, <italic>Mahadura Telita&#x2019;ah</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, no. 29, cites this narrative and questions how it was possible for Theodos and his colleagues to make such a determination unless they had previously studied the shape and configuration of vertebrae in other cadavers. These sources serve to establish one of two halakhic principles: either (1) there exists no prohibition against deriving benefit from the corpse of a non-Jew, as <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> does in fact deduce on the basis of <italic>Bekhorot</italic> 45a; or (2) mere examination of a cadaver does not constitute a forbidden form of <italic>hana&#x2019;ah</italic>.</p>
<p>Thus, it may be concluded that visual examination of a non-Jewish cadaver is not forbidden by any rabbinic decisor. The cadavers prepared for these purposes in China are assuredly those of non-Jews. Although, as noted earlier, a Jew is forbidden to accept payment for viewing a cadaver, non-Jews are not bound by the prohibition of deriving benefit from a corpse. Since the promoters profiting financially from these enterprises appear to be non-Jewish, the payment of admission fees does not constitute placing of a stumbling block before them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the endeavor is odious in the extreme. The absence of a formal interdiction does not serve to render a practice innocuous in nature. Commercial exploitation of human remains and its acceptance by the public at large is one example of the depravity of the age in which we live. Refusal to become complicit in the moral degeneration of society by personal participation and financial support is certainly an appropriate Jewish reaction.</p>

<ftnote id="fn553">4. Cf., <italic>infra</italic>, note 13 and accompanying text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn554">5. <italic>Maharam Shik</italic> was certainly under a misimpression. Knowledge and skill derived from performing anatomical dissections cannot be obtained from textbooks or from tutors. Even more significantly, <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic>&#x2019;s comments address a question presented much earlier to <italic>Noda bi-Yehuda</italic>. See R. Ezekiel Landau, <italic>Teshuvot Noda bi-Yehudah</italic>, <italic>Mahadura Tinyana</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic>, no. 210. That situation involved an unsuccessful surgical procedure that was apparently in its infancy. The autopsy was sought in order to learn how to make the abdominal incision smaller and more precise. That information was as yet unknown and hence could not have been acquired in another manner by expending funds for that purpose.</ftnote>
<ftnote><italic>Maharam Shik</italic>&#x2019;s thesis is, however, relevant in our day. Proposals have been advanced for eliminating the use of human cadavers and replacing them with replicas made of synthetic materials. Moreover, computer technology has made possible high-resolution, three-dimensional representations of human tissues and organs. Computerized scans and three-dimensional recreations of the human body provide more efficient, albeit more expensive, teaching tools than dissection of actual cadavers. See <italic>New York Times</italic>, March 23, 2004, p. F1. Hence, today, use of a human cadaver does serve to obviate the expense of acquiring such knowledge in other ways.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn555">6. Nevertheless, <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> would presumably agree that in the case of the Torah scroll the prohibited benefit is financial in nature since fulfillment of a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> does not in itself constitute a &#x201C;benefit.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn556">7. A permissive view with regard to &#x201C;unusual&#x201D; benefit is also espoused by R. Chaim Sofer, <italic>Teshuvot Ma&#x1E25;aneh &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, II, no. 60. Cf., R. Jacob Ettlinger, <italic>Teshuvot Binyan &#x1E92;ion</italic>, no. 119, who is concerned with retention in one&#x2019;s possession of an object from which it is forbidden to derive benefit because of the danger of inadvertent transgression but does not raise the issue of whether deriving scientific benefit constitutes a form of forbidden benefit.</ftnote>

Accordingly, use of the illumination provided by the <italic>sim&#x1E25;at bet ha-sho&#x2019;evah</italic> served to obviate the need for expenditure of funds for that purpose. If so, <italic>Maharam Shik</italic>&#x2019;s contention that obviating the need for expenditure of funds constitutes a forbidden form of benefit is not consistent with the position of the Palestinian Talmud.

<title><italic>Chapter 14</italic> A &#x0024;25,000,000 Funeral</title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>Joseph was privileged to bury his father and among his brothers there is none greater than he</italic>.</p>
<p align="blockquote">SOTAH 9b</p>
<h1>I. <italic>The Narrative</italic></h1>
<p>Some time ago, an intriguing tale of a son willing to forfeit a &#x0024;25,000,000 inheritance in order to assure that his father be accorded a Jewish burial spread rapidly in observant circles. A report of the incident was published in a popular magazine, <italic>Mishpacha</italic>, no. 87 (20 Kislev, 5766). More recently, the story, accepted as factually correct, became the basis of a halakhic discussion of the son&#x2019;s obligation in that matter.</p>
<p>In the European journal, <italic>Kol ha-Torah</italic>, no. 61(Nisan 5766), R. Yitzchak Zilberstein recounts the details of the incident. Sometime prior to World War II a European Jew married a Jewish woman and they were blessed with the birth of a son. Shortly afterwards the war broke out and the wife was killed. The husband was saved by a gentile woman who declared him to be her husband. They lived together and became the parents of a baby boy. The Jewish son, born of the first marriage, somehow managed to survive but had no contact with his father.</p>
<p>Many years later, the story goes, the Jewish son received notification of the death of his father and of the fact that the father had left an estate of &#x0024;50,000,000 of which he, as one of two surviving children, was entitled to receive a half. Each of the two sons demanded the right to determine burial arrangements. The Jewish son sought to have his father buried in a Jewish cemetery; the non-Jewish son demanded that his father be buried in a non-Jewish cemetery next to his gentile mother. The issue, we are told, became the subject of litigation in a civil court. The court allegedly ruled, rather Solomonically, that the body be cremated and the ashes be apportioned among the two heirs.<sup><xref rid="fn563">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Jewish son&#x2019;s attorney advised his client to offer a million dollar settlement in return for the exclusive right to dispose of his father&#x2019;s remains in accordance with Jewish practice.<sup><xref rid="fn564">2</xref></sup> The non-Jewish son presented a counteroffer: He surmised that if the Jewish son&#x2019;s concern warranted the expenditure of such a large sum it probably was worth an even greater financial sacrifice. Accordingly, he demanded that the Jewish son relinquish his claim to their father&#x2019;s estate in its entirety, i.e., he demanded his brother&#x2019;s entire &#x0024;25,000,000 share of the inheritance in return for acquiescing to a Jewish burial. The Jewish son, we are told, agreed and the father received a proper Jewish burial.</p>
<h1>II. <italic>Burial Expenses as a Charge Against the Estate</italic></h1>
<p>Rabbi Zilberstein addresses the question of whether the Jewish son was indeed obligated to incur a loss of that magnitude in order to fulfill the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> of honoring his father. Indeed, as codified by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 240:5, that commandment, strictly speaking, is limited to provision of assistance with personal needs but does not require the son to spend his own funds. As explicitly stated by Rema, <italic>ad locum</italic>, the duty to provide financial assistance to an impoverished father is in the nature of a charitable obligation. Since the son had already succeeded to his share of the estate, he was, in effect, being asked to expend his own fortune in order to honor his father.</p>
<p>Rabbi Zilberstein quite correctly counters that such an analysis would be incorrect. As in other systems of law, necessary and appropriate burial expenses constitute a charge against the estate. In effect, the heirs do not succeed to the portion of the estate required to defray the costs of burial. That point can be substantiated on the basis of a number of sources. <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, &#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 253:30 and <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 348:2, rules that a person cannot leave his estate to his heirs and allow himself to be buried at communal expense. If bequests were made to other beneficiaries but the residue of the estate is left to the heirs, the heirs must use their residual share to cover costs of the funeral.</p>
<p><italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 348:3, explains that a person lacks authority to conserve his own assets in order to enrich his heirs when such a course of action causes him to become a burden upon the community. R. Joshua Falk, <italic>Sema</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 253:70, explains that property that passes by inheritance remains vested in the progenitor &#x201C;who is to be buried from his own&#x201D; resources. The same author, <italic>Perishah</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 253:48, declares:</p>
<p align="blockquote">Property of the deceased is encumbered for collection of burial needs. Even if he declares before death that he does not wish to be buried, he is not heeded; rather, the <italic>bet din</italic> is obligated to seize his property and bury him. <italic>A fortiori</italic>, they may seize funds left to heirs [even] against their will.</p>
<p>Although not cited by Rabbi Zilberstein, that thesis is also supported by the comments of R. Pinchas ha-Levi Horowitz, <italic>Hafla&#x2019;ah, Ketubot</italic> 95b. <italic>Hafla&#x2019;ah</italic> draws attention to Rashi&#x2019;s comment on the ruling recorded in the Mishnah requiring the heirs of a widow to pay the expenses of her burial. Rashi explains that, since a widow has no husband who is responsible for her burial expenses, &#x201C;she must bury herself.&#x201D; Accordingly, <italic>Hafla&#x2019;ah</italic>, both <italic>ad locum</italic> and in his <italic>Kuntres A&#x1E25;aron</italic> 89:1, concludes that the husband&#x2019;s creditors, including those whose liens preceded the marriage, although they may seize property inherited by the husband from his wife to satisfy his debts, cannot seize the portion of the wife&#x2019;s estate necessary to pay the costs of the wife&#x2019;s burial. In effect, the husband does not succeed to the portion of his wife&#x2019;s estate necessary to defray her burial expenses.</p>
<p>Rabbi Zilberstein concludes that, since the son&#x2019;s inheritance passes to him subject to the father&#x2019;s responsibility for his own burial expenses, the son has no choice but to forego his inheritance in order to assure the proper burial of his father&#x2019;s remains.<sup><xref rid="fn565">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>That analysis is unexceptionable and indeed quite obvious insofar as it goes. Burial expenses are indeed primarily the responsibility of the deceased and constitute a lien against his estate. But left unexamined by Rabbi Zilberstein is the extent to which a person must provide for the costs of his own burial and hence the extent of the resultant encumbrance upon his estate.</p>
<h1>III. <italic>The Nature of the Charge Against the Estate</italic></h1>
<p>Moreover, demonstrating that heirs do not acquire title to the portion of the estate required to satisfy burial expenses does not explain why that should be so. Halakhah accepts the principle that property cannot be conveyed to a cadaver because only a living human being can be seized of property.<sup><xref rid="fn566">4</xref></sup> Property cannot be vested in a chimpanzee, a goldfish or an inanimate object, including a human corpse. For that reason property must pass to heirs immediately at the moment of death and the deceased, even while yet alive, cannot enter into a conveyance that is to be given effect even a moment after his death. How, then, can title to funds needed for burial expenses be retained by the deceased?</p>
<p>Although property cannot remain vested in a person&#x2019;s body after his demise, liens against real property travel with the land. That is so because a lien is essentially a property interest acquired immediately upon generation of the lien. That which a person does not own he cannot transfer to another by sale, gift or inheritance. Hence, all successors to title acquire title subject to existing liens.</p>
<p>The nature of a person&#x2019;s obligation to defray his own burial expenses, and hence of the lien it generates against his estate, is somewhat unclear. A person cannot have an obligation to pay for his burial based upon his own obligation to fulfill the commandment &#x201C;and you shall surely bury him on that day&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 21:23), and certainly not one that survives his demise, for the obvious reason that &#x201C;once a person dies he is free of the Torah and commandments&#x201D; (<italic>Shabbat</italic> 30a, <italic>Shabbat</italic> 151b and <italic>Niddah</italic> 61b).</p>
<p>The Gemara, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 46b, describes the obligation to bury the dead as a biblical commandment and then proceeds to record a controversy with regard to the underlying rationale. One opinion is that burial is required as a means of <italic>kapparah</italic>, i.e., atonement or expiation. Disintegration of the body and return to the dust from which it was formed serves as expiation of sin. The second opinion maintains that the rationale underlying the requirement of interment of human remains is a need to avoid <italic>bizyona</italic>, i.e., the ignominy that would result from putrefaction were the corpse to remain unburied.</p>
<p>The Gemara indicates that the controversy is not merely theoretical; it leads to cancellation of the obligation in one particular situation, <italic>viz</italic>., an instance in which the deceased indicated prior to his death that he did not wish to be buried. In that case, explains Rashi, the deceased has renounced the benefit afforded by decomposition and, even if buried, will not be accorded the benefit he has renounced. Hence, burial would be purposeless.<sup><xref rid="fn567">5</xref></sup> That, however, is not the case if the purpose of interment is to avoid indignity to the corpse. As <italic>Tosafot, ad locum</italic>, point out, although the deceased has renounced his own claim to dignity, it is not only his honor and dignity that are compromised but the honor and dignity of his entire family. Of course, all surviving family members may also concur and renounce their own individual claims to dignity. Nevertheless, as stated by Ramban in his <italic>Torat ha-Adam</italic><sup><xref rid="fn568">6</xref></sup> and cited by <italic>Kesef Mishneh, Hilkhot Avel</italic> 12:1, the honor and dignity to which reference is made is not simply that of individual family members but the honor and dignity of the entire human race and hence the survivors have no authority to forego the honor that must be accorded to the corpse. A person may well disdain atonement and may well be disposed to renounce his own honor and dignity. Nevertheless, even an expressly announced directive not to be buried must be ignored because a person has no right to compromise the honor and dignity of his family or of the human community. Both Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Avel</italic> 12:1,<sup><xref rid="fn569">7</xref></sup> and <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 348:3, rule that a person must be interred even if he has directed otherwise.</p>
<p>When seen as dishonor of the entire human race, the obligation with regard to interment assumes an entirely different guise. Partners in an enterprise assume responsibilities <italic>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</italic> one another that are actionable against property owned by them. Townspeople may compel one another to provide certain amenities, e.g., a wall around the city and fortifications, because in forming a society they enter into a partnership and impliedly agree that they will be financially responsible to one another for such costs. Such undertakings give rise to a lien against property. Similarly, members of society become responsible, not only for maintaining their own personal honor and dignity, but for preserving the human dignity of all fellow members of society, i.e., of mankind at large. Integral to that obligation is the responsibility to provide for proper disposal of one&#x2019;s own body after death so that the ignominy inherent in putrefaction not become an embarrassment and a negative reflection upon mankind at large. The responsibility to prevent one&#x2019;s corpse from becoming a rebuke to society devolves upon every member of the human race by virtue of his or her status as a member of human society. That obligation, although it is discharged only after death, devolves upon a person during his lifetime in the sense that his property becomes hypothecated for purposes of defraying the necessary costs of burial. The obligation is toward other members of society; they, in turn, are beneficiaries of a lien upon the property of each fellow member of society for satisfaction of that contractual obligation. Any property acquired by a member of society is acquired subject to such lien.</p>
<p>Accordingly, to declare that heirs do not succeed to the portion of the estate required to defray burial expenses is not to imply that such funds remain vested in the corpse in a literal sense; it is to say only that such funds are inherited subject to the existing lien for defrayal of burial expenses. Hence the prerogative of enforcing that responsibility may be exercised by the beneficiaries of that lien, i.e., society at large, in order to force heirs to disgorge property encumbered for that purpose.<sup><xref rid="fn570">8</xref></sup></p>
<h1>IV. <italic>The Controversy Between</italic> Ba&#x1E25; <italic>and</italic> Rosh</h1>
<p>Nevertheless, <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rosh, klal</italic> 15, chap. 3, rules that a creditor may seize the assets of an estate in their entirety and is not required to provide for the burial of the deceased. That position is reflected in the ruling of Rema, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 107:2. <italic>Tur Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 255:2, similarly rules that a widow who seizes the entire estate in satisfaction of her <italic>ketubah</italic> has no obligation to provide for the burial of her deceased husband. <italic>Ba&#x1E25;</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 275:4, clearly understood that there exists a lien against the property of a deceased for the defrayment of burial expenses and that a lien of such nature generates an encumbrance upon the property of the deceased during his lifetime. Accordingly, he questions why the claims of a creditor or of a widow are not subordinate to the prior lien imposed on a person&#x2019;s property for payment of burial expenses. <italic>Ba&#x1E25;</italic> responds that the creditor is regarded as already in possession of the property from the moment that the debt was generated. A similar situation does not exist with regard to burial expenses; title to property used to pay burial expenses does not vest in any other party during the lifetime of the deceased. For that reason <italic>Ba&#x1E25;</italic> rules that, although the property of a proselyte who has no heirs becomes <italic>res nullius</italic> upon his death, nevertheless, no one can acquire title to the portion of his estate necessary to cover costs of interment.<sup><xref rid="fn571">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>That position, however, is contradicted by <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</italic> and <italic>Tur Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>ad locum</italic>, as well as by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 275:2. Citing <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</italic>, <italic>Tur Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> declares that the proselyte&#x2019;s property becomes <italic>res nullius</italic> immediately upon his death and that there exists no lien for payment of burial expenses &#x201C;for this lien did not become effective [during his] lifetime.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rosh&#x2019;s</italic> position as well as his explanatory comment regarding the non-existence of a lien for defrayment of burial expenses are consistent with the thesis that such a lien does indeed exist. In this writer&#x2019;s opinion, <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</italic> should be understood as denying only existence of a lien for burial expenses that comes into existence prior to generation of a lien in favor of the creditor or of the widow, i.e., contrary to <italic>Ba&#x1E25;</italic>, Rosh maintains that the inception of the lien is not at the moment of birth or at the time that a person reaches the age of halakhic majority. Rather, Rosh maintains that the lien comes into existence at the moment of death, rather than much earlier during the lifetime of the deceased, with the result that both creditors and the widow are senior creditors and hence bear no responsibility for burial of the deceased. This analysis is supported by the comments of <italic>Perishah</italic>, <italic>Tur &#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 275:4, who declares that &#x201C;the title of one who takes title to the property of a proselyte is by virtue of rabbinic decree and he acquires title [to the property] before departure of the soul.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn572">10</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Perishah</italic> clearly explains that the proselyte&#x2019;s title is extinguished by rabbinic decree <italic>before</italic> death (as evidenced by the fact that the person acquiring title may not have performed an act of <italic>kinyan</italic> until after the demise of the proselyte) and is not liable for his own burial expenses because no lien is established for that purpose until later, i.e., at the time of death. This analysis is also reflected in the terminology employed by <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</italic>. In explaining why a creditor may attach the entire estate, Rosh declares: &#x201C;It appears that immediately upon the death of the proselyte his possessions become <italic>res nullius</italic> and we do not find that a lien [to provide] for his burial rests upon a lien against his property.&#x201D; Rosh does not state simply that there exists no lien with regard to burial expenses; rather, he states that no such lien &#x201C;rests upon a lien against his property,&#x201D; i.e., it does not constitute a pre-existing lien having priority over the creditor&#x2019;s lien.</p>
<p>Rosh&#x2019;s position in this regard is entirely understandable. The obligation of burial by virtue of <italic>bizyona</italic>, if understood as an obligation devolving upon an individual as a member of society, is analogous to similar obligations of that nature. The obligation of townspeople to contribute to the erection of fortifications and to provide for social amenities is assumed upon becoming a resident of the city but there is certainly no actionable lien against property until a tax is actually levied. Such a levy could presumably not be collected from a creditor who forecloses on a prior lien. Similarly, financial obligations assumed in the guise of human dignity or <italic>kevod ha-beriyyot</italic> are not actionable and do not serve to encumber property until an actual need arises, i.e., until the person actually expires.<sup><xref rid="fn573">11</xref></sup></p>
<h1>V. <italic>A Child&#x2019;s Obligation</italic></h1>
<p>Rabbi Zilberstein&#x2019;s analysis of a child&#x2019;s obligation to bury a parent is less than comprehensive. Indeed, the obligation to honor a parent in death as in life does not mandate expenditure by the child of his personal funds. However, apart from the obligation of honoring one&#x2019;s father there are additional commandments concerning burial, <italic>viz</italic>., the negative prohibition against allowing a corpse to remain unburied and the positive obligation to provide timely burial as commanded in Deuteronomy 21:23. When the deceased has no assets, those obligations do require expenditure of personal funds by others to the same extent as is required for the fulfillment of other commandments. It is certainly arguable that those obligations devolve first and foremost upon the decedent&#x2019;s relatives. Moreover, although the obligation of filial honor does not give rise to a financial burden devolving upon the son, the son may well have a charitable obligation to defray the financial needs of an impecunious parent.</p>
<p>Whether or not a son is obligated to expend his own funds to defray burial expenses is a matter of some controversy. <italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 348:5, states that if the heirs inherit no funds they cannot be compelled to pay for burial of the deceased; rather, declares <italic>Shakh</italic>, &#x201C;it is incumbent upon everyone to bury him.&#x201D; <italic>Shakh</italic> apparently maintains that in such circumstances the obligation devolves upon the entire community.</p>
<p>An eighteenth-century authority, R. Zevi Hirsh ben Ezriel of Vilna, <italic>Bet Le&#x1E25;em Yehudah</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 348:2, addressed a situation involving a pauper who died but who had a wealthy son. The <italic>&#x1E25;evra kaddisha</italic> demanded a high fee from the son for burial in accordance with the son&#x2019;s social station. <italic>Bet Le&#x1E25;em Yehudah</italic> ruled that the obligation is to bury the father in accordance with his social station and, accordingly, the fee due and owing is to be assessed in accordance with the economic status of the deceased rather than of his surviving relatives. Accordingly, <italic>Bet Le&#x1E25;em Yehudah</italic> ruled that the son may rightfully refuse to pay a higher amount and the <italic>&#x1E25;evra kaddisha</italic> incurs a transgression if it delays burial on that account.</p>
<p><italic>Bet Le&#x1E25;em Yehudah</italic> clearly disagrees with <italic>Shakh</italic>&#x2019;s position. Although the obligation to honor one&#x2019;s parent does not ordinarily entail a financial obligation, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 240:5, rules that if the parent is impoverished and the son is financially capable of doing so, the son may be compelled to support a parent. Since the burial is designed for the honor of the deceased, argues <italic>Bet Le&#x1E25;em Yehudah</italic>, a son may be compelled to bear the costs of a funeral, just as he may be compelled to provide for other needs of an impoverished parent. A parent, and indeed other relatives as well, must be accorded priority in the allocation of charitable funds. Although <italic>Bet Le&#x1E25;em Yehudah</italic> regards the son to be financially liable for the burial expenses of his father, he maintains that the financial liability of the son is limited to outlays for accouterments appropriate to the father&#x2019;s social status. It would certainly follow that the son need not expend a sum greater than the total amount he might be required to dispense as charity.</p>
<p><italic>Bet Le&#x1E25;em Yehudah</italic> concedes that <italic>Shakh</italic> rules that a son need not expend his own funds in burying his father and ascribes the same position to <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rosh, klal</italic> 13, chap. 18, as well as to <italic>Tur Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic>, <italic>Even ha-Ezer</italic> 118. Nevertheless, <italic>Bet Le&#x1E25;em Yehudah</italic> points to the rulings of <italic>Teshuvot Ra&#x2019;avan</italic>, no. 23 and <italic>Teshuvot Maharam Min&#x1E93;</italic>, no. 54, cited by R. Jacob Reischer, <italic>Teshuvot Min&#x1E25;at Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>, no. 8, indicating that fulfillment of the commandment regarding burial is a personal obligation of the son and, as such, requires expenditure of his own funds in order to accord his father a funeral in accordance with the honor and dignity of the deceased. <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> further argues that no inference should be drawn from <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</italic> to the effect that <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</italic> intended to limit the obligation of a son to situations in which the father left an estate. <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> asserts that there is no early-day authority who contests his position.</p>
<p><italic>Bet Le&#x1E25;em Yehudah&#x2019;s</italic> ruling to the effect that a son&#x2019;s responsibility is limited to payment of no more than what would have been customary and usual for a grave appropriate for a person of the father&#x2019;s social station were the payment made by the deceased himself may well be an equitable assessment of the charges the <italic>&#x1E25;evra kaddisha</italic> may morally impose upon him. The &#x0024;25,000,000 demanded by the non-Jewish son is certainly no different from exorbitant charges imposed by a <italic>&#x1E25;evra kaddisha</italic> and neither may be mandated by reason of a filial obligation of charity. However, according to Ra&#x2019;avan and <italic>Maharam Min&#x1E93;</italic>, who maintain that heirs are obligated to defray burial expenses by virtue of the biblical obligation to bury the dead, the son may not be relieved of his obligation concerning burial and <italic>halanat ha-met</italic>, i.e., allowing the corpse to remain unburied overnight, in a situation in which the <italic>&#x1E25;evra kaddisha</italic> or any other individual attempts to extort an exaggerated sum in order to permit proper burial.</p>
<h1>VI. <italic>Obligation of the Heirs</italic></h1>
<p><italic>Teshuvot Maharam Min&#x1E93;</italic>, no. 54, asserts that, since the biblical obligation of burial is rooted in the concept of <italic>bizyona</italic>, the obligation devolves not only upon a son but upon all heirs who would themselves suffer ignominy if their relative were to be left unburied. Maharam Min&#x1E93; rules that heirs are financially obligated to defray burial expenses to the same extent that they must expend funds for fulfillment of any positive obligation.<sup><xref rid="fn574">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Maharam Min&#x1E93; further cites a responsum of Ra&#x2019;avan, T<italic>eshuvot Ra&#x2019;avan</italic>, no. 33, who demonstrates that the biblical obligation of burial is incumbent upon relatives on the basis of two considerations:</p>
<p>1) The Gemara, <italic>Yevamot</italic> 89b, defines a <italic>met mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>, i.e., an unattended corpse on whose behalf even a <italic>kohen</italic> must defile himself in order to bury the remains, as a corpse found in circumstances in which even &#x201C;if one were to call, no one would respond on his behalf.&#x201D; The inference is that, if relatives do exist, they would be obligated to respond and the obligation of burial would devolve upon them. In rebuttal, <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> points out that the ensuing discussion of the Gemara might be understood as defining &#x201C;response&#x201D; as limited to the response of heirs who actually inherit the estate.</p>
<p>2) A <italic>kohen</italic> is required to defile himself through contact with seven biblically enumerated relatives. Clearly, argues Ra&#x2019;avan, he must be obligated to assure the burial of such relatives; else, what purpose would be served by his defilement? <italic>Min&#x1E25;at Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> responds to that argument by pointing to the ruling of <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 373:3, regarding a widow who is the daughter of a <italic>kohen</italic>. A widow has no obligation to bury her husband. Nevertheless, <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> rules that the daughter of a <italic>kohen</italic>, no less so than a <italic>kohen</italic> himself, is obligated to defile herself through contact with her husband&#x2019;s corpse.<sup><xref rid="fn575">13</xref></sup> In that case, the requirement of defilement certainly is not a concomitant of an obligation of burial.</p>
<p>R. Ya&#x2019;ir Chaim Bacharach, <italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>, no. 139, is in basic agreement with the position of Maharam Min&#x1E93;. However, <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> asserts that, insofar as apportionment of the financial burden is concerned, not only sons, but also other relatives and even persons living in relatively close proximity to the deceased, should be assessed a larger portion of the costs than others. <italic>&#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> declares that, since burial is predicated upon the concept of <italic>bizyona</italic>, the potential embarrassment to relatives and townspeople is greater than to others. Accordingly, he reasons that, were the corpse to remain unburied, such individuals would suffer greater embarrassment than others and hence they should bear a greater share of the costs.</p>
<p>The question of whether heirs are under financial obligation to defray funeral costs out of their own pockets would appear to be reflected in two resolutions of a problem presented by <italic>Tosafot, Bava Batra</italic> 154b. The Gemara discusses an incident involving a young man who disposed of property and then died and was buried. The validity of the sale was in doubt because it was unknown whether or not he had reached halakhic maturity as evidenced by the presence of pubic hairs. Opening the grave in order to examine the corpse involves dishonor to the deceased. Nevertheless, the Gemara declares that the purchasers who have paid for the property have a <italic>prima facia</italic> right to demand such examination in order to have the property delivered to them and thereby avoid financial loss. The Gemara explains why such a right cannot be exercised. However, in that discussion, the Gemara also addresses the situation of purchasers who are already in possession of the property and it is the heirs who seek to invalidate the sale in order to recover the property sold by their progenitor. Their claim is peremptorily dismissed and they are told, &#x201C;You have no right to desecrate [his body].&#x201D;</p>
<p>On the surface, both the purchasers and the heirs are claiming similar economic loss. Why, then, is the claim of the purchaser given serious consideration whereas the claim of the heirs is dismissed out of hand? <italic>Tosafot</italic> respond with the assertion that, whereas purchasers experience loss, heirs &#x201C;have given nothing.&#x201D; That distinction can best be understood in light of the thesis that a person&#x2019;s estate is hypothecated to defray any costs associated with dignified disposal of his remains. Included are not only the expenses of actual burial but any expenditure to prevent ignominious treatment of the corpse. To the extent that funds are needed for the purpose, heirs have no claim upon the estate. Thus the heirs &#x201C;have given nothing&#x201D; and cannot claim out-of-pocket loss.</p>
<p><italic>Tosafot</italic> then proceed to advance an alternative explanation: Unlike purchasers, &#x201C;the deceased is their relative.&#x201D; That explanation is not predicated upon a distinction between actual expenditure of funds and mere non-succession to an estate. Rather, in that explanation, <italic>Tosafot</italic> seem to assume an obligation on the part of relatives to expend their own funds in order to prevent desecration of the deceased and hence they are not able to plead financial loss in demanding examination of the already buried corpse in order to validate their claim to the purchased property.<sup><xref rid="fn576">14</xref></sup></p>
<h1>VII. <italic>Limitation of the Financial Obligation</italic></h1>
<p>The obligation to pay an exorbitant amount in order to assure burial of the remains of one&#x2019;s father should, logically, be similar to the obligation to pay an exorbitant amount for the purchase of a <italic>lulav</italic> and <italic>etrog</italic> or of <italic>ma&#x1E93;ot</italic> to fulfill those biblical commandments. The extent of the obligation to pay an extortionist in order to avoid transgression of <italic>halanat ha-met</italic> should, logically, be no different from the extent a person is obligated to expend even his entire fortune in order to avoid transgression of the negative commandment &#x201C;Thou shalt not stand idly by the blood of thy fellow&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:16). The general rule with regard to the expenditure of resources in order to avoid transgression as recorded by Rema, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 656:1, is that a person is not obligated to expend more than twenty percent of his net worth in order to fulfill, or to avoid transgressing, a positive commandment<sup><xref rid="fn577">15</xref></sup> but is obligated to expend even his entire fortune in order to avoid transgressing a negative precept.<sup><xref rid="fn578">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The extent of financial obligation that must be incurred in order to avoid passive transgression of a negative commandment is a matter of some controversy. As cited by <italic>&#x1E24;iddushei R. Akiva Eger</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 157:1 and <italic>Pit&#x1E25;ei Teshuvah</italic> 147:4,<sup><xref rid="fn579">17</xref></sup> some authorities maintain that, if the commandment is couched in negative terms, e.g., &#x201C;Thou shalt not stand idly by the blood of thy fellow,&#x201D; the financial obligation is the same as must be incurred in avoiding active violation, e.g., eating forbidden foods, and hence expenditure of even one&#x2019;s entire fortune is required. Other authorities cited in those sources maintain that the crucial distinction does not lie in the technical linguistic formulation of the commandment but in overt, active violation versus passive transgression and, since non-intervention in order to rescue a person from imminent death constitutes only passive transgression, the mandatory financial obligation is limited to one-tenth or one-fifth of one&#x2019;s fortune.<sup><xref rid="fn580">18</xref></sup> Applying that standard to the commandment &#x201C;Thou shall not allow his body [to remain unburied] overnight&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 21:23), a son charged with the burial of his father would be required by some authorities to expend his entire fortune but other authorities would require him to expend no more than one-tenth or one-fifth of his net worth.</p>
<p>This conclusion is somewhat at variance with the position of <italic>Bet Le&#x1E25;em Yehudah</italic> who fails to quantify the extent of a son&#x2019;s obligation other than in terms of the father&#x2019;s social status and, presumably, the extent of the son&#x2019;s obligation to make charitable gifts. Rabbi Zilberstein fails to recognize any filial obligation regarding burial over and above that of honoring one&#x2019;s father and, accordingly, finds no basis for financial responsibility grounded in that consideration.</p>
<p>It also stands to reason that the decedent&#x2019;s own obligation rooted in the concept of <italic>kevoda</italic>, i.e., preserving human dignity, is also not open-ended. <italic>Kevod ha-beriyyot</italic> is certainly a halakhic value; nevertheless, it is the consensus of rabbinic authorities that it does not constitute a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> in a technical sense. The author of <italic>Pri Megadim</italic>, in his <italic>Shoshanat ha-Amakim, klal</italic> 6, presents a lengthy analysis of that question. <italic>Shoshanat ha-Amakim</italic> notes that <italic>kevod ha-beriyyot</italic> is not enumerated as a commandment by any of the authorities who compiled lists of the 613 commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn581">19</xref></sup> Nevertheless, in certain limited circumstances, Halakhah stipulates that biblical prohibitions may be ignored for the sake of preserving human dignity.<sup><xref rid="fn582">20</xref></sup> Indeed, citing the declaration of the Gemara, <italic>Berakhot</italic> 19b, &#x201C;So great is <italic>kevod ha-beriyyot</italic> that it takes priority over a negative biblical commandment,&#x201D; <italic>Shoshanat ha-Amakim</italic> suggests that the &#x201C;greatness of <italic>kevod haberiyyot</italic> lies in the fact that it is accorded such weight even though it does not constitute a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn583">21</xref></sup> If <italic>kevod ha-beriyyot</italic> does not represent a formal <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> there is no immediate reason to assume that the financial burden mandated for the purpose of preserving human dignity is identical to that required for the purpose of fulfilling a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is one area of Jewish law in which <italic>kevod ha-beriyyot</italic> is expressed in financial terms. Return of lost property to its rightful owner represents a biblical obligation. However, the Gemara, <italic>Berakhot</italic> 19b, posits an exclusion from that obligation in the case of a &#x201C;scholar for whom it is not in accordance with his dignity,&#x201D; i.e., a person for whom the activity involved in rescuing a lost item in a particular set of circumstances would be demeaning or degrading. The exclusion is expressed in terms of a superseding need to preserve the dignity of the scholar.</p>
<p>Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Gezelah ve-Avedah</italic> 11:13, provides a simple test to determine the circumstances under which this exclusion pertains: the finder must examine his own conscience to ascertain whether he would subject himself to embarrassment or degradation to recover the object were it his own. The answer will certainly reflect a balance between the value of the object and the degree of degradation involved. If the finder would be willing to suffer similar embarrassment in order to avoid personal financial loss, he must accept the same measure of embarrassment in order to preserve the property of his fellow.</p>
<p>Clearly, then, people are prepared to suffer financial loss in order to preserve their dignity&#x2014;but they are not willing to accept unlimited financial loss for that end. Presumably, the financial loss people are willing to assume is commensurate with their social station and the degree of indignity involved. The dignity they are required to preserve is not simply personal dignity but <italic>kevod ha-beriyyot</italic>, dignity of the entire human race. As members of human society they have entered into a compact requiring them to expend personal funds in order to preserve <italic>kevod ha-beriyyot</italic>. Members of society are mutually and reciprocally obligated to preserve human dignity to the extent of the obligation assumed by virtue of having entered into that compact.</p>
<p>How much, then, must one expend in order not to appear naked in public? If the principle of <italic>kevod ha-beriyyot</italic> as applied to restoration of lost property serves as a paradigm, the answer is that one must expend as much as a normal, rational person of similar rank and station would expend to avoid such ignominy&#x2014;but one is not required to spend more than that amount. A person, as a member of society, has obligated himself to expend as much as other normal, rational and similarly situated persons would expend for that purpose. Since the obligation is reciprocal in nature it is limited to the degree to which such an undertaking can be imputed to others.</p>
<p>The same analysis applied to the factor of human dignity as a function of burial, rendering it a need and obligation of the deceased himself as well as of the society of human beings of which he was a member, would yield the result that such obligation cannot exceed the sum that normal, rational members of society would spend in order to avoid the ignominy of an unburied corpse. Although determination of the precise amount may be elusive, it may well be the case that it is significantly less than &#x0024;25,000,000.</p>
<p>A person is halakhically powerless to bequest his fortune to relatives and friends and expect that his dignity will be preserved at the expense of the public treasury. A person must provide for his needs, such as food, clothing and shelter, from his own funds when such funds are available. A person must also defray the costs of his own burial since avoidance of the ignominy of being left unburied is also a human need. The <italic>bet din</italic> will seize his property in order to provide for such needs rather than allow him to become a public charge. In satisfying basic needs there is no upper limit in the sense of a percentage of net worth.</p>
<p>There is certainly no limit upon the amount of money a person can be compelled to spend for basic necessities such as food, clothing, shelter or even medical expenses. But is there no limit to the sum that a person may be required to expend in order to preserve personal dignity? For example, when no other clothes are available, must a person expend &#x0024;25,000,000 in the purchase of clothing in order to avoid appearing naked in public? Assuming that he may forego his own personal dignity, may he be compelled to expend that sum to clothe his wife whose necessities he is halakhically obligated to provide? Assuredly, a person has the right to spend &#x0024;25,000,000 of his own funds to purchase a suit of clothes if he so desires, particularly if otherwise he would remain naked. But suppose the deceased left specific instructions declining such exorbitant burial expenses and the heirs, at least under such circumstances, are unconcerned with considerations of family honor, may society demand an expenditure of that magnitude in order to preserve the dignity of the human race? Such a requirement may well require expenditure of a sum even greater than the maximum financial burden that must be assumed in order to fulfill a <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> but it does not appear to be open-ended. Rather, it would seem that the obligation is limited to the amount that normal, rational persons of comparable social station would expend for that purpose.</p>
<p>To be sure, there is no ceiling upon the amount a person may choose to spend for clothing to avoid public exposure in a naked state and, similarly, there is no upper limit to the portion of his estate that a person may designate to defray the avoidance of his body being left uninterred. In order to achieve that end a person may well desire to expend an amount far greater than that to which he has bound himself by virtue of entry into a social compact. Nevertheless, in the absence of indication to the contrary, the presumption would be that the deceased&#x2019;s needs, desires and wishes parallel those of other persons similarly situated.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is a halakhic basis for assuming that the deceased would not have wished to deprive his children by allowing an inordinate portion of his estate to be appropriated for use in sparing his corpse dishonor. Mutilation of a corpse is forbidden because it constitutes defilement of the corpse, or <italic>nivul ha-met</italic>, and as such is antithetical to the honor and dignity due to human remains. The prohibition against violation of a corpse is suspended, as are virtually all halakhic restrictions, for purposes of rescuing a human life. A number of authorities find independent reason to permit an autopsy in order to prevent or cure a hereditary disease.<sup><xref rid="fn584">22</xref></sup> Their reasoning is based upon the consideration that a person is willing to forego at least a measure of honor and dignity for the benefit of his progeny. The consideration is reflected in the ruling recorded in <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> 356:1 providing that funds collected for burial expenses in excess of actual disbursements for that purpose should be given to the heirs of the deceased. As explained by both <italic>Shakh</italic> and <italic>Taz</italic>, <italic>ad locum</italic>, on the basis of the reasoning advanced by the Gemara, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 48a, the recipient of charitable funds is embarrassed thereby but the deceased is willing to accept such embarrassment for the benefit of his heirs. Rashi, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 48a, s.v. <italic>tanna kamma</italic>, comments that the deceased &#x201C;while yet alive, forgave his ignominy and is content that he be dishonored after death for the benefit of the heirs.&#x201D; Although Rashi&#x2019;s comment is somewhat ambiguous, it may readily be understood as connoting constructive rather than actual forgiveness. Similarly, the Gemara, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 46b, states that Sarah was glad to accept a measure of dishonor involved in delaying her burial until Abraham&#x2019;s arrival &#x201C;so that Abraham would be honored through her.&#x201D; Assuredly, the degree of embarrassment or dishonor suffered by the deceased cannot be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the heirs. Indeed, in each of the instances cited the embarrassment to the deceased is relatively minor. Nevertheless, it may certainly be argued that, although burial is a human need to be defrayed from a person&#x2019;s own funds, the deceased would not have required that his heirs succumb to extortionate demands in order to effect his burial.</p>
<p>The notion that there is a limit to the amount that a person can be compelled to spend in order to defray his own burial expenses is cogent if interment is rooted in the concept of <italic>bizyona</italic>. If, however, the rationale is <italic>kapparah</italic>, atonement or expiation of sin, it may certainly be argued that expiation of sin constitutes a basic human need akin to sustenance and shelter. If so, there may well be no limit to the costs that might be levied upon the deceased himself for that purpose just as there is no limit upon the value of a person&#x2019;s resources that may be seized in order to meet the expenses involved in satisfying that person&#x2019;s needs. However, the consideration of <italic>kapparah</italic> does not appear to give rise to an obligation upon the deceased during his lifetime and hence does not serve to explain how a lien against the estate might arise. If the heirs are indeed under personal obligation to fulfill the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> of burial, the extent of that obligation should be similar to the extent of financial expenditure required for fulfilling similar commandments as has been discussed earlier.</p>
<h1>VIII. <italic>&#x201C;Ransom&#x201D; of a Corpse</italic></h1>
<p>There is, however, one further consideration that would serve to mitigate that obligation. <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 252:4, records the rabbinic enactment that forbids ransoming of captives for a sum &#x201C;greater than their worth&#x201D; which is generally defined as the price a person would command in a slave market.<sup><xref rid="fn585">23</xref></sup> That edict was promulgated in order to discourage captors or kidnappers from making extravagant demands. The effect of the ordinance was to put them on notice that only &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D; demands would be met. The ordinance effects only communal responsibility with regard to ransoming captives. A person may pay as high a ransom as he wishes provided that he uses his own funds.</p>
<p>The demand of the non-Jewish son for &#x0024;25,000,000 in order to release his father&#x2019;s body for burial is halakhically naught but a demand for &#x201C;ransom&#x201D; of the corpse. The demand is extortionate and the sum outrageous or, in halakhic terms, it is far in excess of the &#x201C;value&#x201D; of the corpse.</p>
<p>It is certainly arguable that the ordinance promulgated with regard to ransoming a captive applies to ransoming a corpse as well. Otherwise, the purpose of the edict, i.e., to discourage future acts of kidnapping or prevention of the impoverishment of the community, would be defeated: the captors would merely have to hold the prisoners until their death and then demand the same sum in return for relinquishing the body. If so, the community has no obligation to submit to extortion in order to provide proper burial.</p>
<p>It is indeed the case that, as recorded by <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh, Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 252:4, a person may, at his discretion, provide funds for purposes of his own ransom without any limitation. Accordingly, while yet alive, an individual may well direct that his funds, and hence the funds available in his estate, be used for assuring proper burial by &#x201C;ransoming&#x201D; his corpse, but he is under no obligation to do so. In the absence of an earlier clearly expressed desire on the part of the deceased it would seem that the rabbinic ordinance should govern. Hence, the fact that the estate is charged with defrayment of expenses associated with interment of the decedent&#x2019;s remains does not demand acquiescence to an extortionate demand.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the question of extortionate, or even extraordinary, expenditure for purposes of assuring proper burial has not been addressed in the responsa literature of previous generations. In the case under discussion, whether or not he was actually obligated to do so, the conduct of the son who was unhesitant in surrendering the inheritance of a fortune in order to accord his father a proper Jewish burial commands approbation and respect.</p>
<ftnote id="fn563">1. The account in <italic>Mishpacha</italic> appears in greater and more heart-rending detail. According to that version the non-Jewish brother residing somewhere in South America, where the father had made his home after the war, arranged for a church funeral to be followed by cremation. See also <italic>Toratekha Sha&#x2019;ashu&#x2019;ai</italic> (Jerusalem, 5768), pp. 189-193 and <italic>Ve-Ha&#x2019;arev Na</italic>, II, 70-72.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn564">2. <italic>Mishpacha</italic> reports that the initial offer of the Jewish son was in the sum of &#x0024;10,000,000.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn565">3. The Gemara, <italic>Bava Batra</italic> 112a, declares that it is an indignity for a person to be buried in a grave that he does not own. The obvious problem is that, since property cannot be vested in a corpse, immediately upon a person&#x2019;s death the grave becomes the possession of his heirs and hence is no longer his. R. Meshullam Roth, <italic>Teshuvot Kol Mevaser</italic>, I, no. 56, asserts that neither a grave nor funds needed for burial expenses pass to the heirs but remain vested in the deceased. <italic>Kol Mevaser</italic> takes the notion that a corpse can be seized of property required for burial a step further in declaring that a grave provided by others on behalf of a person who dies without funds also becomes the property of the deceased. R. Elchanan Wasserman, <italic>Kove&#x1E93; Shi&#x2019;urim, Ketubot</italic>, sec. 314, ascribes a similar position to Rashba, cited by <italic>Shitah Mekubbe&#x1E93;et, Bava Batra</italic> 8b, with regard to all funds collected for the burial of the deceased. <italic>Kove&#x1E93; Shi&#x2019;urim</italic> suggests that vesting of title in the deceased may be a rabbinic enactment.</ftnote>
<ftnote>However, Ramah, <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 48a, states explicitly that title to such funds does not vest in the deceased. That position is also atttributed to <italic>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</italic>, I, no. 375, by <italic>Ma&#x1E25;aneh Efrayim, Hilkhot Zekhiyah u-Matanah</italic>, no. 31. That is also the view of <italic>&#x1E24;azon Ish, Likkutim</italic>, no. 20 and <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 48:1. Cf., <italic>Shurat ha-Din</italic>, XI (Jerusalem, 5767), 92-95.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn566">4. The comment of <italic>Ba&#x1E25;</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 275:4, to the effect that chattel of a proselyte located within four cubits of his corpse become the property of the deceased for purposes of burial is not to be construed literally as evidenced by <italic>Ba&#x1E25;&#x2019;s</italic> supporting comment citing the statement of the Gemara, <italic>Berakhot</italic> 18a, declaring that &#x201C;A corpse is seized of four cubits for purposes of [causing others to be prohibited from] reciting <italic>Shema</italic>.&#x201D; That dictum certainly does not reflect the existence of a property interest vested in the corpse. See <italic>infra</italic>, note 10 and accompanying text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn567">5. Cf., however, <italic>Yad Ramah, Sanhedrin</italic> 46b, who understands the Gemara as stating only that there is no <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> requiring that the deceased be provided with undesired atonement but not that burial would be of no purpose in that regard.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn568">6. See <italic>Kitvei Ramban</italic>, ed. R. Bernard Chavel (Jerusalem, 5724), II, 118.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn569">7. Citing Ramban, <italic>Kesef Mishneh, ad locum</italic>, explains that the question of whether burial is required by virtue of <italic>bizyona</italic> or for the purpose of <italic>kapparah</italic> is left unresolved by the Gemara. Accordingly, opines <italic>Kesef Mishneh</italic>, Rambam rules that burial is required by reason of doubt even if the deceased had directed otherwise. <italic>Teshuvot Maharam Min&#x1E93;</italic>, no. 45, states that the Gemara indeed accepts <italic>bizyona</italic> as the rationale for burial but further states that the two rationales are complementary rather than exclusive and hence both must be regarded as normative.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn570">8. The conclusion that heirs may be compelled to defray burial expenses on the basis of this consideration rests upon acceptance of the talmudic opinion that burial is necessary because of <italic>bizyona</italic>. Accordingly, that conclusion is valid only if Rambam and <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an Arukh</italic> are understood as ruling definitively that burial is required by reason of <italic>bizyona</italic> either because the talmudic opinion that burial is required because of <italic>kapparah</italic> is rejected or because the two explanations are complementary. See <italic>supra</italic>, note 7. If, however, the issue of <italic>bizyona</italic> versus <italic>kapparah</italic> remains a matter of doubt, as Ramban in his earlier-cited comments maintains, and funeral expenses represent a lien against property to which heirs have succeeded, the heirs should logically be considered to be <italic>mu&#x1E25;zakim</italic>, i.e., in possession of the property. If so, those seeking to compel the heirs to pay for the burial bear the burden of proof, a burden which, if the halakhic issue is unresolved, can never be satisfied. Ramban, however, declares that the heirs are compelled to bear the costs &#x201C;because of doubt,&#x201D; i.e., because stringency is mandated in instances of doubt with regard to fulfillment of a religious obligation. It seems to this writer that Ramban in that comment adopts the view that heirs have a personal religious obligation to bury their deceased relatives and is in agreement with the authorities cited in the following section who espouse that view. See also <italic>Teshuvot Radvaz</italic>, II, no. 780.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn571">9. This analysis serves to dispel the criticism of <italic>Ba&#x1E25;</italic> expressed by <italic>Shakh</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 275:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn572">10. <italic>Perishah</italic> establishes that point by pointing to a discrepancy between the rule applied in the case of a person who seizes the property of a deceased proselyte and the rule applied to the beneficiary of a gift <italic>mortis causa</italic>, i.e., a <italic>mattnat shekhiv me-ra</italic>. The latter is liable for burial expenses whereas the former has no such liability. <italic>Perishah</italic> explains that rabbinic decree established <italic>mattnat shekhiv me-ra</italic> as a conveyance comparable to inheritance, i.e., in both cases title vests after death and hence is subject to a lien with regard to burial expenses, whereas the property of a proselyte becomes <italic>res nullius</italic> before his death by virtue of rabbinic decree and thus is not subject to a similar lien.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn573">11. For a parallel analysis of the inception of a lien in favor of a wife for support and maintenance as a widow see <italic>Sema</italic>, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 242:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn574">12. See also R. Chaim Halberstam, <italic>Teshuvot Divrei &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, I, no. 64.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn575">13. Rambam, <italic>Hilkhot Avel</italic> 2:6, disagrees with that position but only on the grounds that the <italic>mi&#x1E93;vah</italic> requiring defilement is addressed only to those who are otherwise forbidden to defile themselves. The daughter of a <italic>kohen</italic> is not bound by the strictures regarding defilement addressed to <italic>kohanim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn576">14. Rema, <italic>&#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 107:2, rules that in some circumstances a creditor may prevent burial of the deceased until the debt is satisfied by the estate. Rema further rules that if the creditor is a relative of the deceased he may not cause the corpse to be disgraced by forcing burial to be delayed. <italic>Bi&#x2019;ur ha-Gra, &#x1E24;oshen Mishpat</italic> 107:14, cogently comments that the Rema&#x2019;s latter ruling is predicated upon <italic>Tosafot&#x2019;s</italic> second explanation. If so, Rema must be regarded as ruling that heirs have a personal financial obligation with regard to the burial of the deceased. See also the analysis of Ramban, cited <italic>supra</italic>, note 8. It should be noted that <italic>Kesef Mishneh, Hilkhot Avel</italic> 12:1, apparently ascribes Ramban&#x2019;s position to Rambam as well. Thus, <italic>Shakh</italic> appears to be the only authority who explicitly rejects the notion that relatives have a personal financial obligation to assure burial of the deceased.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Note should be made of a perplexity inherent in Rema&#x2019;s ruling. A creditor not related to the deceased may prevent burial in order to effect payment of the debt owed him. A creditor who is also a relative may not make a similar demand because he is bound by the commandment that forbids allowing the corpse to remain unburied even though avoidance of the transgression will entail an expense to him. If relatives are bound by that commandment and are required to expend funds in order to avoid transgression, why, then, are they not required to satisfy the deceased&#x2019;s debt in order to fulfill their obligation to assure prompt burial? If they are not required to satisfy a just debt, <italic>a fortiori</italic>, they cannot be required to submit to extortion, as in the situation under discussion.</ftnote>
<ftnote><italic>Teshuvot &#x1E24;avvot Ya&#x2019;ir</italic>, no. 139, understands Rema in precisely that way and states, without explanation, that in such circumstances there is no transgression. <italic>Pit&#x1E25;ei Teshuvah</italic>, <italic>Yoreh De&#x2019;ah</italic> 347:1, expresses puzzlement at that understanding of Rema. <italic>Pit&#x1E25;ei Teshuvah</italic> asserts that Rema&#x2019;s comments should be construed only as acknowledging the creditor&#x2019;s right to cause burial to be delayed without transgression on the part of the creditor but that the relatives who do not satisfy the creditor&#x2019;s demands are in violation of the prohibition against delaying burial. Rema&#x2019;s comments are indeed directed only to a lack of culpability on the part of the creditor; Rema is entirely silent with regard to the responsibility or absence thereof on the part of the relatives of the deceased.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn577">15. Cf., <italic>Magen Avraham</italic>, <italic>Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> 656:7, who cites the variant opinion of Rabbenu Yeru&#x1E25;am who maintains that a person should not expend more than one-fifth of his fortune for this purpose but that the obligatory expenditure is limited to ten percent.
