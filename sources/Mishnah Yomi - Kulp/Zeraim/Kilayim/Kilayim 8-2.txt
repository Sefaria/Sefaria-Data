Kilayim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah teaches that it is forbidden to yoke together all potential combinations of two different species of animal and plow with them or even pull them or lead them while yoked together.

Mishnah Two
A beast (behemah) with a beast [of another species]; a wild animal (hayyah) with a wild animal [of another species]; a behemah with a hayyah; a hayyah with a behemah; an unclean beast with an unclean beast [of another species]; a clean beast with a clean beast [of another species]; or an unclean beast with a clean beast; or a clean beast with an unclean beast; they are forbidden for plowing, and [it is forbidden] to pull them or lead them [tied together].  

Explanation
A behemah is a domesticated animal such as an ox. A hayyah is a wild animal such as a deer. In this exhaustive mishnah we learn that all potential combinations are prohibited, even though it is unlikely that some of these animals would ever be yoked at all.
