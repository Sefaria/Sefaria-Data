Kilayim, Chapter One, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah continues listing pairs of seeds that do not constitute kilayim one with the other. While this admittedly may not be the most exciting topic of study, we should recognize how important these laws would have been to the farmers observing them.  A farmer simply had to know what could and what could not be grown together. Growing the wrong things together may have made his produce forbidden to eat, causing him great financial loss. We should also note that by allowing similar seeds to grow together, the laws were much easier than the might have otherwise have been interpreted.
Again, there is not much to explain on this mishnah so I have refrained from commenting.

Mishnah Two
Cucumbers and melons do not constitute kilayim one with the other. 
	Rabbi Judah said they do constitute kilayim. 
Lettuce and wild  lettuce, endives and wild endives, leek and wild leek, coriander and wild  coriander, or mustard and Egyptian mustard, Egyptian gourd and the bitter gourd,  or Egyptian beans and carob shaped beans do not constitute kilayim one with the other.
