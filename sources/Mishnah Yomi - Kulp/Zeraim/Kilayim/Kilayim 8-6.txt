Kilayim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah classifies various animals into “behemah”—domesticated beast or “hayyah”—wild animal.

Mishnah Six
The wild ox—[it is in the category of] behemah.
But Rabbi Yose says: [it is in the category] of hayyah.   
The dog —[it is in the category of] hayyah.
But Rabbi Yose says: [it is in the category] of behemah.   
The pig —[it is in the category of] behemah. 
The wild donkey—[it is in the category of] hayyah.   
The elephant and the monkey—[they are in the category of] hayyah.   
A human being is permitted to draw, plow, or lead with any of them. 

Explanation
Section one: The wild ox is considered a behemah. This means that one can yoke it together with a domesticated ox.  Rabbi Yose disagrees and holds that it is in the category of hayyah, and therefore cannot be yoked together with its domesticated cousin.
Section two:  A dog, according to the first opinion, is a hayyah, whereas Rabbi Yose considers it to be a behemah.  (It does seem that there are some dogs which are more “domesticated” than others—ours was much more on the hayyah side, despite our best efforts to make it into a behemah).  We should note that even if a dog is domesticated it couldn’t be yoked together with another species. This causes us to ask why the mishnah bothers classifying this and the other animals that appear in the next three sections. According to the Tosefta, the reason for this classification is that if a person sells all of his “behemot” or all of his “hayyot” we need to know which animals he has sold.  It also seems to me that just as zoologists like categorizing animals and botanists like categorizing plants, rabbis liked categorizing as well.
Section six: A human being cannot be considered “kilayim” with any animal.  This means that a human being can draw a wagon, or plow with any animal.  The words “or lead” are probably a mistake and shouldn’t be here because animals don’t generally lead other animals.
