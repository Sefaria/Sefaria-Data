Kilayim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four 
Shrouds for the dead, and the packsaddle of a donkey are not subject to the law of kilayim.   
One may not [however] place a packsaddle [made of kilayim] on one’s shoulder even for the purpose of carrying dung out on it.

Explanation
Section one:  Shrouds for a dead person can be made out of kilayim, because a dead person does not have to observe the laws of the Torah.  
A packsaddle is made to sit on and not to put it on oneself. Leviticus 19:19 says that one should not “put upon oneself kilayim” and therefore the packsaddle is not subject to the laws of kilayim.
Section two:  However, since the Torah states that the prohibition is to “put upon oneself,” putting the packsaddle on one’s shoulder is prohibited, even though this would not normally be considered “wearing.”  We see here that the rabbis seem to be mediating between Deuteronomy states, “Do not wear” and Leviticus which states “Do not put upon oneself.”
