Kilayim, Chapter Two, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with a situation in which a person has planted his field with one type of seed and then changes his mind and wishes to plant it with another.

Mishnah Four
[His field was] sown [with grain, or pulse, or garden-seed], and he changed his mind and decided to plant it [with vines], he may not say: “First I shall plant [the vines] and then turn [the soil],” but he must [first] turn [the soil] and then he may plant [the vines].
[If it was] ‘planted’ [with vines] and he changed his mind and decided to seed [with grain, pulse or garden-seed], he may not say: “First I shall sow [the grain etc.] and then I uproot [the vines],” but he must [first] uproot [the vines] and then he may sow [the grain etc.]
If he wants, he may cut down [the vines] to less than a handbreadth [above ground], and then he may sow [the grain] and later, he uproots [the vines].

Explanation
Sections one and two:  These two sections are both basically the same as the last section of yesterday’s mishnah. What he must do is first get rid of that which he had already planted—if he planted seeds he must turn the soil and if he planted grape vines he must uproot them—and then he can plant the new vines or sow the new seed.
Section three:  If he doesn’t want to totally uproot the vines before he sows the seed he may cut the vine shoots down to less than a handbreadth’s height, sow the seed and then uproot at a later date. When the shoots are less than a handbreadth tall they are considered as if they are not really vine shoots.
