Kilayim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah is a continuation of yesterday’s mishnah.

Mishnah Five 
Rabbi Yose said: It happened that a man sowed [seed in] his vineyard in the sabbatical year,   and the matter came before Rabbi Akiva, who said: a person does not prohibit [as kilayim] that which is not his own.  

Explanation
During the sabbatical year produce grown in one’s field is considered ownerless—anyone who wants can come and take it, although he is not allowed to sell it. Therefore, Rabbi Akiva takes the rule that we learned in yesterday’s mishnah, “a person does not prohibit [as kilayim] that which is not his own” and applies it to the case that comes before him, of one who sowed his own vineyard with seed during the sabbatical year.  Rabbi Akiva rules that the seeds are not prohibited as kilayim.
