Kilayim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Three

Introduction
The next five mishnayot begin to catalogue what items made of cloth are subject to the kilayim prohibition. The basic rule is that anything used to cover a person’s body, even temporarily, may be subject to the laws of kilayim. The reason is that the Torah phrases the prohibition as “One may not wear shatnez” (Deuteronomy 22:11). From here the rabbis derive that only “wearing” or anything close to wearing is prohibited.    

Mishnah Three
Hand towels, scroll covers, and bath towels do not come under the prohibition of kilayim.   Rabbi Eliezer prohibits.   
Barbers’ covers are subject to the prohibition of kilayim.  

Explanation
Section one: All of these items are not used to cover a person’s body.  They are not “worn.” Therefore they are not subject to the laws of kilayim.  
Section two:  The cloths that the barber puts on the person getting his/her hair cut are in actuality temporary clothing. Since they are in a sense clothing, they are subject to the laws of kilayim.
