Kilayim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah deals with seeds of grain that were sown in a flowerpot and then brought in to a vineyard.  This creates a situation of kilayim depending on whether the flowerpot is perforated.  If it is perforated, then that which grows in the pot is treated as if it is grown in the ground.  If it is not perforated, then it is not considered as if it is grown in the ground.

Mishnah Eight
[Seed sown in a] perforated flowerpot, prohibits [as kilayim] in a vineyard.  
[In] one not perforated, does not prohibit [as kilayim].   
Rabbi Shimon says: both are forbidden but neither prohibits. 
One who carries a perforated flowerpot through a vineyard, if [that which is sown in it] grows a two-hundredth part, it is forbidden. 

Explanation
Section one: A flowerpot that is perforated is treated like the earth.  If one plants seeds in such a pot and then puts the pot in a vineyard the seeds and grapes are kilayim and are prohibited.
Section two:  However, if the pot is not perforated, then nothing is prohibited as kilayim.
Section three:  According to Rabbi Shimon, while it is forbidden to bring either type of pot with seeds into the vineyard, neither of them becomes kilayim. Rabbi Shimon disagrees specifically with the opinion in section one.  He holds that even perforated flowerpots are not treated like the ground.  
Section four: This section discusses a person who carries a perforated flowerpot through a vineyard, and doesnâ€™t put it on the ground, as was the situation in section one.  The mishnah rules that if the seeds that are in the pot grow 1/200 of their size while being carried through the vineyard, they are forbidden to eat.  However, they are not strictly kilayim, nor do they cause the grapes to be kilayim either.
