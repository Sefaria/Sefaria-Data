Berakhot, Chapter Two, Mishnah Three

Introduction 
Our mishnah deals with the question of what does it mean to actually “recite” the Shema.

Mishnah Three
One who recites the Shema without causing it to be heard by his own ear, he has fulfilled his obligation. 
Rabbi Yose says: he has not fulfilled his obligation. 
If he recited it without pronouncing the letters succinctly, Rabbi Yose says he has fulfilled his obligation. 
Rabbi Judah says: he has not fulfilled his obligation. 
If he recites it out of order, he has not fulfilled his obligation. 
If he recites it and makes a mistake he goes back to the place where he made the mistake.

Explanation
Section one:  According to the first opinion, one who whispers the Shema so faintly that he himself cannot hear what he said has nevertheless fulfilled his obligation.  Rabbi Yose says that he has not. The Talmud interprets Rabbi Yose as deriving his halakhah from the word “Shema (listen)”—the word implies that one must hear the words of the Shema being recited.
Section two:  This refers to someone who recites the Shema quickly, blurring one word into another.  For instance he runs the word “bekhol” into the next word “levavekha”.  Rabbi Yose holds that he has fulfilled his obligation whereas Rabbi Judah holds that he has not.
Section three:  If he recites the verses within a paragraph out of order, he has not fulfilled his obligation.  However, the halakhah is that if he recited the paragraphs out of order he has fulfilled his obligation.
Section four: If while reciting the Shema he realized that he made a mistake, what he must do is go back to the beginning of the verse in which he made the mistake.
