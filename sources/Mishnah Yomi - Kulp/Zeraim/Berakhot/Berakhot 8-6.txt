Berakhot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah teaches some laws concerning the candles and spices.

Mishnah Six
They do not bless over the candles or the spices of non-Jews;
Or over the candles or the spices of the dead;   
Or over the candles or the spices of idolatry;
And a blessing is not said over the light until they benefit from its light.

Explanation
Section one:  A Jew cannot use a candle that was lit on Shabbat by a non-Jew because the candle has to cease being used during the Shabbat for it to be used at Havdalah.  It too has to have a Shabbat.  
He canâ€™t use the spices of non-Jews because we fear that they may have been used for idolatry.
Section two:  This section refers to candles that were lit to honor the dead or spices that were used to mask the odor of a dead body. Since these were intended to be used for the dead, they cannot be used for Havdalah.
Section three:  It is forbidden to derive benefit from anything used for idolatry and hence it is forbidden to use the candle for light or the spices for smell.  
Section four:  It is not enough to light the candle, one must actually use it as well.  This is why people put their hands up to the candle today when doing Havdalah.
