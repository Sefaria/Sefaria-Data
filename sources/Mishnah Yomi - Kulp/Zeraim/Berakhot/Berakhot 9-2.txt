Berakhot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah continues to list various blessings recited upon seeing or hearing things.

Mishnah Two
[On witnessing] comets, earthquakes, thunder, or windy storms one says, “Blessed be He whose strength and might fill the world.” 
[On seeing] mountains, hills, seas, rivers or deserts one says, “Blessed be He who made creation.”  
Rabbi Judah says: one who sees the Great Sea should say, “Blessed be He who made the Great Sea,” if he sees it at intervals. 
For rain and for good news one says, “Blessed be He that is good and grants good.” 
For bad news one says, “Blessed be the true judge.”

Explanation
Section one:  These are phenomena that “fill the world” for people see them at many places at the same time.
Section two: These are geological structures that were a part of God’s original creation.  
Section three:  This is the second time that we have seen Rabbi Judah rule that blessings have to be specific to the situation. The first was in 6:1.  Here too he distinguishes between the “Great Sea,” which is the Mediterranean and other seas.  Over the former he recites a specific blessing, whereas over other seas in rivers he recites a more generalized blessing.  However, he only recites this special blessing if he sees the Great Sea periodically, which the Talmud explains as being once in thirty days. One who sees the Great Sea every day does not bless every day.
Section four:  Some commentators say that one blesses over rain only if it hasn’t rained for a long time.  However, others say that in Israel, a very dry country, people are so happy when it rains for the first time that they also recites the blessing the first time it rains in the rainy season.  
Section five: Today this is the blessing that a person recites upon hearing that someone has died.
