Berakhot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah One

Introduction
The final chapter of Berakhot deals with various blessings recited upon different occasions, such as seeing certain things or when certain unusual events happen.

Mishnah One
If one sees a place where miracles have been done for Israel, he says, “Blessed be the One who made miracles for our ancestors in this place.” 
[If one sees] a place from which idolatry has been uprooted, he should say, “Blessed be the One who removed idolatry from our land.”

Explanation
Section one:  If one sees a place where miracles happened to Israel, for instance the Sea of Reeds, or the place where the Israelites crossed the Jordan (see Joshua 3:17) a blessing should be recited.
Section two:  This blessing refers to idolatry which was uprooted from the land of Israel.  According to the Talmud, if one sees a place outside of the land of Israel from which idolatry has been uprooted one should say, “Blessed be the One who removed idolatry from this place.”  To both blessings one should add, “Just as it has been removed from this place, so may it be removed from all other places and may God turn the hearts of idolaters to Your worship.”
