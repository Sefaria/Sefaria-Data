Berakhot, Chapter Four, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
The final mishnah of the chapter deals with the musaf prayer, the additional prayer recited on Shabbat, festivals and Rosh Hodesh. This prayer corresponds to the musaf sacrifices offered in the Temple on the aforementioned days.

Mishnah Seven
Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah says: The musaf prayer is said only with the local congregation.   
The sages say: whether with or with out the congregation. 
Rabbi Judah said in his name: wherever there is a congregation, an individual is exempt from saying the musaf prayer. 

Explanation
Section one: According to Rabbi Elzazar ben Azaryah the musaf prayer is not an individual prayer but rather a communal one.  It is only said with the local congregation.  It seems that according to Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah the musaf retains a connection to its Temple roots.  While the other regular prayers are only loosely connected to the Temple, the musaf prayer is strongly connected. Since the Temple was a public offering, the musaf prayer does not become an individual prayer.
Section two:  The other rabbis do not make any distinction between the various recitations of the Tefillah.  All are equally obligatory upon the individual regardless of whether the community is reciting them.  
Section three:  Rabbi Judah somewhat modifies Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah’s position.  Individuals are obligated to recite the musaf tefillah, but only if there is no congregation in his community to recite the prayer.  If the community is reciting the prayer and he can’t be there for some reason, then he is exempt.
