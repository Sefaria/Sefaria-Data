Berakhot, Chapter Two, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This is the final case in which Rabban Gamaliel seems to behave not according to halakhic norms.  

Mishnah Seven
When Tabi his [Rabban Gamalielâ€™s] slave died he accepted condolences for him. His disciples said to him: Master, have you not taught us that one does not accept condolences for slaves? He replied to them: My slave Tabi was not like other slaves: he was a fit man.

Explanation
Normally, one does not accord to slaves the same mourning practices that one does for a free person.  The community does not come to offer condolences to the master nor does the master open his house to people coming to console him.  However, Tabi was a special slave, one who kept all of the mitzvoth to which he was subject (see Sukkah 2:1, where Tabi sleeps under a bed inside a sukkah).  Hence, Rabban Gamaliel again broke the normal halakhah and accepted formal condolences upon the loss of this special slave.
