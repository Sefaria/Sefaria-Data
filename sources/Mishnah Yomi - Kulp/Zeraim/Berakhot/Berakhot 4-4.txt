Berakhot, Chapter Four, Mishnah Four

Introduction
The first section of today’s mishnah continues the debate over the daily recitation of the Shmoneh Esrei.  
The second section deals with someone who cannot pray the full Shmoneh Esrei because he is in a dangerous place.  

Mishnah Four
Rabbi Eliezer says: if a man makes his prayers fixed, it is not [true] supplication. 
Rabbi Joshua says: if one is traveling in a dangerous place, he says a short prayer, saying: Save, O Lord, Your people the remnant of Israel.  In every time of crisis may their needs be before You. Blessed are You, O Lord, who hears prayer.

Explanation
Section one:  Rabbi Eliezer objects to the entire institution of fixed prayer.  One who is given a fixed liturgy is not engaged in true supplication.  The only reason he is saying the prayer is that he is obligated to do so. This is always a present and potent danger when it comes to fixed prayer.  It seems that Rabbi Eliezer is espousing a traditional position. Traditionally prayer had been spontaneous, as we can see from the biblical record.  Rabbi Eliezer objected to Rabban Gamaliel’s innovation that every person would have to say a set formula three times a day.  
While Rabbi Eliezer lost out and the halakhah was established that one is obligated to recite a fixed formula, we would do well to heed his warning and remember that while reciting prayer, it is preferable to prevent it from becoming too fixed, as if one is reading a letter. This is in my opinion one of the greatest challenges when it comes to Jewish prayer.  
Section two:  When someone is traveling in a dangerous place and cannot either concentrate or stay still long enough to recite the Shmoneh Esrei, he should recite this short prayer which basically asks God to provide one’s needs to make it through the current crisis.
