Berakhot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Six

Introduction
In ancient Greco-Roman custom, formal meals were eaten while reclining on couches. Indeed, a banquet was to a certain extent defined by reclining.  Today, the only time Jews recline, even symbolically, is at the Pesah seder.  In contrast, people sitting upright and eating together were not at a banquet, rather they were just putting food in their mouths so that they wouldn’t be hungry.

Mishnah Six
If [those at the table] are sitting upright, each one blesses for himself. 
If they are reclining, one blesses for them all.  
If wine came during the meal, each one says a blessing for himself.
If after the meal, one blesses for them all. 
The same one says [the blessing] over the incense, even though the incense is not brought until after the meal. 

Explanation
Section one:  People sitting and eating together are not really eating a meal together.  Hence, when the food arrives everyone blesses for himself.
Section two:  If they are reclining, then they are eating a formal banquet together and one person can bless on behalf of them all.
Section three:  As I stated in yesterday’s mishnah, wine was generally not served during the middle of the meal. When it was, it wasn’t social wine but rather wine to help one digest one’s food.  Also, it would be drunk at different times and not everyone would drink together. Therefore, each person blesses for himself.  If the wine came at the end of the meal then everyone would drink together and one person could bless for them all.
Section four:  At the end of a formal meal incense would be brought in front of the diners.  The person who blesses over the wine at the end of the meal also recites the blessing over the incense “Who creates the wood of incense” (Bore atzei besamim).
