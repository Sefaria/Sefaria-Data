Berakhot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Five

Introduction
The final mishnah of this chapter deals with two groups eating in the same room and whether or not they say a zimun together.

Mishnah Five
Two eating companies that were eating in the same room:
When some of them can see some of the other they combine [for a zimun], but if not each group makes a zimun for itself. 
They do not bless over the wine until they put water into it, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. 
The sages say they bless.

Explanation
Section one:  The rule here is quite simple—if the two groups can see each other then they are “eating together” and they should do one zimun. Not everyone from every group has to see each the other group, rather it is sufficient that some from each group can see the other group.  If no one sees each the other group, then they each do a zimun for themselves.  
Section two:  Wine was generally mixed with water before it was drunk.  This would lower the alcohol level of the wine to around 5 %, a level similar to the beer that we generally drink.  [Today wine is usually about 12% alcohol.] According to Rabbi Eliezer if one drinks unmixed wine a blessing is not recited because civilized people don’t drink unmixed wine.  The other sages disagree and hold that he does recite the blessing over even unmixed wine.
