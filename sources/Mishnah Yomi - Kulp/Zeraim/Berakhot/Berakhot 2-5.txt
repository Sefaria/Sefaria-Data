Berakhot, Chapter Two, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a bridegroom reciting the Shema. The problem is that he may not be able to have the proper intention because he is focusing on other matters.

Mishnah Five
A bridegroom is exempt from reciting the Shema on the first night until the end of the Shabbat, if he has not performed the act.  
It happened with Rabban Gamaliel who recited the Shema on the first night after he had married.  His students said to him: Our master, have you not taught us that a bridegroom is exempt from reciting the Shema. He replied to them: I will not listen to you to remove from myself the Kingship of Heaven even for a moment.

Explanation
Section one:  According to the first mishnah in Ketubot, virgins are married on Wednesdays.  Our mishnah teaches that the bridegroom is exempt from his obligation to recite the Shema from the first night of his wedding and for the next four nights, if he had not yet had sexual relations with her.  Until he has relations with her he will obviously be very nervous, especially since this may very well be his first sexual encounter.  This nervousness will prevent him from having the proper intention and hence the mishnah exempts him.  However, if he hasn’t had sex with her until after Shabbat, he must go back to reciting the Shema.
Section two: The story of Rabban Gamaliel seems to show that the previous clause means that the bridegroom is exempt from the Shema, not that he can’t recite it should he want to do so. Rabban Gamaliel’s love of God, his desire to say the Shema and thereby accept upon himself the Kingship of Heaven is so strong, that he cannot desist from reciting the Shema even on his wedding night.  [We don’t know how his bride reacted to this.]
