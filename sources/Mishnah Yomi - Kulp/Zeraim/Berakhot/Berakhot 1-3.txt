Berakhot, Chapter One Mishnah Three

Introduction
 The Torah says that one should recite the Shema “when you lie down and when you get up.”  In our mishnah, Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel debate the meaning of this phrase.
 
Mishnah Three
Bet Shammai say: in the evening every man should recline and recite [the Shema], and in the morning he should stand, as it says, “And when you lie down and when you get up” (Deuteronomy 6:7).   
Bet Hillel say that every man should recite in his own way, as it says, “And when you walk by the way” (ibid).  Why then is it said, “And when you lies down and when you get up?” At the time when people lie down and at the time when people rise up. 
Rabbi Tarfon said: I was once walking by the way and I reclined to recite the Shema according to the words of Bet Shammai, and I incurred danger from robbers. 
They said to him: you deserved to come to harm, because you acted against the words of Bet Hillel.

Explanation
Section one:  Bet Shammai reads the verse quite literally.  In the evening one must lie down and recite the Shema and in the morning one must stand up and recite it.  
Section two:  In contrast, to Bet Hillel these words refer to the time when people lie down and the time when they rise up.  The words “and when you walk by the way” prove that the Torah does not really care what position a person is when he recites the Shema.
Section three: Rabbi Tarfon, a sage who lived after the destruction of the Temple, testifies that one time while going on the way in the evening (probably riding on his donkey), he went out of his way to lie down on the ground and he almost incurred danger from robbers. The rabbis to whom he is talking tell him that he deserved whatever trouble he got in for going out of his way to act like Bet Shammai. The halakhah is like Bet Hillel and a rabbi who acts against this halakhah is endangering his own life.
