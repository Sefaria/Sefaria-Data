Berakhot, Chapter Four, Mishnah Two

Introduction 
In today’s mishnah we learn that Rabbi Nehuniah ben Hakaneh had a special prayer that he would say when he went in and out of the Bet Hamidrash (the rabbinic study hall).  

Mishnah Two
Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakaneh used to pray as he entered the Bet Hamidrash and as he left it a short prayer. 
They said to him: what is the reason for this prayer? 
He replied: When I enter I pray that that no mishap should occur through me, and when I leave I express thanks for my portion.

Explanation
The Babylonian Talmud (Berakhot 28b) gives a fuller reading of this blessing. It reads:
“Our Rabbis taught: On entering what does one say? “May it be Your will, O Lord my God, that no mishap should occur through me, and that I may not err in a matter of halakhah and my colleagues rejoice in my [embarrassment], and that I may not call unclean clean or clean unclean, and that my colleagues may not err in a matter of halakhah and that I may rejoice in their [embarrassment].” 
On leaving what does he say? “I give thanks to You, O Lord my God, that You have place my portion with those who sit in the Bet Hamidrash and You have not set my portion with those who sit in [street] corners, for I rise early and they rise early, but I rise early for words of Torah and they rise early for frivolous talk; I labor and they labor, but I labor and receive a reward and they labor and do not receive a reward; I run and they run, but I run to the life of the world to come and they run to the pit of destruction.”
