Berakhot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah continues to teach what blessing one recites when one is eating two foods that have different blessings.

Mishnah Seven
If they brought in front of him salted food at the beginning of the meal and bread with it, he blesses over the salted food and thereby exempts the bread, since the bread is ancillary to it. 
This is the general principle: whenever there is one kind of food that is the main [food] and another that is ancillary, he blesses over the main food and thereby exempts the ancillary.

Explanation
The general rule in this mishnah is straightforward.  If one has two foods to eat together, one recites the blessing over the food that is considered to be the main food and does not need to recite any blessing over the ancillary food.  This is true even if the ancillary food is generally deemed to be the more important of the two, such as bread.  We learned above in mishnah five that if one blesses over bread, he exempts the accompanying food.  Here we learn that if the function of the bread was ancillary to the main food, then he recites the blessing over the main food and thereby exempts the bread.
