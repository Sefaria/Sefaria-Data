Berakhot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Our mishnah completes the list of what blessings are recited over what foods.

Mishnah Three
Over anything which does not grow from the earth one says: “By Whose word all things exist.”
Over milk and cheese and eggs one says, “By Whose word all things exist.” 
Over vinegar, fallen unripe fruit and locusts one says, “By Whose word all things exist.” 
R. Judah says: over anything which is cursed they do not bless at all. 

Explanation
Section one:  Over things that don’t grow from the earth such as meat, fish, cheese, milk, cheese, eggs etc. one recites, “Shehakol nihiye bedvaro.”
Section two:  In this section there is a debate over three food objects that are “cursed.”  Vinegar is “cursed” because it is spoiled wine (they didn’t seem to use it as salad dressing as we do today, although they did put it to some use.)  “Fallen unripe fruit” can be eaten but it is “cursed” because it didn’t stay on the tree/vine until it had reached full ripeness.  Locusts, certain species of which are kosher and are to this day eaten by some Jews, are “cursed” because they destroy crops.  According to the first opinion, one recites “Shehakol” over all three.  One doesn’t recite “Hagefen” (“Who creates the fruit of the vine”) over vinegar because vinegar is not of the same status as wine.  He doesn’t recite “Bore pri ha’etz” over fallen fruit because it is not of the same status as fruit that stayed on the vine until maturation.  Locusts would be “Shehakol” in any case.  
Rabbi Judah disagrees and holds that one doesn’t recite any blessing over these foods.  We shouldn’t thank God for something that we generally consider to be cursed.
