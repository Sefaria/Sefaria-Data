Berakhot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Another debate between the two houses, a debate which again connected to matters of purity and impurity.  The mishnah refers to a towel which was used to dry one’s hands after washing them and to clean them off during eating (they ate with their hands since forks had not yet been invented).  The question is where to place the towel after one has used it to dry one’s hands. It is also important to remember that in mishnaic times they ate reclining on cushions and small tables were brought in front of them on which to serve the food.   

Mishnah Three
Bet Shammai says: he wipes his hand with a towel and then places it on the table.
Bet Hillel says: on the cushion.  

Explanation
After he has washed his hands, he dries them with a towel and he places the towel on the table. Bet Shammai says he shouldn’t place the towel on the cushion upon which he is reclining lest the cushion is impure and the cushion makes the water on the towel become impure and the water in turn impurifies his hands. Bet Shammai does not fear that the table is impure because they hold that it is forbidden to eat off an impure table.  
Bet Hillel holds that he should place the towel on the cushion and even if his hands become impure, impure hands is not a serious form of impurity.  However, he shouldn’t place the towel on the table lest the table is impure and causes the water in the towel to be impure which in turn causes the food on the table to be impure.  While Bet Hillel was not concerned lest one’s hands became impure, they were concerned about the purity of the food.
