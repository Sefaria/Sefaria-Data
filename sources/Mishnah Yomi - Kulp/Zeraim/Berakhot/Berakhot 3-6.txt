Berakhot, Chapter Three, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah deals with people who are already impure who then have contact with semen, either a man through his own semen or a woman through intercourse with a man.  

Mishnah Six
A zav who has had a seminal emission and a niddah from whom semen escapes and a woman who becomes niddah during intercourse require a mikveh. 
Rabbi Judah exempts them. 

Explanation
A zav is a man who has had an abnormal genital discharge.  He is impure for seven days (Leviticus 15:13). Similary, a niddah, a menstruating woman, is impure for seven days.  The mishnah says that if either of these people have contact with semen, the man through an ejaculation or the woman by discharging semen some time after intercourse, or through intercourse itself, they must go to the mikveh due to the contact with semen even though they will still be impure after the mikveh.  Ezra had decreed that anyone who had a seminal emission had to immerse in order to be allowed to study Torah and to pray. This immersion is mandatory even if the person will continue to be impure afterwards.  Furthermore, Ezra prohibited only people who were impure because of semen to study Torah and to pray.  The zav and the niddah are not prohibited even though they too are impure.
Rabbi Judah says that since the immersion will not make them pure, there is no reason for them to immerse.
