Berakhot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our mishnah contains another debate between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel about table manners.

Mishnah Two
Bet Shammai says:  they wash their hands and then they pour the cup [of wine].   
Bet Hillel says: they pour the cup [of wine] and then they wash their hands. 

Explanation
According to Bet Shammai first they wash their hands in order to purify them and only afterwards do they pour the first cup of wine. Bet Shammai fears that if they pour before the hands are washed and purified, some of the wine might get on the outside of the cup and when the person drinking touches the cup he will make them impure and they will then cause the cup to be impure.  
Bet Hillel holds that first the cup should be poured and then the hands washed.  It seems that they hold that the hands must be washed immediately before the food is eaten and that there shouldn’t be any break in between.
Today on days on which Kiddush is recited most people pour the wine, say Kiddush and then wash their hands before they say “Hamotzi,”, the blessing over the bread, and begin the meal.  However, there are some whose custom it is to wash hands before Kiddush and then proceed directly from Kiddush to Hamotzi.
