Berakhot, Chapter Two, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
In mishnah five we learned that Rabban Gamaliel recited the Shema on the first night of his marriage, even though he was exempt.  Today we read of a debate between later sages whether Rabban Gamaliel action sets a precedent for others who might wish to recite the Shema on their wedding night.

Mishnah Eight
If a bridegroom wants to recite the Shema on the first night [of his marriage], he may do so. 
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: not everyone who desires to take up the name of God may do so.

Explanation
According to the first opinion in the mishnah, just as Rabban Gamaliel recited the Shema on the first night of his wedding, so too anybody can.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel,  Rabban Gamaliel’s own son, says that his father was an exception.  Not everyone can accept upon himself the responsibility of saying the Shema in a situation in which the sages exempted the person.  
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel seems to have an almost entirely different conception of halakhah. Whereas his father considered the halakhah to be geared to the “normal” or “typical” situation and allowed deviations under abnormal circumstances, his son limits these deviations. According to Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, halakhah is not just a descriptive norm, but a mandated norm, and even though one does not feel that he fits into this norm, the halakhah establishes that he must.  In our case, if one feels that he is capable of concentrating sufficiently to recite the Shema on his wedding night, he is still not allowed to do so. The halakhah mandates his exemption and doesn’t just allow him to not recite it.  
It seems to me that later halakhah is more often understood in the terms of Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel.  Halakhah mandates laws across the board, usually not making exceptions for the individual psyche.  But this is far too broad a topic for this forum.
