Berakhot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Five

Introduction 
This mishnah continues to deal with making mistakes while reciting the Tefillah.

Mishnah Five
One who is praying and makes a mistake, it is a bad sign for him. 
And if he is the messenger of the congregation (the prayer leader) it is a bad sign for those who have sent him, because one’s messenger is equivalent to one’s self. 
They said about Rabbi Hanina ben Dosa that he used to pray for the sick and say, “This one will die, this one will live.” They said to him: “How do you know?” He replied: “If my prayer comes out fluently, I know that he is accepted, but if not, then I know that he is rejected.”  

Explanation
Section one:  Making a mistake while reciting the Tefillah is considered to be a bad omen, both for the person himself and if he is acting as prayer leader (the “one who goes before the ark”) then for the congregation as well.  Again, we must keep in mind that they did not have siddurim back then.  Reciting the Tefillah required one to know the Tefillah by heart.  It seems that they conceived of the Tefillah as flowing through the person reciting it as if it was coming from God, as if it was prophecy.  If the prayer flows well, then it is a sign of God’s presence and favor.  If the prayer does not flow well, it is a sign of disfavor.
Section two: The story in this section shows the magical/prophetic powers that they attributed to prayer and how well one recites it.  Rabbi Hanina believed that the flow of his prayer through him was an omen, for good or for bad, for the sick person over whom he was praying.
