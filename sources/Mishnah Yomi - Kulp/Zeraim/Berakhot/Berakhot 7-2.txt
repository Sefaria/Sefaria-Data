Berakhot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah continues the topic of yesterday’s mishnah, when is a “zimun,” an invitation to Birkat Hamazon, recited.
	
Mishnah Two
Women, children and slaves—they do not recite an invitation over them. 
How much [must one have eaten] in order for them to recite an invitation? 
As much as an olive.
Rabbi Judah says:  as much as an egg.

Explanation
Section one:  The invitation to Birkat Hamazon is only recited for adult, free men.  In rabbinic thinking, as in the thinking of most of their contemporaries, only adult free men count as full “citizens” in the Greco-Roman sense of the word. Only they are full members of society and hence a formal meal is constituted by their presence and not by the presence of women, children and slaves.
Section two:  According to the first opinion, to count in a zimun one need only an olive’s worth of food. This accords with the opinion in yesterday’s mishnah, that if the attendant (not a slave) eats an olive’s worth of food, he may join in the zimun.  In contrast, Rabbi Judah sets a higher threshold of an egg’s worth.  One who eats less than an egg is not required to recite Birkat Hamazon and does not participate in a zimun.
