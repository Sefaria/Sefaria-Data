Berakhot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Towards the end of the next to last blessing of the Tefillah the priests raise their hands and bless the people with the “priestly blessing” (birkat hakohanim) from Numbers 6:24-26 (see also Sotah 7:6).  Our mishnah contains several rules regarding the priestly blessing and the one who is “passing before the ark” i.e. leading the Tefillah.

Mishnah Four
The one who passes before the ark should not respond Amen after [the blessings of] the priests because this might confuse him. 
If there is no priest there except himself, he should not raise his hands [to recite the priestly blessing], but if he is confident that he can raise his hands and go back to his place in his prayer, he is permitted to do so.

Explanation
Section one:  After each of the three sections of the priestly blessing the congregation responds by saying Amen. The person passing before the ark should not respond Amen because that might confuse him and he might lose track of where he is in the Tefillah. We should note how concerned they were with the prayer leader losing track of his place because they didn’t have siddurim.
Section two:  If the person leading the Tefillah is the only priest he should not recite the priestly blessing unless he is sure that it won’t confuse him.  However, if there are other priests he should let them do the priestly blessing and he should remain quiet.  I should note that this is a practical issue in many congregations in Israel where the priestly blessing is recited every day.  The normal practice is that when the person leading the service is the only priest, he does recite the priestly blessing.  There are debates about whether he recites the blessing even if there are other priests present.
