Bikkurim, Chapter One, Mishnah Eleven

Introduction
The final mishnah of this chapter relates back to mishnayot two and six.

Mishnah Three
One who bought three trees in another’s field, he brings [bikkurim] and recites.   
Rabbi Meir says: even [if he bought] only two.   
If he bought one tree with its land, he brings [bikkurim] and recites. 
Rabbi Judah says: even sharecroppers and leasers bring and recite. 

Explanation
Section one: In mishnah six we learned that if a person buys two trees, he is not considered to have bought the land on which the trees grow. He brings bikkurim but he doesn’t recite. We learn today the obvious inference: if he buys three trees the land is his and he must bring and recite. Rabbi Meir says that even one who buys two trees is considered to have bought the land and he brings and recites. The same opinion was found in mishnah six.
Section two: The above section dealt with a person who bought the trees but did not explicitly buy the land. If he explicitly buys the land that the tree grows on he brings and recites, even if he only bought one tree.
Section three: Rabbi Judah disagrees with the opinion found in mishnah two, that one who doesn’t own the land on which the produce grows does not brings the bikkurim. Rabbi Judah holds that a sharecropper’s and a leaser’s grasp on the land is sufficient enough to cause them to be liable to bring bikkurim and make the declaration as well.
