Bikkurim, Chapter Three, Mishnah One

Introduction
Chapter three discusses how bikkurim were set aside and then it goes on to describe the festive ceremony of the bringing of the bikkurim to the Temple in Jerusalem.

Mishnah One 
How does one set aside bikkurim? 
A man goes down into his field, he sees a fig that ripened, or a cluster of grapes that ripened, or a pomegranate that ripened, he ties a reed-rope around it and says: “Let these be bikkurim.”  
Rabbi Shimon says: even so, he must again designate them as bikkurim after they have been plucked from the soil.

Explanation
Section one: Unlike most agricultural gifts, such as terumah and maaser, that are designated as such only once they have been plucked from the soil, bikkurim are set aside as soon as they begin to ripen, while they are still attached to the ground. In order to remember which fruits he designated as bikkurim, he ties a rope around them. When he harvests the figs, grapes or pomegranates, he need not designate them again as bikkurim.
Section two: Rabbi Shimon holds that even though he designated them as bikkurim while they were still attached to the ground, he must designate them again as bikkurim when he harvests them.
