Bikkurim, Chapter One, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
The first part of our mishnah explains the scriptural source for yesterday’s mishnah where we learned that one is responsible to bring replacement bikkurim if his original bikkurim were either lost or ruined.
The second part of the mishnah deals with a person who brings bikkurim on two separate occasions.

Mishnah Nine
From where do we know that one is responsible [for his bikkurim] until he brings them to the temple Mount? Because it says: “The first of the first-fruits of your land you shall bring into the house of the Lord your God” (Exodus 23:19) this teaches that he is responsible until he brings them to the Temple Mount. 
If he brought [bikkurim] of one kind and made the recital and then brought of another kind, he does not make a [second] recital.  

Explanation
Section one: According to the rabbinic reading of this verse, it is not sufficient to just set aside one’s first fruits, one must bring them to the Temple in Jerusalem. If one cannot because they were lost or ruined, then he must set aside new first fruits in their place, as we learned in yesterday’s mishnah. 
Section two: If he brought bikkurim of one kind on one occasion, and then came back to the Temple on another occasion with bikkurim of another kind, he cannot make the declaration again. The declaration can be made only on one occasion. Even Rabbi Judah, who said in mishnah seven that if a person sells his field, the purchaser can bring bikkurim from the same species that the previous owner already brought, would agree here that one person cannot make the recital twice.
