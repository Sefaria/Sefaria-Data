Bikkurim, Chapter One, Mishnah Ten

Introduction 
This mishnah lists those who bring bikkurim and make the declaration.

Mishnah Ten
These bring and recite: 
[One who brings bikkurim] from Atzeret until the Festival [of Sukkot], from the seven species, from fruit grown on the mountains, or dates grown in the valleys, from oil-olives, and from [produce] from the other side of the Jordan.   
Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: one does not bring [bikkurim] from transjordania, since that is not a land flowing with milk and honey.

Explanation
Section one: Most of this list is just the opposite of those cases found in mishnah three, where we learned who doesn’t bring bikkurim. The one new piece of information in this mishnah is the issue of produce from the other side of the Jordan (also called Transjordan). According to the first opinion, since the Transjordan is “the land the Lord promised to our ancestors” (Deuteronomy 26:3) one can and must bring produce from this region.
Section two: In contrast, Rabbi Yose the Galilean holds that one does not bring bikkurim from the other side of the Jordan because that is not considered to be a “land flowing with milk and honey” and in his recitation he mentions these words (verse 9).
