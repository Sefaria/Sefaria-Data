Bikkurim, Chapter Three, Mishnah Eleven


Mishnah Eleven
When did they say that the additions to the bikkurim are like bikkurim [themselves]? When they come from the land [of Israel]; but if they do not come from the land, they were not regarded as bikkurim [themselves].

Explanation
This mishnah clarifies a point in yesterday’s mishnah. Additions to bikkurim have the halakhic status of bikkurim only if they are brought from the land of Israel. If they are brought from outside of the land, for instance from Transjordan which is in according to some opinions liable for bikkurim (see 1:10), then they don’t have the same status as bikkurim. This means they will be liable for demai and they can be eaten while impure.
