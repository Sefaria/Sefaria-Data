Maaser Sheni, Chapter Four, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
If one redeemed maaser sheni but did not call it by its name:   
Rabbi Yose says: it is sufficient. 
But Rabbi Judah says: he must name it explicitly. 
If a man was speaking to a woman concerning her divorce or her betrothal, and gave her a get or betrothal money but did not state explicitly [what he was doing]:
Rabbi Yose says: it is sufficient. 
But Rabbi Judah says: he must say it explicitly.

Explanation
Section one: When one redeems maaser sheni he should declare that these coins are now maaser sheni. If he redeems the produce without declaring that the coins are maaser sheni, Rabbi Yose says it is sufficient. Rabbi Judah disagrees and says that without declaring that the coins are maaser sheni, the redemption has not been done.
Section two: A similar halakhah is related concerning marriage and divorce. If a man and woman are talking about their divorce or betrothal and he gives her a get (a divorce document) or betrothal money (kiddushin) without saying, “Behold, this is your get” or “Behold, you are betrothed to me” according to Rabbi Yose, she is betrothed or divorced, whereas Rabbi Judah says that he must state explicitly what he is doing.
