Maaser Sheni, Chapter Five, Mishnah Thirteen

Introduction
You guessed it—more midrash!
The confession has now turned from what the confessor, and by extension all of Israel, claims to have done, to the blessings that the confessor is asking. The confession might be understood as a petition to fulfill a contract—we have fulfilled our side of the bargain, Israel is saying, now we ask of You, God, to fulfill yours.
The midrashim themselves should be self-understood, so I have not commented below.

Mishnah Thirteen 
“Look down from Your holy abode, from heaven” — We have done what You decreed upon us, You too do what You have promised us. 
“Look down from Your holy abode, from heaven, and bless Your people Israel” — with sons and daughters. 
“And the land which You have given us” — with dew and rain and with offspring of cattle. 
“As You swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey”— that You may give a good taste to the produce.
