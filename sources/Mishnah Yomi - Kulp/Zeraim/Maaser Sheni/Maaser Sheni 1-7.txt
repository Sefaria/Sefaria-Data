Maaser Sheni, Chapter One, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
The final mishnah of this chapter lists other things that one cannot buy with maaser sheni money. 

Mishnah Seven
One may not buy male slaves or female slaves, land, or unclean animals with maaser sheni money. 
And if he did buy [one of these], its value must be consumed [as maaser sheni in Jerusalem].   
One may not bring bird-offerings of a zav or zavah, or bird-offerings of women after child-birth, or sin-offerings, or guilt-offerings, from maaser sheni money.
And if he did buy [one of these], their value must be consumed [as maaser sheni in Jerusalem].
This is the general rule: whatever [is bought] out of maaser sheni money which cannot be used for eating or drinking or anointing, its value must be consumed [as maaser sheni in Jerusalem].

Explanation
Section one:  None of these are food and therefore one cannot use maaser sheni money to purchase them. If one does, he must purchase and eat an equivalent amount of food in Jerusalem. This is the standard rule when one buys something with maaser sheni money that should not have been bought. It is stated more explicitly below in section three.
Section two: All of these are mandatory offerings, unlike shelamim offerings which are voluntary. According to the rabbis, one cannot use maaser sheni money to buy offerings which he/she would have had to bring in any case. 
The zav and zavah are a man or woman who had an abnormal genital discharge (see Leviticus 15:14). They bring bird-offerings after they become pure, as does the woman after childbirth.
Section three: This is the general rule stated twice above.
