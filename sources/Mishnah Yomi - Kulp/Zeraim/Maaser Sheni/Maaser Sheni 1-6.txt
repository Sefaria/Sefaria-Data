Maaser Sheni, Chapter One, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah teaches the same rule that we saw in yesterday’s mishnah, except whereas yesterday’s mishnah discussed produce, today’s mishnah refers to buying an animal.

Mishnah Six
One who bought a domesticated animal unwittingly, the money must be restored to its former place.
Intentionally, it must be taken up and eaten in the [holy] place.
And when there is no Temple, it must be buried together with its hide.  

Explanation
The same exact rules that applied to the produce apply to the animal. 
If there is no Temple, then the animal can never be eaten, nor can it be used for work. Rather he should leave it alone until it dies, and then bury it together with its hide. The mishnah emphasizes that even the hide, which is not food and which remains hullin if the animal was purchased for a sacrifice (see mishnah three), is forbidden and it must be buried.
