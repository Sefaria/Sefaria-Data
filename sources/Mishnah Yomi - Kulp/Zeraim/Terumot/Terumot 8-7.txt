Terumot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
In our mishnah there is a dispute concerning a wine jug covered by a filter. According to the first opinion, poison can pass through the filter and therefore the wine is halakhically considered to be uncovered and it is prohibited. Rabbi Nehemiah says that the poison will not pass through the filter and hence it is permitted. 

Mishnah Seven 
A wine-filter [used as a cover] does not prevent [the wine from becoming] forbidden by being uncovered.   
But Rabbi Nehemiah permits it.
