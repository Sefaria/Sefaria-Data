Terumot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Nine

Mishnah Nine
A jar [of terumah] was broken in the upper part of the wine-press, and the lower part was unclean: 
Both Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua agree that if one can save at least a reviit of it in cleanness he should save it.
But if not:
Rabbi Eliezer says: let it flow down and become unclean of its own accord, and let him not make it unclean with his own hands.

Explanation
Section one: Our mishnah deals with a case where there is a jar of pure terumah in the upper part of a wine-press, and the lower part of the wine-press contains impure hullin wine. If the terumah flows down to the lower part it will all become impure medumma (doubtful terumah) and no one will be able to drink it—not a priest because it is impure and not an Israelite, because it contains terumah. The person does not have any pure vessels handy with which to immediately save the terumah. Both Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua agree that if he can fetch clean vessels and save at least a reviit of pure terumah wine before it all flows into the lower part he should do so. In other words, rather than save all of the terumah wine in impure vessels, he should save a small amount of it in a pure vessel, even though the rest of the terumah wine will render undrinkable the hullin in the lower part.
Section two: Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua debate what to do in a situation in which it is impossible to save a reviit before the terumah flows down into the lower parts. Rabbi Eliezer says he should just let it all flow into the impure hullin below and that he should not defile the terumah with his own hands by putting it into unclean vessels, even though this will make the hullin below undrinkable for everyone. Rabbi Joshua’s response to Rabbi Eliezer will come mishnah eleven below, so stay tuned!
