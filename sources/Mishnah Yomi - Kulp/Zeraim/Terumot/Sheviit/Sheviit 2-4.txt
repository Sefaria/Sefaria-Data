Sheviit, Chapter Two, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
They may besmear saplings, wrap them around, and trim them, and they may make for them shelters and water them until Rosh Hashanah.   
Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says: he may even water the foliage on the sabbatical year, but not the roots.  

Explanation
Section one:  The activities in this section are meant to protect the saplings and therefore they are permitted all the way up until Rosh Hashanah.  
Besmearing the saplings means to repair bark that is peeling.  Another interpretation is that it refers to smearing oil on the trees in order to ward off bugs.
Wrapping the trees is done in order to protect them.  
Trimming them is similar to those activities referred to in the previous mishnah, all of which were permitted up until Rosh Hashanah.  
The shelters are small structures to protect the saplings from the elements.  
The irrigation here refers to spraying or sprinkling them with water to keep them moist.
Section two:  Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says that he can water the foliage even on the sabbatical year, because that is just to keep them moist.  However, he may not water the roots because it is the seventh year.
