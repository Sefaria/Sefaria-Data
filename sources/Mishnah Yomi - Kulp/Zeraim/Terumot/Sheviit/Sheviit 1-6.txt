Sheviit, Chapter One, Mishnah Six

Introduction 
This mishnah teaches that if instead of adult trees the trees were young saplings, then the rule is different because young saplings require far more watering and care then do adult trees.

Mishnah Six
If ten saplings are scattered over the entire area of a bet seah, they may plow the whole bet seah, even until Rosh Hashanah.   
But if they were arranged in a row or they were surrounded by a fence, they may plow them only for their own needs.

Explanation
Section one:  When it came to adult trees, in order for it to be permitted to plow the entire field, the mishnah required three trees that produce a minimal amount of fruit. When it comes to saplings, if there are ten saplings in the field they may plow the entire field all the way up to Rosh Hashanah, without any “tosefet sheviit”—extension of the sabbatical year.
Section two:  However, if the saplings are not spread out through the entire field, but are rather set up in a row, then the entire field may not be plowed.  Alternatively, if the saplings are surrounded by a fence, one that does not surround the entire field but just those saplings, then they are treated as individual trees and the remainder of the field may not be plowed. The reason is that since they are concentrated in one area, if someone plows the whole field, it will look like he is getting the field ready to be planted on the sabbatical year.
