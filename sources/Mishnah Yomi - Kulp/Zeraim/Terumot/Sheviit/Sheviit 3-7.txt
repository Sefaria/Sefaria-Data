Sheviit, Chapter Three, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with the topic of removing stones from one’s field on the sabbatical year.

Mishnah Seven
Stones which the plow has turned up, or which had been covered and became uncovered, if there are among them at least two, [each] the load of two men, they may be removed.   
One who removes stones from his field, he removes the top layers, but he leave those touching the ground.   
And likewise a heap of pebbles, or a pile of stones; he may remove the top layers but must leave those touching the ground. 
If, however, there is beneath them rocky soil or stubble, they may be removed.

Explanation
Section one:  If some stones turn up unexpectedly in one’s field, he is allowed to remove them if there are at least two of them and if each of those two is so large it requires two men to carry them.  In such a case the one who sees the person removing these stones will not think that he is simply clearing his field in order to plant. Rather the observer will realize that he is removing the stones in order to use the stones in building. Note that in this case he is allowed to remove not only the large stones but the other stones as well.
Section two: If one needs to remove stones from his field in order to use them in building, he can remove the top layers but not the bottom layers.  The reason that he has to leave the bottom layers is to make sure that people don’t think that he is clearing the field in order to prepare it for planting.
Section three: The same rule applies if he is removing a heap of pebbles or a pile of stones.  Again, he may remove the top layers but not the bottom.
Section four:  If below the pebbles or stones there is still rocky soil, soil that can’t be used for growing, then he may even remove the bottom layer, because it is clearly not being done in preparation for sewing seed.
