Sheviit, Chapter Three, Mishnah Six

Introduction 
This mishnah discusses removing a stone wall during sheviit. Again, we are concerned lest it appear that he is clearing his field in order to plant there.

Mishnah Six
A wall that consists of ten stones, each a load for two men, may be removed, [if] the measurement of this wall is [at least] ten handbreadths high.
Less than that he quarries it and he may lower it to within one handbreadth of the ground.  
When is this so? From his own field, but from that of another, he may remove whatever he wishes.   
When is this so? When he did not begin [to remove the stones] in the sixth year, but if he began in the sixth year, he may remove whatever he wishes. 

Explanation
Section one:  If the wall is ten handbreadths high and there are at least ten heavy stones there, then he can remove the entire wall because it will be clear that he is removing a wall and not clearing his field in order to plant. It seems that if there is really a wall there, it will be clearer to everyone what he is doing. 
Section two:  If the wall is smaller then he cannot just remove the whole thing.  Rather he may remove individual stones, until he lowers it to within one handbreadth of the ground.  Leaving that one handbreadth will make it clear to everyone that he is not clearing the wall so that he can plant there.
Section three:  The mishnah now presents two exceptions to the previous rule.  The first is that the rule applies only to a wall in his own field.  If the wall is in another person’s field, he may remove the whole thing because it is unusual for a person to clear a wall in order to plant another person’s field.  
Section four: The second exception is if he had begun to remove stones from the wall in the sixth year.  If he had begun the previous year, then it will seem clearer to everyone who sees him that he is just removing stones and not clearing the field for planting.
