Sheviit, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Our mishnah teaches that one generally is not allowed to pay workers with money that was gained from selling sheviit produce. However, under certain circumstances this is permitted. 

Mishnah Five
They may not pay [sheviit proceeds to] a well-digger, an attendant at a public bath, a barber, or a sailor. 
But he may give them to well-digger so that the well-digger will provide him with drink. 
To all of them he may give it as a gift. 

Explanation
Section one: This section teaches that one cannot use sheviit money, money that was used to buy sheviit produce, to pay a workerâ€™s wages even if those wages will go to a person who is providing a service that the receiver bodily enjoys. Sheviit money can be used to buy food and drink. We might have thought that since food and drink are things that the body enjoys, one could use sheviit money to buy other things that the body enjoys, such as a hair cut, water to wash, a bath or even a trip on a boat. The mishnah teaches that sheviit money cannot be used even for these purposes.
Section two: However, if the well-digger is going to provide water for drinking and not just for washing, then one may pay him with sheviit money. This is akin to buying water directly with sheviit money which is, as we have stated, permitted.
Section three: One can give sheviit money to his employees as a gift, a bonus over their regular payment, even though this looks as if he is paying them with sheviit money.
