Sheviit, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah contains one of the most famous “takkanot” or pieces of halakhic legislation in the Mishnah. The takkanah is called the “prozbul” and was meant to be a way to prevent the sabbatical year from causing loans to be remitted. We shall see why Hillel made this takkanah inside the mishnah.

Mishnah Three 
[A loan secured by] a prozbul  is not cancelled. 
This was one of the things enacted by Hillel the elder; for when he observed people refraining from lending to one another, and thus transgressing what is written in the Torah, “Beware, lest you harbor the base thought, [‘The seventh year, the year of remission, is approaching,’ so that you are mean to your needy kinsman and give him nothing.”   
Hillel enacted the prozbul.

Explanation
Section one: The prozbul was a document that a person would write before the seventh year and through it he would transfer his debts to the court. We shall learn more about how this document works in tomorrow’s mishnah. By using the prozbul document, a person’s could collect from his debtors after the seventh year.
Section two: At first it might seem that the prozbul would have been detrimental to the poor. After all, the sabbatical year was designed to give them relief from their debts by causing all loans to be remitted after the seventh year. However, the Torah already anticipated that this might cause lenders to be extremely hesitant about giving out loans. After all, these loans were an act of charity because they couldn’t charge interest.  Hillel saw that the sabbatical year’s remission of loans would ultimately cause the poor to suffer by making loans unavailable to them. Therefore, in order to aid people in getting loans, he had to secure the creditor’s ability to be repaid—hence he enacted the prozbul.
