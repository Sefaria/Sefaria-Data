Sheviit, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Eleven

Mishnah Eleven
A bath heated with straw or stubble of the seventh year, it is permitted to wash in it.  
But if he is an important man, he should not wash in it. 

Explanation
Section one: It is forbidden to burn straw and stubble that grow in the seventh year because they could be used for animal food. However, if he did use them to heat up a bath, the bathwater may be used. 
Other commentators explain that it is completely permitted to use straw and stubble to heat up a bath because this is something for human “consumption” and we have learned before that something that is not used as food for a human can be used to make a salve. 
Section two: If he is an important man, then he should act more stringently and not use the straw and stubble to heat up a bath, because people might learn from his actions that they can use all sabbatical produce for any use. 
Another explanation is that if he is an important, honorable man, they might burn for him sheviit products that one is not allowed to burn, such as edible food items that might smell good.
