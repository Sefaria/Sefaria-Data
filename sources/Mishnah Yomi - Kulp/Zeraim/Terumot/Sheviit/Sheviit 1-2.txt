Sheviit, Chapter One, Mishnah Two

Introduction 
In yesterdayâ€™s mishnah we learned up until what point before the sabbatical year one may plow an orchard. Today we learn how many trees in a field are necessary for it to be considered an orchard. If it is not considered an orchard, then they will have to stop plowing the field at an earlier point in the year.

Mishnah Two
What constitutes an orchard? Any field in which there are at least three trees for every bet seah.  
If each tree is capable of yielding a cake of pressed figs, the size of sixty in the Italian maneh, then the entire bet seah may be plowed for their sake.  
If less than this amount, they may only plow the area that is occupied by the gatherer when his basket is placed behind him.

Explanation
Section one: A bet seah is 2500 square cubits. If there are three trees in a field this size, then the bet seah can be treated as an orchard. 
Section two:  The three trees that constitute this orchard must each be able to produce a cake of pressed figs the size of sixty Italian manehs.  According to commentators, this is about 24kg. If these two criteria are filled, than they may plow the entire bet seah until Shavuot, since the plowing of the entire field benefits all the trees.
Section three:  However, if there are fewer trees or they produce less fruit, then they may plow only around those trees. The space they may plow is the size of a fruit-gatherer and his basket, as he walks around the tree.  The rest of the field has more stringent rules, those which apply to a grain field, which may only be plowed until Pesah, as we shall see in chapter two below.
