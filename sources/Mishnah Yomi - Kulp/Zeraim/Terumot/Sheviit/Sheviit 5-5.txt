Sheviit, Chapter Five, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
From when may one buy luf after the seventh year?   
Rabbi Judah says: immediately.   
But the sages say: [only] after the new crop has appeared.  

Explanation
Our mishnah discusses when a person can begin to sell luf after the seventh year is over without people suspecting that the luf was sabbatical year produce. 
According to Rabbi Judah, he may begin to sell it immediately. Although, as we shall see when it comes to vegetables, anything bought after the seventh year must be treated like seventh year produce until enough time has passed for new vegetables to grow, with luf they were less stringent because we can assume that luf in the eighth year is actually from the sixth year.  
The other rabbis hold that luf is treated the same way as other vegetablesâ€”it too is forbidden until there has been enough time for a new crop to appear.
