Sheviit, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
In this mishnah the rabbis and Rabbi Eliezer debate whether a beehive, resting on the ground, is considered to have the status of land. As we shall see, there are halakhic consequences to it either being considered land or not.

Mishnah Seven
A bee-hive:
Rabbi Eliezer says: Behold, it is like land and a prozbul may be written [using it as security] and it is not susceptible to uncleanness while it remains in its place, and one who takes honey from it on Shabbat is liable.   
But the sages say: it is not like land, a prozbul may not be written [using it as security], it is susceptible to uncleanness while in its place, and one who takes honey from it on Shabbat is exempt.

Explanation
Section one: According to Rabbi Eliezer, the beehive has the status of land. The mishnah lists three consequences to this determination.
1) If the debtor owns a beehive, a prozbul may be written using just the beehive as security, even though he owns no actual land. This is a topic that we covered in yesterday’s mishnah.
2) Land and anything that is considered attached to it (such as plants or houses) is not susceptible to impurity. Thus, according to Rabbi Eliezer, the beehive cannot become impure. However, this is only true while it remains in its place. If the beehive was picked up and moved elsewhere, it can become susceptible to impurity.
3) One who plucks something from the land is liable for a Shabbat transgression. Hence, according to Rabbi Eliezer, one who removes honey from a beehive on Shabbat is liable.
Section two: The rabbis do not consider the beehive to be “land” and therefore, in all three of these halakhot, they rule opposite of Rabbi Eliezer.
