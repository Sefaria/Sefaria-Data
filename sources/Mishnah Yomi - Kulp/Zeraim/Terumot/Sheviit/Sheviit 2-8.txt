Sheviit, Chapter Two, Mishnah Nine

Introduction 
This mishnah continues to list types of produce that are tithed according to when they take root.

Mishnah Nine
Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: Egyptian beans which he sowed for seed only, are like them.   
Rabbi Shimon says: large beans, are [also] like them.
But Rabbi Elazar says: large beans, if they began to form pods before Rosh Hashanah.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Rabbi Shimon Shezuri if Egyptians beans were sewn for seeds, which either means to grow them in order to harvest just the seeds, or according to other commentators, to eat the seeds, then they are tithed according to when they take root.  If, however, they were planted in order to eat the beans, then they are tithed as are vegetables, according to the time when they were harvested.
Section two:  Rabbi Shimon says that large beans also go according to when they take root.
Section three: Rabbi Elazar says that large beans go according to their own criterionâ€”when they begin to form pods.  If they do so before Rosh Hashanah, they are tithed according to the previous year, but if not, they are tithed according to the subsequent year.
