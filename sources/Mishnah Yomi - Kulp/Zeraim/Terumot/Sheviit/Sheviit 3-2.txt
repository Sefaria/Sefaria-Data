Sheviit, Chapter Three, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah continues to discuss bringing out manure to make dung-heaps.  This mishnah teaches how many dung-heaps may be made and how big they must be to avoid giving the appearance that one is fertilizing the field.

Mishnah Two
How much manure may they take out and make into dung-heaps?  
Three dung-heaps for every bet seah, [each consisting of] ten baskets [of foliage] of a letekh each. 
They may add to the number of baskets, but not to the number of heaps.   
Rabbi Shimon says: also to the number of heaps.

Explanation
Section one: The mishnah wants to limit the number of dung-heaps and their size so that it does not look like the person bringing them out is fertilizing the field.  Therefore, there is a limit to how many dung-heaps may be piled up.  They can only make three piles. Furthermore, each heap must contain at least ten baskets of dung, and each basket must contains a letekh (=15 seah). In total, each pile must contain 150 seah of manure.  Less than that, and the rabbis fear that it may look like he is fertilizing his field.
Section two:  If he wants he can add to the number of baskets he brings out. In other words, there is a minimum of ten baskets, but if he wishes he can add more.  However, he cannot make more heaps because that looks like he is fertilizing the field.
Rabbi Shimon says that he can even add to the number of heaps. Evidently more large heaps do not, according to Rabbi Shimon, make it look like one is fertilizing the field.
