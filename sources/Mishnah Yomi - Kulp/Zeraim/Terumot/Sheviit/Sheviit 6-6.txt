Sheviit, Chapter Six, Mishhnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah deals with bringing terumah from outside of the land of Israel into Israel.

Mishnah Six
They may not import terumah from outside the land of Israel into Israel.   
Rabbi Shimon said: I have heard it expressly stated that they may be bring from Syria, but not from any other country outside the land.

Explanation
Section one: The rabbis forbade importing terumah lest this encourage priests to go outside of the land of Israel and bring terumah back with them. This prohibition was created in order to discourage people from moving out of the land. It seems that they were not concerned lest a kohen move outside of Israel permanently because the terumah he received there could not be brought back with him.  
Section two: As he did with regard to yesterdayâ€™s mishnah, Rabbi Shimon says that Syria is exceptional and that a kohen who goes to Syria to get terumah can bring it back with him. Assumedly, he was not concerned lest the kohen travel too much to Syria to get terumah, because Syria is almost a part of the land of Israel.
