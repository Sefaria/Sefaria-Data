Sheviit, Chapter Seven, Chapter Six

Mishnah Six
The rose, henna, balsam, the lotus tree—the laws of sheviit apply to them and to their money substitutes.   
Rabbi Shimon says: sheviit does not apply to the balsam, since it is not a fruit. 

Explanation
Section one: According to the first opinion in the mishnah, since these plants are used for perfumes, the laws of sheviit apply to them. Perfume is close enough to food and dyes that it is included in the laws of sheviit. With regard to the laws of removal, they will apply to any of them, such as the rose, that will rot if left in the ground. 
Section two: Sheviit does not apply to the balsam, according to Rabbi Shimon, because the balsam is not a fruit but rather wood—and the laws of sheviit do not apply to things considered “wood.”
