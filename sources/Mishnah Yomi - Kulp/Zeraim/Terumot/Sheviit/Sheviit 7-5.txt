Sheviit, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah deals with the young branches of various trees. These soft branches were eaten and therefore we need to know whether the laws of sheviit apply to them.

Mishnah Five 
The lulavim of hawthorn trees and carobs—the laws of sheviit apply to them and to their money substitutes, the law of removal applies to them and to their money substitutes. 
The lulavim of the terebinth, the pistachio tree and the white thorn, the laws of sheviit apply to them and to their money substitutes, but the law of removal does not apply to them and to their money substitutes.   
But as for the leaves the law of removal applies, since they fall from their stem.  

Explanation
Section one: The lulavim, that is the young, soft branches of hawthorn and carob trees, are edible and will rot if left on the tree. Therefore the laws of sheviit fully apply to them.
Section two: The lulavim of these trees, while edible, can remain on the tree indefinitely. As we learned in mishnah two above, if something can remain attached to the ground without rotting, then the laws of removing that produce from one’s home do not apply. One could therefore cut down such lulavim and preserve them in one’s home for as long as he wants. 
Section three: Although the laws of removal do not apply to the lulavim because they can remain on the tree, the laws do apply to the leaves because they be left on the tree without rotting.
