Sheviit, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with what one does with sabbatical year produce at the time of removal.

Mishnah Eight
If one had sabbatical produce [at home] and the time of removal had come, he may give out food for three meals to every one.   
Rabbi Judah says: the poor may eat from it even after the removal, but not the rich.   
But Rabbi Yose says: both the poor and the rich may eat after the removal.

Explanation
Section one: The first thing that one may do with the sabbatical produce when it is time to remove it from one’s home is to give enough of it for three meals to any person he knows. Anything he can’t give away to people that he knows he must take out of his house and publicly declare, “My fellow Jews, anyone who needs to take should come and take.” 
Section two: According to Rabbi Judah, only poor people may come and take from this food. This is derived from Exodus 23:11, “Let the needy among your people eat of it.” Some interpret this to mean that the owner of the field who produced this food may not reclaim it for himself but all others may. 
Section three: Rabbi Yose holds that not only the poor but also the rich may eat of this produce after the removal. According to this reading of Rabbi Yose’s words, the removal is somewhat of a formality, because after he removes it from his home and makes the declaration he may go back and reclaim it.
The Rambam seems to have a different reading altogether. He holds that neither the poor nor the rich may eat of it. According to the Rambam removal means giving three meals worth of the food to any relatives, friends or acquaintances and then actually destroying whatever is left over.
