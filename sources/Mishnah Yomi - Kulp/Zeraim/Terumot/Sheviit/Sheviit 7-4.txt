Sheviit, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Four

Introduction
In yesterday’s mishnah we learned that it is prohibited to engage in the business of buying and selling first-born animals or prohibited animals. Our mishnah teaches that under certain circumstances, one may sell such animals.
 
Mishnah Four
If one buys a first-born animal for his son’s [wedding] feast, or for a festival, and then decides that he has no need for it, he may sell it.   
Trappers of wild animals, birds and fishes, who chanced upon unclean species, may sell them.   
Rabbi Judah says: also a man who happened to chance one upon by accident may buy or sell, provided that he does not make this into his regular profession. 
But the sages prohibit. 

Explanation
Section one:  The first-born animal referred to in this mishnah is one which has a physical flaw. Such an animal may be eaten, even by non-priests. If a person buys such an animal in order to use it in a “mitzvah meal” such as his son’s wedding or a festival, and then he decides that he does not need it, he can sell it. Clearly this is not a case of a person intending to make a trade in first-born animals, but rather just avoiding a loss.
Section two: If a non-kosher animal, bird or fish happens into a trapper’s trap, the trapper may sell it to a non-Jew since his intention was to catch kosher animals, birds or fish. He need not just let them go.
Section three: Rabbi Judah goes a step further. If a person happens to chance upon a non-kosher animal, bird or fish he can buy it and then sell it. This is clearly a much greater leniency than that found in the previous section. It seems that Rabbi Judah holds that as long as one doesn’t make trade in non-kosher things his regular profession, he can engage in an occasional trade.
The other rabbis disagree with Rabbi Judah and prohibit this. Buying the non-kosher animal when the intention is going to be to sell it is too close to engaging in business with such animals and is therefore prohibited.
