Terumot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a person who accidentally feeds his workers or his guests terumah.

Mishnah Three
If one gives his workmen or his guests terumah to eat he must repay the principal and they must pay the fifth, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
But the sages say: they must pay both the value and the fifth, and he must pay them for the price of their meal.  

Explanation
Section one: According to Rabbi Meir, the person who gave them the terumah pays the principal, the amount that the terumah was actually worth. Since these were his guests or workers, people whom he had an obligation to feed, he has benefited by fulfilling this duty. Therefore, he has to pay back the amount that they ate to the kohen. On the other hand, they were the ones who actually ate the terumah, and therefore, they are the ones who pay back the added fifth.
Section two: The sages hold that since they were the ones who ate the food, they have to pay back the terumah to the priest, both the principal and the added fifth. However, since he gave them food that they shouldnâ€™t have eaten, meaning he did not fulfill his duty, he has to pay them back the value of the food they ate. In this case, since they ate terumah which has lower value then regular produce, he will end up paying them back less than the amount that they will have to pay.
