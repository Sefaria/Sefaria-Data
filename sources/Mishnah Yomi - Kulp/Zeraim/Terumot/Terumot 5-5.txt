Terumot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah deals with the status of the one seah that is taken out of the 100-1 hullin/terumah mixture. Is this one seah considered to be terumah?

Mishnah Five
A seah of terumah that fell into a hundred [of hullin], and he lifted it out and fell into [hullin] elsewhere:
Rabbi Eliezer says: it renders medumma as though it were certainly terumah.   
But the sages say: it is rendered medumma only according to proportion.  

Explanation
Section one: According to Rabbi Eliezer, when a seah of terumah falls into one hundred seahs of hullin and then one seah is taken out to be given to a priest, the seah that is taken out is considered to be the same seah of terumah that fell in. Therefore, if the seah that is taken out falls into another pile of hullin, it again will cause the entire pile to be medumma, doubtful terumah. If the pile does not have 100 seahs of hullin, then the entire pile is forbidden to non-priests and it must be sold to a priest at the price of terumah. The main point is that the seah taken out has the same status as that which fell inâ€”it is terumah.
Section two: The other sages hold that the seah taken out of the original pile into which it fell is considered to be 1/101 terumah. If that seah falls into another pile, then as long as the amount of terumah is less than 1/100 of the second pile into which it falls (which it almost certainly will be), then 1/101 of a seah can be taken out, given to the priest and the rest remains hullin.
