Terumot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah teaches that when one makes repayment for having accidentally eaten terumah, there are certain things that he cannot use for repayment. 

Mishnah Five
They may not make repayment from gleanings, from forgotten sheaf, from peah or ownerless property.
Nor from first tithe from which terumah has been taken, nor from second tithe or dedicated produce which have been redeemed, because one dedicated thing (kadosh) cannot be used to redeem another dedicated thing (kadosh), the words of Rabbi Meir.
But the sages permit [payment] with these. 

Explanation
Section one: None of the things listed in this section were ever liable to have terumah separated from them (see above chapter one, mishnah five). Hence, one cannot use them to repay terumah that one accidentally ate.
Section two: Tithe from which terumah has been removed, and second tithe and dedicated produce which were redeemed (meaning they were exchanged for money) are all things that used to be holy (kadosh) and are now no longer kadosh. According to Rabbi Meir one cannot use something that was kadosh, even if it is no longer kadosh, to redeem another thing that is kadosh. This is true even though these things were once liable to have terumah taken from them because they came from produce that was initially liable for terumah.
Section three: The sages allow one to use the things in section two because they come from produce that was originally liable for terumah, unlike the list in section one that was never liable.
