Terumot, Chapter Four, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
Our mishnah is a continuation of Rabbi Akiva’s statement from yesterday’s mishnah.

Mishnah Nine 
How so?  If there were fifty black figs and fifty white fig, and a black fig fell in, the black figs are forbidden, but the white figs are permitted; and if a white fig fell in them, the white figs are forbidden and the black figs are permitted. 
If it is known which kind fell in, then each kind helps to bring up the other. 
In this case, Rabbi Eliezer is stringent and Rabbi Joshua is lenient.

Explanation
Section one: In yesterday’s mishnah Rabbi Akiva stated that if they knew which type of fig fell in, then only similar figs can help in counting towards the 100 to 1 ratio. So if we know what color fig fell in, then all of the figs of the same color are forbidden because they are “medumma” (doubtful terumah). But the other color figs are fine because we know that they didn’t fall in. 
Section two: If they don’t know which color fig fell in, then all the figs are potentially the terumah fig, and as long as there is a 100-1 ratio, one fig can be removed and the rest remains hullin, as we stated in yesterday’s mishnah.
Section three: Rabbi Eliezer was strict in this case, and Rabbi Joshua was lenient in this case (there opinions are found in yesterday’s mishnah). In tomorrow’s mishnah we will see an opposite case, one where Rabbi Eliezer is more lenient than Rabbi Joshua.
