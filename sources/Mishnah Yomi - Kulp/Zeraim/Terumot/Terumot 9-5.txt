Terumot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Five

Introduction 
Our mishnah and the following mishnah distinguish between two types of plants: those whose seeds disintegrate in the soil and those whose seeds do not.

Mishnah Five
If a hundred rows were planted with terumah seeds and one with hullin, they all are permitted, if they are of a kind whose seed disintegrates in the soil. 
But if they are of a kind whose seed does not disintegrate in the soil, then even if there be a hundred [rows] of hullin and one of terumah, they all are prohibited.

Explanation
Section one: If the seed of the plant disintegrates in the soil then the rabbis were especially lenient and allowed one to treat as hullin a case where 100 rows were planted with terumah and one with hullin. Meaning a mixture is permitted even if only a very small percentage is grown from hullin. This leniency is possible because the plants that grow from terumah seeds are not terumah “deoraita”—from Torah law.
Section two: This is the flipside to the previous section. If it is a type of plant whose seed does not disintegrate, then even if there are one hundred rows of hullin and one of terumah, they all must be treated as terumah. This is because the rule that terumah is nullified in a 100-1 ratio does not apply when the terumah is still attached to the ground.
