Terumot, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Twelve

Mishnah Twelve
If an egg is boiled with forbidden spices even its yolk is forbidden, because it absorbs.   
The water in which terumah has been stewed or pickled is forbidden to non-priests. 

Explanation
Section one: Even the yoke of an egg will take on the taste of the terumah spices with which it is cooked. The whole egg becomes prohibited to non-priests.
Section two: The water in which terumah is stewed or pickled takes on the taste of the terumah vegetables and it too becomes prohibited to non-priests.
