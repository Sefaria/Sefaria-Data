Terumot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Two

Introduction
When an Israelite woman is married to a priest, she can eat terumah. Our mishnah deals with a woman who ate terumah before she was married to a priest and then was married to a priest.

Mishnah Two
A daughter of an Israelite ate terumah and afterwards married a priest:  
If the terumah she ate had not yet been acquired by another priest she can repay to herself the value and the fifth.
But if a priest had already acquired the terumah she had eaten, she must repay the value to the owners, but [she can repay] the fifth to herself, because they said that he who eats terumah unwittingly, pays the value to the owners and the fifth to whoever he wants.

Explanation
Section one: If she ate the terumah before she had given it to a priest and then she was married to a priest she can just give the repayment and the one-fifth to herself. Note that she still has to give it to herself, because as we explained in yesterdayâ€™s mishnah, there is an element of atonement in paying back the terumah and the added one-fifth. Even if no restitution must be made, the amounts must be given for atonement to be effected.
Section two: But if a priest had already acquired the terumah before she ate it, then she has taken away from a priest and she must make restitution to him. The mishnah rules that she has to pay back only the principle, the exact amount that she took. The extra fifth she can pay back to whomever she wants and therefore she can pay back to herself.
