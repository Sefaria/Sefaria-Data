Terumot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Three

Introduction
In our mishnah a person begins to eat untithed grapes while he is still in the field, which is permitted. After beginning to eat the grapes they become liable for tithes. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua again disagree as to whether he may finish eating.

Mishnah Three 
If he was eating a bunch of grapes, and he entered from the garden into the courtyard:
Rabbi Eliezer says: he may finish eating.
But Rabbi Joshua says: he may not finish.   
If dusk set in at the eve of Shabbat:   
Rabbi Eliezer says: he may finish eating. 
But Rabbi Joshua says: he may not finish.  

Explanation
Section one: While still out in the garden, one may eat produce without tithing it, as long as he is eating it in an “ad hoc” fashion, meaning he is not making a meal out of it. However, once he brings the grapes into the courtyard he cannot eat them until they have been tithed. 
Rabbi Eliezer says that since he began to eat the grapes with permission, he may finish doing so without tithing them. Rabbi Joshua says he cannot finish them until he tithes.
Section two: When Shabbat begins one cannot eat untithed food, even in an ad hoc fashion out in the garden. In essence, all eating on Shabbat is considered formal and therefore food cannot be eaten untithed. If he begins eating it before Shabbat, Rabbi Eliezer says he may continue, whereas Rabbi Joshua again says that he may not.
