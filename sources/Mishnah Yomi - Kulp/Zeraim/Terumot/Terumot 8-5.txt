Terumot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Our mishnah continues to deal with the issue of uncovered water that might have poison in it.

Mishnah Five 
The amount of water that is uncovered:  enough to negate the poison. 
Rabbi Joshua says: in vessels [it is forbidden] whatever the quantity, but for water on the ground, it must be forty se'ahs. 

Explanation
Section one: There are two explanations to this section. The first explanation is that if there is enough water to negate the effects of the poison, then even uncovered water is permitted. 
The second explanation is oppositeâ€”if there is enough water so that one cannot taste the poison, then it is prohibited. If there is not that much water it is assumed that the poison would have taste, and therefore it is permitted.
Section two: According to the first interpretation, Rabbi Judah says that if the water is in vessels, even if there is a lot of water, it is prohibited. The vessels concentrate the solution, making the poison more potent. 
According to the second interpretation, we would have to say that even if there is little water, it is prohibited. Perhaps the vessels would mask the taste. 
However, if the water is on the ground, the standard measure is forty seahs. According to the first interpretation, more than that is permitted, assuming that the poison is nullified. The second interpretation would seem to have some difficulty in interpreting this line.
