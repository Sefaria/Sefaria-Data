Terumot, Chapter Three, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a person who intends to say one thing but instead says another. Is there any validity to either his words or to his intent?

Mishnah Eight
He who intends saying ‘terumah’ and says ‘tithe’, or ‘tithe’ and says ‘terumah’; 
‘Burnt-offering’ and he says ‘peace-offering’, or ‘peace-offering’ and he says ‘burnt-offering’; 
‘[I vow] that I will not enter this house,’ and says ‘that house’, 
‘That I will not derive any benefit from this [man],’ and says ‘from that [man],’ he has said nothing until his heart and mind are at one.

Explanation
This mishnah seems to be quite understandable, so I will keep it brief. 
In order for the person’s statement to have any validity, he must actually say what he intends to say. Therefore, if he intended to say that something would be terumah and he instead said that it would be tithe, that which he separated is neither tithe nor terumah. The same is true for all of the other examples in the mishnah.
