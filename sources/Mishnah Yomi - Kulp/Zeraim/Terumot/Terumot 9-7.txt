Terumot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
He who weeds allium plants (whose seeds do not disintegrate) for a Gentile, even though the produce is untithed he eat from them in a casual fashion.   
Saplings of terumah which had become unclean and were re-planted, become clean from their uncleanness.
But they must not be eaten until the edible part [of the stalk] has been lopped off.   
Rabbi Judah says: he must [before eating] lop off a second time that which grew on the edible part.

Explanation
Section one: Allium are plants whose seed remains in the soil. The mishnah discusses a situation where a Jew is working in a field owned by a Gentile but they are in the land of Israel. The plants that grow in such a field must be tithed before a Jew eats them. If the Jew had planted this field with untithed allium plants, he would not be allowed to eat them from even in a casual fashion until he had tithed them. However, since the Jew is working in the Gentileâ€™s field and the Gentile planted them, the rabbis were lenient and allowed him to eat from them in a casual fashion before he had tithed them.
Section two: Saplings are parts of plants that are cut off and then replanted elsewhere to make them grow stronger. In this case the saplings were cut off and then became impure. By planting them again they lose their impurity because plants attached to the ground cannot be impure.
Section three: Nevertheless, when they replant them they must lop off the edible part of the plant because that part should not be eaten at all, even by priests. The rabbis were strict with regard to the edible parts and continued to treat them as impure terumah which cannot be eaten. The new fruit that grows back will be pure and can be eaten by priests.
Rabbi Judah rules more stringently and says that he must lop off twice before he can eat.
