Terumot, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Yesterday we learned that when one is cleaning out a storehouse of terumah wheat, one can clean it out in a normal fashion and he need not be worried about cleaning out every last grain of terumah. In todayâ€™s mishnah we learn that the same halakhah is true when one comes to clean up a spill of terumah oil.

Mishnah Seven
Similarly, if a jar of oil is upset, they do not need to force him to sit down and scoop it up [with his fingers], but he may deal with it as he would in a case of hullin.
