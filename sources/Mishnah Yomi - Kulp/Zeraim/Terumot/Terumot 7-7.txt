Terumot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah is a continuation of the previous two mishnayot.

Mishnah Seven
If he used one of these [baskets] as seed, he is exempt, and the second is treated as if it were terumah and subject to the law of hallah, the words of Rabbi Meir.
But Rabbi Yose exempts it. 
If another person uses the second as seed, then he is exempt. 
If one man uses both as seed, if it is of a kind whose seed disintegrates [in the ground] it is permissible, but if it is of the kind whose seed does not disintegrate it is prohibited.

Explanation
Section one: This section is basically the same situation as that in the previous two mishnayot, except instead of eating one of the two baskets, he uses it as seed. The dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yose is the same as weâ€™ve already seen twice.
Section two: The only difference between this section and the previous mishnah is that there is a special rule that applies to the use of terumah as seed. If the seed disintegrates in the ground, meaning that it is a species whose seed cannot be recognized in the new plants, then the new plants that grow from it are not considered to be terumah. If the seeds do not disintegrate, then the plants are treated as terumah and they are prohibited, provided one man planted the seeds from both baskets. In all other cases, the new plants would be permitted.
