Terumot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight 
If a seah of terumah fell into a hundred [of hullin], and before he could take it out, another fell in, the whole becomes forbidden.   
Rabbi Shimon permits it.  

Explanation
Once the second seah falls into the mixture, it is now 2/102 terumah, and that is more terumah than the required 1/101 (one seah of terumah falling into one hundred seahs of hullin). Therefore, the sages say that the whole pile is medumma and is forbidden to non-priests. What they are in essence saying is that until the seah is removed, the pile is treated like terumah.
Rabbi Shimon holds that as soon as the terumah falls into the 100 hullin, the terumah is neutralized and it is treated as if it no longer exists. Therefore, if another seah of terumah falls in, it is treated as if it fell into a pile of 100 seahs of hullin and it too is neutralized.
