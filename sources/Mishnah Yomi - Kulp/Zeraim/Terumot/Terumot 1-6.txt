Terumot, Chapter One, Mishnah Six

Introduction 
This mishnah is the foil to the first mishnah of the tractate, where we learned of five categories of people who may not give terumah and if they do, their terumah is not terumah. Today we learn of five categories of people who should not give terumah, but if they do, their terumah is valid.

Mishnah Six
Five may not give terumah, but if they do, their terumah is terumah. 
A mute person;
A drunken person;
One who is naked;
A blind person; 
Or one who has had a seminal emission.
They may not give terumah, but if they do their terumah is valid. 

Explanation
Section one: The mute person cannot recite a blessing, therefore he should not give terumah. However, he is assumed to be intelligent, and therefore if he does give terumah, it is valid.
Section two: One who is drunk will probably not know how to properly separate terumah, and therefore he shouldn’t do it. However, if he does, his terumah is valid.
Section three: A naked person cannot recite a blessing, therefore he shouldn’t give terumah. But if he did, the terumah is valid.
Section four: A blind person shouldn’t give terumah lest he doesn’t know what he is giving from. He may give from the bad produce to exempt the good—which is not a preferable way of giving terumah. However, unlike deaf-mutes who were considered to lack intelligence because they couldn’t communicate, blind people could communicate perfectly well, and therefore, if they did separate terumah, it is valid. 
Section five: One who has had a seminal emission cannot recite a blessing until he goes to the mikveh (Berachot 3:6). Therefore, he shouldn’t separate terumah, but if he does do so, it is valid.
