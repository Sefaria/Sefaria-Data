Orlah, Chapter One, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah deals with when a tree is considered to have been uprooted.

Mishnah Four
If a tree was uprooted and one root was left [in the ground], it is exempt.  
How much must the [thickness of the] root be?   
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said in the name of Rabb Eliezer ben Judah a man of Bartota:  as [thick as] a pin [used for] stretching.

Explanation
Section one: As long as one root is still attached to the ground, the tree is considered to still be planted and, if the tree is older than three years, it is exempt from the rules of orlah.
Section two: In order for the root to count as still attaching the tree to ground, it must be as thick as a pin that weavers used for stretching the cloth. Others explain that this is a pin used by launderers. In any case, if the root is thinner than that, it would not be sufficient to nourish the tree, so we would have to consider the tree as having been detached and then replanted, which means that for the next three years its fruit will be prohibited.
