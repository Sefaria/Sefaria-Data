Orlah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Twelve

Introduction
In this mishnah, a man by the name of Yoezer provides testimony that Rabban Gamaliel the elder, a sage who lived while the Temple still stood, agreed with the sages’ opinion in yesterday’s mishnah, that forbidden leaven never causes dough to become prohibited unless there is enough forbidden leaven to cause fermentation. 
There are two descriptions of Yoezer provided in this mishnah. First of all, he is “Ish Habirah” which according to one opinion in the Talmud, means that he was “master of the Temple”, since Birah is a name of the entire Temple. Other commentators say that Birah is located near the Temple, but is not actually the Temple itself, while others say that it is a place within the Temple. 
The second fact is that Yoezer is a student of Bet Shammai. This is the second time in our chapter where a mishnah has stated that a student of Bet Shammai agrees with the sages of the previous mishnah, who can surely be identified with Bet Hillel. Accordingly, Rabbi Eliezer who argued with the sages in the previous mishnah, can be identified as holding a Shammaite position, albeit one that Yoezer seems to dispute. Thus, although we don’t get any new halakhic information in this mishnah, we do learn some valuable historical information about a halakhic battle going on within the House of Shammai. The Mishnah, which is a product of Bet Hillel, considers it worthwhile to let us know that sometimes those of the House of Shammai actually agree with Bet Hillel.
The mishnah itself contains the same halakhah as that found in yesterday’s mishnah, so for more information, look there. 
 
Mishnah Twelve
Yoezer, master of the temple (Ish Habirah), was one of the disciples of Bet Shammai and he said: I asked Rabban Gamaliel the elder as he was standing at the eastern gate [of the Temple], and he said: it never causes the dough to become prohibited unless there is enough to cause fermentation.
