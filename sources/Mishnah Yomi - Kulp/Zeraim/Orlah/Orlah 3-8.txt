Orlah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah provides an exception to the rule in yesterday’s mishnah.

Mishnah Eight
If the nuts cracked, or if the pomegranates burst open, or the casks became unstopped, or the pumpkins were cut, or the loaves were broken up, they become neutralized in two-hundred-and-one. 

Explanation
In yesterday’s mishnah we learned that certain items can not be neutralized in a mixture of two hundred. Here we learn that this is true only if they are whole. This is because they are “important items” only when they are whole. If they are in some way broken up, then they lose their importance and they will be neutralized in a mixture of 200 and one, as is the usual rule when it comes to orlah and kilayim.
