Orlah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Eleven

Introduction
Todayâ€™s mishnah discusses leaven of hullin and terumah that fall into dough and neither is sufficient to cause fermentation alone, but together they do cause fermentation.

Mishnah Eleven
Leaven of hullin and of terumah fell into dough, and neither this was sufficient to cause fermentation nor was that sufficient to cause fermentation, but together they caused [the dough] to ferment:
Rabbi Eliezer says: I go after the last.
But the sages say: whether the prohibited fell in first or last, it never causes the dough to become prohibited unless there is enough to cause fermentation.

Explanation
Section one: According to Rabbi Eliezer, whatever is the last to fall in is determinative because that is the leaven that causes the dough to ferment. If terumah leaven falls in first, and then hullin leaven, the dough is permitted because the hullin leaven is what caused fermentation. If the terumah leaven fell in last, then the dough is prohibited because it was forbidden leaven that caused fermentation.
Section two: The sages are more lenient, and rule that the dough is permitted unless the forbidden leaven is sufficient to cause fermentation alone. If fermentation depends on the hullin leaven, then the dough is permitted.
