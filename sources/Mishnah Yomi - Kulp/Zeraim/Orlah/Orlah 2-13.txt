Orlah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Thirteen

Introduction
This mishnah is not related to the chapter’s main topic, mixtures of forbidden and permitted produce. Rather the same phrase that appears in mishnah eleven, where Rabbi Eliezer says “I go after the first,” appears here.
The mishnah deals with vessels, such as shoes or other leather clothes, which were oiled with unclean and then clean oil, or vice versa. 

Mishnah Thirteen
Vessels which were oiled with unclean oil, and [later] he returned and oiled them with clean oil;
Or he [first] oiled them with clean oil, and [later] he returned [to them] and oiled them with unclean oil:
Rabbi Eliezer says: “I go after the first.”  
And the sages say: after the last.

Explanation
Section one: The vessels, which in this mishnah refers to clothing, were first oiled with unclean oil in order to soften them. When the unclean oil dried up, they were immersed in a mikveh in order to purify them. Then they were oiled again with clean oil.
Section two: Alternatively, they were first oiled with clean oil and then with unclean oil. 
Section three: Rabbi Eliezer says that the purity of the clothing goes after the first oiling. When the clothes expel the oil that they have soaked up, they will, according to Rabbi Eliezer, expel the first oil that they absorbed. So if the first oil was impure, then the clothes are impure.
Section four: The rabbis hold that the first oil is absorbed by the clothing and when used the objects will expel the last oil used.  Therefore, their purity goes after the first oiling.
