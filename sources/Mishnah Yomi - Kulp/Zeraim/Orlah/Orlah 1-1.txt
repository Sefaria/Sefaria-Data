Orlah, Chapter One, Mishnah One

Introduction
Our mishnah teaches that if a fruit tree is planted for a reason other than to provide fruit, it is exempt from the laws of orlah and its fruit may be eaten within the first three years of growth. This law is a great example of the strong role intent, in Hebrew, kavvanah, plays in rabbinic law. The intent of the person planting the tree is what determines the status of its fruit, and not the mere physicality of whether the tree is three years or older.

Mishnah One
One who plants [a fruit tree] as a fence or to provide wood beams, it is exempt from [the law of] orlah.  
Rabbi Yose says: even if he said “The inward [facing part of the tree] is for food, and the outward [facing part] is for a fence,” the inward [facing part] is subject [to orlah], and the outward [facing part] is exempt. 

Explanation
Section one: As stated in the introduction, if the tree was planted for another reason other than for its fruit, its fruit is permitted immediately, without having to wait three years. This law also stems (no pun intended) from Leviticus 19:23, which begins, “When you enter the land and plant any tree for food...” The tree is subject to the laws of orlah only if it is planted for food.
Section two: Rabbi Yose says that one can divide a tree into two parts. If the inward part, the part facing the field, was planted for food and the outer part was planted to serve as a fence to his field, he can eat the fruit of the outside part without waiting three years. But the laws of orlah do apply to the inside part.
