Orlah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with seasonings and when they prohibit a dish into which they fell.

Mishnah Ten
Seasonings [consisting] of two or three categories of one species, or [consisting] of three species [of one category], are forbidden and combine.   
Rabbi Shimon said: Two or three categories of one species, or two species of one category, do not combine. 

Explanation
Section one: If two or three categories of one type of seasoning, for instance pepper from terumah, kilayim and orlah, fall into a dish, they combine to forbid the dish if they impart taste. The same is true if there are three different species, for instance, pepper, onion and garlic of one category such as terumah. If together they impart flavor, then the dish is prohibited.
Section two: Rabbi Shimon disagrees and says that different categories of one species and different species of one category do not combine.
