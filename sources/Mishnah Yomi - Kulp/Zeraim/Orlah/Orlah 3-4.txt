Orlah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a cooked dish that was heated up by burning shells from orlah nuts or peels from orlah fruit.

Mishnah Four
A dish which one cooked with shells of orlah must be burned.
If [the dish] became mixed up with other [dishes], it becomes neutralized in two-hundred-and-one.  

Explanation
Section one: Just as the garment that was dyed with orlah dye must be burned (mishnah one), so too must the dish that was heated up and cooked with orlah kindling. Although this prohibited benefit did not get into the dish, since the dish was cooked with it, it is forbidden. 
Section two: If the dish became mixed up with other dishes, then if there are 200 dishes not cooked using orlah kindling for every one cooked using orlah kindling, then the orlah is neutralized. If there is less than such a ratio, then all of the dishes must be burned. 
Note that in this case, unlike that in mishnah one concerning the garment dyed with orlah dyes, Rabbi Meir agrees that the orlah can be neutralized. This is because a cooked dish or a loaf of bread (see mishnah five below) are not important items, whereas the garment was. Important items cannot, according to Rabbi Meir, be neutralized.
