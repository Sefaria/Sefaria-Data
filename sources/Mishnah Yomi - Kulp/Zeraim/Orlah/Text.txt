   	mishnah  . If one wove the whole of a sit's length of the wool of a firstling  into a garment, the garment shall be burnt;  and [if one wove a sit] of the hair of a nazirite   or of the first-born of an ass   into sack-cloth, the sack-cloth shall be burnt,   and [if one has woven] with [some wool or hair of] consecrated [animals],   these [kinds of wool or hair] have the effect of rendering [the woven article] consecrated, whatever [small amount] of them   there be.  

   	mishnah  . A dish which one cooked with shells   of ‘orlah   shall be burnt;   if it [such cooked food] became mixed up with other [cooked foods], it becomes neutralized in two-hundred-and-one.  

   	mishnah  . If one fired an oven with shells of ‘orlah, and baked therein bread, the bread shall be burnt. If it became mixed up with other [loaves] it becomes neutralized in two-hundred-and-one.  

   	mishnah  . If one has bundles of trefoil   of ‘mixed-seeds’ of the vineyard, they shall be burnt; if they became mixed up with others,   all of them shall be burnt. This is the opinion of r. Meir; but the sages say they become neutralized in two-hundred-and-one.  

   	mishnah  . Because r. Meir used to say: [the admixture of] anything whatsoever one is wont to count [when selling],   condemns to forfeiture;   but the sages say only six things condemn to forfeiture, and r. Akiba says seven [things], and these are they: nuts with brittle shells,   and pomegranates of badan,   and stopped-up casks,   and shoots of beet, and cabbage-heads, and greek pumpkins. R. Akiba   says: also loaves of a householder.   Such [of these] as are liable to ‘orlah   [condemn the mixture to forfeiture] as orlah, [such of these as are liable to the law of] ‘mixed-seeds’ of the vineyard   [condemn the mixture to forfeiture as] ‘mixed-seeds’ of the vineyard.

Mishnah  . In what [defined] manner   [may the above become neutralized]? If the nuts cracked, or if the pomegranates burst open, or the casks became unstopped, or the pumpkins were cut, or the loaves were broken up, they become neutralized in two-hundred-and-one.  

   	mishnah  . [whatever is under doubt] as to [whether it is] ‘orlah   is, in the land of israel, prohibited,   and in syria — permitted;   [and] outside the land   one may go down and purchase [from a non-israelite],   provided only that one has not seen him gathering it.   If [there is] a vineyard planted with greens, and greens are sold outside thereof,   these are, in the land of israel, prohibited,   and in syria — permitted;   outside the land   one may [purchase them from a non-israelite whom one has seen] go down and gather [‘mixed-seeds’ of the vineyard], provided only that one does not gather [them] with [one's own] hand.   ‘new [produce]’   is prohibited by the torah in all places;   and ‘orlah is a halachah;   and ‘mixed-seeds’   is one of the enactments of the scribes
