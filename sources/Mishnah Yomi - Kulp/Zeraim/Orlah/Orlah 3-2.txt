Orlah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with a single thread that was dyed with orlah dye and then woven into a garment. The length of this thread is the length of a sit which is explained by some to mean the distance between one’s thumb and forefinger, while others explain it to be the distance between one’s forefinger and middle finger when they are as spread apart as possible. 

Mishnah Two
If one dyed a thread the whole [length] of a sit with orlah peels, and wove it into a garment, and it is not known which [thread] it is: 
Rabbi Meir says: the garment must be burned;  
But the sages say: it becomes neutralized in two-hundred-and-one. 

Explanation
According to Rabbi Meir, if one thread dyed with shells or peels of orlah becomes woven into a garment and it is not known which thread it was, the entire garment must be burned, even if there is a 200-1 ratio of permitted to prohibited threads. To Rabbi Meir even such a small thread is still considered an “important item” and therefore it doesn’t become nullified in any ratio. 
The sages say that the prohibited thread is nullified in a ratio of 200-1, as they said with regard to an entire garment dyed with orlah thread in yesterday’s mishnah.
