Orlah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Sixteen

Introduction
Our mishnah contains yet another dispute between the sages and Rabbi Shimon over whether prohibited substances can join together to create a prohibition. 

Mishnah Sixteen
A piece of [meat from] one of the most holy [sacrifices] and [a piece] of [meat which is] piggul, or remnant, which were cooked with other pieces, it [the non-sacred meat] is prohibited to non-priests but permitted to priests.   
Rabbi Shimon declares it permitted to non-priests and to priests. 

Explanation
Section one: There are three categories of meat in this section: 1) most holy sacrifices; 2) piggul, which is a sacrifice that was offered by a priest with the intent to eat it in either the wrong place or the wrong time; 3) remnant—a sacrifice left over beyond the time frame in which it can be eaten. The first category can be eaten by priests but not non-priests, whereas the second and third categories are prohibited to all. In the situation described here a small piece of each of these categories of meat was cooked in a dish with hullin (non-sacred) meat. The hullin meat would be sufficient in quantity to nullify each piece of meat individually, but not if all three combine together. According to the first opinion, the three categories of prohibited meat combine together to forbid the hullin to non-priests, who can’t eat any of them. They do not combine to prohibit the dish to priests because priests can eat the sacrificial meat.
Section two: Rabbi Shimon is consistent with his opinion in the previous mishnayot where he said that different categories of forbidden food to not combine together to render hullin prohibited. This dish would be permitted to both priests and non-priests.
