Orlah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah is similar to the previous mishnah, but it talks about orlah and kilayim, instead of orlah and terumah.

Mishnah Three
Orlah can void kilayim, and kilayim [can void] orlah, and orlah [can void] orlah.   
How so? A seah of orlah falls into two hundred [seahs] and afterwards there falls in a seah and a little bit more of orlah, or a seah and a little bit more of kilayim of the vineyard--this is [a case] where orlah can void kilayim, and kilayim [can void] orlah, and orlah [can void] orlah. 

Explanation
Section one: Orlah can be combined with hullin to nullify kilayim and likewise, kilayim can join with hullin to nullify orlah, and there is even a case where orlah can combine with hullin to void other orlah. 
Section two: As in yesterday’s mishnah, we get an illustration of the aforementioned principle. First, a seah of orlah falls into two hundred seahs of hullin and then becomes void. There are now 201 seahs of hullin in the mixture. If afterwards a seah and a little bit more (1/200th of seah) of orlah fall in, the 201 seahs can nullify the one and 1/200 seahs of orlah that subsequently fall in, even though the 201 seahs is actually 200 seahs of hullin and one seah of orlah. The original seah that fell in counts when it comes to voiding the subsequent seah and a little bit more. 
The same would be true if a seah and a little bit more of mixed seeds of a vineyard fell in—the original seah of orlah counts when it comes to nullifying the subsequent seah and 1/200 of kilayim.
