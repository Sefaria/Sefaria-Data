Orlah, Chapter One, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Our mishnah continues to deal with what parts of the grape or fruit are subject to the laws of orlah, the asherah (idol-tree), the nazirite prohibitions and fourth-year vineyards.

Mishnah Eight
Defective grapes, grape kernels, grape husks, and the temed drink made from them, the peel of a pomegranate and its sprout, nutshells, and fruit-seeds, are all subject to the laws of orlah, asherah and a nazirite, but permitted in respect of a fourth year vineyard.   
Fallen unripe fruit is subject to all of them.

Explanation
Section one: All of the parts of grapes, fruits and nuts are subject to the laws of orlah, so that one could not use them during the first three years of growth. They are also prohibited if they grow from an asherah tree, for as we learned in yesterday’s mishnah, all parts of the asherah tree are prohibited. Finally, they are prohibited to a nazirite because Numbers 6:3-4 states, “no vinegar of (new) wine or vinegar of old wine, nor shall he drink any liquor of grapes…from the kernels even to the husk she shall not eat.”
However, the rules of the fourth year vineyard, which must be taken to Jerusalem and eaten there, do not apply to these parts of the grape or fruit, because the laws of maaser sheni and the fourth year vineyard (which are always the same) apply only to the parts of the plant that are normally eaten.
Section two: Fallen unripe fruit is subject to all of these prohibitions because it is food, even though it is not yet ready to be eaten.
