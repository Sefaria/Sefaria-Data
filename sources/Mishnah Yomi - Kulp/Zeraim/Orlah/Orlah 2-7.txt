Orlah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Seven

Introduction 
Our mishnah illustrates the second principle in yesterday’s mishnah, that when there are different species mixed together, one permitted and one prohibited, sometimes we rule leniently and sometimes we rule stringently.

Mishnah Seven
[We rule sometimes] leniently and [sometimes] stringently, [in the case of] a species [mixed] with a different kind of species. 
How so? 
If crushed beans were boiled together with lentils, and there is enough of them [the crushed beans] to impart flavor, [then] whether there is enough to become neutralized in one-hundred-and-one, or there is not enough to become neutralized in one-hundred-and-one, it is prohibited.
[But] if there is not enough to impart flavor, [then] whether there is enough to become neutralized in one-hundred-and-one, or there is not enough to become neutralized in one-hundred-and-one, [the mixture] is permitted.  

Explanation
Section one: This is the rule that was stated in yesterday’s mishnah.
Section two: This section illustrates the stringency. Crushed beans and lentils are considered to be two different species. If crushed beans that are of terumah are boiled with hullin (non-sacred) lentils, and the crushed beans impart their flavor to the entire mixture, then it doesn’t matter how small a percentage of the entire mixture the crushed beans are, the entire mixture is prohibited.
Section three: However, if the crushed beans do not impart their flavor, then it doesn’t matter if there is not the usually required 100-1 ratio, the mixture is permitted. To summarize, when it comes to unlike species, the one question we need to ask is if the forbidden species imparts flavor to the permitted species. If it does, the entire mixture is prohibited, no matter the percentage; if it does not, the entire mixture is permitted.
