Orlah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah deals with threads that come from various prohibited sources and the consequences of their being woven into garments.

Mishnah Three
If one wove thread the whole [length] of a sit from [the wool of a] first-born animal into a garment, the garment must be burned.
[If from] the hair of a nazirite or of the first-born of a donkey into sack-cloth, the sack-cloth must be burned.
And if even the smallest amount [from wool or hair of] consecrated [animals], that which it is woven into] is consecrated.

Explanation
Section one: It is forbidden to shear wool from a first-born goat or sheep (see Deuteronomy 15:19), and it is forbidden to derive any benefit from wool that was shorn from such an animal. Any garment that has even a thread from a first-born animal must be burned.
Section two: Similarly, it is forbidden to derive benefit from the hair of a person who took a nazirite vow. At the end of the term of naziriteship the nazirite is supposed to shave his/her hair and then burn it (see Numbers 6:18). The first-born of a donkey must be redeemed with a sheep (Exodus 13:13) and until this donkey has been redeemed it is prohibited to derive any benefit from it. Hence, if one wove sack-cloth with a sitâ€™s length of the hair of a nazirite or of a first-born donkey that had not yet been redeemed, the sack-cloth must be burned.
Section three: The law regarding wool that comes from consecrated animals, such as animals that have been dedicated to the Temple or set aside to be sacrifices, is stricter. Even if the smallest amount of such wool is used in a garment, the entire garment must be treated as if it was consecrated. This garment cannot be used at all, however, it can be redeemed and therefore it does not necessarily have to be burned.
