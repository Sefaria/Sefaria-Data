Orlah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a situation in which two batches of leaven fall into doughâ€”one being hullin (non-sacred) and one being terumah or kilayim. 

Mishnah Eight
If leaven of hullin has fallen into dough, and there was enough of it to cause fermentation, and after that leaven of terumah fell in or leaven of kilayim of the vineyard, and there is enough to cause fermentation, [the dough] is prohibited.

Explanation
In this case, the first piece of leaven to fall into the dough was enough to ferment the entire dough. When the next piece of leaven falls in, and that dough is terumah or kilayim (both would seemingly cause the dough to be prohibited), we might have thought that since the dough could be fermented even without the terumah or kilayim, the dough would be permitted. The mishnah rules that the dough is prohibited even though the prohibited leaven was not needed. The second batch of leaven, although not needed, still sped up the leavening process and therefore it causes the dough to be prohibited.
