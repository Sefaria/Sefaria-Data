Orlah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah is nearly identical to mishnah four, except it deals with bread baked in an oven lit with shells of orlah nuts (or peels of orlah fruit). Like the cooked dish in mishnah four, this bread cannot be eaten and must be burned. If it becomes mixed up with other permitted loaves of bread, it can be neutralized in a 200-1 ratio. 
 
Mishnah Five
An oven that was lit with shells of orlah, and then one baked bread in it, the bread must be burned. 
If it became mixed up with other [loaves] it becomes neutralized in two-hundred-and-one.
