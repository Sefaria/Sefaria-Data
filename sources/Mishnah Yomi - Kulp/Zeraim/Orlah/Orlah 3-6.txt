Orlah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Six

Introduction
In this mishnah we see another case in which Rabbi Meir says that when one prohibited item becomes mixed in with other items they all must be burned, whereas the other rabbis say that the prohibited item is neutralized in a ratio of 200-1.

Mishnah Six
If one has bundles of fenugreek of kilayim of the vineyard, they must be burned. 
If they became mixed up with others, all of them must be burned, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
But the sages say they become neutralized in two-hundred-and-one.  

Explanation
Section one: If one grows fenugreek in a vineyard it is prohibited to derive any benefit from the fenugreek because this is a case of “kilayim” (mixed seeds) in a vineyard. The bundle of fenugreek must be burned.
Section two: If the bundle of kilayim fenugreek becomes mixed up with bundles of permitted fenugreek, Rabbi Meir says that they are all prohibited. According to Rabbi Meir, the fenugreek is considered an “important item” and therefore, no matter what the ratio of permitted fenugreek to prohibited fenugreek, they are all prohibited and they all must be burned.
Section three: The other rabbis again hold that the prohibited fenugreek is neutralized in a ratio of 200-1.
