Orlah, Chapter Three, Mishnah One

Introduction
The prohibition of orlah extends not only to eating fruit from an orlah tree, but to deriving any benefit from such fruit, or even from the peel of the fruit. The next several mishnayot deal with various objects that can become prohibited by making use of orlah.

Mishnah One
A garment dyed with peels of orlah [fruit] must be burned.
If it became mixed up with other [garments], all of them shall be burned, the words of Rabbi Meir.
But the sages say: it becomes neutralized in two-hundred-and-one.

Explanation
Section one: Dyes would occasionally be made from the peels of pomegranates or from the shells of various types of nuts. If a garment was dyed using dye made from orlah peels, the garment must be burned because it is forbidden to derive any benefit from it.
Section two: If a garment that had been dyed with peels of orlah fruit or shells from orlah nuts becomes mixed up with other garments that had been dyed with permitted dyes, then Rabbi Meir holds that all of the garments must be burned. As we shall see below in mishnah seven, Rabbi Meir holds that important objects are not nullified, as are food items which are nullified in ratios of 100-1 or 200-1, depending upon the prohibition. Since the garment is not nullified, it doesnâ€™t matter how many garments got mixed up with it, they all are prohibited.
Section three: The other rabbis hold that the same ratio that nullifies orlah fruit can also serve to nullify garments dyed with orlah dyes. Thus if there are 200 non-orlah garments, the orlah garment is nullified and they are all permitted.
