Orlah, Chapter One, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
This mishnah deals with planting things that come from an orlah tree which is orlah.
 
Mishnah Nine
Rabbi Yose says: one may plant a shoot of orlah;
But one may not plant a nut of orlah, because it is fruit.
And one may not graft early date berries of orlah.

Explanation
Section one: Since the laws of orlah do not apply to the branches or shoots of a tree, one may plant a shoot of orlah. If the laws of orlah did apply, it would be forbidden to derive any benefit from the shoot, including planting it to grow a tree. 
Section two: The laws of orlah do apply to the nuts of a tree, because they are considered to be fruit. Hence, one cannot plant a nut.
Section three: The laws of orlah also apply to the “early date berries”, which according to some commentators are early date-palm branches and according to others, are a certain type of date. In any case, these date berries count as fruit and hence cannot be used in grafting.
