Orlah, Chapter One, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah discusses whether a replanted tree counts as if it was newly planted, such that one would have to wait another three years before its produce could be eaten.

Mishnah Three
If a tree was uprooted and the hard soil together with it, or if a stream swept it away and the hard soil together with it, [then] if it could have lived it is exempt,   
But if [it could] not, it is subject.   
If the hard soil has been detached from its side, or if a ploughshare shook it, or if someone shook it, and one reset it with earth, [then] if it could have lived, it is exempt,
But if not, it is subject.

Explanation
Section one: The criterion throughout the mishnah for determining whether the tree is considered to be replanted is whether it could have lived from the amount of soil that was uprooted with it. The test would seem to be placing it in a pot—if there was enough soil still stuck to the roots of the tree that the tree could continue to live then it is exempt from the laws of orlah, meaning that this is not considered replanting. But if it could not live from this soil, then the clock is rewound and the fruit of next three years will be prohibited.
Section two: This same rule applies in situations where the tree lost some of its soil and then a person put more soil back there. If the tree could have lived off of the soil that was left attached to it, then putting new soil on it doesn’t count as replanting. But if it could not have lived off of this soil, then it does count as replanting.
