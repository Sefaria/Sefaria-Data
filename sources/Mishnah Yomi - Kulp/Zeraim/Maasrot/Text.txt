   	mishnah  . If a man makes pomace wine,   putting water on by measure, and he finds [afterwards] the same quantity, he is exempt from giving tithe.   R. Judah renders him liable.   If, however, he found more than the same quantity, he must give [tithe] for it from another place, in proportion.  

   	mishnah  . If ant-holes have remained the whole night near a pile of corn which was liable to tithe,   then these are also liable,   since it is obvious that they [the ants] have been dragging away the whole night from something [of which the work] had been completed.  
Mishnah  . Baalbek garlic,   rikpa   onions, cicilian beans and egyptians lentils (r. Meir includes also colocasia, and r. Jose says: also wild lentils)   are exempt from tithes   and may be brought from any man in the seventh year.   The higher seed-pods of the arum,   the seed of leeks, the seed of onions, the seed of turnips and radishes, and other seeds of garden produce which are not eaten, are exempt from tithes, and may be bought from any man in the seventh year;   and although the stock from which they grew was terumah, they may still be eaten [by non-priests]   .
