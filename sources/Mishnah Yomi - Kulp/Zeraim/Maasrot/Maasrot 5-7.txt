Maasrot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with grain found in anthills, and whether or not such grain must be tithed.

Mishnah Seven
Anthills which have remained the whole night near a pile of grain which was liable to tithe,   [the grain found in them] is liable, since it is obvious that they [the ants] have been dragging away the whole night from something [of which the work] had been completed.

Explanation
When grain is found in these anthills next to a pile of grain, and they had been that way all night, we can assume that the grain comes from the adjacent pile and that it must be tithed.
