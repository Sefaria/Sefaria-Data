Joseph the priest   brought first-ripe fruits [in the form] of wine and oil,   but they did not accept [these] from him;   he also brought up his sons and members of his household to celebrate the lesser passover   in jerusalem, but they turned him back,   so that the thing should not become firmly fixed as an obligation. Ariston   brought his first-ripe fruits from apamea   and they accepted [these] from him,   because they said,   one who owns [land] in syria is as one who owns [land] in the outskirts of jerusalem.
