Hallah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
Earth from outside the land has come to the land [of Israel] in a boat, [the produce grown in it] is subject to tithes and to the [law relating to] the seventh year.  
Rabbi Judah: when does this apply? When the boat touches [the ground].  
Dough which has been kneaded with fruit-juice is subject to hallah, and may be eaten with unclean hands.  

Explanation
Section one: In yesterday’s mishnah we learned that if grain from outside the land of Israel is brought into Israel, it becomes liable for hallah. Today’s mishnah teaches that if a boat comes close to the land of Israel and there is produce in the boat, the produce is liable for tithes and it is subject to the laws governing produce grown in the seventh year, just as if the produce was grown in Israel itself. 
Section two: Rabbi Judah says that this applies only if the boat is actually touching the ground. This is interpreted as meaning that the boat is ten handbreadths from the bottom of the sea. That makes it as if the earth on the boat is attached to the ground. But if the boat was floating high on the water, its produce is exempt from these laws.
Section three: Dough which is kneaded with fruit-juice instead of water is still liable for hallah. However, it cannot receive impurity because fruit-juice is not one of the seven liquids that makes produce susceptible to impurity. Therefore, the hallah separated from this dough can be eaten with unclean hands, without fear that the hallah will become impure and forbidden for consumption.
