Hallah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Two

Introduction
In the beginning of the tractate we learned that there are five species of grain: wheat, barley, rye, spelt and oats. Here we see that for the purpose of mixtures of different types of grain, these don’t all count as separate species. Rather, in most cases, these different species are reckoned together. This is probably because they look somewhat the same.
 
Mishnah Two
What counts as a species with its same species?  
Wheat is not reckoned together with any [species] other than with spelt; 
Barley is reckoned together with all [species] except wheat. 
Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: the rest of the species are reckoned together one with another.

Explanation
Section one: Wheat is a separate species and is not reckoned together with any other species, other than spelt. Thus if wheat and oat batches of dough come into contact, they do not join for the sake of making them subject to hallah.
Section two: Barley is reckoned with all four other species, except for wheat, which we learned above is only reckoned with spelt.
Section three: Finally, Rabbi Yohanan b. Nuri explains that with regard to spelt, rye and oats, they are all reckoned together.
We should note that overall the better the quality of grain, the less likely it is to join together with other species. Wheat is the “king of grains” and the best bread is made from wheat. Therefore, it is nearly exclusive, joining together only with spelt. Barley is less than wheat, and so it joins together with everything but wheat. Finally, the other grains are similar to barley and they too join together with all other grains, except for wheat.
