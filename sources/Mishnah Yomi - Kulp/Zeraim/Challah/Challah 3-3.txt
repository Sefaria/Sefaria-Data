Hallah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with differences between the rules that apply before she rolls the dough and those that apply afterwards.

Mishnah Three
[If] she dedicated her dough [to the Temple] before rolling it, and then redeemed it, it is subject [to hallah].
[If she dedicated it] after rolling it, and redeemed it, it is subject [to hallah].
[But if] she dedicated it before rolling it, and the Temple treasurer rolled it, and after that she redeemed it, it is exempt, since at the time of its obligation it was exempt.  

Explanation
Section one: Dough that has been dedicated to the Temple is exempt from hallah. This is true with regard to all of the agricultural gifts—one is exempt from giving them if the produce has already been dedicated to the Temple. However, in order for the dough to be exempt it has to belong to the Temple at the time it becomes liable for hallah, meaning when it is rolled.
Thus, if a woman dedicated her dough to the Temple before she rolled it and then redeemed it before she rolled it, it is subject to hallah because when she rolls it, it belongs to her again.
Section two: Similarly, if she dedicates the dough after it has been rolled and then she redeems it, it is liable for hallah, because she owned it at the time it became liable.
Section three: However, if she dedicates it before she rolls it, and then the Temple treasurer (or any other Temple agent) takes possession of it and rolls it, and then she redeems it, it is exempt because it belonged to the Temple when it became liable for hallah. While this may be a case that will never in actuality happen, what is important is that it teaches a principle—if it is in her possession when it becomes liable for hallah, she must separate the hallah.
