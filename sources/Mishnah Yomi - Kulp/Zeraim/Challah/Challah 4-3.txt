Hallah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with the topic of when separate batches of dough join together. The mishnah describes a situation in which there are three batches of dough in a row. The first batch and the third batch are subject to hallah but the middle batch, which is touching both the first and third batch, is exempt from hallah.  

Mishnah Three 
[If there are two doughs from] two [separate] kavs, and a kav of rice [dough] or a kav of terumah dough [lying] between, they are not reckoned together.
[If there was] dough from which hallah had already been taken [lying] between, they are reckoned together, since it had once been subject to hallah. 

Explanation
Section one: The fact that the middle batch of dough is exempt from hallah because it is made of rice, or because it is terumah dough which was never subject to hallah, means that it does not serve to join the two outside batches of dough. Since they are each less than the minimum measurement of 5/4 of a kav, they are exempt.
Section two: If, however, the middle batch of dough is exempt from hallah because its hallah has already been removed, then it does serve to connect the two outside batches of dough. This dough was once liable for hallah and it is therefore categorically subject to the laws of hallah, unlike the rice or terumah dough which were never subject to hallah.
