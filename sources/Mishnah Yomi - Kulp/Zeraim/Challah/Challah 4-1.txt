Hallah, Chapter Four, Mishnah One

Introduction 
Our mishnah discusses the difference between cases where two batches of dough from the same species come into contact and cases where two batches of dough from different species come into contact.

Mishnah One
Two women who made [separate doughs] from two [separate] kavs, and these [doughs] touched one another, even if they are of the same species, they are exempt [from hallah].
When they belong to one woman: 
If one species [comes into contact] with the same species, they are subject [to hallah].  
If different species, they are exempt. 

Explanation
Section one: In this case two women each make a batch of dough and this batch of dough is only a kav in volume, which means that the dough is not subject to hallah (5/4 of a kav is the minimum). If these two batches of dough come into contact with each other they are still not subject to hallah because they are owned by different women. This is true even if they are of the same species.
Section two: If the two batches of dough belong to the same woman, then if the two batches of dough are made from the same species, they are liable because they join together to create the minimum measure. If they are of different species then the two batches do not join together to form a minimum measure and they remain exempt from hallah.
