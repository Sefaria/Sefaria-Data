Hallah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Only dough owned by a Jew is subject to hallah, not dough owned by a Gentile. This mishnah teaches when the dough is considered to be owned by a Jew.

Mishnah Five
If a Gentile gave [flour] to an Israelite to make for him dough, it is exempt from hallah.   
If the Gentile gave it to him as a gift, before rolling it, he is liable.   
If after rolling it, he is exempt.   
If one makes dough together with a Gentile, then if there is not in [the portion] of the Israelite the minimum measure subject to hallah, it is exempt from hallah.

Explanation
Section one: Since this flour is owned by a Gentile, it is exempt from hallah, even though the Jew is the one who kneaded it.
Section two: If the Gentile gave the dough to the Jew as a gift, then it will depend on when he gave it to him. If he gave it to him before rolling it, then it is liable for hallah because a Jew owned it when it became liable for hallah. But if he gave it to him after he rolled it, then it is exempt from hallah, because a Gentile owned it when it became liable. 
Section three: If a Jew joins in a partnership with a Gentile to make dough, then the dough is liable for hallah if the Jewâ€™s portion is the minimum measure of 5/4 of a kav. If not, then the dough is exempt, even if there is together more than 5/4 of a kav.
