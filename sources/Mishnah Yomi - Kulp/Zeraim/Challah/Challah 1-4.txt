Hallah, Chapter One, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah is the opposite of yesterday’s mishnah. Today, the mishnah lists things that are, for various reasons, liable for tithes, but exempt from hallah.

Mishnah Four
The following are liable for tithes, but exempt from hallah: rice, millet, poppy-seed, sesame seeds, pulse, and less than five-fourths [of a kab] of [the five kinds of] grain, sponge-cakes, honey-cakes, dumplings, a cake [cooked] in a pan and medumma are exempt from hallah.

Explanation
Rice, millet, poppy-seed, sesame seeds, pulse: These are all liable for tithes but exempt from hallah because only the five grains are liable for hallah.
Less than five-quarters [of a kav] of [the five kinds of] grain: This small amount is not liable for hallah because it is too small of an amount. We shall return to this issue in a later chapter.
Sponge-cakes, honey-cakes, dumplings, a cake [cooked] in a pan: These are all exempt from hallah because they are not baked in an oven. Only things baked in an oven are liable for hallah.
Medumma: Medumma is a mixture of hullin and terumah in which there is not sufficient hullin to nullify the terumah (there are less than 100 parts hullin for each part terumah). This mixture is treated like terumah and can only be eaten by a priest. It is exempt from hallah because it already has terumah in it, and as we have seen hallah is called terumah by the Torah. The rabbis ruled that one doesn’t separate terumah/hallah from something that is already, even partially, terumah.
