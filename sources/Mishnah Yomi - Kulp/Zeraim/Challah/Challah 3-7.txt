Hallah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
One who makes dough from wheat [flour] and from rice [flour]—if it has a taste of grain, it is subject to hallah, and one can fulfill one’s obligation with it on Pesah.
But if it does not have the taste of grain, it is not subject to hallah, and one cannot fulfill with it one’s obligation on Pesah.

Explanation
Rice is not one of the five grains subject to the laws of hallah (see 1:1), nor can one use it as matzah on Pesah. Our mishnah teaches that if one mixes rice and one of the other five grains, such as wheat, he is liable for hallah if he can taste the wheat. If he makes it into matzah he can use it as matzah at the seder, as long as he can taste the wheat. 
He is obligated for hallah even if there is not enough wheat flour to constitute the minimum measure required for dough to be liable for hallah (5/4 of a kav). 
If he cannot taste the wheat then there is no need to separate hallah and it can’t be used as matzah on Pesah.
