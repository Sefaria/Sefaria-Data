Hallah, Chapter One, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah continues to discuss sponge-cakes, which we learned yesterday were not liable for hallah. Sponge-cakes were made from watery dough and they were cooked either just in the sun, or with a little heat in a pan over an open flame. Since they are not made like bread, they are exempt from hallah.

Mishnah Five 
Dough which was originally [intended for] sponge-cakes, and in the end is [cooked as] sponge-cake, is exempt from hallah.   
[If it was] originally [ordinary] dough, but in the end [cooked as] sponge-cakes, [or if it was] originally [intended for] sponge-cakes, but finally [cooked as ordinary] dough, it is subject to hallah.
Similarly, bread crumbs (kenuvkaot) are subject [to hallah]. 

Explanation
Section one: If the flour and water mixture was originally put together in order to be made into sponge-cakes and in the end it was cooked to be sponge-cakes in the way that sponge-cakes are cooked, then it is exempt from hallah.
Section two: However, if it was originally intended to be ordinary dough, dough whose consistency is thicker than that used for sponge-cakes, and then he cooked it in the way that one cooks sponge-cakes, in a pan or in water or with some other ingredients, then it is liable for hallah. So too, if it began as watery sponge-cake dough, and then he baked it in a regular oven, it is also liable for hallah. As long as it either began or ended up like regular dough, hallah must be taken out. 
Section three: Kenuvkaot come from bread and then are boiled in small pieces in a pan to be food for small children. They are liable for hallah because they began as bread, even though they were eventually cooked in a manner similar to sponge-cakes.
