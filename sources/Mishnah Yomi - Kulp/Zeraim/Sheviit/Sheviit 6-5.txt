Sheviit, Chapter Six, Mishnah Five

Introduction
There are certain cases in which halakhah demands that certain types of produce be destroyed. Our mishnah teaches that such produce must be destroyed in the land of Israel and cannot be brought outside of the land.

Mishnah Five 
One may not take oil [of terumah] that had to be burned, nor produce of the seventh year, from the land [of Israel] to other countries. 
Rabbi Shimon said: I have heard it expressly stated that they may be exported to Syria, but not to any other country outside the land.

Explanation
Section one: There are two items mentioned here. The first is terumah oil that has become impure. Such oil must be burned and one can derive no benefit from it. The second is sabbatical year produce after the time when it must be destroyed (we shall learn more about this in the next chapter). It is forbidden to export either of these two things because they must be destroyed in the land of Israel. It would seem to me that there may also have been a suspicion that a person might take them out of the land of Israel and not destroy them at all.
Section two: Rabbi Shimon says that he has heard a tradition whereby one can bring these things to Syria and destroy them there. Evidently in this matter Syria is treated as if it was part of the land of Israel. Compare this with mishnah two above.
