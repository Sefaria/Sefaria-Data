Sheviit, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Introduction 
This mishnah teaches some other exceptions to the general prohibitions of tending to a field in the sixth year of the sabbatical cycle.

Mishnah Two
They may manure and hoe cucumbers and gourds until Rosh Hashanah.   
So too with regard to irrigated fields. 
They may remove flaws from trees, strip off leaves, cover roots with earth, and fumigate the plants until Rosh Hashanah.   
Rabbi Shimon says: one may also remove leaves from a grape cluster even in the seventh year itself.  

Explanation
Section one:  Manuring and hoeing are not prohibited by the Torah in the sabbatical year. They are prohibited only derabanan, from rabbinic authority. Therefore, these activities are completely permitted up until Rosh Hashanah of the sabbatical year, when the law is more lenient.
Section two: Irrigated fields, fields which require artificial irrigation may be weeded all the way up until Rosh Hashanah of the sabbatical year. This is because the fruits of that year need the water and this is not preparation for the following year.
Section three: This section continues to list activities that are prohibited during the sabbatical year only “derabanan” and are therefore permitted during the sixth year.  
Another reason that these labors may be permitted is that they are not intended to prepare for the seventh year, but rather to improve the fruit already growing on the tree, the fruit of the sixth year.
Section four:  Rabbi Shimon adds another permitted activity, this time one that is permitted even on the seventh year itself.  Removing leaves from grape clusters does not improve the tree, which would be prohibited. Rather it only prevents damage to the cluster of grapes.  Therefore, it is allowed on the sabbatical year.
