Sheviit, Chapter One, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Our mishnah teaches that gourd plants, which also need to be plowed frequently, count as with the saplings.

Mishnah Seven 
Saplings and gourds are counted together within space of a bet seah. 
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: if there are ten gourds in the bet seah they may plow the whole bet seah until Rosh Hashanah.

Explanation
Section one: If there are a combination of ten saplings and gourd plants then they may plow the entire field.  There are two caveats which the Talmud adds. First of all, these must be large gourd plants, large enough to justify needing to plow large plots of land to take care of them.  Secondly, there must be more saplings then gourd plants, for instance six saplings and four gourds.
Section two:  According to Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, gourd plants are treated just like the saplings. Thus if there are ten gourd plants, the whole field may be plowed all the way up until Rosh Hashanah.
