Sheviit, Chapter Six, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah deals with onions that were harvested in the sixth year and then left stored in the ground until the seventh year. In the seventh year rain falls on them and they sprout new leaves. The question is: are these onions considered to be seventh year produce because their sprouts grew in the seventh year?

Mishnah Three
Onions on which rain fell and which had sprouted, if their leaves had turned black, they are forbidden; if they had become green they are permitted.   
Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: if they can be plucked out by their leaves, they are forbidden. 
In the year after the sabbatical year, the like of these are permitted.

Explanation
Section one:  If the leaves of the onions sprouted and turned black, which Albeck explains to mean that they turned dark green, then they are considered to be sabbatical year produce, and they must be treated as such.  However, if they become green and wilted (again, according to Albeck) then the sprouts do not count as if they grew from the land, but rather as if they grew from the onions. Hence, they are not treated as sabbatical year produce and they are permitted.
Section two: Rabbi Hanina says that the status of the onions depends on how strong the leaves are. If one can pull the onions out of the ground by the leaves, then the leaves are considered to have grown enough in the seventh year to prohibit the onions. But if one cannot pull the onions out by the leaves, then the leaves are insignificant and the onions are not prohibited.
Section three: The same rules will apply in the opposite manner with regard to onions that were grown in the seventh year and rain fell on them in the eighth year. If one can pull them up by their leaves, then the leaves are treated as eight year produce, but if not they are treated as seventh year produce and are forbidden.
