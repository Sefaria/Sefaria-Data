Sheviit, Chapter Three, Mishnah Five

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with quarrying stones during the sabbatical year. The problem is that this looks too much like clearing his field of stones in order to use it for growing. The mishnah gives a solution that avoids giving that appearance.

Mishnah Five
A man may not open a stone quarry within his field for the first time, unless there are in it three layers, each three [cubits long], three wide and three high, for a total of twenty-seven stones.

Explanation
First of all, it is forbidden to begin a quarry in the field on the sabbatical year. If he hadnâ€™t dug stones there previously, then he may not do so in the sabbatical year.
However, if there was already there a quarry, then he may use it because it will be clear that he is removing stones to use in building or for some other purpose and he is not clearing the field to use it for agriculture. The minimum measure of the previous quarry must be three layers, each layer being three cubits long, three wide and three high. This is the space that would allow twenty-seven one cubit stones to have been quarried.  I should note that this explanation is according to the Rambam, but there are other explanations of the mishnah.
