Sheviit, Chapter Four, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Fruits that grow on their own during the sabbatical year may be eaten. However, they must be fully ripe before they can be eaten. This halakhah is derived from a midrash on Leviticus 25:7 which states, “And the fruit of the field shall be for food.”  From here the rabbis derived that only when fruit has become “food” can one eat it, and not before.
Our mishnah defines how ripe a fig must be before it is eaten.

Mishnah Seven 
From when may one begin to eat of the fruit of the trees in the seventh year?   
With unripe figs as soon as they assume a rosy appearance, one may eat them in the field with his bread. Once they have begun to ripen, he may take them home. 
And similarly in the other years of the sabbatical cycle [when this latter stage has been reached] they are subject to tithes.

Explanation
Section one: When figs begin to ripen and to turn red, they may be eaten in the field with bread.  Since this is a normal way of eating them, they may be eaten this way during the sabbatical year. When they have more fully ripened, they may be taken home, again because this is the normal time to gather figs into one’s home. 
Section two:  Fruit is not liable to be tithed until it has ripened.  So figs are not liable to be tithed until they have ripened, the time when one would bring them into one’s home.  However, on the sabbatical year itself one need not tithe them at all because all produce is ownerless and ownerless produce need not be tithed. Thus there are no tithes during the sabbatical year.
