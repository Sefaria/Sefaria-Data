Sheviit, Chapter Six, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Our mishnah discusses when one can begin to trust that the vegetables he buys in eighth year, the year that follows the sabbatical year are not sabbatical year produce and therefore forbidden but rather actually are from the eighth year.

Mishnah Four
When may one buy vegetables at the outgoing of the sabbatical year [without fear that they are sabbatical produce]?   
When enough time has passed for similar [vegetables] to grow.   
Where produce ripens quickly, even that which is late in ripening is also permissible. 
Rabbi used to allow the buying of vegetables immediately after the sabbatical year was over.

Explanation
Section one: Once enough time has passed in the new year for similar vegetables to ripen, one can trust that a vegetable that he comes across in the market is from the eighth year and not the seventh year.
Section two:  Some vegetables grow quicker in some areas than in others. The mishnah is lenient and allows one who is in a place where the vegetables take longer to grow and have not yet ripened to buy a vegetable that may have come from a place where that vegetable has already ripened.  In other words, since the vegetable might have come from that place, we assume that it did.
Section three: There are two reasons that Rabbi [Judah Hanasi] may have been so lenient and allowed one to buy vegetables immediately. First of all, he may have held that vegetables ripen quickly. If so, then “immediately” must mean after a minimum of a few days. Alternatively, he may have permitted the vegetable under the assumption that it came from outside the land of Israel, and such produce is always permitted. If this is the correct interpretation then “immediately” can be taken literally.
