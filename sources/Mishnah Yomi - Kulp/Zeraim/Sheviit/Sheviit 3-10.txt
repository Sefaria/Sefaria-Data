Sheviit, Chapter Three, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
Normally speaking one is not allowed to dig a hole on his property during the sabbatical year because that is considered working the land.  Our mishnah deals with a few exceptions to this rule.
 
Mishnah Ten 
One who makes a fence between his own property and the public domain, he is allowed to dig down to rock level.   
What should he do with the soil? He piles it up in the public domain, and then restores it, the words of Rabbi Joshua. 
Rabbi Akiva says: just as no damage may be done to a public domain, so one may not repair it.  Then what should he do with the soil? He heaps it up in his own field in the manner of those who bring out dung [for manure].   
Similarly when one digs a cistern, a trench or a cave.

Explanation
Section one:  One is allowed to build a fence during the sabbatical year between his property and the public domain because people who see him will not suspect him of preparing his property for planting. He is allowed to dig all the way down to bedrock.
Section two: Were he to just heap the soil up in his own field it would look like he was tending to his field. Therefore, according to Rabbi Joshua he heaps it up in the public domain, and then afterwards he may use that soil to repair holes in the public domain.  
Section three: Rabbi Akiva points out that there is a problem with Rabbi Joshuaâ€™s solution as to what to do with the soil. One is not allowed to do any damage to the public domain, even if he will afterwards restore the damage he has done.  Heaping his soil in the public domain is forbidden, even if he is only doing so on a temporary basis.  Rather what he should do is heap it up in his own field using the same rules that we saw with regarding to the dung used for manure. He needs to make three dungheaps per bet seah.
Section four: The same debate between Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Akiva exists also with regard to digging a cistern, a trench or a cave.
