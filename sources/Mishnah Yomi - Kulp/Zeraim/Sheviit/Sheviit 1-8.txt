Sheviit, Chapter One, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
In the previous mishnah we learned that saplings may be plowed up until Rosh Hashanah.  Our mishnah defines up until what point a tree is a sapling—sort of like asking, when is the bar mitzvah for a tree?

Mishnah Eight
Up until when are they called saplings?   
Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says: until they are permitted for common use.  
But Rabbi Joshua says: until they are seven years old. 
Rabbi Akiba says: [the word] sapling, [it goes] according to its name.   
A tree which had been cut down and then produced fresh shoots: if one handbreadth or less, they are regarded as saplings, if more than a handbreadth they are regarded as trees, the words of Rabbi Shimon.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, the tree is considered a sapling as long as its fruit is forbidden to be used because it is “orlah.” The fruit of a tree cannot be eaten for the first three years of the tree’s life and in the fourth year it is sanctified and it must be brought to Jerusalem and eaten there. It doesn’t become permitted for common use until the fifth year. At that point the sapling becomes a tree, according to this opinion. Congratulations tree! We’re very proud of you.
Section two:  Rabbi Joshua says that the tree must be seven years old before it is no longer a sapling. The Tosefta explains that this refers to olive trees, which take longer to mature.  Fig-trees are saplings until they are six, whereas the grape vine is a sapling until it is five.
Section three: Rabbi Akiba says that it depends on how people refer to the tree/sapling.  If they call it a sapling, it doesn’t matter how old it is, it is still considered a sapling.  And if they call it a tree, it is no longer a sapling, no matter its age.
Section four:  If a tree has been cut down and starts to send out shoots again, it is in the category of “sapling” until the shoots are one handbreadth long. After that point, it reverts to being a tree.
