Sheviit, Chapter Five, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah deals with three types of plants that are customary to leave in the ground even after they have fully ripened. It is customary to uproot these plants with a rake and not by hand. The problem with the rake is that it might look like he is working the land, which is of course, forbidden on Sheviit.
Surprisingly, the first of these plants is my favorite and yours as well, the luf.

Mishnah Four
Luf of the sixth year that has entered the seventh year, similarly summer onions and puah (madder) grown in good soil:
Bet Shammai says: they must be uprooted with wooden rakes.   
Bet Hillel says: [even] with metal rakes.   
They agree in the case of puah with strong roots, that they may be uprooted with metal spades.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Bet Shammai, when one wishes to uproot these types of plants, he must do so with a type of instrument which differs from the one normally used.  This will show everyone that his intention is not to work the land but rather to just uproot the plants.
Section two: Bet Hillel disagrees and holds that he may do so with the normal metal rakes, the same way that he always does.
Section three: Bet Shammai agrees that if he wishes to uproot puah that has strong roots, and the wooden rake is not sufficient, that he may use the metal rake.
