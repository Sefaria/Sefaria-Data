Sheviit, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a person who has inherited or received as a gift seventh year produce after the time when that produce should have been removed. 

Mishnah Nine
If one had inherited seventh year produce or had received them as a gift: 
Rabbi Eliezer says: they must be given to anyone who eats them.   
But the sages say: the sinner must not benefit, rather it should be sold to anyone who eats it, and its price divided among everyone.   
If one eats dough of seventh year [produce] before the hallah was taken from it, he has incurred thereby the death penalty [at the hands of heaven].

Explanation 
Section one: According to Rabbi Eliezer he should give the seventh year produce away to those who will eat it, even though it is forbidden for them to do so. He shouldn’t sell it to them because then the sanctity of the produce would be transferred to the proceeds.
The other sages say that the problem with just giving it to such people is that they benefit by getting free produce. They are sinners because they eat sabbatical year produce—why should they benefit from their sins? Therefore, he should sell it to them and then divide the money among the poor. I should note that I have explained this mishnah according to Albeck—there are several other explanations.
Section two: The final section of this chapter teaches that one must separate “hallah” from dough made of seventh year produce. “Hallah” is separated from dough and given to the priest and any non-priest who eats from it is liable for death at the hands of heaven. Although tithes do not need to be taken from seventh year produce, hallah does. Therefore if one eats dough of sabbatical year produce before the hallah is removed, he is punished in the same way he would be if he had eaten dough before the hallah was removed in any other year.
