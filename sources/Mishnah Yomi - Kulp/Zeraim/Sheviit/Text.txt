Mishnah  . If one gathered fresh vegetables,   he may eat them until the [ground] moisture is dried up;   and if he gathered dry [vegetables] [he may eat them] until the second rainfall.   Leaves of reeds and of the vine   [may be eaten] until they fall from the stems; but if they have been gathered dry, they may be eaten only until the second rainfall. R. Akiba says: in all cases,   [they may be eaten] until the second rainfall.

   	Mishnah  . Similarly, if one hires to another a house ‘until the rainfall’, [he implies thereby] ‘until the second rainfall’; or if one had vowed not to derive any benefit from his fellow ‘until the rains’. [this likewise implies] ‘until the second rainfall’. Until when may the poor enter the gardens?   Until the second rainfall.   And when may one begin to enjoy or burn the straw and stubble of sabbatical produce?   After the second rainfall.  

   	Mishnah  . If one had sabbatical produce [at home] and the time of removal had come,   he may apportion food for three meals to every one.   R. Judah says: the poor   may eat thereof, even after the removal, but not the rich;   but r. Jose says: the poor and the rich alike may eat thereof.   [even after the time of] the removal.

   	Mishnah  .if one had inherited seventh year produce,   or had received them as a gift, r. Eliezer says: they must be given   unto all who wish to eat thereof.   But the sages say: the sinner must not benefit,   but the produce should be sold to those who would eat thereof,   and its price divided among them all.   If one eats of dough of the seventh year [produce] before the hallah   was taken from it, he has incurred thereby the death penalty.
