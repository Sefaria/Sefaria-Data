Sheviit, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
In this mishnah we hear of another instance in which some rabbis relate to Rabbi Akiva what Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva silences them.
 
Mishnah Ten
They also said in front of him: Rabbi Eliezer use to say: “Whoever eats bread [baked] by Samaritans is like one who eats the flesh of a pig.”   
He replied: Silence! I won’t tell you what Rabbi Eliezer actually said in this connection.

Explanation
Albeck explains that Rabbi Eliezer made such a strong statement against a person who eats Samaritan bread because he wished to warn Jews to keep away from the Samaritans. The Samaritans were a group whose holy city, Shechem, was found in the Shomron (Samaria). In some ways they would have acted like other Jews, but in many other ways they would have been different. As a group somewhat similar to the other Jews it is understandable why Rabbi Eliezer might have wished to keep them away.
Again, we don’t know why Rabbi Akiva silences the other rabbis.
