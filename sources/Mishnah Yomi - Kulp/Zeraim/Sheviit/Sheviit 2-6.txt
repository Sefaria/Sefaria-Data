Sheviit, Chapter Two, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah teaches that planting and grafting plants is prohibited some time before Rosh Hashanah. The sages debate exactly how much before Rosh Hashanah it is prohibited.

Mishnah Six
They may not plant or graft, or sink [vine-shoots] in the sixth year within thirty days of Rosh Hashanah. 
If he has planted or grafted, he must uproot. 
Rabbi Judah says: any grafting that has not taken root within three days will never do so. 
Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon say: two weeks.  

Explanation
Section one:  According to the first opinion, it is forbidden to plant or graft one plant on to another thirty days before Rosh Hashanah. Sinking vine shoots refers to the practice of putting a vine shoot into the ground in one place and bringing it up again another in order to start a new vine.  These activities are prohibited thirty days before Rosh Hashanah because it will take thirty days for the plant to strike roots, or to be successfully grafted.  
Section two:  If he does not observe this prohibition and he does plant, graft or sink a vine shoot less than thirty days before Rosh Hashanah of the sabbatical year he must uproot the plant because this is considered to be a tree that was planted on the sabbatical year. Such a tree is prohibited.
Section three: Rabbi Judah says that the plant or the graft takes roots within three days.  If it does not, it wonâ€™t survive. Hence, it is permitted to plant, graft or sink up until three days before Rosh Hashanah.
Section four:  Rabbis Yose and Shimon hold that the plant strikes roots within two weeks, hence it is permitted to plant, graft or sink vine-shoots up until two weeks before Rosh Hashanah.
