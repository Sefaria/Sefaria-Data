Sheviit, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
One may not cook sheviit vegetables in oil of terumah lest they become invalidated.   
But Rabbi Shimon permits it.   
The last thing exchanged is always subject to the sabbatical law, and the produce itself   remains forbidden. 

Explanation
Section one: There are two explanations for why this is prohibited and what it is exactly that might be invalidated. The first explanation is that the terumah might become invalidated because when one has to remove the sheviit produce (when it can no longer be found in the field) one will also have to get rid of the terumah oil it is cooked in. This is a problem because it is forbidden to destroy pure terumah. 
The second explanation is that there is a fear that the sheviit vegetables will become invalidated. If the terumah oil becomes impure one will have to burn the vegetables along with the oil. This is a problem because it is forbidden to destroy sheviit produce (before it must be removed). 
Rabbi Shimon holds that there is no prohibition against invalidating holy food items such as sheviit and terumah. Hence he permits.
Section two: This section refers to one who buys food with sheviit money. As we have stated the sheviit money has the status of sheviit. If one buys meat, for instance, with the money, the meat now has the status of sheviit, and the money is completely unsanctified. If one then sells the meat for fish, the fish has the status of sheviit and the meat loses this status. This will continue no matter how many things are bought and sold. The last thing bought always has the status of sheviit. Along with this, the produce itself always retains the status of sheviit—buying it does not cause it to be “redeemed” as it does with second tithe.
