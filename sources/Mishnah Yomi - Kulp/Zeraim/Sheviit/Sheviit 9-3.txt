Sheviit, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Three

Introduction 
This mishnah is a continuation of yesterday’s mishnah, which dealt with the division of the land of Israel into three territories.

Mishnah Three
Why did they speak of three territories? So that they may eat in each country until the last of the seventh year produce in that country is ended.   
Rabbi Shimon says: they have spoken of three countries only in the case of Judea, but all other territories are to be regarded as King’s mountain (Har Hamelekh). 
And all other territories are the same with regard to the olive and date.  

Explanation 
Section one: This is the same explanation that we provided in the introduction to yesterday’s mishnah. The reason that they divided the land of Israel into three territories was to allow one to eat produce as long as that produce was found somewhere else in that specific sub-territory, for instance, the Lower Galilee.
Section two: Rabbi Shimon disagrees with the entire meaning of the division of the land into three territories. The only land divided into three territories is Judea, but the rest of the land of Israel follows the King’s Mountain, the mountainous region in Judea. In other words, people in the Galilee and in Transjordan can eat a certain produce as long as that produce is found in the region of the King’s Mountain.
Section four: It is unclear whether this section is Rabbi Shimon’s opinion, or that of the anonymous author of section one. In either case, someone holds that when it comes to olives and dates, as long as they can be found on the trees anywhere in the land of Israel, one can store them in one’s home. In other words, there is no division of the land of Israel when it comes to olives and dates.
