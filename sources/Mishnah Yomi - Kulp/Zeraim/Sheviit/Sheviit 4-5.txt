Sheviit, Chapter Four, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with cutting down trees during the Shemitah year.

Mishnah Five
One who cuts down branches of an olive tree, he may not cover up [the stump] with earth, but he may cover it with stones or straw.   
One who cuts down branches of a sycamore tree, he may not cover up [the stump] with earth, but he may cover it with stones or straw. 
One may not cut down from a virgin sycamore in the seventh year, for this would constitute actual labor.   
Rabbi Judah says: in its usual manner, it is forbidden. Rather he either cuts it ten handbreadths above [the soil], or he cuts it down to ground level.

Explanation
Section one:  This section deals with a person who cuts down branches of an olive tree.  Covering up the stump with earth would improve the tree by allowing it to rejuvenate. Hence this is prohibited.  However, he may cover it up with stones or straw. This would prevent the tree from drying out. Since this work maintains the health of the tree rather than improving the tree, it is permitted. 
Section two: This section teaches the same halakhah with regard to sycamore trees.
Section three: A virgin sycamore is a sycamore from which branches have never been cut down.  When one cuts the tree down to its roots it strengthens the tree by making it grow thicker.  Since this improves the tree it is forbidden on the sabbatical year. Again, maintenance work is permitted but improving is prohibited.
Section four: Rabbi Judah agrees that to cut down parts of the tree is forbidden, but he holds that if it is cut down in an unusual manner it is permitted. The usual way would be to cut it down to a size of less than ten handbreadths. This is prohibited. There are two unusual ways to cut it down.  Either he cuts it down and leaves more than ten handbreadths, or he cuts it down all the way to the ground leaving nothing.
