Sheviit, Chapter Three, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with the topic of which stones may be removed from a field without it looking like he is clearing his field for planting.

Mishnah Nine
Shoulder-stones may be removed from any place. 
And the contractor may bring them from anywhere.   
Which are shoulder-stones? Any one that cannot be picked up with one hand, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
But Rabbi Yose says: the name is to be taken literally; those that are carried on a man’s shoulder, either two or three at a time.

Explanation
Section one:  Since it will be clear when he removes the shoulder-stones that he is going to use them in building and that he is not removing them in order to clear his field, it is always permitted to remove such stones.
Section two: A building contractor is allowed to bring stones that are even smaller than shoulder-stones because it is obvious that he is taking them for building and not in order to clear a field.  
Others interpret a “contractor” to mean one who has contracted the field, meaning that is he is sharecropping it for someone else.  Since this is not his field, it is more permissible for him to take stones out of it and he may take stones that are even smaller than shoulder-stones.  
Section three:  Of course, we now have to define what shoulder-stones are. According to Rabbi Meir a shoulder-stone is just another way of saying a stone that is too large for a person to pick up with one hand.  
Rabbi Yose on the other hand does not understand the term “shoulder-stone” to signify the size of the stone. Rather this term refers to the way that they are carried, two or three on one’s shoulder at the same time.
