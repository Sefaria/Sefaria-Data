Sheviit, Chapter Two, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Most of today’s mishnah deals with pruning a tree on the sixth year.

Mishnah Three
They may clear away stones until Rosh Hashanah.   
They may trim, prune and remove [excess parts of the tree] until Rosh Hashanah. 
Rabbi Joshua says: just as one may trim and remove in the fifth year so too may one perform this work in the sixth year.   
Rabbi Shimon says: as long as I may legally tend the tree itself, I may remove [excess parts of it].  

Explanation 
Section one:  Clearing away stones is permitted all the way until the end of the sixth year.  It is prohibited, however, during the sabbatical year itself, although this prohibition is only derabanan.
Section two:  These are three different words for removing parts of the tree in order to give it more room to grow, or for it to grow stronger.  These three activities are all permitted up until Rosh Hashanah, again because they are not biblically prohibited during the sabbatical year.
Section three:  Albeck explains that according to Rabbi Joshua, the pruning of the sixth year must be like that of the fifth year.  If the pruning done in the fifth year continues into the sixth year, then the pruning done in the sixth year may continue into the seventh year. However, if the pruning done in the fifth year ends before Rosh Hashanah, then the following year’s pruning must also end before Rosh Hashanah.  In other words, he sets his pattern in the fifth year and he must continue to follow it in the sixth year.
Section four:  In the sixth year one may tend the tree by plowing around it only up until Shavuot. Therefore, according to Rabbi Shimon, one may prune it only up until Shavuot as well. To Rabbi Shimon pruning is just another form of tending the tree, and hence the same rules apply.
