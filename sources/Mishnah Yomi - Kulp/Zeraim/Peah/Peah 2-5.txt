Peah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with the question of when one gives one peah and when one gives two peahs.  As we shall see what determines how many peahs he gives is usually not how many times he brings his grain to the threshing floor to separate the chaff from the wheat. Rather what determines is mostly how many types of species of grain that he planted. 

Mishnah Five
He who plants his field with one kind of seed, even though he makes up of it two threshing-floors, he gives only one peah [for the lot]. 
If he plants it of two kinds, even though he makes up of it one threshing-floor, he must give two peahs.   
One who plants his field with two species of wheat:
If he makes up of it one threshing-floor, he gives only one peah; 
But if two threshing-floors, he gives two peahs.

Explanation
Section one:  If he planted his field with one kind of seed, for instance wheat, and he harvested it on two separate occasions and brought it two separate times to the threshing floor, he is only obligated to give one peah.  Thus if he gave peah for the produce the first time he brought it, he need not bring peah again.
Section two:  In contrast, if he planted two different kinds of seeds he must give two different peahs, even if he threshed both types of grains together at the threshing floor.  What this means is that if he gave peah from the first kind of seed he must still give peah from the other one.  
Section three:  This is an in-between case.  He plants the same type of seed but they are two different species of wheat.  Same family, different species.  In this case it makes a different how many times he brings the harvest to the threshing floor.  If he brings it once, then he must give only one peah.  But if he brings it twice he must give two peahs.
