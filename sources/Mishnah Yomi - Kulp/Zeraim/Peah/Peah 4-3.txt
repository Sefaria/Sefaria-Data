Peah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Three

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with how the poor actually collect the peah, meaning what constitutes taking possession of the peah such that it belongs to the specific poor person who took possession of it.

Mishnah Three
If [a poor man] took some of the peah [already collected] and threw it onto the remainder [not yet collected], he gets none of it.   
If he fell down upon it, or spread his cloak over it, they take the peah away from him.   
The same applies to gleanings and the forgotten sheaf. 

Explanation
Section one:  Generally, one can “acquire” something by throwing one’s possessions on top of it.  By throwing some peah on top of other peah the poor person is trying to take possession of it and at the same time hide it from other poor people.  Therefore we penalize him and he doesn’t get to own any of the peah.
Section two: Again, the poor person is attempting to acquire more of the peah than he seems to be able to hold in his hands. Since he is being greedy and taking peah away from other poor people, we penalize him and he loses all of his peah, even the stuff that he already collected.
Section three:  The same laws apply to gleanings, the sheaves that fall when the owner is harvesting, or forgotten sheaves. A poor person cannot acquire them by throwing himself or his possessions on them and if he does, we penalize him.
