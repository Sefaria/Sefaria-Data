Peah, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah continues to discuss the maximum amount of money a person can have in order to qualify for certain benefits given to the poor.

Mishnah Eight 
One who possesses two hundred zuz, may not take gleanings” the forgotten sheaf, peah or the poor man’s tithe. 
If he possesses two hundred minus one denar, then even if a thousand [men] each give him at the same time, he may accept.   
If he had [two hundred zuz] mortgaged to a creditor or to his wife’s ketubah, he may take. 
They do not force him to sell his house or his tools. 

Explanation
Section one:  In order for a person to be eligible to take the agricultural gifts, he must have less than two hundred zuz to his name.  While it is extremely difficult to determine how much purchasing power there was in those times to this amount of money, we can note that this is the same amount as a woman’s ketubah.
Section two:  If he has less than two hundred zuz (a denar is equivalent to a zuz), he can accept the agricultural gifts, even if a thousand people give to him at the same time. This would obviously put him “over the top” in terms of net worth.  Nevertheless, since when each person gives him their gifts he is officially poor, he can accept from everyone.  
Section three:  If he had money, but that money had a lien on it, either to a creditor or to his wife’s ketubah, which is essentially a debt document, then that money does not count and he may take the agricultural gifts.
Section four:  Finally, only cash counts, not property.  If he is poor but owns a house or some tools, for instance, they don’t force him to sell his property in order to buy food. Rather, although he has more than two hundred zuz worth of property, he may still take the agricultural gifts.
