Peah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Five

Introduction
The general rule of this mishnah is if that two things left lying together are considered to have been forgotten but three things left lying together are assumed to have been left there intentionally so that the owner could come back and collect them later.  Hence they are not considered forgotten. This rule applies to two different types of gifts to the poor:  “forgotten” and “gleanings.”  The category of gleanings can be divided into two different types, each with its own Hebrew term: grain (leket) and grapes (peret).
In the sixth section of the mishnah we learn that the opinions found in the first five all belong to Bet Hillel. In contrast, Bet Shammai holds that if three things are left together in the field they are considered forgotten or gleanings. Only if four things are left together do they still belong to the owner.

Mishnah Five
Two sheaves [left lying together] are “forgotten,” but three are not “forgotten.”   
Two bundles of olives or carobs are “forgotten” but three are not “forgotten.” 
Two flax-stalks are “forgotten”, but three are not “forgotten”. 
Two grapes are considered “grape gleanings,” but three are not “grape gleanings.”
Two ears of grain are deemed “gleanings,” but three are not gleanings.”
All these [rulings] are according to Bet Hillel.  And concerning them all Bet Shammai says that three [that are left] belong to the poor, and four belong to the owner.
