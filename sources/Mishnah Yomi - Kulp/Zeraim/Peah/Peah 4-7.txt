Peah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a person who dedicates his grain to the Temple and then redeems it.  One does not have to give peah or the other agricultural gifts from fields that have been dedicated to the Temple, so the question is, does he have to give them from a field that has been dedicated and then redeemed.  

Mishnah Seven
One who dedicated standing grain [to the Temple] and then redeemed it while it was still standing grain, he is liable [to give the agricultural gifts to the poor].   
[If he dedicated] sheaves and redeemed them while they were still sheaves, he is liable.   
[If he dedicated] standing grain and redeemed it [when it was already in] sheaves, he is exempt, since at the time when it became liable it was exempt.

Explanation
Section one:  In this case he dedicated and redeemed the stalks of grain while they were still standing in the field. Since at the time of harvesting they had already lost their sanctity by being redeemed, he must give all of the agricultural offerings.
Section two:  If he dedicated the grain after he had harvested it and bundled it into sheaves, and then redeemed the sheaves, he is liable because at the time of harvest he had not yet dedicated them, and they were his.  
Section three:  In this case he dedicated the grain while it was still in standing in the field, then he harvested it into sheaves and then he redeemed it.  Since the grain was exempt from the agricultural gifts at the time of harvesting, he is exempt from giving them even after he has redeemed the grain.
