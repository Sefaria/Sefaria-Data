Peah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
The first section of our mishnah deals with the owner of a field who transfers title over the peah to a poor person without the poor person being present.  The second half of the mishnah deals with the fields of non-Jews.

Mishnah Nine
One who collected peah and said, “This is for so-and-so a poor man:” 
Rabbi Eliezer says: he has thus acquired it for him.   
The sages say: he must give it to the first poor man he finds.   
Gleanings, the forgotten sheaf and the peah of non-Jews are subject to tithes, unless he [the non-Jew] had declared them ownerless. 

Explanation
Section one:  According to Rabbi Eliezer, a field owner can harvest his own peah and by mere declaration transfer ownership to a poor person of his choosing.  This would seem to follow the general rule that a person can benefit another person even though that person is not in his presence.  However, the other rabbis disagree and say that the peah remains peah and can still be taken by the first person who comes across it.  This would seem to prevent owners from selecting one poor person over another, and potentially corrupting the system of “first come, first serve.”  
Section two:  Gleanings, forgotten sheaves and peah that are taken from a field of a Jew are not liable to be tithed, meaning the poor person can eat them without tithing them. However, if they are taken from the field of a non-Jew then they are liable for tithes because the non-Jew was not liable to give the gifts to the poor in the first place.  In other words, these are not technically considered gleanings, forgotten sheaves or peah, but rather just ordinary produce. The only way that they can be exempt from tithes is if the owner declared them ownerless and gave them to the poor as ownerless property.  Ownerless property is always exempt from tithes, as we shall learn when we learn tractate Maasrot.
