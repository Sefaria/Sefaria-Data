Peah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah is similar to yesterday’s mishnah in that it deals with a field that is not planted evenly. However, whereas in yesterday’s mishnah the field was a mix of olive trees and grain, the first half of today’s mishnah deals with a field planted solely with grain.
 
Mishnah Two 
One who gives his field a striped appearance and leaves behind moist stalks:  
Rabbi Akiva says: he gives peah from each and every stripe.  
But the sages say: from one stripe for the whole field. 
The sages agree with Rabbi Akiba that one who sows dill or mustard in three places must give peah from each place. 

Explanation
Section one: This section describes a person who made his field looked striped by fertilizing some places in the field such that the grain in those places grew faster than others, and then harvesting those places when the grain is dry and ready to be harvested, leaving the still-moist stalks behind.  According to Rabbi Akiva, he must give a separate peah from each and every stripe.  The stripes don’t join up into one field because in between them is unripe grain which serves to divide the field into many fields.  
The other sages disagree and say that he can give peah from one stripe for the whole field.  They look at the harvesting of the ripe stalks as the beginning of the harvesting of the entire field and therefore he can treat the field as one integrated field, leaving one peah for it all.
Section two:  It is customary to sow dill and mustard in several different places and therefore the sages agree that if he has one large field with dill or mustard planted in several different areas of the field, he must give peah separately from each patch.
