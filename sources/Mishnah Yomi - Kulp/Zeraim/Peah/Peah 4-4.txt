Peah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah again reflects the fierce competition among the poor which the rabbis anticipated from them when they came to collect peah.
 
Mishnah Four
[The poor] may not harvest peah with scythes or tear it out [of the ground] with spades, so that they might not strike one another [with these implements]. 

Explanation
Poor people cannot use metal instruments when they come to harvest the peah from the fields lest when doing so they kill one another with these instruments.
