Peah, Chapter One, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah teaches a general principle used to determine when the laws of peah are applicable.  

Mishnah Four
They said a general principle concerning peah: whatever is food, and is looked after, and grows from the land, and is harvested all at the same time, and is brought in for storage, is subject to the law of pe'ah. 
Grain and beans are in this category.

Explanation
Section one:  There are five rules for determining which plants are liable for peah.
1.  It has to be food, meaning something that people eat. Animal food does not count.
2.  It has to be looked after, meaning that it has an owner.  One who reaps an ownerless field does not have to leave peah.
3. It has to grow from the ground.  This, according to the rabbis, excludes mushrooms, which donâ€™t have any roots (again, according to the rabbis).
4.  There has to be one harvest season.  This excludes many fruits of trees which do not have one harvest season, such as figs.
5.  It has to be something that can be stored. This excludes vegetables which cannot be stored because they go bad.
Section two:  The mishnah lists two types of plants that definitely fit these categories.  The first is grain, which includes five types of grain (wheat, barley, spelt, rye and oats) and the second is beans.
