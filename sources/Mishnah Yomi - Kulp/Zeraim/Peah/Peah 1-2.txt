Peah, Chapter One, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah teaches that although there is no measure for peah, as we learned in yesterday’s mishnah, there is a minimum measure.  The mishnah also provides a general means for determining how generous a person should be.

Mishnah Two 
They should not leave peah of less than one-sixtieth [of the field]. 
But even though they said, “there is no measure for peah,” everything depends upon the size of the field, the number of poor people, and the extent of the yield. 

Explanation
Section one: One shouldn’t leave less than one-sixtieth of his field as peah, meaning the four corners added up together should equal at least 1/60 of the field.
Section two:  When one is trying to determine how generous to be with leaving peah he should take three things into account. The first is the size of the field. If he has a big field then he should be able to afford to leave more of it as peah.  The second is the number of poor people in his town. The more poor people the more peah. Finally he should take into account how much crops his field yielded, the better the yield the more he should give.
