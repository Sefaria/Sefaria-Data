Peah, Chapter Two, Mishnah One

Introduction
This mishnah deals with how one determines if a plot of land is considered one plot or two in terms of peah. If the plot is considered to be two then he must leave peah from both fields for he cannot give peah from one field in order to exempt the other.

Mishnah One 
The following divide a field for peah:  a stream, a pool, a private road, a public road, a public path, a private path in constant use in summer and the rainy season, fallow land, a plowed field and a different seed.  
One who harvested for animal fodder, [the plot] serves divides, the words of Rabbi Meir.
But the sages say: it does not stop for peah unless it is plowed. 

Explanation
Section one:  If one of these things is found in a given field then the field is considered to be two and he must leave peah in both. Most of these are self-explanatory. The private path must be in constant use for it to be considered significant enough to divide the field.  A plowed field refers to one that was not planted, unlike a fallow field to which no work has been done.  Planting different seeds is another way of dividing one field from another.
Section two: One doesn’t have to leave peah from a field that has been harvested for the crops to be animal food.  Our mishnah deals with a case where one harvests a field early so that the unripe grain can be used as animal fodder. According to Rabbi Meir this harvest now divides the field into two. In other words we don’t look at this harvest as being part of the harvest of the remainder of the field and therefore the section that has been harvested is considered to be fallow. The other rabbis consider the harvest of the crops for animal food to be part of the larger harvest and hence this harvest in and of itself does not divide the field.  Only if before he harvests the rest of the field he goes and plows it does it serve to divide the field into two.
