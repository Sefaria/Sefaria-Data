Peah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah is a direct continuation of yesterday’s mishnah, which dealt with a case where most of the poor ask him to harvest the field and distribute the peah and one says to leave the peah in the field.
  
Mishnah Two
With hanging vine-branches and date-palm trees it is not so; even if ninety-nine [of the poor] say [to the owner] to leave it in the field and one says to distribute it, this latter is listened to, since he spoke in accordance with the halakhah.

Explanation
We learned in yesterday’s mishnah two principles relevant to today’s mishnah.  The first is that when it comes to vine-branches and date-palm trees, the owner should harvest the peah and distribute it to the poor. The second is that if most of the poor ask the owner to act against the accepted halakhah and one asks him to act according to the halakhah, he should follow the minority because he asks in accordance with the halakhah.
Hence, if most of the poor ask him to leave the grapes and dates and one asks him to harvest them and distribute, he must harvest the peah and distribute it, the view which is in accordance with the halakhah.
