Peah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah deals with peah for carob and olive trees.

Mishnah Four
As for carob trees, [they are not divided] as long as they see one another.   
Rabban Gamaliel said: we had this custom in the house of my father.  We would give separate peah from the olive trees in each direction and [one peah] for all the carob trees that saw one another. 
Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok said in his name:  also for the carob trees they had in the whole city [they only gave one peah].

Explanation
Section one:  For a field of carob trees to be considered one field all the trees have to do is “see one another.”  This means that someone standing next to one tree can see the other tree.  If he can then the owner gives one peah from both trees.
Section two:  Rabban Gamaliel relates the custom that he had in his father’s house with regard to giving peah from carob and olive trees.  He would give one peah from the olive trees that he had on all the different sides of the town.  All of the olive trees are considered as if they were all part of one field.  However, when it came to the carob trees he gave one peah for all of carob trees that were in sight of each other.  
Section three: Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok relates a different tradition in the name of Rabban Gamaliel.  According to this tradition, they also gave only one peah for all of the carob trees, just like they did for the olive trees.
