Peah, Chapter Five, Mishnah One

Introduction
This mishnah deals with gleanings that are, for various reasons, hard or impossible for the poor person to find.

Mishnah One 
If a pile of grain was stacked [on part of a field] from which gleanings had not yet been collected, whatever touches the ground belongs to the poor.  
If the wind scattered the sheaves, they estimate the amount of gleanings the field would have yielded and they give that to the poor.  
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: he must give to the poor the amount that would fall. 

Explanation
Section one:  If the field owner makes a stack of grain on a part of the field from which the poor have not yet collected their gleanings, then we penalize him and he loses the bottom part of the stack, that which touches the ground.  The poor person can, in a sense, say to the field owner, that any part of the stack that touched the ground might actually be gleanings and hence belongs to him.
Section two:  If the wind scattered all the sheaves, mixing the sheaves that belonged to the field owner with the sheaves that should belong to the poor, then we estimate how much gleanings the field would produce and we give that amount to the poor person.  
Section three:  Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says that we estimate how many gleanings would fall from a field of this size.  Kehati explains that the debate between Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel and the opinion in the previous section is that Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says that we determine the gleanings based on a typical field of this size, whereas the previous opinion says we estimate that specific field.
