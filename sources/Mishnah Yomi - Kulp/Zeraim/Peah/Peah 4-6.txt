Peah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a non-Jew who harvests his field and then converts. Non-Jews are not liable for the laws of peah, but Jews are, so the question isâ€”does he have to give the peah after he has already harvested the whole field.

Mishnah Six
A non-Jew who harvested his field and then converted, he is exempt from [leaving] gleanings, the forgotten sheaf and peah.   
Rabbi Judah makes him liable to leave the forgotten sheaf, since he becomes liable for the forgotten sheaf at the time of their binding.

Explanation
Section one:  The new convert is exempt from giving all of these agricultural offerings for a field that he harvested before he converted because according to the opinion in this section, the obligation to give these offerings is set at the time of the harvest. Since he was not obligated when he harvested them, because he was not Jewish, he does not become obligated after he converts.
Section two:  Rabbi Judah says that the obligation to give forgotten sheaves is only set at the time at which the sheaves are bound together. Therefore, if he converts before he binds the sheaves, he is obligated to give the ones that are forgotten. We shall learn more about these laws later in this tractate.
