Peah, Chapter Five, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with the potential problem of watering a field with a water wheel.

Mishnah Three 
They should not [irrigate a field] with a water wheel, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
The sages permit it, because it is still possible [for the poor to get their gleanings].  

Explanation
Section one:  Rabbi Meir prohibits watering a field with a water wheel before the poor come and collect their gleanings because the water will cause the gleanings to be ruined.
Section two: The other sages permit this because he can just pick up the gleanings and put them on the side and the poor can come and collect them from there. Furthermore, if he does end up ruining some of their gleanings, he can always compensate them for their losses.
