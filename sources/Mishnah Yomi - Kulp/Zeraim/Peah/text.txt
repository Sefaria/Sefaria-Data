Peah, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Nine

Introduction

Mishnah Nine
One who has fifty zuz and he is using them for his business, he must not take.   
And anyone who does not need to take [charity] and yet takes, will not depart from this world before he actually needs [charity] from others.   
And anyone who needs to take and does not take, will not die of old age until he supports others with his own money. 
Concerning him the verse says: “Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord and whose hope is the Lord” (Jeremiah 17:7).   
And so too a judge who judges in truth according to its truth.   
And anyone who is not lame or blind but pretends to be as one of these, he will not die of old age before he actually becomes one of these, as it is said, “He who searches for evil, it shall come upon him” (Proverbs 11:27) and it is also said: “Righteousness, righteousness shall you pursue.”   
And any judge who accepts a bribe or who perverts justice will not die in old age before his eyes have become dim, as it is said: “And you shall not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of those who have sight.”
