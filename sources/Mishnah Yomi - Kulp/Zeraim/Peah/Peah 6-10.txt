Peah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
This mishnah continues to define what things the “laws of forgotten” apply to.

Mishnah Ten
Grain used for fodder or [stalks] used for binding sheaves, and also garlic-stalks used for tying other bunches, or tied bunches of garlic and onions—they [all are not subject to the laws of] forgotten.  
Anything stored in the ground like arum, garlic and onions: 
Rabbi Judah says: they do not subject to the laws of “forgotten”;   
But the sages say: they are subject to the laws of “forgotten.” 

Explanation
Section one:  The laws of forgotten do not apply to grain used as animal food, nor to stalks or garlic-stalks that will be used for binding other sheaves or other bunches of garlic.  While mentioning the rules of garlic, the mishnah mentions another rule.  If a person ties small bunches of garlic or onions with the intent of coming back and putting them together into larger bunches, the small bunches are not subject to the laws of forgotten, because his intention is to go back and collect them.
Section two:  According to Rabbi Judah, the rules of forgotten do not apply to things that are stored in the ground after they are harvested.  This seems to be derived from the verse, “And you forget a sheaf in the field” (Deuteronomy 24:19)—the word “field” means that the “forgotten” stuff has to be above the field, and not buried in the field.  This excludes arum (a type of onion), garlic and onions.  The rabbis interpret “the field” to include things stored in the ground of the field, such that they too are subject to the laws of forgotten.
