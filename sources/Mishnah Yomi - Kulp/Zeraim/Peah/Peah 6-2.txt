Peah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with a sheaf that was left lying near something specific. The question is, might the field owner have left it there intentionally so that he would know where to find it later?  If he did, then the rules of the forgotten sheaf do not apply and the sheaf does not belong to the poor.  This would mean that only a sheaf left lying in the middle of the field, or at least not near anything specific, would be considered to be forgotten. 

Mishnah Two
A sheaf left near a stone fence, or near a stack [of grain] or near oxen, or near equipment: 
Bet Shammai says: it is not considered “forgotten”;  
Bet Hillel says: it is considered “forgotten.”

Explanation
According to Bet Shammai we suspect that he may have left the sheaf there on purpose in which case it is not considered to be forgotten. In contrast, Bet Hillel says that it is considered forgotten.
