Peah, Chapter Three, Mishnah One

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with small plots of grain that are planted in between olive trees and with the question of whether he has to give peah from each plot as if it were a separate field or whether he can give one peah from all the plots together.

Mishnah One
Plots of grain between olive trees:
Bet Shammai say: peah from each and every plot.
But Bet Hillel says: one peah for them all. 
And they agree that if the ends of the rows enter one into the other, he gives one peah for them all.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Bet Shammai since the rows of olive trees break up the plots of grain, he must give peah separately for each and every plot.  According to Bet Hillel we still look at the grain as if it was all one field and he can give one peah for all of the plots together.
Section two: Bet Shammai agrees with Bet Hillel that if the plots run into each other, in other words instead of rectangular plots surrounded by olive trees, there are rows where the end of one plot runs into the beginning of the other, then he can give peah for all of the plots together.
