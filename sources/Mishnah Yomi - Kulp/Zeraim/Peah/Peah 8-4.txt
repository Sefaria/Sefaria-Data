Peah, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Today’s mishnah continues to discuss when a poor am haaretz is believed to state that that which he has is from agricultural gifts and is exempt from tithes.

Mishnah Four
They are trusted concerning raw vegetables, but they are not trusted concerning are cooked ones, unless he has only a little bit, for so it was the custom of a householder to take out of his stew-pot [and give a little to the poor].

Explanation
Normally, a householder will give his vegetables to the poor as poor man’s tithe before he cooks them. After all, why bother cooking them if you’re just going to give them away?  Therefore, the poor am haaretz is only believed with regard to his raw vegetables and not cooked ones.  However, if he has just a small amount of cooked vegetables and he claims that these come from poor man’s tithe he is believed because a householder will give a small amount of the vegetables from his pot to the poor man as tithe.
