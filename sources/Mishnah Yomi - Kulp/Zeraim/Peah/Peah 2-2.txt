Peah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Introduction 
This mishnah continues to discuss what divides a field.

Mishnah Two
A water channel that makes harvesting [on one side] impossible [while standing on the other side], Rabbi Judah says: it divides.   
But all of the hills that can be tilled with a hoe, even though cattle cannot pass over it in with their equipment, [is regarded as part of the field] he gives one peah from it all. 

Explanation
Section one:  This mishnah teaches that a water channel divides a field only if the channel is wide enough that one cannot stand on one side and harvest the other side.  
Section two: We should note that the first words of this mishnah are a quote of Isaiah 7:25.  I am not sure why the mishnah here uses biblical language.  
In any case, the mishnah refers to hills that lie in the middle of a field that are tilled with a hoe.  One is obligated to give peah from this type of field even though oxen cannot plow their field because it is too hilly. Furthermore, the hills do not serve to divide the field since they are plowed by a person and planted.
