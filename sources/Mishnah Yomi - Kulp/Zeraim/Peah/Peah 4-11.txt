Peah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Eleven

Introduction
This mishnah deals with grain that is found in ant holes in a field. The question is whether they count as gleanings, which as we saw in yesterdayâ€™s mishnah, is grain that falls during the time of the harvest.  

Mishnah Eleven 
[Grain found in] ant holes where the stalks are still standing, behold it still belongs to the owner.
After the harvesters [had passed over them], those found in the top parts [of the ant holes belong] to the poor, but [those found] on the bottom parts [belong] to the owner. 
Rabbi Meir says: it all belongs to the poor, for gleanings about which there is any doubt are regarded as gleanings. 

Explanation
Section one: If the stalks are still standing that means that the field has not yet been plowed.  In such a case, the grain that has fallen into the ant holes in the ground still belongs to the owner.
Section two:  If the field has already been harvested then we can assume the top layer of grain in the holes fell out during the harvest and therefore it belongs to the poor. The bottom layer of grain, however, may have fallen out before the harvest and therefore it still belongs to the owner. 
Rabbi Meir says that when we have a doubt as to whether grain is considered to be gleanings or not, then we regard it as gleanings and it goes to the poor.  Generally there is a rule that the burden of proof is upon the claimant. In this case the poor person is the claimant, for he is coming to take the grain from its original owner.  This seems to be the rule invoked by the opinion in the previous section. Nevertheless, according to Rabbi Meir, in this case, perhaps because the claimant is poor, this general is not applied.
