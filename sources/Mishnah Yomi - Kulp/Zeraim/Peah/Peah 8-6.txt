Peah, Chapter Eight Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah continues to discuss how one divvies out poor man’s tithe to the poor.

Mishnah Six
This measure was stated for the priest, Levite and Israelite alike.   
If he was saving some [to give to his poor relatives], he can retain half and give the other half away. 
If he has only a small amount, then he must place it before them and they then divide it among themselves. 

Explanation
Section one: When it comes to receiving poor man’s tithe, all of Israel is treated alike.  No one receives less than the amount prescribed in section one.  Even though priests receive terumah and Levites receive other tithes, they are still eligible for the poor man’s tithe.  
Section two:  If the person who has poor man’s tithe to give out wishes to save some for his poor relatives, he may do so, but he may only save half of the tithe. The rest he must give out freely to whichever poor person comes his way.  It seems to me that the mishnah acknowledges our nepotistic impulses and even grants them some legitimacy.  It is natural and even praiseworthy to want to help one’s relatives before one helps a stranger.  However, our impulses must be curbed and we must also realize that our duty to help the poor extends not only to our family, but to outsiders as well.  One can save some poor man’s tithe for his family, but he must also give away at least half of it to other poor people.  
Section three:  If the person giving out his poor man’s tithe only has a little bit to give out and it is not enough to fulfill the minimum amounts listed above in mishnah five, then he should just put out what he has and let the poor divided it up among themselves.  Perhaps this is a way of avoiding suspicion that he is holding back.  Alternatively, the mishnah is teaching that this is better than holding it back until he saves up enough to meet the minimum measures in mishnah five.
