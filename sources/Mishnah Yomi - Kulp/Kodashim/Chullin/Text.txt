Mishnah. If its nose is perforated, nipped, or slit, or its upper lip perforated, mutilated, or slit [these are disqualifying blemishes].

   	   	mishnah. If the incisors are broken off or levelled [to the gum] or the molars are torn out [completely], [these are disqualifying blemishes in a first born]. But r. Hanina b. Antigonus said: we do not examine behind the molars,   nor the molars themselves.  

   	mishnah. [other blemishes are] if the bag   is mutilated or the genitals of a female animal in the case of sacrificial offerings:   if the tail is mutilated from the bone   but not from the joint;   or if the top end [root] of the tail divides the bone   or if there is flesh between one joint and another [in the tail] to the amount of a finger's breadth.
Mishnah. If [a first born] has no stones or if it only has one stone, [it is a blemish]. R. Ishmael says: if it has two bags, then it has two stones, but if it only has one bag, then it only has one stone. R. Akiva says: [the animal] is placed on its buttock  and he rubs [the bag].  If a testicle is [there, inside the bag] it will eventually come out. It happened that one rubbed it and [the stone] did not come out, but when it was slaughtered [the stone] was found attached to the loins, and r. Akiva permitted [the animal]  while r. Johanan b. Nuri prohibited it. 
Mishnah. If [a first born] has five feet or if it has only three feet or if its feet are closed   like that of a donkey or a shahul or a kasul [these are blemishes]. What is meant by shahul? [an animal] with a dislocated hip [without the sinews being severed]. What is meant by kasul? [an animal] one of whose hips is higher than the other.

Mishnah. If the bone of the fore-foot [of a first born] or of its hind-foot is broken, even though it is not noticeable,   [this is a blemish]. These blemishes ila   enumerated in jabneh and the sages agreed with him. He also added another three cases [of blemishes]. They thereupon said to him: we have only heard these [already mentioned previously]. One which has its eyeball round like that of a man or a mouth like that of a swine or one which has lost the greater part of the anterior of the tongue, [these are the additional blemishes]. A subsequent beth din ruled however:   each of these cases is a [disqualifying] blemish.
	mishnah. And it happened that the lower jaw [of a first born] was larger than the upper jaw. R. Shimon b. Gamaliel asked the sages [for a ruling] and they said: this is a blemish.
Mishnah. In regard to the ear of a kid which was doubled,  the sages ruled [as follows]: if it is all one bone,  it is a blemish, but if it is not all one bone,  it is not a blemish.

   	r. Hanina the son of gamaliel says: if the tail of a kid is like that of a swine, or if the tail does not possess three vertebrae, this is a blemish.
	mishnah. R. Hanina the son or antigonus says: if [a first born] has a yabeleth   in its eye or if a bone of its fore-foot or hindleg is defective,   or if the bone of the mouth   split or one eye is [abnormally] large and the other small, or one ear [abnormally] large and the other small, being visibly so and not merely in actual measurement.   All these are disqualifying blemishes. R. Judah says: if one stone is as large as two of the other. [this is a blemish]. The sages, however, did not concur with r. Judah's ruling.

	mishnah. If the tail of a [firstborn] calf does not reach the ‘arkub   , [it is a blemish]. The sages said: the growth of all calves is in this manner.   As long as [the animals] grow, the tails also extend [below]. Which arkub mentioned is meant? R. Hanina. B. Antigonus says: the ‘arkub in the thigh.
Ishnah. In consequence of these blemishes we may slaughter a firstborn animal, and consecrated animals rendered unfit [for the altar] in consequence of these blemishes may be redeemed. 

Mishnah. And in consequence of the following blemishes we must not slaughter a first born either in the temple  or without the temple:  white spots on the cornea and water [dripping from the eye] when not permanent features, or molars which have been broken but not torn out [completely] or [an animal] affected with garab,  yabeleth,   or hazzazith,   an old [animal] or a sick one, [an animal] of offensive smell or appearance, or [an animal] which with a transgression has been committed   or an animal which is known to have killed a human being on the testimony of one witness or of the owners.   A tumtum   or a hermaphrodite   can be slaughtered neither in the temple nor without the temple.   R. Ishmael however says: there is no greater blemish than that [of a hermaphrodite].   But the sages say: it has not [the law] of a first-born and may be shorn and worked with.  
Mishnah. These blemishes [named above], whether permanent or transitory, make human beings unfit.  To them must be added [in the case of blemishes of human beings]. Kilon,  liftan, makkaban, one whose head is angular and one whose occiput has the shape of sekifas [lintel]. As regards humpbacked men, r. Judah considers them fit,  whereas the sages consider them unfit. A bald-headed person is unfit [for the priesthood]. Bald-headed [in the legal sense] is he who has not a line of hair from ear to ear. If however he has, then he is fit.
Mishnah. One who has no eyebrows or has only one eyebrow [is unfit], this being the gibben of the bible.   R. Dosa says:   one whose eyebrows lie flat [overshadowing the eyes]. R. Hanina b. Antigonus says: one who has a double back or a double spine.  

   	mishnah. A harum is unfit [for the priesthood]. What is harum? One who can paint both of his eyes with one movement.   One whose two eyes are above or whose two eyes are below;   a person whose one eye sees above and the other below; one who takes in the room and the ceiling in one glance;   one who covers [his eyes] from the sun;   a zagdan   and a ziran — [all these are unfit for the priesthood]. One whose eyelids have fallen off is unfit [for the priesthood] for appearance sake.  

	mishnah. One whose eyes are as large as a calf's or as small as those of a goose; or whose body is [unduly] large for his limbs;   [unduly] small for his limbs; or whose nose is [unduly] large for his limbs; or whose nose is [unduly] small for his limbs; zomem and zomea’. What is zomea’? One whose auricles are very small. What is zomem? One whose auricles resemble a sponge. If the upper lip overlaps the lower or the lower lip overlaps the upper, this is a blemish. One whose teeth have fallen out is unfit [for the priesthood] for appearance sake.
If one has large  breasts like those of a woman, one whose belly is swollen, one whose navel projects, [owing to illness], one who is subject to epileptic spells even at infrequent intervals,  one who is subject to asthmatic spells,  a me'ushban and a ba'al geber [all these are unfit for the priesthood].
Mishnah. If he has no stones at all or only one stone, this is the biblical meroah ashek.   R. Ishmael says: if he has his testicles crushed.   R. Akiva says: if he has wind in his testicles. R. Hanina b. Antigonus says: [meroah ashek means]: if he has a black complexion.  
   	mishnah. If one knocks his ankles [against each other, in walking]   or rubs his legs [against each other]  
A ba'al ha-pihin and an ‘ikkel — [all these defects render a priest unfit]. What is an ‘ikkel? One whose legs do not touch each other when he puts his feet together, [bandy legged]. If he has a lump projecting from his thumb,  or if his heel projects behind, or if his feet are wide like those of a goose  or if his fingers lie one above the other or if they are grown together up to the root [the middle joint], he is fit [for the priesthood]; if below the root,  if he cuts it,  he is also fit. If he has an additional finger and he cut it off, if there was a bone in it, he is unfit,  but if not, he is fit. If he has additional fingers and additional toes, on each hand and foot six fingers and six toes, [making altogether] twenty-four [fingers and toes], r. Judah declares such a priest fit for the priesthood,  whereas the sages declare him unfit. If one has equal strength in both hands, rabbi declares him unfit,  whereas the sages declare him fit. 
	mishnah. [if one is like an] ethiopian, a gihur, a labkan, a kippeah,   a dwarf, a deaf-mute, an imbecile, intoxicated, or afflicted with plague marks which are clean   — [these defects] disqualify in human beings   but not in animals. R. Shimon b. Gamaliel says: one should not for choice sacrifice a mad animal. R. Eleazar   says: also those afflicted with warts are unfit in human beings but are fit in animals.
  	mishnah. The following are fit in the case of human belngs,   but unfit in the case of animals: a father with its son,   a trefah, an animal extracted by means of the caesarean section.   A priest who contracts an illegal marriage   is unfit [for the priesthood] until he vows not to derive any benefit from the woman.   Also one who makes himself unclean through contact with the dead is unfit, until he undertakes that he will no longer make himself unclean through the dead.
	mishnah. There is one who is [counted as] a firstborn [with respect to] inheritance  but not with respect to redemption from a priest;  a first-born with respect to redemption from a priest but not a first-born [with respect] to inheritance; a firstborn [with respect both] to inheritance and to redemption from a priest; and [as] a first-born [in respect neither] to inheritance nor redemption from a priest. Which is a first-born [in respect] of inheritance but not of redemption from a priest? One which follows an untimely birth whose head came forth alive  or one born in the ninth month whose head came forth dead,  or when a woman discharges something like an animal, beast or bird.  These are the words of r. Meir. But the sages say: [it is not considered an opening of the womb] until [the discharge] has the form of a human being.  If [a woman] discharges a sandle like   foetus or a placenta   or a foetus   having an articulated shape, or if an embryo came out by pieces,   [the infant] which follows after them is a first-born [with respect] to inheritance but not a first-born to redemption from a priest. If one who never had children previously married a woman who had already given birth,   even if she had given birth when she was a bondwoman, but is free [now], or [had borne a child] when she was a heathen but has since become a proselyte if after coming to the israelite she bears to him, [the infant] is also considered a first-born [with respect] to inheritance but not a first-born to redemption from a priest.   R. Jose the galilean says however: [the infant] is a first-born [with respect] to inheritance and also one who must be redeemed from a priest, because it is said in the scriptures: openeth the womb among the children of israel,   [intimating] until the opening of the womb is ‘[of the children] of israel’.   If one had children already and married a woman who had never given birth previously or if she became a proselyte   when pregnant or if she was freed when pregnant and she gave birth; [if there was some confusion between] her and a priestess,   [between] her and a levite's daughter,   [between] her and a woman who had already given birth;   and likewise [if a woman] who did not wait three months after her husband's death, married and gave birth and it is not known if the infant was born in the ninth month since the death of the first [husband] or in the seventh month since she married the second, it is a first-born to redemption from a priest   but not a first-born [with respect] to inheritance.  
   	mishnah. Which is a first-born both [in respect] of inheritance   and of redemption from a priest? If [a woman] discharges a sac full of water or full of blood or an abortion consisting of a bag full of many-coloured substance; if [a woman] discharges something like fish or locusts   or reptiles, or creeping things, or if she discharges on the fortieth day [of conception],   [the infant] which follows after [these discharges] is a first-born both [in respect] of inheritance and of redemption from a priest. Neither a foetus extracted by means of the caesarean section   nor the infant which follows   is either a first-born for inheritance or a first-born to be redeemed from a priest. R. Shimon however says: the first   is a first-born of inheritance and the second is a first-born as regards the redemption with five sela's.
Ah. If a man's wife had never before given birth and she gave birth to two males, he gives five sela's to the priest.  If one of them dies within thirty days [of birth] the father is exempt.  If the father dies and the sons survive, r. Meir says: if they gave the five sela's before the property was divided up, it is irrecoverable  but if not, they are exempt. But r. Judah says: there is a claim on the property. If she gave birth to a male and a female, the priest receives nothing. 
	mishnah. If two women   had never before given birth and they gave birth to two males, he [the father] gives ten sela's to the priest. If one of the children dies within thirty days [of its birth], if he gave the redemption money to one priest alone, he returns five sela's to him,   but if he gave it to two priests, he cannot reclaim the money from them.   If they gave birth to a male and a female or to two males and a female,   he gives five sela's to the priest.   If they gave birth to two females and a male or to two males and two females, the priest receives nothing.   If one woman had given birth before and the other had never given birth, and they gave birth to two males, he gives five sela's to the priest.   If one of the children died within thirty days [of its birth], the father is exempt.   If the father dies and the children survive, r. Meir says: if they gave the redemption money before the dividing up [of the property], it is irrecoverable, but if not, they are exempt, but r. Judah says: there is a claim on the property. If they gave birth to a male and a female, the priest receives nothing. If two women who had never before given birth married two men and gave birth to two males, the one father gives five sela's to the priest and the other gives five sela's to the priest. If one of the children died within thirty days [of its birth], if they gave the redemption money to one priest alone, he returns five sela's to them,   but if they gave the money to two priests, they are not able to claim it from them.   If they gave birth to a male and a female, the fathers are exempt from the duty of redemption,   whereas the son must redeem himself [as in any case he is a first-born]. If they gave birth to two females and a male or to two females and two males, the priest receives nothing.   If one woman had given birth before and the other had never before given birth, the women belonging to two husbands, and they gave birth to two males, the one whose wife had never before given birth gives five sela's to the priest. If they gave birth to a male and a female, the priest receives nothing.  
Mishnah. If the son dies within thirty days [of his birth] although he [the father] gave the priest [the five sela's], he must return them.   If, however, he dies after thirty days, although he has not yet given the five sela's, he must give them. If he dies on the thirtieth day, it is as if he died on the previous day.   But r. Akiva says: if he gave [the five sela's] he cannot reclaim them, but if he had not yet given, he need not give.

   	

   	mishnah. If the father dies within thirty days,   [the infant] is under the presumption of not having been redeemed   until proof is brought that it has been redeemed. If the father, however, dies after thirty days, it is under the presumption of having been redeemed until he [the son] is told that he was not redeemed.   If both the father and the son required redemption as first-born, the father takes precedence of his son. But r. Judah says: his son comes first for the command to redeem him was upon his father,   and the command of his son is upon him.
H. The five sela's of a first-born take the tyrian maneh as their standard.   As regards the thirty shekels of a slave   and likewise the fifty shekels of one who violates a woman,   the indemnity for seduction   and the one hundred shekels of one who spreads an evil name   — in all these cases the holy shekel   is meant and take the tyrian maneh as their standard. All of these are redeemed   with money or money's worth with the exception of shekel payments.  
	mishnah. We must not redeem [a first-born of man] with slaves,   nor with notes of indebtedness,   nor with immovable properties, nor with objects of hekdesh.   If one gives a written acknowledgment to a priest that he owes him five sela's   he is bound to give them to him, although his son is not considered as redeemed thereby.   Therefore,   if the priest wishes to give him [the note of indebtedness] as a gift he is permitted to do so,   if one set aside the redemption money of his son and it became lost, he is responsible for it, because it says: shall be thine [but] thou shalt surely redeem.  
Mishnah. The first-born takes a double share of the father's estate but he does not take a double share of the mothers estate.   He also does not take a double share of the improvement in the value of the estate.   Nor does he take a double share of what will fall due [to the estate]   as he does of what is held in possession.
Nor can a woman claim with her kethubah [from these],  nor can daughters claim their support,  nor can a levir claim.  None of these take from the improvement in the value of the estate, nor of what will fall to the estate as they do of what is now held in possession.
Mishnah. The following do not return [to their owners] in jubilee:  the share of the first-born, [the inheritance of] one who inherits his wife's [estate] [and of] one who marries his sister-in-law  and a present. These are the words of r. Meir. But the sages say: a present has the law of a sale [of land].  R. Eleazar says however: all these return in jubilee. R. Johanan b. Berokah says: if one inherits his wife's estate, he returns it to the members of the family and allows them a deduction from the purchase money. 
Mishnah. The law concerning the tithe of cattle  is in force in palestine  and outside palestine, in the days when the temple exists and when it does not exist, [it applies] to hullin only but not to consecrated animals. It applies both to large cattle and sheep. (though none can be tithed for the other); to lambs and to goats (and one can be tithed for the other); to the new  breed and the old,  (though none can be tithed for the other). Now it might be rightly argued: seeing that new and old animals which are not treated as diverse kinds in regard to one another are yet not tithed one for the other, lambs and goats which are treated as diverse kinds in regard to one another, all the more should not be tithed one for the other. The text therefore states: and of the flock,  intimating that all kinds of flock are considered one [for purposes of tithing].
	mishnah. Animals are combined for purposes of tithing so long as they can still pasture within the distance that cattle wander.   And what is the distance over which they can wander while pasturing? — sixteen mils.   If there was between two groups of animals a distance of thirty-two mils,   they do not combine for the purpose of tithing. If however there was [a herd] in the middle [of the distance of thirty-two mils] he brings them [into one shed] and tithes them [at some point] in the middle.   R. Meir says: the [river] jordan is regarded as forming a division as regards the tithing of animals.  
Mishnah. An animal bought or given as a present is exempt from the law of cattle tithe.
	mishnah. If brothers became partners,   though they are still bound to pay agio,   they are exempt from the tithe of cattle.   And when they become liable to tithe of cattle,   they are exempt from paying agio;   if they acquired   animals [the cattle] from the estate,   they are bound [to tithe them].   But if not,   they are exempt from tithing; if   they first divided up the estate and then again became partners, they are bound to pay agio and are exempt from tithe of cattle.

   	mishnah. All [lambs] enter the shed to be tithed except kil'ayim,   trefah, offspring brought forth by means of the caesarean section, an animal too young for sacrifice, and an ‘orphan’ [animal]. And what is an ‘orphan’? When its dam has died during its birth or was slaughtered and subsequently gave birth. But r. Joshua says: even when the dam has been killed, if the hide is still intact the offspring is not an ‘orphan’ animal.

	mishnah. There are three periods   for the tithe of cattle.   In the peras   of p donkeyover, in the peras of pentecost and in the peras of tabernacles. These are the words of r. Akiva. Ben azzai says: on the twenty-ninth of adar, on the first of siwan and on the twenty-ninth of ab. R. Eleazar and r. Shimon say: on the first of nisan, on the first of siwan and on the twenty-ninth of elul. And why did they say the twenty-ninth of elul and not the first of tishri?   Because it is a holy day and you cannot tithe on a holy day.   Consequently the rabbis fixed it earlier, for the twenty-ninth of elul. R. Meir says: the first of elul is the new year for the tithe of cattle.   Ben azzai says: those born in elul are tithed by themselves.   All those born from the first of tishri until the twenty-ninth of elul combine [to enter into one shed].   Five lambs born before rosh hashanah   and five born after rosh hashanah do not combine. But five lambs born before the period [of tithing] and five after the period [of tithing] do combine [to enter one shed for tithing]. If so, why did they speak of three periods for the tithe of cattle?   [it is for the purpose of informing us that] until the arrival of the [tithing] period it is permitted to sell and kill [the animals],   but when the period has arrived he must not kill, though if he killed, he is not culpable.

	mishnah. How do we tithe animals? We bring them to a shed and make for them a small opening so that two shall not be able to go out at the same time. And we count [with the rod],   one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. And he marks every tenth lamb that goes out and says: this is [the tithe]’. If he failed to mark it, did not count them [the lambs] with a rod, or if he counted them while they were crouching or standing, they are still considered tithed. If he had one hundred [lambs] and he took ten   or if he had ten and he took one,   this is not [valid] tithe.   But r. Jose b. Judah says: this is [valid] tithe. If one [of the lambs] already counted   leaped among the flock [in the shed]   they are all exempt.   If one of them that was marked as tithe leaped among the flock [in the shed],   they all go to pasture until they become unfit for sacrifice,   and the owners may eat them in their unfit state.  
Mishnah. If two [lambs] came forth at the same time,   he counts them in pairs.   If he counted [the two]   as one, the ninth and the tenth are spoilt.   [if the ninth and the tenth came out at the same time, the ninth and the tenth are spoilt.]   If he called the ninth the tenth, the tenth the ninth and the eleventh the tenth, the three are holy. The ninth is eaten while blemished, the tenth is the tithe and the eleventh is sacrificed as a peace-offering, and it can effect a substitute.   These are the words of r. Meir. Said r. Judah: can that one substitute effect another substitute?   They said in the name of r. Meir: if it   were a substitute, it would not have been sacrificed.   If he called the ninth the tenth, the tenth the tenth and the eleventh the tenth, the eleventh is not consecrated.   The following is the rule: wherever the name of the tenth [animal] has not been eliminated therefrom,   the eleventh is not consecrated.
