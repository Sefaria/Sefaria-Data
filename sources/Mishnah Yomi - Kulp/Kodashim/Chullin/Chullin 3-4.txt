Hullin, Chapter Three, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Today’s mishnah teaches what defects do not render birds into a terefah. 

Mishnah Four
And the following [defects] do not render birds terefah: 
If the windpipe was pierced or cracked lengthwise; 
If a weasel struck it on the head in such a place as would not render it terefah.
If the crop was pierced 
Rabbi says: even if it was gone. 
If the innards protruded [from the body] but were not pierced.
If its wings were broken, or its legs; or if [the wing’s] feathers were plucked. 
Rabbi Judah says: if its down was gone it is invalid.

Explanation
Section one: This is the same defect that does not cause a beast to be a terefah (see mishnah two).
Section two: The opposite of the section two in yesterday’s mishnah.
Section three: Since I don’t know exactly what a “crop” is, I looked it up in Wikipedia. There the crop is defined in the following manner: “In a bird's digestive system, the crop is an expanded, muscular pouch near the  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullet" \o "Gullet" gullet or throat. It is a part of the digestive tract, essentially an enlarged part of the  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus" \o "Esophagus" esophagus. As with most other organisms that have a crop, the crop is used to temporarily store food. Not all birds have a crop.”  According to the first opinion, if the crop is pierced, the animal is not a terefah, but if the crop is missing, it is a terefah. Rabbi rules even more leniently and holds that even if the crop is removed, it is not a terefah.
Section four: As long as the innards were not pierced, the bird is not a terefah. 
Section five: A broken limb and plucked feathers on the wings do not make the bird into a terefah. Rabbi Judah holds, that if the bird’s soft cover of down was removed, it is a terefah.
