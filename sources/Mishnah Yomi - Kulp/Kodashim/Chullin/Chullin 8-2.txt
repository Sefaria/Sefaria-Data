Hullin, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
A person may wrap up meat and cheese in one cloth, provided they do not touch one another. 
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: two people at an inn may eat at the same table, the one meat and the other cheese, without concern.

Explanation
Section one: As long as the meat and cheese don’t touch, they may be wrapped together, without concern that someone will eat the two of them together. 
Section two: In yesterday’s mishnah we learned that meat and cheese should not be placed on the same table. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel states that if people are eating at an inn, they may eat off the same table. The reason that this is allowed is that people at an inn do not know each other and there is no concern that one person will come to eat from the other person’s food. If the two people do know each other, the mishnah would seem to not allow them to eat off of the same table.
