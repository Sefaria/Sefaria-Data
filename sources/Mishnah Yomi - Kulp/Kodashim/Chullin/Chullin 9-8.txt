Hullin, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah continues the discussion about hanging limbs and pieces of flesh.  Whereas yesterday’s mishnah discussed an animal, today’s mishnah discusses a human being.

Mishnah Eight
A limb or a piece of flesh which hangs loose from a person are clean. 
If the man died, the flesh is clean, the limb is unclean as a limb severed from the living body but is not unclean as a limb severed from a corpse, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
Rabbi Shimon declares it clean.

Explanation
Section one: As long as the limb or piece of flesh is attached to a live human being, it is clean. It is not a limb separated from a living being, because it is still attached. 
Section two: This debate is basically the same debate as we found in yesterday’s mishnah. When the person dies, the flesh is clean because it is considered as flesh that separated from the person while he was still alive. Such flesh is pure.
The limb is considered like a limb that was severed from a living animal, which is impure. It does not count as part of the corpse because we consider it to have fallen off the body while the person was still alive. This is the opinion of Rabbi Meir.
Rabbi Shimon considers the limb to also be clean, for the same reason that he considers the limb hanging from the dead animal’s corpse to be clean (see yesterday’s mishnah).
