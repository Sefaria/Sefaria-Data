Arakhin, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Today’s mishnah deals with the continuation of the verses about dedicating one’s “and of possession.” These verses read: 20“But if he does not redeem the land, and the land is sold to another, it shall no longer be redeemable: 21 when it is released in the jubilee, the land shall be holy to the Lord, as land proscribed; it becomes the priest's holding.”
As we can see, if the owner does not redeem the land, then the land becomes the property of the priests.  

Mishnah Three
If a man consecrated [his field] and then redeemed it, it does not go out of his possession in the Jubilee.   
If his son redeemed it, it reverts to his father in the Jubilee. 
If another person, or a relative redeemed it, and he redeemed it from his hand, it goes out [to the priests].   
If one of the priests redeemed it, and it was still in his possession, he cannot say: “Since it goes out to the priests in the Jubilee, and since it is now in my possession, therefore it belongs to me.” Rather, it goes out of his possession to all his fellow priests.

Explanation
Section one:  If the owner redeems it himself, it reverts to being his possession, and stays that way even after the Jubilee.
Section two: Similarly, if his son redeems it, it goes back to the father, because the son is the eventual inheritor of the land.
Section three: However, if other people, and even other relatives redeem the land, it is theirs only temporarily until the Jubilee at which point it becomes the property of the priests, as is stated in the final verse. 
Section four: If one of the priests redeemed the land before the Jubilee, he is treated just like any other person. It is his until the Jubilee and then it becomes the possession of all the priests. He cannot claim that since he is a priest, at the Jubilee it should become his sole possession.
