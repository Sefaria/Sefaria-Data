Arakhin, Chapter Three, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Today’s mishnah deals with the warned ox, the “muad.” This is an ox that has gored three times. The owner of a “warned ox” that kills a person is liable to pay the value of the person (see Exodus 21:30). However, if the ox kills a slave, he pays 30 shekels no matter the value of the slave (vs. 32).

Mishnah Three 
“The law concerning a warned ox that has killed a slave is sometimes lenient and sometimes strict.” 
How so? Whether it killed the fine looking slave or an ugly slave, he must pay thirty selas.
If it killed a free man he must pay what he is worth. 
If it wounded, whether this one or the other, he must pay the full damage. 

Explanation
Section one: If a warned ox kills a slave, the owner of the ox pays thirty selas (equivalent to the Torah’s shekels) to the slave’s owner, no matter how valuable the slave was. Sometimes this can create a stringency (if the slave was worth less) and sometimes a leniency (if the slave was worth more). 
Section two: As stated in the introduction, if the ox kills a free person, he must pay the value of the person, no matter the how great or small the value is. The fixed amount is only for the slave. 
Section three: The distinction between the slave and the free person is only in case the ox kills one of them. If the ox wounds them, its owner is liable to pay the actual worth in both cases.
