Arakhin, Chapter Five, Mishnah Four

Introduction 
Today’s mishnah deals with a person who vows another person’s worth or value.

Mishnah Four
If he said: “The value of so-and-so is upon me,” if both the vower and the subject of the vow died, then the heirs must pay it. 
[If he said,] “The worth of so-and-so is upon me,” and the vower died, the heirs must pay it.
But if the subject of the vow died, the heirs need not pay anything because dead persons have no worth.

Explanation
Section one: When the vower dies, the heirs of the vower incur the obligation to pay his vow. Even though the subject of the vow died they can pay his value, because the value is fixed and is not dependent upon an evaluation.
Section two: Here the vower dedicated someone else’s worth, which does require an evaluation. If the vower dies before he pays off his debt, the heirs must pay his debt. But if the subject of the vow dies, then the heirs do not owe anything because a dead person has no worth. This is basically the same halakhah that we learned in mishnah two.
