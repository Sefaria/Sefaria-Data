Arakhin, Chapter Two, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
There were never less than twelve levites standing on the platform and their number could be increased into infinity. 
No minor could enter the court of the sanctuary to take part in the service except when the Levites stood up to sing. 
Nor did they join in the singing with harp and lyre, but with the mouth alone, to add flavor to the music.
Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob said: they did not count in the required number, nor did they stand on the platform. Rather they would stand on the ground, so that their heads were between the feet of the levites. And they were called the youth of the Levites.

Explanation
Section one: There always needed to be twelve Levites standing on the platform in the Temple singing. This would mean one for every lyre (nine), one for every harp (two) and one for the cymbals. This number is also referred to in I Chronicles 25:9. 
Section two: Minor Levites would go into the courtyard while the Levites were singing in order to aid them. However, they could only go in while the Levites were singing. 
Section three: The minors only sang. They did not play the harp and lyre.
Section four: There are two versions of this section. The version I have quoted here is one that Albeck seems to prefer. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob is referring to the youth mentioned in sections 1-2. The other version, found in the Rambam’s commentary reads, “trouble-makers of the Levites.” The Rambam explains that this refers to the musicians, those playing the instruments, for they would drown out the beautiful voices of the Levites.
