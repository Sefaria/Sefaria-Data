[this order thus does not apply] unless he is a levite and in the cities of the levites. these are the words of rabbi. the sages say: these things apply only to the cities of the levites. 
	mishnah. one may not turn a field into a city's outskirts,   nor a city's outskirts into a field.   nor a city's outskirts into a city,   nor a city into a city's outskirts.   r. eleazar said: this applies only to the cities of the levites, but in the cities of the israelites one may turn a field into a city's outskirts, but not   a city's outskirts into a field. [one may turn] a city's outskirts into a city, but not a city into a city's outskirts, that they destroy not the cities of israel. the priests and levites may sell [a house] at any time and redeem it at any time, as it is said: the levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption.
