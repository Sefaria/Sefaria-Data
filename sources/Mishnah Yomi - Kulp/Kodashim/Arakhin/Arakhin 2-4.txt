Arakhin, Chapter Two, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah is a continuation of yesterday’s, which discussed the blowing of the flutes on holiday occasions.

Mishnah Four
They were slaves of the priests, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
Rabbi Yose said: they were of families from Bet Hapegarim, Bet-Zipparya and from Emmaus, places from which priests would marry [women].   
Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonos said: they were Levites. 

Explanation
Section one: According to Rabbi Meir, it was slaves owned by priests who would play the flute. 
Section two: Rabbi Yose seems to think that it would not have been appropriate for slaves to fulfill such a function. Rather, people from important families, families whose daughters were able to marry priests (see Kiddushin 4:5), would play the flute. These three locations are in the region of Judea. In face, Emmaus is on my regular bike-riding route (near Latrun). Next time I’m out, I’ll try to listen for some flutists!
Section three: Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says that just as Levites would sing, so too they were the ones to play the flute.
