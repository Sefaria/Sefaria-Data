Arakhin, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two 
If one said: “I will acquire it for ten selas,” and another, “[for] twenty”, and another “for thirty”, and another “for forty”, and another “for fifty”, 
If he [that bid] fifty reneged, they take pledges from his property up to ten selas.   
If he [that bid] forty reneged, they take pledges from his property up to ten selas. 
If he [that bid] thirty reneged, they take pledges from his property up to ten selas. 
If he that bid twenty reneged they take pledges from his property up to ten selas. 
If he that bid ten reneged they sell [the field] for what it is worth, and collect what remains from him who bid ten.   
If the owner bid twenty and any other man bid twenty, then the owner comes first, because he must add one fifth.

Explanation
Section one: In this imaginative scenario there is initially a bidding war for the field, each person upping the previous bid by ten selas. Finally, the bid is won by the person who bid 50 selas. Then all of the bidders begin to renege. The mishnah delineates how the Temple deals with this situation. Note—the idea is that the Temple should collect the highest bid, but that all of those who bid should have to pay something. Basically the Temple takes a pledge from each person equivalent to the amount that he upped the previous bid—ten selas. When they get to the last person, they simply sell the field and then take from him the difference between ten and the sale price. In this way, the Temple collects fifty selas, but no more than fifty selas. 
Section two: If the owner and another person put forth the same bid, the owner’s bid is accepted because he must add an extra fifth. In this way the Temple maximizes its profits.
