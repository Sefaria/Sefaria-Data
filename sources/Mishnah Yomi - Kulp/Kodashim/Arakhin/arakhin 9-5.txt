Arakhin, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five 
Whatever is within the [city] wall is regarded as the houses in a walled city, with the exception of fields. 
Rabbi Meir says: even fields. 
A house built into the wall: 
Rabbi Judah says: it is not considered a house within a walled city. 
Rabbi Shimon says: its outer wall is regarded as its [city] wall.

Explanation
Section one: Anything inside the walled city is governed by the laws regarding houses in the walled city. The first opinion holds that fields are the exception. The implication would be that can be redeemed, if sold, up until the Jubilee year. Rabbi Meir says that even fields within the city must be redeemed within a year, or they become the permanent property of the buyer.
Section two: In thickly walled cities, houses were often built right into the walls. We see this in the Tanakh in connection with Jericho. According to Rabbi Judah these houses are not considered to be within the walled city. Rather they are like houses in a courtyard, a topic which mishnah seven will discuss.
Rabbi Shimon says that the outside wall of the house counts as the wall of the city and therefore these houses are considered part of the city.
