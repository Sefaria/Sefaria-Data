Arakhin, Chapter Four, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our chapter provides several central rules as to how the amount paid for evaluations is determined. We should note that the literary structure of this chapter is the same as that of the previous chapter—the first mishnah gives brief headlines that are further explicated in the rest of the chapter. Therefore, I will again leave the explanation of these headlines for subsequent mishnayot. 

Mishnah Two 
The sufficiency of means is according to the ability of the vower. 
And the age is according to the subject of the vow. 
The evaluation is according to the subject of the evaluation. 
And the evaluations [shall be paid according to the rate prescribed] at the time of the evaluation. 
The sufficiency of means is according to the ability of the vower. 
How so? If a poor man evaluated a rich man, he pays only the valuation of a poor man.  
But if a rich man evaluated a poor man, he must pay the valuation of a rich man.

Explanation
Section five: Leviticus 27:8 states, “But if one cannot afford the evaluation, he shall be presented before the priest and the priest shall assess him; the priest shall assess him according to what the vower can afford.” Our mishnah teaches that this is an assessment of the means of the person who made the vow, and not the person whose value was vowed. So if a poor person vows to give the value of a rich person he only pays the amount that a poor person could afford to pay. This estimate has nothing to do with the fact that the person being evaluated was rich. Conversely, if a rich person vows the value of a poor person, he must pay the full amount because he is rich. It does not matter at all that the person whose value he vowed is poor.
