Arakhin, Chapter Six, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah relates to mishnah 5:6, where we learned that the court take pledges (objects of value) in order to force a person to pay his vows of value.
Today we learn that certain items are not taken by the collector. 

Mishnah Three
Even though they said: they take pledges from those who owe vows of value, they allow him food for thirty days, clothing for twelve months, bed and bedding, shoes and tefillin.   
For himself, but not for his wife and children. 
If he was a craftsman, they leave him two tools of every kind.
If he was a carpenter, they leave him two axes and two saws. 
Rabbi Eliezer says: if he was a farmer, they leave him his yoke [of oxen]. 
If a donkey driver, they leave him his donkey.

Explanation
Section one: When they take the pledge from the person who owes his vow to the Temple, they leave him with certain basic needs, food, clothing and tefillin. However, they don’t leave him with money to support his wife and family. Evidently, those who depend upon him will have to look elsewhere for support. Note that this does not mean that they take his wife’s property. It just means that they don’t leave him with money to buy food for her or his children.
Section two: If he is a craftsman, he is left with two kinds of each of his tools. This way he can continue to make a living to pay off his debt. An example is a carpenter, who is left with two axes and two saws. 
Section three: Rabbi Eliezer adds that if he is a farmer they leave him with a pair of oxen to pull his plow. And if he is a donkey driver, they leave him his donkey. These are considered the tools of the donkey driver or farmer’s trade, just as an ax or saw is the tool of a carpenter’s trade.
