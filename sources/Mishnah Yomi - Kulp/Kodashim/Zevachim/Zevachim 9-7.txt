Zevahim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
The final mishnah of our chapter teaches that the altar is not the only item that sanctifies that which is fit for itâ€”other items in the Temple do so as well. 

Mishnah Seven
Just as the altar sanctifies whatever is eligible for it, so does the ascent sanctify whatever is eligible for it;   
And just as the altar and the ascent sanctify whatever is eligible for them, so do vessels sanctify.  
Vessels for liquids sanctify liquids,  
And the measures sanctify dry material.  
A liquid vessel does not sanctify dry matter, nor does a dry [measure] sanctify a liquid. 
If holy vessels were perforated and they can be used for the same purpose as when whole, they sanctify [what is placed in them]; if not, they do not sanctify. 
And all these sanctify only in the holy place.

Explanation
Section one: The ascent is the ramp that leads up to the altar. If something that is fit for the altar is brought onto the ascent, it is sanctified and cannot be taken down. The same rules that apply to things that ascend onto the altar will apply to the ascent. 
Section two: The ministering vessels, listed in Exodus 30:28-29, also sanctify things that are put in them, as long as they are fit.
Sections 3-5: There are vessels meant to hold liquids, such as wine libations, and there are vessels meant to hold dry measures, such as the minhah (grain) offerings. Each type of vessel only sanctifies the type of material it is meant to hold.
Section six: If there is a hole in one of the vessels but it can still be used for its original purpose, then it still sanctifies that which is put in it. But if it can no longer be used, then it has lost its status as a holy vessel and it does not sanctify that which is put in it. 
Section seven: The sanctifying effect of the vessels is dependent upon their being in the Temple courtyard. If the vessel is taken out of the courtyard, it will no longer sanctify.
