Zevahim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah refers to the cases in the previous two mishnayot of bird hatats and olahs that were not offered correctly. 

Mishnah Three 
And all of these do not defile in the gullet 
And they involve trespass, except the hatat of a bird which was offered below [the red line] with the rites of a hatat [and] in the name of a hatat.

Explanation
Section one: One who eats a bird that was not slaughtered properly becomes impure when the piece of meat he is swallowing reaches his gullet. However, these birds were slaughtered properly (the problem was in the sacrificial ritual) and therefore they do not cause impurity as do carrion birds.
Section two: Trespass refers to illegal use of Temple property. One who uses a bird hatat or olah that was sacrificed improperly has still trespassed and must bring an asham to atone for his sin. The exception is a bird hatat that was offered correctly. At this point a priest can eat from it, and once priests can eat it, non-priests can derive benefit from it, they have not trespassed Temple property. Note that an olah is not eaten by the priests and therefore no one is ever allowed to derive benefit from it.
