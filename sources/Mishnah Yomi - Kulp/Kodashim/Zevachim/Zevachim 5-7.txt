Zevahim, Chapter Five, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Five
The shelamim is a sacrifice of lesser sanctity. 
It may be slaughtered in any part of the Temple court, and its blood requires two sprinklings, which constitute four.
And they are eaten in any part of the city, by any person, prepared in any way, during two days and one night. 
The parts of them which are raised are governed by the same law, save that these are eaten [only] by the priests, their wives, their children and their slaves.

Explanation
Section two: The same rules that governed the slaughtering of the todah in yesterday’s mishnah.
Section three: The difference between the shelamim and the todah is that the shelamim can be eaten for longer. They can be eaten on the day that they are sacrificed, on the entire following night and on the following day. See Leviticus 7:16-17.
Section four: The same rule as we saw in yesterday’s mishnah regarding the todah.
