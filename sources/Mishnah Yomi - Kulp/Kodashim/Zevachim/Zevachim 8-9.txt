Zevahim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Nine

Mishnah Nine
If [blood] that is to be sprinkled below [the red line on the altar] was mixed with blood that is sprinkled above:
Rabbi Eliezer says: he must sprinkle [it] above, and I regard the lower [blood which was sprinkled] above as though it were water, and then he sprinkles again below. 
But the sages say: he must pour it out into the duct.   
If he [the priest] did not ask but sprinkled it, it is valid.

Explanation
Section one: As we have seen in earlier chapters, some sacrificial blood is sprinkled on the altar above the red line that runs through its middle, and some is sprinkled below. In the case in our mishnah, blood from a sacrifice that is sprinkled above, namely a hatat whose blood is sprinkled on the four corners of the altar, is mixed in with blood that is sprinkled below from either an olah, an asham or a shelamim.
Section two: Rabbi Eliezer says that the first thing he should do is sprinkle the blood on the four corners of the altar, as is the rule for the hatat. Then Rabbi Eliezer employs a legal fiction similar to that which we saw him use in earlier mishnayot. The priest can look at the blood that was sprinkled above as if it were water, even though it may have in fact been from the blood that was supposed to be sprinkled below, and what is left in the mixture is blood that is supposed to be sprinkled below. Sprinkling the blood below will also count towards the requirement to pour out the remainder of that hatat blood below (see 5:3).
Section three:  As in all of the previous cases, the rabbis say that this should not be done. All of the mixture should be poured into the duct for disposal.
Section four: This is the same line that appeared at the end of mishnah seven. If the priest did apply the blood above the line, then the application is “ex post facto” valid.
