Zevahim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with blood from a sacrificial animal that becomes mixed up with some other liquid. The question is: can it still be sprinkled on the altar?

Mishnah Six
If blood was mixed with water, if it retains the appearance of blood, it is fit [to be sprinkled on the altar].
If it was mixed with wine, we regard it as though it were water.   
If it was mixed with the blood of a beast or wild animal, we regard it as though it were water.
Rabbi Judah said: blood cannot nullify blood.  

Explanation
Section one: If the blood is mixed with water, it can still be sprinkled on the altar, as long as it is not so watered down that it loses the appearance of blood.
Section two: If the blood is mixed with red wine, then it will have the appearance of blood even if there is mostly red wine. So what we do is we look at the wine as if it were water, and if there is enough wine such that if it were water there would no longer be an appearance of blood, it cannot be used.
Section three: The same is true if the blood is mixed in with the blood of a non-sacrificial beast or a wild animal (that can never be used as a sacrifice). Since this mixture will always have the appearance of blood, we look at the blood of the non-sacrificial animal as if it were water, and if there is enough of this blood such that if it were water there would no longer be an appearance of blood, it cannot be used.
Section four: According to Rabbi Judah like things do not nullify each other. Thus no matter how much blood there was from the non-sacrificial animal, the mixture can still be sprinkled on the altar.
