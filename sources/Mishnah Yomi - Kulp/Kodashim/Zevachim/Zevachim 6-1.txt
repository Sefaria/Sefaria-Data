Zevahim, Chapter Six, Mishnah One

Mishnah One
Most holy sacrifices which were slaughtered on the top of the altar:
Rabbi Yose says: it is as though they were slaughtered in the north.
Rabbi Yose son of Rabb Judah says: from the middle of the altar southward is as south, from the middle of the altar northward is as the north.
The fistfuls of meal-offerings were taken in any part of the Temple court, and they [the minhah-offerings] were eaten within the curtains, by male priests, prepared in any manner, on the same day and night, until midnight.

Explanation
Section one: We already learned in the previous chapter that most-holy sacrifices (the olah, hatat and asham) are slaughtered north of the altar. Our mishnah discusses what happens if the priest slaughters one of these sacrifices on top of the altar. 
According to Rabbi Yose this is sufficient to validate the sacrifice, since the top of the altar counts as the north of the altar. 
Rabbi Yose the son of Rabbi Judah divides the altar in halfâ€”if the sacrifice was slaughtered on the northern half, then it is valid, but if on the southern half it is not valid.
Section two: The mishnah has now completed the topic of animal sacrifices and is moving on to other things that are offered in the Temple. Out of minhah offerings (grain) are removed fistfuls of flour and they are burned on the altar (see Leviticus 2:1-3). The removal of the fistful from the minhah can be done anywhere in the Temple court, and not just on the northern side of the altar. The minhah itself (not the fistful) is eaten by male priests (and not their households) within the Temple confines. It can be cooked in any manner, but it must be eaten by midnight of the day it was brought.
