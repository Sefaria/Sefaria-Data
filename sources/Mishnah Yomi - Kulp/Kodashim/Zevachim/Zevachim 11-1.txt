Zevahim, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah One

Introduction
In connection with a hatat, Leviticus 6:20 states, “Anything that touches its flesh shall become holy; and if any of its blood is spattered upon a garment, you shall wash the bespattered part in the holy place.” 
This chapter deals with various details that stem from this verse. Our mishnah deals with the second half of the verse.
 
Mishnah One
If the blood of a hatat spurted on to a garment, it must be washed.  
Though scripture speaks only of [hatats] which are eaten, for it is said, “In the holy place shall it be eaten,” (Leviticus 6:19), yet both those which may be eaten and the inner [sacrifices] necessitate washing, for it is said, “[This is] the law of the hatat” (Leviticus 6:18), there is one law for all hatats.

Explanation
Section one: As the second half of verse 20 states, if blood from a hatat splatters onto a piece of clothing, the piece of clothing must be washed. 
Section two: The mishnah clarifies that verse 20 speaks about all hatats, both those that are eaten by the priests and those that are offered inside the Sanctuary on the golden altar and are not eaten (see 5:1-2). Although verse 19 seems to refer only to hatats that are eaten, since verse 18 refers to all hatats, the rules that are in verse 20 are understood as referring to all hatats as well.
