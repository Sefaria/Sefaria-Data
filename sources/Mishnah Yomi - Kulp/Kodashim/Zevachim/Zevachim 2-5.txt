Zevahim, Chapter Two, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
[If one intended] to eat as much as an olive on the next day [and] as much as an olive on the outside its intended place, [or] as much as an olive outside its designated place [and] as much as an olive on the next day;   
Half as much as an olive on the next day [and] half as much as an olive outside its designated place; 
Half as much as an olive on the next day [and] half as much as an olive outside its designated place, 
[The sacrifice] is unfit, and does not involve karet.   
Rabbi Judah said: this is the general rule: where the [improper] intention of time precedes the [improper] intention of place, [the sacrifice] is piggul, and involves karet; but if the [improper] intention of place precedes the [improper] intention of time, it is invalid and does not involve kareth.  
But the sages say: in both cases [the sacrifice] is invalid and does not involve karet. 
[If one intends] to eat half as much as an olive [after its intended time or outside its intended place] [and] to burn half as much as an olive [similarly] it is valid, for eating and burning do not combine. 

Explanation
Section one: The priest performs the sacrifice with the intention of first eating part of it on the wrong day, and then he has the intention of eating part of it outside its designated place, or vice versa. Alternatively, he has one type of improper intention with half of an olive’s worth of the sacrifice and then another type of improper intention with the other half. Note in all of these cases he has mixed between the two types of improper intention—wrong time and wrong place. The sacrifice is invalid, because the two half-olives combine since they were both offered with the wrong intention. However, in none of the cases is there karet for eating the sacrifice because the penalty of karet is only for piggul, and for something to be piggul, the problematic intent must be solely that of eating it after its designated time. Having the intent of eating it in the wrong place takes it out of the category of karet.
Section two: Rabbi Judah says that the order of the wrong intentions is critical. If the improper intention of time precedes the improper intention of place, then the sacrifice is piggul because the second improper intention does not affect the first improper intention. However, if the first improper intention is place and then he has an improper intention of time, the sacrifice is not piggul. 
Section three: The sages, whose opinion is found in section one, say that the order doesn’t matter. For something to be piggul, the improper intention must have been only that of time.
Section four: In section one we learned that if one has one type of improper intention with one half of an olive’s worth of meat and the other type of improper intention with the other half, then the two half-olives’ worth of meat join together to prohibit the sacrifice. Here we learn that if the priest intends to eat one half of an olive’s worth at either the wrong time or place and burn another half of an olive’s worth at either the wrong time or place, the two half-olives do not join together to create a prohibition. While two types of wrong intention can join together, improper intentions to do different things, burn and eat, do not join together.
