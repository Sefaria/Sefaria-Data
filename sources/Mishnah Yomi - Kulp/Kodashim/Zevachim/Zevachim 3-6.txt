Zevahim, Chapter Three, Mishnah Six

Introduction
In this mishnah we learn that usually only two types of illegitimate intentions can invalidate a sacrifice—the intention of eating it outside the prescribed place of after the prescribed time. Other illegitimate intentions do not render the sacrifice invalid.

Mishnah Six
If he slaughtered it with the intention of leaving its blood or its innards for the next day, or of carrying them outside of their place: 
Rabbi Judah disqualifies [it], 
But the sages declare it valid. 
[If he slaughtered it] with the intention of sprinkling [the blood] on the ascent, [or on the altar] but not against its base; or of applying below [the scarlet line] what should be applied above, or above what should be applied below, or without what should be applied within, or within what should be applied without; 
[Or with the intention] that unclean [persons] should eat it, [or] that unclean [priests] should offer it;  
[Or] that uncircumcised [persons] should eat it, [or] that uncircumcised persons should offer it; 
[Or with the intention] of breaking the bones of the pesah, or eating of it before it is roasted;  
Or of mingling its blood with the blood of invalid [sacrifices];
[In all of these cases] it is valid, because an [illegitimate] intention does not disqualify [a sacrifice] except when it refers to after its time or outside its prescribed place, and [in the case of] a pesah and a hatat, [the intention to slaughter them] for the sake of their being a different sacrifice.

Explanation
Section one: The person sacrificing had the intention of leaving the blood or the innards that must be burned on the altar for the next day, but he was not thinking that he would sprinkle the blood on the next day or burn the innards on the next day. Alternatively, he had the intention of taking the blood or innards to a place outside of where they must be spilled or burned, but not of offering them up there. According to Rabbi Judah this is sufficient to disqualify the sacrifice. Just as leaving them over for the next day or taking them out of their prescribed place disqualifies them, so too does thinking about doing such a thing. The rabbis however disagree. Since he did not have the intention of burning or eating after the prescribed time or outside the prescribed place, the sacrifice is not invalid. 
Section two: The mishnah now brings a long list of cases where a person has the intention of doing an action that will render the sacrifice invalid, but his intention is not to burn or eat the sacrifice after the prescribed time or outside the prescribed place. Section seven will state that in only of these cases the sacrifice is valid.
The first list is the same as that found in 2:1—spilling the blood in the wrong place.
Section three: The second wrong intention is giving it to an impure person, who cannot eat sacrificial meat.
Section four: Uncircumcised men cannot eat sacrifices.
Section five: The bones of the pesah cannot be broken and it must be eaten wholly roasted. See Exodus 12:9, 46. 
Section six: If the blood of a valid sacrifice is mixed with the blood of an invalid sacrifice, the sacrifice cannot be eaten. 
Section seven: In all of these cases the sacrifice is valid because his improper intention was not connected with eating or burning it outside the prescribed place or after the prescribed time, the improper intention that does render a sacrifice invalid. The only other improper intention that can render a sacrifice invalid is if the sacrifice is a pesah or a hatat and the person offering it sacrifices it thinking that they are other sacrifices (see 1:4).
