Zevahim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with blood from a valid sacrificial animal that is mixed up with other blood.

Mishnah Seven
If it was mixed with the blood of unfit [animals], it must be poured out into the duct.  
[If it was mixed] with the blood that came out after death, it must be poured out into the duct.
Rabbi Eliezer declares it fit. 
If he [the priest] did not ask but sprinkled it, it is valid.

Explanation
Section one: In this case the blood of the fit animal is mixed up with blood from an animal that either cannot be sacrificed or was sacrificed and became unfit at some point during the sacrificial procedure. It is forbidden to sprinkle blood from such an animal on the altar. Therefore, all of this blood must be poured into the aqueduct that flows through the Temple courtyard. This aqueduct was used to clean out the Temple, so putting blood there is akin to throwing it in the garbage.
Section two: The blood that is sprinkled on the altar is the blood that spurts out of the animal as the animal is dying. This is the “life-blood” for it is the blood that carries the animal’s life force. Blood that seeps out after the animal has already died is not sprinkled on the altar. So according to the first opinion, if the life-blood that was supposed to be used is mixed in with this post-mortem blood, it all must be poured into the duct. 
Rabbi Eliezer allows this blood to be used, at least in this case when it was accidentally mixed in with the valid life-blood.
Section three: If the priest didn’t ask what to do in any of these cases, and just went ahead and sprinkled a mixture of valid and invalid on the altar, then his sprinkling is valid. According to the Tosefta, it is valid only if the invalid blood is not of sufficient quantity such that if it were water it would cause the mixture to lose the appearance of blood (see yesterday’s mishnah).
