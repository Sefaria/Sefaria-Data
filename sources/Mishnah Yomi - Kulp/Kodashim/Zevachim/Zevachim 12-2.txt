Zevahim, Chapter Twelve, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah teaches that the priests have the right to the hide of a sacrifice only if the flesh of the sacrifice was burned on the altar.

Mishnah Two
Whenever the altar does not acquire its flesh, the priests do not acquire the hide, for it is said, “[And the priest that offers] any man’s olah [the priest shall have . . . the hide]” (Leviticus 7:8), [this means,] an olah which went up on the altar on behalf a man.  
If an olah was slaughtered under a different designation, although it does not count for its owner, its hide belongs to the priests. 
Whether [it be] a man’s olah or a woman's olah, the hide belong to the priests. 

Explanation
Section one: If for some reason the flesh of the sacrifice cannot be burned on the altar, for instance it was sacrificed with a disqualifying intention, then the priests also don’t acquire the hides. This is learned from a midrash on Leviticus 7:8 which implies that when the priest successfully sacrifices a person’s olah, then he gets to keep the hide. Only if the olah is actually put on the altar, does the priest receive the hide.
Section two: If the olah was slaughtered with the intent of it being a different sacrifice, it can be put on the altar, even though it does not discharge the owner of his obligation (see 1:1). Since it can be put on the altar, the priest does receive the hide. 
Section three: Even the Torah says, “man”, the priest receives the hide of the sacrifice whether it was brought by a man or a woman. The word “man” in this context was not meant to exclude a woman.
