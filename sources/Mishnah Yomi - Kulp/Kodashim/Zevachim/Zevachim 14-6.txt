Zevahim, Chapter Fourteen, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
When they came to Shiloh, bamot were forbidden. 
[The Tabernacle] there had no roof, but [consisted of] a base of stones with a ceiling of curtains, and that was the “resting place” [referred to in the Torah].
Most holy sacrifices were eaten within the curtains, and less holy sacrifices and second tithe   [were eaten] wherever [Shiloh] could be seen.

Explanation
Section one: When they came to Shiloh (see Joshua 18:1) the ark was put back into the Tabernacle (see I Samuel 3:3). At this point bamot were again forbidden because at Shiloh the Tabernacle was considered to be at “rest”, a reference to Deuteronomy 12:9, “Because you have not yet come to the resting place, to the inheritance, that the Lord your God is giving you.” “Resting place” is understood to be Shiloh because the Israelites came to Shiloh after fourteen years spent conquering the land of Israel. Once the Tabernacle came to rest in Shiloh, local altars, bamot, were prohibited. 
Section two: In the desert, the Tabernacle was made of wood. In Shiloh the Tabernacle was made of a base of stones and a roof of curtains.  
Section three: As always, most holy sacrifices were eaten within the curtains of the Tabernacle. Less holy sacrifices and second tithe could now be eaten in any place that could see Shiloh. 
According to the Talmud’s account, the ark was in Shiloh for 369 years.
