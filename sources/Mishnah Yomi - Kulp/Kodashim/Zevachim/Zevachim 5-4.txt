Zevahim, Chapter Five, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Today’s mishnah discusses the olah, the second of the three “most holy sacrifices.”

Mishnah Four
The olah is a most holy sacrifice. 
It is slaughtered in the north, and its blood is received in a ministering vessel in the north; and its blood requires two applications, which are four.  
It had to be flayed, dismembered, and completely consumed by the fire.

Explanation
Section two: The olah, like the hatat and the asham, the other two most holy sacrifices, must be slaughtered on the north side of the altar. Its blood must be received in a ministering vessel. The priest then takes the blood and while standing on the floor of the Temple (and not on the walkway) he applies two blood applications. Both are on the lower part of the altar, the first on the northeastern corner and the other on the southwestern corner, thus causing the blood to spread in all four directions (see Leviticus 1:5). This is how two applications of blood can be considered four. 
Section three: After the blood has been applied to the altar, the animal is flayed, dismembered and then all of its parts are burnt completely on the altar (see Leviticus 1:6-9).  In English this is called the “wholly burned sacrifice.”
