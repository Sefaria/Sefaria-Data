Zevahim, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with washing a garment or breaking an earthen vessel in the holy place in order to cleanse it from contamination from the hatat.

Mishnah Five
If a garment was carried outside the curtains [of the Tabernacle], it must re-enter, and is washed it in the holy place. 
If it was defiled outside the curtains, one must tear it, then it re-enters, and is washed in the holy place. 
If an earthen vessel was carried outside the hangings, it re-enters and is broken in a holy place. 
If it was defiled outside the curtains, a hole is made in it, then it re-enters and is broken in a holy place.

Explanation
Section one: If the garment which was splattered with the hatat blood is brought out of Temple confines (the Mishnah always uses the term “curtains” which refers to the Tabernacle, even though it clearly means the walls of the Temple), it must be brought back into the Temple and washed there.
Section two: If it is defiled outside the Temple, it cannot be brought back into the Temple because it is prohibited to bring defilement into the Temple. Therefore, he should tear it, and thereby make it no longer susceptible to impurity. Once garments are torn and thereby no longer are “garments” they are pure. Then he can bring it back into the Temple and wash it there.
Section three: Similarly, with regard to the earthen vessel. If it is brought out of the Temple, he should bring it back in and break it inside the Temple.
Section four: And if it becomes impure outside the Temple, he puts a hole in it. This makes it pure because a vessel with a hole in it is no longer usable as a vessel and it thereby becomes pure. Then he can bring it back in and break it inside the Temple.
