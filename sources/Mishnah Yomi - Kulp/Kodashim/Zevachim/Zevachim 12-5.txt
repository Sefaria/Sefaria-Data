Zevahim, Chapter Twelve, Mishnah Five

Introduction
In chapter five mishnayot 1-2 we learned that in certain cases, namely that of certain bullocks and goats, the sacrificial rites are performed on the inner altar. Their blood is spilled on the inner altar. Our mishnah deals with where these sacrifices are burned. 
 
Mishnah Five 
Bullocks which are burned and goats which are burned: when they are burned in fulfillment of their prescribed commandment, they are burned in the ash depository (bet hadeshen), and they defile garments.
But when they are not burned in fulfillment of their commandment, they are burned in the bet habirah and they do not defile garments.

Explanation
Section one: If the bullocks or goats had not been disqualified, then the flesh is burned in the “ash depository” or “bet hadeshen” which was outside of Jerusalem. In addition, one who burns these sacrifices must wash his clothes and any clothes that he touches, see Leviticus 16:28 and Yoma 6:7.
Section two: However, if they were disqualified in some way, then they are burned in a place called “bet habirah.” According to some commentators there are two places that are called “bet habirah” one in the Temple courtyard, and one on the Temple Mount, outside the Temple. If they were disqualified before they left the courtyard, then they would be burned inside the Temple, and if they were disqualified after they left the courtyard, then they would be burned outside the Temple but on the Temple Mount.  
These bullocks and goats do not defile garments—only valid ones are defiling.
