Zevahim, Chapter Fourteen, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight
When they came to Jerusalem, bamot were forbidden and were never again permitted, and that was the ‘inheritance’. 
Most holy sacrifices were eaten within the curtains, and less holy sacrifices and second tithe within the walls [of Jerusalem].

Explanation
Section one: Deuteronomy 12:9 reads, “Because you have not yet come to the resting place, to the inheritance, that the Lord your God is giving you.” As we saw in mishnah six “resting place” refers to Shiloh. “Inheritance” refers to Jerusalem. Once Solomon built the Temple in Jerusalem, local altars were forever thereafter prohibited, even after the destruction of the altar. 
We should note that this mishnah represents an ideology and not an historic fact. There were definitely Jews who offered sacrifices in places other than the Temple, both while the Temple stood and when it was destroyed. The rabbis, at least those speaking in this mishnah, were opposed to this.
Section two: As before, most holy sacrifices must be eaten inside the Temple, whereas less holy sacrifices could be eaten anywhere within the walls of Jerusalem (see also 5:3, 5).
