Zevahim, Chapter Fourteen, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
When they came to Gilgal, bamot (local altars) were [again] permitted.
Most holy sacrifices were eaten within the curtains, and less holy sacrifices [were eaten] anywhere.

Explanation
Section one: When the Israelites crossed the Jordan they came first to Gilgal and they set up the Tabernacle there. However, they didn’t set up camp around the Tabernacle, as they did in the desert. The Tabernacle contained an altar, but the ark was not inside it. At this point it became permitted to offer sacrifices elsewhere. Communal sacrifices and mandatory individual sacrifices (such as the hatat and the asham) were offered in the Tabernacle whereas voluntary individual offerings could be sacrificed at local altars. 
Section two: The most holy sacrifices continued to be eaten within the Tabernacle’s curtains. Lesser sacrifices could now be eaten anywhere, since there was no official encampment.
