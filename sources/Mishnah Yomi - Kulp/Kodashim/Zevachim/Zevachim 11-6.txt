Zevahim, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah teaches the exact same law as was found in yesterday’s mishnah, except that today’s mishnah refers to a copper vessel. Since the law is the same, I refer the reader to yesterday’s mishnah for more commentary.

Mishnah Six
If a copper vessel was carried outside the hangings, it re-enters and is scoured and rinsed in a holy place. 
If it was defiled outside the hangings, it must be broken through, then it re-enters and is scoured and rinsed in a holy place.

Explanation
Section two: In order to purify the copper vessel, he must make a large hole in it, for metal vessels become pure only if large holes are put into them.
