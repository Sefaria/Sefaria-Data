Zevahim, Chapter Four, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah continues to discuss the effect of improper intentions had when sprinkling the blood.

Mishnah Two
With regard to any [blood] which is sprinkled on the inner altar, if [the priest] omitted one of the applications, he has not atoned; therefore if he applied all in the proper manner but one in an improper manner, it [the sacrifice] is invalid, but does not involve karet.

Explanation
When it comes to sacrifices whose blood must be spilled on the altar inside the sanctuary (the golden altar), all of the sprinklings must be applied and if any one is skipped atonement is not effected. This differs from those sacrifices whose blood is spilled on the outer altar (see yesterdayâ€™s mishnah).
Since all of the applications of the blood are mandatory, if any one of them is done with the wrong intention, the sacrifice is invalid. However, the sacrifice is not piggul and one who eats it is not obligated for karet unless all of the applications were done with the improper intent. If any one of the mandatory applications was done with the correct intent, the sacrifice is not piggul, although it cannot be eaten.
