Zevahim, Chapter Five, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah deals with two sacrifices: the bullocks and the goats that were wholly-burned. These sacrifices were explained above in chapter four, mishnah four. 
As far as how they were sacrificed, these sacrifices, both of which are an olah, are treated basically the same as the two sacrifices discussed in yesterday’s mishnah. 

Mishnah Two
As for the bullocks which were burnt and the goats which were burnt, their slaughtering is [done] at the north, and the reception of their blood is [done] at the north, and their blood requires sprinkling on the veil, and on the golden altar;
[The omission of] a single one of these applications invalidates [the sacrifice]. 
He [the priest] pours the remainder of the blood on the western base of the altar; but if he did not pour it out, he did not invalidate [the sacrifice]. 
Both of these were burnt at the ash pit.

Explanation
Sections one-three: For an explanation, see yesterday’s mishnah. The one difference between these two sacrifices and the Yom Kippur sacrifices in yesterday’s mishnah are that those mentioned in today’s mishnah do not require sprinkling the blood on the altar.
Section four: All of the sacrifices mentioned in this mishnah and in yesterday’s are burned at the ash pit, outside of the camp of Israel, a place mentioned in Leviticus 6:4.
