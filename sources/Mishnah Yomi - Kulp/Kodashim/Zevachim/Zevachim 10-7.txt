Zevahim, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah discusses how the sacrifices that priests eat are to be prepared. It is brought here because the debate between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon is tangentially related to the debate between the sages and Rabbi Shimon in yesterdayâ€™s mishnah.

Mishnah Seven
And in all of these, the priests may deviate in how they eat, and eat them roasted, stewed or boiled. 
And one may season them with hullin spices or terumah spices, the words of Rabbi Shimon. 
Rabbi Meir says: one should not season them with terumah spices, so as not to bring terumah to unfitness. 

Explanation
Section one: The priest(s) eating the sacrifice may choose to prepare the meat in any way they wish. There are no restrictions as to how the meat can be eaten.
Section two: According to Rabbi Shimon, the priest may spice his sacrificial meat with either sacred (terumah) or non-sacred (hullin) spices. 
Section three: Rabbi Meir points out that by spicing his sacrificial meat with terumah spices, the priest might cause the terumah to become unfit for eating. This is because there is a time limit as to how long any sacrifice can be eaten, be it the day it is slaughtered and the following night, or the following night and day. If he spices the meat with terumah, then the spices will absorb some of the taste of the meat. Since they have the taste of the meat, they will be restricted with regard to how long they can be eaten, just as the meat was restricted. Once past this time, they will need to be burned, the same rule that applies to the meat. Thus, by spicing his sacrifice with terumah he may cause terumah to have to be burned, and this is prohibited. Rabbi Meir rules, therefore, that the priest should not use terumah to season his sacrificial meal.
