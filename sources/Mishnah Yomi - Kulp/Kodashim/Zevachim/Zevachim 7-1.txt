Zevahim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah One

Introduction
In chapter six, mishnayot five and six we learned how the bird hatat and bird olah were offered. There were a few differences between them. The first two mishnayot of this chapter discuss what happens if one mixes up between the two of them. 

Mishnah One
If a hatat of a bird is offered below [the red line] with the rites of a hatat [and] for the sake of a hatat, it is fit. 
[If it is offered] with the rites of a hatat, [but] in the name of a olah; 
[Or] with the rites of an olah [and] in the name of a hatat; 
Or with the rites of an olah [and] in the name of an olah, it is unfit. 
If he offers it above [the red line] [even] with the rites of any of these, it is unfit.

Explanation
Section one: The blood of the hatat is supposed to be offered below the red line. In this case the bird hatat is offered in the correct manner, and is therefore fit. This line is only here in the mishnah to serve as a contrast with the following four sections.
Section two: If the rites followed are those for a hatat, but his intention was for it to be an olah, the sacrifice is unfit.
Section three: If the intent of the priest is for it to be a hatat, but he sacrifices it using the rites for an olah, then it is unfit.
Section four: If the sacrifice is supposed to be a hatat, but the priest thinks and acts as if it is an olah, it is similarly unfit. Basically for the hatat to be fit, it must be offered for the sake of a hatat and with the rites of a hatat.
Section five: If he sprinkles the blood above the red line, then it is invalid even if he offers it for the sake of a hatat, using the rites of a hatat. Sprinkling the blood below the red line is mandatory and without it the hatat is invalid.
