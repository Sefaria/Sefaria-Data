Zevahim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah is a continuation of Rabbi Shimon’s rule at the end of yesterday’s mishnah, that if a disqualification occurred outside the Temple courtyard, then if the sacrifice is put up on the altar, it should be taken off. The sacrifices that stay on the altar despite their disqualification are ones which became disqualified only some time after they came into the Temple. 

Mishnah Three
Which are the ones whose disqualification did not arise in sanctity: 
An animal which had sexual relations with a woman or with a man, 
or that was the fee of a whore, or [a dog's] exchange; 
or that was kilayim; 
or terefah; 
or an animal born through the caesarean section,
and blemished animals.   
Rabbi Akiva declared blemished animals fit [to remain on the altar if they had already been put up].   
Rabbi Hananya, chief of the priests, said: my father used to push blemished animals off the altar.

Explanation
Section one: All of these animals were disqualified even before they entered the Temple courtyard. Hence, if they are put up on the altar, they must be taken down. The list is explained in 8:1. 
Section two: Rabbi Akiva allows blemished animals to remain on the altar, even though they may have been blemished before they entered the courtyard. Rabbi Hananya, who himself seems to have served in the Temple, says that his father would push blemished animals off the altar. Interestingly, this is another case where the Mishnah does not seem to provide any more authority in Temple matters to priests than it does to non-priests. Rabbi Akiva does not seem to have changed his opinion, despite Rabbi Hananya’s testimony.
