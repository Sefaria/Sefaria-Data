Zevahim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah provides instructions as to how the bird olah was sacrificed. Some of this mishnah does not need explanation, so I have commented only upon the sections that I felt require it. 

Mishnah Five
How was the olah of a bird sacrificed? 
He [the priest] ascended the ramp, and turned to the surrounding walkway, and made his way to the southeast horn. 
There he pinched its head at the back of the neck, and severed it, and drained out its blood on the wall of the altar. 
He took the head, turned the part where it was nipped to the altar, saturated it with salt, and threw it on to the fires [of the altar].   
Then he came to the body, and removed the crop, the feathers, and the entrails that came out of it, and threw them on to the burning place. He tore [the body], but did not sever it in half, but if he did sever it, it is still valid. Then he saturated it [the body] with salt, and threw it on to the fires of the altar.

Explanation
Section three: After having slaughtered the bird by pinching its head off at the back of the neck, the priest severs the head off of the body (see Leviticus 1:15-17). 
Section four: The first thing he takes care of is the head. He drains its blood by turning the point at which it was pinched toward the altar. Then he salts it very well until it is saturated (see Leviticus 2:13). After it has been salted, he can throw the head onto the altar so it can be burned.
Section five: Now he must take care of the body. He removes the parts that are not to be offered on the altar (Leviticus 1:16), the crop, the feathers and the entrails and then he throws them on the “Bet Hamoked”, the burning place where parts of animals that are not burned on the altar are burned. This was on the southern side of the altar. 
He then tears the body at its wings, but he tries not to sever it in half (Leviticus 1:17). Finally, he salts the body and burns it on the altar.
