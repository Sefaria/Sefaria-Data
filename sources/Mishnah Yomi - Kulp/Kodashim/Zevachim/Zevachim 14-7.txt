Zevahim, Chapter Fourteen, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
When they came to Nov and to Givon, bamot were [again] permitted.
Most holy sacrifices were eaten within the curtains, and less holy sacrifices in all of the cities of Israel.

Explanation
Section one: When Shiloh was destroyed and the ark was taken by the Philistines (I Samuel 4) the Tabernacle was set up in Nov (I Samuel 21). And after Nov was destroyed during Saulâ€™s reign (I Samuel 21-22), they brought the Tabernacle to Givon (I Kings 3:4). While the Tabernacle was in Nov and Givon local altars were again permitted. It seems that these were not important central places, as were Shiloh and subsequently Jerusalem. Thus sacrifices could be offered outside of the Tabernacle.
Section two: As was the situation before Shiloh, once Shiloh was destroyed most holy sacrifices must be eaten within the Tabernacle, whereas less holy sacrifices, specifically voluntary offerings, could be eaten anywhere within the cities of Israel. Note that when the Tabernacle was in Gilgal (mishnah five) they could eat anywhere. Once the cities were built they offered sacrifices there.
