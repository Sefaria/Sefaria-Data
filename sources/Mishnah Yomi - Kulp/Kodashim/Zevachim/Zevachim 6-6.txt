Zevahim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Our mishnah teaches that if the priest deviates from some of the above instructions regarding the bird sacrifices, the sacrifice might still be valid. But if he deviates from others, they invalidate the sacrifice. 

Mishnah Six
If he did not remove the crop or the feathers or the entrails which came out of it, or did not dry it with salt, or made any other deviation after he had drained the blood out, it is still valid. 
If he severed the [head of the] hatat or did not sever the olah, it is unfit. 
If he drained out the blood of the head, but not the blood of the body, it is unfit; 
The blood of the body, but not the blood of the head, it is fit.

Explanation
Section one: The general rule here is quite clearâ€”if he makes any changes from the prescribed way of acting after he has drained out the blood, then the sacrifice is still valid.
Section two: However, if he makes some changes before the blood is drained, such as severing the head of the hatar, or not severing the head of the olah, the sacrifice is invalid. It seems that the sacrifice is validated by the blood being drained out, and therefore deviations that occur before that moment can invalidate the sacrifice whereas those that occur after cannot.
Section three: As far as the blood is concerned, the rule is that he must drain the blood out of the body, for that is where most of the blood is. If he does not do so, the sacrifice is invalid. He should also drain the blood out of the head, but if he does not, the sacrifice is still valid.
