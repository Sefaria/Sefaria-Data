Zevahim, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah teaches that when Leviticus 6:20 states, “And if any of its [the hatat] blood is spattered upon a garment, you shall wash the bespattered part in the holy place,” it is only referring to a valid hatat, and not to a disqualified one.

Mishnah Two
The blood of a disqualified hatat does not necessitate washing, whether it had a period of fitness or did not have a period of fitness. 
Which had a period of fitness? One [whose blood] was kept overnight, or was defiled, or was taken out [of the Temple courtyard]. 
Which did not have a period of fitness? One which was slaughtered [with the intention of eating it] after the appropriate time or outside the appropriate bounds; or whose blood was received by unfit persons, and sprinkled by them.

Explanation
Section one: If the blood came from a disqualified hatat, then the garment does not require ritual cleansing (I might advise one to wash it before wearing it again, but that’s not the type of washing referred to here). 
This applies whether or not the hatat was once valid and then became disqualified (“had a period of fitness”) or whether it was disqualified from the minute it was sacrificed (“did not have a period of fitness”). The mishnah now explains these two categories.
Section two: There are three cases where the hatat “had a period of fitness”. First it was sacrificed properly and then: 1) its blood was kept overnight in the Temple courtyard; 2) It was defiled—for instance its flesh was defiled before the blood was sprinkled; 3) The blood was taken out of the Temple courtyard before it was sprinkled on the altar. For more information on these categories see 9:2.
Section three: If the hatat was slaughtered improperly, for instance with the wrong intention, or its blood was received and/or sprinkled by a person not qualified to do so (see 2:1), then the blood never had a period of fitness.
