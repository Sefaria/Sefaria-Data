Zevahim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
Just as they do not descend once they have ascended, so they do not ascend if they have descended. 
And all of these, if they ascended alive to the top of the altar, they must descend. 
An olah which ascended live to the top of the altar, it must descend. 
If one slaughtered it on the top of the altar, he must skin it and dismember it where it lies. 

Explanation
Section one: Once one of the disqualified sacrifices listed in mishnah two is taken off the altar, it cannot be put back on.
Section two: In contrast, if a live animal is put on the altar it may be taken off. The altar only sanctifies sacrifices that have already been slaughtered.
Section three: If an olah is put alive on the altar, it still should be taken off. It should not be slaughtered there, even though all of it will eventually be burned on the altar.
Section four: If, however, one did slaughter the olah on top of the altar, it has now become sanctified and cannot be taken down. It should be skinned and dismembered there on the altar. Then the skin can be removed for burning elsewhere and the pieces can be burned right there on the altar.
