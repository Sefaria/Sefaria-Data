Zevahim, Chapter Ten, Mishnah One

Introduction
The first five mishnayot of this chapter deal with the order in which different sacrifices are offered. There are two general rules, one which we will see in this mishnah and one in the next mishnah.

Mishnah One
Whatever is more frequent than another, takes precedence over the other. 
The daily offerings precede the additional offerings;  
The additional offerings of Shabbat precede the additional offerings of Rosh Hodesh;  
The additional offerings of Rosh Hodesh precede the additional offerings of Rosh Hashanah.
As it is said, “You shall present these in addition to the morning portion of the regular burnt offering” (Numbers 28:23).

Explanation
Section one: This is a general principle that is today often invoked when determining which prayer, or which blessing is recited first (for instance over the matzah on Pesah). As is frequently the case, a principle that plays a large role in later halakhah, has its origins in sacrificial law. 
Sections 2-4: Here, the principle is invoked in connection to the daily offerings and the additional offerings (musaf). A more frequent sacrifice is offered first. 
Section five: This is the proof text that the daily tamid, the morning offering, is offered before the other additional offerings for holidays. The verse implies that the morning offering has already been offered before the other sacrifices are offered. Hence, whatever is more frequent comes first.
