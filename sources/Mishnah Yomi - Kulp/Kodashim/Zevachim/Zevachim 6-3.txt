Zevahim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with the three offerings mentioned at the end of yesterday’s mishnah—the water and wine libations and the extra bird olahs.

Mishnah Three
All who ascended the altar, ascended by the right, then they went round [the altar] and descended by the left, except for these three, who ascended and descended by retracing their steps.

Explanation
The ramp was on the southern side of the altar. Usually a priest would ascend the southern side of the altar and then walk around to the right of the altar, its eastern side, and then turn towards the left, or western side of the altar and make his way back down. In other words, he would arrive at the southeastern corner first and the southwestern corner last.
For things done on the southwestern corner, the priest did not have to circle the entire altar. Rather, he could just go up the left side, immediately arrive at the southwestern corner, and when done come right back. Perhaps this was a traffic-saving device, meant to prevent too many priests from having to circle the entire altar. The problem would be that priests would be walking in opposite directions, but I guess they somehow managed that problem.
