Zevahim, Chapter Three, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
One who slaughters the sacrifice [intending] to eat as much as an olive of the skin, or of the juice, or of the jelly, or of the hardened meat, or of the bones, or of the tendons, or of the horns, or of the hoofs, either after time or out of bounds, it is valid, and one is not liable on their account in respect of piggul, remnant, or uncleanness. 

Explanation
This mishnah teaches that if one has an improper intention to eat a part of the sacrifice that is not normally eaten, then that does not render the sacrifice invalid.
In addition, one who eats any of these things from a sacrifice that was offered with an improper intention has not transgressed the prohibition of “piggul.” If the sacrifice was “remnant,” meaning it was left over beyond the time in which it must be eaten, then one who eats these parts has not transgressed the prohibition of eating remnant. 
Finally, if these parts become impure or he is impure and he eats them, he has not transgressed the prohibition of eating impure sacrifices, or eating pure sacrifice while impure (see Leviticus 7:19-20).
In short, when it comes to sacrificial eating laws, these parts of the animal do not count as “meat.”
