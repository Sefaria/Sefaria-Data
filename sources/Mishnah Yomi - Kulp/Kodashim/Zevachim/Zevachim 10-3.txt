Zevahim, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
A first-born precedes tithe, because its sanctity is from the womb, and it is eaten by priests. 
Tithe precedes bird [-offerings] because it is a slaughtered sacrifice, and part of it is most sacred: its blood and innards.  

Explanation
Section one: If a priest has a first-born and a tithe to sacrifice, he first sacrifices the first-born because it has greater sanctity than the tithe for two reasons: 1) it is sacred as soon as it is conceived, whereas the tithe has to wait until it is counted as a tenth animal to become sacred; 2) The first-born is eaten only by priests, whereas the tithe can be eaten by anyone.
Section two: Tithe is sacrificed before either of the bird-offerings (olah and hatat) for two reasons: 1) It is a slaughtered whereas bird-offerings are nipped. Also, there are various sacrifices for which there is a sliding-scale: a rich person brings a bullock, a person of medium wealth brings a sheep or goat and a poor person brings a bird. Hence, a bird is a lesser sacrifice. 2) Part of the tithe is burned on the altar—namely its blood and innards (emurim), the same way that parts of a most holy sacrifice are burned on the altar. In contrast, although the bird hatat and olah are most holy sacrifices, only the innards of the bird hatat are put on the altar. The entire bird olah is burned on the altar, and therefore one would think that the bird olah should take precedence over the tithe. But because the bird olah takes precedence over the bird hatat (as we shall see in tomorrow’s mishnah) the tithe, which definitely precedes the bird hatat, must also precede the bird olah.
