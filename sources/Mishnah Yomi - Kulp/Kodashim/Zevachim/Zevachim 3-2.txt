Zevahim, Chapter Three, Mishnah Two

Introduction
In this mishnah we learn that at certain times a priest may perform one of the sacrificial actions in an invalid manner and yet may afterwards remedy the situation and thereby preserve the validity of the sacrifice.

Mishnah Two
If a fit person received [the blood] and gave [it] to an unfit person, he must return it to the fit one. 
If he received [the blood] in his right hand and transferred [it] to his left, he must return it to his right. 
If he received [it] in a sacred vessel and poured it into a secular [non-sacred] vessel, he must return it to the sacred vessel. 
If he spilled it from the vessel on to the pavement and then collected it, it is fit. 
If [the priest] applied it on the ascent [or on the altar], [but] not against [the altar’s] base; [or] if he applied what should be applied below [the scarlet line] above [it], or what should be applied above, below; or what should be applied within [he applied] without, or what should be applied without, within1 and life-blood is [still] available, a fit [priest] must receive [blood] anew.

Explanation
Section one: A fit priest must receive the blood. Were an unfit person to receive it, the sacrifice would be rendered invalid. But if the fit priest receives the blood and then gives the vessel to an unfit person, the unfit person can give the vessel back to the fit priest and the sacrificial procedure can continue. The mere fact that an unfit person handled the vessel does not automatically render the sacrifice invalid.
Section two: As we learned in 2:1, all of the sacrificial actions must be performed with one’s right hand. If one received the blood with his right hand, but then transferred the vessel to his left, he can then transfer the vessel back to his right. This too has not rendered the entire procedure invalid.
Section three: The same structure works here. He must receive the blood with a sanctified vessel, but if he first receives it with a sanctified vessel and then pours it into a non-sacred vessel, all he has to do is pour the blood back into the sacred vessel and .
Section four: In 2:1 we learned that if the blood pours directly from the neck of the animal onto the floor and he doesn’t receive it in a vessel, the blood cannot be put back into the vessel. Here we learn that if the blood is first put into a sacred vessel, and then it spills onto the floor of the Temple, he can scoop it up and then use it to sprinkle on the altar.
Section five: In all of these cases (these are the same cases mentioned in 2:1) the priest sprinkles the blood on the altar on a place where it should not be sprinkled. If he has no more life-blood then the sacrifice is not valid. But if he has other life-blood, he can go back, get the other life-blood and sprinkle that blood in the appropriate place.
