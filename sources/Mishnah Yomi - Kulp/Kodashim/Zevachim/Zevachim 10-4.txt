Zevahim, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
Birds precede meal-offerings (minhah), because they are blood sacrifices. 
A sinner’s meal-offering precedes a voluntary meal-offering, because it comes on account of sin. 
A hatat of a bird precedes an olah of a bird. 
And it is likewise when he dedicates them.

Explanation
Section one: Meal-offerings are offered by the very, very poor, those who can’t even offer a bird (see Leviticus 5:11). Hence, a bird-offering precedes them. Also, the blood of a bird-offering is sprinkled on the altar, and there is obviously no blood to the meal-offering.
Section two: The sinner’s meal offering (Leviticus 5:11) is brought to atone for certain sins, either various false oaths or bringing defilement into the Temple.  It precedes the voluntary meal-offering because it atones, whereas the voluntary meal-offering does not atone for any sin.
Section three: The rabbis derive from Leviticus 5:8 that the hatat takes precedence over the olah. Note that in 10:2 the mishnah stated that parts of the olah take place to parts of the hatat. That was in reference to parts of animal sacrifices. When it comes to the whole sacrifice, the hatat takes precedence. 
Section four: When a person brings a bird offering as a hatat, he also brings one bird as on olah (Leviticus 5:7). When he separates them and declares which is the hatat and which is the olah, he must first designate the hatat and then the olah.
