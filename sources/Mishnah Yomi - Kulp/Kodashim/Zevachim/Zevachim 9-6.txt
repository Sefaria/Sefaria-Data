Zevahim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
And if any of these sprang off from the altar they are not replaced. 
Similarly, if a coal sprang off from the altar, it is not replaced. 
Limbs that sprang off from the altar: if before midnight, must be replaced, and they involve trespass; after midnight, they are not replaced and do not involve trespass. 

Explanation
Section one: If any item that is not supposed to be taken down from the altar, whether it was one of the list of disqualified sacrifices found in mishnah two, or the hair, bones, sinews etc. referred to in yesterday’s mishnah, is flung off the altar by the power of the fires of the altar, it is not put back on. In other words, if a person used his own power to take them off, then they must be put back on. But if they come off the altar due to some other power, they need not be put back on.
Section two: The same is true for a coal found on the altar—if it comes off on its own, it need not be put back. 
Section three: Up until midnight, the mitzvah to burn the limbs of the sacrifice has not been fulfilled (see Berachot 1:1). Up until this point, the limbs “belong” to the altar, if you will. Therefore, if they come off on their own, they must be put back. Up until this point, one who unintentionally derives benefit from them has trespassed Temple property. After midnight, their mitzvah has been completed and therefore one who derives benefit from them has not trespassed (although he should not do so). If one of the limbs does fall off the altar after midnight, it need not be replaced.
