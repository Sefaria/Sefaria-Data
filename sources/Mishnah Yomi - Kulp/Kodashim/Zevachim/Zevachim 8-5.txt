Zevahim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Five

Introduction
In this mishnah, limbs of unblemished olahs which can be burned on the altar become mixed up with limbs of blemished olahs which cannot be burned on the altar. As in yesterday’s mishnah, Rabbi Eliezer and the other rabbis debate. 

Mishnah Five 
Limbs of [unblemished olahs which were mixed up] with the limbs of blemished [olahs]: 
Rabbi Eliezer says: if [the priest] offered the head of one of them, all the heads are to be offered; the legs of one of them, all the legs are to be offered.   
But the sages say: even if they had offered all except one of them, it goes forth to the place of burning.

Explanation
All of the sages agree that what he should do is take all of the flesh out to the place of burning, where disqualified sacrifices are disposed (this is not the altar). The debate is over what to do if some of the limbs have already been burned on the altar.
Rabbi Eliezer says that if he already burned a head on the altar and then realized the situation, then we can suppose that that head was from the blemished animal and all of the rest of the heads can be offered on the altar, with the assumption that they were from the unblemished animals. The same is true for the other limbs—once one has been burned on the altar all of the rest of the same type of limb can be burned.
The other sages disagree and say that we can never assume that the already burned limbs were from the blemished animal. We must always be concerned that the flesh that has not yet been burned is from the blemished animal. Therefore, all remaining flesh must be taken out to the burning place and burned there.
