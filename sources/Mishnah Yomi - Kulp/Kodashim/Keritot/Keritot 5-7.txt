Keritot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
In today’s mishnah, we find on the person’s plate two pieces of forbidden fat, one consecrated and one unconsecrated. The plot thickens!

Mishnah Seven
If there was a piece of unconsecrated forbidden fat and a piece of consecrated forbidden fat, and a person ate one of them and does not know which, he is liable to a hatat. 
Rabbi Akiva says: also to an asham talui. 
If he then ate the second piece, he is liable to two hatats and one certain asham. 
If he ate one piece and another came and ate the other, each of them is liable to a hatat. 
Rabbi Akiva says: each of them brings [in addition] an asham talui. 
Rabbi Shimon holds: each of them brings a hatat and together they bring one asham. 
Rabbi Yose: two people cannot bring one asham.

Explanation
Section one: We know that this person has eaten forbidden fat, so he definitely must bring a hatat. According to the first opinion, that is all that he brings. According to Rabbi Akiva he also brings an asham talui for doubtful sacrilege. This has been Rabbi Akiva’s position since mishnah two.
Section two: If he ate the second piece in a second period of unawareness, he is liable for two hatats, one for each piece of forbidden fat. He is also liable for an asham for the sacrilege. 
Section three: Both people are liable for a hatat for eating forbidden fat. According to Rabbi Akiva, they are both also liable for an asham talui for doubtful sacrilege. Rabbi Shimon says that they can bring one certain asham jointly whereas Rabbi Yose says that this is not possible. This is the same debate we have seen over and over since mishnah four.
