If a man set apart two sela's   for a asham and brought therewith two rams for a asham, if one was of the value of two sela's,   it may be offered for his asham, and the other must be left to pasture   until it becomes blemished when it is sold and its price goes to the fund for freewill-offerings. If he had bought with the money two rams for ordinary use,   one worth two sela's and the other worth ten zuz,   that which is worth two sela's shall be offered for his asham   and the other for his trespass.   [if he had bought with the money] one [ram] for a asham and the other for ordinary use,   if that for the asham was worth two sela's it shall be offered for his asham   and the other for his trespass,   and with it he shall bring a selaâ€™ and its fifth.  
Mishnah. If a man set apart his hatat and then died. His son may not offer it after him.  A man may not offer [what was set apart] for one sin in respect of another sin; moreover. Even if he had set apart [the hatat] for forbidden fat that he had eaten yesterday, he may not offer it for forbidden fat that he has eaten to-day, for it is written, his offering ... For his sin;  the offering must be for that particular sin [for which it was set apart].
Mishnah. One may bring with [money] dedicated to buy a lamb [for a hatat] a goat, or with [what was] dedicated to buy a goat [one may bring] a lamb; or with [what was] dedicated to buy a lamb or a goat [one may bring] turtle-doves or young pigeons;   or with [what was] dedicated to buy turtle-doves or young pigeons [one may bring] the tenth of an ephah.   How is this? Thus if a man set apart [money] for a lamb or a goat and he became poor, he may bring a bird-offering;   if he became still poorer he may bring the tenth of an ephah. If a man set apart [money] for the tenth of an ephah and he became rich, he must bring a bird-offering;   if he became still richer he must bring a lamb or a goat. If   a man set apart a lamb or a goat and they suffered a blemish,   he may if he so wishes   bring with their price a bird-offering; but if he set apart a bird-offering and it suffered a blemish,   he may not bring with its price the tenth of an ephah. Since a bird-offering cannot be redeemed.  
Mishnah. R. Shimon says: lambs come before goats in all places.   You might think that it is because they are choicer,   therefore scripture stated, and if he bring a lamb as his offering,   to teach that both are equal. Turtle-doves come before young pigeons in all places. You might think that it is because they are choicer. Therefore scripture stated, a young pigeon or a turtle-dove for a hatat,   to teach that both are equal. The father comes before the mother in all places. You might think that it is because the honour due to the father exceeds the honour due to the mother, therefore scripture stated, ye shall fear every man his mother and his father,   to teach that both are equal.   But the sages have said: the father comes before the mother in all places, because both a man and his mother are bound to honour the father. And so it is also with the study of the law; if the son has been worthy [to sit] before the teacher, the teacher comes before the father in all places,   because both a man and his father are bound to honour the teacher.
