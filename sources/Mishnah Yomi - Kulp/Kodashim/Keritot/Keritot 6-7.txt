Keritot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah contains some rules governing the hatat. 

Mishnah Seven 
If a man set aside his hatat and then died, his son should not offer it after him.  
A man may not offer [what was set apart] for one sin for another sin.
Even if he had set apart [the hatat] for forbidden fat that he had eaten yesterday, he may not offer it for forbidden fat that he has eaten today, for it is said, “His offering ... for his sin” (Leviticus 4:28)—the offering must be for that particular sin.

Explanation
Section one: If the owner of a hatat has died, the animal cannot be offered, not even by his son. Rather, it must be left to die (see Temurah 2:2).
Section two: If an animal was set aside to be a hatat for one sin, he cannot offer it for another sin, even if it is the same sin, such as eating helev. This is derived from a midrashic reading of Leviticus 4:28.
