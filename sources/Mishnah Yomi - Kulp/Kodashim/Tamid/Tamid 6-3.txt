Tamid, Chapter Six, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
The one who had won the right to the incense took the dish from the middle of the spoon and gave it to his friend or his relative. 
If some of it spilled into the spoon, he would put it into his hands. 
They used to instruct him: Be careful not to begin immediately in front of you or else you may burn yourself.   
He then began to scatter the incense and [after finishing] went out. 
The one who burned the incense did not do so until the superintendent said to him: burn the incense. 
If it was the high priest who burned: he would say to him: Sir, high priest, burn the incense. 
Everyone left and he burned the incense and bowed down and went out.

Explanation
Section one: The chapter concludes with the burning of the incense. The priest who held the incense takes the incense dish out of the large spoon and gives the spoon to a fellow priest or a related priest who had entered with him.
Section two: Any incense that had spilled into the large spoon, he would gather up into his hands.
Section three: He was warned not to scatter the incense first on the side immediately in front of him, because he would burn himself as he tried to scatter the incense on the other side of the altar. Very interesting to note how concerned the rabbis were with fire safety! 
Section four: Rather, he would scatter the incense first on the side opposite from him, and then on the close side. When he was done, he would go out.
Section five: The priest who would scatter the incense did not begin to do so, until told by the superintendent that he could begin. If he was speaking to the high priest, he would address him with some extra respect.
Section six: All of the priests would leave the area between the altar and the Sanctuary while the incense was being offered, because it is forbidden for anyone to be there at this time (see Leviticus 16:17).
