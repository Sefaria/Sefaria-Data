Tamid, Chapter Three, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Before the sacrifices were offered, they had to make sure that it was light outside. 

Mishnah Two
He then said to them: Go out and see if it is yet time for the slaughter. 
If the time had come, the one who saw would say, “There are flashes.”  
Matya ben Samuel says: [He used to say] Has the whole of the east [of the sky] lit up. as far as Hebron? 
And he [the observer] would answer yes.

Explanation
Section one: The morning sacrifice could only be sacrificed after it was light. From the chamber of hewn stone they would send someone out to see if it was light outside. 
Note that this process is not simply the practical issue of sending someone out to see if it was yet light outside. The process is highly ritualized—the mishnah tells the priests what to say (“There are flashes!”) or provides them with ritualized questions to ask.
Section two: Matya ben Samuel was himself the “superintendent” so his testimony here is not just about what was said at this point, but rather what he himself used to say.
