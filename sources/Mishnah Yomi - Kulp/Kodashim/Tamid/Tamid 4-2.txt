Tamid, Chapter Four, Mishnah Three

Introduction
The mishnah now describes in detail how the tamid was flayed. I think that most of this mishnah is self-explanatory, especially after it has been translated. The flaying is described in great detail, because it was an important part of the sacrificial process. Today, when most of us are greatly-distanced from the sources of the meat that we eat (or don’t eat), we might forget that cows don’t magically turn into steaks and hamburgers. The mishnah is a good reminder that inside a cow, or sheep or any animal, are internal organs that need to be removed, and for sacrifice, cleaned, before they can be put on the altar. 

Mishnah Three
He did not use to break the leg, but he made a hole in it at the [knee-] joint and suspended it from there. 
He then began to flay it until he came to the breast.  
When he came to the breast he cut off the head and gave it to the one who merited [bringing it onto the ramp]. 
He then cut off the legs [up to the knees] and gave them to the one who merited [bringing them onto the ramp]. 
He then finished the flaying.
He tore out the heart and squeezed out the blood in it.  
He then cut off the forelegs and gave them to the one who merited [bringing them onto the ramp].
He then went back to the right leg and cut it off and gave it to the one who merited [to bring it onto the ramp], and the two testicles with it. 
He then tore it [the remaining carcass] open so that it was all exposed before him. 
He took the fat and put it on top of the place where the head had been severed. 
He took the innards and gave them to the one to who had merited washing them. 
The stomach was washed very thoroughly in the washing chamber, while the entrails were washed at least three times on marble tables which stood between the pillars.
