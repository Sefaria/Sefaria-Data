Tamid, Chapter Two, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
He then arranged a large pile on the east side of the altar, with its open side on the east, while the inner ends of the [selected] logs touched the ash heap. 
Spaces were left between the logs in which they kindled the brushwood.

Explanation
Section one: They now begin to arrange the logs on the altar. They begin with a large pile of logs on the eastern side of the altar. In tomorrowâ€™s mishnah we shall see that there was a smaller pile on the other side for burning the incense. The open side of the large pile faced east. The logs were arranged in straight rows from east to west, with the ends of the logs on the eastern side. 
Section two: They left spaces in between the logs into which they put brushwood for kindling. Anyone who has ever made a good campfire should be familiar with this practice.
