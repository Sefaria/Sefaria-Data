Tamid, Chapter Three, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
They went into the chamber of the vessels and they took out ninety-three vessels of silver and gold. 
They gave the animal for the daily sacrifice a drink from a cup of gold.  
Although it had been examined on the previous evening it was now examined again by torchlight.

Explanation
Section one: They then went into the chamber of vessels to take out all 93 (!) vessels that would be used during the dayâ€™s worship.
Section two: While it might be tempting to think that they gave the animal a drink out of kindness. In reality the drink was so that its hide would be easier to strip after it was slaughtered.
Section three: They would then reexamine the animal to make sure that it did not have a blemish that would disqualify it from being used as a sacrifice.
