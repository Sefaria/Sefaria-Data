Tamid, Chapter One, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three 
He took the key and opened the small door, and went from the fire chamber into the Temple courtyard, and the priests went in after him carrying two lighted torches. 
They divided into two groups, one of which went along the portico to the east, while the other went along it to the west. 
They went along inspecting until they came to the place where the griddle-cakes were made.   
There the two groups met and said, Is all well (shalom)? All is well (shalom)!   
They then appointed they that made the griddle-cakes to make griddle-cakes.

Explanation
Section one: After waking them up, the superintendent would take the key and open the small door in the fire chamber that was connected to the courtyard. The regular gates to the courtyard did not open until it began to be light outside. The priests then entered the courtyard each carrying two torches.
Section two: They then divided into two groups to check the Temple to make sure that everything was still in its proper place.
Section three: Each day the high priest would offer a tenth of an ephah of griddle cakes, half in the morning and half in the evening (see Leviticus 6:13-14; Menahot 4:5). They would end their examination at the place where these cakes were made and each group would ask the other if everything was okay. They would then formally appoint those who made the griddle-cakes to make the griddle-cakes.
