Tamid, Chapter Five, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Our mishnah describes the ladle and spoon that held the incense.

Mishnah Four
The one who had been selected to offer the incense took up the ladle, which was in shape like a big tarkav of gold, and it held three kavs, 
And the [small] dish was in the middle of it, heaped up with incense.
This had a covering, over which was spread a piece of cloth. 

Explanation
Section one: The ladle which cradled the incense spoon was shaped like a big tarkav (a basket—see 3:6) and it could hold up to three kavs.
Section two: The small dish was placed in the middle of the tarkav, heaped up with incense. It was placed inside the larger basket so that the incense wouldn’t spill over and get lost.
Section three: The dish was covered, and there was a small piece of cloth over the cover. All of this was done to keep the precious incense from getting lost.
