Tamid, Chapter Three, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
He said to them: Go out and bring a lamb from the chamber of lambs. 
Now the lamb’s chamber was in the north-western corner. 
And there were four chambers there — the chamber of lambs, the chamber of the seals, the chamber of the fire-room and the chamber where the showbread was prepared.

Explanation
Section one: After having cast the lots, the first thing done was to fetch a lamb to use for the morning tamid. 
Section two: There were four chambers in the north-western corner of the Temple. My personal favorite is the chamber of the seals. Here the priests would teach the seals all sorts of tricks, like how to bounce a ball on your nose, how to clap your fins and most importantly, how to wave at the crowd when the show is over. I wonder where they kept the chamber of the little fish . 
[Seriously, the seals were used to stamp the libation offerings so that the priests would easily know which libation goes with which offering. See Shekalim 5:3]
