Tamid, Chapter Three, Mishnah One

Introduction
The altar is heating up and ready to go. Itâ€™s now time to start figuring out who is going to do what in the Temple that day.

Mishnah One
The superintendent then said to them: come and cast lots, to see who is to slaughter, and who is to sprinkle the blood, and who is to clear the ashes from the inner altar, and who is to clear the ash from the candlestick, and who is to lift the limbs on to the ascent: the head, the right leg, the two forelegs, the tailbone, the left leg, the breast and the neck and the two flanks, the entrails, the fine flour, the griddle cakes and the wine.  
They cast lots and whoever won, won.

Explanation
The mishnah simply lists what were the parts of the sacrificial process that were up for grabs during this lottery. Many of these actions will be further explained below, so I will not explain them now.
