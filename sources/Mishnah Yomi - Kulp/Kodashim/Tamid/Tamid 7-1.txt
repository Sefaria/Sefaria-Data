Tamid, Chapter Seven, Mishnah One

Mishnah One
When the high priest went in to bow down, three priests supported him, one by his right and one by his left and one by the precious stones.  
When the superintendent heard the sound of the footsteps of the high priest as he was about to go out [from the Sanctuary], he raised the curtain for him. 
He went in, bowed down and went out, and then his fellow priests went in and bowed down and went out.

Explanation
Section one: The high priest would then go in to the Sanctuary. He would have three priests supporting him, one on each side and one who would hold on to the precious stones embedded either in his vest or in the breastplate. 
Section two: It’s good to be the high priest—he even gets the superintendent to lift up the curtain before he comes out! [By the way, does anyone else picture the superintendent with a giant ring of keys, low hanging pants, without a belt and a cigarette hanging out of the side of his mouth?].
Section three: After the high priest has come out, the superintendent goes in, bows, and then goes out. Finally, all of the other priests take their turn and go in, bow down and go out.
