Tamid, Chapter Two, Mishnah One

Mishnah One
When his fellow priests saw that he had descended, they came running and hastened to wash their hands and feet in the laver. 
They then took the shovels and the forks and went up to the top of the altar. 
The limbs and pieces of fat that had not been consumed since the evening they pushed to the sides of the altar.   
If there was not room on the sides they arranged them on the surround or on the ascent.

Explanation
Section one: When the other priests see that the person who cleared the ashes had descended from the altar, they knew it was their turn to wash their hands and feet.
Section two: Their task was to take the pieces of the sacrifices that had not been consumed the day before and to clear them to the sides of the altar to make room for the wood they were now going to burn for the new day’s sacrifices. These limbs and pieces of fat would still burn; they would just do so on the sides of the altar. If there wasn’t enough room on the sides of the altar, they would even take some pieces off of the altar and put them on the ledge surrounding the altar or on the ascent. As we will learn in mishnah five, these pieces were later put back on so that they could be consumed.
