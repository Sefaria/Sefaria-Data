Tamid, Chapter Five, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
He said to them: those who are new to the incense come and draw lots, and who ever won, won. 
He then said: new and old, come and draw lots to see who shall take up the limbs from the ascent to the altar.   
Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: the one who brought the limbs on to the ascent also takes them up to the altar.

Explanation
Section one: The burning of the incense was such a desirable piece of the Temple service that priests were not supposed to perform it more than once in their lives. Thus they would not draw lots to see who would offer the incense. Rather, the superintendent would call the priests who had never done so to come up and take his turn. 
Section two: The limbs of the cut up sacrifice are currently sitting on the ramp/ascent up to the altar. They still need to be placed on the altar. According to the first opinion, there is another lottery to see who merits bringing each piece up. This lottery is open to priests who had performed this act before, as well as new priests. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says that there is no new lottery. Rather, whoever brought the piece up to the ascent, he also gets to bring it up to the altar.
