Tamid, Chapter Three, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
He then came to the small opening on the north. 
The great gate had two small openings, one on the north and one on the south. 
No one ever went in by the openings on the south, about which it is stated explicitly in Ezekiel, “And the Lord said to me, ‘This gate shall be closed, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter by it, for the Lord God of Israel has entered by it” (Ezekiel 44:2).  
He took the key and opened the small opening and went in to the cell and from the cell to the Sanctuary, until he reached the great gate. 
When he reached the great gate he drew back the bolt and the latches and opened it. 
The slaughterer did not slaughter till he heard the sound of the great gate being opened.

Explanation
Section one: The priest who was to open the gates of the Sanctuary would first come to the northern opening on the outside of the great gate.
Section two: The great gate had two openings, but because of the verse in Ezekiel, the southern opening was never used. 
Section three: The priest would open the northern opening (this was described at the end of yesterday’s mishnah) and then he would go in to the cell.  This was a chamber which would open up into the great gate of the Sanctuary. It seems to have been within the thickness of the walls of the great gate.
Section four: The priest would then open the gate of the sanctuary, which was the sign to the priest who was to slaughter the tamid that he could proceed with the slaughtering.
