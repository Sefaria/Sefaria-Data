Meilah, Chapter Four, Mishnah One

Introduction
This chapter deals with when things join together to create the minimum amount necessary for a violation to have been committed or an obligation to be fulfilled. We begin with the issue of sacrilege, but the following mishnayot proceed to other subjects. 

Mishnah One
Things dedicated for the altar combine with one another with regard to the law of sacrilege, and to render one liable over them [for the laws of] piggul, notar and defilement.  
Things dedicated for Temple repair combine with one another.  
Things dedicated for the altar combine with things dedicated for Temple repair with regard to the law of sacrilege.

Explanation
Section one: To be liable for sacrilege one must derive a perutah’s worth of benefit from sacred property. If one derives benefit from several different things dedicated to the altar, and separately each is not worth a perutah, but together they are, he is liable for sacrilege.
They also join together to cause one to be liable for piggul (sacrifices offered with improper intent), notar (remnant) and the prohibition against eating defiled holy things.
Section two: Things dedicated for Temple repair join together only for sacrilege, but not for the other prohibitions, because these prohibitions do not apply to things dedicated for Temple repair (see Temurah 7:1).
Section three: If one has a mixture of things dedicated for the Temple and things dedicated for Temple repair, they can join together to make one liable for sacrilege, because the law of sacrilege applies to them all. However, they do not join together for the other prohibitions, because these prohibitions don’t apply to things dedicated for Temple repair.
