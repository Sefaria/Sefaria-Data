Meilah, Chapter Five, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
The portion which a person has eaten himself and that which he has given his friend to eat, or the portion which he has made use of himself and that which he has given to his friend to make use of, or the portion which he has eaten himself and that which he has given his friend to make use of, or the portion which he has made use of himself and that which he has given his friend to eat can combine with one another even after the lapse of a lot of time.

Explanation
If a person eats half of a perutah’s worth of dedicated food (something subject to the laws of sacrilege), and gives his friend half of a perutah’s worth of dedicated food to eat, the two half-perutah’s join together to cause him to be liable for sacrilege. 
The same is true if he derives half of a perutah’s worth of benefit and he gives his friend half of a perutah’s worth of the dedicated thing. 
The mishnah now goes through all of the various permutations of this law. To put it briefly, benefit and eating can join together, whether they were directly done by the person, or they were given by one person to another.
This is true even if a lot of time lapsed in between the two events. As long as they both occurred in one period of lack of knowledge that the food was dedicated, they can join to make one liable for sacrilege.
