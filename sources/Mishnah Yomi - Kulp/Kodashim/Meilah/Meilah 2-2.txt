Meilah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Today’s mishnah deals with the bird olah, a whole burnt offering. Most of its laws are the same as those found in yesterday’s mishnah. 

Mishnah Two
The law of sacrilege applies to the olah of a bird from the moment of its dedication. 
With the pinching of its neck it becomes susceptible to be disqualified through contact with a tevul yom or one who still requires atonement, or by remaining overnight. 
Once its blood has been squeezed out [onto the walls of the altar] it is subject to [the laws of] piggul, notar and defilement;
And the law of sacrilege applies to it until [the ashes have been] removed [from the altar] to the place of the ashes.

Explanation
Sections one-three: These laws are the same as those found in yesterday’s mishnah. See there for an explanation.
Section four: Since an olah never becomes edible, the laws of sacrilege apply longer than they do to the hatat, which can be eaten by the priests. The flesh is still subject to sacrilege until it is burned and the ashes are removed from the altar and brought out to the “places of ashes” which was outside of the Temple/Tabernacle (see Leviticus 6:4). At this point its mitzvah has been completed and it is therefore no longer subject to the law of sacrilege.
