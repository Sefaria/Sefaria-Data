Meilah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah is very similar to the first two mishnayot of this chapter, except it deals with the bullocks and goats that are burned. There are three types of bullocks that are burned: 1) The bullock offered on Yom Kippur; 2) the bullock offered by a high priest for issuing a mistaken instruction; 3) the bullock offered by the court that makes a mistaken instruction. There are two types of goats that are burned: 1) The goat offered on Yom Kippur; 2) The goat offered by a court for making a mistaken instruction concerning a law related to idol worship.

Mishnah Three
The law of sacrilege applies to the bullocks which are to be burned and the goats which are to be burned from the moment of their dedication. 
Once slaughtered they become susceptible to be disqualified through contact with a tevul yom or one who still requires atonement, or by remaining overnight. 
Once their blood has been sprinkled they are subject to [the laws of] piggul, notar and defilement.
And the law of sacrilege applies to them even while they are at the place of the ashes so long as the flesh has not been charred.

Explanation
Sections 1-3: See mishnayot one and two above for an explanation.
Section four: The law of sacrilege continues to apply to the burned bullocks and goats even after they are brought out to the place of burning. It applies until their flesh has been charred and its appearance has changed. This is when their burning is technically complete (see Zevahim 12:6) and at that point the law of sacrilege no longer applies.
