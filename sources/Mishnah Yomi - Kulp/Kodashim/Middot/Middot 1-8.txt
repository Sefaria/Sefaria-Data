Middot, Chapter One, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah appears word for word in Tamid 1:1. My explanation here is the same as there. 

Mishnah Eight 
The fire chamber was vaulted and it was a large room surrounded with stone projections, and the elders of the clan [serving in the Temple] used to sleep there, with the keys of the Temple courtyard in their hands.
The priestly initiates used to place their bedding on the ground.   

Explanation
Section one: The fire chamber was vaulted, and surrounded by rows of stones. On these rows of stones the priests serving in the Temple at the time (the Temple guard was split into 24 houses) would sleep, while holding the keys to the Temple courtyard. 
Section four: The young priests did not get to sleep on the rows of stones. They had to put their bedding down on the ground and sleep on the floor.
