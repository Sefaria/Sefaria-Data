Middot, Chapter One, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Today’s mishnah describes the officer in charge of security on the Temple Mount who would go around and check to make sure no one was asleep on his watch. If he found anyone asleep he would beat them, and perhaps even burn their clothes. Don’t ask me what they would do without any clothes!
The mishnah is straightforward (although a bit harsh) and therefore doesn’t really need explanation.

Mishnah Two 
The officer of the Temple Mount used to go round to every watch, with lighted torches before him, and if any watcher did not rise [at his approach] and say to him, “Shalom to you, officer of the Temple Mount, it was obvious that he was asleep. Then he used to beat him with his rod. 
And he had permission to burn his clothes. 
And the others would say: What is the noise in the courtyard? It is the cry of a Levite who is being beaten and whose clothes are being burned, because he was asleep at his watch. 
Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob said: once they found my mother's brother asleep, and they burnt his clothes.
