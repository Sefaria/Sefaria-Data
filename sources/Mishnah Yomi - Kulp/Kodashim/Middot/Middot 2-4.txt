Middot, Chapter Two, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four 
All the walls that were there [in the Temple] were high except the eastern wall, for the priest who burned the red heifer would stand on the top of the Mount of Olives and direct his gaze carefully see the opening of the Sanctuary at the time of the sprinkling of the blood.

Explanation
The red heifer was burned on the Mount of Olives, towards the east of the Temple Mount. The priest who burned it had to see the Sanctuary when he sprinkled the blood. This is how the rabbis interpret Numbers 19:4, “the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the Tent of Meeting.”
Note that the priest would not have been able to see the Sanctuary through the Eastern gate because the floor of the Sanctuary was 22 amot higher than the floor of the Temple Mount, and the Eastern Gate was only 20 amot high. Thus the floor of the Sanctuary was higher than the gate, and therefore, the priest had to see over the wall. That is why they designed this wall to be shorter than the other walls.
