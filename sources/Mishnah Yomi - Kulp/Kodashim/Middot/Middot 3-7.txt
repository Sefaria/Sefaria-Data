Middot, Chapter Three, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Todayâ€™s mishnah deals with the doorway that opened onto the Porch (Oolam in Hebrew).  

Mishnah Seven
The doorway of the porch was forty cubits high and its breadth was twenty cubits. 
Over it were five main beams of ash [wood]. 
The lowest projected a cubit on each side beyond the doorway. 
The one above projected beyond this one a cubit on each side. 
Thus the topmost one was thirty cubits long. 
There was a layer of stones between each one and the next.

Explanation
Section one: As we noted above in 2:3, the doorway to the Porch was larger than all of the other doorways in the Temple. It was forty cubits high, whereas all other doorways were twenty cubits high. 
Section two: The lowest beam that went over the doorway would have been 22 cubits in breadth. The next was 24, the third was 26, the fourth was 28 and the fifth was thirty cubits long.
Section three: Between each beam there was a layer of stones.
