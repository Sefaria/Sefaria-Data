Middot, Chapter One, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
The fire chamber had two gates, one opening on to the Hel and one on to the courtyard. 
Rabbi Judah says: the one that opened on to the courtyard had a small opening through which they went in to search the courtyard.  

Explanation
Section one: On the northern side of the fire chamber there was a gate opening to the Hel, the corridor that ran outside the courtyard. On the southern side there was a gate opening into the courtyard. 
Section two: Every morning they would check the courtyard to make sure everything was in its proper place. This procedure was described in Tamid 1:3. The gate to the courtyard had a small opening through which they would enter the courtyard.
