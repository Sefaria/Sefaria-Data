Middot, Chapter Five, Mishnah One

Introduction
Chapter five backs away from the Hekhal and describes the courtyard that lay to the east of the Temple. 
If we think about Tractate Middot as a whole we can see that the first two chapters brought us on to the Temple Mount and into the outer courtyards, the fourth chapter discussed the Hekhal and the fifth chapter went back to the courtyard. At the heart of the tractate, in chapter three, is the description of the outer altar, certainly the most important piece of the Temple on an everyday basis. In my opinion, the literary structure of this tractate is clearly intentional.

Mishnah One
The whole of the courtyard was a hundred and eighty-seven cubits long by a hundred and thirty-five broad. 
From east to west it was a hundred and eighty-seven. 
The space in which the Israelites could go was eleven cubits. 
The space in which the priests could go was eleven cubits. 
The altar took up thirty-two. 
Between the Porch and the altar was twenty-two cubits. 
The Hekhal took up a hundred cubits, and there were eleven cubits behind the kapporet.

Explanation
Section one: The 187 cubits is measured from the Israelite's courtyard (the Nicanor Gate) to the outer walls of the Temple. It does not include the Women's courtyard.
Section two: The Israelites' courtyard was eleven cubits wide, as was the priests' courtyard.
Immediately after the priests' courtyard began the outer altar, which was thirty-two cubits broad (see 3:1). There were twenty-two cubits between the outer altar and the beginning of the Porch (see 3:6). This brings us to a total of 76 cubits.
The Hekhal was 100 cubits from east to west (see 4:7). On the other side of the Holy of Holies, which held the kapporet, from the western wall of the Hekhal to the western wall of the Temple, there were another 11 cubits, bringing us to a grand total of 187 cubits.
