Middot, Chapter Three, Mishnah Eight 

Mishnah Eight
There were poles of cedar wood stretching from the wall of the Sanctuary to the wall of the Porch to prevent it from bulging.   
There were chains of gold fixed in the roof beams of the Porch by which the priestly initiates used to ascend and see the crowns, as it says, “And the crowns shall be to Helem and to Toviyah and to Yedaya and to Hen the son of Zephaniah as a memorial in the Temple of the Lord” (Zechariah 6:14).   
A golden vine stood at the door of the Sanctuary trained on poles, and anyone who offered a leaf or a grape or a bunch used to bring it and hang it there. 
Rabbi Eliezer bar Zadok said: on one occasion three hundred priests were commissioned [to clear it].
