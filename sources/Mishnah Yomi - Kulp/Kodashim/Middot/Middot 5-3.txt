Middot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Our mishnah that were in the Israelites' courtyard or within. Most of the mishnah is self-explanatory, but I have made a few comments below.

Mishnah Three 
There were six chambers in the courtyard, three on the north and three on the south. 
On the north were the salt chamber, the parvah chamber and the washer's chamber. 
In the salt chamber they used to keep the salt for the offerings. 
In the parvah chamber they used to salt the skins of the animal-offerings. 
On its roof was the bath used by the high priest on Yom Kippur.  
In the washersâ€™ chamber they used to wash the entrails of the sacrificial animals, and from it a winding way went up to the roof of the parvah chamber.

Explanation
Section two: These three chambers were close to one another, on the northeastern corner of the Israelites' courtyard. There are two explanations as to why it was called the "parvah chamber." The first is that the person who dedicated it was named "Parvah" either as a first or last name. The second is that the word "parvah" is after the "parot" or cows, whose hides were treated their. In modern Hebrew the word "parvah" means fur, but cows, sheep and goats don't really have fur.
Section five: The high priest would immerse five times on Yom Kippur, all within the Temple confines. See Yoma 3:3. Here we learn that these immersions were done on the roof of the parvah chamber. 
Section six: In this chamber they would wash out the animal's stomach. The intestines were washed on the tables near the dwarf pillars, as we learned in Tamid 4:3.
