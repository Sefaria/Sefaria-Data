Middot, Chapter Two, Mishnah One

Introduction
Chapter two deals with the dimensions of the Temple Mount and its courtyards.

Mishnah One 
The Temple Mount was five hundred cubits by five hundred cubits.  
The greater part of it was on the south; next to that on the east; next to that on the north; and the smallest part on the west. 
The part which was most extensive was the part most used.

Explanation
Section one: This accords with the dimensions stated in Ezekiel 42:20. 
Section two:  The Temple was not centered in the middle of the Temple Mount. Rather it was to the northwestern side. Most of the empty ground was on the south. The second greatest empty area was on the east, then the north. The western side, or more accurately, the northwestern side, is where the Temple was located. As an aside, this is why the Western Wall is the closest of the walls to the actual Temple. Today if you go into the tunnels to the north of the western wall, you get as close as is possible to the Temple, without going onto the Temple Mount.
Section three: For non-priests, the most extensive use was in the south, where the largest empty area was located.
