Middot, Chapter Three, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
On the floor beneath at that corner there was a place a cubit square on which was a marble slab with a ring fixed in it, and through this they used to go down to the pit to clean it out.   
There was an ascent on the south side of the altar, thirty-two cubits [long] by sixteen broad. 
It had a square window in its western side where disqualified sin-offerings of birds were placed.

Explanation
Section one: The blood and refuse would flow down to the pit (called in Hebrew the “shit”—wonder if that’s coincidental?). There was a trap door that would lead down to the pit and the priests would periodically clean it out of congealed blood so that it wouldn’t get clogged. That might not have been a job that they had to fight to get. 
Section two: The ascent was the ramp that the priests used to go up to the altar. It was long and quite broad.
Section three: Sin-offerings of birds had to be left somewhere until they would begin to rot. Then they could be burned outside the Temple. To this end the birds were left in a small window/cavity cut out of the ascent.
