Middot, Chapter One, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five 
On the north was the Gate of the Sparks which was shaped like a portico.   
It had an upper chamber built on it, and the priests used to keep watch above and the Levites below, and it had a door opening into the Hel.  
Next to it was the Gate of the Sacrifice and next to that the fire chamber.

Explanation
Section one: On the north there was the Gate of the Sparks. There were pillars on both sides, which made it look like a portico.
Section two: The Gate of the Sparks, unlike most gates, also had an upper chamber. The priests would stand on top and stand guard, as we learned in mishnah one. The Levites would stand below and guard (see also mishnah one). 
The Gate had a door that opened onto the Hel. The Hel was an area ten amot wide that went between the Soreg (a light fence) and the walls of the Courtyard. We will explain more about this later in 2:3.
Section three: To the east of the Gate of the Sparks was the Gate of the Sacrifice. Next to it was the fire chamber, mentioned above in mishnah one.
