Temurah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Four

Introduction
The final mishnah of our chapter has another case of a hatat that must be left to die. 

Mishnah Four
If one set aside a hatat and it is blemished, he sells it and brings another with its money.
Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Shimon says: if the second animal was offered before the first was killed, it is left to die, since the owners have [already] obtained atonement.

Explanation
Section one: In this case he can’t sacrifice the first hatat because it is blemished. Therefore, he sells it and brings another with the proceeds.
Section two: Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Shimon thinks that this too can become a case of a hatat left to die. Even though the original hatat was sold and now belongs to another person, if it is still alive when the second animal is offered, it still counts as a hatat whose owners had received atonement from another hatat and it too must be left to die. In other words, even though the first hatat wasn’t a “lost hatat” it still must be left to die if it is alive when the owners receive atonement.
