Temurah, Chapter Six, Mishnah One

Introduction
Chapter six contains information concerning animals that cannot be put onto the altar for various reasons.

Mishnah One
All [animals] forbidden for the altar render [others] unfit however few there are.  
[These are the animals forbidden for the altar]:
An animal which had sexual relations with [a woman] or [an animal] that had sexual relations [with a man], 
an animal set aside (muktzeh) [for idolatry], or that had been worshipped (ne’evad) [as an idol]; 
or that was the fee of a whore, or [a dog's] exchange; 
or that was kilayim; 
or terefah; 
or an animal born through a caesarean section,
What is meant by muktzeh? That which has been set aside for idolatrous use.
It [the animal itself] is forbidden, but what is upon it, is permitted.  
And what is meant by ne'evad? That which has been used for idolatry.
Both it [the animal itself] and that which is upon it, are forbidden.  
In both cases the animal may be eaten. 

Explanation
Section one: If an animal is one of the kinds of animals that cannot be put onto the altar, then if it becomes mixed up with other animals, all of the animals are forbidden, even if there were many permitted animals and only one forbidden one. In other words, there is no measure in which the forbidden animals are nullified, as there are in other forbidden mixtures.
Section two: This is the list of animals that cannot be put on the altar. We have explained these in Zevahim 8:1 and our mishnah and the following ones will deal below with categories b-c. Kilayim is an animal born from two different species of parents, such as a goat and a sheep. A terefah is an animal with a wound/disease that will cause it to die imminently. 
Section three: “Muktzeh” means “set aside” and here it refers to an animal that has been set aside to be used in an idolatrous ritual, but that has not yet been used. It itself cannot be offered as a Jewish sacrifice, but anything on it, jewels, a saddle, etc. is not yet forbidden.
Section four: “Ne’evad” means that the animal has already been used in idolatry. Here the prohibition is broader and includes even the things that decorate the animal. 
However, both animals can be eaten as non-sacrificial meat as long as they were not already slaughtered for the sake of idolatry.
