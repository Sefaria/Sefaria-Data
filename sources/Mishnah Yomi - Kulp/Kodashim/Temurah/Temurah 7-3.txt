Temurah, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Three

Introduction
In today’s mishnah we learn ways in which dedications for the repairs of the Temple are treated the same as dedications for the altar.

Mishnah Three
Both dedications for the altar and dedications for the repairs of the Temple may not be changed from one holiness to another.  
One may dedicate them with a value-dedication, and one may conscribe them.  
If they die, they are buried.  
Rabbi Shimon says: dedications for the repairs of the temple, if they died, they are redeemed.

Explanation
Section one: Once someone has dedicated an animal for a certain purpose he cannot change that purpose. For instance, if one dedicated an animal to be an olah, he can’t later change his mind and make it into a shelamim. Similarly, if one dedicated an animal to be sold and used for Temple repairs, he can’t change his mind and dedicate it for the altar.
Section two: A person can use either type of dedicated thing to make a vow of value. This is a subject we just learned in Arakhin 8:7. A person can dedicate to the Temple the benefit that he gets from bringing an already dedicated ox (or other animal) to the Temple. In other words, how much would you pay to bring this ox as a sacrifice? If someone makes such a vow, he owes that much money to the Temple. Similarly one can conscribe an already dedicated thing. Again this means that he owes the monetary amount of benefit he is receiving by having the merit to bring this sacrifice. 
Section three: If either type of dedicated animal dies, it cannot be redeemed because it cannot be stood up for a formal process of evaluation. Since there is no way to “remove” the holiness, the animal must be buried. Rabbi Shimon holds that animals dedicated for Temple repair can be redeemed without a formal process of evaluation. Therefore, they can be redeemed even after death.
