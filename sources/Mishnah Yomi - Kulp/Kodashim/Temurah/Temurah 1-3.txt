Temurah, Chapter One, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a person who tries to substitute either parts of an animal or embryos for a whole dedicated animal, or vice versa. 

Mishnah Three
One cannot substitute limbs [of hullin] for [dedicated] embryos; 
Or embryos [of hullin] for [dedicated] limbs; 
Or embryos and limbs [of hullin] for whole [dedicated animals];  
Or whole [animals of hullin] for them. 
Rabbi Yose says: limbs [of hullin] can be substituted for whole [dedicated animals], but whole [animals of hullin] cannot be substitute for them.   
Rabbi Yose said: When it comes to dedicating animals, is it not true that if one says: “This foot shall be an olah (a burnt offering),” the whole [animal] becomes an olah? Similarly, if one says, “This foot shall be in place of this [whole dedicated animal],” the whole [animal] should become a substitute in its place!

Explanation
Section one: According to the first opinion, one can substitute only whole animals for other whole animals. One cannot substitute parts or embryos for whole animals, or whole animals for parts or embryos that have been dedicated to the Temple.
Section two: According to Rabbi Yose if a person says, “This limb is in place of this dedicated animal,” the limb does become holy as a substitute. Once the limb is holy its holiness “spreads” over the entire animal and the entire animal is holy. 
Section three: Rabbi Yose explains his opinion by analogizing it to a case where a person dedicates the limb of an animal. In such a case the entire animal becomes an olah (assuming that is what he said it would be). So too, when one tries to substitute a limb for an entire animal, the entire substitute animal becomes holy.
