Temurah, Chapter Five, Mishnah Six

Introduction
The final mishnah of chapter six discusses the precise language that must be used for a substitute to be valid.

Mishnah Six 
[If one says:] “Behold this animal shall be instead of a hatat,” [or] “instead of an olah,” he has said nothing.
[But if he says:] “Instead of this hatat” [or] “Instead of this olah,” [or] “Instead of the hatat or the olah which I have in the house,” and he had it in the house, his words stand. 
If he says concerning an unclean animal or a blemished animal: “Behold these shall be an olah,” he has said nothing. 
[But if he says:] “Behold they shall be for an olah,” they are sold and he brings with their money an olah.

Explanation
Section one: In order for the substitute to be valid he must specify the animal that is being substituted for. If he does not specify an animal that he owns, then his words have no validity.
Section two: One cannot make an unclean animal (such as a pig or camel) into an olah, or any sacrifice for that matter. If one takes such an animal and declares it to be an olah, he has said nothing. However, if he says that the animal will “be for an olah” we interpret him as meaning that the animal will be used to bring another animal for an olah. Therefore the unclean or blemished animal can be sold and with its proceeds an olah is brought.
