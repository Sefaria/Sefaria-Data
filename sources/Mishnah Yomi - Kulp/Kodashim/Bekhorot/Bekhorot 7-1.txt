Bechorot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah One

Introduction
Since chapter six dealt with blemishes that render an animal unfit to be a sacrifice, this chapter lists blemishes that disqualify a priest from serving in the Temple. 

Mishnah One
These blemishes [named above], whether permanent or transitory, make human beings unfit [to serve in the Temple].  
There are more than this concerning human beings: kilon, liftan, makkaban, one whose head is angular or shekifas . 
A hunchback: 
Rabbi Judah considers him fit, 
Whereas the sages consider him unfit.

Explanation
Section one: The same blemishes that disqualify animals also disqualify priests from serving in the Temple. That a priest with a blemish cannot serve in the Temple is stated in Leviticus 21:21, “No man among the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a defect shall be qualified to offer the Lord’s gift; having a defect, he shall not be qualified to offer the food of his God.” Our chapter will explain and expand the list found in this chapter of Leviticus.
Section two: There are other defects that also can prevent a man from serving as a priest. The defects in this section refer to various types of misshapen heads. A kilon is one with a wedge-shaped head, a laftan is one with a turnip shaped head, a makkavan is one with a hammer-shaped head and a shekifas is one with a bent head. In other words, for a priest to serve in the Temple, his head must be shaped in a normal fashion.
Section three: The sages debate whether a hunchback can serve as a priest in the Temple. Rabbi Judah says that it does not disqualify him from serving, whereas the sages consider him unfit.
