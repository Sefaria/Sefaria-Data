Bekhorot, Chapter Four, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five 
If one takes payment for seeing first borns, they must not be slaughtered by his instructions unless he was an expert like Ila in Yavneh whom the sages permitted to accept four isars for small cattle and six as for large cattle, whether unblemished or blemished. 

Explanation
Generally speaking it is forbidden for a sage to take wages in return for examining a first born to see if it is blemished or not. If a sage does take a wage and he declares it blemished the animal may not be slaughtered because it is feared that the wage acted as a bribe. 
The one exception is men who are like the legendary Ila in Yavneh. Ila was a great expert in blemishes and many priests would bring him their animals for examination. He was also wealthy enough that he didn’t need their payments. A bribe wouldn’t cause him to allow an unblemished animal to be slaughtered. Finally, he was known to be an honest man who would not lie in return for money. Because he exhibited all of these qualities, he was allowed to charge a fee for examining first borns. However, it is important to note that he collected his fee whether or not he declared the animal to be blemished. Obviously, it would be extremely problematic for him to collect his fee only if he declared it blemished. This would truly be a recipe for bribes.
