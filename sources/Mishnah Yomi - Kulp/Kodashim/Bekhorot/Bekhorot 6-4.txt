Bekhorot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Todayâ€™s mishnah deals with defects of the nose and mouth.

Mishnah Four
If its nose is perforated, defective, or slit, or its upper lip perforated, defective, or slit [these are disqualifying blemishes].
If the outer incisors are defective or leveled [to the gum] or the molars are torn out [completely], [these are disqualifying blemishes]. 
But Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: we do not examine behind the molars, nor the molars themselves.

Explanation
Section one: If there is any defect of the nose or upper lip, the first born is considered blemished and it may be slaughtered. 
Section two: I have translated this section to refer to the defects of the teeth. The words may also be understood as referring to defects of the gums. In any case, the rule is stricter with regard to the outer incisors than it is for the inner molars. For the inner molars to be considered defective, they must be completely torn out.
