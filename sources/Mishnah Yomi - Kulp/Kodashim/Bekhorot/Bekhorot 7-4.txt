Bekhorot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Four

Introduction
If some of a person’s limbs, nose or ears are either too large or too small, the person cannot serve as a priest. Basically, we can summarize that the rabbis thought the priest should look normal and have normal proportions.
I might want to add at this point, that in the ancient world it was thought that a strange outer appearance reflects a problematic inner self, perhaps lack of morality or lack of intelligence. While today we know that this is often, and perhaps usually not so, we should, I believe, acknowledge, that it is sometimes so, and that sometimes, mental problems accompany physical defects. It is not surprising that people in the pre-modern world, including rabbis, took this as the rule. Thankfully, though, we now understand better that, as they say, “one should not judge a book by its cover.”
The mishnah is pretty straightforward, so I will explain only where I feel necessary.

Mishnah Four
One whose eyes are as large as a calf's or as small as those of a goose; 
Or whose body is [unduly] large for his limbs, [unduly] small for his limbs; or whose nose is [unduly] large for his limbs, or whose nose is [unduly] small for his limbs; 
A tzimem and a zimea. 
What is tzimea? One whose ears are very small. 
What is tzimem? One whose ears resemble a sponge.

Explanation
Section three: The only section that probably needs explanation is the “tzimem” whose ears resemble a sponge. According to Rashi, this means that they are shrunken and closed. Maimonides interprets it to mean large and swollen. In either case, they are deformed.
