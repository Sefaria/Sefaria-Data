Bekhorot, Chapter Two, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with an animal born through what is today called a cesarean section. The term the Mishnah uses is “one who came out through the wall” because this animal was taken out through the wall of its mother’s stomach. 

Mishnah Nine
With regard to [an animal] that was born through a cesarean section and the first born which came after it: 
Rabbi Tarfon says: both go out to pasture until blemished and are eaten with their blemishes by the owners.
But Rabbi Akiva says: neither of them is a first born; the first because it did not open its mother’s womb, and the second, because another preceded it.

Explanation
Section one: Rabbi Tarfon believes that both animals are doubtful first borns. The one born through cesarean section was the first born and the second one was the one who opened its mother’s womb, the phrase the Torah uses to describe a first born (see Exodus 13). Therefore, both must go out to pasture until they become blemished and then they may be eaten (blemishes and all) by their owners. 
Section two: According to Rabbi Akiva, in order for the rule of the first born to apply, the animal must be a first born and be the first to open its mother’s womb. The first born did not open its mother’s womb and the second was not the first born, so the law of the first born does not apply to either.
