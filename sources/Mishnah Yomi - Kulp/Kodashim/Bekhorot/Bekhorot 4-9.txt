Bekhorot, Chapter Four, Mishnah Nine

Mishnah Nine
If one is suspected of selling terumah as hullin, one may not buy even water and salt from him, the words of Rabbi Judah. 
Rabbi Shimon says: [one may not buy from him] whatever is connected to terumah and tithes.

Explanation
Section one: Rabbi Judah rules strictly—one can’t buy any food products from someone suspected of selling terumah as if it were hullin, even water and salt, which obviously are not subject to the laws of terumah. This is a punishment for the fact that he sells terumah as hullin, which is a serious offense, akin to a butcher who today would sell non-kosher meat as kosher meat. 
Section two: Rabbi Shimon rules more leniently—one can’t buy from him only objects that are liable for terumah, namely agricultural products. It is permitted to buy from this person water and salt. This would be like saying today that if a kosher butcher sells non-kosher meat one could still buy drinks, bread etc. from him.
