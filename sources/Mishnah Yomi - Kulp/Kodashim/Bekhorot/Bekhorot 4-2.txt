Bekhorot, Chapter Four, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our mishnah is a direct continuation of yesterday’s mishnah, where we learned that a priest is supposed to eat the first-born within its first year.

Mishnah Two
If a blemish appeared on it in its first year, he is permitted to keep it all the twelve months.   
If after the twelve months, however, he is not permitted to keep it except for thirty days. 

Explanation
Section one: If it is blemished before the year is up, he can wait up to a year to eat it. 
Section two: If the year has already passed, he must slaughter it within thirty days. 
It is interesting to note that the reason someone might want to wait to slaughter his first born is probably because he doesn’t want to eat such a large quantity of meat until there is some special occasion (wedding, perhaps). People in the ancient world did not eat meat on a regular basis. The Torah (and Mishnah) need to prohibit waiting, because otherwise, people might hold on to their first borns for a long time.
