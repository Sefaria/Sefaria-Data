Bekhorot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven 
The five selas of a first-born [are paid in] the standard of Tyrian maneh.  
As regards the thirty shekels of a slave and likewise the fifty shekels of the rapist and seducer and the one hundred shekels for one who spreads an evil name  â€” in all these cases the payment is in the holy shekel, in the standard of Tyrian maneh. 
All of these are redeemed with money or the equivalent of money with the exception of shekel payments. 

Explanation
Section one:  When we come to reckon how much the father has to pay the priest, the five selas, which are the five shekels mentioned in the Torah, are reckoned in the standard of the Tyrian maneh. A Tyrian sela consists of 14.34 grams of pure silver, so the father would have to give five times this amount.
Section two: Any payment that is given as a fixed monetary amount in the Torah must be paid out in holy shekel, evaluated according to the standard of the Tyrian maneh, just as is the case with redeeming the first-born. There are four such cases listed here:
1) If an ox kills a slave, the owner of the ox pays the owner of the slave thirty shekels (Exodus 21:32). 
2) If a man seduces a virgin, he pays the father fifty shekels (Exodus 22:15-16).
3) If he rapes a virgin, he pays fifty shekels (Deuteronomy 22:28-29).
4) If a husband defames his wife by falsely claiming that she was not a virgin on their wedding day, he is fined 100 shekels (Deuteronomy 22:19).
Section three: In all cases where something needs to be redeemed, such as a first born son or an item dedicated to the Temple, the redemption can be done either with money or with something of equivalent value. The redemption need not be done just with coins. The exception is the half shekel that is paid on a yearly basis to the Temple in Jerusalem. This half shekel must be paid in coinage.
