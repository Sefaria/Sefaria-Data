Bekhorot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Today’s mishnah introduces other various scenarios where children become mixed up and it is unclear if one is liable for redemption as a first born.

Mishnah Five
If two women who had never before given birth married two men and gave birth to two males, the one father gives five selas to the priest and the other gives five selas to the priest. 
If one of the children died within thirty days [of its birth], if they gave the redemption money to one priest alone, he returns five selas to them, but if they gave the money to two priests, they are not able to recover it from them.   
If they gave birth to a male and a female, the fathers are exempt, whereas the son must redeem himself [as in any case he is a first-born]. 
If they gave birth to two females and a male or to two females and two males, the priest receives nothing.   

Explanation
Section one: Since both children are first born boys, it is obvious that both fathers must give five selas to a priest to redeem their sons.
Section two: Since one died before reaching thirty days, only one of the fathers needed to redeem his son. It is uncertain which father must give. If they both gave the five selas to the same priest, the priest must return five selas and they can split it between them. However, if they gave the money to two priests, then each priest can claim that he received the money for the living child and he doesn’t have to return it. The fathers will not be able to recover any money. 
Section three: In this case, the male is definitely a first born but it is unclear who his father is. The father is therefore exempt from redeeming the son. However, the son, who is after all a first born, must redeem himself when he is old enough to do so.
Section four: In this case, it is possible that none of the children is a first born male, and therefore the priest receives nothing.
