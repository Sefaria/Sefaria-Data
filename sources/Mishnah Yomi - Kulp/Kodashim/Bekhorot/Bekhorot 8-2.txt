Bekhorot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with matters relating to a child born of a caesarean section, called in Hebrew—one who goes out from the wall.

Mishnah Two
A fetus extracted by means of a caesarean section and one that follows—neither is a first-born for inheritance or a first-born to be redeemed from a priest. 
Rabbi Shimon says: the first is a first-born for inheritance and the second is a first-born as regards [the redemption] with five selas.

Explanation
Section one: According to the first opinion, a child born through a c-section does not count as a first born because he wasn’t actually “born.” He doesn’t inherit, nor does he need to be redeemed because he didn’t open his mother’s womb. 
However, the next child doesn’t count as the first born either, because he is not his father’s first child. Also, even if the mother survives the c-section and has another child, it is not considered the first-born for redemption, because his mother already had a viable child, even though it didn’t “open her womb.” We should note that in mishnaic times, it would have been exceedingly rare for a woman to survive a c-section. Nevertheless, the mishnah accounts for the possibility.
Section two: Rabbi Shimon disagrees completely. The first child, born of a c-section, counts as the first for inheritance, because it is its father’s first born. The second child needs to be redeemed because it “opens its mother’s womb.” It must be redeemed from the priest for five selas, which are equivalent to the five shekels mentioned in the Torah.
