Bekhorot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Our mishnah continues to deal with blemishes of the eye.

Mishnah Three
Havarvar [white spots] on the cornea and water constantly dripping from the eye, [are disqualifying blemishes]. 
What do we mean by a permanent hawarwar? If it remained for a period of eighty days.   
Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: we must examine it three times in the eighty days.   
And the following are cases of constant dripping from the eye [and how to test its permanency]: if it ate [for a cure] fresh [fodder] and dry [fodder] from a field sufficiently watered by rain [it is a permanent blemish, if not cured].
[If it ate] fresh [fodder] and then dry [fodder] from a field requiring artificial irrigation, or if it ate dry [fodder] first and then fresh [fodder from field watered by rain] it is not a blemish unless it eats dry [fodder] after the fresh.  

Explanation
Section one: The two blemishes discussed here are white spots on the cornea, which is probably a type of cataract and water dripping from the eye, which probably means that the animal has an eye infection.
Section two: In order for the white spots to be considered a blemish they must be present for eighty days in a row. Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus adds in that we must check at least three times during the eighty days. It is not sufficient if we know that the white spots were there in the beginning of the eighty days and at the end. 
Section three: There is a cure for a dripping eye—to eat first fresh fodder and then dry fodder from a field irrigated by rain. If the animal eats this cure and it isn’t healed then the animal has a permanent blemish. However, if he eats fodder from an artificially irrigated field or dry fodder and then fresh fodder from a rain-irrigated field, and the eye continues to drip, it is not a sign of a permanent blemish because the animal did not eat the proper cure.
