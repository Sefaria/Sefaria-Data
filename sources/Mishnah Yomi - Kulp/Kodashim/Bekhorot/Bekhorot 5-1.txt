Bekhorot, Chapter Five, Mishnah One

Introduction
Animals that have been dedicated to the Temple and then became blemished can be sold, the profit going to the Temple. Our mishnah teaches that this works a bit differently for blemished first borns.

Mishnah Five
All dedicated animals which became unfit [for the altar] are sold in a market, slaughtered in a market and weighed by the liter, except for a first born or a tithed animal, as their profit goes to the owners, [whereas] the profit on dedicated objects which became unfit goes to the Temple. 
One can weigh one piece of meat of the first-born against another piece of ordinary meat.

Explanation
Section one: It is considered somewhat disgraceful that a once holy animal should be slaughtered and sold in the marketplace like common meat. However, this is also the most profitable way to sell the animal’s meat. Normal dedicated animals may be slaughtered and sold in the market, and weighed using weights because we want to maximize the profit that goes to the Temple. 
In contrast, the profit from selling a blemished first born or tithed animal goes to the priests (or in certain cases the original owners), therefore, we are not concerned with maximizing the profit. In such a case, we want to minimize the disgrace to the animal and its meat. The animal should be slaughtered and sold privately, at one’s home. The meat should not be weighed on scales using known weights, but rather its weight should be estimated. 
Section two: While one cannot weigh the meat of the first born on a scale using set weights, it is permitted to weigh it on a scale using another piece of meat of known weight. This is not considered to be as disgraceful.
