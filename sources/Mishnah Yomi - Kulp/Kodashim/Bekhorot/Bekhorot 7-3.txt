Bekhorot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Our mishnah continues to deal with defects of the eyes.

Mishnah Three
A harum is unfit [for the priesthood]. 
What is a harum? One who can paint both of his eyes with one movement.   
If both of his eyes were above or both of his eyes were below; or if one one eye was above and the other below; 
Or one who sees the room and the ceiling in one glance;   
Or one who covers [his eyes] from the sun;   
A zugdos and a tziran.
One whose eyelashes have fallen off is unfit [for the priesthood] for appearance sake.

Explanation
Section one: A harum is one who can paint both of his eyes with one movement. This is interpreted to mean that his nose is sunken in, so that he could paint both eyes with one stroke.
Section two: The mishnah now continues to list other eye defects. If both eyes are higher or lower than normal, or if they are uneven, one eye being higher than the other, then he may not serve in the Temple.
Section three: This seems to mean that he is cross-eyed, one eye looking up and one eye looking down.
Section four: If he is extremely photo-sensitive, he can’t serve. We should note that the Temple was not shaded, so for a priest who can’t bear the sun, serving at the altar might have been unbearable.
Section five: A zugdos is interpreted as being a person with eyes or eyebrows of different colors. A tziran is one whose eyes constantly water. All of these visual defects disqualify a priest from serving in the Temple.
Section six: The rabbis stated that one whose eyelashes have fallen out cannot serve in the Temple, because his appearance is strange. In other words, he does not have a defect that prevents him from serving, but we don’t let him serve because of his strange appearance.
