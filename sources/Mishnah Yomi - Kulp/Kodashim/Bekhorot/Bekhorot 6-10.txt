Bekhorot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Ten

Introduction 
In the first section of this mishnah, Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus adds several more defects to the list. In the second section, Rabbi Judah adds another defect, but the other sages disagree with him.
Since the mishnah is quite clear on its own, there is no commentary below. 

Mishnah Ten
Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: if [a first born] has a wart in its eye or if a bone of its fore-leg or hind-leg is defective, or if the bone of the mouth split, or one eye is large and the other small, or one ear is large and the other small, being visibly so and not merely in measurement [all of these are blemishes]. 
Rabbi Judah says: if one testicle is as large as two of the other [this is a blemish]. 
But the sages didnâ€™t agree with him.
