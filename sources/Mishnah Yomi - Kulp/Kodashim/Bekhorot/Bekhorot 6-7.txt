Bekhorot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah deals with defects in the legs and feet.

Mishnah Seven
If [a first born] has five legs or if it has only three legs, or if its feet are uncloven like that of a donkey, or if it is a shahul or a kasul [these are blemishes]. 
What is a shahul? [An animal] with a dislocated hip.
What is a kasul? [An animal] one of whose hips is higher than the other.

Explanation
Section one: An extra or a missing leg renders an animal defective, as do several other defects in the leg.
Section two: The mishnah now defines the terms shahul and kasul. The first term refers to an animal with a dislocated hip, whereas the second term refers to an animal whose hips are of different height. Both defects make a first born animal fit for slaughter.
