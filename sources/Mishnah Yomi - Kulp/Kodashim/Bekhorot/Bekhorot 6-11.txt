Bekhorot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Eleven

Introduction
This is the final mishnah that lists blemishes that disqualify an animal.

Mishnah Eleven 
If the tail of a calf does not reach the joint, [it is a blemish]. 
The sages said: the growth of all calves is in this manner, as long as [the animals] grow, the tails also extend [below]. 
To which joint does this refer? Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: the joint in the middle of the hip.
In consequence of these blemishes we may slaughter a firstborn animal, and consecrated animals rendered unfit [for the altar] in consequence of these blemishes may be redeemed.

Explanation
Section one: According to the first opinion, if the tail does not reach the joint in the middle of the hip, the joint that connects the thigh bone with the thigh, the animal is defective. The other sages disagree and say that it is normal for the tail to grow slowly. Thus if early in life the tail does not reach the hip joint, it is not a blemish because it will grow later.
Section two: This section relates to all of the blemishes listed above in the chapter. If a first born has any one of these blemishes it may be slaughtered and it need not be brought to the Temple as a sacrifice. If a consecrated animal develops one of these blemishes it cannot be offered as a sacrifice and must be redeemed for money.
