Bekhorot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four 
If a first born was running after him and he kicked it and thereby blemished it, he may slaughter it on account of this.
Any blemish which might have been made by a person, Israelite shepherds are trustworthy whereas shepherds who are priests are not trustworthy.   
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: he is trustworthy with regard to somebody else's first born, but he is not trustworthy with regard to his own. 
Rabbi Meir says: one who is suspected of neglecting a religious matter must not issue judgment on it or give evidence concerning it.

Explanation
Section one: Since this person did not intentionally blemish the first born in order to slaughter it and eat it, it can be slaughtered on account of this blemish.
Section two: The mishnah now returns to the issue of trustworthiness. An Israelite shepherd is trusted if he says that a blemish that could have been done by a person happened naturally, because the Israelite does not get to eat the animal himself. The assumption is that a person won’t lie in order to provide benefit to another person. However, the priest shepherd is not trusted because he himself could benefit from his lie. 
Section three: Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel refines the previous section. The priest shepherd can be trusted if he is testifying concerning another priest’s first born. His lack of trustworthiness is limited to his own animals, where has a vested stake in their being deemed blemished.
Section four: Rabbi Meir disagrees with Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel and says that if a person is not trusted with regard to a certain matter, such as first born blemishes, then he is not trusted to testify with regard to any issue that is connected with that matter. Thus if a priest is not trusted with regard to his own first borns, then he can’t be trusted to testify with regard to other priest’s first borns.
