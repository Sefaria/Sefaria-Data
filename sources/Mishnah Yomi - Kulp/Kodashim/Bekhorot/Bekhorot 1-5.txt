Bekhorot, Chapter One, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah provides limits as to what type of animal can be used to redeem the first-born of a donkey. 

Mishnah Five
We do not redeem with a calf, a wild animal, an animal slaughtered, a terefah, kilayim (a mixed breed) or a koy.  
Rabbi Eliezer permits [redemption] with kilayim because it is a lamb. 
But he forbids with a koy, because its nature is doubtful. 
If he gave [the first-born of a donkey] itself to the priest, the latter may not keep it, until he sets aside a lamb in its place.

Explanation
Section one: The redemption must be done with a lamb, one born of a sheep or a goat. A calf, born of a cow or a wild animal cannot be used.
The lamb must be alive when used to redeem the donkey. It cannot be either slaughtered or a terefah (died without being properly slaughtered). 
Kilayim is a mixed breed. Here it refers to an animal born of a mix between a sheep and a goat. According to the first opinion, a kilayim is not a lamb.
A koy is an animal which the rabbis couldn’t identify as either a domesticated or a wild animal (see Hullin 6:1). Since its status is not known, it cannot be used to redeem the first-born donkey.
Section two: Rabbi Eliezer disagrees with regard to the kilayim. Since both a sheep and a goat have offspring that are called “lambs (seh)” this animal can be used. He agrees, however, that a koy cannot be used. 
Section three: He cannot simply give the first-born donkey to the priest. If he does so, the priest must return it to him, until the Israelite sets aside a lamb to redeem the donkey. At this point, the priest may keep the donkey, if the Israelite wants him to have it.
