Bekhorot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Five

Today’s mishnah deals with defects in an animal’s genitalia. 

Mishnah Five 
If the sheath [of the penis] is defective or the genitals of a female animal in the case of sacrificial offerings [it is defective.]
If the tail is mutilated from the bone but not from the joint; or if the top end [root] of the tail is bared to the bone; or if there is flesh between one joint and another [in the tail] to the amount of a finger's breadth [the animal is defective].

Explanation
Section one: If the sheath that holds the male penis is defective, it won’t heal and therefore it constitutes a permanent wound. A female animal whose genitalia are defective cannot be offered as a sacrifice. It is not relevant to say that it cannot be a first-born since a bekhor (a first-born) must be a male. 
Section two: There are three defects listed here:
1) If the tail is mutilated on its bone part, then the animal is defective because the wound will not heal. However, if it is mutilated on the joint between the segments it can still be sacrificed as a first born.
2) If the root end of the tail is bared to the bone.
3) If there is too much space between the joints of the tail.
