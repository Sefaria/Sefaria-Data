	mishnah. How do we tithe animals? We bring them to a shed and make for them a small opening so that two shall not be able to go out at the same time. And we count [with the rod],   one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. And he marks every tenth lamb that goes out and says: this is [the tithe]â€™. If he failed to mark it, did not count them [the lambs] with a rod, or if he counted them while they were crouching or standing, they are still considered tithed. If he had one hundred [lambs] and he took ten   or if he had ten and he took one,   this is not [valid] tithe.   But r. Jose b. Judah says: this is [valid] tithe. If one [of the lambs] already counted   leaped among the flock [in the shed]   they are all exempt.   If one of them that was marked as tithe leaped among the flock [in the shed],   they all go to pasture until they become unfit for sacrifice,   and the owners may eat them in their unfit state.  
Mishnah. If two [lambs] came forth at the same time,   he counts them in pairs.   If he counted [the two]   as one, the ninth and the tenth are spoilt.   [if the ninth and the tenth came out at the same time, the ninth and the tenth are spoilt.]   If he called the ninth the tenth, the tenth the ninth and the eleventh the tenth, the three are holy. The ninth is eaten while blemished, the tenth is the tithe and the eleventh is sacrificed as a peace-offering, and it can effect a substitute.   These are the words of r. Meir. Said r. Judah: can that one substitute effect another substitute?   They said in the name of r. Meir: if it   were a substitute, it would not have been sacrificed.   If he called the ninth the tenth, the tenth the tenth and the eleventh the tenth, the eleventh is not consecrated.   The following is the rule: wherever the name of the tenth [animal] has not been eliminated therefrom,   the eleventh is not consecrated.
