Bekhorot, Chapter Six, Mishnah One

Introduction
Chapter six delineates the types of blemishes that disqualify a first born animal from being sacrificed. The Torah lists only two types of blemishes “lame and blind” (see Deuteronomy 15:21). However, the same verse also states, “any serious blemish.” From this verse the rabbis derive that any blemish that is significant like being lame and blind, renders the animal unfit. The general rule is that the blemish must be visible and a type of blemish that doesn’t heal. 
Today’s mishnah deals with blemishes of the ear.

Mishnah One 
In consequence of the following blemishes a first-born animal may be slaughtered:
If its ear has become defective, from the cartilages [inward] but not if the defect is in the ear-flap;  
If it is slit although there was no loss [of substance]; 
If it is perforated with a hole as large as a karshinah   
Or if [the ear] has become dry. 
What is considered “becoming dry”? If when pierced no drop of blood comes out. 
Rabbi Yose ben Meshullam says: [it] is dry when it crumbles [when touched].

Explanation
Section one: In order for the defect in the ear to disqualify the animal, it must be in the inner, cartilage part of the ear, and not in the flappy outside part. To be defective means that part of the ear has been removed. 
Section two: The animal is also disqualified if the entire cartilage part is slit, even if no part of the ear is missing. 
Section three: A karshinah is a type of legume. If the ear has a hole in it the size of this legume, the animal is disqualified.
Section four: A dry and withered out ear also disqualifies the animal. There are two opinions as to what makes an ear considered to be dry and withered out. The first is that it is void of blood. The second is that it is so dry that it crumbles when touched.
