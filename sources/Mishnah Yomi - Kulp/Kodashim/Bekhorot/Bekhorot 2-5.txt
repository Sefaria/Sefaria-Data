Bekhorot, Chapter Two, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
If a ewe gave birth to what looked like a kid, or a [female] goat gave birth to what looked like a lamb, it is exempt from [the law of] the first born. 
But if it some of the signs of [its mother] it is liable [to the law of the first born].

Explanation
Section one: As we learned in connection with the donkey, in order for the offspring to be liable for the law of the first born, it must be of the same species as its mother. If the offspring of a sheep looks like a goat, or the offspring of a goat looks like a sheep, it is exempt. 
Section two: If it looks a bit like its mother, then it is liable.
