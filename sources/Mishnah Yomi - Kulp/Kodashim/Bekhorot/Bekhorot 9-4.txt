Bekhorot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
All [domesticated animals] enter the shed to be tithed except kilayim, a terefah, offspring brought forth by means of a caesarean section, an animal too young for sacrifice, and an “orphan”. 
And what is an “orphan”? When its mother has died during its birth or was slaughtered [and subsequently gave birth.] 
But Rabbi Joshua says: even if the mother has been killed, if the hide is still intact the offspring is not an ‘orphan’ animal.

Explanation
Section one: There are several types of animals that do not need to be tithed:
1) Kilayim—the offspring of a mixed species. For instance, if a ram and a female goat have offspring, the offspring need not be tithed.
2) A terefah—an animal with a physical defect that would cause it to die.
3) An animal born through a c-section. Such an animal doesn’t need to be tithed, because it is not, in a sense, considered to have been born.
4) An animal too young to be sacrificed—an animal cannot be sacrificed until it is seven days old. It cannot be tithed until that age either.
5) An orphan animal. This is explained in the next section. 
Section two: The issue of the orphan is related to Leviticus 22:27, which states that an animal needs to be “under its mother” for seven days before it can be offered up as a sacrifice. If an animal is an orphan it need not be tithed, although it can eventually be sacrificed. According to the first opinion, if the mother doesn’t survive the birth, the offspring is an orphan and is not tithed. Rabbi Joshua says that as long as the mother’s hide is intact when the offspring is born, it is not an orphan. Albeck relates this to the practice of covering the offspring in its mother’s hide to keep it warm should the mother die during, or right before childbirth. Such an animal is “under its mother” and is therefore subject to the tithe.
