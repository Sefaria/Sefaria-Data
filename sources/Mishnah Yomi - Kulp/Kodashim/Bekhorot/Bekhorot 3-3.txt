Bekhorot, Chapter Three, Mishnah Three

Introduction
It is prohibited to shear a first born (this is based on a midrash on Deuteronomy 15:22). Our mishnah discusses how one can remove some of the hair of the first born without transgressing this prohibition. 

Mishnah Three 
Rabbi Yose ben Meshullam says: one who slaughters the first born, [first] clears a space with the [butcher's] knife on both sides and tears the hair, as long as he does not remove the wool from its place. 
And similarly one may tear the hair to show the place of the blemish [to a sage].

Explanation
Section one: If one wants to make space on the first born’s neck so that it can be properly slaughtered, what he should first do is use the butcher’s knife to clear some hair to the sides. Then he can pull out some of the hair but he should leave it stuck elsewhere in the animal’s wool so that it doesn’t look as if he is shearing. Someone who sees him act in such a manner will know that his intent is to clear some room on the animal’s neck, and not to remove the animal’s wool.
Section two: The same procedure should be followed if one wants to clear some hair from the animal to show the blemish to a sage so that the sage could declare it blemished.
