Menahot, Chapter Three, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah begins a series of mishnayot that continues through the fourth mishnah of the next chapter. In this series we learn that the absence of certain things prevents the fulfillment of a mitzvah.
In the first four sections of today’s mishnah we learn that if any of the following components of the minhah are missing even the smallest amount, then the whole is invalid: the handful removed from the minhah, the tenth of flour that constitutes the minhah, and the wine and oil libations that accompany the minhah. 
In section five we learn that without the oil one cannot fulfill the mitzvah of offering the flour and vice versa. And in section six we learn that one cannot fulfill the mitzvah of burning the handful without also burning the frankincense and vice versa.
The words of the mishnah themselves are straightforward, so you won’t find any additional commentary below.
