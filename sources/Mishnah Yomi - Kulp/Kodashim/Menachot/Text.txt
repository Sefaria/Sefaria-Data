Rabbi Tarfon said, as we find that wine which is offered as an obligation  may be offered as a freewill-offering,  so oil which is offered as an obligation may be offered as a freewill-offering.  Rabbi Akiba said to him, no, if you say so of wine it is because it is offered by itself even when offered as an obligation;  can you say the same of oil which is not offered by itself when offered as an obligation?  Two [men] may not jointly offer one tenth; but they may jointly offer a burnt-offering or a peace-offering, and of birds even a single bird.
Mishnah. [if a man said], ‘i take upon myself to bring a tenth’, he must bring one [tenth]; if ‘tenths’, he must bring two [tenths]. [if he said,] ‘i specified [a certain number of tenths] but i do not know what number i specified’, he must bring sixty tenths   [if he said,] ‘i take upon myself to bring a  minhah’, he may bring whichever kind he chooses.    Rabbi Judah says, he must bring a  minhah of fine flour, for that is the principal  minhah. [if he said] a  minhah’ or ‘a kind of  minhah’, he must bring one [of any kind]; if ‘ minhahs’ or a kind of  minhahs’, he must bring two [of any one kind]; [if he said,] ‘i specified [a certain kind], but i do not know what kind i specified’, he must bring the five kinds [if he said,] ‘i specified a  minhah of [a certain number of] tenths   but i do not know what number i specified, he must bring sixty tenths. But rabbi says, he must bring  minhahs [of every number] of tenths from one to sixty.  
Mishnah. [if a man said,] ‘i take upon myself to offer [pieces of] wood’, he must bring not less than two logs. If ‘frankincense’, he must bring not less than a handful. The handful is specified in five cases: if a man said, ‘i take upon myself to bring frankincense’. He must bring not less than a handful. If he offered a  minhah he must bring a handful of frankincense with it. If a man offered up the handful outside [the temple court] he is liable.   The two dishes [of frankincense]   require two handfuls.

   	[if a man said.] ‘i take upon myself to offer gold’, he must bring not less than a golden denar;   if silver’, he must bring not less than a silver denar; if ‘copper’. He must bring not less than [the value of] a silver ma'ah.   [if he said.] ‘i specified [how much i would bring] but i do not know what i specified’. He must bring so much until he says. ‘i certainly did not intend to give so much!’
	mishnah. [if a man said,] ‘i take upon myself to offer wine’, he must bring not less than three log.  If ‘oil’, he must bring not less than one log;  but rabbi says, not less than three logs.  [if he said,] i specified [how much i would offer] but i do not know what quantity i specified’, he must bring that quantity which is the most that is brought on any one day. 
Mishnah. [if a man said,] ‘i take upon myself to offer a burnt-offering,   he must bring a lamb.    Rabbi Eleazar b. Azariah said, [he may bring] a turtle-dove or a young pigeon. [if he said,] ‘i specified a beast of the herd   but i do not know what it was i specified’, he must bring a bull and a bull calf. [if he said, ‘i specified] a beast of the cattle   but i do not know what it was i specified’, he must bring a bull, a bull calf, a ram, a he-goat, a he-kid. And a he-lamb. [if he said,] ‘i specified [some kind] but i do not know what it was i specified’,
He must add to these a turtle-dove and a young pigeon.

   	[if a man said,] ‘i take upon myself to offer a thank-offering or a peace-offering’,  he must bring a lamb.[if he said,] ‘i specified a beast of the herd but i do not know what it was i specified’, he must bring a bull and a cow, a bull calf and a heifer. [if he said, i specified] a beast of the cattle but i do not know what it was i specified’, he must bring a bull and a cow, a bull calf and a heifer. A ram and a ewe, a he-goat and a she-goat, a he-kid and a she-kid, a he-lamb and a ewe-lamb.

   	[if a man said,] ‘i take upon myself to offer an ox. He must bring one with its drink-offerings to the value of a maneh;  if ‘a calf’, he must bring one with its drink-offerings to the value of five sela's; if ‘a ram’, he must bring one with its drink-offerings to the value of two sela's;  if ‘a lamb’, he must bring one with its drink-offerings to the value of one sela’. If he said ‘an ox valued at one maneh’, he must bring one worth a maneh apart from its drink-offerings; if a calf valued at five sela's’. He must bring one worth five sela's apart from its drink-offerings; if ‘a ram valued at two sela's’, he must bring one worth two sela's apart from its drink-offerings; and if a lamb valued at one sela’,’ he must bring one worth one sela’ apart from its drink-offerings. [if he said, ‘i take upon myself to offer] an ox valued at a maneh’, and he brought two together worth a maneh, he has not fulfilled his obligation. Even if one was worth a maneh less one denar and the other also was worth a maneh less one denar. [if he said] ‘a black one’ and he brought a white one, or a white one’ and he brought a black one, or ‘a large one’ and he brought a small one, he has not fulfilled his obligation. [if he said] ‘a small one’ and he brought a large one, he has fulfilled his obligation; but rabbi says, he has not fulfilled his obligation. Mishnah. [if a man said,] ‘this ox shall be a burnt-offering’, and it suffered a blemish,   he may, if he so desires, bring two with the price thereof. [if he said,] ‘these two oxen shall be a burnt-offering’, and they suffered a blemish, he may, if he so desires, bring one ox with the price thereof. But rabbi forbids it.   [if he said,] ‘this ram shall be a burnt-offering, and it suffered a blemish, he may, if he so desires, bring a lamb with the price thereof. [if he said,] ‘this lamb shall be a burnt-offering’. And it suffered a blemish, he may, if he so desires, bring a ram with the price thereof. But rabbi forbids it.
Mishnah. If a man said, ‘one of my lambs shall be holy’, or ‘one of my oxen shall be holy’, and he had two only, the larger one is holy. If he had three, the middle one is holy. [if he said,] ‘i specified one but i do not know which it was i specified’, or [if he said,] ‘my father told me   [that he had specified one] but i do not know which it is’, the largest one among them must be holy.
	mishnah. [if a man said,] ‘i take upon myself to offer a burnt-offering, he must offer it in the temple;  and if he offered it in the temple of onias,  he has not fulfilled his obligation. [if he said,] ‘i take upon myself to offer a burnt-offering but i will offer it in the temple of onias’. He must offer it in the temple,  yet if he offered it in the temple of onias he has fulfilled his obligation.  Rabbi  Shimon says, such is no burnt-offering. [if a man said.] ‘i will be a nazirite’. He must bring his offerings  in the temple; and if he brought them in the temple of onias he has not fulfilled his obligation. [if he said,] i will be a nazirite but i will bring my offerings in the temple of onias’. He must bring them in the temple, yet if he brought them in the temple of onias he has fulfilled his obligation.  Rabbi  Shimon says, such a one is not a nazirite.
Mishnah. The priests who ministered in the temple of onias may not minister in the temple in jerusalem; and needless to say [this is so of priests who ministered to] another matter;   for it is written, nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the lord in jerusalem. But they did eat unleavened bread among their brethren.   Thus they are like those that had a blemish:   they are entitled to share and eat [of the holy things]. But they are not permitted to offer sacrifices.
	mishnah. It is said of the burnt-offerings of cattle, an offering made by fire of a sweet savour;   and of the burnt-offerings of birds, an offering made by fire of a sweet savour;   and of the  minhah, an offering made by fire of a sweet savour:   to teach you that it is the same whether a man offers much or little, so long as he directs his heart to heaven.
