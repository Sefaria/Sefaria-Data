Menahot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah lists menahot that are either completely burned, or completely eaten.

Mishnah Two
The minhah of the priests,  
The minhah of the anointed high priest, 
And the minhah that is offered with the libations are [wholly] for the altar and the priests have no share in them; with these the altar is more privileged than the priests. 
The two loaves and the showbread are eaten by the priests and the altar has no share in them; with these the priests are more privileged than the altar.

Explanation
Section one: These three menahot are burned and no part of them is eaten. This is always the case with menahot that are brought by priests. In addition, it is also true of the minhah brought with the libations (Numbers 15:4ff).
Section two: The two loaves brought on Shavuot (Leviticus 23:20) and the showbread (Leviticus 24:9) are completely eaten by priests and no part is burned on the altar.
