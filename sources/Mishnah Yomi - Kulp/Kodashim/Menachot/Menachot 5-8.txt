Menahot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Leviticus 7:9 mentions minhahs “prepared in a pan or on a griddle.” Our mishnah teaches the difference in how these two minhahs are prepared.

Mishnah Eight 
One who says, “I take upon myself [to offer a minhah] prepared on a griddle,” he must not bring one prepared in a pan; 
If [he says, I take upon myself to offer a minhah prepared] in a pan,” he must not bring one prepared on a griddle. 
What is the difference between a griddle [mahabat] and a pan [marheshet]?  The pan has a lid to it, but the griddle has no lid, the words of Rabbi Yose the Galilean.  
Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel says: a pan is deep and what is prepared is spongy; a griddle is flat and what is prepared on it is hard.

Explanation
Section one: The first thing the mishnah asserts is that a minhah prepared in a pan is indeed different from one prepared on a griddle. Therefore, one who vows to bring one type of minhah cannot bring the other.
Section two: There are two opinions as to what the difference was between a griddle and a pan. According to Rabbi Yose the Galilean, the pan had a lid but the griddle did not. 
Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel says that the pan was deep and since there was more oil, the cake prepared was softer than that prepared on the flat griddle.
What is interesting to me is that these rabbis, living only one hundred years after the destruction of the Temple, already dispute how minhahs were prepared in the Temple. Clearly, they have no historical record to turn to, and therefore must decipher how things were done by reasoning out various verses in the Torah. This is probably quite common in Seder Kodashim and demonstrates well that much of the material in this Seder is not a record of what went on in the Temple but rather an interpretation of what the Torah says should have gone on in the Temple.
