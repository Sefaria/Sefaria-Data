Menahot, Chapter Six, Mishnah One

Introduction
This chapter continues to teach general rules with regard to menahot. Today’s mishnah and tomorrow’s teaches which minhah has a handful removed and the rest eaten by the priests.

Mishnah One
From the following menahot the handful must be taken and the remainder is for the priests: 
The minhah of fine flour,   
that prepared on a griddle,   
that prepared in a pan, 
the loaves and the wafers,   
the minhah of a Gentile, 
the minhah of women, 
the minhah of the omer, 
the sinners’ minhah,   
and the minhah of jealousy.    
Rabbi Shimon says: a sinners’ minhah brought by priests the handful is taken, and the handful is offered by itself and so also the remainder is offered by itself.

Explanation
Section one: All of these menahot have been explained already in mishnah three and five of the previous chapter. For all of them, a handful is removed and burned on the altar. The remainder is eaten by the priests.
Section two: Generally a minhah brought by priests is not also eaten by the priests. Rather it is all burned, as is stated explicitly in Leviticus 6:16. Therefore, it would seem that there is no reason to remove a handful, as is normally done with a sinners’ minhah. Nevertheless, Rabbi Shimon holds that first a handful is removed and burned by itself, and then the remainder is also burned by itself. In this way, the normal procedure is preserved.
