Menahot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah begins to note which minhahs must be brought to the altar (see Leviticus 2:8, 6:7), which have to be waved, which require one and not the other, and which require both. “Bringing near” refers to bringing the minhah close to the southwestern corner of the altar before the handful is removed.  Note that the structure of this mishnah is nearly identical to the structure of mishnah three.

Mishnah Five
Some [minhahs] require bringing near but not waving, some require bringing near and also waving, some require waving but not bringing near, and some require neither bringing near nor waving. 
These require bringing near but not waving: the minhah of fine flour, that prepared on a griddle, that prepared in a pan, the cakes and the wafers, the minhah of the priests, the minhah of the anointed high priest, the minhah of a gentile, the minhah of women, and the minhah of the omer.
Rabbi Shimon says: the minhah of the priests and the minhah of the anointed high priest do not require bringing near, since no handful is taken out of them, and where no handful is taken out bringing near is not necessary.

Explanation 
Section one: As was the format in mishnah three, the mishnah begins by noting that all of the combinations with regard to requiring bringing near and waving are possible.
Section two: These minhahs are brought near to the altar, but they are not waved. The list is the same as that in section one of mishnah three.
Section three: Rabbi Shimon says that since the minhahs of the priests and of the anointed high priest are not eaten at all, but rather are entirely burned, they need not be brought near to the altar. Rather they are just put on the altar and burned.
