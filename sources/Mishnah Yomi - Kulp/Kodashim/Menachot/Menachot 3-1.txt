Menahot, Chapter Three, Mishnah One

Introduction
This mishnah deals with various cases where the disqualifying intention does not cause the sacrifice to be invalid. The same mishnah concerning animal sacrifices appeared in Zevahim 3:3.

Mishnah One
If he took the handful from the minhah intending to eat [outside its proper place or after its proper time] a thing that it is not usual to eat or to burn [outside its proper place or after its proper time] a thing that it is not usual to burn, the offering is valid.
But Rabbi Eliezer says it is invalid. 
If he intended to eat less than an olive's worth of a thing that it is usual to eat, or to burn   less than an olive's worth of a thing that it is usual to burn, the offering is valid. 
If he intended to eat a half of an olive's worth and to burn a half of an olive’s worth, the offering is valid, for eating and burning cannot be reckoned together.

Explanation
Section one:  Normally, having an intention to eat or burn something outside of the place or time it should be eaten or burned will invalidate the minhah. However, here he intends to burn or eat something that is not normally burned or eaten. Therefore, this improper intention does not render the sacrifice invalid. Rabbi Eliezer disagrees and holds that an improper intention even concerning that which is not normally eaten or burned will still render the sacrifice invalid. 
Section two: Here his improper intention was to do the action with less than an olive’s worth of the minhah, and therefore the minhah is still valid.
Section three: As we learned in 1:4, improper intentions with regard to eating a minhah and burning the fistful taken out of it do not join together to add up to the requisite olive’s worth. Therefore, the minhah is still valid.
