Menahot, Chapter Thirteen, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
In this case he pledged to bring a todah (thanksgiving offering) or a shelamim (well-being offering). The difference between these and the olah that we learned about in yesterday’s mishnah is that these sacrifices can also be female. Therefore, in certain circumstances he may have to bring a lot more animals. 

Mishnah Seven
[If one said,] “I take upon myself to offer a todah or a shelamim,” he must bring a lamb.
[If he said,] “I specified a beast of the herd but I do not know what it was I specified,” he must bring a bull and a cow, a bull calf and a heifer. 
[If he said, “I specified] a beast of the cattle but I do not know what it was I specified,” he must bring a bull and a cow, a bull calf and a heifer, a ram and a ewe, a he-goat and a she-goat, a he-kid and a she-kid, a he-lamb and a ewe-lamb.

Explanation
Section one: This is the same rule as found in section one of yesterday’s mishnah.
Section two: This is also the same as yesterday’s mishnah, except here he must be concerned lest he pledged to bring a female animal. Thus he must bring a bull and a cow (female) and he must bring a bull calf and a heifer (a young female).
Section three: So too here, where he might have pledged a flock or herd animal, he must bring female animals as well. This will be very expensive as he will have to bring 12 animals, any of which might have been his pledge.
