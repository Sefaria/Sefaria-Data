Menahot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
There are three [periods of gathering in the] olives and each crop gives three kinds of oil.  
The first crop of olives is when the olives are picked from the top of the tree; they are pounded and put into the basket.
Rabbi Judah says: around the basket.   
This gives the first oil. 
They are then pressed with the beam 
Rabbi Judah says: with stones.   
This gives the second oil. 
They are then ground and pressed again.
This gives the third oil. 
The first [oil] is fit for the candlestick and the others for menahot. 
The second crop is when the olives at roof-level are picked from the tree; they are pounded and put into the basket.
Rabbi Judah says: around the basket.   
This gives the first oil. 
They are then pressed with the beam 
Rabbi Judah says: with stones.   
This gives the second oil. 
They are then ground and pressed again.
This gives the third oil. 
The first [oil] is fit for the candlestick and the others for menahot. 
The third crop is when the last olives of the tree are packed inside the house until they become overripe; they are then taken up and dried on the roof they are pounded and put into the basket.
Rabbi Judah says: around the basket.   
This gives the first oil. 
They are then pressed with the beam 
Rabbi Judah says: with stones.   
This gives the second oil. 
They are then ground and pressed again.
This gives the third oil. 
The first [oil] is fit for the candlestick and the others for menahot. 

Explanation
Section one: There are three different ways of picking the olives off of the trees, and each way provides three different qualities of oil. The mishnah now lists each way and the quality of oil that is produced in each way. 
Section two: The first picking is done from the olives on the tops of the trees. First they are picked, then crushed and put into baskets. The oil flows from the baskets into a vessel underneath. Rabbi Judah says that the crushed olives are placed around the basket and that the oil will then enter the basket through the holes in the basket. This is the first oil, which I believe we call the extra virgin oil.
The second oil comes from what is pressed out of the baskets. The first opinion holds that this pressing is done with a wooden beam, whereas Rabbi Judah (who must have had his own olive press!) says it is done with stones. This is the virgin olive oil, second best.
After the first pressing, they would again grind the olives and press them again. This would be the regular olive oil. 
The first type of oil is good enough to be used for lighting the menorah. The second and third types could be used for menahot.
Section three: The second crop was done with the olives was done with the olives that were at the height of the rooftops. The processing of these olives is the same as that with the first crop.
Section four: The third crop was done with the olives on the lowest part of the tree. These olives will not ripen on their own on the tree and therefore they are packed inside the house until they become overripe and the oil begins to seep out. Henceforth, their processing is the same as the olives that ripen on the tree.
