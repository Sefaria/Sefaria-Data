Menahot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah discusses what kinds of fields are used to grow the grain to make flour for menahot.

Mishnah Two 
One may not bring [grain for menahot] from the produce of a manured field or from an irrigated field or from a field stocked with trees.
But if one did bring it [from these] it was valid. 
How was it prepared? In the first year it was plowed and in the second year it was sown seventy days before Pesah, thus it would produce fine flour in abundance. 
How was it tested? The temple-treasurer used to thrust his hand into it; if some dust came up in [his hand] it was invalid, until it was sifted [more]. 
If it had become magotty it is invalid.

Explanation
Section one: The grain used for the minhah must come from a field that is irrigated by rainwater. It cannot come from a field that requires manure to fertilize it or from a field that is artificially irrigated. It also cannot come from a field that also grows trees because the trees weaken the quality of the field. 
Section two: While the grain should not be brought from such a field, if it is, the minhah is still valid. 
Section three: This section describes how the special field set aside to grow grain for the minhah was prepared. The reason that it was sown before Pesah is that this is the time of the year for sowing fields in Israel.
Section four: This is how the flour was tested to see if it had been sifted well enough to be used for the minhah.
Section five: Maggoty (or wormy) flour is obviously not fit to be used in the preparation of the sacred minhah (and itâ€™s a bit gross as well, although I suppose it was hard to avoid in the ancient world).
