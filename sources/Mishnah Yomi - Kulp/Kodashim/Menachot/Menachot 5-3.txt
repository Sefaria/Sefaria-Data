Menahot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah teaches which minhah requires oil and frankincense, which requires one of the two, and which require neither. 

Mishnah Three
Some [minhahs] require oil and frankincense, some require oil but not frankincense, some frankincense but not oil, and some neither oil nor frankincense. 
These require oil and frankincense: the minhah of fine flour, that prepared on a griddle, that prepared in a pan, the cakes and the wafers, the minhah of the priests, the minhah of the anointed high priest, the minhah of a gentile, the minhah of women, and the minhah of the omer.  
The minhah offered with the drink-offerings requires oil but not frankincense. 
The showbread requires frankincense but not oil. 
The two loaves, the sinner's minhah and the minhah of jealousy require neither oil nor frankincense.

Explanation
Section one: As the mishnah typically loves to note, all of the possible combinations can actually occur. I shall give references for each of these types of minhahs.
Section two: 
The minhah of fine flour; that prepared on a griddle; that prepared in a pan: Leviticus 2:1.
The cakes and the wafers:  Leviticus 2:4.
The minhah of the priests: A priest who volunteers to bring one of these minhahs. 
The minhah of the anointed high priest: See above 4:5. 
The minhah of a gentile; the minhah of women: who volunteered to bring one of these minhahs. 
And the minhah of the omer: Leviticus 2:14-15. 
Section three:  Numbers 15:4ff.
Section four: Leviticus 24:7.
Section five: The two loaves are those brought on Shavuot. The sinnerâ€™s minhah is referred to in Leviticus 5:11 and the minhah of jealousy is that brought by the suspected adultress (the Sotah (Numbers 5:15). In both cases the Torah specifically states not to put frankincense or oil on them.
