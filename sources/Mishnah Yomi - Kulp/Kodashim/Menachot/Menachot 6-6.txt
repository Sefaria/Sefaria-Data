Menahot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah teaches how much flour was found in various types of menahot.

Mishnah Six
The omer consisted of one tenth [of an ephah of flour] taken from three se'ahs.
The two loaves consisted of two tenths taken from three se'ahs.
And the showbread consisted of twenty-four tenths taken from twenty-four se'ahs.

Explanations
Section one: The minhah of the omer, brought on the sixteenth of Nissan (at the end of the first day of Pesah), consisted of a tenth of an ephah of flour (we shall learn more about the omer in chapter ten). An ephah was equivalent to about 4 liters and in mishnaic measurement, an ephah was equivalent to three seahs. This one-tenth of an ephah was sifted out of three whole seahs of barley. This refined it until it was quite pure. It was necessary to refine the omer so thoroughly because barley grain has a high quantity of waste material. 
Section two: The two loaves brought on Shavuot each consisted of two-tenths of an ephah, as is stated in Leviticus 23:17. These two-tenths were sifted out of three ephahs. The reason that less sifting was needed is that these loaves came from wheat and not barley.
Section three: Each of the twelve loaves of the showbread consisted of two-tenths of an ephah of flour, as is stated in Leviticus 24:5, for a total of twenty-four tenths. Each tenth would have been sifted from one seah. The reason that less sifting is needed is that unlike the omer and the two loaves which must come from newly harvested barley or wheat, the showbread can come from the older harvest, which has less waste material than the new harvest.
