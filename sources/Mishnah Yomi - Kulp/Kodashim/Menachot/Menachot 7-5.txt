Menahot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah and the next deal with various laws governing one who vows to bring a todah sacrifice.

Mishnah Five 
One who says: “Behold I take upon myself [to bring] a todah”, he must bring both it and its bread from hullin.
[If he said:] “A todah from hullin and its bread from tithe,” he must bring the bread from hullin. 
[If he said:] “A todah from tithe and bread from hullin,” he may bring.
[If he said:] “A todah, it and its bread from tithe,” he may bring.
But he must not bring from grain of second tithe, rather from second tithe money. 

Explanation
Section one: If he vows to bring a todah, he must bring both it and its bread from hullin, non-sacred, sources. He cannot use second tithe money to purchase it or its bread. We will learn why in tomorrow’s mishnah. 
Section two: If he specifies that he will purchase the todah with hullin money, but that he wants to use second tithe money for the bread, he must still use hullin money to purchase both. When he said that he would bring a “todah from hullin” the word “todah” included the bread, so it too must be brought from hullin. His words “and its bread from tithe” don’t make any difference.
Section three: If he says that he wants to bring the todah from tithe, then he may do so. He can also bring the bread from hullin.
Section four: If he vows to bring both from tithe, he may do so. 
Section five: In the previous case, the animal that he brings for a todah will be purchased with second tithe money. Therefore, the bread should also be purchased with money used to redeem second tithe, and not with grain that was itself set aside to be second tithe. This way both the todah and the accompanying bread come from the exact same source.
