Menahot, Chapter Two, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with cases where a priest has a disqualifying intention with regard to one part of a multi-part sacrifice and whether this renders the entire sacrifice piggul and the one who eats it liable for karet.

Mishnah Three 
The todah can render the bread piggul but the bread does not render the todah piggul. 
How so? If he slaughtered the todah intending to eat part of it on the next day, both it and the bread are piggul; if he intended to eat part of the bread the next day, the bread is piggul but the todah is not piggul.
The lambs can render the bread piggul but the bread cannot render the lambs piggul. 
How so? If he slaughtered the lambs intending to eat part of them the next day, both they and the bread are piggul; if he intended to eat part of the bread the next day, the bread is piggul but the lambs are not.

Explanation
Section one: When one brings a todah (thanksgiving) offering, he brings with it unleavened cakes of bread (see Leviticus 7:12). If the priest intends to eat the todah after its time has expired, the bread is also rendered piggul. This is because the todah is the main part and the loaves are ancillary to it. However, if he intends to eat the loaves after their time has expired, then the loaves alone are piggul and the todah is not. The rule is that the main part can render that which is ancillary to it piggul, but the ancillary part cannot render the main part of the sacrifice piggul.
Section two: This is the same rule as above but applied to the lambs that are sacrificed on Shavuot and the loaves that accompany them (see yesterdayâ€™s mishnah). The lambs are the main part and the bread is ancillary.
