Menahot, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah One

Introduction
This mishnah deals with the baking of the two loaves used on Shavuot (see above 10:6) and the showbread (see above 6:5-7). 

Mishnah One
The two loaves [of Shavuot] were kneaded each on its own and baked each on its own. 
The [cakes of the] showbread were kneaded each on its own and baked two at a time. 
They were prepared in a mould, and when they were taken out from the oven they were again put in a mould lest they become damaged.

Explanation
Section one: The two loaves used on Shavuot (Leviticus 23:17) must be kneaded on their own and baked on their own. However, the cakes used for the showbread (Leviticus 24:5-9) must also be kneaded on their own, but they are baked two at a time. These rules are derived through midrashic readings of various verses.
Section two: The cakes of the showbread were baked in a mould to give them a specific shape. After they were taken out of the oven, they were put into another mould so that they would not break.
