Menahot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah One

Introduction
The first five mishnayot of our chapter deal with the size of the measuring vessels used in the Temple.

Mishnah One
There were two dry-measures in the Temple: the tenth and the half-tenth.    
Rabbi Meir says: a tenth, [another] tenth, and a half-tenth. 
For what purpose did the tenth measure serve? 
By it they used to measure all the menahot. 
One did not measure with a three-tenths measure [the minhah] for a bull or with a two-tenths measure [the minhah] for a ram, rather, one measured them by all by tenths. 
For what purpose did the half-tenth measure serve? 
By it one used to measure the griddlecakes of the high priest [which was offered] half in the morning and the half towards evening.

Explanation
Section one: When it came to measuring dry things, i.e. grain, there were two measuring vessels in the Temple, one that contained a tenth of an ephah, and one that contained half of a tenth. The remainder of the mishnah will explain what they were used for.
According to Rabbi Meir, there were three dry-measures. One held a tenth when it was heaped over, and one held precisely a tenth when it was measured out evenly. The heaped over one would be used for all menahot, and the smoothed out one would be used for the griddlecakes of the high priest, which had to be divided into two halves. This was preferable for if they used the heaped over measure to split into two, some of the grain might spill out.
Section two: The one-tenth measuring vessel was used for all menahot.
Section three: Some menahot require more than one tenth, but there were not special measuring vessels that held three or two tenths. Rather they would just fill the one-tenth measuring vessel two or three times.
Section four: The half-tenth measure was used for the griddle-cakes of the high priest (see Menahot 4:4), half of which was offered in the morning and half in the evening.
