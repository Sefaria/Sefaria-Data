Menahot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
In this mishnah Rabbi Shimon compares three sacrifices and three requirements, with each sacrifice requiring two of the three requirements. We should note that Rabbi Shimon seems more interested in the curious fact that three sacrifices can be compared in this manner than in the actual rules that apply to these sacrifices. Perhaps the mishnah is somewhat of a mnemonic, a means by which to remember certain rules. Alternatively it is just a neat fact that Rabbi Shimon enjoyed relating.
Instead of explaining the mishnah line by line, I will be explaining it all at once below.   

Mishnah Seven
Rabbi Shimon says, there are three kinds [of sacrifices] which require three commandments; two [of the three] apply to each kind, but none of them require a third. 
And these are they: the shelamim of the individual, the shelamim of the community   and the asham of the leper. 
The shelamim of the individual requires the laying on of hands for the living animal and waving after it is slaughtered, but it does not require waving while alive. 
The shelamim of the community requires waving while alive and also after it is slaughtered, but it does not require the laying on of hands. 
The asham of the leper requires the laying on of hands and also waving while alive, but it does not require waving after it is slaughtered.

Explanation
The three sacrifices under discussion in this mishnah are 1) the shelamim brought by an individual (Leviticus 7:11ff); 2) the shelamim brought by the community on Shavuot (Leviticus 23:20); 3) and the asham brought by the leper (Leviticus 14:14). The three commandments are: 1) waving while the animal is alive; 2) waving after slaughtering; 3) laying on of the hands (see Leviticus 3:2). All three sacrifices require two of the three commandments, but none of the sacrifices require all three actions.
