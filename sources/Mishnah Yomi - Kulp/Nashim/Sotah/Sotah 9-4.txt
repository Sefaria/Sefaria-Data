Sotah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Four

Introduction
In today’s mishnah we learn from what part of the body they would measure in order to determine the closest city.

Mishnah Four
From what part [of the body] do they measure? 
Rabbi Eliezer says: from the navel.
Rabbi Akiva says: from the nose. 
Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: from the place where he was made a slain person, from the neck.

Explanation
Rabbi Eliezer’s and Rabbi Akiva’s opinion directly parallel their opinions in yesterday’s mishnah.  Rabbi Eliezer said that the head is brought to the body, and here he says that the distance is measured from the center of the body, from the navel.  Rabbi Akiva said that the body is brought to the head, and here he says that it is measured from the center of the head, from the nose.
Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob determines the point from where we measure using another principle.  A person’s life blood was considered to be in his neck.  This can be observed by the fact that slicing a person’s neck causes them to die much quicker than slicing a leg or arm.  Since the life-giving blood is found in the neck, the distance to the city is measured from that point.
