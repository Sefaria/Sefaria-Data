Yevamoth, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah defines the terms petzua dakkah and kerut shofkhah mentioned in Deuteronomy 23:2.  These two categories of men cannot marry full Israelite women.  

Mishnah Two
Who is considered a “petzua dakkah”?   
Anyone whose testes are wounded even one of them. 
And a “kerut shofkhah”? 
A man whose member is cut off. 
If [any part] of the corona remained, even so much as a hair’s breadth, the man is regarded as fit [to serve as a priest].
A man who testes are wounded, and one whose member is cut off, are permitted to marry a convert or a freed slave. 
They are only forbidden to enter into the congregation, as it is said “No one whose testes are crushed or whose member is cut off shall be admitted into the congregation of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:2).

Explanation
Section one:  A “petzua dakkah” is one who has even one of his testes wounded.
Section two:  A “kerut shofkha” is one whose penis has been cut off.  However, if any of the crown remains, he is still a valid priest.
Section three:  These two categories of men are permitted to marry converts and freed slaves, who according to this mishnah, are not considered to be part of “the congregation of the Lord”.  Only those born as fit Israelites are considered to be part of “the congregation of the Lord”.
