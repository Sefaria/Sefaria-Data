Yevamoth, Chapter Four, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah is the final clause of yesterday’s mishnah, which discusses the shomeret yavam.

Mishnah Four
If he married her she is his wife in every respect save that her ketubah remains a debt on her first husband’s estate.

Explanation
When the yavam has yibbum with the shomeret yavam, she becomes his wife in every respect.  If he wishes to divorce her he must give her a get and she doesn’t require halitzah.  He can remarry her after divorcing her (provided she doesn’t remarry in between) and she is not forbidden as “his brother’s wife”.  When she dies he inherits her.
The only difference between her and a regular wife is that if he dies or divorces her, the ketubah is paid from the estate of the first husband.  In any case, the rabbis declared that if the dead brother died penniless, the yavam must pay for her ketubah.
