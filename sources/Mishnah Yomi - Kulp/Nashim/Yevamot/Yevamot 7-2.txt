Yevamoth, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah continues to discuss slaves that are part of a wife’s dowry and their ability to eat terumah, which depends on her status as a daughter of an Israelite or a priest, as well as the status of her husband, Israelite or priest.

Mishnah Two
If the daughter of an Israelite was married to a priest, and she brought him in slaves, they are permitted to eat terumah whether they are melog slaves, or tzon barzel slaves.  
If the daughter of a priest was married to an Israelite and she brought him in slaves, they may not eat terumah whether they are melog slaves or tzon barzel slaves. 

Explanation
Section one:  When the daughter of an Israelite marries a priest she is allowed to eat terumah.  The melog slaves (see yesterday’s mishnah for a definition of melog and tzon barzel) may eat terumah because they belong to her and she eats terumah.  The tzon barzel slaves may eat terumah because they belong to her husband who is a priest, and a priest’s slaves eat terumah.
Section two:  When the daughter of a kohen is married to an Israel, she forfeits her right to eat terumah.  Her melog slaves cannot continue to eat terumah because they are owned by her and she cannot eat.  The tzon barzel slaves belong to the husband, who obviously cannot eat nor give them terumah.
