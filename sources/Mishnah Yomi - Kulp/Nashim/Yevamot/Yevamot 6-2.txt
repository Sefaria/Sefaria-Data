Yevamoth, Chapter Six, Mishnah Two

Introduction
While the previous mishnah served as a quasi-summary to the preceding chapters which all dealt with yibbum, our mishnah serves as a bridge to a new topic:  forbidden relationships, specifically women who are forbidden to priests.  We will deal with these laws for the next four chapters of Mishnah.

Mishnah Two
Similarly, one who has intercourse with any of the forbidden relatives listed in the Torah, or with any of those who are disqualified to marry him as, for instance, a widow to a high priest, a divorced woman or a halutzah to a common priest, a mamzeret or a netinah to an Israelite or the daughter of an Israelite to a mamzer or a nathin, he has disqualifed [her from marrying a priest], and the laws do not make a distinction between different types of intercourse.

Explanation
This mishnah states the same rule that was stated in the previous mishnah:  with regard to forbidden sexual relations, any sexual intercourse counts (i.e. unintentional, under compulsion, etc.).  
Furthermore, the point of our mishnah is that once a woman has had forbidden sexual intercourse, she can no longer marry a priest.  This is true whether the intercourse was forbidden because it was with a priest and she was forbidden to a priest, or if the intercourse was forbidden to Israelites as well (such as a mamzer and an Israelite).  In all cases the woman is forbidden to subsequently marry a priest. [Note that a mamzeret and a netinah could not in any case marry a priest.  This clause was taught here only to teach that it is forbidden to have any type of intercourse with a mamzeret or a netinah].
