Yevamoth, Chapter Four, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah is a direct continuation of the previous one.

Mishnah Six
If he wished to suspend [his decision] until a minor becomes of age, or until the eldest   returns from a country beyond the sea or [until a brother who was] a deaf-mute or an imbecile [should recover],  he is not to be listened to, but is told, “the commandment is upon you; either perform halitzah or yibbum.”
.
Explanation
If the eldest brother does not want to perform halitzah or yibbum, but rather wait until a younger brother becomes old enough to have yibbum with this woman, he is not listened to.  Rather he is told that he must either perform yibbum or halitzah.  The mishnah teaches that it is not fair to the woman to keep her waiting for halitzah.  She has the right to be released now, so that she can go and marry whomever she wants.  
Similarly, if one of the younger brothers wants to wait for an older brother to return from abroad, or recover from deafness or from being an imbecile (this may be some sort of temporary insanity), they do not listen to him and force him to do yibbum or halitzah immediately. 
Note that a deaf-mute and an imbecile cannot contract yibbum or any type of marriage because they are considered to lack intelligence.  As I have pointed out before, in mishnaic times real sign language did not exist, and therefore deaf-mutes could not really communicate.  Now that sign language has been developed it is recognized that deaf-mutes do not inherently lack intelligence and they may contract marriage.
