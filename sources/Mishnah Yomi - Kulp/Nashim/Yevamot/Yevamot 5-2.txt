Yevamoth, Chapter Five, Mishnah Two

Introduction
The remainder of the chapter gives various scenarios of a yavam’s releasing his yevamah from the necessity for yibbum.  In order to understand these mishnayoth, it is important to keep in mind that a get (a divorce document) severs the ties created by ma’amar (an act of betrothal) and halitzah severs the ties created by the need for yibbum.

Mishnah Two
How [is the release from yibbum effected]? 
If he performed ma'amar for his yevamah and gave her a get, she requires halitzah.   
If he performed ma'amar and and did halizah, she requires a get.   
If he performed ma’amar and then had intercourse with her, behold this is in accordance with the commandment.

Explanation
Section one:  When the yavam performed ma’amar he made the yevamah into his betrothed wife.  When he subsequently gives her the get, he has ended the ties created by ma’amar.  Since he never did yibbum or halitzah, she still requires halitzah to sever the ties created by the need for yibbum.  He could not have yibbum with her because she is already his divorcee.
Section two:  If he did ma’amar and then halitzah, she still needs a get to sever the ties created by the ma’amar.  The halitzah is not sufficient to break the betrothal created by ma’amar.  He cannot marry her because she is his halutzah.      
Section three:  The normal, prescribed means of fulfilling the mitzvah of yibbum is for the yavam first to perform ma’amar and then, assumedly some time later, for them to have sexual relations.  This is the same way that normal marriage is enacted: first the betrothal is done and then the couple begins to live together, today symbolized by the huppah (the wedding canopy).  Since some time in the middle ages, Jews have combined the betrothal ceremony and the marriage proper into one event.
