Yevamoth, Chapter Three, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah continues to discuss variations that could arise from the scenario brought up in mishnah one.

Mishnah Two 
If one of the sisters was forbidden to one [of the brothers] under the prohibition of incest, he is forbidden to marry her but may marry her sister, while the second brother is forbidden to marry either of them.
[If one sister] was forbidden due to a commandment or due to holiness they both perform halitzah and may not be taken in yibbum.

Explanation
Section one:  If one of the sister’s was forbidden to one of the remaining brothers because of one of the various incest laws, for instance he was already married to her daughter, she is not liable to have yibbum with him (as we learned in chapter one).  Therefore he can marry the other sister, for she is not the sister of his z’kukah.  Nevertheless, the other brother, to whom neither sister is forbidden, is still prohibited from marrying either sister, since each is the sister of his z’kukah.
Section two:  In chapter two, mishnayoth two and three, we learned that there are two other categories of forbidden relationships besides primary incest prohibitions:  secondary incest relationships prohibitions and prohibitions due to the inherent holiness of the priests (for instance divorcees are forbidden to priests) or of all of Israel (for instance the prohibition of a mamzer). If one of the sisters was forbidden to one of the remaining brothers due to one of these prohibitions, for instance he was a priest (and his paternal brothers were not), or he was a mamzer (and his paternal brothers were not) the two sisters must have halitzah and cannot have yibbum.  This accords with what we learned in chapter two, that in any case where a woman becomes liable to have yibbum with a man prohibited to her due to a commandment or holiness, she must have halitzah and not yibbum.
