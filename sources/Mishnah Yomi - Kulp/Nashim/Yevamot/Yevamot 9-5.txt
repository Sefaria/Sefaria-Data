Yevamoth, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Five

Introduction
As with all of the mishnayoth of this chapter, we donâ€™t really learn any new information in this mishnah.  What we see is a tightly organized literary structure, describing a situation where one woman moves in and out of the ability to eat terumah and tithe.

Mishnah Five
The daughter of an Israelite married to a priest may eat terumah. 
If he died and she has a son by him she may continue to eat terumah. 
If she was [subsequently] married to a Levite, she may eat tithe.   
If he died and she had a son by him, she may continue to eat tithe. 
If she was [subsequently] married to an Israelite she may eat neither terumah nor tithe. 
If he died and she has a son by him, she may eat neither terumah nor tithe. 
If her son by the Israelite died, she may again eat tithe. 
If her son by the Levite died she may again eat terumah. 
If her son by the priest died, she may eat neither terumah nor tithe.

Explanation
When the Israelite woman married the priest, she became able to eat terumah.  Once he dies, she can still eat terumah because she has a son from him.  When she marries a Levite she loses the ability to eat terumah, but she gains the ability to eat tithe.  When he dies, she can still eat tithe because she has a son from him.  When she then marries the Israelite, she loses her right to eat both tithe and terumah, because she has a son with him.  
At this point she has a son from each of her marriages.  If her son from the Israelite now dies, she reverts back to her previous status.  She can now eat tithe because of her son with the Levite.  If this son dies, she now reverts to the previous status, which means she can again eat terumah because of her son with the priest.  If he too dies, she goes back to her original Israelite family and can no longer eat tithe or terumah.
