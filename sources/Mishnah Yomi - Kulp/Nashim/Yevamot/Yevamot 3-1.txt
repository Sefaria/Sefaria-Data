Yevamoth, Chapter Three, Mishnah One

Introduction
Mishnayoth one through four are all one long mishnah dealing with a case of four brothers, whom we will call, Reuven, Shimon, Levi and Judah, two of whom married two sisters, Rachel and Leah.

Mishnah One
Four brothers: two of whom were married to two sisters, if those who were married to the sisters died, behold these must perform halitzah but may not have yibbum.   
If they preemptively married them, they must divorce them. 
Rabbi Eliezer said: Beth Shammai holds that they may retain them, and Beth Hillel holds that they must divorce them.

Explanation
Section one:  Reuven and Shimon marry Rachel and Leah and then both die.  Rachel and Leah are technically liable for yibbum or halitzah with either Levi or Judah.  The mishnah teaches that neither Levi nor Judah may have yibbum with either sister, because each sister is the sister of his z’kukah (a woman with whom he is liable to have either yibbum or halitzah).  In other words Leah is liable to have yibbum or halitzah with each brother as is Rachel.  They are both considered to be “z’kukah” to both brothers.  If Levi or Judah were to have yibbum with either one, he would be having relations with the sister of his z’kukah, which is forbidden just as it is forbidden to have relations with one’s wife’s sister.  Even after one sister has had halitzah with one of the other brothers, thereby ending her status as z’kukah, the other may not have yibbum because any one woman is forbidden to him at the time when she becomes liable for yibbum, remains forbidden forever.
Section two:  If the brothers did marry the sisters, against the ruling in clause one, they must divorce them.  Although the marriage is valid and therefore requires a divorce, it is forbidden and therefore a divorce is mandatory.
Section three:  According to Rabbi Eliezer, the previous ruling is only according to Beth Hillel.  Beth Shammai disagrees and rules that the marriage may be upheld.
