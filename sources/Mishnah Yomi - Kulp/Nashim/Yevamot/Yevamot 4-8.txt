Yevamoth, Chapter Four, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah continues to teach that it is forbidden to marry the sister of one’s halutzah.  

Mishnah Eight
If he performed halitzah for his yevamah, and his brother married her sister and died, she must perform halitzah but may not be taken in yibbum. 
Similarly if a man divorces his wife and his brother marries her sister and dies—behold she is exempt from halitzah and from yibbum. 

Explanation
Section one:  If Reuven performs halitzah for Rachel (who had been married to Shimon) and then Levi marries Leah, Rachel’s sister, and then Levi dies, Leah now falls in front of Reuven for yibbum or halitzah.  Since Leah is the sister of his halutzah, Rachel, Reuven cannot have yibbum with her.  However, since the prohibition of the sister of one’s halutzah is only of rabbinic origin (derabbanan), she must have halitzah and is not totally exempt. 
Section two:  Similarly, if Reuven divorces Rachel, and Shimon marries Leah and then Shimon dies childless, Leah is exempt from both halitzah and yibbum, since she is the sister of his former wife.  Since this is biblically prohibited, Leah does not even need to have halitzah.
