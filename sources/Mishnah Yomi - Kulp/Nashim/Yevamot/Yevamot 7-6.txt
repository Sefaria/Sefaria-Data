Yevamoth, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah introduces the strange case where a woman can have a grandson who is a high priest and that high priest actually disqualifies her from eating terumah.

Mishnah Six
A high priest sometimes disqualifies [his mother’s mother] from being able to eat terumah. 
How is this so? If a priest’s daughter was married to an Israelite and she bore a daughter by him, and the daughter went and married a priest and bore a son by him, such a son is fit to be a high priest, to stand and serve at the altar.  
He allows his mother to eat terumah but disqualifies his mother’s mother. 
And she can say, “[May there] not be like my grandson the high priest who disqualified me from eating terumah.”

Explanation
If the daughter of a priest marries an Israelite, she loses the right to eat terumah as long as he is alive or she has a descendent through him.  When she has a daughter and the daughter goes and marries a priest and has a son the son is a priest and is eligible to become a high priest.  If his father dies, his mother may continue to eat terumah, because she has had a son.  If his mother also dies, and his grandmother did not have any other children, she does not return to her father’s home (remember her father was a priest) to eat terumah, because she has a grandson through her marriage to the Israelite.  Although her grandson might even be a high priest, he still prevents his grandmother from eating terumah. 
The mishnah then brings up the strange possible complaint of a grandmother, who has a grandson who is the high priest, and yet he disqualifies her from eating terumah.  I imagine that if this was my Bubby, she would have gotten over the loss of terumah and just been proud of her grandson!
