Yevamoth, Chapter Four, Mishnah Twelve

Introduction
Our mishnah begins to discuss the definition of a mamzer, the child of an illicit union.  The question that is asked is:  which illicit unions produce children that are considered mamzers?  
 
Mishnah Twelve
A man who remarried his divorced wife, or married his halutzah, or married the relative of his halutzah must divorce her, and the child is a mamzer; the words of Rabbi Akiva. 
But the Sages say: the child is not a mamzer. 
They agree that where a man married the relative of his divorcee the child is a mamzer.

Explanation
According to Deuteronomy 24:2-4 if a man divorces his wife and she remarries and then is divorced or widowed, the first husband may not remarry her.  
As we have seen throughout this tractate a man may not marry his halutzah or the relative of his halutzah (for instance her mother or daughter).  
Rabbi Akiva says that if the man does transgress and marry one of these women he must divorce her and the child is a mamzer.  As we shall see in the next mishnah, Rabbi Akiva holds that the child of any illegal union is a mamzer.
The Sages disagree and hold that the child is not a mamzer.  As we shall see in the next mishnah, the Sages hold that a union that is a transgression of a negative commandment that is not punished by death or kareth does not create a mamzer.  Since these transgressions are not punished by kareth, the child is not a mamzer. Furthermore, the prohibition of the sister of one’s halutzah is only derabbanan (of rabbinic origin) and therefore the child cannot be a mamzer.
Marrying the relative of one’s divorcee is biblically prohibited and is punishable by kareth.  Therefore the Sages agree with Rabbi Akiva that the child is a mamzer.
