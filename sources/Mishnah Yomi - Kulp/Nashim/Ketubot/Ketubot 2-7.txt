Ketuboth, Chapter Two, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah illustrates the same principle employed in yesterday’s mishnah, but uses the example of men who claim to be priests.  

Mishnah Seven
And likewise two men, [if] one says, “I am a priest”, and the other says, “I am a priest”, they are not believed.   
But when they testify about one another, they are believed.

Explanation
Section one:  When each man claims to be a priest, neither is believed and neither will receive terumah.  Just as in  yesterday’s mishnah, where a woman could not testify with regard to her own personal status, so too in today’s mishnah a man cannot testify with regard to his own status.
Section two:  However, if both men corroborate the other’s testimony they are believed.
