Mishnah. All the substitutes for [the formulas of] vows have the validity of vows.  Those for haramim are like haramim,  Those for oaths are like oaths, and those for neziroth are like neziroth.  If one says to his neighbour, ‘i am debarred from You by a vow, [or] i am separated from you,’ [or] ‘i am removed from you, in respect of aught  That i might eat of yours or that i might taste of yours,’ he is prohibited. If he says: i am banned to you,’ then r. Akiba was inclined to give a stringent rulIng. 
Mishnah. [if one says] ‘as the vows of the wicked, he has vowed in respect of neziroth, a sacrifice, and an oath.  [If he says:] ‘as the vows of the righteous,’ his words are of no effect. [but if he said,] ‘as their freewill-offerings,’ he has vowed in respect of a nazirite vow and a sacrifice. 
	Mishnah. One who says, ‘konam,’ ‘konah,’ or ‘konas,’   These are the Substitutes for korban.   ‘Herek,’ ‘herek,’ [or] ‘heref,’ these are substitutes for herem.   ‘Nazik,’ ‘naziah,’ ‘paziah,’ these are substitutes for neziroth;   ‘Shebuthah,’ ‘shekukah,’ or one who vows by mohi,   These are substitutes for shebu'ah.  
. MiShnah. If one says [to his neighbour], ‘that which i might eat of yours be not   Hullin,’   ‘Be not kasher,’   ‘Be not pure,’ ‘be clean or unclean,’   ‘Be nothar,’   Or piggul,   He is forbidden.   As the lamb,’   As the temple sheds of cattle or wood,’   ‘As the wood’ [on the altar], as the fire [on the altar],’   ‘ As the altar,’ ‘as the temple, as jerusalem;’ [or] if one vowed by reference to the altar utensils,   Though he did not mention korban, it is as though he had vowed by korban.   R. Judah said: He who says jerusalem   Has said nothing.
Mishnah. If one says [to his neighbour], ‘that which i might eat of yours be korban’, [or]’ a burnt-offering’,   [Or] ‘a meal-offering’, [or]’ a sin-offering [or] ‘a thanksgiving-offering’, [or]’ a peace-offering, — he is forbidden.   R. Judah permitted [Him].   [If he says,] ‘the korban,’ [or] ‘as a korban,’ [or]’ korban,   Be that which i might eat of yours,’ he is forbidden.   If he says: that which i might not eat of yours be for a korban,’   R. Meir forbids [him].
Mishnah. If one says to his neighbouR, ‘konam be my mouth speaking with you,’ [or] ‘my hands working for you,’ [or] ‘my feet walking with you,’ he is forbidden. 
Mishnah. Now these are permitted:   [He who says,] what i might eat of yours be hullin,’ ‘as the flesh of the swine, as the object of idolatrous worship,’   As perforated hides,’   ‘As nebeloth and terefoth’,   As abominations and reptiles, as aaron's dougH or his terumah’,   — [In all these cases] he is permitted. If one says to his wife, ‘behold! Thou art unto me as my mother,’   He must be given an opening on other grounds,   In order that he should not act frivolously in such matters.  
	Mishnah. [if One says,] ‘konam if i sleep’, ‘if i speak’, or ‘if i walk’;  Or if one says to his wife, ‘konam if i cohabit with you,’ he is liable to [the injunction] he shall not break his word. 
	Mishnah. [if he says,] ‘[i swear] an oath not to sleep, or, ‘talk,’ or, ‘walk,’ he is forbidden [to do so]. [if he says,] ‘a korban be what i might not eat of yours,’   [Or] ‘oh korban! If i eat of yours,’ [or] ‘what i might not eat of yours be not a korBan unto me,’ he is permitted [to eat of his neighbours’].
Mishnah. [if he says, ‘i take] an oath [that] i will not eat of yours,’ [or] ‘oh oath that  I eat of yours,’ [or ‘i take] no oath [that] i will not eat of yours,’  He is forbidden.
Mishnah. In these instances oaths are more rigorous than vows.   Yet there is [also] greater stringency in vows than in oaths. E.g., if one says, ‘konam be the sukkah that i make,’ or, ‘the lulab that i take, or, the tefillin   That i put on:’ [when exprEssed] as vows they are binding, but as oaths they are not, because one cannot swear to transgress the precepts.
	Mishnah. A vow within a vow is valid,  But not an oath within an oath. E.g., if one declares, ‘behold, i will be a nazir if i eat [this loaf].’ ‘I will be a nazir if i eat [this loaf],’ and then eats [it], he is liable in respect of each [vow].  But if he says, ‘i swear that i will not eat [this loaf],’ ‘i swear that i will not eat [this loaf],’ and then eats [it], he is liable [to punishment] For one [oath] only.
Mishnah. Unspecified vows are interpreted strictly, but if specified,  Leniently. E.g., if one vows, behold! This be to me as salted meat,’ or, ‘as wine of libation’: now, if he vowed by allusion to a peaceoffering,  He is forbidden;  If by an idolatrous sacrifice, he is permitted, but if it was unspecified, he is forbidden. [if one declares], ‘behold! This be to me as herem’: if as a herem to the lord,  He is forbidden; if as a herem to the priests, he is permitted.  If it is unspecifIed, he is forbidden. ‘behold! This be to me as tithe’: if he vowed, as cattle tithes, he is forbidden; if as corn tithes, he is permitted; if unspecified, he is forbidden.  ‘Behold! This be to me as terumah’;  If he vowed, as the terumah of the temple-chaMber,  He is forbidden; if as the terumah of the threshing-floor [i.e., of corn]. He is permitted;  If unspecified, he is forbidden: this is the view of r. Meir. R. Judah said; an unspecified reference to terumah in judea   Is binding, but not in galilee, Because the galileans are unfamiliar with the terumah of the temple-chamber.   Unqualified allusions to haramim in judea are not binding. But in galilee they are, because the galileans are unfamiliar with priestly haramim.  
Mishnah. If one views by herem,  And then says, ‘i vowed only by a fishing net’,  By korban, and then says, i vowed only by royal gifts’,  [If he says] behold! [i myself] ‘azmi be a korban’,  And then states. ‘i vowed only by the ezem [bone] which i keep for the purpose of vowing’;  [IF one says,] ‘konam be any benefit my wife has of me, and then declares, i spoke only of my first wife, whom i have divorced (if none of these [vows] do they require to seek absolution.  But if a request for absolution is preferred, they are punished and tReated strictly: this is the view of r. Meir, but the sages say: they are given an opening [for regret] (in other grounds.  And they are admonished so that they do not treat vows with levity.
Ishnah. Four types of vows have the sages invalidated;   Viz., Vows incentive, vows of exaggeration, vows in error, and vows [broken] under pressure.   Vows incentive: e.g., if one was selling an article and said, konam that i do not let you have it for less than a sela’’; and the other replied, konam that i do Not give you more than a shekel —Both are agreed upon three denarii. 
	Mishnah. R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: also he  Who wishes to subject his friend to a vow to eat with him, should declare: every vow which i may make in the future shall be null’. [his vows are then invalid,] providing that he remembers this at the time of the vow.
	Mishnah. Vows of exaggeration: wheN one says, ‘konam if i did not see on this road as many as departed from egypt, or ‘if i did not see a serpent like the beam of an olive press.
Mishnah. Vows in error: [if one says, ‘konam,] if i ate or drank, and then remembered that he had; or, ‘if i eat or drink,’ and then forgot [his vow] and ate or drank; [or] ‘konam be any benefit which my wife has of me, because she stole my purse or beat mY child, and it was subsequently learnt that she had not beaten him nor stolen; all these are vows in error. If a man saw people eating [his] figs and said to them, let the figs be a korban to you,’ and then discovered them to be his father or his brothers,  While others were with them too — beth shammai maintain: his father and brothers are permitted, but the rest are forbidden. Beth hillel rule: all are permitted.
Ishnah. Vows [broken] under pressure: if one subjected his neighbour to a vow, to dine with Him,  And then he or his son fell sick, or a river prevented him [from coming to him] — such is a vow [broken] under pressure.
	Mishnah. One may vow to murderers,   Robbers,   And publicans that it [the produce which they demand] is terumah, even if it is not,   Or that it belongs to the royal house, even if it does not. Beth shammai maintain: one may make any form of vow, Excepting that sustained by an oath;  But beth hillel Maintain: even such are permissible.  Beth shammai rule: he must not volunteer to vow;  Beth hillel rule: he may do so. Beth shammai say: [he may vow] only as far as he [the murderer, etc.] Makes him vow; beth hillel say: even in respect of what he does noT make him vow. E.g., if he [the robber] said to him, say: konam be any benefit my wife has of me’; and he declared, ‘konam be any benefit my wife and children have of me,’ — beth shammai rule: his wife is permitted, but his children are forbidden; beth hiLlel rule: both are permitted.
	Mishnah. [if one says,] ‘let these saplings be korban [i.e., consecrated] if they are not cut down’; or, let this garment be korban if it is not burnt: they can be redeemed.   [If he says,] ‘let these saplings be korban untIl they are cut down ; or, let this garment be korban until it is burnt’, They cannot be redeemed. 
Mishnah. He who vows [not to benefit] from seafarers, may benefit from land-dwellers; from land-dwellers, he is forbidden [to benefit] even from seafarers, because seafarers are included in the term land-dwellers’; not those who Merely travel from acco to jaffa,  But those who sail away great distances [from land].
	Mishnah. He who vows [not to benefit] from the seers of the sun, is forbidden from the blind too, because he meant those whom the sun sees’. 
	Mishnah. He who vows [not to  benefit] from the black-haired may not [benefit] from the bald and the grey-haireD, but may [benefit] from women and children, because only men are called blackhaired.
Mishnah. He who vows [not to benefit] from those who rest on the sabbath, is forbidden [to benefit] both from israelites and cutheans.  If he vows [not to benefit] from garlic eaters, he may not benefit from israelites and cutheans;  From those who go up  To jerusalem, he is forbidden [to benefit] from israelites but from cutheans he is permitted. 
	Mishnah. [if one says,] ‘konam that i do not benefit from the children of noah,’ he may benefit from israelites, but not from heathens.
Mishnah. [if one says, ‘konam] that i do not benefit from the seed of abraham,’ he is forbidden [to benefit] from israelites, but permitted [to benefit] from heathens.
Mishnah. [if one says, ‘konam] that i do not benefit from israelites’, he must buy thiNgs from them for more [than their worth] and sell them for less.   [If he says, ‘konam] if israelites benefit from me, he must buy from them for less and sell for more [than their worth], but none need consent to this.   That i may not benefit from them, Nor they from me, he may benefit only from heathens.  
	Mishnah. [if one says,] ‘konam that i do not benefit from the uncircumcised, he may benefit from uncircumcised israelites but not from circumcised heathens; that i do not benefit from the circumcised,’ he is forbidden to benefit from uncircumcised israeliTes but not from circumcised heathens, because ‘uncircumcised’ is a term applicable only to heathens, as it is written, for all the nations are uncircumcised and all the house of israel are uncircumcised in the heart.  And it is further said, and this unciRcumcised philistine shall be [as one of them],  And it is further said, lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.  R. Eleazar b. ‘azariah said: the foreskin is loathsome, since it is a term of opprobriUm for the wicked, as it is written, for all the nations are uncircumcised. R. Ishmael said, great is [the precept] of circumcision, since thirteen covenants were made thereon.  R. Jose said, circumcision is a great precept, for it overrides [the severity Of] the sabbath.   R. Joshua b. Karha said: great is [the precept of] circumcision. For [neglecting] which moses did not have [his punishment] suspended even for a single hour   . R. Nehemiah said, great is [the precept of] circumcision, since it supersedeS the laws of leprosy.   Rabbi said, great is circumcision, for [notwithstanding] all the precepts which abraham fulfilled he was not designated perfect until he circumcised himself, as it is written, walk before me, and be thou perfect.   Another explanatIon: great is circumcision, since but for that, the holy one, blessed be he, would not have created the universe, as it is written, but for my covenant by day and night,   I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth.
