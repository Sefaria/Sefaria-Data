Nazir, Chapter One, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Mishnah seven continues to teach that a person may make an extremely large number of nazirite vows, as we learned in mishnah four.

Mishnah Seven
[If one says], “Behold I am a nazirite, as the number of days in a solar year” he must count as many naziriteships as there are days in the solar year. 
Rabbi Judah said: such a case once occurred, and when the man had completed [his naziriteships], he died.

Explanation
This person took a vow to keep 365 naziriteships, and not one naziriteship of 365 days.  This is similar to the person who vowed to keep naziriteships like the hairs on his head.  After each thirty days he can shave, bring the sacrifices and begin counting again.
Rabbi Judah relates a story where this really happened, and after the 30 years of being a nazirite (365 times 30 days) the person died.  The point of his statement seems to be that if you make a vow of so many naziriteships, you will die by the time they are completed.
