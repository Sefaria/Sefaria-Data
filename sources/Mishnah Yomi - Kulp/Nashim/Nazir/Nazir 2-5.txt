Nazir, Chapter Two, Mishnah Five

Introduction
At the end of his naziriteship a nazirite brings three offerings, a sin offering, a burnt offering and well-being offering, and shaves his hair (Numbers 30:13-18).  Together these three offerings are called “the hair offering”, for they are accompanied by the shaving of the hair.  Our mishnah deals with a person who takes a nazirite vow and also accepts upon himself to bring another person’s “hair offering”.  

Mishnah Five
[If one says,] “Behold, I am a nazirite and I take it upon myself to bring the hair offering of another nazirite”,  and his friend heard and said “I too, and I take it upon myself to bring the hair offering of another nazirite”, then, if they are clever they will bring the other’s hair offering; otherwise they must bring hair offerings on behalf of other nazirites.

Explanation
In this case two people both take nazirite vows and in addition take it upon themselves to bring another person’s hair offering.  The mishnah teaches that each can bring each other’s offerings, and in that way each will have fulfilled all of his requirements without bringing more than one set of offerings.  However, if they do not bring each other’s offerings, each will have to bring a different person’s offerings, as well as his own.  This will end up costing them double.
