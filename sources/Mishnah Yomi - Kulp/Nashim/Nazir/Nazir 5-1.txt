Nazir, Chapter Five, Mishnah One

Introduction
This chapter deals with a person who made a nazirite vow based on a mistaken premise.  The chapter is introduced by two mishnayoth which discuss cases where one mistakenly consecrated property to the Temple.

Mishnah One
Beth Shammai says: something consecrated in error is consecrated; 
But Beth Hillel says: it is not consecrated. 
How is this so?
If someone says, “The black bull that leaves my house first shall be consecrated,” and a white one comes out, 
Beth Shammai says: it is consecrated, 
But Beth Hillel says: it is not consecrated.

Explanation
Section one:  This section outlines the basic debate, which shall be illustrated in the next section, and in the following mishnah.
Section two:  According to Beth Shammai, the white bull is consecrated.  When he said “the black bull” he meant the “first bull” but he assumed it would be a black one.  Since “something consecrated in error is consecrated”, he must give the white bull to the Temple.  Beth Hillel says that it is not consecrated, for he made a mistake in assuming that it would be a black bull.
