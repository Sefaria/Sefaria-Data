Nazir, Chapter Six, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Yesterday’s mishnah dealt with a nazirite who had to shave because he had become ritually defiled.  Today’s mishnah deals with a nazirite who has successfully completed his term of naziriteship, and is shaving as part of its completion, as is prescribed in Numbers 6.  In our mishnah two sages dispute when exactly he shaves during this process.

Mishnah Seven
Shaving in a case of purity:  How was it done? 
He would bring three animals, a sin-offering, a burnt-offering, and a well-being offering, slaughter the peace-offering and shave thereafter, the words of Rabbi Judah. 
Rabbi Elazar says: he shaves after the sin-offering, for in all cases [the sacrifice of] the sin-offering takes precedence.  
But if he shaved after [the slaughter] of any one of the three he has fulfilled his obligation.

Explanation
Section one:  Numbers 6:14 states that a nazirite upon completion of his naziriteship is to bring three sacrifices, as stated in the mishnah.  Verse 16-18 then state:  “The priest shall present them before the Lord and offer the sin offering and the burnt offering.  He shall offer the ram of sacrifice of well-being…The nazirite shall then cut his hair.”  Rabbi Judah therefore requires that all three sacrifices be offered before he cuts his hair.  This is the literal interpretation of the verse.
Section two:  In contrast, Rabbi Elazar holds that the nazirite should shave after the sacrifice of the sin-offering, for the sin-offering always takes precedence (see Leviticus 5:8).  To show that it takes precedence, Rabbi Elazar says that he should shave after its offering, before the other two sacrifices are offered.
Section three:  Nevertheless, if he shaved after any of the other offerings, both sages agree that he has fulfilled his obligation.
