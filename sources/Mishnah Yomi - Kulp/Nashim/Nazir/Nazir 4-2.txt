Nazir, Chapter Four, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with when a husband can annul his wife’s nazirite vow.

Mishnah Two
[If he says in conversation with his wife,] “Behold, I am a nazirite. What about you?” and she answers “Amen,” he can annul her vow, but his own remains binding. 
[But if she should say,] “Behold, I am a nazirite, what about you?” and he answers, “Amen,” he cannot annul her vow.

Explanation
Section one:  In this case, the husband has not confirmed his wife’s vow, but merely asked her if she would like to be a nazirite.  The question itself cannot be construed as a confirmation of her vow because she has not yet vowed.  Since he never confirmed her vow, he can annul it.
Section two:  However, if she says that she is a nazirite and then asks him if he too would like to be a nazirite and he says “Amen”, he has not only taken a nazirite vow, he has also confirmed her vow.  By doing so he has relinquished the right to later annul her vow.
