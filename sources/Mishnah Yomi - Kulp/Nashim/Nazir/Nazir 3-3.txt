Nazir, Chapter Three, Mishnah Three

Introduction
When a nazirite becomes impure he renders void the entire term of naziriteship that he has already observed.  He must purify himself in the standard procedure, which takes seven days.  He then shaves, brings a bird sacrifice and then he begins to count again (see Numbers 6:9-12). Our mishnah deals with one who has become impure on the thirtieth day of his nazirite period.  This person has not yet brought the sacrifices which he brings at the end of his naziriteship.  

Mishnah Three
If one says, “Behold, I am a nazirite,” and becomes impure on the thirtieth day, he renders void the whole period. 
Rabbi Eliezer says: only seven days are void. 
[If one says,] “Behold, I am a nazirite for thirty days”, and becomes impure on the thirtieth day, the he renders void the whole period.

Explanation
Section one:  According to the first opinion, even though he has reached the thirtieth day, and thereby completed his nazirite vow of unspecified duration, since he has not yet brought his sacrifices, his becoming impure renders the whole period void.  He now has to become pure, shave and bring sacrifices and then start counting again.
Rabbi Eliezer holds that this does not void all of the days which he has already served.  Rather he waits seven days, during which he purifies himself and then brings the end of naziriteship sacrifices.  According to Rabbi Eliezer, since on the thirtieth day he could have offered his sacrifices before he became impure, it is as if he completed his naziriteship, he just can’t offer his sacrifices until he becomes pure.
Section two:  However, if he vows to be a nazirite for thirty days, he must serve a full thirty days, as we learned in yesterday’s mishnah.  In this case if he becomes impure on the thirtieth day, Rabbi Eliezer would agree that he has rendered the entire naziriteship void.  He must become pure and then start counting again.
