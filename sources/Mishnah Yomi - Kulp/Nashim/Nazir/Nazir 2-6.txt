Nazir, Chapter Two, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah is a continuation of yesterday’s mishnah.  It deals with a situation in which a person vows that he will bring the offerings of half of a nazirite.

Mishnah Six
[If one says,] “I take it upon myself to bring the hair offering of half of another nazirite,”  and his friend heard and said, “I too take it upon myself to bring the hair offering of half of another nazirite,” –, this one brings a full hair offering and this one brings a full hair offering, the words of Rabbi Meir.
But the Sages say: each brings half a hair offering.

Explanation
The statement of these two people is strange and can be interpreted in two different ways.  When they each say, “I take it upon myself to bring the hair offering of half of another nazirite”, they may have thought that there was such a thing as a half-nazirite.  Since there is no such thing, Rabbi Meir says they both must bring a full hair-offering.   
In contrast, the Sages assume that what he meant to say was that he would bring half of the hair offering of a nazirite.  Therefore, each pays for half of the offerings that one nazirite must bring, and the nazirite himself would be responsible for the remainder.
