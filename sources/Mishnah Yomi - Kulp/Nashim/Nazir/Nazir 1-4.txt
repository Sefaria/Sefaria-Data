Nedarim, Chapter One, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah discusses a person who seemingly accepts upon himself an extremely large number of naziriteships.  The question is, is he considered a life-nazirite, or one who is observing an endless series of naziriteships, who must shave his head between each period. 

Mishnah Four
[If one says,] “Behold, I am a nazirite as the hairs of my head”, or “As the dust of the earth”, or “As the sands of the sea,” he becomes a life-nazirite, and shaves his head every thirty days. 
Rabbi says: this one does not shave his head every thirty days.  
The one who shave his head every thirty days is the one who says, “Behold, upon me are naziriteships as the hair on my head”, or “As the dust of the earth”, or “As the sands of the sea.”

Explanation
Section one:  According to the first opinion in this mishnah, this person has made an infinite number of nazirite vows, each one being without specified duration, and hence thirty days.  Therefore, he observes one naziriteship, shaves his head, offers sacrifices, and then immediately begins to observe another naziriteship.  According to Rabbi, this person’s intention was merely to be a life-nazirite. Therefore, he does not shave his head once every thirty days.
Section two:  This is a continuation of Rabbi’s words from the previous section.  In order for him to be in the category of one who shaves his head every thirty days, he must specify that he is vowing many naziriteships.  In this case he accepts upon himself distinct periods of naziriteship, shaving after each one is completed.
