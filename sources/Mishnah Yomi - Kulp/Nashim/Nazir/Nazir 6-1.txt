Nazir, Chapter Six, Mishnah One

Introduction
This mishnah first lists what is prohibited to a nazirite and then delineates the minimum amount of products that a nazirite must eat/drink to be considered liable.   

Mishnah One
Three things are forbidden to a nazirite:  ritual defilement, shaving, and products of the vine. 
All products of the vine join together [to add up to a minimum measure], and he is not liable until he eats an olive’s worth of grapes.
According to the earlier mishnah, until he drinks a quarter [of a log] of wine. 
Rabbi Akiba says: even if he soaked his bread in wine and it is enough to make an olive’s worth—he is liable.

Explanation
Section one:  This section provides an overview of what is forbidden to the nazirite.  Note that the prohibition of ritual defilement refers only to defilement contracted from dead bodies, and not other forms of defilement.
Section two:  As with most halakhot, the rabbis give a minimum measure beyond which a person has transgressed against the Torah.  According to our mishnah, a mishnah which can be attributed to Rabbi Akiba, as we shall see below, a person is liable once he has eaten an olive’s worth of grapes.  This olive’s worth can be composed of any grape products:  juices, skins and seeds.  
In contrast, according to the earlier mishnah, he is not obligated unless he drinks a quarter log of wine, an amount that is about an eighth of a liter (a little less than one-third of a soda can).  
Rabbi Akiba disagrees with the earlier mishnah and holds that the minimum measure is an olive’s worth, an amount smaller than a quarter of a log.  He also holds that if the wine is soaked up by something which is permitted to eat, then if together they add up to an olive’s worth, he is liable. So if the bread and wine together are an olive’s worth he is liable.
