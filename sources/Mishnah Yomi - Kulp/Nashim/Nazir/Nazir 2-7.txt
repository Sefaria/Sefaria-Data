Nazir, Chapter Two, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a person who stipulates that he will be a nazirite if he has a son, or, alternatively, if he has a child. The question is, what is the definition of a son or child. 
As an aside, we can see from this mishnah that people made nazirite vows as a way of thanking God for things God has given them.  The same is true for vows in general.

Mishnah Six
[If one says,] “Behold, I am a nazirite when I shall have a son,” and son is born to him, he becomes a nazirite. 
If the child is a daughter, or a tumtum, or an hermaphrodite, he does not become a nazirite. 
If he said, “When I shall have a child,” then even if it is a daughter, or a tumtum, or an hermaphrodite, he becomes a nazirite.

Explanation
Section one:  A “tumtum” is a person who has no signs of being male or female.  A hermaphrodite has both male and female genitalia.  The mishnah teaches that when the person said “when I shall have a son”, his intention was specifically for a son and not for any of the other three genders, female, the gender-less tumtum or double-gendered.  Note that the mishnah has to say this because sometimes the Hebrew word for son “ben” can mean “child.”   This is how the word is interpreted in Deuteronomy 25:5, in the context of the laws of levirate marriage.  
Section two:  However, if he says “child” any child is included, no matter the gender.
