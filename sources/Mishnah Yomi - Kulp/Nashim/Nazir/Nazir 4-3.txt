Nazir, Chapter Four, Mishnah Three

Introduction
A person who intentionally breaks their nazirite vow receives up to forty lashes, the same punishment received for breaking any negative commandment.  
This mishnah deals with a woman who broke her nazirite vow but did not know that her husband had already annulled it.

Mishnah Three
If a woman takes a nazirite vow and then drinks wine or is defiled by a corpse, she receives forty [lashes]. 
If her husband annuls [her vow] and she did not know that he annulled it, and she drinks wine or is defiled by a corpse, she does not receive the forty [lashes]. 
Rabbi Judah says: even though she does not receive the forty [lashes] she should receive lashes for disobedience. 

Explanation
Section one:  This section simply states that a woman who breaks her nazirite vow is punished by up to forty lashes, as is anyone who breaks a nazirite vow.  The Talmud explains that this is true even if her husband annuls the vow after she broke it.  Since she broke it while the vow was still valid, she has transgressed and is therefore punished.
Section two:  In this case, the husband annulled the vow before she broke it, but she did not know that he had annulled it.  When she drank wine or defiled herself (intentionally) she thought that she was breaking her vow.  The case is therefore one of a person who intended to sin but did not know that what they were actually doing was not sinful.  According to the first opinion she receives no punishment.  However, Rabbi Judah adds that although she is not punished with the regular lashes, she receives “lashes for disobedience”.  These are “derabbanan” lashes, which the court can hand out whenever it sees fit.  Since she intended to be sinful, she deserves to be punished, even though she did not actually break any vow.
