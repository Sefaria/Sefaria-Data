Nazir, Chapter Six, Mishnah Eleven

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a situation where a nazirite began to have his sacrifices offered and then during the process, he became impure through contact with a dead body.  The question is, when he becomes clean, does he have to bring again the sacrifice(s) which was already offered.    

Mishnah Eleven
If [a nazirite] on whose behalf one kind of blood has been sprinkled becomes unclean, 
Rabbi Eliezer says: everything is annulled.
But the Sages say: he should bring his remaining sacrifices after purification. 
They said to him: it happened that Miriam the Tadmorite had one kind of blood sprinkled on her behalf, and they came and told her that her daughter was dangerously ill. She went and found her dead and the sages told her to offer her remaining sacrifices after purification.

Explanation 
The topic of this mishnah is a nazirite who became impure after one of her sacrifices had been slaughtered and its blood sprinkled on the altar, but before the other sacrifices had undergone this process.  According to Rabbi Eliezer, her becoming impure annuls all of her sacrifices, even the one whose blood had already been spilled.  Therefore, she must wait seven days to become pure and then bring a new set of sacrifices.  
In contrast, the sages hold that the sacrifice whose blood had already been sprinkled counts and that after becoming pure, she need bring only the sacrifices that had not yet been offered.  The sages prove their point by bringing a story of where this actually happened.  â€¨As a side note, it is interesting that the two stories of nazirites which we have encountered, the story regarding Queen Helena and this one, involve women. While it may be imprudent to make any conclusions from such scanty evidence, perhaps taking nazirite vows was a form of religious expression common, at least relatively speaking, among women.
