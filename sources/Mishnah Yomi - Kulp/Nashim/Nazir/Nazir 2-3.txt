Nazir, Chapter Two, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a person who tries to become a nazirite in regard to one cup of wine alone, without being a total nazirite.
 
Mishnah Three
If they mixed for him a cup of wine, and he said, “Behold, I am a nazirite in regard to it,” he becomes a nazirite. 
It once happened that a woman was intoxicated and they mixed for her a cup of wine and she said, “Behold, I am a nazirite in regard to it.” 
The sages ruled that she only meant to forbid it to herself as a sacrifice.

Explanation
Section one:  This section rules that the person did not intend to become a nazirite just from the cup of wine served to him.  When he said “in regard to it” his intention may have been in regard to wine in general.  We will learn in tomorrow’s mishnah that one cannot be a partial nazirite, being prohibited from wine and not from shaving, for example.  Hence this person is a full nazirite.
Section two:  The fact that this woman was already intoxicated means that she did not intend to make all wine forbidden to her; she wanted only to forbid herself one more cup of wine.  Therefore the sages interpret her to have meant that the cup of wine offered to her should be prohibited like a sacrifice.
