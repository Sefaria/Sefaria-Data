Gittin, Chapter Seven, Mishnah One

Introduction
This mishnah is about a husband who is gripped by some sort of mental illness and hence may not be in his right mind when he decides to divorce his wife.  
The second section is about a mute husband’s ability to divorce his wife.

Mishnah One
If a man is gripped by the kordiakos illness and says, “Write a get for my wife”, he has not said anything. 
If he says, “Write a get for my wife”, and is then gripped by kordiakos and then says, “Do not write it”, his latter words are of no effect. 
If he becomes mute, and they say to him, “Should we write a get for your wife”, and he nods his head, he is tested three times.  
If he answers ‘no’ and ‘yes’ properly each time, then they should write the get.

Explanation
Section one:  “Kordiakos” is evidently some sort of mental illness.  If a husband is gripped by this illness, his instructions to others to divorce his wife do not have any legal validity.  Similarly, if a healthy person instructs others to divorce his wife, and then is gripped by “kordiakos” and then wishes to retract, his retraction is meaningless.  In short, the instructions of a mentally sick person do not have legal validity.
Section two:  A mute person is not considered someone who lacks “da’at”—awareness or intelligence.  Hence he can legally divorce his wife.  However, since he cannot speak, it is a slightly more difficult to ascertain whether he wants to divorce.  The mishnah rules that he may answer questions with head gestures.  Those asking the questions must be certain what these gestures mean and therefore they test him with other questions.  For instance, if his name is Reuven, they can say, “Is your name Reuven?”  If he nods, that means that nodding signifies an affirmative answer.  They would repeat this test three times.
