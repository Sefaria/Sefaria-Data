Gittin, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah returns to the subject taught in 6:7, that if a husband instructs people to write a get, they themselves must write the get.  They may have a scribe write the get only if he tells them that they may do so.   

Mishnah Two
They said to him, “Shall we write a get for your wife”, and he said to them, “Write!”, and they then told a scribe and he wrote and witnesses and they signed—even if they wrote it and signed it and gave it back to him and he gave it to her, the get is void until he himself says to the scribe “Write” and to the witnesses, “Sign”.

Explanation
In this mishnah’s scenario the husband told others to write a get for his wife.  The people whom he told then went and had a scribe write the get and other witnesses signed.  This invalidates the get since the husband did not tell them that others could write the get. Even if after the scribe writes it they give the get back to the husband and the husband gives it to the wife, thereby tacitly agreeing to what they had done, the get is still invalid.  Since he did not tell them beforehand that they could have a scribe write the get, his consent ex post facto cannot revalidate the get.
