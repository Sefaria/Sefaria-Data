Gittin, Chapter Three, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a person who becomes sick while delivering a get inside the land of Israel.  In tomorrow’s mishnah we shall deal with a person who becomes sick while bringing a get from abroad.  
 
Mishnah Five
If one bringing a get in the land of Israel becomes sick, he can send it with another. 
But if [the husband] said to him, “Take for me from her such-and-such an object”, he may not send it [the get] with another, since the husband may not want his deposit in the hand of another.

Explanation
Section one:  As we learned in chapter one, a person who delivers a get within the land of Israel need not state, “In my presence it was written and signed.”  Therefore, there is no problem with giving the get to another person, should the original person not be able to complete the delivery due to sickness.  
Section two:  In this case, the husband told his agent to do two things:  1) bring the get; 2) retrieve something from his wife.  While we can assume that the husband will not mind someone else delivering the get, he may not trust a different person to recover his belonging.  Therefore, the agent cannot even send the get with another person, since that other person cannot retrieve the object.
