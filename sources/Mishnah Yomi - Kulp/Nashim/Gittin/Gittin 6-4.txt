Gittin, Chapter Six, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a woman married to a priest.  As long as she is married she may eat terumah.  However, once she is divorced she loses this right.  The mishnah deals with such a woman who appoints an agent to receive or bring her get.

Mishnah Four
[If a woman says to an agent], “Bring me my get”, she may eat terumah until the get reaches her hand. 
[If she says,] “Receive for me my get”, she is forbidden to eat terumah immediately.   [If she says,] “Receive for me my get in such-and-such a place”, she can eat terumah until the get reaches that place. 
Rabbi Elazar says that she is forbidden immediately.

Explanation
Section one:  Since she appointed the agent to bring her the get, she is not divorced until she actually receives the get.  She may continue to eat terumah until this point.  
Section two: However, if she appoints an agent to receive the get, she must cease eating terumah immediately.  Since the agent might receive the get on her behalf at any moment, we must be concerned lest she is divorced immediately and hence she immediately loses her right to eat terumah.
Section three:   If she tells the agent to receive the get in a certain place, then according to the first opinion she is not divorced unless the agent receives the get at that place.  Hence she may estimate how long it will take the agent to arrive at that place and she may continue to eat terumah until that point.  
However, Rabbi Elazar disagrees. Since, as we learned yesterday, he holds that the agent can validly receive the get anywhere, she can be divorced immediately.  Hence he holds that also in this situation she must cease eating terumah immediately.
