Gittin, Chapter One, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with which messengers must recite the formula “In my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed.”  

Mishnah Three
One who brings a get within the land of Israel need not declare, “In my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed.”   
If there are those who protest [its validity] it must be established through the signatures. 
If one who brings a get from abroad is not able to declare “In my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed”, if there are witnesses on it, its validity can be established through its signatures.

Explanation
Section one:  A messenger who brings a get from one place within the land of Israel to another place need not say the formula “In my presence” etc.  The formula is only mandatory for cases where it will be difficult to locate witnesses to validate the get. Within the borders of the land of Israel this will not be difficult. Furthermore, it was only people outside of the land who did not know how to write and sign gittin, and therefore the messenger had to testify to its validity.  Within the land there was no such concern. If someone should come and protest the get, saying that it is false, the court could summons the witnesses.
Section two:  This section discusses a messenger who did not see the get written and signed, and therefore cannot state, “In my presence…” In such a case, the default procedure is to validate the get through the witnesses who have signed on it.  In this case the woman receiving the get cannot remarry until its validity has been proven.  In contrast, in the above case, if the get is brought within Israel, she may remarry without validating the get. She only needs to validate if others protest its validity.
