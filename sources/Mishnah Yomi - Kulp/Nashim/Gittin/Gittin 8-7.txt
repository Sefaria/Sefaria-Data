Gittin, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah is quite similar to yesterday’s mishnah.  Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven 
If a man marries his sister-in-law and her rival wife goes and marries another man and it was found that the first is an aylonit, the other must leave both husbands and all these consequences apply to her. 

Explanation
In today’s mishnah Reuven was married to two women, Rachel and Leah.  When Reuven dies, Rachel marries Shimon, Reuven’s brother, thereby fulfilling the mitzvah of yibbum.  Leah is free to marry an outsider, so she marries David.  When it turns out that Rachel is an aylonit, her yibbum marriage to Shimon is invalidated.  Leah has therefore married an outsider without halitzah, which according to our mishnah (but not the accepted halakhah), renders her marriage invalid and her child with her new husband a mamzer.  She may not remain married to her husband, nor have yibbum with Shimon, and all of the consequences listed in mishnah five apply to her.
