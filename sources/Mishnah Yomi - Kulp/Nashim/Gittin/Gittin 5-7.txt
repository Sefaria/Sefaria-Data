Gittin, Chapter Five, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah has to do with transactions done by two categories of people considered to legally lack “da’at”, intelligence—minors and deaf-mutes.  As we see from this mishnah, the rabbis seem well aware that well deaf-mutes had great difficulties communicating, they nevertheless could make their wishes known.  

Mishnah Seven
A deaf-mute can gesture and be gestured at [and thereby conduct transactions].  
Ben Betera says that he may make lip-motions, if the transaction is of movable property.
The purchase or sale done by young children in movable property is valid.

Explanation
Section one:  If a deaf-mute wishes to sell or purchase an object he may do so by gesturing or by being gestured at.  People who can speak must verbalize their commands.  Since this is impossible for a deaf-mute, gestures are sufficient.
Ben Betera is more lenient and even allows even lip-motions, as long as the transaction is only with movable property, i.e. not land.  To buy or sell land he would need to make a full gesture.
Section two:  Young children can sell or purchase movable property.  The Talmud explains that this is a form of “tikkun olam”.  If children could not sell or buy things they would not be able to earn their keep, and until modern times children had to work to help support their families (in good situations) or support themselves (in much worse situations).
