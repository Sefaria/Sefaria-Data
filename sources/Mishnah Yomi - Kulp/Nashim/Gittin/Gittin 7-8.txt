Gittin, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
In today’s mishnah, a husband conditions his get upon is return home within twelve months.  The mishnah discusses the validity of the get should he die within that time.

Mishnah Eight 
[If a husband says,] “This is your get if I do not return within twelve months”, and he dies within twelve months, it is not a get.   
[If he says,] “This is your get from now if I do not return within twelve months”, and he dies within twelve months, it is a get.

Explanation
As we learned in mishnah three, there can be no divorce after death.  In the first section, the wife is a widow because the get could not become valid until after twelve months.  At the point when the get could become valid, the husband was already dead.  In contrast, in the second section the husband says “From now…”, meaning that the get will become retroactively valid to the point at which it was given.  When he fails to return after twelve months, she is considered a divorcee and not a widow. An interesting question asked, but not solved, in the Talmud, is whether or not she may remarry after he dies but before the twelve months are up.  On the one hand, in the future she will be considered a divorcee at the point of the giving of the get.  On the other hand, she has still not reached that point. [This is sort of a mishnaic time warp, and I love time warp scenarios].
