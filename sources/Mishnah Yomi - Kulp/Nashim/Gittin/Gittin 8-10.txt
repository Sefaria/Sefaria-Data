Gittin, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
At the end of yesterday’s mishnah we learned that a woman who was divorced with a “bald get” is not divorced.  Our mishnah explains what a “bald get” is and how it can be fixed.

Mishnah Nine
A “bald” get—anyone can complete its signatures, the words of Ben Nannas.
But Rabbi Akiva says that it may be completed only by relatives who are qualified to testify elsewhere.  
What is a “bald” get? One which has more folds than signatures.  

Explanation
It would be helpful to explain this mishnah backwards.  The end of the mishnah clarifies that a “bald get” is one which has more folds than signatures.  As I explained yesterday, some documents were folded and sewn on the folds to prevent forgeries.  One person would sign on each fold, and there could be many folds.  If there are any folds without signatures, then the document/get is invalid.  
However, in order to validate this get, it need not have perfectly acceptable witnesses sign. According to Ben Nannas, if at least two valid witnesses have already signed all that is needed is an additional signature for each fold and, that signature may be from a person who normally disqualified from testifying.  This would include relatives and gamblers.  Rabbi Akiva restricts the leniency to relatives who would otherwise be allowed to testify, but would not normally be allowed to in this case.   Gamblers and others who are always invalid could not complete the “bald get.”
