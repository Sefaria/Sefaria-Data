Gittin, Chapter Three, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Today’s mishnah discusses a person who is delivering a get from abroad and cannot complete his delivery.

Mishnah Six 
If one bringing a get from abroad becomes sick, he may arrange a court of law and send him [on with the get,] declaring before them, “In my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed.” 
And the last agent is not required to say, “In my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed”, rather he declares, “I am the messenger of a court.”

Explanation
Section one:  Generally, the person who was charged to bring the get should bring it himself.  If he cannot because he becomes sick on the way, he cannot merely give it to another messenger because the husband did not give him permission to do so.  In order to deliver the get to the wife, he will need to set up a court of law consisting of three judges and make his declaration in front of them.  The court may then, on the husband’s behalf, appoint an agent to deliver the get.
Section two:  The agent sent from the court obviously cannot say, “In my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed”, which the person delivering the get usually needs to say, because that would not be true. Upon delivering the get, what he can say is “I am the messenger of the court.”  We can trust that the court would not have sent him had the get not been executed properly. As an aside, by calling him “the last agent” the mishnah alludes to the fact that this may not be the original agent sent by the court.  The passing of the get from one agent to the other may happen many times.
