Nedarim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a person who vows not to eat food which goes into a pot.  The mishnah relates to two such types of food; 1)  food that is totally boiled in the pot; 2)  food that is lightly cooked in a pot and is finished cooking somewhere else, such as in a frying pan or in an oven.

Mishnah Two
He who vows abstinence from food prepared in a pot, is forbidden only from food boiled in a pot; 
But if he says, “Konam that I taste whatever goes down into a pot”, he is forbidden everything prepared in a pot. 

Explanation
Section one:  If a person takes a vow forbidding himself from eating anything “prepared in a pot” he is only forbidden from eating things totally prepared in the pot, meaning that they were completely boiled in the pot.  An example would be a grain dish, which in Talmudic times was boiled in water.  He would still be permitted to eat things which had preliminary stages of their cooking in a pot and were later baked or fried.
Section two:  However, if he says “whatever goes down into a pot”, he is forbidden to eat anything that has at any time been in a pot.
