Nedarim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah provides a general rule for determining when time bound vows end.

Mishnah Three
[If he vows,] “Until the grain harvest, “Until the grape harvest”, or, “Until the olive harvest,” he is forbidden only until it arrives. 
This is a general rule: Whatever has a fixed time and one vows, “Until it arrives,” he is forbidden until it arrives; if he says, “Until it be”, he is forbidden until it is over. 
But whatever has no fixed time, whether he says, “Until it be,” or “Until it arrives,” he is forbidden only until it arrives. 

Explanation
Section one:  As we shall learn in the second half of this mishnah, since harvests do not have set times, no matter how he vows, he will only be prohibited until the beginning of the harvest.
Section two:  The first half of this rule matches what we learned in yesterday’s mishnah.  Since Pesach has a set time, if he said “Until it be” he is forbidden until Pesach is over.  
The second half of the rule matches what we learned in the above section.  Since harvests have no set time, he is permitted as soon as the harvest begins, no matter how he vowed.
