Nedarim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Our mishnah teaches that sometimes, when a person prohibits a certain fruit to himself, he may not have that which grows from the fruit or that which is exchanged for the fruit.  However, on other occasions only the actual fruit itself is prohibited.

Mishnah Six
[If one says] “Konam be these fruits to me”, “Konam they are for my mouth,” or “Konam they are to my mouth,” he is forbidden [to benefit] from what is exchanged for them or what grows from them. 
[If one says “Konam] if I eat or taste of them,” he is permitted [to benefit] from what is exchanged for them or what grows of them, if it is a thing of which the seed itself perishes, but if the seed does not perish, even that which grows out of that which [first] grew from it is forbidden.

Explanation
Section one:  The three languages used in this section prohibit the one who vowed to receive any benefit from the fruit.  This would include anything exchanged for that fruit or anything that grows from the fruit.  
Section two:  However, if he says  “Konam if I eat or taste of these fruits”, he has only caused a prohibition on these fruits themselves.  He has not created a blanket prohibition of receiving benefit from the fruits. Therefore, he may eat things that are exchanged for these fruits and he may eat things that grow from the seeds of the fruit.
However, sometimes there is still a prohibition on deriving benefit from that which grows from the fruit.  In order for what grows from the fruit to be permitted, the original seed must cease to exist.  For instance, if one were to say “Konam if I eat this apple,” he may use the seed to grow a tree and eat the apples from the tree.  However, if the seed doesn’t cease to exist, such as an onion (which they considered to be like a seed) he may not eat what grows from it, because the originally prohibited object still exists.
