Nedarim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Three

Introduction
After having discussed at length vows of abstinence from food, the mishnah now discusses vows of abstinence from garments.  

Mishnah Three
He who vows not to wear garments is permitted sack-cloth, curtain, and blanket wrapping. 
If he says, “Konam, if wool comes upon me,” he may cover himself with wool shearings;   
[Konam] if flax comes upon me”, he may cover himself with stalks of flax.   
Rabbi Judah says: It all depends upon the person who vows, [thus:] if he was bearing a burden [with wool or flax] and perspires and had bad odor, and he said “Konam if wool or flax come upon me,” he may wear them, but not throw them [as a bundle] over his back.  

Explanation
Section one: Sack-cloth, curtain and blanket-wrapping are not considered “garments”.  Therefore, if one vows not to wear “garments”, he may still cover himself with these rough cloths.  
Section two:  In this section we learn that if a person vows not to cover himself with a finished type of material, he may still wear the unfinished product.  Thus, if he vows not to wear wool, he may still wear unprocessed wool shearings.  If he vows not to wear flax (linen), he may still cover himself with unprocessed stalks of flax.  
Section three:  Rabbi Judah states a general rule applicable to the interpretation of vows; the situation in which the person vowed must be taken into account.  Normally, when one vows that wool or flax should not come upon him, he means that he shall not wear them.  However, if a person was carrying a heavy bundle of flax or wool, and sweating and emitting a foul odor because of his intense perspiration, and then said, “Konam, if wool or flax come upon me”, his intention was that he should not carry them.  In such a situation, he may still wear them, but not throw them behind his back as a bundle.
