Nedarim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
In this mishnah a husband make’s a vow that if his wife goes to her father’s house before a certain time, she shall not be able to benefit from him for a defined period of time.

Mishnah Nine
[If he says, “Konam] be any benefit you have from me until Pesach, if you go to your father’s house until the festival [of Sukkot],” if she goes before Pesach she may not benefit from him until Pesach; if she goes after Pesach she is subject to, “he shall not break his word” (Numbers 30:3).  
[If he says, “Konam] be any benefit you have from me until the festival [of Sukkot] if you go to your father’s house before Pesach”, if she goes before Pesach, she may not benefit from him until the festival [of Sukkot], but she is permitted to go after Pesach.

Explanation
Section one:  The husband says to his wife after Sukkot that if she goes to her father’s house before the following Sukkot, she shall be forbidden to have any benefit from his (the husband's) things until Pesach.  If she goes before Pesach to visit her father, she may not benefit from her husband until after Pesach.  After Pesach the prohibitive vow has passed and she may derive benefit from his things. 
However, there is a problem if she goes to his house after Pesach for the time of prohibition created by the vow has already passed.  Therefore the mishnah teaches that if she did benefit from him before Pesach, she should not go to her father’s house after Pesach.  If she does go, she shall have broken the vow.   
Section two:  If he vows that if she goes to her father’s house before Pesach, she shall not have any benefit from him until Sukkot, if she goes before Pesach she may not benefit from him until Sukkot. However, after Pesach it is permitted for her to go to her father’s house, for he vowed only that she shouldn’t go until Pesach.
