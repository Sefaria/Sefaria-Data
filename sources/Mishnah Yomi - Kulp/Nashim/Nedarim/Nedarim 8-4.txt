Nedarim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Four

Introduction
The first section of the mishnah deals with a person who vows not to eat something until summer, which here is defined as referring to the summer harvest of figs, begins or ends.  The second section teaches about someone who sets his vow to end at the beginning of the grain harvest.

Mishnah Four
[If he says,] “Until the summer,”  or, “Until the summer shall be,” [he is forbidden] until people begin to bring [the figs] home in baskets.
“Until the summer [harvest] is past,” [he is forbidden] until the knives are folded up [and put away].  
[If he vows,] “Until the harvest,” [he is forbidden] until the people begin reaping the wheat harvest, but not the barley harvest.   
It all depends on the place where he vowed:  if in hill-country, the hill-country [harvest]; if in the valley, the valley harvest.

Explanation
Section one:  The summer is the time of the harvest of figs.  Since this is not a fixed time, it matters not whether he says “Until” or “Until it shall be”.  In either case, the summer harvest is considered to begin when people begin to bring in figs in baskets.  Merely bringing in a few loose figs would not be sufficient to consider the harvest as having begun.  The harvest is considered over when the knives used to cut the figs, have been folded up and put away for the next season.  
Section two:  If one vows not to eat something “Until the harvest”, he is assumed to be referring to the wheat harvest, which is “the” harvest, and not the barley harvest.  Had he wished to refer to the barley harvest, he would have had to specify so.
Section three:  The wheat harvest arrives at different times in different zones.  Therefore, the beginning or end of his vow will depend upon the times of harvest typical in the zone in which he vows.  If he was in the hill-country, the vow follows the harvest of the hill-country; if in the valley, it follows the harvest of the valley.
