Nedarim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Five

Introduction
If a husband makes a vow that he shall not benefit from his wife he must divorce her and pay her ketubah. Our mishnah teaches that his vow may be released by reference to her ketubah.    

Mishnah Five
They release a vow by reference to a wife’s kethubah. 
And it once happened that a man vowed not to benefit from his wife and her ketubah amounted to four hundred denarii.   
He went before Rabbi Akiva, who ordered him to pay her the ketubah [in full]. 
He said to him, “Rabbi!  My father left eight hundred denarii, of which my brother took four hundred and I took four hundred. Isn’t it enough that she should receive two hundred and I two hundred?” 
Rabbi Akiva replied: even if you have to sell the hair of your head you must pay her her ketubah. 
He said to him, “Had I known that it is so, I would not have vowed.” 
And Rabbi Akiva released his vow.  

Explanation
In this story the man must divorce his wife because he vowed not to receive benefit from her.  There is no way that he can remain married without receiving some benefit from her because he is obligated to have sexual relations with her and would at that time receive benefit.  However, when he divorces her he doesn’t want to pay her large ketubah.  He goes in front of Rabbi Akiva to try to receive an exemption but Rabbi Akiva tells him he must pay the ketubah in full.  He then complains that if he pays her entire ketubah he will be left with no inheritance. Rabbi Akiva, using illustrative language, tells him that even if he has to sell the hair on his head (assumedly he was not bald, or Rabbi Akiva was speaking tongue in cheek) he must pay her ketubah in full.  The husband’s statement “Had I known that it is so, I would not have vowed” shows his regret and is therefore accepted as grounds for releasing the vow.
