Nedarim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Employing the example of dates and date honey, and winter grapes and winter grape vinegar, the mishnah discusses food derivatives that still partially retain the name of the foods from which they derive.  An example today might be apples and apple juice.  This differs from wine and oil (in the mishnah “oil” always refers to olive oil), which are not called “grape wine” or “olive oil”.

Mishnah Eight
He who vows abstinence from dates is permitted date honey; from winter grapes, is permitted winter-grape vinegar.
Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra said: if it bears the name of its origin, and he vows to abstain from it,  he is forbidden [to benefit] from what comes from it. 
But the Sages permit it.

Explanation
Section one:  According to the sages, whose opinion is expressed here and at the end of the mishnah, although “date honey” and “winter grape vinegar” are called by the same name as “dates” and “winter grapes”, they are permitted to one who vowed to abstain from dates or winter grapes.  [Winter grapes are a type of grape that ripens in late fall and are only used for making vinegar.]  We assume that when he prohibited dates or winter grapes to himself, his intention was the dates or winter grapes themselves, and not anything that derives from them.
Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra says that since they still retain the name of dates or winter-grapes, they are forbidden.  This would be true in any case of a food which retains the name of the food from which it derives.
