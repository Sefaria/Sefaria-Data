Nedarim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah continues to discuss a husband who forbids that which his wife produces.  In the case in our mishnah he sets a time limit for the prohibition.   

Mishnah Eight
[If he says to his wife, “Konam that] what you will produce I will not eat from it until Pesach” or “That what you will produce, I will not wear until Pesach”, he may eat or wear after Pesach that which she produces before Pesach. 
[If he says to his wife “Konam that] what you produce until Pesach I will not eat”, or “That what you produce until Pesach I will not wear”, what she produces before Pesach he may not eat after Pesach.

Explanation
Section one:  In this section he vows not to eat of what she produces or wear things that she makes until Pesach.  However, once Pesach passes he may eat anything she produced and wear anything she made, even before Pesach.  The prohibition was on a time period and not on things made within that time period.
Section two:  In this case the prohibition was on anything made between the time of the vow and Pesach.  In other words, the prohibition was not on the time period but on the objects themselves.  Therefore, these things remain prohibited even after Pesach.
