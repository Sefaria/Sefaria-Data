Nedarim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah continues to illustrate the principle that a vow that has been partially released is fully released.  

Mishnah Eight
“Konam is the one that I taste, because wine is damaging to the stomach.”
They said to him, “But mature wine is beneficial to the stomach.”
He is released in respect of mature wine, and not only in respect of mature wine, but of all wine. 
“Konam the onions that I taste, because they are damaging to the heart.” 
They said to him, “But village onions are good for the heart,” 
He is released in respect of village onions, and not only of village onions, but of all onions. 
Such a case happened before Rabbi Meir, and he permitted all onions. 

Explanation
Section one:  When the person vowed not to have wine, he stated that he is doing so because he believes that wine is bad for one’s stomach.  People then pointed out to him that not all wine is bad for the stomach.  Mature wine (aged at least three years) is not damaging for the stomach. [By the way, I don’t know if this is considered true today, so be on guard!] He then responded, “Had I known that mature wine is beneficial for the stomach, I would not have vowed.”  The regret is sufficient to allow him to drink mature wine, and since the vow has been partially released, it is completely released.  
Section two:  This section basically teaches the same principle learned in the previous section.  In addition, the mishnah relates that Rabbi Meir, a student of Rabbi Akiva’s, actually ruled this way in a case that came before him.  We should note that in the eyes of the mishnah precedents are of extreme importance.
