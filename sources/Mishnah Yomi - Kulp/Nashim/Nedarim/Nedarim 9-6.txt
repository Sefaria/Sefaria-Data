Nedarim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Six

Introduction
The specific topic of this mishnah is releasing a vow that a person made to fast on a day on which it is forbidden to fast.  However, the second part of the mishnah discusses a rule of larger consequence:  the overall validity of a vow when part of the vow has been released.  The following two mishnayoth will continue to deal with this subject.

Mishnah Six
They release vows by reference to the sabbaths and festivals. 
The earlier ruling was that for these days the vow is cancelled, but for others it is binding, until Rabbi Akiva came and taught: a vow which is partially released is entirely released.

Explanation
Section one:  If a person made a vow to fast on a day upon which it is forbidden to fast, for instance the Sabbath or one of the festivals, a sage may say to him, “If you had known that it was forbidden to fast on the Sabbath or on the festivals would you have still made your vow?”  If he expresses regret the vow is released.
Section two:  Originally, the rule was that the vow was released for the sabbath or festival days but if the vow to fast was for a longer period of time, then the vow retained its validity on the other days.  Thus it would be forbidden for him to fast on the sabbath, but he would be obligated to fast the day before and the day after (depending on the length of his vow).  This ruling was changed by Rabbi Akiva who said that a vow that had been partly released is entirely released.  
Note that we learned a similar principle above in 3:2. There we learned that if a vow is partially invalid, according to Beth Hillel it is entirely invalid.  The principle of Rabbi Akiva in our mishnah continues from that Hillelian position.  Rabbi Akiva says that just as a vow that was partially invalid from its inception is totally invalid, so too a vow that was later partially invalidated is completely invalidated.
