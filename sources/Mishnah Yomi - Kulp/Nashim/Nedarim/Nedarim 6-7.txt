Nedarim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah continues to illustrate the principle learned in yesterday’s mishnah.  If one vows abstinence from a type of food, he may not eat anything which is called by that name.  However, he may eat derivatives of the food as long as they are called by a different name.  But, if one vows abstinence from a specific piece of food, i.e. “this piece of meat” or “this wine” he is forbidden to eat not only that piece of food but anything that has derived taste from it.
The mishnah discusses wine, grapes, olives and olive oil.

Mishnah Seven
He who vows [abstinence] from wine, may eat food which contains the taste of wine. 
If he says, “Konam if I taste this wine”, and it falls into food, if it is sufficient to impart its taste [to the food] it is forbidden.
He who vows [abstinence] from grapes is permitted wine; from olives, is permitted oil. 
If he says, “Konam if I taste these olives and grapes”, he is forbidden to eat them and [the liquids] that come out of them.

Explanation
Section one:  If he vows to abstain from wine, he may still eat food that has wine in it, because it is not called “wine”.  However, if he vows to abstain from “this wine” he may not eat anything which has received some taste from that specific wine.
Section two:  Although grapes are generally made into wine and olives into olive oil, one who vows not to eat grapes or olives may still drink wine and use olive oil.  However, if he forbids specific grapes or olives, he may not eat anything to which they impart their taste.  Obviously, this would include wine made from the grapes or oil made from the olives.
