Nedarim, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Eleven

Introduction
Our mishnah returns to discuss the category of vows made between the couple (“between him and her”) the type of vow that in general the husband has a right to annul. 

Mishnah Eleven
[If she vows,] “Konam the benefit that I derive from my father or from your father if I make anything for you,”  
Or, “Konam the benefit that I derive from you, if I make anything for my father or your father,” he can annul.

Explanation
Section one:  In the first case the wife says that she will not benefit from her or her husband’s father if she makes anything for her husband.  Seemingly this is not the type of vow that the husband could annul because she could make something for him and then not benefit from her father or his father.  This should not be considered a vow “between him and her”, the only type of vow that the husband can break.
Section two:  Similarly this too is should not be a vow that the husband could annul because she could just refrain from making anything for her or her husband’s father.  This also should not be considered a vow “between him and her.”
Despite this, the mishnah rules that the husband may annul the vows.  This is because the husband does not want work that his wife does for him to come between her and her father or his father.  It is also disgraceful for him that she should not be allowed to do anything for her father or his father, lest she not be able to make anything for him.  Therefore, in both cases he has the right to annul.
