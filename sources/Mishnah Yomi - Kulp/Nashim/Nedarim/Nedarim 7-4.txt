Nedarim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah discusses one who vows not to use a house or the upper story of a house.

Mishnah Four
One who vows not to benefit from a house is permitted the upper story, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
But the Sages say: the upper story is included in “house”. 
He who vows not to benefit from the upper story is permitted the use of the house.

Explanation
According to Rabbi Meir, when a person vows not to benefit from a “house” he may still make use of the upper story in that house.  The Sages disagree and hold that the upper story is included in the house and therefore, one who vows not to use the house may also not use the upper story.  However, one who vows not to use the upper story, may according to all opinions, still use the house.  This is because the upper story is a specific part of the house, and hence one who vowed not to use it, certainly did not intend to prohibit upon himself the entire house.
