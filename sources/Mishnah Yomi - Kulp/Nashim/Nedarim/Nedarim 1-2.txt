Nedarim, Chapter One, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah continues to discuss the various substitutes for vows. All of the cases here are words that sound like the normal word used for taking a vow, or a typical substitute.  
Interestingly, there is a debate in the Talmud over the source of these substitutes.  R. Yochanan says that their source is the language of the Gentiles and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says that the Sages invented them so that people would not actually say the real word.  

Mishnah Two
One who says, “konam” “qonah” or “qonas”: these are the substitutes for korban.   
“Herek” “herech” or “heref,” these are substitutes for herem.   
“Nazik” “naziah” “paziah” these are substitutes for nazirite vows.
“Shevuthah” “shekukah” or one who vows with the word “mota” these are substitutes for shevuah (an oath).

Explanation
Section one:  The normal substitute for “korban”, a sacrifice is “konam”.  Our mishnah lists substitutes for “konam”.  All are valid as vows.
Section two:  All of these are words that have just been slightly changed from the real word “herem” which we already saw in yesterday’s mishnah.
Section three:  All of these are slight modifications of the word “nazir”, the Hebrew for nazirite.
Section four:  The first two are slight modifications of “shevuah”, an oath.  “Mota” is a modification of the Aramaic word, “momta”, which means oath.  
In all of these cases the substitution is effective.
