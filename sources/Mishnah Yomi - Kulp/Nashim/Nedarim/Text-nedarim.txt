At first it was ruled that three women must be divorced and receive their kethubah:  She who declares: i am defiled tO you”;  Or “Heaven is between you and me”;  And “May i be removed from jews.”  But subsequently, to prevent her from conceiving a passion for another  To the injury of her husband,  The ruling was amended thus: she who declared, “I am defiled unto you,” MUst bring proof: “Heaven is between me and you” — They should engage in prayer,   And “May i be removed from jews” — He [the husband] must annul his portion,   And she shall minister to him, whilst remaining removed from jews.
