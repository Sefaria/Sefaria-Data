Nedarim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Yesterday’s mishnah defined “vegetables”.  Today’s mishnah defines two other terms:  “produce” (tevuah) and “grain” (dagan).  Note that the Hebrew words are not exactly equivalent to their English translations.

Mishnah Two
He who vows abstinence from grain is forbidden dry Egyptian beans, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
But the Sages say: only the five species of grain are forbidden him.  
Rabbi Meir says: He who vows abstinence from produce (tevuah) is forbidden only the five species; but one who vows abstinence from grain (dagan), is forbidden all; yet he is permitted the fruits of the tree and vegetables.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Rabbi Meir “grain” includes dry Egyptian beans, which we learned yesterday were not included under the category of “vegetables”.  The Sages disagree and say that “grain” refers only to one of the five species:  wheat, barley, spelt, rye and oats.  
Section two:  Whereas the Sages held that “grain” refers to the five species, Rabbi Meir holds that “produce” refers to the five species.  Under the category of “grain” Rabbi Meir includes other things besides the five species, including pulse, as we learned in section one.  The only thing not included in “produce” are fruits and vegetables.
