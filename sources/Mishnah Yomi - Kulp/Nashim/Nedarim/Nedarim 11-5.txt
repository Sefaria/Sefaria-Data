Nedarim, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Our mishnah teaches that if a husband/father annuls a vow of his wife/daughter but is mistaken with regard to who vowed, what type of vow they took or what was being prohibited, he must annul the vow again in order for it to be annulled.  

Mishnah Five
If his wife vowed, and he thought that his daughter had vowed, or if his daughter vowed and he thought that his wife had vowed; 
If she took the vow of a nazirite, and he thought that she had vowed by a korban, or if she vowed by a korban, and he thought that she vowed a nazirite vow; 
If she vowed [to abstain] from figs, and he thought that she vowed [to abstain] from grapes, or if she vowed [to abstain] from grapes and he thought that she vowed from figs, he must annul [the vow] again.

Explanation
Section one:  In this case the husband/father was mistaken with regard to who vowed.
Section two:  In this case the mistake was with regard to the type of prohibition.  For instance, she vowed by a nazirite vow but her husband/father thought that the vow was a vow using a korban to prohibit wine (i.e. “wine is a korban to me”), or vice versa.  Although in both cases she would be forbidden to have wine, the husband still annulled the wrong type of vow.
Section three:  In this case the husband was mistaken with regard to what was being prohibited, figs or grapes.  
In all three cases, since the husband did not have full grasp of who was vowing, what type of vow they were taking, or what they were prohibiting, he must annul the vow again.  If he does not, the vow is valid.
