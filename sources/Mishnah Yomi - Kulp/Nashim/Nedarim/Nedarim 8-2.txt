Nedarim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our mishnah discusses various ways one might phrase a vow when one’s intent is for the vow to be completed by or perhaps right after Pesach.  The question asked is, does the language which the one who vowed used mean that the prohibition should include the seven days of the holiday or not?

Mishnah Two
[If one vows,] “Until Pesach,” he is forbidden until it arrives; 
“Until it is [Pesach],” he is forbidden until it is completed.   
“Until before Pesach,”:  Rabbi Meir says: he is forbidden until it arrives; Rabbi Yose says: he is forbidden until it is completed.

Explanation 
Section one:  If he says “Until Pesach” his intention is that the vow should last until Pesach begins.  “Until” in the everyday speech of people means “until” but not including.
Section two:  However, “Until it is Pesach” would include the entire holiday, because the entire holiday is still Pesach.  Therefore, the vow lasts until Pesach is completed.
Section three:  There is a debate between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yose over the meaning of the phrase “Until before Pesach.”  According to the former, this means before it arrives, whereas according to the latter this means until before the last hour of Pesach.
