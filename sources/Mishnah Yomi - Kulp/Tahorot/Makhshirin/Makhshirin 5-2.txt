Makhshirin, Chapter Five, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
One who swam in water, the water that splashed out does not come under the law of ‘if water be put’; 
But if it was his intention to splash his friend, this comes under the law of ‘if water be put’. 
If one made a ‘bird’ in the water, neither [the water] that splashed out nor what remained in it comes under the law of ‘if water be put’. 

Explanation
Section one: Since the person did not intend to splash water, the water that is splashed out does not cause susceptibility. However, if he intends to splash the water on his friend, it does cause susceptibility.
Section two: A "bird" is according to Albeck some kind of floating toy. In this case, he didn't want water to splash out nor did he want water to get into his toy. So this water does not cause susceptibility. The water on the outside of the bird will cause susceptibility because he wanted the bird-toy to get wet.
