Makhshirin, Chapter Five, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
The water that comes up into a ship or into the bilge or on the oars does not come   under the law of ‘if water be put’. 
The water that comes up in snares, nets, or in fishing nets does not come under the law of ‘if water be put’; 
But if he shook them out it does come   under the law of ‘if water be put’. 
One who leads a ship out into the Great Sea in order to forge its bolts, or one who a nail  out into the rain in order to forge it, or one who puts a brand out in the rain in order to extinguish it, this comes under the law of ‘if water be put’. 

Explanation
Sections one and two: In all of these cases, the water that comes up onto various parts of the boat or its accoutrements does not cause susceptibility. However, if he shakes them out to get the water out, the water does cause susceptibility because he wanted to move it.
Section three: In these cases someone put something into the water in order to achieve some goal: to forge the metal, to strengthen the wood of the boat, or to cool off a brand. Since in all of these cases he wanted it the item to get wet, the water does cause susceptibility. 
The Great Sea refers to the Mediterranean.
