Makhshirin, Chapter Two, Mishnah One

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with sweatâ€”when does it cause something to be susceptible to uncleanness and when does it not. 

Mishnah One
The sweat of houses, of cisterns, of ditches and caverns does not cause  susceptibility to uncleanness. 
A man's perspiration does not cause susceptibility to uncleanness. 
If a man drank unclean water and perspired, his perspiration does not cause susceptibility to uncleanness. 
If he entered into drawn water and perspired, his perspiration causes susceptibility to uncleanness. 
If he dried himself and then perspired, his perspiration does not cause susceptibility to uncleanness. 

Explanation
Section one: Sweat from buildings and other structures, meaning the moisture formed on their outsides, has not been moved by a person and therefore it does not cause susceptibility to impurity.
Section two: Human perspiration similarly does not cause susceptibility.
Section three: The sweat that comes out of his body is not accorded the same status as the unclean water from which it comes, because he already ingested it. It counts as sweat and therefore it does not cause susceptibility.
Section four: In this case, since he didn't ingest the water but rather bathed in it, his sweat is considered as if it came from the drawn water. Therefore, it causes susceptibility.
Section five: If he then dries himself, he has gotten rid of the water from the drawn water and his sweat is considered to be from his body. Therefore, it no longer causes susceptibility.
