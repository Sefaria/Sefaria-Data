Makhshirin, Chapter Five, Mishnah Eleven

Mishnah Eleven
If a woman whose hands were clean stirred an unclean pot and her hands perspired, they become unclean.   
If her hands were unclean and she stirred a clean pot and her hands perspired the pot becomes unclean.   
Rabbi Yose says: only if her hands dripped.   
One who weighs grapes with a balance, the wine in the scale is clean until it is poured into a vessel.   
Behold, this is like baskets of olives and grapes when they are dripping [with sap].

Explanation
Section one: We can assume that the liquid on the woman's wet and sweaty hands comes from the liquid in the pot and therefore her hands are unclean.
Section two: In this case, since her hands sweated due to the heat of the pot, we look at the hot liquid in the pot as if it was connected to the liquid in her hands. Just as the liquid on her hands is unclean, so too the liquid in the pot has become unclean.
Rabbi Yose disagrees and doesn't consider the liquid in the pot to be connected to her hands. The liquid in the pot is impure only if the liquid from her hands drops back into the pot.
Section three: A person weighs grapes by putting them into a basket on a balance. Some liquid, called here wine although it is not yet wine, drips out into the basket. This liquid is clean and does not cause susceptibility to impurity until it is poured into a vessel. This is because he doesn't want the liquids to come out while the grapes are still being weighed, just as he doesn't want the liquids to come out of olives or grapes while they are still in the basket (we will return to this subject in 6:8).
