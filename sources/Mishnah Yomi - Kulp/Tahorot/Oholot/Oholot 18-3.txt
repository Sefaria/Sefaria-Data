Ohalot, Chapter Eighteen, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
A field in which a grave has been lost may be sown with any kind of seed, 
But must not be planted with any kind of plant; 
Nor may any trees be permitted to remain there except shade-trees which do not produce fruit.   
[Such a field] conveys uncleanness by contact, carriage and overshadowing. 

Explanation
Section one: Today's mishnah deals with a field in which a grave has been lost. Such a field may be planted with seed even if the produce will be plucked. We are not concerned lest a piece of bone get stuck to a plant when it is uprooted and that he will bring it into his home (as we were concerned in yesterday's mishnah) because in such a field the bones were not spread around by plowing. The roots of these types of plants will not reach down to where the body was buried, and therefore there is no concern that when they are uprooted, bones will be uprooted as well.
However, one cannot plant trees there because their roots do reach down to the grave.
It is even forbidden to leave fruit trees there because their roots receive nourishment from the grave. The only type of tree that can be left there is a tree that is meant just for shade and does not yield fruit.
Section two: Since there is an unplowed grave in this field, it conveys impurity in all three waysâ€”contact, carriage and overshadowing. In other words, this field is treated more strictly than a field that had a grave but was plowed over.
