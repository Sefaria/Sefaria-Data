Ohalot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Twelve

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with the various possibilities of where the impurity will be found vis a vis a hive that is found in the open air (not in the house). 

Mishnah Twelve
[In the case where the hive is in the open air] and is one handbreadth high off the ground, if there is uncleanness below it or above it, everything becomes unclean except the inside.
[If the uncleanness is] within, everything becomes unclean. 
When do these rules apply? When [the hive is] a vessel. 
If it is defective, although [it may be] stopped up with straw—or according to the sages, it contains forty seahs— 
Then if an olive-sized [portion] of a corpse is placed below it, [everything] directly [below] to the depths becomes unclean; 
[If placed] above, [everything] directly above to the sky becomes unclean.
[If the uncleanness is] is within [the hive] nothing is unclean except that which is within. 
[If] it was one handbreadth high off the ground, if there was uncleanness below it, what is below becomes unclean;   
[If the uncleanness] was within it, what is within becomes unclean; 
Above it, [everything] directly [above] to the sky becomes unclean.  

Explanation
Section one: The hive acts as a tent to spread the impurity to the sides, both above and below the vessel. The inside remains pure because it is protected by the hive (because it is not susceptible to impurity).
If the uncleanness is within the hive, then it acts as an ohel to spread the impurity to the sides above and below.
Section two: Similar to mishnah two and seven, but here, since there is no house, it is not relevant to discuss it being jammed into a door.
Section three: If it can hold forty seahs then it counts as an ohel to provide a barrier for impurity. 
Sections four-six: See mishnah seven.
Section seven: The hive acts as a barrier to the impurity and limits it to below.
Section eight: The hive acts as an ohel to keep the impurity inside.
Section nine: The impurity is not found in an ohel, and therefore the impurity does not spread. It is limited to defiling things directly above it.
