Ohalot, Chapter Five, Mishnah One

Mishnah One
[With regard to] an oven which stood in a house, with its outlet curved to the outside [of the house], and those burying a corpse overshadowed it:
Bet Shammai says: all becomes unclean.  
Bet Hillel says: the oven becomes unclean, but the house remains clean. 
Rabbi Akiva says: even the oven remains clean.  

Explanation
Section one: The mishnah describes an oven that is inside a house, but whose outlet curves and opens to the outside of the house. The outlet is the hole in the bottom of the oven that lets air in and ashes out. It seems that a pipe has been affixed to the hole to lead it outside.
Outside of the house, people carrying a corpse for burial overshadow (create an ohel) the pipe. 
Section two: Bet Shammai says that everything that is in the house becomes impure. The impurity is considered as entering the oven and since the oven is in the house, the contents of the house are impure.
Section three: Bet Hillel limits the impurity to the oven itself, because they hold that the impurity does not escape from the oven into the house.
Section four: Rabbi Akiva is even more lenient. Even the oven is impure because they overshadowed the pipe and not the oven itself.
