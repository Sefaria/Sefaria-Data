Ohalot, Chapter Seventeen, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
[In the case where] there was a bet peras above a pure field, if rain washed down soil from the bet peras to the pure field, even where this was reddish and the [other soil] turned it white, or where this was white and the other turned it red, this does not make it a bet peras.

Explanation
The mishnah refers to a case where one field is on a step above another field. If the upper field is a bet peras and some of its soil washes in to the lower field, it does not make the lower field a bet peras. This is true even if the fields are of a different color and one can see the color of the earth from the original bet peras.
