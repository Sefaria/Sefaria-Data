Ohalot, Chapter Eighteen, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Our mishnah continues to deal with impurity of Gentile dwelling places and even gets into some specifics as to which cities are impure.  

Mishnah Eight
Colonnades  are not [subject to the laws] of non-Jewish dwelling places.   
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: a non-Jewish city that has been destroyed is not [subject to the laws] of non-Jewish dwelling-places. 
The east [side] of Caesaron and the west [side] of Caesaron are graveyards. 
The east [side] of Acre was doubtful, but the sages declared it clean. 
Rabbi and his law court voted [to decide] about Keni and declared it clean.  

Explanation
Section one: Collonades are roofed but open areas with many columns to support the roofs. Since non-Jews don't bury their miscarriages there, they are pure.
Section two: Wild animals will circulate around in destroyed cities. Therefore, even if miscarriages were once buried there, the wild animals will eat them.
Section three: Caesoron, also known as Caesarea Philippa is near the Jordan springs. Both sides of this ciry were used by non-Jews as graveyards and therefore they are impure.
Section four: The sages weren't sure if there was a graveyard on the east side of Acre, but they declared it clean anyway. Very generous of them.
Section five: Keni is on the southern edge of Israel, according to Albeck, near modern Eilat. Rabbi Judah Hanasi and his court actually had a vote about its purity, and they declared it clean.
