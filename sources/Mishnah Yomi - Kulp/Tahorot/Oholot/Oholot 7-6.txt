Ohalot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This (very well-known) mishnah discusses whether it is permissible to abort a fetus in order to save the life of the mother. 
I should note that this mishnah is the foundation for all Jewish discussion of abortion. Since this is such a controversial and complex issue, I do not think that this is the right forum for a comprehensive discussion (there are many teshuvot on the topic, many of which can be found on the web). We shall stick with the simple meaning of the mishnah.

Mishnah Six
If a woman is having trouble giving birth, they cut up the child in her womb and brings it forth limb by limb, because her life comes before the life of [the child]. 
But if the greater part has come out, one may not touch it, for one may not set aside one person's life for that of another.

Explanation 
Section one: While still in the womb, the fetus's life does not take precedence over the mother's. Indeed, one might not even go so far as to call it a "life." Therefore, the doctors/midwives may cut the fetus up in order to save the life of the mother.
Section two: However, once most of the child has emerged, it is forbidden to do anything to harm the child because it is forbidden to take one life in order to save another. The child is considered to be a "life" once most of it has emerged from the womb.
