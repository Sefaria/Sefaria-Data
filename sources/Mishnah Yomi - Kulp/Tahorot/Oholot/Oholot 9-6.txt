Ohalot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
[In the case of the hive] being one handbreadth high off the ground, 
If there is uncleanness below it or in the house or above it, everything becomes unclean .

Explanation
If the hive is one handbreadth high off the ground, then no matter where the uncleanness is, it will defile everything. If there is uncleanness underneath the hive, it will defile everything else underneath it and anything above it. Similarly, if there is impurity above it, the impurity will spread below for there is no barrier, and from there it will spread to the sides and into the house, as there is nothing sealing the house off. The same is true if the impurity is inside the hive. And unlike the case in mishnah two, here no matter where it is, the impurity will enter the hive itself since the hive's mouth is open to the house and when the house is defiled, the inside of the hive is defiled. In other words, the interior of the hive is reckoned like the house.
