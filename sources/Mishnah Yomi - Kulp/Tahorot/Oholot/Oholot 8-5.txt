Ohalot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
The following neither bring [impurity] nor protect against it: 
Seeds, plants [still] attached to the ground, except for the plants mentioned above, 
A lump of hail, snow, frost, ice and salt. 
[Anything] that hops from one place to another, or leaps from one place to another, a flying bird. 
A loosely-flapping garment, or a ship floating [freely] on the water. 
If the ship were tied with something that can keep it steady, or a stone were [placed so as] to hold down the garment, it can bring uncleanness. 
Rabbi Yose says: a house on a ship cannot bring uncleanness.    

Explanation
Today's mishnah discusses things that act neither to bring uncleanness nor as a barrier for it, even if they are found in a position of overshadowing. 
Section one: Plants (this doesn't include trees) attached to the ground generally do not act as ohalot to bring impurity or protect against it. The exceptions were the very leafy plants mentioned in 8:1. We should note that this is all in reference to plants attached to the ground. Once detached from the ground plants can, under certain circumstances, act as an ohel. 
Section two:  All of these items cannot act as an ohel because they melt. The salt will crumble when rained upon.
Section three: Animals or people that are moving do not form an ohel. To "overshadow" the living thing must be stationary.
Section four: A ship or garment that is moving around also does not act as an ohel. 
Section five: Once the ship is tied down so that it doesn't move around, or the garment is held down by a stone, it can again act as an ohel.
Section six: Although relative to the ship the house is stationary, it does not act as an ohel if the ship is moving. 
Another interpretation is that Rabbi Yose is referring to a make shift sort of house, one that will be uprooted by a common wind. Since such a house will not last long, it does not act as an ohel.
