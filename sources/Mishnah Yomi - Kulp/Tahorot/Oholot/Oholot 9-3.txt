Ohalot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
When do these rules apply? When the hive is a vessel and it is loosely placed in the door.  
If it is defective, although [it may be] stopped up with straw or it is stuck to the side of the door—What is "stuck? Anything which has no opening of one handbreadth—:
Then, if an olive-sized [portion] of a corpse is placed below it, [everything] directly [below the portion] to the depths becomes unclean;   
[If placed] above [the hive everything] directly above to the sky becomes unclean. 
[If the uncleanness is] in the house, nothing becomes unclean except the house. 
[If the uncleanness is] within [the hive] nothing becomes unclean except that which is within [the hive]. 

Explanation
Section one: The rules in the above two mishnayot apply only if the hive is a complete and unbroken vessel and it is loosely placed into the doorway. 
Section two: If the hive is defective, meaning a piece is missing, or it is stuck tightly into the door, then the rules are different. The rest of the mishnah outlines how the impurity spreads if these conditions hold.
Section three: If there is impurity below, the impurity will defile all the way down to the depths, but it will not defile above. Since the hive is not a vessel, it acts as a barrier against the impurity. 
Section four: The same is true if the impurity is above the hive. It will defile anything above it, but the hive acts as a barrier and things that are below are pure. 
Section five: This is the same rule as in mishnah one.
Section six: Since the hive offers a barrier, anything above or below is pure. Only that which is found in the hive is impure.
