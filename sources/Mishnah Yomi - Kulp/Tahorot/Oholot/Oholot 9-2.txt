Ohalot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
[In the case of the hive] being one handbreadth high off the ground, 
If there is uncleanness below it or in the house or above it, everything becomes unclean except that which is within [the hive]. 
[If the uncleanness is] within the hive everything becomes unclean.

Explanation
Section one: If the hive is one handbreadth high off the ground, then it will form an ohel over a piece of impurity that is found below it. This will cause the impurity to spread to the sides. 
Section two: Thus if there is uncleanness underneath the hive, it will defile everything else underneath it and anything above it. Similarly, if there is impurity above the tent, the impurity will spread below for there is no barrier, and from there it will spread to the sides. It will even enter the house, as there is nothing sealing the house off. The only thing that will remain clean is the inside of the hive, as was the case in yesterday's mishnah.
Section three: If there is a space of one handbreadth underneath the hive and there is impurity in the hive, everything is unclean, which is the same halakhah as in yesterday's mishnah.
