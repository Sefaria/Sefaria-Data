Ohalot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five 
If [lying over the hatch] there were vessels made of dung, vessels of stone, or vessels of [unbaked] earth, everything [in the upper story] remains clean. 
If it was a vessel known to be clean for holy things or for [the water of] purification, everything remains clean, since everyone is trusted with [regard to matters of] purification.  
For clean vessels and earthenware vessels that are [known to be] clean protect with the walls of â€˜tents'.

Explanation
Section one: Vessels made of dung, stone or unbaked earth cannot become impure. Such vessels protect everything from becoming impure, even things that can be purified in a mikveh. Therefore, everything in the upper story is pure.
Section two: Even amei haaretz (people who are not generally scrupulous concerning matters of purity) are trustworthy if they claim that the purity of a certain vessel was preserved in order to use it for something holy or for the waters of purification. In other words, the assumption is that these people were not careful about matters of purity when it came to daily life; but in regards to the Temple, they were careful. Since we can assume that these vessels are pure, they protect everything in the upper story from being defiled.
Section three: The language of this section is a bit awkward. Albeck explains it in the following manner. Just as vessels that cannot become impure and have a tightly covered lid prevent impurity from entering, because they are like earthenware vessels (called "pure" because they cannot be defiled from the outside) which protect their contents when they have a tightly covered lid, so too all pure vessels protect against impurity together with the walls of the houses ("tents") in cases where the vessels are on top of the hatch.
