Ohalot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
[With regard to] a hatch  between the house and the upper story, if there was a pot placed over it and it was perforated [by a hole of sufficient size] to admit liquid:
Bet Shammai says: all becomes unclean.  
Bet Hillel says: the pot becomes unclean but the upper story remains clean. 
Rabbi Akiva says: all remains clean.

Explanation
Section one: The opening between the house and the upper story has an earthenware pot placed over it. The pot cannot itself become impure because it is of earthenware. However, the pot has a hole in it large enough to let in a liquid and therefore the pot does not offer protection to the pure things in it, even if it is tightly sealed (see Kelim end of chapter 9). Just as we had three opinions in yesterday's mishnah with regard to the oven, today we have three opinions as to whether impurity in the house goes up through the pot into the upper story.
Section two: Bet Shammai holds that since the pot is perforated it does not prevent the impurity from going up to the second story. The contents of both stories are impure.
Section three: Bet Hillel says that since the pot has a hole large enough to admit liquids, it cannot protect its contents from becoming impure. However, for the impurity to go up to the second story the hole must be a handbreadth wide. Since this hole is much smaller, the contents of the second story remain clean.
Section four: Rabbi Akiva says that the pot is considered to be in the second story and not in the first. Therefore, even the contents of the pot remain clean. As was the case in yesterday's mishnah, Rabbi Akiva seems to make a conscious attempt to rule leniently.
