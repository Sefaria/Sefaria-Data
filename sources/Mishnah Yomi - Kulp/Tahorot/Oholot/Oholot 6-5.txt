Ohalot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
[In the case of] uncleanness among the roof-beams, [with a covering] beneath it thin as thin as garlic-skin,   
If there is a space within of a cubic handbreadth, everything becomes unclean.   
If there is not a space of a cubic handbreadth, the uncleanness is considered plugged up.   
If the uncleanness was visible within the house, in either case the house becomes unclean.

Explanation
Section one: In this case the source of impurity is within the roof-beams, and not within the plastering or the walls. Therefore, the impurity is not part of the building. Separating the impurity from the house is a thin partition, even as thin as the skin of a piece of garlic.
Section two: If the source of impurity is found in a space that has the dimensions of a cubic handbreadth, then it spreads to the rest of the house and to the upper story as well. As we shall see, this is a general principle when it comes to the space in which a piece of impurity is found. If the corpse impurity is in a space that has an opening the size of a cubic handbreadth, then it spreads up and down (and all around). But if it is sealed up, the impurity does not spread, at least not as easily.
Section three: As stated, if the impurity is found in a space that is smaller than a cubic handbreadth, then it does not spread to both the house and the upper story. Rather, in this case it would be considered part of the upper story, and only the contents of the upper story will be impure.
Section four: If the garlic thin separation is not sufficient to hide the source of impurity from being seen in the house, then it doesn't matter whether the space in which the impurity is found. The contents of the house are defiled in both cases, as if the impurity was in the house itself.
