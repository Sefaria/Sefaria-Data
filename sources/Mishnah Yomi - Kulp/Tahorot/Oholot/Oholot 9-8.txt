Ohalot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight 
 [In the case of such a hive] being [placed] one handbreadth high off the ground: 
If there is uncleanness below it, in the house or inside the hive everything is impure except for above it.   
If above [the hive] what is directly above up to the sky becomes unclean. 

Explanation
Section one: The difference between this case and the case in mishnah four is if the mouth is open inward toward the house, then if the uncleanness is in the hive, it also spreads everywhere except for above the hive (and outside the house). 
Section two: This is the same as mishnah four.
