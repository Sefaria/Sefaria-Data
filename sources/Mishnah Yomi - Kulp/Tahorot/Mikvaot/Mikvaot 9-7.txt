Mikvaot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
They do not block in the case of aprons belonging to workers in pitch, potters, or trimmers of trees. 
Rabbi Judah says: the same applies also to summer fruit-driers. 
This is the general rule: if it is something which one cares enough [to remove], it blocks; but if it is something which one does not care enough [to remove], it does not block. 

Explanation
Section one: Since these people don't care how dirty their aprons become, stains never block successful immersion.
Section two: This is the general rule that basically explains the entire chapter. If the person is assumed to want to remove the stain from his clothing, vessel or himself, then it does block immersion. But if he doesn't care that it's there, then the person or article/vessel can be immersed even with the substance on it.
