Mikvaot, Chapter One, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Today's mishnah is basically a repeat of mishnayot 1-3 except here we deal with rainwater that continues to flow into the pool. This rain will continuously nullify the water that has been defiled and put back into the pool. Thus, this water cannot become impure (although water taken out of it can be made impure).
The commentary to this mishnah would be the same as that found in mishnayot 1-3 so I have not repeated it from there. Section two is parallel to mishnah one, section three is parallel to mishnah two, and section four is parallel to mishnah three. Section five is similar to the end of yesterday's mishnah. It notes that this water is pure enough that it can be used in the preparation of terumah. 

Mishnah Six
Superior to such [water] is the water of rain flows which have not stopped.   
If an unclean person drank of it and then a clean person drank of it, he is clean.
If an unclean person drank of it and water was then drawn from it in a clean vessel, it is clean.
If an unclean person drank of it and a loaf of terumah fell in, even if he washed his hand in it, it is clean.
If one drew water from it in an unclean vessel and then a clean person drank [out of the pool], he is clean.
If one drew water from it in an unclean vessel and a loaf of terumah fell [into the pool], even if he washed his hands in it, it is clean.
If unclean water fell into it and a clean person drank of it, he is clean.
If unclean water fell into it and one drew water from it in a clean vessel, it is clean.
If unclean water fell into it and a loaf of terumah fell in, even if he washed his hands in it, it is clean. 
[All such water] is valid for terumah and for the washing of the hands.
