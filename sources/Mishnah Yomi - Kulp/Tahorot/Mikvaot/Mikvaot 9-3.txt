Mikvaot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Today's mishnah deals with clumps of matted hair that do not block successful immersion from occurring. 

Mishnah Three
The following do not block: the matted hair of the head and of the armpits and of a man's hidden parts. 
Rabbi Eliezer says: it is the same with a man or a woman: if it is something which one finds annoying, it blocks; but if it is something which one does not find annoying, it does not interpose. 

Explanation
Section one: These types of matted hair do not block successful immersion from occurring, in contrast with those found in yesterday's mishnah which do. Note that male pubic hair does not block immersion, whereas female pubic hair does.  
Section two: Rabbi Eliezer issues a more egalitarian ruling. No matter the gender, if the person finds the matted hair annoying, then it blocks immersion. This same general rule is found in mishnah seven. Rabbi Eliezer differs from the other sages in that he applies it also to pubic hair.
