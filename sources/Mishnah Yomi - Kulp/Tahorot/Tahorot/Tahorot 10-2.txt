Toharot, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
If the olive-workers in an olive-press went in and out, and in the olive-press there was unclean liquid, if there is space enough [on the ground] between the liquid and the olives for their feet to be dried on the ground, the olive workers remain clean.   
If something unclean was found in front of olive-workers in the olive-press or grape harvesters, they are believed to say, "We have not touched it." 
And the same law applies also to the young children among them.   
They may go outside the door of the olive-press and relieve themselves behind the wall, and still be deemed clean. 
How far may they go and still be deemed clean? As far as they can be seen.

Explanation
Section one: This section deals with clean olive-press workers. There is unclean liquid on the floor inside the olive press. The workers tread on the liquid with their bare feet. This does not cause them to be impure because impure liquid does not defile people. But, if this liquid comes into contact with the olives, it will defile it. If there is space enough for them to walk on the ground and have their feet dried off before they get to the olives, then the olives are clean. 
Section two: In general, olive workers and grape-harvesters are believed to say that they didn't touch something unclean. Similarly, they are believed to say that the grapes or olives that they are working with were not touched by any children who are categorically assumed to be impure.
Section three: The olive-workers can go outside of the olive-press in order to "go to the bathroom" (this is how we like to say this, but obviously there was no bathroom back then). They are not assumed to be impure unless they go further away than they can be seen. [The consequences of this would of course be that the area surrounding the olive press might get a bit dirty. Something you might want to keep in mind next time you order Israeli olive oil!]
