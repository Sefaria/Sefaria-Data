Toharot, Chapter One, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Today's mishnah continues to deal with pieces of dough that have different levels of impurity and then become stuck together.

Mishnah Eight
A piece of dough that had first degree uncleanness, and then others became stuck to it, they all become unclean in the first degree.
If they were separated, it still remains unclean in the first degree but all the others are have only second degree uncleanness.   
If [the original piece] had second degree uncleanness and then others became stuck to it, they all become unclean in the second degree;   
If they were separated, it still remains unclean in the second degree but all the others are only unclean in the third degree. 
If [the original piece] had third degree uncleanness, and then other became stuck to it, it remains unclean in the third degree but all the others remain clean, whether they were subsequently separated from it or whether they were not separated.

Explanation
Section one: The pieces of dough that are stuck to the original piece of dough are considered to become part of the original piece. Therefore they too have impurity in the first degree.
If they are subsequently separated, the original piece retains its first degree impurity. The other pieces have second degree impurity because they came into contact with the piece that had first degree impurity.
Section two: The same situation as in section one, just the original piece has second degree impurity. [This tractate seems to enjoy doing thisâ€”repeating the same scenarios over and over again with foods that have different levels of impurity.]
Section three: Something that has only third degree impurity does not defile other things, even if the other thing is attached to it. It only invalidates holy food and the bread referred to here is probably terumah.
