Toharot, Chapter Four, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two 
A dead sheretz that was held in the mouth of a weasel that was passing over loaves of terumah and it is doubtful whether the sheret did or did not touch them, in such condition of doubt [the loaves] are clean.

Explanation
As in yesterday's mishnah, today's mishnah describes a case of moving doubtful impurity. The dead sheretz, a source of impurity, is moving for it is in the mouth of a weasel. Since the sheretz is moving and we don't know for sure if it touched the loaves, the loaves remain pure.
However, you might just want to think twice before you eat themâ€¦
