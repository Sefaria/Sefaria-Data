Toharot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
If the wife of an am haaretz entered a haver's house to take out his son or his daughter or his cattle, the house remains clean, since she had entered it without permission.

Explanation
The assumption in this mishnah is that the wife of the am haaretz does not stay in the house. She goes in to take out one the child or animal of the haver (a person who is strict about the purity laws, the opposite of the am haaeretz) and she immediately leaves. "Without permission" does not mean that she entered the house without permission. It means that she didn't have permission to stay. Therefore, the things in the house remain pure.
