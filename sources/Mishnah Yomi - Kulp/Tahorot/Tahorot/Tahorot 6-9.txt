Toharot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Nine

Mishnah Nine
A covered forum:: is a private domain in respect of Shabbat and a public domain in respect of the laws of uncleanness; 
And so too the sides.   
Rabbi Meir says: the sides are regarded as a private domain in both respects.   
Colonnades: are a private domain in respect of Shabbat and a public domain in respect of the laws of uncleanness. 
A courtyard into which many people enter by one door and leave by another, is a private domain in respect of Shabbat and a public domain in respect of the laws of cleanness.

Explanation
Section one: I have translated the term that begins this mishnah, in Hebrew "paran," in accordance with most commentators explanation, who say it is similar to a basilica. The forum is considered a private domain for Shabbat, but since many people have access to it, it is a public domain for matters of uncleanness.
Section two: The sides of the forum are, according to the first opinion, treated the same way as is the forum itself. 
However, Rabbi Meir says that since people are not found as much on the sides, it is considered a private domain even for matters of impurity.
Section two: The "colonnades" referred to here is a hall that is supported by columns and is open on multiple ends. 
Section three: A courtyard typically has one main entrance and would not be considered a public domain for any matter. But if people go in one door and then go out another door, it has become a public thoroughfare. In such a case it is not a public domain for the matter of Shabbat, but it is a public domain for matters of impurity.
