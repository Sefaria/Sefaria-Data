Toharot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight
One who was clean and had given up the thought of eating [pure food]: 
Rabbi Judah says that it remains clean, since it is usual for unclean persons to keep away from it.   
But the sages say that it is deemed unclean.   
If his hands were clean and he had given up the thought of eating [pure food], even though he says, "I know that my hands have not become unclean," his hands are unclean, since the hands are always busy.

Explanation
Section one: The person described here is someone who usually eats his food while the food is pure (as he is). Then he decides to no longer eat in a state of purity. Rabbi Judah says that the food remains pure because people have grown accustomed to staying away from his food because they know that he wants it to be pure. The other sages disagree and say that once he decides to no longer eat pure food, we can't be sure that he preserved the purity of this food and it must be assumed to be impure. 
Section two: Once the person decides to no longer eat his food in a state of purity, he can't really be trusted to keep his hands pure. Hands are "busy"â€”they constantly touch things. Therefore, even if he thinks he preserved their purity, his hands are unclean.
