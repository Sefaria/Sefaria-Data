Toharot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
One who put his olives in a basket that they might be softened so that they will be easy to press, they become susceptible to uncleanness;   
[If he put them in a basket] to be softened so that they may be salted:
Bet Shammai says: they become susceptible. 
Bet Hillel says: they do not become susceptible.   
One who splits his olives with unwashed hands, he causes them to be unclean.   

Explanation
Section one: The olives put into this basket to be softened so that they can be crushed will expel some sap. The sap causes them to be susceptible to impurity. This is because the person wants them to expel some of their juices, for in the end he is going to crush them to make olive oil in any case. 
Section two: In contrast, if he puts them in a basket to soften so that they can be salted, Bet Hillel holds that they are not susceptible to impurity. This is because he doesn't really want them to expel their liquid.
Bet Shammai holds that they are susceptible to impurity even in this case. It is possible that Bet Shammai simply holds that susceptibility to impurity is not dependent upon a person's intention—whether the person wants the liquid to have contacted the produce or not. This is typical of a Shammaite system of halakhah—the halakhah is less determined by intention and more determined by reality, i.e. what actually happened. 
Section three: Here he clearly intends for the liquid to come out and therefore even Bet Hillel agrees that the liquid causes them to be susceptible. Since his hands have not been washed, we assume that they are impure and the olives are impure.
