Toharot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
One who left his clothes in the cubbies of the bath house attendants:   
Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says that they are clean,   
But the sages say: [they are not clean] unless he gives him the key or the seal or unless he left some sign on them. 
One who left   his clothes from one wine-pressing to the next, his clothes remain clean.
If he left them with an Israelite [the clothes are unclean] unless he says, "I have watched over them carefully."

Explanation
Section one: The mishnah describes bath house attendants to whom one gives his clothes to watch over while bathing. The bath house attendant would put the clothes in the cubby. The fear is that someone else might have touched the clothes and thereby defiled them. Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah rules lenientlyâ€”the clothes are assumed to have been watched over and they are pure. 
The other sages rule more strictly. The clothes are pure only if the owner takes some precaution to make sure no one else touches them. If the attendant gives him the key they are pure. If he gives him a seal to make sure no one opens the cubby, they are also pure. Finally, if he puts a sign on the clothes so that he could tell if they were touched, then they are pure.
Section two: This refers to a priest who wants to make sure that the wine he presses is pure. Therefore he has special clothes that he uses just for wine pressing. If he leaves them from one wine pressing to the next, they can stay pure.
Section three: However, if he gives them to a regular Israelite to watch over, the Israelite must be able to declare that he watched over them carefully. If he is not sure, then the clothes must be treated as potentially having been defiled.
