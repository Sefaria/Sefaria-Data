Toharot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
If the wife of a haver left the wife of an am haaretz grinding grain in her house, if the handmill stopped turning, the house is unclean.   
But if the handmill did not stop turning, that part of the house which she can stretch out her hand and touch is unclean. 
If there were two women, the house is unclean in either case, since while the one is grinding, the other can go about touching, the words of Meir. 
But the sages say: the only part that is unclean is where she can stretch out her hand and touch it.

Explanation
Section one: A haver is a term used to describe the opposite of an am haaretz. The wife of a haver has the status of a haver. She leaves the wife of an am haaretz, who also has the status of am haaretz, grinding a handmill in her home. If the am haaretz stops turning the mill, we must suspect that she will walk around the house and touch things. Therefore, all of the objects in the house are suspected of being impure.
But if she kept milling the whole time, we need only be concerned about the things that are close enough for her to reach out and touch.
Section two: If there were two women in the house taking turns at grinding (this is hard work), then Rabbi Meir is consistent with his position from mishnayot two and three, the whole house is impure. The other sages are also consistent. We need only be concerned lest she touched things that are within hand's reach.
