Toharot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
If tax collectors entered a house, the house is unclean.   
If a Gentile was with them  they are believed if they say, "we did not enter" but they are not believed if they say "we didn't touch anything."   
If  thieves entered a house, only that part in which the feet of the thieves have stepped is unclean.   
And what do they cause to be unclean? Food and liquids and open earthenware, but couches and seats and earthenware that have tightly fitting covers remain clean. 
If a Gentile or a woman was with them, all is unclean.

Explanation
Section one: The tax collectors are amei haaretz and since they enter the house to collect something in lieu of taxes we must be concerned that they touched the things in the house and therefore everything is impure. 
Section two: I have explained this section according to Albeck's preferred version. 
If a Gentile boss is with the tax collectors they are only believed to say that we didn't go into a certain house or room. But they are not believed to say that they didn't touch something in certain room into which we know they entered because the Gentile would have instructed them to touch whatever he felt was necessary. However, if no Gentile is with them then they are even believed if they say that they didnâ€™t touch anything, since they came with a specific purpose in mind.
Section three: Thieves who come into a house will only defile the places where we know they walked. We can assume that thieves are going to want to be in and out as quickly as possible, therefore we need not fear that they walked elsewhere and touched other things.
Section four: This is the same as in mishnah five above.
Section five: A Gentile and a female am haaretz both defile by sitting on something or by shifting earthenware vessels. Therefore, everything in the house is impure.
