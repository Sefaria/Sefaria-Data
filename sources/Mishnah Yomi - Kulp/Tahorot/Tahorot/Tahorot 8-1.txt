Toharot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah One

Introduction
Chapter eight continues to deal with a person cautious about matters of purity who lives in close proximity to an am haaretz, one who does not observe the laws of purity. 

Mishnah One
One who dwells in a courtyard with an am haaretz and forgot some vessels in the courtyard, even though they were jars with tightly fitting lids, or an oven with a tightly fitting cover, they are unclean.  
Rabbi Judah says that an oven is clean if it has a tightly fitting lid. 
Rabbi Yose says: even an oven is unclean unless he made for it a partition ten handbreadths high.

Explanation
Section one: All of the vessels that he leaves in the courtyard are impure lest they were defiled by the am haaretz. Earthenware jars with tightly fitting lids cannot be defiled by touch, but if a niddah (a menstruating woman) shifts them, they are impure. Since this might have occurred, the mishnah says these too must be regarded as impure. The first opinion does not differentiate between ovens and other vessels with tightly fitting covers.
Section two: Rabbi Judah says that the oven can be regarded as clean because it is impossible to shift it, since it is attached to the ground.
Section three: Rabbi Yose rules that even the oven is unclean for we are concerned that the am haaretz may have opened the lid to use the oven. Therefore, to preserve the purity of the oven he must keep the am haaretz away by making a partition at least ten handbreadths high. 
As a side note, it is again interesting that the mishnah assumes such a high degree of contact between the "haver" (the opposite of the am haaretz) and the "am haaretz." People of complete opposite religious inclinations and observances may end up living even in the same courtyard, and if so, the haver will simply have to be more cautious about the purity of his vessels.
