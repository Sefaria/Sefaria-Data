Toharot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
If a man entered a valley in the rainy season  and there was an uncleanness in a certain field, and he stated, "I went into that place  but I do not know whether I entered that field   or not:
Rabbi Eliezer rules that he is clean;
But the sages rule that he is unclean.   

Explanation
In mishnah seven below, we will learn that during the rainy months, a field in the valley is a private domain. Therefore, we again have a case where a person is not sure whether he entered a private domain. Rabbi Eliezer considers this a case of doubtful entrance, and as we learned in yesterday's mishnah, in such cases Rabbi Eliezer rules that he is clean. The other sages rule more strictly and deem him to be unclean.
