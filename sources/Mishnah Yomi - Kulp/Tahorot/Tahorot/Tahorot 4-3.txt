Toharot, Chapter Four, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah is based on the distinction that we have seen several times alreadyâ€”if the source of impurity was moving, and we are not sure if it defiled someone or something, the doubt remains pure. But if the source of impurity was considered to be stationary, the doubt is impure. 

Mishnah Three
A weasel that had in its mouth a [dead] sheretz or a dog that had carrion in its mouth and they passed between clean [persons] or if clean persons passed between them,   their condition of doubt is deemed clean, since the uncleanness , had no resting place.   
If they were picking at them while these   lay on the ground,   and a person stated, "I went to that place but I do not know whether I did or did not touch it,"   his condition of doubt is deemed unclean, since the uncleanness had a resting place. 

Explanation
Section one: A dead sheretz and carrion both defile. But since they were moving by being held by the weasel or dog, the people among whom these things moved are clean. 
Section two: In case two, the dog or weasel are picking at the sheretz or carrion and dragging them on the ground. Despite the fact that the sources of defilement are indeed moving, the mishnah considers anything on the ground to be stationary. Therefore, they do defile the people who might have walked among them.
