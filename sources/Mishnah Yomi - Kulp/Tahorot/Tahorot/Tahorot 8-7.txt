Toharot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
The outer parts of vessels that have contracted uncleanness from liquids: 
Rabbi Eliezer says: they defile liquids but they do not disqualify foods.  
Rabbi Joshua says: they defile liquids and also disqualify foods. 
Shimon the brother of Azariah says: neither this nor that. Rather, liquids that were defiled from the outer parts of vessels defile at one remove and disqualify at a second remove. 
It is as if it say, "that which defiled you did not defile me but you have defiled me."

Explanation
Section one: The outsides of these vessels are impure through contact with impure liquids but the inside remains pure. This is a light form of impurity, and the sages will now debate just how light it is. 
Rabbi Eliezer holds that the backs of the vessels defile liquids, even non-sacred liquids. They don't defile regular food and neither does it disqualify terumah.
Rabbi Joshua says that it even disqualifies terumah food. This is because the liquids that defiled the vessel cause the vessel to have second degree impurity. Second degree impurity defiles liquids and disqualifies terumah.
Section two: According to Albeck, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua were arguing about an older halakhah. Shimon brother of Azariah responds that both of them are incorrect for neither recited the ancient halakhah correctly. Rather, the earlier sages had said that if liquid is defiled by the outer portion of a vessel it has first degree impurity. It will defile terumah and give it second degree impurity. If this terumah that has second degree impurity has contact with other food, it will disqualify it. 
The final line of the mishnah is a personification of the food (such personifications were found in Parah 8:2-7). The food says to the liquidâ€”that which defiled you, the outside of the vessel, was not sufficient to defile me. For the outside of vessels can only defile liquids. But you, Mr. Defiled Liquid, you did defile me!
