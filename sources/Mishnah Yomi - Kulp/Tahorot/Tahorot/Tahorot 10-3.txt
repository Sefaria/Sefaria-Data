Toharot, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with taking the olive or grape workers to a mikveh for them to immerse themselves and the vessels with which they will be working. 

Mishnah Three
If the olive-workers or the grape harvesters were only brought within the domain of the cavern, it is sufficient, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
Rabbi Yose says: he should stand over them until they immerse.   
Rabbi Shimon say: if they regard the vessels as clean, one must stand over them until they immerse; but if they regard them as unclean, it is not necessary to stand over them until they immerse. 

Explanation
Section one: The mikveh in which they are immersing happens to be found in a cavern, as mikvaot probably often were in this period. According to Rabbi Meir it is sufficient for the employer who wants to preserve the purity of his grapes or olives to bring the workers to the cave. Once he sees that they have entered, he can trust that they will immerse themselves and the vessels. [This kind of reminds me of telling your kid to get in the shower. Do you need to make sure that he soaps and shampoos? I'm sure you know what I'm talking about].
Section two: Rabbi Yose does not trust that the workers will immerse without supervision. 
Section three: This is similar to Rabbi Shimon's opinion in mishnah one. The workers can be trusted if they think that the vessels or their bodies are unclean. However, if they think they and the vessels are clean, he must make sure they immerse them and themselves.
