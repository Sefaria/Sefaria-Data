Toharot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah is basically the same mishnah as yesterday's mishnah, except the doubt about whether the person was impure is slightly different. In today's mishnah the person is not sure whether he touched a frog, in which case he is pure, or a sheretz, a dead creepy crawly thing, in which case he is impure. The mishnah teaches that the rule here is the same as the rule in yesterday's mishnah concerning one who walked down two paths, one of which was impure. For an explanation, see yesterday's mishnah. 

Mishnah Four
If there was a sheretz and a frog in a public domain and a man touched one of them   and then prepared clean foods which were subsequently consumed; and then he immersed, and then he touched the other and then prepared clean foods, the latter are deemed clean.  
If the first foods were still in existence both must be held in suspense.   
If he did not immerse in the meanwhile, the first are held in suspense and the second must be burnt   .
