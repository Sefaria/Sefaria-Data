   . A phylactery     is regarded as consisting of four vessels. If  the first compartment was unloosed,     and then it was mended it  retains its corpse uncleanness. So is it also the case with the second  and the third.     If the fourth was unloosed     it be comes free from  corpse uncleanness but is still unclean from contact with corpse  uncleanness.     If subsequently the first compartment was again  unloosed and mended it remains unclean from contact.     So also in the  case of the second compartment.     If the third compartment was  subsequently unloosed and mended it becomes clean, since the fourth  is unclean from contact,     and what is unclean from contact cannot  convey uncleanness by contact.  
mishnah

   . A bed the half of which is stolen or lost, or one which  brothers or joint owners divided between themselves, becomes clean.      If it was restored     it is susceptible to uncleanness henceforth.     A bed  may contract uncleanness and be rendered clean     only when all its  parts are bound together; so r. Eliezer. But the sages ruled: it can  contract uncleanness and be rendered clean     even in single parts.      Mishna - mas. Kelim chapter       
mishnah

   . If a man dismantled a bed in order that he might immerse it,    any one who touches the ropes   remains clean.   When   does the rope    begin to constitute a connective with the bed? As soon as three rows of  meshes of it have been knotted.   And [if an other rope was tied to this  one] any person who touches it from the knot inwards becomes  unclean; but if from the knot outwards he remains clean. As to the  loose ends of the knot, any one that touches that part which is needed  for it   becomes unclean. And how much is needed for it?   R. Judah  stated: three fingerbreadths.  
mishnah

   . A rope that hangs over from [the netting of] a bed   is  clean   if it is shorter than five handbreadths, but unclean if it is from  five to ten handbreadths long, while that part which is over the ten  hand breadths is clean; for it is only with the former     that paschal  lambs were tied     and beds suspended.      
mishnah

   . If a part of a bed-girth hangs over, it is unclean     whatever  its length;     so r. Meir. R. Jose ruled: only that which is shorter than  ten handbreadths.     The remnant of a bed-girth     remains unclean if  the length is no less than seven handbreadths from which an ass's  girth can be made.      
mishnah

   . If a zab was carried on a bed and on its girth,     the latter      causes an uncleanness of two grades     and an unfitness     of one  grade;     so r. Meir. R. Jose ruled: if a zab was carried on a bed and on its  girth     the part that is shorter than ten handbreadths causes an  uncleanness of two grades     and an unfitness     of one grade,     but that  which is over the ten handbreadths     causes only an uncleanness of  one grade     and an unfitness     of one grade.     If he was carried on the  bed-girth, [on the overhanging part] that was shorter than ten  handbreadths, it becomes unclean,     but if on the part that was longer  than ten handbreadths it remains clean.      
mishnah

   . If around a bed that had contracted midras uncleanness  one wrapped a bed-girth, the whole becomes subject to midras  uncleanness; if it was subsequently removed, the bed remains subject  to midras uncleanness but the bed-girth is unclean only from contact  with midras. If the bed was subject to a seven-day uncleanness and a  bed-girth was subsequently wrapped around it, the whole becomes  subject to a seven-day uncleanness; if it was removed, the bed remains  subject to a seven-day uncleanness but the bed-girth is subject only to  evening uncleanness. If the bed was subject to evening uncleanness  and around it was subsequently wrapped a bed-girth, the whole  becomes subject to evening uncleanness; if it was removed, the bed  remains subject to evening uncleanness but the bed-girth becomes  clean.  
mishnah

   . If a bed-girth was wrapped around a bed and a corpse  touched them, they are subject to a seven-day uncleanness;     if they  are taken apart they     are still subject to a seven-day uncleanness. If  a sheretz touched them they are subject to an evening  uncleanness; if they are taken apart they     are still subject to evening  uncleanness. If from a bed     the two longer sides were removed     and  two new ones were prepared for it but the original sockets were not  changed, if the new sides were broken the bed     retains its  uncleanness,     but if the old ones were broken it becomes clean, since      all depends on the old ones.      
mishnah

   . A box whose opening is at the top is susceptible to corpse  uncleanness.     If it was damaged above it is still susceptible to corpse  uncleanness. If it was damaged below, it     becomes clean. The  compartments     within it remain unclean and are not regarded as a  connective with it.      
mishnah

   . If a shepherd's bag     was damaged, the pocket within it  retains its uncleanness and is not regarded as a connective with it. If  the testicle bags in a skin     serve also     as receptacles     and they were  damaged, they become clean,     since they     will no longer serve their  original purpose.      
mishnah

   . A box whose opening is at the side is susceptible to both  midras uncleanness     and corpse uncleanness. R. Jose stated: when does  this apply? When it is less than ten handbreadths in height     or when it  has not a rim one handbreadth deep.     If it was damaged above it is still  susceptible to corpse uncleanness.     If it was damaged below, r. Meir  rules that it is susceptible to uncleanness,     but the sages rule that it  is clean because where the primary function     ceases     the secondary  one     also ceases.  
mishnah

     . A dung-basket that was so damaged     that it will not  hold pomegranates, r. Meir rules, is still susceptible to uncleanness,      but the sages rule that it is clean because where the primary  function     ceases the secondary one     also ceases.  Mishna - mas. Kelim chapter       
mishnah

   . Bolsters, pillows, sacks and packing cases that were  damaged   are still susceptible to midras uncleanness.   A fodder-bag  that can hold four kab, a shepherd's bag that can hold five kab, a  travelling bag that can hold a se'ah, a skin that can hold seven kab (r.  Judah ruled: also a spice-bag and a food wallet that can hold the  smallest quantity) are still susceptible to midras uncleanness.   If any  of them, however, was damaged it becomes clean, since where the  primary function   ceases   the secondary function   also ceases.  
mishnah

   . A bagpipe is not susceptible to midras uncleanness.   A  trough for mixing mortar, beth shammai rules, is susceptible to midras  uncleanness   , and beth hillel rules that it is susceptible to corpse  uncleanness only.   If a trough of a capacity from two log to nine kab  is split, it becomes susceptible to midras uncleanness.     If it was left in  the rain and it swelled     it is susceptible to corpse uncleanness  alone.     [if it was left out] during the east wind and it split, it is  susceptible to midras uncleanness.     In this respect the law is more  restricted in the case of remnants of wooden vessels than in [that of  such vessels] in their original condition.     It is also more restricted in  regard to the remnants of wicker vessels than [to such vessels] as are  in their original condition, for when they are in their original  condition they are insusceptible to uncleanness until their rim is  finished, but after their rim has been finished, even though their edges  fell away leaving only the slightest trace of them, they are unclean.  
mishnah

   . If a stick was used     as a haft for a hatchet, it     is regarded  as a connective     for uncleanness at the time of use. A yarn winder is  regarded as a connective     for uncleanness at the time of its use. If it  was fixed to a pole it is susceptible to uncleanness,     but the latter  cannot be regarded as a connective with it. If the pole itself was      converted into a yarn winder, only that part     which is needed for use  is susceptible to uncleanness. A seat that was fixed to the pole is  susceptible to uncleanness, but the latter is not regarded as a  connective with it. If the pole was turned into a seat, only the place of  the seat is susceptible to uncleanness. A seat that was fixed to the  beam of an olive-press is susceptible to uncleanness, but the latter is  not connective with it. If the end of a beam was turned into a seat it  remains clean, because people would tell him,     ‘get up and let us do  our work’.      
mishnah

   . If a large trough was so damaged that it could no longer  hold pomegranates and it was adapted as a seat, r. Akiba rules that it  becomes susceptible to uncleanness, but the sages rule that it remains  clean unless its rough parts have been smoothed.     If it was turned  into a crib for cattle, even if it was fixed to a wall, it is susceptible to  uncleanness.      
mishnah

   . A block     that was fixed to a course of a wall, whether it  was only fixed and not built upon or built upon and not fixed, is  susceptible to uncleanness.     If it was fixed and also built upon, it     is  clean.     Matting that was spread over the roof-beams,     whether it was  fixed and no plasterwork was laid over it or whether plasterwork  was laid over it and it was not fixed, it is susceptible to uncleanness.      If it was fixed and plasterwork was laid over it, it is clean.     A dish  that was fixed to a chest, box or cupboard in such a manner as to hold  its contents in the usual way     is susceptible to uncleanness,     but if it  was in a manner that it cannot hold it in the usual way     it is clean.      
mishnah

   . If a sheet that was susceptible to the uncleanness of  midras was made into a curtain,     it becomes insusceptible to midras  uncleanness but     is susceptible to corpse uncleanness. When does it  become insusceptible to uncleanness?     Beth shammai ruled: when it  has been cut up.     Beth hillel ruled: when the loops have been tied to it.  R. Akiba ruled: when it has been fixed.      
mishnah

   . A mat     provided with reeds that stretched lengthwise is  insusceptible to uncleanness;     but the sages rule: only if they lay in  the shape of [the greek letter] chi.     If they were laid along its width  and there was a distance of less than four handbreadths     between  any two reeds, it is insusceptible to uncleanness.     If it was divided  along its width, r. Judah rules that is clean.     So also, where the end  knots     are untied, it is clean.     If it was divided along its length     but  three end-knots remained intact across a stretch of six  handbreadths,     it is susceptible to uncleanness. When does a mat  become susceptible to uncleanness? When its rough ends are trimmed,  this being the completion of its manufacture.  Mishna - mas. Kelim chapter       
mishnah

   . A man who touches the upper beam,   the lower beam,   the  heddles, the sley, the thread that is drawn   over purple material,   or a  spool which is not to be shot back,   remains clean.   If he touches the  woof, the standing warp,   the double thread that is drawn over purple  material   or a spool which is to be shot back,   he becomes unclean.   If a  man touches the wool that is on the distaff, or on the spool, he remains  clean. If he touches the spinner before it was laid bare   he becomes  unclean, but if he touches it after it was laid bare     he remains clean.  
mishnah

   . If a man touched the yoke,     the crossbar, the collar-piece,  or the thick ropes,     even at the time they are used, he remains clean.      If he touched the tail piece, knee or handle,     he becomes unclean. If he  touched the metal rings,     the guides,     or the flanks,     he becomes  unclean. R. Judah rules that he remains clean if he touched the guides,  since they only serve to increase the soil.      
mishnah

   . If a man touched the handle of a saw     at either end     he  becomes unclean;     but if he touched its string,     cord,     cross-piece or  side-pieces, a carpenter's press,     or the bow-handle of a bow-drill,     he  remains clean.     R. Judah ruled: also he who touches the frame of a  large saw     remains clean. If a man touched the bow-string     or the  bow, even though it was stretched, he remains clean.     A mole-trap is  clean.     R. Judah ruled: while it is set the separate parts are [regarded  as] connected.  Mishna - mas. Kelim chapter       
mishnah

   . If a table   or a side-board   was damaged or covered with  marble   but room   was left on it where cups could be set, it remains  unclean. R. Judah ruled: there must be room enough   for pieces of food.    
mishnah

   . A table   one of whose legs was lost becomes clean.   If a  second leg was lost it is still clean. But if a third was lost   it becomes  unclean where the owner has the intention of using it.     R. Jose ruled:  no intention is necessary.     The same law applies also to the  side-board.      
mishnah

   . A bench     one of whose legs was lost becomes clean.     If its  second leg also was lost it     is still clean. If, however, it     was one  handbreadth high     it remains unclean. A footstool     one of whose legs  was lost remains unclean;     and the same law applies to the stool in  front of a cathedra.      
mishnah

   . If a bride's stool lost its seatboards,     beth shammai rule  that it is still susceptible to uncleanness,     and beth hillel rule that  it is clean.     Shammai ruled: even the frame of the stool     is susceptible  to uncleanness. If a stool was fixed to a baking-trough,     beth shammai  rule that it     is susceptible to uncleanness.     And beth hillel rule that  it is clean.     Shammai ruled: even one     made out of it     is susceptible to  uncleanness.      
mishnah

   . If the seat boards     of a stool did not project     and they  were removed, it     is still susceptible to uncleanness, for it is usual      to turn it on its side and to sit on it.  
mishnah

   . If the middle seat board of a stool was lost but the outer  ones     remained it is still susceptible to uncleanness. If the outer  ones     were lost and the middle seat board remained it is also  susceptible to uncleanness. R. Simeon ruled: only if it     was a  handbreadth wide.      
mishnah

   . If the two adjacent seat boards of a stool were lost, r.  Akiba ruled, it is susceptible to uncleanness; and the sages rule that it  is clean. Said r. Judah: also if the seat boards of a bride's stool were  lost,     though the receptacle under remained,     it is clean, since where  the primary function has ceased     the secondary one     also ceases.  
mishnah

   . A chest     whose top part     was lost is still susceptible to  uncleanness on account of its bottom; if its bottom was lost it is still  susceptible to uncleanness on account of its top part.     If both the top  part and the bottom were lost, r. Judah rules that it is susceptible to  uncleanness on account of its sides,     and the sages rule that it is  clean. A stonecutter's seat     is subject to midras uncleanness.      
mishnah

   . If a [wooden] block was painted red or saffron, or was  polished, r. Akiba rules that it is susceptible to uncleanness,     but the  sages     rule that it remains clean unless it was hollowed out.     A  small basket or a big one that was filled with straw or flocking  remains clean     if it was prepared as a seat;     but if it was plaited over  with reed-grass or with a cord     it becomes susceptible to  uncleanness.      
mishnah

     . A night stool     is subject to both midras and corpse  uncleanness. If the leather seat was sundered,     the leather     is  subject to midras uncleanness and the iron     is subject only to corpse  uncleanness. A tripod stool whose cover is of leather is subject to  both midras and corpse uncleanness. If it was taken apart, the  leather     is subject to midras uncleanness while the tripod     is  altogether clean. A bath-house bench     that has two wooden legs is      susceptible to uncleanness.     If one leg was of wood and the other of  stone it     is clean. If boards in a bath-house were joined together,     r.  Akiba rules that they are susceptible to [midras] uncleanness;     but  the sages rule that they are clean, since they are made only for the  water to flow under them.     A fumigation-cage that contains a  receptacle for garments is susceptible to uncleanness,     but one that  is made like a bee-hive     is clean.  Mishna - mas. Kelim chapter       
mishnah

   . If a ball, a shoe-last, an amulet or tefillin   were torn,   he  that touches them becomes unclean,   but he that touches their  contents   remains clean. If a saddle was torn,   he that touches its  contents   becomes unclean, because the stitching joins them.    
mishnah

   . The following are susceptible to uncleanness   as objects  that are fit for riding upon:   an ashkelon girth, a median mortar,   a  camel's pack-saddle, and a horse-cloth.     R. Jose ruled: a horse- cloth      is also susceptible to uncleanness   as a seat,     since people stand on it      in the arena;     but a saddle of a female camel is susceptible to  uncleanness.      
mishnah

   . What is the practical difference between [the uncleanness  as an object used for] riding upon and [as one used for] sitting upon? In  the case of the former the effect of contact with it     is different from  the effect of carrying it,     but in the case of the latter there is no  difference between the effect of coming in contact with it or carrying  it.     The pack-frame of an ass on which a zab has sat remains clean;      but if the size of the spaces     has been changed     or if they have been  broken one into another     it is susceptible to uncleanness.      
mishnah

   . The bier, the mattress and the pillow of a corpse are  susceptible to the uncleanness of midras.     A bride's stool, a midwife's  travailing stool, and a fuller's stool on which he piles     the clothes, r.  Jose ruled, cannot be regarded as a seat.      
mishnah

   . A fishing net is susceptible to uncleanness on account of  its bag.     Nets, snares, bird-traps, slings and fishermen's     skeins are  susceptible to uncleanness.     A fish-trap, a bird-basket and a bird- cage  are not susceptible to uncleanness.  
mishnah

   . Three   different laws   are applicable to shields: the bent  shield   is susceptible to midras uncleanness;   the shield with which  combatants play in the arena is susceptible to corpse uncleanness;    and the toy-shield of the arabs   is free from all uncleanness.  
mishnah

   . Three different laws are applicable to wagons: one made  like a cathedra   is susceptible to midras uncleanness;   one made like a  bed is susceptible to corpse uncleanness,   and one for [the transport  of] stones is free from all uncleanness.  
mishnah

   . Three different laws are applicable to baking-troughs: if a  baking-trough of a capacity from two log to nine kab was split   it is  susceptible to midras uncleanness; if it was whole it is susceptible to  corpse uncleanness; and if it holds the prescribed measure   it is free  from all uncleanness.  
mishnah

   . Three different laws apply to boxes: a box whose opening is  at the sides     is susceptible to midras uncleanness; if it is on the top it is  susceptible to corpse uncleanness;     and if it holds the prescribed  measure   it is free from all uncleanness.  
mishnah

   . Three different laws are applicable to leather covers:      that of barbers is susceptible to midras uncleanness;     that on which  people eat is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; and that for  [spreading     out] olives is free from all uncleanness.      
mishnah

   . Three different laws are applicable to bases: one which  lies before a bed or before a scrivener     is susceptible to midras  uncleanness; one for a side-board is susceptible to corpse uncleanness;  and one for a cupboard is free from all uncleanness.  
mishnah

   . Three different laws apply to writing tablets: that of  papyrus     is susceptible to midras uncleanness; that which had a  receptacle for wax is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; and that  which is polished is free from all uncleanness.  
mishnah

   . Three different laws apply to beds: one that is used for  lying upon is susceptible to midras uncleanness; one used by glass  makers     is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; and one used by harness  makers is free from all uncleanness.  
mishnah

   . Three different laws apply to refuse baskets: one for  dung     is susceptible to midras uncleanness; one for straw is  susceptible to corpse uncleanness; and a camel's rope bag     is free from  all uncleanness.  
mishnah

     . Three different laws apply to mats: one used for sitting  upon is susceptible to midras uncleanness; one used by dyers     is  susceptible to corpse uncleanness; and one used in wine-presses is free  from all uncleanness.  
mishnah

      three different laws apply to water skins and three  different laws apply to shepherds wallets: those that can hold the  prescribed quantity     are susceptible to midras uncleanness; those  that cannot hold the prescribed quantity are susceptible to corpse  uncleanness; and those made of fish skin are free from all  uncleanness.      
mishnah

     . Three different laws apply to hides: that which is used as  a rug     is susceptible to midras uncleanness; that which is used as a  wrapper for vessels     is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; and that  which is intended for straps and sandals is free from all  uncleanness.      
mishnah

     . Three different laws apply to sheets: one used for lying  upon is susceptible to midras uncleanness; one used as a curtain is  susceptible to corpse uncleanness; and one used as a mural  decoration     is free from all uncleanness.  
mishnah

     . Three different laws apply to napkins: that for the hands  is susceptible to midras uncleanness;     that for books     is susceptible  to corpse uncleanness;     and that which is used as a shroud as well as  that used for the harps of the levites is free from all uncleanness.  
mishnah

     . Three different laws apply to leathern gloves: those  used by the hunters of animals and birds are susceptible to midras  uncleanness; those used by locust-cutters are susceptible to corpse  uncleanness; and those used by fruit-pickers     are free from all  uncleanness.  
mishnah

     . Three different laws apply to headnets: a girl's is  susceptible to midras uncleanness; an old woman's is susceptible to  corpse uncleanness; and a harlot's     is free from all uncleanness.  
mishnah

     . Three different laws apply to store-baskets: if a worn-out  basket is patched on to a sound one,     all is determined by the sound  one;     if a small basket is patched on to a large one     all is determined  by the large one;     if they are equal all is determined by the inner  one.     R. Simeon ruled: if the cup of a balance     was patched on to the  bottom of a boiler on the inside, the latter becomes unclean; but if on  the outside it remains clean. If it was patched on to the side, whet her  on the inside or the outside. The latter remains clean.  
mishnah

   . All vessels are subject   to different laws   in regard to their  outer and inner sides respectively,   as, for instance, cushions, bolsters,  sacks and packing-bags;   so r. Judah. R. Meir ruled: any article that has  hangers   is subject to different laws in its outer and inner sides  respectively,   but one that has no hangers   is not subject to different  laws in regard to outer and inner sides.   A table and a side-board   are  subject to different laws in regard to their outer and inner sides  respectively; so r. Judah. R. Meir ruled: they are not subject to the  lenient law in regard to their outer sides.   The same law also applies  to a rimless tray.  
mishnah

   . An ox-goad     is subject   to different laws   in its outer and  inner parts respectively,   [the former being that section of the shaft  that lies between] seven handbreadths from the broad blade     and  four handbreadths from the point;     so r. Judah. R. Meir ruled: it is not  [subject to such distinction],     the four and the seven handbreadths  having been mentioned only in regard to its remnants.      
mishnah

   . Measures of wine or oil, a soup-ladle, a mustard-strainer  and a wine-filter are subject     to different laws in regard to their  outer and inner sides respectively;     so r. Meir. R. Judah ruled: they are  not [subject to these distinctions].     R. Simeon ruled: they are [subject  to different laws]. For if their outer parts contracted uncleanness  their inner parts remain clean;     though     immersion     is required.  
mishnah

   . If [in a measure consisting of] a quarter [of a log] and half  a quarter [of a log]     the quarter measure contracted uncleanness  the half-quarter measure does not become unclean, and if the half  quarter contracted uncleanness the quarter does not become  unclean. The students argued before r. Akiba:     since the half quarter  measure is the outer part of the quarter measure, should not the  outer side of the vessel whose inner side contracted uncleanness  become unclean? He answered them: does it     then belong to the class  that takes precedence?     It is equally possible that the quarter is to be  regarded as the outer side of the half quarter and, surely, the inner  side of a vessel does not become unclean if the outer side contracted  uncleanness.  
mishnah

   . If the quarter     contracted uncleanness, the quarter and  its outer side are unclean;     but the half quarter and its outer side  remain clean.     If the half quarter contracted uncleanness, the half  quarter and its outer side are unclean,     but the quarter and its outer  side remain clean. If the outer side of the quarter contracted  uncleanness, the outer side of the half quarter remains clean. So r.  Meir. But the sages ruled: the outer side cannot be divided.     When  however immersion is performed     the whole of the vessel must be  immersed.  
mishnah

   . If on the bases, rims, hangers or handles of vessels that  have a receptacle unclean liquid fell one merely dries them and they  remain clean. But [if unclean liquid fell] on a part of any other vessel  (which cannot hold pomegranates)     in which no distinction is made      between its outer and inner sides,     the whole becomes unclean. If the  outer side of a vessel contracted uncleanness from a liquid, only its  outer side is unclean but its inner side, rim, hanger and handles remain  clean. If its inner side contracted uncleanness the whole is unclean.  
mishnah

   . All vessels are     subject to different laws     in regard to  their outer and inner sides respectively     and also in regard to the  part by which they are held.     R. Tarfon ruled: this     applies only to a  large wooden baking trough. R. Akiba ruled: it applies also to cups. R.  Meir ruled: it applies only to unclean and clean     hands. R. Jose stated:  they spoke only of clean hands.      
mishnah

   . In what manner?     If one's hands were clean and the outer  side of a cup was unclean, a man may hold it by its holding-place and  need have no scruples lest his hands have contracted uncleanness  from the outer side of the cup. If     he was drinking from a cup whose  outer side was unclean he need have no scruples lest the liquid in his  mouth contracted uncleanness from the outer side of the cup and  that it then     conveyed uncleanness to the cup. If a kettle     was  boiling one need have no scruples lest liquid should issue from it and  touch its outer side and return again within it.  
mishnah

   . Holy vessels are not subject to different laws     in regard  to their outer and inner sides or in regard to the part by which they  are held,     nor may vessels that are within one another be immersed      if they are to be used for hallowed things.     All vessels become  susceptible to uncleanness by mere intention,     but they cannot be  rendered insusceptible except by a change-effecting act;     for an act      disannuls an earlier act as well as an earlier intention, while an  intention annuls neither an earlier act nor an earlier intention.  
mishnah

   . The sandal of imki   and a laced-up bag   (r. Judah ruled: also  an egyptian basket;   r. Simeon b. Gamaliel ruled: the same law applies  also to a laodicean sandal)   can be made susceptible to uncleanness    and again be made insusceptible   without the aid of a craftsman. Said r.  Jose: ‘but cannot all vessels be made susceptible to uncleanness and  be rendered insusceptible without the aid of a craftsman?   But these,  even when they are unlaced, are susceptible to uncleanness since a  layman is able to restore them’.   They   spoke only of an egyptian  basket   which even a craftsman cannot [easily]   restore.  
mishnah

   . A laced-up bag whose laces were removed     is still  susceptible to uncleanness; but if it was made flat     it becomes  insusceptible to uncleanness. If a strip of lining has been put on it  below,     it remains susceptible. If a bag was within another bag and one  of them contracted uncleanness from a liquid, the other does not  become unclean.     A pearl pouch is susceptible to uncleanness. As to a  money pouch, r. Eliezer rules that it is susceptible to uncleanness, and  the sages rule that it is insusceptible.      
mishnah

   . The hand-cover of thorn-pickers     is insusceptible to  uncleanness.     A belt     and leg guards     are susceptible to  uncleanness. Sleeves     are susceptible to uncleanness but leggings      are not susceptible. Any finger-stall is insusceptible to uncleanness  except that of fruit     -pickers, since the latter holds the sumach  berries.     If it     was torn, it is insusceptible to uncleanness, provided it  cannot hold the greater part of a sumach berry.  
mishnah

   . A sandal     one of whose straps was torn off but was  mended again, retains its midras uncleanness.     If a second strap was  torn off, though it was mended again, it     becomes free from midras  uncleanness but is unclean from contact with midras.     If the second  strap was torn off before the first could be mended, it     becomes  clean.     If its heel was torn off, or if its toe-piece was removed, or if it      was torn in two, it     becomes clean.     A heel-less slipper     that was torn  anywhere becomes clean. A shoe that was damaged becomes clean if it  cannot contain the greater part of the foot. A shoe that is still on the  last, r. Eliezer rules, is insusceptible to uncleanness,     but the sages  rule that it is susceptible. All water skins whose holes     have been tied  up are insusceptible to uncleanness,     except those of the arabs.     R.  Meir rules: if they are tied up for a while, they are clean; but if they  are tied with a permanent knot     they are unclean. R. Jose ruled: all  tied up water skins     are clean.  
mishnah

   . The following hides are susceptible to midras  uncleanness: a hide which is intended for use as a rug,     a hide used as a  tanner's apron, a hide used as the lower covering of a bed, a hide used  as an apron by an ass-driver,     by a flax-worker, by a porter or by a  physician,     a hide used for a cot, a hide put over a child's heart,     a hide  of a cushion or a bolster. All these are susceptible to midras  uncleanness. A hide for wrapping up combed wool and a hide worn by a  wool-comber, r. Eliezer rules, is susceptible to midras, but the sages  rule that it is susceptible to corpse uncleanness only.      
mishnah

   . A bag     or wrapper     for garments is susceptible to midras.  A bag or wrapper for purple wool, beth shammai rule, is susceptible to  midras, but beth hillel rule that     it is only susceptible to corpse  uncleanness.     If a hide is used as a covering for vessels it is not  susceptible to uncleanness, but if it is used as a covering for weights      it is susceptible. R. Jose in the name of his father rules that it is  insusceptible.  
mishnah

   . Whenever no act is lacking     intention     alone     causes an  article to be susceptible to uncleanness, but wherever an act is  lacking     intention     alone does not render it susceptible to  uncleanness, except fur skins.      
mishnah

   . The hides of a householder become susceptible to  uncleanness by intention,     but those that belong to a tanner     do not  become susceptible by mere intention. Those taken by a thief     become  susceptible by intention,     but those taken by a robber     do not become  susceptible by mere intention.     R. Simeon stated: the rule is to be  reversed; those taken by a robber     become susceptible by mere  intention, but those taken by a thief     do not become susceptible by  intention, since in the latter case the owner does not abandon the  hope for recovery.      
mishnah

   . If a hide had contracted midras uncleanness and its owner  then intended it to be used for straps or sandals     it becomes clean as  soon as he put the knife into it; so r. Judah. But the sages ruled: it does  not become clean until he has reduced its size to less than five  handbreadths. R. Eliezer son of r. Zadok ruled: even if one made a  napkin from the hide     it     remains unclean,     but if from a bolster it  becomes clean.      Mishna - mas. Kelim chapter       
mishnah

   . Cloth is susceptible to   five forms   of uncleanness; sacking    is susceptible to   four; leather to   three; wood to two; and an earthen  vessel to one. An earthen vessel   is susceptible to uncleanness [only]  as a receptacle.   Any earthen vessel that has no inner part is not  susceptible to uncleanness from   its outer part.   Wood is subject to an  additional form of uncleanness in that it is also susceptible to  uncleanness   as a seat.   Similarly a tablet which has no rim is  susceptible to uncleanness if it is a wooden object and insusceptible if  it is an earthen one. Leather is susceptible to an additional form of  uncleanness in that it is also susceptible to the uncleanness of ohel.      Sacking has an additional form of uncleanness in that it is susceptible  to uncleanness as woven work.     Cloth has an additional form of  uncleanness in that it is susceptible to uncleanness when it is only  three by three fingerbreadths.      
mishnah

   . Cloth is susceptible to uncleanness of midras when it is      three handbreadths square, and to corpse uncleanness     when it is  three fingerbreadths square.     Sacking when it is four handbreadths  square, leather five handbreadths square and matting six  handbreadths square are equally susceptible to both midras and  corpse uncleanness. R. Meir ruled: what remains of sacking is  susceptible to uncleanness if it is four handbreadths, but when in its  first condition it becomes susceptible only after its manufacture is  completed.  
mishnah

   . If one made up a piece of material from two handbreadths  of cloth and one of sacking, or of three of sacking and one of leather  or four of leather and one of matting, it is not susceptible to  uncleanness.     If, however, the piece of material was made up of five  handbreadths of matting and one of leathers or four of leather and  one of sacking, or three of sacking and one of cloth it is susceptible to  uncleanness. This is the general rule: if the material added is subject  to greater restrictions     it     is susceptible to uncleanness,     but if the  material added was subject to lesser restrictions     it     is not  susceptible.      
mishnah

   . If from any of these     a piece one handbreadth square was  cut off     it is susceptible to uncleanness.     [if a piece] one handbreadth  square     [was cut off] from the bottom of a basket it is susceptible to  uncleanness.     [if it was cut] from the sides of the basket, r. Simeon  rules that it is not susceptible to uncleanness, but the sages rule that  wherever a square handbreadth is cut off     it is susceptible to  uncleanness.  
mishnah

   . Worn-out pieces of a sifter or a sieve that were adapted  for use as a seat, r. Akiba rules are susceptible to uncleanness, but the  sages rule that they are not susceptible unless their rough ends were  cut off.     A child's stool that has legs, even though it is less than a  handbreadth high, is susceptible to uncleanness.     A child's shirt, r.  Eliezer rules, is susceptible to uncleanness however small it may be;  but the sages ruled: it is susceptible only if it is of the prescribed size      and measured when doubled.      
mishnah

   . The following are measured     when doubled:     socks, long  stockings, drawers, a cap and a money-belt. As regards a patch sewn on  the hem,     if it was undoubled     it is measured undoubled,     but if it was  doubled it is measured when doubled.      
mishnah

   . If a piece of cloth was woven to the extent of three  [handbreadths] square, when it contracted midras uncleanness, and  after the entire piece was completed one removed     a single thread  from the original part,     it     is released from midras uncleanness but      is still unclean from contact with midras uncleanness. If a thread was  removed from the original part and then all the cloth was finished,  it     is still unclean from contact with midras uncleanness.  
mishnah

   . Similarly     if a piece of cloth was woven to the extent of  three [finger breadths] square, when it contracted corpse  uncleanness, and after the entire piece was finished one removed     a  single thread from its original part,     it     is released from corpse  uncleanness     but     is still unclean from contact with corpse  uncleanness. If a thread was removed from the original part     and  then all the cloth was finished it remains clean, for the sages have  ruled: if a piece of three [fingerbreadths] square is lessened it becomes  clean,     but if one of three hand breadths square is lessened, even  though it is released from midras, it is still susceptible to all other  forms of uncleanness.  
mishnah

   . If a sheet that had contracted midras uncleanness was  made     into a curtain, it is released from midras uncleanness but is  still unclean from contact with midras uncleanness. Said r. Jose: but  what midras uncleanness has this     touched!     Only if a zab had  touched it     is it unclean from contact with a zab.  
mishnah

     . If a piece of cloth three [handbreadths] square     was  divided,     it is released from the midras uncleanness but is still  unclean from contact with midras uncleanness. Said r. Jose: but what  midras uncleanness has this touched!     Only if a zab had touched it is it  unclean from contact with a zab.  
mishnah

     . If a piece of cloth three [handbreadths] square [was  found] on a rubbish heap it must     be both sound and capable of  wrapping up salt;     but [if it was found] in the house it need only be      either sound or capable of wrapping up salt. How much salt must it be  capable of wrapping up? A quarter of a kab. R. Judah stated: this refers  to fine salt, but the sages stated: it refers to coarse salt. Both  intended to relax the law.     R. Simeon ruled: the law concerning a piece  of cloth three [handbreadths] square on a rubbish heap is the same as  that for a piece of cloth that was three [fingerbreadths] square in a  house.      
mishnah

     . [a piece of cloth] three [handbreadths] square that was  torn     becomes insusceptible to uncleanness if on being put on a stool  one's flesh     would     touch the stool; otherwise it remains susceptible  to uncleanness. [a piece of cloth] three [fingerbreadths] square one  thread of which was worn away, or on which a knot was found, or in  which two threads ran alongside each other, is not susceptible to  uncleanness. [a piece of cloth] three [fingerbreadths] square that was  cast on the rubbish heap becomes insusceptible to uncleanness. If it  was taken back again it becomes susceptible to uncleanness. Throwing  it away invariably renders it insusceptible to uncleanness and taking  it back again renders it susceptible to uncleanness,     except when it is  of purple or fine crimson.     R. Eliezer ruled: a patch of new cloth is also  subject to the same law. R. Simeon ruled: all these materials     become  insusceptible;     and the latter     have been mentioned [as  distinguishable from others] only in connection with the return of  lost property.      
mishnah

   . [a piece of cloth] three [fingerbreadths] square that   was  stuffed into a ball or was itself made into a ball becomes clean.   But  [a piece of cloth] three [handbreadths] square that   was stuffed into a  ball remains unclean.   If the latter   was itself made into a ball it  becomes clean   because the sewing reduces its size.  
mishnah

   . [a piece of cloth] less than three [handbreadths] square  that was adapted for the purpose of stopping up a hole in a bath house,    of emptying a cooking-pot   or of wiping with it the mill stones, whether  it was or was not kept in readiness for any such use,   is susceptible to  uncleanness; so r. Eliezer. R. Joshua ruled: whether it was or was not  kept in readiness it is not susceptible to uncleanness. R. Akiba ruled: if  it was kept in readiness it is susceptible, and if it was not kept in  readiness it is not susceptible.  
mishnah

   . If a plaster is made of cloth or leather it is not susceptible  to uncleanness.   A     poultice is insusceptible to uncleanness if it is on  cloth,     but if on leather it is susceptible.     Rabban simeon b. Gamaliel  ruled: even if it was on cloth the latter remain susceptible to  uncleanness because the former     can be shaken off.      
mishnah

   . Scroll wrappers, whether they are ornamented with  [embroidered] figures or not, are susceptible to uncleanness  according to the view of beth shammai. Beth hillel ruled: those that  are ornamented with figures are insusceptible to uncleanness,     but  those that are not ornamented are susceptible. Rabban gamaliel  ruled: both the former and the latter are insusceptible.  
mishnah

   . If a head-wrap that     had contracted midras uncleanness  was wrapped around a scroll, it is released from midras uncleanness      but remains susceptible to corpse uncleanness. A skin     that was made  into a rug     or a leather rug that was made into a skin     becomes  clean.     A skin     that was made into a [shepherd's] wallet or a  [shepherd's] wallet that was made into a skin; or a cushion cover that  was made into a sheet or a sheet that was made into a cushion cover;  or a bolster cover that was made into a plain sheet or a plain sheet  that was made into a bolster cover, remains unclean. This is the  general rule: any object that has been changed into one of the same  class     remains unclean, but if into one of another class it becomes  clean.  
mishnah

   . If a patch     was sewn on to a basket,     the latter      conveys     one grade of uncleanness     and     one of unfitness.     If it was  severed from the basket, the latter conveys one grade of uncleanness  and one of unfitness, but the patch     becomes clean.     If it was sewn on  to cloth     the latter     conveys two grades of uncleanness     and one of  unfitness.     If it was severed from the cloth, the latter     conveys     one  grade of uncleanness     and     one of unfitness, while the patch conveys  two grades of uncleanness and one of unfitness.     The same law      applies also where a patch was sewn on to sacking or leather; so r.  Meir. R. Simeon rules that they     are clean.     R. Jose ruled: if it was sewn  on leather it becomes clean; but if on sacking it remains unclean, since  the latter is a woven material.      
mishnah

   . The prescribed minimum of three (fingerbreadths] square  of which they have spoken     is exclusive of the hem; so r. Simeon. But the  sages ruled: exactly three [fingerbreadths] square.     If a patch     was  sewn on to a cloth by one side only,     it cannot be regarded as a  connective.     If it was sewn on by two opposite sides, it is a connective.      If it was sewn on the shape of a gamma,     r. Akiba rules that the cloth is  unclean, but the sages rule that it is clean. R. Judah stated: this      applies only to a cloak,     but in the case of a shirt     the patch is  regarded as a connective if it was sewn on only by its upper side,     but  if by its lower side it is no connective.      
mishnah

   . Poor men's clothes, though made up of pieces none of which  measures three [fingerbreadths] square are susceptible to midras  uncleanness,     if a cloak began to be torn, as soon as its greater part is  affected [the fragments] are not regarded as joined.     Exceptionally  thick or thin materials     are not governed by the prescribed minimum  of three [fingerbreadths] square.      
mishnah

   . A porter's pad     is susceptible to midras uncleanness. A wine  filter     is not susceptible to uncleanness as a seat.     An old woman's  hair-net     is susceptible to uncleanness as a seat.     A harlot's shirt  which is woven like net work is not susceptible to uncleanness.     A  garment made of a fishing net is not susceptible to uncleanness;     but  one made of its net work bag is susceptible. R. Eliezer b. Jacob ruled:  even if a garment is made out of a fishing net but is made double it is  susceptible to uncleanness.      
mishnah

     . A hair-net that one began to make from its hem remains  insusceptible to uncleanness until its bottom section is finished; and if  one began from its bottom section, it remains insusceptible to  uncleanness until its hem is finished. Its head band is susceptible to  uncleanness in itself.     Its strings are susceptible to uncleanness as  connectives.     A hair-net that is torn becomes insusceptible to  uncleanness if it cannot contain the greater part of the hair.  Mishna - mas. Kelim chapter       
mishnah

   . The fringes   of a sheet, a scarf, a head-wrap and a felt cap  are regarded as connectives   up to a length of six fingerbreadths;    those of an undergarment up to ten [fingerbreadths]. The fringes of a  thick cloak, a veil, a shirt, or a light cloak are regarded as  connectives up to a length of three fingerbreadths. The fringes   of an  old woman's head-wrap, of the face wraps of the arabs, of the cilician  goat's-hair cloth, of a money-belt, of a turban or of a curtain are  regarded as connectives whatsoever their length may be.  
mishnah

   . Three woollen bolster-covers,   six linen ones,   three  sheets,   twelve handkerchiefs,   two arm-cloths,   one shirt,   one cloak,    or one winter-cloak,   are regarded as connectives in respect of both  uncleanness   and sprinkling.   If they exceed this number they are  regarded as connectives in respect of uncleanness   but not in respect  of sprinkling.   R. Jose ruled, not even in respect of uncleanness.    
mishnah

   . The cord of [the common] plummet     is regarded as a  connective     up to a length of twelve [cubits];     that of the carpenters’  plummet, up to eighteen [cubits];     and that of the builders’ plummet      up to fifty cubits. The parts that exceed these lengths, even if it was  desired to retain them,     remain insusceptible to uncleanness.     The  cord of the plummet of plasterers or moulders is regarded as a  connective whatsoever its length.  
mishnah

   . The cord of the balances of goldsmiths     or the weighers  of fine purple is regarded as a connective up to a length of three  fingerbreadths,     the shaft of an axe behind the grip, up to a length of  three fingerbreadths.     R. Jose ruled: if the length behind the grip is no  less than one handbreadth the entire shaft is unsusceptible to  uncleanness.      
mishnah

   . The cord of the balances of shopkeepers     or householders  is regarded as a connective up to a length of one handbreadth;     the  shaft of an axe in front of the grip, up to one handbreadth; the  projection     of the shaft of a pair of compasses, up to one handbreadth;  that of the shaft of the stone-masons’ chisel, one handbreadth.  
mishnah

   . The cord of the balances of wool dealers     or of  glass-weighers is regarded as a connective up to a length of two  handbreadths; the shaft of a millstone chisel, up to a length of two  handbreadths; the shaft of the battle-axe of the legions, up to a  length of two handbreadths; the shaft of the goldsmiths’ hammer, up  to a length of two handbreadths; and that of the blacksmiths’  hammer, up to three handbreadths.  
mishnah

   . The remnant of the shaft of an ox-goad     at its upper end      is regarded as a connective to a length of four [handbreadths];     the  shaft of a spade, to a length of four [handbreadths]; the shaft of a  weeding-spade, to five handbreadths; the shaft of a small hammer, to  five handbreadths; that of a common hammer, to six handbreadths; the  shaft of an axe used for splitting wood or of one used for digging, to  six [handbreadths]; and the shaft of the stone-trimmers’ axe, up to six  handbreadths.  
mishnah

   . The remnant of the shaft of an ox-goad     at its lower end      is regarded as a connective to a length of seven handbreadths; the  shaft of the trowel of householders — beth shammai ruled: to a  length of seven [handbreadths], and beth hillel ruled: to one of eight  [handbreadths]; that of the plasterers — beth shammai ruled: nine  [handbreadths] and beth hillel ruled: ten [handbreadths]. Any parts  exceeding these lengths, if it was desired to retain it, is also  susceptible to uncleanness.     The shafts of fire instruments     are  susceptible to uncleanness whatsoever their length.  
mishnah

   . Among glass-ware those that are flat are not susceptible to  uncleanness and those that form receptacles are susceptible.   After  they are broken they become clean;   and if one again made utensils of  them they become henceforth susceptible to uncleanness. A glass tray  or a flat dish is not susceptible to uncleanness. If they have a rim they  are susceptible. The concave bottom of a glass   bowl or plate   which  was adapted for use remains insusceptible to uncleanness.   If they  were polished or scraped with a file they become susceptible to  uncleanness.    
mishnah

   . A mirror is insusceptible to uncleanness. A tray   that was  made into a mirror remains susceptible, but if it was originally made  to serve as a mirror   it is insusceptible.   A spoon   that is laid on a table  is susceptible to uncleanness if it can hold anything whatsoever; but  if it cannot do so,   r. Akiba rules that it is susceptible,     and r. Johanan  b. Nuri rules that it is insusceptible.      
mishnah

   . A cup   the greater part of which is broken off is  insusceptible to uncleanness. If it was broken in three places      extending over its greater part it is also insusceptible to uncleanness.  R. Simeon ruled: if it lets the greater part of the water leak out it is  insusceptible to uncleanness. If a hole appeared in it and it was mended  with tin or pitch it is still insusceptible to uncleanness.     R. Jose ruled:  if with tin it is susceptible to uncleanness,     but if with pitch it is  insusceptible.  
mishnah

   . A small flask whose neck     was removed remains  susceptible to uncleanness,     but a large one whose neck was removed  becomes insusceptible.     One of spikenard oil whose neck     was removed  becomes insusceptible to uncleanness, since it     scratches the hand.  Large flagons     whose necks were removed remain susceptible to  uncleanness, since they are adapted for the use of holding pickled  foodstuffs. A glass mill-funnel is clean.     R. Jose observed: ‘blessed art  thou, o kelim; for, though thou didst enter with uncleanness,     thou  art gone forth in cleanness’.
