Kelim, Chapter Twenty-Six, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two 
A laced-up bag whose laces were removed is still susceptible to uncleanness; 
But if it was made flat it is pure. 
If a strip of cloth has been put on it below, it is susceptible. 
If a bag was within another bag and one of them became unclean from a liquid, the other does not become unclean.     
A pearl pouch is susceptible to uncleanness. 
A money pouch: 
Rabbi Eliezer says that it is susceptible to uncleanness, 
But the sages say that it is pure.

Explanation
Section one: If the laces from a lace-bag are completely removed, it is still susceptible to impurity. It only becomes pure if it is flattened out such that it does not have a receptacle (see yesterday's mishnah).
Section two: By taking a strip of cloth and sewing it below the lace-bag he changes the lace-bag into a regular pouch without laces. If he does so, it has a receptacle and it is susceptible to impurity. 
Section three: In this case the rabbis were lenient because liquids defile vessels only "derabbanan"â€”from rabbinic decree. According to Torah law, liquids cannot convey impurity to vessels. Therefore, if one bag was inside another bag and one bag came into contact with an unclean liquid, only that bag is defiled. The other bag remains pure.
Section four: A pearl pouch is a small piece of leather sewed up to protect a pearl. It is susceptible to impurity.
Section five: Rabbi Eliezer says that a money pouch is susceptible in the same way that a pearl pouch is. Both have receptacles, and therefore both can become impure. The sages disagree. A money pouch is opened frequently and when it is opened it no longer has a receptacle. Since it is so frequently found in its "simple" state, without a receptacle, it is considered a "simple" vessel and is not susceptible.
