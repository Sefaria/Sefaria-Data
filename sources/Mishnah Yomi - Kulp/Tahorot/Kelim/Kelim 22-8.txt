Kelim, Chapter Twenty-Two, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight 
A chest whose top part was removed is still susceptible to uncleanness on account of its bottom; 
If its bottom was removed it is still susceptible to uncleanness on account of its top part.     
If both the top part and the bottom part were removed: 
Rabbi Judah says that it is susceptible to uncleanness on account of its sides,     
But the sages rule that it is clean. 
A stonecutter's seat is subject to midras uncleanness.

Explanation
Section one: The type of chest referred to here seems to contain some drawers. If the top part is removed, the whole chest is still susceptible to impurity on account of the bottom part. Similarly, if the bottom part is removed, the whole chest is susceptible to impurity on account of the top part.
Section two: According to Rabbi Judah, if both the bottom and top part are removed, the chest is still susceptible to impurity on account of its sides. However, the sages rule that such a chest is no longer usable and is therefore clean.
Section three: A stonecutter's seat is a temporary seat that a stonecutter will fashion for him to use while performing his work. The seat is considered to be a real seat and is therefore susceptible to midras impurity.
