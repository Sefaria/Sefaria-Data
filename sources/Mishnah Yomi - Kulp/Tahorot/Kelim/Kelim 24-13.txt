Kelim, Chapter Twenty-Four, Mishnah Thirteen

Mishnah Thirteen
There are three different types of sheets: 
One used for lying upon is susceptible to midras uncleanness; 
One used as a curtain is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; 
And one used as a mural decoration is free from all uncleanness.

Explanation
I think by now the principles underlying this mishnah should be clear.
