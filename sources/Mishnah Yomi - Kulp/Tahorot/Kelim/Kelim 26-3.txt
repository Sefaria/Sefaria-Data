Kelim, Chapter Twenty-Six, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Today's mishnah deals with various types of protective clothing worn by fruit-pickers. 

Mishnah Three
The hand-coverings of thorn-pickers are pure.     
A belt and leg guards are susceptible to uncleanness. 
Sleeves are susceptible to uncleanness. 
But hand-coverings are pure. 
All finger-coverings are pure except that of fig-pickers, since the latter holds the sumac berries.     
If it was torn, if it cannot hold the greater part of a sumac berry it is pure. 

Explanation
Section one: The hand-coverings used by thorn-pickers are simple pieces of leather, not fashioned fully into gloves. Since they do not have a receptacle, they are pure.
Section two: However, their belt or leg-guards are susceptible either because they do have receptacles or because they are considered to be vessels. 
Section three: The sleeves referred to here are not attached to a shirt, but are independent. They are susceptible for they are considered vessels, even though they don't have a receptacle. 
Section four: But hand-coverings (these are different from those mentioned in section one) are not susceptible.
Section five: Fruit-pickers would use finger-coverings to protect their fingers while harvesting the fruit. Generally these finger-coverings are simple pieces of leather and are pure. The exception is the finger-coverings used by fig-pickers for they would use these finger-coverings to hold sumac berries.
If the fig-pickers finger-coverings were torn, they could no longer hold berries and they would be pure.
