Kelim, Chapter Twenty-Four, Mishnah Fifteen

Mishnah Fifteen
There are three different types of hip-boots: 
Those used by the hunters of animals and birds are susceptible to midras uncleanness;
Those used by locust gatherers are susceptible to corpse uncleanness.
And those used by fig-pickers are free from all uncleanness.  

Explanation
The word which I have translated "hip-boots" is based on Albeck's explanation of this mishnah. Traditional commentators explain the word to mean some sort of leather gloves. 
Section one: According to Albeck, when hunters wear these boots, they cover all the way down to the foot. Since they are walked upon, they are susceptible to midras.
Section two: The hip-boots used by locust gatherers are considered vessels, but they do not cover the feet. Therefore, they are not susceptible to midras. Note that in the time of the mishnah Jews would have eaten locusts. Today very few Jews do so, although certain locusts are still considered kosher.
Section three: The hip-boots used by fig-pickers are not considered vessels at all.
