Kelim, Chapter Twenty-Nine, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with how much of a vessel is regarded as connected to the vessel.

Mishnah Five
The cord of the balances of shopkeepers or householders is regarded as connected up to a length of one handbreadth.
The shaft of an axe in front of the grip, up to one handbreadth.
The projection of the shaft of a compass, up to one handbreadth.
That of the shaft of the stone-masonsâ€™ chisel, one handbreadth. 

Explanation
Section one: These cords are regarded as connected for a greater length than those mentioned in mishnah four, assumedly because a longer cord is needed to weigh heavier material. Gold and purple cloth, the topic of yesterday's mishnah, are expensive and therefore smaller amounts will be measured.
Section two: This is the part of the axe that is used, as opposed to yesterday's mishnah which referred to the back part which is not used. Therefore, the connected part is longer.
Section three: I must admit that I don't have a clear picture of how their compass looked. In any case, this part of the compass is considered attached up to a length of one handbreadth.
Section four: This handle is also considered connected up to a length of one handbreadth.
