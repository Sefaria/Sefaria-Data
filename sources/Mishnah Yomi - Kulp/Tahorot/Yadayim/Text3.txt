Yadayim, Chapter Four, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight
A Galilean min said: I complain against you Pharisees,that you write the name of the ruler and the name of Moses together on a divorce document.   
The Pharisees said: we complain against you, Galilean min, that you write the name of the ruler together with the divine name on a single page? 
And furthermore that you write the name of the ruler above and the divine name below? As it is said, "And Pharoah said, Who is the lord that I should hearken to his voice to let Israel go?" (Exodus 5:2) But when he was smitten what did he say? The Lord is righteous" (Exodus 9:27).
