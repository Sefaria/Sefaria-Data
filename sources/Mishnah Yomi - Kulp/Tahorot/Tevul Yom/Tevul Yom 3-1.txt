Tevul Yom, Chapter Three, Mishnah One

Mishnah One
	•	Handles to food, which count as connectives when touched by a "father of uncleanness," also count as connectives when touched by a tevul yom. 
	•	If a food was divided into two yet a small part was still attached:
	•	Rabbi Meir says: if one takes hold of the larger part and the smaller part is pulled away with it, behold it is like it.  
	•	Rabbi Judah says: if one takes hold of the smaller part and the greater is also pulled away with it, then behold it is like it. 
	•	Rabbi Nehemiah says: [this refers] to the case of the clean portion.
	•	But the sages say: [it refers] to the unclean portion.  
	•	In the case of all other foods, those usually held by the leaf should be taken by the leaf, and those usually held by the stalk should be taken by the stalk.   

Explanation
Section one: The mishnah refers here to food that is picked up by using a "handle," a piece of the food. We will explain this more when we learn Tractate Oktzin 1:3. If this part is touched by a "father of uncleanness" the entire piece of food is defiled. Similarly, if the food was touched by a tevul yom, the entire thing is defiled. 
Section two: The mishnah now begins to discuss pieces of food that have been broken into two, and yet are still slightly connected. The question is—if one touches part of the disconnected piece, is the entire thing defiled?
Rabbi Meir says that for the two parts to be connected all that must occur is that the smaller part would be picked up with the larger part. This would mean that it would be quite to consider the two parts connected.
Rabbi Judah rules more leniently. Unless the larger part can be lifted with the smaller part, then the two are not considered connected.
Section three: Rabbi Nehemiah and the sages say that it doesn't matter which part is large or small, what matters is which part was pure and which part was impure. According to Rabbi Nehemiah, we examine the part not touched by the tevul yom. If a person picks up the pure part and the impure part that was touched by the tevul yom comes up with it, it is considered connected. . 
According to the sages, we examine the part that was touched by the tevul yom. If when one picks up the impure part the pure part comes up with it, then it too is impure. 
Section four: For other types of food, such as vegetables and fruit, the test is performed by holding the part usually held. If the vegetable/fruit is usually held by the leaf then if he picks it up by the leaf and the vegetable/fruit is lifted up as well, then it is all connected. The same is true if the fruit is usually held by the stalk.
