Tevul Yom, Chapter Two, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
	•	If a jug had a hole either at its neck, bottom or sides, and a tevul yom touched it [at the hole], it becomes unclean.   
	•	Rabbi Judah says: if the hole is at its neck or bottom it becomes unclean; but if on its sides, on this side or on that, it remains clean.   
	•	If one poured [liquid] from one vessel into another, and a tevul yom touched the stream, and there was something within the vessel, then [whatsoever he touches] is neutralized in a hundred and one.

Explanation
Section one: The jug has in it terumah wine and is sealed from above, but there is a hole elsewhere on the jug. According to the first opinion, no matter where that hole is, if a tevul yom touches the hole, all of the contents are disqualified.
Rabbi Judah says that the contents are disqualified only if he touches either the hole on the top, at its neck, or the whole at the bottom. If he touches the hole at the top, all of the wine below is a base for the upper wine, so it is all considered connected. And if he touches the hole on the bottom of the jug then all of the wine will flow out of the hole below, so all of the wine is connected. But if he touches on one of the sides, the rest of the wine remains pure. Only the wine on the side he touches is disqualified. However, if there is a ratio of 100 parts pure wine to 1 part disqualified wine, then the disqualified wine is nullified and it is all pure, as we will learn in section two.  
Section two: If the tevul yom touches the stream flowing from one vessel to the other, he only disqualifies that part that he touches. If there is a 100 to 1 ratio of pure to disqualified liquid, then the part he touched is nullified and it is all pure. This is a similar situation to that in section one.
