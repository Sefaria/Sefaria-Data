Tevul Yom, Chapter Three, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
	•	The streak of an egg that had become congealed on the side of a pan and a tevul yom touched it:
	•	If within the rim [of the pan] it serves as a connective;   
	•	But if outside the rim, it does not serve as a connective. 
	•	Rabbi Yose says that the streak and the part that can be peeled away with it [serves as a connective].   
	•	The same applies to beans that had congealed on the rim of the pot.

Explanation
Section one: The streak of an egg is the white of an egg that trailed behind when cracking the egg. It is congealed on the side of a pan and a tevul yom touches it. If he touches the streak that is in the pot, then all of the contents in the pot are disqualified (if they are of terumah). But if the streak is outside the pot, the contents of the pot remain pure.
Section two: Rabbi Yose says that if the tevul yom touched the streak within the pot, only the parts of the dish that would be picked up with the streak are disqualified. The rest is not considered connected. And if the tevul yom touches the streak outside of the pot, it is never considered connected.
Section three: Beans congealed on the rim of the pot have the same rule as does the streak of egg.
