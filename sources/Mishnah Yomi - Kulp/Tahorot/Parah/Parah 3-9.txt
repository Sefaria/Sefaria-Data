Parah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Nine

Mishnah Nine
They bound it with a rope of reed and placed it on the pile with its head towards the south and its face towards the west. 
The priest stood in the east with his face towards the west. 
He slaughtered with his right hand and received the blood with his left. 
Rabbi Judah said: he received the blood with his right hand and put it in his left hand.
He sprinkled with his right. 
Seven times he dipped his finger in the blood and sprinkled it towards the Holy of Holies, dipping once again for each sprinkling. 
When he finished the sprinkling he wiped his hand on the body of the cow, came down and kindled the fire with wood chips. 
Rabbi Akiva said: with dry branches of palm-trees.

Explanation
Section one: The cow is now bound up and placed on the pile of wood. Its head is facing south and its face is to be turned to the west, towards the Temple.
Section two: The priest stands on the eastern side of the cow, facing the Temple as well.
He slaughters the animal with his right hand and then receives the blood into a vessel held in his left. Rabbi Judah says he receives the blood with his right hand and then puts the vessel into his left. This seems to be a preference for doing the important actions, which include the receiving of the blood, with his right hand.
Section three: He sprinkles the blood 7 times towards the Holy of Holies. This is stated explicitly in Numbers 19:4. 
Section four: He needs to clean off his bloody hand on the cow itself so that the blood can be burned with the fire. Numbers 19:5 specifically states that the blood must be burned.
