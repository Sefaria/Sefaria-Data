Parah, Chapter Five, Mishnah Nine


Mishnah Nine
If one placed two stones close to one another and made them into a trough, and so also in the case of two kneading troughs, and so also in the case of a trough that was split, the water between them is not deemed to be prepared. 
If they were joined together with lime or gypsum and they can be moved together, the water between them is deemed to have been prepared.

Explanation
Section one: Someone takes two stones and sets them up next to each other such that there is a receptacle in between. Or he does the same thing with two kneading troughs or he takes one trough set into a stone and divides it in two. In all three of these cases the water between the two vessels, or in the crack between the split trough, is not considered to be in a vessel and therefore cannot be used for the red cow ritual. In other words, if one takes two vessels and puts them next to each other such that a container is formed in between them, the container is not considered to be a vessel.
Section two: However, if he joins the two troughs together such that they can be moved together, then the container formed in between them counts as a vessel and water in it can be used for the red cow ritual.
