Parah, Chapter Twelve, Mishnah One

Introduction
Today's mishnah deals with the use of hyssop that is too short to dip into the flask with the hatat waters. 

Mishnah One
Hyssop that is too short may be lengthened with a thread and a spindle-reed. 
He then dips it and brings it up again.
He grasps the hyssop itself and sprinkles with it. 
Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Shimon say: just as the sprinkling must be done with the hyssop itself so to must the dipping be done with the hyssop itself. 

Explanation
Section one: It is permitted to lengthen the hyssop by attaching or a spindle-reed onto the end of the hyssop. 
Section two: He can then dip it by holding onto the string and dipping it into the waters.
Section three: However, when he sprinkles onto the impure person, he must grasp the hyssop and not the string. 
Section four:  Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Shimon disagree with the notion that one can extend the length of the hyssop. He must hold the hyssop itself when dipping it into the flask, just as he must hold it when sprinkling.
