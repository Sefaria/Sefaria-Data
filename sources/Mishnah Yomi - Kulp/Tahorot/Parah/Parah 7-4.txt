Parah, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Beware! This mishnah might be a bit confusing, but it should all work out in the end. A classic example of rabbinic conundrums!

Mishnah Four
[If one said to another] "Prepare the mixture for me and I will prepare the one for you," the first is valid. 
[If he said,] "Fill the water for me and I will fill the water for you," that of the latter is valid. 
[If he said,] "Prepare the mixture for me and I will draw the water for you," both mixtures are valid. 
[If he said,] "Fill the water for me and I will prepare the mixture for youâ€™, both mixtures are invalid.

Explanation
Section one: Two people drew water to use it for that hatat. Then one said to the other, "You mix the ashes for me and I will mix for you." The first mixture is valid but the second mixture is not because the second person was occupied with mixing the first person's ash and water between his filling his water and its being mixed with ash. 
Section two: The second filling is valid, but the first filling is invalid for the owner of the water was occupied with filling the other person's water between his own water being filled and their mixing. 
Section three: The first mixture is valid for the owner didn't draw the water for the second person until his mixture was already prepared. And the drawing of water for the second guy only began after the first mixture was already prepared, so it too is valid.
Section four: In this case both are invalid. The first mixture is invalid for the owner of the first water prepared the second person's mixture between the filling of his own water and their mixture. The second mixture is invalid for the second person was occupied with drawing water for the first person between the drawing of his own water and their mixture.
