Parah, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Today's mishnah describes situations where a person prepares the mixture of hatat ash and water and at the same time performs another act, and yet the mixture is still valid. 

Mishnah Three
One who prepared the mixture with one hand and did some other work with the other hand, the mixture is invalid if he prepared it for himself, but if he prepared it for another man, it is valid. 
If he prepared a mixture both for himself and for another man, his is invalid and that of the other man is valid. 
If he prepares mixtures for two men simultaneously, both are valid.

Explanation
Section one: Performing work while mixing the ash and water doesn't disqualify the mixture if the preparation is being made for another person, as we saw in mishnah one. However, if he makes it for himself, it is invalid.
Section two: The same principle is operative hereâ€”he invalidates his own mixture because he is engaged in some other work, but he doesn't invalidate that of the other person.
Section three: Since none of the preparations were being made for himself, both are valid.
