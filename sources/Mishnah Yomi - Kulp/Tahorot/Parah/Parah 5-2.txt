Parah, Chapter Five, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
If one immersed a vessel for the hatat in water that is not fit for the mixing he must dry it; 
If in water that is fit for the mixing he need not dry it.
But if [he intended] to collect in it water that was already mixed with the ashes, he must dry it in either case.  

Explanation
Section one: The water used to mix in the ashes must be fresh water (see 19:17), water that has not been previously collected. If he takes a vessel that can be purified in a mikveh to use it for mixing in the hatat ash and he immerses it in a mikveh, he must make sure that it is completely dry before he puts in the water for the ritual. But if he immersed it in fresh water, he doesn't need to dry it because that water is fit in any case.
Section two: If he immersed the vessel to gather water in which the ashes had already been mixed, then he needs to dry it no matter where he immersed it. This is because he needs to prevent water that has not been sanctified with the hatat (the water in which he immerses) with the water that has already been mixed.
