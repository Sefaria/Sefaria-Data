Parah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Nine

Mishnah Nine
If valid ashes were put on water that was unfit for the preparation, [the latter] defiles one that is clean for terumah [by contact] with his hands or with his body, 
But to one who is clean for the hatat it conveys uncleanness neither [by contact] with his hands nor with his body. 

Explanation
Section one: Since the water was unfit for use in the red cow ritual (assumedly because it is not living waters) it cannot be used for the sprinkling. Nevertheless the water does defile one who has purified himself in order to eat terumah. This is the same rule as we saw in yesterday's mishnah with regard to disqualified hatat waters. 
Section two: This is also the same as the rule we saw in yesterday's mishnah.
