Parah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
One who mixes the water in a trough while a bucket was in it, even though its neck was narrow as can be, the waters in it are prepared. 
If there was a sponge in the trough, the water in it is invalid. 
What should he do? He should empty out the water until he gets to the sponge.
If one touched the sponge, however much the water that washes over it, the water becomes invalid.  

Explanation
Section one: If there is a bucket in the trough when he adds in the hatat ashes, the water in the bucket is also prepared for the sake of sprinkling. The bucket is a vessel and the water in it is considered to be connected to the rest of the water in the trough.
Section two: However, if there is a sponge in the trough, the water in the sponge is not valid for use because the sponge is not a vessel. Furthermore, the water in it is not considered to be connected to the water in the trough. This prevents the rest of the water in the trough from being immediately invalidated.
Section three: This section explains how he should avoid the problem of invalid water from the sponge spilling into the valid water that remains in the trough. What he should do is pour all of the water into another container, thereby preserving its validity. He can then remove the sponge.
Section four: However, if he touches the sponge at all, we must be concerned lest some got squeezed out into the other water and therefore all of the water would be invalid.
