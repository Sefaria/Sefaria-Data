Parah, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
Any derived uncleanness does not defile vessels, but [it does defile] a liquid. 
If a liquid became unclean it defiles them. 
Behold [the vessel] would say [to the liquid], "That which defiled you did not defile me, but you did defile me. 

Explanation
Section one: A derived uncleanness is one that is of either first or second degree uncleanness, meaning it had contact with something that was either a father of uncleanness or had first degree uncleanness. This level of uncleanness defiles liquids but not vessels. 
Section two: The liquid will then defile the vessel, because liquids convey uncleanness to vessels.
Section three: This again creates the paradox. The derived uncleanness was not strong enough to defile the vessel, but that which it defiled (the liquid) was strong enough to do so. The vessel is not happy with that liquid, and it lets it know!
