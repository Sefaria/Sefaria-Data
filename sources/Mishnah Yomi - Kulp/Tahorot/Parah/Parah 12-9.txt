Parah, Chapter Twelve, Mishnah Nine

Mishnah Nine
The baskets of a pack-saddle, the bed of a barrow, the iron corner of a bier, the [drinking] horns of travelers, a key chain, the loose stitches of washermen, and a garment stitched together with kilayim are regarded as connected in respect of uncleanness but not in that of sprinkling.

Explanation
There are many items mentioned in this mishnah. I shall attempt to explain them one at a time, based on Albeck's interpretation.
The baskets of a pack-saddle:  A saddle made of wood placed on a donkey. There are baskets attached to both sides.
The bed of a barrow: a vessel used for threshing produce.  
The corner of a bier: The head of a long bier for carrying a body or some sort of seat.   
The [drinking] horns of travelers: A vessel used by travelers to draw and store water. 
A key chain: Same thing you and I still use to this day! 
The loose stitches of laundry men: Washers loosely stitch clothing together while washing so that it doesn't get lost.    
And a garment stitched together with kilayim: Kilayim are mixed kinds. Someone stitched together a garment of flax using wool or vice versa. These stitches will have to be removed.
All of these vessels are regarded as connected when it comes to the regular laws of purity. If one part is defiled, the other part is defiled as well.
However, the laws of sprinkling are more stringent. These things are not considered to be connected. Therefore, if one sprinkles on one, the other part is not yet clean.
