Parah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Our mishnah teaches that if one causes water to pass from a spring into a jar by using a conduit that is receptive to impurity, the water is invalid. The water must either be filled straight into the jar, or at least go through or over something that does not receive impurity. 

Mishnah Four 
If he placed his hand or his foot or leaves of vegetables in such a manner as to enable the water to run into a jar, the water is invalid. 
If he used leaves of reeds or leaves of nuts the water is valid. 
This is the general rule: [water passing over] that which is susceptible to uncleanness is invalid, but [water passing over] that which is not susceptible to uncleanness is valid.  

Explanation
Section one: Hands, feet and leaves of vegetables are susceptible to impurity. Therefore, the water that has passed over them has been invalidated.  
Section two: However, leaves of reeds or nuts are not susceptible to impurity, therefore, the water remains valid for use.
Section three: This is the general rule that explains the distinction between section one and two.
