Parah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Three

Introduction
If a living creature drinks from the red cow waters we must be concerned lest the creature backwashed into the water, thereby disqualifying it. Our mishnah deals with which animals backwash and which sip without doing so. 

Mishnah Three
If a domesticated beast or a wild animal drank from it, it becomes invalid. 
All birds cause invalidity, except the dove since it only sucks up the water. 
All creeping things do not cause invalidity, except the weasel since it laps up the water. 
Rabban Gamaliel ruled: the snake also because it vomits. 
Rabbi Eliezer ruled: the mouse also. 

Explanation
Section one: Domesticated beasts (cows, goats and sheep) and wild animals are all considered to be backwashers. So if they drink from the red cow waters, the waters can't be used because they are now mixed with the animal's spittle.
Section two: Birds are also backwashers, except for the dove, whose spit doesn't go into the water. Remind me next time I want to share a drink, to only do so with doves!
Section three: Creeping things don't generally backwash when drinking. The weasel, however, laps up the water and therefore if it drinks from the red cow waters, they are invalidated.
Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer add the mouse and snake to the list.
