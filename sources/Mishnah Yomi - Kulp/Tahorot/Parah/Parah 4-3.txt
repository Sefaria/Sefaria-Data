Parah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
If he burned it without wood, or with any kind of wood, and even if only with straw or stubble, it is valid. 
If he flayed it and cut up, it is valid. 
If he slaughtered it with the intention of eating its flesh or drinking its blood, it is valid. 
Rabbi Eliezer rules: no intention can invalidate the red cow.

Explanation
Section one: Although the type of wood that should be used to burn the red cow is listed in 3:8, if he uses other wood, or even no wood at all, the act is still valid. It seems that the wood is not part of the mitzvah, but just something that enables the mitzvah and therefore using different material does not invalidate the mitzvah.
Section two: The act is valid even if the cow is flayed and cut up before being burned. Of course, all of the cow must be burned.
Section three: The printed version reads "valid" but this seems to be an erroneous reading. Manuscripts and testimony from medieval commentaries read "invalid" which makes more sense. If he slaughters the red cow with the intention of eating its flesh or drinking its blood, he has invalidated it. 
Rabbi Eliezer is consistent with his position in mishnah oneâ€”wrong intentions do not invalidate the red cow ritual since it is not considered to be a sacrifice.
