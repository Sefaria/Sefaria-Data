Parah, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Five

Introduction
In yesterday's mishnah we learned some purity rules concerning a person whom the Torah mandated to immerse in mikveh. Today's mishnah contrasts this with a person whom the sages required to immerse in a mikveh. This would include a person who ate impure foods or drank impure liquids [we will learn more about this category in Tractate Zavim]. 

Mishnah Five
All that require immersion in water according to the words of the scribes defile consecrated things and invalidate terumah to be unfit, but they are permitted to unconsecrated food and second tithe, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
But the sages forbid second tithe. 
After immersion [but before the sun sets] he is permitted to all these. 
And if he entered the sanctuary, whether before or after his immersion, he incurs no guilt.

Explanation
Section one: As was the case in yesterday's mishnah, he still defiles holy food and invalidates terumah, even though he was required only by rabbinic law to immerse in the mikveh. But there are no restrictions with regard to hullin (unconsecrated food) and second tithe. 
The other sages slightly disagree. They hold that he is still forbidden to eat second tithe, although he doesn't cause it to become impure. 
Section two: There are no restrictions after he has immersed. Since he was only required by rabbinic law ("the words of the scribes") to enter a mikveh, he need not wait for the sun to set to become completely pure and permitted to eat and touch anything. In addition, he is not liable at all if he enters the sanctuary.
