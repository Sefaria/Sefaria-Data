Parah, Chapter Six, Mishnah One

Introduction
Today's mishnah deals with various situations in which some of the ashes fall out of the hand of the person who is about to mix them in with the water.

Mishnah One
If one was about to mix the ashes with the water and the ashes fell upon his hand or upon the side of the trough and then fell into the trough, the mixture is invalid. 
If they fell from the tube into the trough, the mixture is invalid. 
If he took the ashes from the tube and then covered it, or shut a door, the ashes remain valid but the water becomes invalid. 
If he put it up erect on the ground, the water becomes invalid. 
If in his hand, the water is valid, since it is impossible [otherwise]

Explanation
Section one: In all of these cases the mixture is invalid because the ashes must be put by a person directly into the water. The fact that there is something intervening (his hand or the side of the trough) renders the mixture invalid.
Section two: The ashes were put into a tube for storage (see 5:4). If they fall directly from the tube into the water, the mixture is invalid.
Section three: Here he takes some ashes from the tube. He then covers up the tube or closes a door before he puts the ashes into the water. The ashes remain valid and can be put into some other water. But the fact that he did "work" while occupied with the red cow ritual renders the water invalid, as we learned in 4:4. He will now have to get new water to put the ashes in. 
Section four: Similarly, if he stands the tube up on the ground, this counts as work and the water is invalid. However, if he simply stands the tube up in his hand so that the ashes don't fall out, the water is still valid because he has no choice but to do this, or something like this. This is considered "work necessary for the mixing" and such work does not render the water invalid.
