Parah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight
Hatat waters that have been invalidated [still] defile one who is clean for terumah [by contact] with his hands or with his body.
And one who is clean for the hatat they defile neither [by contact] with his hands nor [by contact] with his body. 
If they become unclean, they defile one who is clean for terumah [by contact either] with his hands or with his body, 
And one who is clean for the hatat they defile [by contact] with his hands but not [by contact] with his body.

Explanation
Section one: Hatat waters that have been invalidated (for instance, because the person did some sort of work after preparing them) still convey some degree of impurity. They defile a person who has immersed in a mikveh with the intent of eating terumah, either by contact with his hands or by contact with his body. However, they don't defile someone with regards to non-sacred produce; meaning one who wants to eat non-sacred produce and has had contact with disqualified hatat waters does not defile the produce. Note that regular hatat waters do convey impurity. 
If someone is ritually clean enough to perform the red cow ritual, then disqualified hatat waters don't defile him at all. He can still perform the ritual even after contact with him. 
Section two: Hatat waters that have been defiled convey impurity to one who is pure enough to eat terumah in the same way as do disqualified hatat waters.
The one difference between disqualified and impure hatat waters is that the latter do defile a person clean enough to perform the red cow ritual by virtue of contact with his hands. However, if they have contact with his body, he remains pure.
