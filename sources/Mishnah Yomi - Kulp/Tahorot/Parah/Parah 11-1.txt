Parah, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah One

Mishnah One
A flask that one has left uncovered and on returning found it to be covered, is invalid. 
If one left it covered and on returning found it to be uncovered, it is invalid if a weasel could have drunk from it or, according to the words of Rabban Gamaliel, a snake, or if it was possible for dew to fall into it in the night. 
The hatat waters are not protected by a tightly fitting cover; 
But water that had not yet been mixed with the ashes is protected by a tightly fitting cover.

Explanation
Section one: If he left the flask uncovered and he came back and found it covered, the water is invalid, lest the person who covered it was not pure in order to perform the hatat ritual.
Section two: If he left it covered and then found it uncovered, it is invalid if there is any possibility that a weasel or snake (according to Rabban Gamaliel) drank from it. As we saw in 9:3, these animals backwash into the water, thereby invalidating them. The water is also invalid if there is a chance that dew fell in (see 9:1).
Section two: This section refers to an earthenware jar of hatat waters left in a tent with a corpse in it. Generally speaking if the jar has a tightly fitting lid, it protects its contents from impurity. However, we have seen a special law with regard to the hatat watersâ€”they must be in a place of purity. Since he put them in a place of "impurity" the waters are invalid, even if they are pure.
However, if the jar contains water that has not yet been mixed with the ashes, it is protected from impurity (see also 10:5).  The prohibition against leaving in an impure place refers only to the mixed waters.
