Parah, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
If a man coils the rope around his hand little by little, [the mixture] is valid; 
But if he coiled it afterwards, it is invalid. 
Rabbi Yose said: this also had been ruled to be valid as a temporary measure.

Explanation
Section one: If when the person draws the full bucket out of the water he wraps the rope around his hand one coil at a time as he is lifting up, the mixture is still valid. This is not considered to be work. 
Section two: However, if he coils it up completely after he has already raised up the basket, then it counts as work and the mixture is invalid. 
Section three: Rabbi Yose says that as a temporary measure, they validated the water in a case where someone coiled the rope up after the water had been drawn. 
It is interesting that the term "as a temporary measure" appears in today's mishnah and yesterday's mishnah and nowhere else in the Mishnah (it does appear one additional time in the Tosefta). Perhaps the rabbis are setting up a system here where actions are on the one hand considered to be work and therefore should invalidate the mixture and yet on the other hand they don't want to actually claim that the mixture is invalid. So they set up a situation where the stringency is the rule but as a "temporary measure" validity is bequeathed. However we interpret the appearance of this phrase here, it is curious that it appears basically only in Parah.
