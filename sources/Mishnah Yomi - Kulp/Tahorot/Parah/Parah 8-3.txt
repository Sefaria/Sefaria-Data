Parah, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Three

Introduction
In yesterday's mishnah the person spoke to his sandal/garment saying, "That which defiled you, did not defile me, but you did defile me."Today the garment provides his comeback.

Mishnah Three
The one who burns the red cow or bulls and he that leads away the scapegoat, defile garments. 
The red cow and the bulls and the scapegoat do not themselves defile garments. 
Behold [the garment] would say [to the person], "That which defiled you did not defile me, but you did defile me.  

Explanation
Section one: The Torah specifically states that the clothes of the one who burns the red cow are defiled (Numbers 19:8). The same is true with regard to a person who burns the bulls or goats on Yom Kippur (Leviticus 16:28) or other cases of animals that are burned and of the one who leads the scapegoat to Azazel (the wilderness) on Yom Kippur (Leviticus 16:26). All of these must wash their garments because they themselves defile their own garments.  
Section two: Despite the fact that the person who performs these rituals is defiled, the animals themselves to do not defile garments. 
Section three: This leads again to the personification of the garmentâ€”it says to the person, that the cow, bull or goat that defiled you, didn't defile me. But you, Mr., did defile me!
