Oktzim, Chapter Two, Mishnah One

Mishnah One
	•	Leaves of olives pickled together with the olives remain clean, for their pickling was only for the sake of appearances. 
	•	The fibrous substance on a zucchini and the flower-like substance on it are clean.
	•	Rabbi Judah says: that as long as it is still before the merchant, it is unclean.

Explanation
Section one: Leaves of olives are not edible. Even if one pickled them with olives, he did so only for appearance sake. Therefore, they are not susceptible to impurity.
Section two: These substances that are on a zucchini are neither edible nor are they handles. Therefore, they are not susceptible to impurity.
Rabbi Judah holds that since a merchant wants to sell the zucchini (these are not necessarily identical to modern varieties) in as great of a volume as possible, as long as these are with the merchant, these parts are susceptible to impurity. However, once they are sold they are useless so they are no longer susceptible.
