Mishnah . R. Joshua b. Levi said: in the world to come the holy one, blessed be he, will make each righteous person to inherit three hundred and ten worlds, for it is written: ‘that i may cause those that love me to inherit yesh; and that i may fill their treasuries’. R. Simeon b. Halafta said: the holy one, blessed be he, found no vessel that could contain blessing for israel save that of peace, as it is written: ‘the lord will give strength unto his people; the lord will bless his people with peace’.
