Negaim, Chapter Six, Mishnah One

Introduction
Today's mishnah deals with how large a nega/bright spot must be for it to be impure.

Mishnah One
The minimum size of a bright spot must be that of a Cilician split bean squared.  
The space covered by a split bean equals that of nine lentils.
The space covered by a lentil equals that of four hairs;   
It turns out that the size of a bright spot must be no less than that of thirty-six hairs.  

Explanation
Section one:  The bright spot must be the size of a squared Cicilian split bean. Cicilia is an area in Asia Minor.
Sections two-four: 9 x 4 is 36, so you can fit 36 hairs into a Cicilian bean. Either those are some big beans, or those are some hairy people!
