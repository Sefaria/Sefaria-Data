Negaim, Chapter Twelve, Mishnah One

Introduction
Chapter Twelve deals with negaim that are found in houses. This is referred to in Leviticus 14:33-53.
The first mishnah of the chapter deals with which types of houses are susceptible to negaim. It is similar to the first mishnah of chapter eleven.

Mishnah One
All houses may contract negaim uncleanness, except those of non-Jews. 
If one bought houses from non-Jews, any it must be inspected as if they had then first appeared. 
A round house, a triangular house, or a house built on a ship, on a raft or on four beams, is not susceptible to negaim uncleanness.
But if it was four-sided, even if it was built on four pillars, it is susceptible to uncleanness.

Explanation
Section one: As was the case with garment-negaim, only houses owned by Jews are susceptible to negaim.
Section two: If a Jew buys a house from a non-Jew and it has a nega, the inspection procedure begins anew, as it would if the nega had just appeared. 
Section three: Only square houses that are built on the ground are susceptible to impurity. A "house built on beams" refers to a house that is built on beams that jut out from another building. Such a house does not directly rest on the ground and therefore is not susceptible to impurity. 
Section four: However, four-sided houses are susceptible even if they are built on pillars that come out of the ground. In other words, the house does not have to be built directly on the ground. It can be built on another structure (but not a building) that comes out of the ground.
