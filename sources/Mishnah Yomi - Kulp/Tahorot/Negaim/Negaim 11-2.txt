Negaim, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with cases where two types of wool or two flax and hemp have been hackled together to make one garment. 

Mishnah Two
Camel's wool and sheep's wool that have been hackled together:
If the majority is camel's hair, they are not susceptible to negaim; 
But if the majority is sheep's wool they are susceptible to negaim. 
If it is half and half they are susceptible to negaim. 
And the same law applies also to linen and hemp that have been hackled together.  

Explanation
Section one: Camel's wool is not susceptible to negaim impurity because the "wool" mentioned in Leviticus is considered to be only sheep's wool.
Therefore, if the majority of the garment is made of sheep's wool, or if even half of the garment is made of sheep's wool, it is susceptible to negaim. But if it is mostly camel's wool, it is not susceptible. 
We should note that in this case the camel and sheep's wool have been joined together so well that it is impossible to recognize which is which. This is what distinguishes this case from yesterday's mishnah, where a garment of wool or linen was attached to a garment made of skins of sea animals. In that case, since the garment of wool or linen was recognizable on its own, the entire garment became susceptible to impurity.
Section two: Linen (made from flax) and hemp are closely related, but only the former is susceptible to negaim (because it is mentioned specifically by the Torah). Therefore, the rules here are the same as above.
