Negaim, Chapter Four, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with cases that are similar to that found in yesterday's mishnah—a bright spot both spread (a sign of impurity) and contracted during the same period of isolation. The question is: does this count as spreading?

Mishnah Nine
A bright spot the size of a split bean that spread to the extent of half a split bean and a little more, while as much as half the size of a split bean disappeared from the original spot: 
Rabbi Akiva says that it is unclean,   
But the sages say that it is clean.   
A bright spot the size of a split bean that spread to the extent of a split bean and a little more, while the original spot disappeared:
Rabbi Akiva says that is it unclean,   
But the sages say: it should be inspected as a new one. 

Explanation
Section one: In this case the bright spot spread more than the amount that disappeared. In other words, it had a net gain in size. Rabbi Akiva says that this counts as spreading. The rabbis say that since that since it did not spread sufficiently, the spreading is not enough to count it as pure. If he is at the end of the second week of isolation, he will be pronounced pure. 
Section two: In this case, the original spot disappeared altogether. The spreading is large enough to be itself a nega. Rabbi Akiva is consistent in his opinion—this counts as spreading and not as a new nega. Therefore, he is impure. The other sages say that since the old nega has completely disappeared, this counts as a new nega and it must be inspected as such. He will begin a new period of isolation.
