Negaim, Chapter Three, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
Head or beard (scall) negaim become unclean for two weeks and by one of the following two signs: by yellow thin hair or by a spreading. 
"By yellow thin hair" in the beginning, at the end of the first week, at the end of the second week, or after they have been pronounced clean.  
"Or by a spreading," at the end of the first week, at the end of the second week or after they have been pronounced clean.
They become unclean for two weeks which are only thirteen days.

Explanation
Section one: Today's mishnah deals with negaim that are found on the head or beard. This topic is dealt with directly in Leviticus 13:29. Such negaim are identified by a thin yellow hair (Leviticus 13:30) or by spreading.
Section two: The yellow thin hair can serve as an identifying mark at the beginning of the examination period, or at the end of any of the weeks of isolation.
Section three: The spreading must occur at the end of at least one of the weeks.
Section four: Same as mishnah three.
