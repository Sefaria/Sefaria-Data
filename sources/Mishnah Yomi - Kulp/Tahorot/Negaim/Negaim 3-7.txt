Negaim, Chapter Three, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
According to Leviticus 13 clothes and houses can also contract negaim. Our mishnah deals with the signs of negaim for clothes (Leviticus 13:47ff). 

Mishnah Seven
Garments become unclean for two weeks and by one of three signs: by a greenish color, by a reddish color or by a spreading. 
"By a greenish colour or by a reddish color," in the beginning, at the end of the first week, at the end of the second week, or after they have been pronounced clean.
"Or by a spreading," at the end of the first week, at the end of the second week, or after they have been pronounced clean. 
They become unclean for two weeks which are but thirteen days.      


Explanation
Section one: The sign of a nega in a garment is a greenish or reddish color, or the spread of the nega later on in its development.
Section two: When the garment is brought to the priest and it has a reddish or greenish nega, the priest will isolate it for one week. If the nega remains, he will isolate it for a second week. If it remains after two weeks, he will pronounce it unclean and burn the clothing. 
Section three: Similarly, if it spreads, he will burn the clothing.
Section four: Same as in previous mishnayot.
