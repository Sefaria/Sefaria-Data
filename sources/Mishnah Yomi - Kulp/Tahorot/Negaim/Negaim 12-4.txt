Negaim, Chapter Twelve, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Today's mishnah deals with how much wood and earth must be in the wall for it to be susceptible to impurity. 

Mishnah Four
[And how much] wood [must be in the wall for it to susceptible]?   
Enough to be set under the lintel. 
Rabbi Judah says: it must suffice to make the support at the back of the lintel.   
[And how much] earth [must be in the wall for it to susceptible]? 
Such as would suffice to fill up the space between one row of stones and another. 
The walls of a cattle-trough or the walls of a partition are not susceptible to the uncleanness of negaim. 
A house in Jerusalem or in any place outside the land of Israel is not susceptible to the uncleanness of negaim. 

Explanation
Section one: According to the first opinion, there needs to be enough wood on each house to be used under the lintel. The Rambam explains that this wood is used to support the stone lintel while it is being built.
Rabbi Judah says that there must be enough to support the back of the lintel. This was used to keep the lintel straight.
Section two: There also must be enough earth to fill up the space between two rows of stones. 
Section three: The walls must be of living quarters for them to be susceptible to impurity. The walls of a cattle-trough used to feed cattle are not susceptible to negaim. Similarly, walls used to partition off rooms of a house are not susceptible. 
Section four: Leviticus 14:34 states, "In the land of your possession." According to the rabbis, this means that houses in Jerusalem, which was not part of any tribe's possession, are not susceptible. Houses outside the land of Israel are also not susceptible because they too are not part of Israel's ancestral possession.
