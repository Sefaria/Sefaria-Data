Negaim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
A bright spot the size of a split bean in which there was quick flesh the size of a lentil and then it broke out covering a person's entire skin and then the quick flesh disappeared, or if the quick flesh disappeared and then the bright spot broke out covering all his skin, he is clean.   
If quick flesh arose [subsequently], he is unclean.   
If white hair grew [subsequently]:
Rabbi Joshua rules that he is unclean,   
But the sages rule that he is clean.

Explanation
Section one: At the outset, this person had a bright spot (nega) with quick flesh and the priest declared him impure. Then the nega spread to his entire body, except for the quick flesh (where there is no nega) and then the nega spread to the area of the quick flesh as well. Since the nega now covers his entire body, he is pure. The mishnah teaches that the nega does not need to cover his entire body in one stage. 
The same is true if the quick flesh first disappears and then the nega spreads to the entire body, including the area that had previously been quick flesh. Since it covers his entire body, he is pure.
Section two: If quick flesh appears in the midst of a nega that covers his entire body, he is impure because the nega no longer covers his entire body. See Leviticus 13:14. 
Section three: The mishnah now discusses what happens if white hair appears in the midst of the nega that covers his entire body. Leviticus 13:14 says that if quick flesh (undiscolored flesh) appears in the body-covering nega he is impure. Rabbi Joshua reasons that just as quick flesh is a sign of impurity so too is white hair, which is also usually a sign of impurity. The sages read the Torah more literally. Since the Torah mentions quick flesh and not white hairs, it means to say that quick flesh and not white hairs is a sign of impurity in a body-covering nega.
