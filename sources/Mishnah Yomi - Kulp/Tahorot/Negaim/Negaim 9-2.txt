Negaim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
A boil and a burn do not combine, nor do they spread from one to the other, nor do they spread from there to the skin of the flesh, nor does [a nega] on the skin of the flesh spread to them.  
If they were festering they are clean.  
If they formed a scale as thick as garlic peel, such is the scar of the boil that is spoken of in the Torah.  
If they were subsequently healed, even though there was a mark in their place, they are regarded as the skin of the flesh. 

Explanation
Section one: If there is a boil the size of a half a split bean and a burn the size of half a split bean, they do not combine to form a nega the size of a split bean. 
Also, if a boil and a burn are right next to each other and the nega spreads from one to the other, it is not considered as having spread and it is pure.
If the nega spreads from the boil or burn to other skin, or if a nega from other skin spreads into the burn or boil, it is not considered to have spread. Rather, the nega must spread within the boil or burn. Put simply: the burn and boil nega are considered completely separately from an adjacent nega. 
Section two: If the boil or burn is still festering, it is pure. This was explained in 6:8.
Section three: Leviticus 13:23 states, "But if the boil (inflammation) remains stationary, not having spread, it is the scar of the boil (inflammation); the priest shall pronounce him clean." The rabbis explain that this doesn't refer to a boil (or burn in v. 28) that have healed completely. Rather, a little bit of a scab seems to have formed on it. Since the bright spot didn't spread (see the verse) he is not isolated for a second week, as he would be for other negaim. Rather he is pronounced clean. 
Section four: If the boil or burn completely heals, it is treated like regular skin, even if a mark remains. If a new nega appears there, the nega is treated like a regular nega, and not one that formed in a boil or burn.
