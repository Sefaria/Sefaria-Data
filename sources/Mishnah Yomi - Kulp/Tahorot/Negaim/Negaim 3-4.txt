Negaim, Chapter Three, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
A boil or a burn becomes unclean for one week and by one of the following two tokens: by white hair or by a spreading. 
By white hair, in the beginning, at the end of the week, or after it has been pronounced clean. 
"Or by a spreading:" At the end of the week, or after it had been declared clean. They become unclean for a week which is seven days. 

Explanation
Section one: The Torah mentions a nega found in a boil or a burn (Leviticus 13: 18, 25). But it does not mention a two week period of isolation in connection with such a nega. Therefore, a person can become impure after only one week of isolation. Also, quick flesh is not a sign here, as it was for a nega found on regular skin.
Sections two and three: These are the same as yesterday's mishnah, except there are only two signs and the uncleanness happens after one week, not two.
