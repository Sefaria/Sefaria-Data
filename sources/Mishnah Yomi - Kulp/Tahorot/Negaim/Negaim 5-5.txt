Negaim, Chapter Five, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Today's mishnah clarifies when cases of doubt are deemed unclean. 

Mishnah Five
"But after uncleanness has been established a doubt is regarded as unclean."   
How so? If two men came to a priest, one having a bright spot of the size of a split bean and the other having one of the size of a sela and at the end of the week each was of the size of a sela and a little more, both are unclean;  
And even though both returned to be the size of a sela both are unclean, and remain unclean until they return to the size of a split split bean. 
They is what they meant when they said, "but after uncleanness has been established a doubt is regarded as unclean."

Explanation
Section one: This is a quote from mishnah four.
Section two: The difference between this mishnah and yesterday's mishnah is that in this case, both negaim spread. One began at the size of a split bean and spread to be a bit larger than a sela, and one started as a sela and spread just a little bit. Nevertheless, since both spread both are impure.
Section three: They remain impure even if both return to be the size of a sela. This is the "doubt." One of these has returned to its original size, and since the "spreading" is gone, that one should be pure. But since they were already pronounced unclean, they both remain impure until the spreading has certainly disappeared from both. 
Section four: A summary of what was taught above.
