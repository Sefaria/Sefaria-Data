Negaim, Chapter Five, Mishnah One

Mishnah One
Any doubtful nega is regarded as clean, except this case and one other. 
Which is that? If he had a bright spot of the size of a split bean and he was isolated, and by the end of the week it was as big as a sela, and it is doubtful whether it is the original one or whether another came in its place, he must be regarded as unclean.  

Explanation
Section one: In general, in a doubtful case concerning a nega, meaning it is unclear whether it is or is not a nega, the affected person is considered clean. However, there are two exceptions. The first is the case we saw in yesterday's mishnah (4:11) and the second case is in this mishnah.
Section two: Originally, the nega was the size of a split bean. This is large enough to cause him to be isolated for a week to see if it spreads or if white hairs appear. By the end of the first week, the nega is the size of a sela, a coin which is much larger than a split bean. It is unclear whether this is the original nega and it just spread or if it is a new nega. If it is a new nega, he would start a new period of isolation. However, in this case the halakhah is strict and we consider the original nega to have spread, causing him to be impure.
