Negaim, Chapter Three, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight
Houses become unclean for three weeks and by one of the following three signs: by a greenish color or by a reddish color or by a spreading. 
"By a greenish color or by a reddish color," in the beginning, at the end of the first week, at the end of the second week, at the end of the third week, or after they have been pronounced clean.
"Or by a spreading," at the end of the first week, at the end of the second week, at the end of the third week, or after they have been pronounced clean. 
They become unclean for three weeks which are nineteen days.   
None of the leprosy signs is for less than a week or for more than three weeks.   

Explanation
Section one: A house has a three week period of impurity and not two like most human negaim and negaim found in clothes (see Leviticus 14:35ff). House impurity will be discussed in chapter twelve.
The signs of a house nega are green or red colored spots, or a spreading after the initial nega has been identified.
Sections 2-4: Same as in previous mishnayot.
Section five: This is a summary of all of the laws in most of this chapter. The shortest period is for the nega found in a boil or burn (mishnah four) and the longest period is for negaim found in a house.
