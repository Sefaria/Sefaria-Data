Negaim, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Twelve

Introduction
Today's mishnah, the last mishnah about garment-negaim, deals with some differences in the status between a garment that has been isolated to see if an impure nega develops, and a garment that has already been declared impure. 

Mishnah Twelve
If a garment that had been isolated was mixed up with others, all are clean.   
If it was cut up and made into shreds, it is clean, and benefit may be derived from it.
But if a garment that had been certified unclean was mixed up with others, all are unclean. 
If it was cut up and made into shreds it also remains unclean and it is forbidden to have any benefit from it.

Explanation
Section one:  The garment that was isolated is considered to be "doubtfully impure." And since we don't know which of the garments was the one that was isolated, they are all "doubly doubtful." And in cases of "double doubts" the law is lenient—therefore all of the garments are pure. [We should note that the rabbis loved to talk about this subject—cases where the status of something was doubtful]. 
Section two: The garment that was isolated was then cut up into small pieces. These pieces are too small to become impure, therefore they are pure and benefit may be derived from them.
Sections three and four: In these cases, the garment was certainly impure. Therefore, the law is the opposite. All of the mixed up garments are unclean and it would be forbidden to derive benefit from any of them.
