Negaim, Chapter Fourteen, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
The mitzvah of the cedarwood is for it to be one cubit in length, and in thickness a quarter of that of the leg of a bed, when one leg is divided into two halves and these two into four.   
The mitzvah of the hyssop is that it should be neither ezovyon (lavendula) nor blue hyssop nor Roman hyssop nor wild hyssop nor any kind of hyssop that has an accompanying name. 

Explanation
Section one: The piece of cedarwood used in sprinkling the blood on the metzora must be one cubit long. It must be as thick as a quarter of the leg of a bed. It seems that people would know approximately how thick the leg of a bed is. The mishnah even describes actually dividing the leg of a bed into four parts in order to determine how thick the cedarwood can be.
Section two: The hyssop must be plain old hyssop (zatar in Arabic and by extension, modern Hebrew). Any hyssop that has an accompanying or modifying name should not be used.
