Negaim, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Yesterday's mishnah dealt with two scalls next to each other but separated by a line of hair. Today's mishnah deals with two scalls where one surrounds the other, and there is a line of hair separating the inside one from the outside one. 

Mishnah Seven
Two scalls one within the other and a line of hair separating between them: 
If there appeared a gap in one place the inner one is unclean,   
But if in two places it is clean.   
How big must the gap be?  The space of two hairs. 
If there was a gap in one place of the size of a split bean he is clean.  

Explanation
Section one: If one gap opens up between the two scalls then the inner one is unclean because it is considered to have spread. The line of hairs adjacent to it does not afford protection because it is at the side of the inner scall. But the outer scall is not impure because there are two hairs which it surrounds. To reiterate: hairs which exist prior to the scall must be inside in order to afford protection (see mishnah three). 
If, however, there are two gaps, then both scalls are considered one and the black hairs afford protection
Section two: Same as yesterday's mishnah.
Section three: If there is only one gap between them and the outer scall encompasses the inner one, then if the gap is the size of a split bean it causes the two scalls to be considered as one. The black hairs inside the scall mean that it is pure.
