Negaim, Chapter Fourteen, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Today's mishnah continues to describe the process of the metzora bringing his offerings. 

Mishnah Eight
He comes to the guilt-offering and he puts his two hands on it.
He then slaughters it. 
Two priests receive its blood, one in a vessel and the other in his hand.   
He who received it in the vessel proceeded to sprinkle it on the wall of the altar. 
The one who received it in his hand would approach the metzora. 
The metzora had in the meantime immersed himself in the chamber of the metzoraim.
He would come and stand at the Nikanor gate.   
Rabbi Judah says: he did not require immersion. 

Explanation
Section one: The metzora first comes to his guilt-offering and lays his hands on it, as is done with most sacrifices. The guilt-offering is located at Nikanor's gate, as we will see in section six.
Section two: Either a priest or an Israelite can slaughter the offering.
Section three: The blood would then be drained out into two vessels held by priests (Israelites can't do this). The blood in one vessel is sprinkled onto the altar, which is the typical action with a guilt offering. The blood of the other vessel will be put onto the metzora, so the priest goes to the area where the metzora was standing.
Section four: While the sacrifice was being slaughtered and then its blood being received, the metzora would immerse himself in the chamber designated for the metzoraim. This was located in the Women's Court (see Middot 2:5).
He would then come and stand at the Nikanor Gate which was on the eastern side of the Women's Court (see Middot 1:4). Tomorrow's mishnah will pick up with the continuing action.
Rabbi Judah notes that he does not need to immerse because he immersed the previous evening (see mishnah three).
