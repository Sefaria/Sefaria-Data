Negaim, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Today's mishnah deals with yellow hair that exists before the scall. 

Mishnah Five
Yellow hair that preceded a scall is clean. 
Rabbi Judah says that it is unclean. 
Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: it neither causes uncleanness nor does it afford protection. 
Rabbi Shimon says: anything in a scall that is not a sign of uncleanness is a sign of cleanness.  

Explanation
Section one: This opinion matches Rabbi Shimon's opinion in mishnah two. For the yellow hair to be a sign of uncleanness it must turn yellow or grow after the scall already exists. If it is there before, it is clean.
Section two: This matches Rabbi Judah's opinion in mishnah two. As long as there is yellow hair in the scall, it is a sign of impurity.
Section three: Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says that while yellow hairs that precede the scall are not a sign of uncleanness, they do not afford protection. This means that if two yellow hairs sprout after the formation of the scall, the two that existed before the scall do not protect it from being impure. 
Section four: Rabbi Shimon agrees with the opinion in section one, and disagrees with Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob. Since yellow hairs that precede the scall are not a sign of impurity, they do afford protection. If there are yellow hairs before the formation of the scall, the scall is pure even if subsequently other yellow hairs sprout.
