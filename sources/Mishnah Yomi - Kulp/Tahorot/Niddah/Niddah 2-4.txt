Niddah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
All women are in the presumption of being pure for their husband. 
For those who return from a journey, their wives are in the presumption of being pure.
Bet Shammai says: a woman needs two testing-rags for every time she has intercourse, or she must have relations in the light of a lamp.   
Bet Hillel says: two testing-rags suffice her for the whole night.

Explanation
Section one: What this means is that men do not need to ask their wives before they have intercourse if they are menstruating. Men can assume that their wives are ritually pure and that if they were menstruating, they would let them know.
Section two: One might have thought that when a man is away from the house, his wife might not be careful about her own ritual purity. After all, she is not supposed to be having sex while he is away, so why should she care about being ritually pure? The mishnah teaches that even so, when he returns home, he can assume that his wife is pure, for if she was not, she would tell him.
Section three: If a woman has sexual relations with her husband multiple times during the night, the mishnah says that she needs two testing-rags for each time, one for her and one for him. In the morning, when it is light outside, she can look at them to see if any rag has blood on it. Alternatively, she should check the rags by light after each intercourse to make sure there is no blood on it from the previous time before she uses it to check on herself again.
There are two explanations for Bet Hillel's position. Either they can simply use two testing rags one time at the end of the night, after the last time they have intercourse. Alternatively, this might mean that they can simply use the same rags to check themselves repeatedly throughout the night.
