Niddah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Ten

Mishnah Ten 
If a woman regularly observed [menstrual blood] on the fifteenth of the month, and then she changed and observed it on the twentieth—both become prohibited.
If she changed twice and observed it on the twentieth—both [are still] prohibited.
If she changed it three times to observe it on the twentieth then the fifteenth becomes permitted and the twentieth is set [as her regular day], for a woman does not establish a regular cycle until she sets it three times, and she doesn't lose her regular cycle until she is free from it three times.

Explanation
Section one: If a woman regularly menstruates on the fifteenth, and then for one or two months doesn't menstruate on the fifteenth but rather on the twentieth, she is prohibited to have sexual relations on both the fifteenth and the twentieth. The fifteenth remains prohibited because that is the day of her regular cycle, and the twentieth is prohibited because we are concerned that that date has now become her regular cycle. 
Section two: If she changes it three times, then she now has established a new menstrual cycle. She will now be prohibited from having relations only on the twentieth, but she will be permitted to have relations on the fifteenth. As the mishnah explains, it takes three times to establish a cycle and three times to undo the old cycle.
