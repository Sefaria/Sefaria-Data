Niddah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight
Whatever is subject to the law of removal is also subject to the sabbatical year.   
But there is [a kind or produce] that is subject to the sabbatical year and is not subject to the law of removal.   

Explanation
Again, there are two laws mentioned in this mishnah. The first is "the law of removal." Produce grown during the sabbatical year can be gathered into one's house and stored, but as soon as it ceases to grow in the field such that animals can eat it, it must be removed from storage in one's house.
"Subject to the sabbatical year" means that one cannot do business with itâ€”i.e. bring it to the marketplace and sell it there. Furthermore, any produce that grows in one's field must be made ownerless.  
All produce is "subject to the sabbatical year." However, if the produce grows in the field all year round, and is always available for animal consumption, then it need not be removed from one's house. Sheviit 7:2 gives some examples.
