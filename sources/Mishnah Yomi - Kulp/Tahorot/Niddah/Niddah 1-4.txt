Niddah, Chapter One, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
Who is regarded as "virgin"? 
Any woman who has never yet observed a blood flow, even if she is married. 
"A woman in pregnancy"? One whose fetus is notice. 
"A nursing woman"? Until she has weaned her child. 
If she gave her child to a nursing woman, if she weaned him, or if he died:
Rabbi Meir says: she conveys uncleanness retroactively for twenty-four hours;  
But the sages say: it suffices for her [to reckon her period of uncleanness from] the time of her [observation of the flow].

Explanation
Section one: A virgin, at least in this mishnah, is a woman who has not yet begun menstruating. It does not refer to a woman who has never had sexual intercourse. According to this definition of a "virgin" which probably should be translated as "young girl", even a married woman could be a virgin.
Section two: A woman is considered "pregnant" only when the fetus begins to be noticed.
Section three: The standard period for nursing is 24 months. A woman is considered to be nursing only during this period. Even if she continues to actually nurse after 24 months, she is no longer in this category.
Section four: The mishnah now deals with the opposite caseâ€”where for various reasons the woman is no longer nursing her son. According to Rabbi Meir, since she is no longer nursing, she is no longer in the category of a woman who does not need to be retroactively concerned that she defiled things. When she discovers that she is bleeding, everything that touched in the previous 24 hours is impure. 
The sages disagree and consider this woman to still be in the category of a nursing woman. It seems that they think that she probably won't resume menstruating for this period.
