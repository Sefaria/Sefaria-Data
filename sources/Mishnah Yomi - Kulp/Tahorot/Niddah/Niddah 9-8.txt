Niddah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
The next three mishnayot return to the subject of a woman who has a regular menstrual period. To recall from the first chapter, if a woman is able to establish a regular period, then she does not retroactively defile the things she touches. 

Mishnah Eight
For any woman who has a regular period it suffices [to reckon her period of uncleanness from] the time she discovers the flow. 
And these are the signs of a regular period: [if the woman] yawns, sneezes, feels pain at the top of   her stomach or the bottom of her bowels, discharges mucus, or is seized by a kind of shivering, or any other similar symptoms.   
Any woman who established for herself [one of the symptoms] three times behold this is a regular period.

Explanation
Section one: This section is found in 1:1. As I explained there, if a woman has a regular cycle, she defiles things only from the time in which she discovered that she was menstruating.
Sections two and three: In addition to a period that comes at a fixed time period, there are other signs that if followed by menstruation would allow a woman to establish a regular period. In other words, if a woman experiences one of these symptoms and then begins to menstruate closely thereafter, and this occurs three times (see section three) then she can use this sign to establish her cycle. The third time she yawns, for instance, and then has her period close thereafter, she will be able to reckon her uncleanness from the time she discovered the flow. She will not retroactively defile things that she touched during the last twenty-four hour period or the since the last time that she examined herself.
