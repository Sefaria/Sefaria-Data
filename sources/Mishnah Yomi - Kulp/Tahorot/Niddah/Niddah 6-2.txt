Niddah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Two

Introduction
The next 9 mishnayot have nothing to do with the topic at hand. Rather, they are all formulated in the same format as yesterday's mishnahâ€”it is possible for x without y, but it is not possible for y without x. 

Mishnah Two
Similarly, any [hole in] an earthen vessel that lets in a liquid  will  let it out, but there may be one that will let liquid out and will not let it in.   
Any limb that grows a nail also has a bone in it, but there may be one that has a bone in it but does not grow a nail.   

Explanation
Section one: An earthenware vessel that has a hole large enough that it lets liquid in is pure because it is no longer usable (see Kelim 3:1, 8:2). Any vessel that has a hole large enough to let in liquid will also let it out. However, there may be a vessel that lets liquid out but doesn't let it in. Such a vessel is still considered usable and is therefore still impure.
Section two: A limb from a corpse that has a nail is impure, even if the limb is very small (see Ohalot 1:7). Any limb that grows a nail will also grow a bone, but there can be a limb that has a bone without a nail. The Talmud explains that an extra finger (or toe) that doesn't have a nail does defile through contact and by being carried but it doesn't convey impurity in an ohel (a tent) as would a limb with a nail.
