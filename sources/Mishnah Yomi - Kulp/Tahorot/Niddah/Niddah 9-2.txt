Niddah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
A man and a woman did their needs in the same bowl and blood was found on the water:
Rabbi Yose says it is clean,  
Rabbi Shimon says that it was unclean, since it is not usual for a man to discharge blood, but nevertheless the presumption is that blood is from the woman. 

Explanation
A man and woman both urinated into the same chamber pot, and it is unclear whether the blood was from the woman or the man. Rabbi Yose, remaining consistent with his opinion from yesterday's mishnah, says that the woman is clean. After all, even if we know the blood is from her, Rabbi Yose considers her clean. 
Rabbi Shimon says that it is extremely unusual for a man to discharge blood while urinating. While it may be unusual for a woman to do so, we nevertheless must presume that it is her blood and therefore it is unclean.
