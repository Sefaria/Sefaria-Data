Niddah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
Three women who were sleeping in one bed and blood was found under one of them, they are all unclean. 
If one of them examined herself and was found to be unclean, she alone is unclean while the two others are clean, [for] they may attribute the blood to one another.   
And if they were [all] not likely to observe blood, they must be regarded as though they were likely to observe one. 

Explanation
Section one: This is similar to yesterday's mishnah. Since we do not know whom the discharge is from, we must consider all of them to be impure. 
Section two: If one of the three examined herself and found that she was menstruating, the other women can consider themselves to be pure. Similarly, if one of the women was the type of womn not considered likely to menstruate, a young woman, a pregnant woman, a nursing woman or an old woman (see 1:3) then she can attribute the blood to the other women. They will be impure and she will be pure.
Section three: If all three women were of the category of women who are unlikely to menstruate, then obviously we must attribute the blood to one of them. Since there is no reason to attribute it to one any more than the other, all three must be considered impure, as is the case in section one.
