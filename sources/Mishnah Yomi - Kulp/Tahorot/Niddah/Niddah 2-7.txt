Niddah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Today's mishnah explains the colors found in section one of yesterday's mishnah. 

Mishnah Seven
What is considered red? Like the red of a wound.
Black: Like ink-sediment.
Darker than this is impure.
Lighter than this is pure.
Like bright crocus: like the clearest shade in it.
Like earthy water: from the Bet Kerem valley, when water floats over it.
Like diluted wine: two parts water, one part wine, from wine of the Sharon. 

Explanation
Section one:  Red is simply like the color of blood that flows from a wound.
Section two: Black refers to the black ink used to dye shoes.
If it is darker than this black, it is impure. But if it is a lighter shade of black, it is pure.
Section three: The color of the blood that matches the crocus flower must be like the brightest shade of the crocus. 
Section four: To determine the color of the earthy water, one should bring earth from the Bet Kerem valley, which Albeck says is in the north. Then water should be floated above this earth. The color of the water is the color of the red described in the mishnah.
Section five: As we have learned on many occasions, in the Greco-Roman world, wine was drunk diluted with water. Typically, this consisted of two parts water, one part wine. Thus, this is the color of the diluted wine used as a reference point in the previous mishnah. The wine should be the wine from the Sharon, which is also in the northern part of Israel.
