Niddah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Nine

Mishnah Nine
If a woman usually observed her menstrual discharge at the onset of the symptoms of her regular periods, all clean things that she handled while the symptoms were in progress are unclean.
But if she regularly observed them at the end of the symptoms, all clean things that she handled while the symptoms lasted remain clean. 
Rabbi Yose says: even days and hours may determine regular periods: if she regularly observed blood flow at sunrise she is forbidden intercourse at sunrise only.
Rabbi Judah says: all that day is hers.

Explanation
Section one:  The symptoms mentioned in yesterday's mishnah can last for a while. Our mishnah questions the purity status of the pure things she handled while the symptoms were occurring but before she saw blood flow. If usually she sees blood flow at the onset of these symptoms, then we must assume that the same thing occurred in this case. The things she touched while she experienced these symptoms are impure. 
But if she usually sees blood only at the end of her experience of these symptoms, then the things she touched while experiencing the symptoms remain pure.
Section two: If a woman has established a pattern of only seeing blood at certain times or on certain days, then those too can be used to keep anything she touched earlier pure and to allow sexual relations before this time period. For instance, if she usually begins to menstruate at sunrise and not before, then it becomes forbidden to have relations only at sunrise on the day that she expects to see blood flow. In other words, if they're up for a little early morning love, then they have the rabbis' permission!
Section three: Rabbi Judah disagrees with Rabbi Yose and holds that there is no such thing as a regular time period with regard to hours. If she expects to begin to menstruate on a particular day, she is forbidden to have relations that entire day.
