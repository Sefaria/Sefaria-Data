Niddah, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four 
If a zav, a zavah, a niddah, a woman after childbirth or a metzora have died [their corpses] they convey uncleanness by being carried until the flesh has decayed. 
If a non-Jew has died he does not convey uncleanness.   
Bet Shammai says: all women die as niddot.
But Bet Hillel says: a woman is not regarded as a niddah unless she died while she was in menstruation. 

Explanation
Section one: When alive these categories of people defile while being carried, even without contact. This continues when they are dead, as long as the flesh has not yet decayed. In other words, it is the flesh that defiles, not the spirit or life force, and therefore as long as the flesh is still there, the body still defiles in the same way.
Section two: While alive, the impurity of a non-Jew is likened to that of a zav (see 4:3). However, this is just a stringency—from Torah law a non-Jew does not defile at all. Therefore, when he/she dies, the body no longer defiles in the same way it did before. 
Section three: According to Bet Shammai, all women are presumed to have died while menstruating. This is a stringency, not a declaration of fact. This would mean that all women defile by carrying when they are dead until the flesh decays. 
Bet Hillel rules more leniently—only women who actually died while niddot defile through carrying.
