Niddah, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
If a woman died and a quarter of a log of blood comes out of her, it   conveys uncleanness as a bloodstain and it also conveys uncleanness in a tent.   
Rabbi Judah says: it does not convey uncleanness as a stain, since it was detached after she had died.   
Rabbi Judah agrees that when a woman was sitting on the birthing stool and died and a quarter of a log of blood issued from her, it conveys uncleanness as a bloodstain.   
Rabbi Yose says: therefore it does not convey uncleanness in a tent.

Explanation
Section one: If the blood came out of the woman while she had been alive, it would have counted as menstrual blood. It would defile by carrying and by contact, and it would not need to be a quarter of a log in order to defile. The blood of a dead body, on the other hand, doesn't defile by carrying but does defile if found in a tent (i.e. if it is overshadowed by something it defiles other things that are also overshadowed by the same thing). And it must be a quarter of a log in quantity to defile. 
The first opinion in the mishnah rules stringently—this quarter of a log of blood defiles as if it was menstrual blood and it defiles as if it came from a dead body.
Rabbi Judah disagrees—this blood is not considered menstrual because it left the body after death. It will only defile in a tent or by contact, and there needs to be 1/4 of a log.
Section two: However, Rabbi Judah agrees that if a woman is about to die and at that very moment blood comes forth, this blood counts as menstrual, since it came out before she died. Rabbi Yose adds that since it is considered menstrual, it does not defile by overshadowing. Only blood from a dead body defiles in this manner
