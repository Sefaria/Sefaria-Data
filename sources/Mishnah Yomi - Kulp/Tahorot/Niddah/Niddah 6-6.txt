Niddah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
Whatever is subject to peah   is also subject to tithes.
But there is [produce] which is subject to tithes and is not subject to peah.

Explanation
The category of produce that is subject to peah (leaving the corner of one's fields) is narrower than that liable for tithes. For produce to be liable for peah it has to be a type that ripens and is harvested all at the same time. Thus, figs, which ripen gradually, are not liable to peah. The produce also has to be able to be stored for a long time, so vegetables are not liable to peah (see Peah 1:4).
However, anything that is liable for peah is in the category of liable for tithes.
