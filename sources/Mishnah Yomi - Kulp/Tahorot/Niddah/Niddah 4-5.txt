Niddah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
How long can protracted labor [be considered] as lasting?  
Rabbi Meir says: even forty or fifty days.  
Rabbi Judah say: the [ninth] month suffices for her.   
Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon says: protracted labor is not for more than two weeks [before birth]. 

Explanation
Section one: Today's mishnah asks how long we can consider a woman to be in protracted labor such that any blood flow is considered niddah and not zivah. Remember, this is a leniency, for if it were considered zivah, she would need to have seven clean days to become pure. The question is not empirical—how long could a woman actually have protracted labor. The question is legal—how long can we legally attribute the blood to being from labor and not blood of zivah?
Section two: Rabbi Meir says even forty, fifty days, which might mean that there is no limit whatsoever. Any time she has protracted labor, the blood is considered menstrual, as long as she didn't stop having the labor pains.
Section three: Rabbi Judah says that blood during the entire ninth month of her pregnancy is considered menstrual and not zivah, as long as she is having labor pains along with it. 
Section four: Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon say that she can be considered to be in protracted labor only for the two weeks before birth. Blood before this period must be considered zivah blood.
