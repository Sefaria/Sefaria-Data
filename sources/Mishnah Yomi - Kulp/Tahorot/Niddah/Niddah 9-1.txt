Niddah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah One

Mishnah One
A woman who was attending to her needs and observed an issue of blood: 
Rabbi Meir says: if she was standing she is unclean but if she was sitting she remains clean. 
Rabbi Yose says: in either case she is clean.

Explanation
A woman is urinating and sees blood while urinating. Rabbi Meir says that if she is standing it is possible that the blood is a result of forceful urinating. According to Rabbi Meir, when a woman urinates while standing she must make an extra effort, and that effort might cause her to bleed.
Rabbi Yose says that in both cases we can assume that the blood comes from some sort of wound and that it is not menstrual.
