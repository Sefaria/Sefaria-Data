Niddah, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
If a dead sheretz was found in an alley it causes uncleanness retrospectively to such time as one can say, "I examined this alley and there was no sheretz in it," or to such time as it was last swept. 
So also a bloodstain found on a garment causes uncleanness retrospectively to such time as one can say, "I examined this shirt and there was no stain on it" or to such time as it was last washed. 
And it conveys uncleanness whether it is wet or dry.   
Rabbi Shimon says: if it is dry it causes uncleanness retrospectively, but if it is wet it causes uncleanness only to a time when it could still have been wet.

Explanation
Section one: A dead sheretz defiles anything that touches it. If a sheretz is found in an alley, everything pure in the alley must be considered impure lest it was touched by the sheretz. This retroactive impurity covers everything that was in the alley until we can be sure that the sheretz wasn't there. We can be sure of this either by someone testifying that he examined the alley or by the alley having been cleaned.
Section two: Similarly, if one finds a bloodstain on a garment, any clean things that touched the cloak are impure until such a point when we can ascertain that the stain wasn't there. 
Section three: This section connects this mishnah to the topic of yesterday's mishnahâ€”whether defiling substances need to be moist to defile. According to the first opinion, the sheretz and blood stain defile even if they are found dry, because they might have been moist when they defiled the clean things.
Rabbi Shimon says that we can use the fact that only moist things defile to limit the retroactive impurity. If for instance we know that the stain or sheretz could not have been moist three days ago because it is really dry now, then it doesn't defile things it might have touched in the past three days.  But if something might have touched it when it was wet, it is impure.
