Niddah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Today's mishnah distinguishes between pure and impure blood that flow from various sources in a woman's body.

Mishnah Five
The sages spoke of a woman through a metaphor: 
A chamber, a vestibule and an upper chamber.  
The blood of the chamber is unclean, 
If blood is found in the vestibule,  and there arises a doubt about its character,  it is deemed unclean, because it is presumed to have come from the source.

Explanation
Section one: Building upon their analogy of a woman as a "house" (see mishnah one) the rabbis use a "house" metaphor to describe a woman's anatomy. There are many disagreements as to what parts of the anatomy these actually refer to. I will use Maimonides interpretation. 
Section two: There are three parts to a house and to the woman's anatomy. The "chamber" is equivalent to her uterus. The "vestibule" is the vagina. And the upper chamber is the cavity that contains the ovaries and fallopian tubes.
Section three: Blood that comes from the chamber is unclean. This is the source of menstrual blood. The implication in this mishnah is that if the blood comes from the upper chamber, it is clean. I am not entirely sure how it could be determined if the blood came from the upper chamber.
Section four: If blood is found on the vagina, and it is unclear whether it came from the uterus or not, the blood must be treated as unclean because it must be presumed to come from the "source" which is another word for the uterus. The practical implication of this is that if the woman touches terumah, the terumah is unclean and may not be eaten, but it is not burned. Only certainly impure terumah is burned.
