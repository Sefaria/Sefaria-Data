Niddah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
Whatever is susceptible to midras uncleanness is also susceptible to corpse-uncleanness.
But there are things that are susceptible to corpse uncleanness but not to midras-uncleanness.   

Explanation
Section one: For an item to be susceptible to midras uncleanness, which is transmitted by sitting, laying down or leaning upon something, the item must have been made to be sat upon or laid upon, for instance a mattress or a chair. Therefore, not all items are susceptible to midras uncleanness (for instance, my shirt is not susceptible). However, all vessels (this includes almost anything of practical use made by a human being) are susceptible to corpse uncleanness. So if an item, such as a sofa, is susceptible to midras uncleanness, it must also be susceptible to corpse uncleanness. 
Section two: Such as my shirt, or my cereal bowl (or your dress and serving platter, if you like).
