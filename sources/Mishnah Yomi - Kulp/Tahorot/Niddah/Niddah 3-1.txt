Niddah, Chapter Three, Mishnah One

Introduction
Chapter three deals with a woman who had a miscarriage. There are two issues here: 1) Is she impure due to having given birth? This is a subject we covered a long time ago in Bekhorot chapter 8 and Keritot chapter 1. 2) Is she impure due to menstrual blood?

Mishnah One
A woman who aborted a shapeless object:  
If there was blood with it, she is unclean,  
If not, she is clean.
Rabbi Judah says: in either case she is unclean.

Explanation
Section one: A shapeless object does not count as a miscarried birth. Therefore, she is impure only if blood accompanies the miscarriage. Such blood counts as menstrual blood.
Section two: Rabbi Judah agrees that the shapeless object does not count as a miscarriage. However, he considers the object to be congealed blood. Therefore, even if there is not any other blood, she is impure as a menstruant.
