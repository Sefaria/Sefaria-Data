Bava Kamma Chapter Eight Mishnayoth Two and Three

Introduction
Mishnah two compares payments for injuries caused by an ox with payments for injuries caused by a human.  Mishnah three deals with several laws related to personal injury.  

Mishnah Two
The law is more strict in the case of a man than in the case of an ox:  for a man must pay for injury, pain, medical costs, loss of income and indignity, and make restitution for the value of the young; whereas the ox pays only for injury and is not liable for the value of the young. 

Explanation
This mishnah lists the differences in liability for an ox that injures versus a human who injures. As we learned in the previous mishnah a human who injures another person must make five different payments.  An ox, however, who injures a human being pays only for the injury itself.  Furthermore, if a human should injure a woman and cause her to miscarry, he is obligated to pay for the value of the miscarried child/ren.  An ox that injures is not liable for this payment.  (For the assessment of such a payment see above 5:4).
