Bava Kamma Chapter Three
Mishnah Two
If a man poured out water in the public domain, and another was injured thereby, he is liable for his injury.  
If a man hid thorns or glass [in the public domain] or made his fence out of thorns, or if his fence fell into the public domain and others were thereby injured, he is obligated for their injury.

Explanation
Section one: The second mishnah lists some common ways in which a person might put a damaging object into the public domain.
Section two: In section 2 we learn that even though he may have tried to keep them out of people’s way, if they are harmful materials he is responsible for subsequent damages.
One might want to consider the implications these mishnayot have on modern ecological problems.  The sages considered the public domain to belong to everyone and as such no one was allowed to place there potentially dangerous material.  

Questions for Further Thought:
What is the difference between the cases in clause 2 of the first mishnah and clause 1 of the second mishnah?
Rabbi Judah distinguishes between deliberate and inadvertent breaking of the jug.  Evidently the sage(s) who taught the clause preceding Rabbi Judah did not make such a distinction.  According to them one would be obligated even if the jug broke accidentally.  What is the logic behind this opinion?
The first clause of mishnah one says that when one stumbles on a jug left in the public domain he is not obligated.  What might the law be if he broke it with intent?  Would he still be exempt or would he be obligated?
