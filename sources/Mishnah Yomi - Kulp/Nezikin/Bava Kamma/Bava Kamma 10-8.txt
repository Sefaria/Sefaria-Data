Mishnah Eight
If a man stole a lamb from the flock and restored it, but it died or was stolen again, he is responsible for it.
If the owner knew neither of its theft nor of its return and counted the flock and found it complete, the thief is exempt.  

Explanation
In section one of our mishnah a person stole a lamb from a flock and the owner noticed that it was missing.  If he were to return the lamb without telling the owner that he had done so, the thief is still responsible for the lamb.  Since he has not told the owner that the lamb has been returned the owner does not know that he has to keep an eye out for the lamb. 
In section two, the owner did not even know that the lamb was stolen.  When he counted the flock all of the animals were there, and therefore we can assume that he knew that he was responsible for them all.  If the previously stolen lamb should subsequently die or be stolen, it will be the owner’s responsibility and not the thief’s.

Questions for Further Thought:
Mishnah Seven:  Might you have thought that there would be a legal difference between a person who admits to robbing another person versus a person who admits that he received a deposit?  Why doesn’t the mishnah make a difference between these two scenarios?
Mishnah Eight:  What would be the law if in the scenario mentioned in section two the owner had not counted the flock?  Would the thief still be exempt?
