Shevuoth, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah discusses the oath taken by one who has been robbed.  Through this oath the one who was robbed can recover his money from the robber.

Mishnah Two
“He who has been robbed” — How so? 
If they testified of a man that he entered into another’s house to take a pledge without permission, and the other says, “You have taken my vessels, and he says, “I have not taken them,” he takes an oath, and takes back his vessels. 
Rabbi Judah says:  “[There is no oath] unless there is partial admission:   How so? He said to him, “You have taken two vessels,” and the other says, “I have taken only one.”

Explanation
The second type of person who is allowed to swear and collect is one who has been robbed.  In the scenario presented in the mishnah Reuven enters Shimon’s home to take Shimon’s property as a pledge against Shimon’s debt to Reuven, but Reuven did not have permission, neither from Shimon nor from the court, to do so.  Shimon claims that Reuven took his vessels when intruding into the house.  If Reuven denies having done so, Shimon may swear and take from Reuven the value of the vessels that he has claimed.  The reason that Shimon is allowed to swear and thereby collect is that Reuven is punished for having illegally entered Shimon’s house.  Since he already broke the law, we do not trust him to deny having further broken the law.  
According to Rabbi Judah, he is allowed to swear and collect only if Reuven denies part of the claim and admits to the other part.  If Reuven denies the entire claim, Shimon cannot swear and thereby collect.

Questions for Further Thought:
Why do you think that the mishnah demonstrates a person who has been robbed with the case of someone who entered someone’s house to take a pledge?  Why not demonstrate this law with a normal case of a robber?
