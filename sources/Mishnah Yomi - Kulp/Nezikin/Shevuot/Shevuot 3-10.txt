Shevuoth, Chapter Three, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
The mishnah that we will learn today contains a list of when the oath of utterance is applicable.  A similar list will appear in tomorrow’s mishnah with regard to vain oaths.  The similarities between these two types of oaths will be contrasted with the rules of the testimonial oath, to be learned in the first mishnah of chapter four.  Some of the points in these mishnayoth may seem obvious.  They are included here only to be contrasted with what we learn in chapter four mishnah one.  

Mishnah Ten
The oath of utterance applies to men and women, to relatives and non-relatives, to those qualified [to bear witness] and those not qualified, [whether uttered] before the court, or not before the court, [but it must be uttered] with a man’s own mouth.   
And he is liable, for intentional transgression, lashes, and for unintentional transgression, a sliding scale sacrifice.

Explanation
An oath of utterance equally applies to men and women.  Similarly it does not matter if the person swears concerning a relative or non-relative, one who is fit to testify or not fit to testify.  It can be uttered before or not before a court.  Again, these laws may seem obvious, but we will see in chapter four that they are different with regards to testimonial oaths.  
The oath of utterance must be uttered by the one swearing.  We will learn at the end of mishnah eleven that he may also swear by being adjured by someone else and answering amen.
The end of the mishnah reiterates the punishments for breaking an oath of utterance. The punishments for oaths of utterance and vain oaths were already taught in mishnah seven.
