Shevuoth, Chapter Two, Mishnah Four 

Introduction
Mishnah four contains a short digression which discusses the obligation of a court to bring a sacrificial bullock if they give a wrong teaching.  This subject is learned more fully in Tractate Horayoth.  This digression is found here because one of the wrongful teachings for which the court is not obligated is given as an example in mishnah three.

Mishnah Four
And which is the positive precept concerning a menstruant for which they are liable?  
[This:] if one cohabited with a [ritually] pure woman, and she said to him:  “I have become impure”, and he withdrew immediately, he is liable, because his withdrawal is as pleasant to him as his entry. 

Explanation
This mishnah continues the subject taught in section two of the previous mishnah, namely cases where the court is or is not obligated to bring a sacrifice if they gave a mistaken ruling.  In Tractate Horayoth 2:4 we will learn that if the court made a mistake with regards to the laws of menstrual purity, in either a positive or negative commandment, they must bring the sacrifice.  Our mishnah asks what is the positive commandment to which that mishnah refers. 
The answer is a case where a man was having sexual relations with a pure woman, i.e. a woman who was not menstruating.  If, while having sex she told him that she had just begun to menstruate, he has a problem, since the Torah forbids sexual relations with a menstruant (Leviticus 20:18).  Our mishnah teaches that if the court instructed him to withdraw immediately, the court has taught mistakenly and must bring a sacrifice.  This is because his withdrawal while erect is actually pleasurable for him.  Rather he is forbidden to withdraw until his erection disappears.
