Shevuoth, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Three

Introduction 
This mishnah discusses the oath taken by one who has been wounded.  Through this oath he can collect money from the one who wounded him.  

Mishnah Three
“He who has been wounded,” — How so? 
If they testified about a person that another went onto his property whole, and came out wounded, and he said to him, “You have wounded me,” and the other said, “I have not wounded you,” he takes an oath, and receives [damages]. 
R. Judah says: “[There is no oath] unless there is partial admission:   How so?  He said to him, you have inflicted on me two wounds,” and the other said, “I inflicted on you only one wound.” 

Explanation
This mishnah discusses the third example of one who swears and thereby collects:  a person who has been wounded.  In this scenario witnesses testify that Shimon entered Reuven’s property without having been previously injured and that he came out wounded.  Shimon claims that Reuven injured him and Reuven denies having done so.  Since it is highly likely that Shimon is telling the truth and that Reuven did indeed injure Shimon, Shimon may take an oath and collect damages.
Rabbi Judah states that Shimon may collect only if Reuven admits to part of the claim.  For instance if Shimon claims that Reuven injured him twice and Reuven admits to having done so only once, then Shimon may swear and collect.  This opinion of Rabbi Judah is consistent with his opinion in the two previous mishnayoth.

Questions for Further Thought: 
What would be the law if there were no witnesses who testified that Shimon went onto Reuven’s property?  Would Shimon still be able to collect?
