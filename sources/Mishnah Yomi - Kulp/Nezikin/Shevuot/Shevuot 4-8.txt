Shevuoth, Chapter Four, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah discusses one who gives falsely swears about money that one person promised to give to another.

Mishnah Eight
[If a man said,]  “I adjure you that you come and bear testimony for me that so-and-so promised to give me two hundred zuz, and did not give me”, they are exempt, for they are liable only for a money claim as [in the case of] deposit.   

Explanation
The oath of testimony is discussed in Leviticus 5:1.  Leviticus 5:21 discusses an oath a person makes to deny having received a deposit, a loan, found a lost object or a stolen an object.  The similarity in the language between these two verses led the Rabbis to conclude that although not mentioned specifically in verse 5:1 it is similar to 5:21 as it also concerns things similar to deposit.  Therefore, in order for the witnesses to be liable for a false oath of testimony they must deny knowledge of a case that is similar to the case of a deposit, where one person claims he deposited money with another.  If the case is one of a monetary promise, such as our mishnah, the false oath does not make the witnesses liable.
