Shevuoth, Chapter Six, Mishnah Two


Mishnah Two
“You have of mine a hundred denarii”, he said to him, “Yes.” 
The next day he said to him, “Give them to me”, [and he replied,] “I have given them to you,” he is exempt. 
[If he says,] “Nothing of yours is in my possession,” he is liable.   
“You have of mine a hundred denarii”, he said to him, “Yes”. [And then he said], “Do not give them to me except before witnesses.” 
The next day he said to him, “Give them to me;” [and he replied,] “I have given them to you,” he is liable, because he should have given them to him before witnesses.

Explanation
Section one:  In the first scenario, Shimon admits one day to owing Reuven a hundred denarii (a coin).  When the next day Reuven claims them, Shimon counterclaims that he has already paid him back.  In such a case Shimon is exempt since Reuven cannot prove that Shimon did not pay him back.  If, however, Shimon changes his claim from the previous day, and now denies owing Reuven money, he is liable to pay.  After having admitted to owing money on one day, he may not change his mind the next.
Section two:  If, when Shimon admits to owing money, Reuven tells him that he wants the money returned only in front of witnesses, and then the next day Shimon claims that he paid back the money, Shimon is not believed.  Since Reuven specified that he wanted the money returned in front of witnesses, the burden is now on Shimon to prove that he did pay him back. Without witnesses he will not be able to do so.

Questions for Further Thought:
Mishnah one, section four:  Why is this compared to returning a lost object?
