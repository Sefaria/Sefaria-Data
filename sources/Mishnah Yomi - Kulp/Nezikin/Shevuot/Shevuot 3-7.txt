Shevuoth, Chapter Three, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Mishnah seven concludes the mishnah’s discussion of “oaths of utterance.”

Mishnah Seven
“I swear I shall not eat this loaf”; “I swear I shall not eat it”; “I swear I shall not eat it”; and he ate it, he is liable only once. 
This is the oath of utterance, for which one is liable, for its willful transgression, flogging; and for its unwitting transgression, a sliding scale sacrifice. 
For a vain oath one is liable for willful transgression, flogging, and for unwitting transgression one is exempt.

Explanation
Section one:  If one repeats the same oath several times and then breaks the oath(s) he is only liable for having broken one oath.  Since after he made the first oath the loaf was already forbidden to him, he cannot make the same loaf any more forbidden to him.  The repeated oaths do not create any new forbidden things, and therefore they do not count.
Section two:  This is the concluding section of mishnah which began at the beginning of the chapter and which has discussed “oaths of utterance.”  For intentionally breaking an oath of utterance one is flogged and for unintentionally breaking an oath of utterance one must bring a sacrifice.  The mishnah now mentions “vain oaths” a topic which will be discussed throughout the remainder of the chapter.  For intentionally swearing a vain oath one is flogged.  There is no punishment for unintentionally swearing a vain oath.
