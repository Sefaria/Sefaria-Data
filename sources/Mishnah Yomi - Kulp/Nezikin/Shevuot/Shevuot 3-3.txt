Shevuoth, Chapter Three, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Mishnah three discusses a person who swears not to drink.  The question again is, how many different oaths did he make.


Mishnah Three
“I swear I shall not drink,” and he drank many liquids, he is liable only once. 
“I swear I shall not drink wine, oil, and honey,” and he drank [all three], he is liable for each one. 

Explanation—Mishnah Three
This mishnah teaches the same law as the previous mishnah, except it discusses drinking.  Again we learn that if he specifies what he will not drink, he has sworn (and then broken) three separate oaths and he will be obligated for three separate sacrifices.  If he makes one general oath, he will be obligated to bring only one separate sacrifice.
