Shevuoth, Chapter Six, Mishnah Four

Introduction
In mishnah four we will learn cases where an oath is not taken because of the status of the claimant or defendant. 
 
Mishnah Four
No oath is imposed in a claim by a deaf-mute, imbecile, or minor. 
And no oath is imposed on a minor.
But an oath is imposed when a claim is lodged against a minor, or against the Temple’s property.

Explanation
Section one:  If a deaf-mute, an insane person or a minor make a claim against another person, that person does not have to swear an oath.  Since the mishnah considers these people to be lacking intelligence, their claims are not trustworthy enough to impose an oath upon others.  [When we learned Bava Kamma 4:4 I discussed the mishnah’s attitude towards deaf-mutes, and how Jewish law has changed now that sign language has been developed.]
Section two:  A minor is never asked to take an oath, since he cannot understand the consequences of falsely swearing. 
Section three:  One who comes to collect a debt that a minor’s deceased father owed him, may take an oath that he is owed the money.  This is not considered a case of the minor being a defendant, but in reality the deceased’s estate is the defendant.
If Reuven owes Shimon money and then Reuven dedicates all his property to the Temple, Reuven may take an oath and collect from the property that had been dedicated to the Temple.
