Shevuoth, Chapter Four, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah continues the lists we have seen in the previous three mishnayoth.

Mishnah Two
And they are liable for intentional transgression of the oath, and for its unintentional transgression coupled with intentional [denial of knowledge of] testimony, but they are not liable for unintentional transgression.  
And what are they liable for the intentional transgression of the oath? A sliding scale sacrifice.

Explanation
There are two elements to the false oath of testimony:  1)  knowing information and intentionally withholding it; 2)  intentionally swearing falsely that one does not know the information.  The mishnah teaches that if the witnesses intentionally deny knowledge of the testimony, even if they don’t realize that swearing falsely is forbidden, they are liable for intentionally swearing falsely.  However, if they don’t realize that they know information then they are not liable, since this was a totally unintentional transgression.  In other words, there punishment hinges upon their intentional denial of knowledge of information.  If they intentionally withheld information and swore to it, then they are liable to bring a sliding scale sacrifice, as described in Leviticus 5:5-13.
