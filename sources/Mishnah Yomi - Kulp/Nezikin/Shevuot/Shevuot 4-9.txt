Shevuoth, Chapter Four, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
The mishnah continues to discuss cases that are not technically considered false oaths of testimony.
 
Mishnah Nine
“I adjure you that, when you know any testimony for me, you should come and bear testimony for me,” they are exempt, because the oath preceded the testimony.  

Explanation—Mishnah Nine
This mishnah teaches that the testimony must precede the oath.  A person may not in advance adjure witnesses that if they, in the future know any testimony for him, that they must come and testify.  The order of the verbs in Leviticus 5:1 also points to the fact that the testimony must precede the oath.
