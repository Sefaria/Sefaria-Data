Sanhedrin, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Mishnah six discusses the permission that one has to kill a thief who has tunneled into one’s home.

Mishnah Six
[The thief] who burrows his way in [to someone’s home] is judged on account of his outcome. 
If he burrowed his way in and broke a jug, should there be blood-guiltiness for him,  he must pay [for the jug], but if there is no blood-guiltiness for him, he is not liable. 

Explanation
Section one:  Exodus 22:1-2 teaches that if a householder kills a thief who has burrowed his way into his house, the householder is not guilty of murder.  Although execution is not the usual punishment for a thief, since the householder was taken by surprise and did not know the intention of the illegal intruder, he is not held liable for having killed him.  Our mishnah understands that this preemptive killing of the intruder is to prevent him from committing more sins, specifically the murder of the householder. 
Section two:  The Torah also teaches that if the thief burrowed in during the day the householder is not allowed to kill him (unless it is in self-defense).  If the householder does kill him he will be accounted guilty.  Our mishnah teaches that if the thief broke a jug while burrowing he is liable for damages only in a case where the householder was not allowed to kill him.  If, however, the householder was allowed to kill him, i.e. at night, since the thief can be executed he is not liable for monetary damages.  This is based on a common principle in Jewish law that if on account of one act one becomes liable for two punishments, he is punished by the greater of the two punishments, in this case death (see Bava Kamma 3:10).   

Questions for Further Thought:
Why do the Rabbis understand the killing of the “tunneling thief” as preventing him from committing worse crimes, as opposed to self-defense?
