Makkoth, Chapter Three, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Mishnah eight is a continuation of mishnah seven which discussed the punishment for the continuous violation of a negative commandment.

Mishnah Eight
If he has been defiling himself for the dead all day, he is liable for only one set of lashes. 
If they said to him, “Do not defile yourself! Do not defile yourself!” and he did defile himself [each time], he is liable on each instance. 
If he was shaving all day he is liable for only one set of lashes. 
If they said to him, “Do not shave, Do not shave” and he did shave [each time], he is liable on each instance. 
If he was wearing a garment of mixed linen and wool all day, he is liable for only one set of lashes. 
If they said to him, “Do not put it on!  Do not put it on!” and he takes it off and puts it on, he is liable on each instance.

Explanation
All three sections of this mishnah teach the same ruling, which we learned already in the end of mishnah seven.  If a person is violating a prohibition continuously over an entire day he is only punished for one violation.  In other words, even though he may have violated the prohibition several times, it is considered one continuous violation and he is only punished once.  However, if he is warned by others and continues to violate the prohibition he is obligated for each violation.  Since he was warned he cannot claim that he didn’t realize what he was doing.  
The first two sections deal with two of the prohibitions placed by the Torah on the nazirite:  ritually defile himself through contact with a dead body or shave his hair.  The other prohibition for the nazirite, drinking wine, was the subject of mishnah seven.
The final section of the mishnah deals with the wearing of a garment which contains wool and linen.  This is prohibited in Leviticus 19:19.
