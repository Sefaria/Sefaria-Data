Makkoth, Chapter Three, Mishnah Thirteen

Introduction
Mishnah thirteen continues to describe the whip and how the lashes are to be administered.  

Mishnah Thirteen
The handle is a handbreadth long and a handbreadth wide, its tip reaching to the edge of the [offender’s] abdomen.   
He administers one-third [of the lashes] in front and two-thirds behind.   
He lashes him not in a standing or sitting position but stooping, as it says, “And the judge shall cause him to fall [stoop] down” (Deut. 25:2).   
He who administers the lashes lashes with his one hand and with his whole force.

Explanation
Section one:  Our mishnah continues to describe the whip used for lashing.  Its handle was one handbreadth by one handbreadth.   The tip of the whip, meaning the extra straps, should be long enough to reach the offender’s abdomen when the minister strikes him.  The offender will be struck by the tip and not by the body of the whip, made of the cowhide.  
Section two:  As we learned previously, one-third of the lashes are on his front and two-thirds on his back.  The offender, when he is being lashed, is not to stand nor to sit but to lean over. This is learned from the verse which states that the judge should cause him to fall over.  The verse is understood not to mean that the judge should cause him to fall all the way down but to stoop down.  The person lashing can use only one hand but he should use all of his force.  

Questions for Further Thought:
Why do you think that two-thirds of the lashes are given on the back and one-third on the front?
