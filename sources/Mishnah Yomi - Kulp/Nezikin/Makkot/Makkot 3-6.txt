Makkoth, Chapter Three, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah is a continuation of the previous mishnah which discussed the prohibitions in Leviticus 19:27-28.

Mishnah Six
He who writes an incision on his skin [is flogged]. 
If he writes [on his flesh] without incising, or incises without writing, he is not liable, until he writes and incises with ink, eye-paint or anything that lasts. 
Rabbi Shimon ben Judah says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:  “He is not liable until he has written there the name [of a god], as it is says:  “Nor shall you incise any marks on yourselves; I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:28).

Explanation
The last half of verse Lev. 19:28 prohibits tattooing, defined in our mishnah as incising with a knife and making a permanent mark.  If he were to incise without using permanent ink, or write on himself with permanent ink without first incising he would not be liable for lashes.  
The first opinion in the mishnah understood that one is liable to be flogged no matter what he writes.  Rabbi Shimon ben Judah disagrees and states that one is obligated only if he writes the name of another god.  This is learned from the end or verse 28, “I am the Lord”.  Rabbi Shimon understands this to mean God saying, “I am the Lord” and therefore you may not write any other god’s name.  

Questions for Further Thought:
If you have the Hebrew text in front of you, you may be able to notice that the end of the mishnah can actually be read in a different way?  How else can it be read?
