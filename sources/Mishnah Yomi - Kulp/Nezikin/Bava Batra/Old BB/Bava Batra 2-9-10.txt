Bava Batra Chapter Two Mishnayoth Nine and Ten

Introduction
Mishnah nine deals with distancing foul-smelling things from a town.
Mishnah ten deals with distancing foul-smelling things from foods which might be ruined due to the smell.

Mishnah Nine
Animal carcasses, graves and tanneries must be distanced fifty cubits from a town. 
A tannery may be set up only to the east of a town.
Rabbi Akiva says:  “It may be set up on any side save the west, and it must be distanced fifty cubits [from the town].

Explanation—Mishnah Nine
The three things listed in section one, animal carcasses, graves and tanneries will potentially give off foul smells.  Therefore one had to make sure these things were kept at least fifty cubits from the town.  Furthermore, since a tannery smells so bad, it may only be set up to the east of the town.  Since easterly winds were not common in the Land of Israel, the tannery needed to be kept to the east so its smell would not be blown into the town.  Rabbi Akiva said that the tannery could also be to the north or south of the town, just not to the west.

Mishnah Ten
A pool for soaking flax must be distanced from vegetables, and leeks from onions, and mustard plant from bees.  
Rabbi Yose permits mustard plant.   

Explanation—Mishnah Ten
This simple mishnah lists things that will spoil other things if kept near them and therefore must be distanced from them.  [Note:  part of the processing of flax, a major material for clothing, was soaking it in water].  

Questions for Further Thought:
What is the relationship of Rabbi Akiva’s opinion to the anonymous opinion in mishnah nine?  Upon what does he agree and upon what does he agree?
Why does mishnah ten come after mishnah nine?
