Bava Batra, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Three

Introduction
In Numbers 27 the story is told of Zelophehad’s daughters.  Zelophehad died with no sons and his daughters came to Moses to request that they inherit Zelophehad’s property.  Moses brings the request to God who affirms that if there are no sons then the daughters are the next in the line of inheritance.  Mishnah three deals with the case of Zelophehad’s daughters.

Mishnah Three
The daughters of Zelophehad took three portions of the inheritance (of the Land of Israel):
The portion of their father who was of them that came out of Egypt;
And his portion among his brothers from the property of Hepher (Zelophehad’s father);
And, in that he (Zelophehad) was the first-born, he took a double portion.

Explanation
This mishnah lists how many portions of land the daughters of Zelophehad received.  According to the mishnah the Land of Israel was divided according to the adult males who left Egypt (and not according to those who actually arrived to the Land of Israel).  Since Zelophehad and his father, Hepher, both left Egypt, they both would have received a piece of land in Israel.  In addition, Zelophehad, being the first born, would have taken a double portion in the inheritance he received from Hepher.  These three portions, Zelophehad’s own portion and the two portions he inherited from Hepher, all would have passed down to the daughters of Zelophehad when he died.

Questions for Further Thought:
How does this mishnah connect with the subject of the previous mishnah?  In other words why is this mishnah here and not somewhere else in the chapter?
