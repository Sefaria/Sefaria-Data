Bava Batra, Chapter Four, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Mishnah five discusses what is sold with an olive press and mishnah six discusses what is sold with a bath house.

Mishnah Six
If a man sold a bath house, he has not sold the planks or the benches or the curtains.
But if he had said:  “It and all that is in it”, all these are sold also. 
In neither case has he sold the water containers or the stores of wood.

Explanation
In the first section we learn that when someone sells a bath house, the planks which serve as the floor of the bath house, the benches and the curtains are not included in the sale.  Only if he stated that he was selling all that is in the bath house are these items considered part of the sale.  In any case the water containers and stores of wood are not considered to be part of the bath house and are therefore not sold with it, even if he stated that he was selling all that is in the bath house.
