Bava Batra, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
Mishnah nine continues to deal with the topic of doubtful inheritances in which it is unclear who died first, the inheritor or the one from whom he inherits.

Mishnah Nine
If the house fell down on a man and his wife, the husband’s heirs say, “The wife died first and the husband died afterward” and the wife’s heirs say, “The husband died first and the wife died afterward”.
The School of Shammai says:  “Let them split [the property].”
The School of Hillel says:  “The property remains in its former status—the Ketubah to the husband’s heirs and the property that comes in and goes out with her to her father’s heirs.”

Explanation
In our mishnah Jacob and Rachel both died in the same accident and it is unclear who died first.  If Rachel died first then Jacob would inherit all of her property, since a husband inherits from his wife.  If Jacob inherited Rachel’s property then when he died his inheritors would inherit her (as well as his) property.  Therefore, Jacob’s inheritors claim that Rachel died first.  If, on the other hand, Jacob died first, Rachel’s inheritors would inherit her property.  (They would not inherit Jacob’s property since a wife does not inherit from her husband).  Therefore, Rachel’s inheritors claim that Jacob died first.
As in the previous mishnah the School of Shammai says that in such a case the money is to be split.  The School of Hillel again states that the money reverts back to its last verifiable owner.  The ketubah (marriage contract) money last belonged to the husband (it is his until he pays it to her) and therefore his inheritors receive that money.  The woman’s dowry which she brought into the marriage and over which the husband did not take title, belonged to the wife.  Therefore her inheritors receive this money.

Questions for Further Thought:  
How is the School of Hillel’s opinion in mishnah nine consistent with their opinion in mishnah eight?
