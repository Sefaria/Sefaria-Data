Bava Batra, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Mishnah two lists the order of the inheritance, whose inheritance takes precedence over others.

Mishnah Two
This is the order of inheritance:  “If a man dies without leaving a son, you shall transfer his property to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8)—the son precedes the daughter, and all the son’s offspring precede the daughter.  
The daughter precedes the brothers and the daughters’ offspring precede the brothers.’
Brothers precede the father’s brothers and the brothers’ offspring precede the father’s brothers.
This is the general rule:  whosoever has precedence in inheritance, his offspring also has precedence.
The father has precedence over all his offspring.

Explanation
This mishnah deals with the order of inheritance as mentioned in the verse, quoted in section one.  A son precedes a daughter in inheritance.  In addition, if the son had children they inherit even if the son is no longer alive.  In other words grandchildren inherit directly from their grandfather if the father is no longer alive. As stated in the general rule in section five, offspring in essence take the place of the supposed inheritor.  So too if the daughter has offspring and she is no longer alive, they will inherit in place of the brothers of the deceased.  If the brothers of the deceased have offspring and the brothers are no longer alive, they will inherit in place of the deceased man’s father’s brothers.  
Finally, the mishnah teaches us one other piece of information that we might have assumed from the Torah but is not explicit.  The Torah lists the father’s brothers as being on the line of inheritance but it does not list the father himself.  Our mishnah states that if a person dies without children, his or her father becomes the primary inheritor.  Likewise, if a grandchild would die with no offspring and the grandchild’s father is also not alive the grandfather would inherit from his granchild.
