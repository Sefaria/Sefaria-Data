Bava Batra, Chapter Two, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
Mishnah ten deals with distancing foul-smelling things from foods which might be ruined due to the smell.

Mishnah Ten
A pool for soaking flax must be distanced from vegetables, and leeks from onions, and mustard plant from bees.  
Rabbi Yose permits mustard plant.   

Explanation
This simple mishnah lists things that will spoil other things if kept near them and therefore must be distanced from them.  [Note:  part of the processing of flax, a major material for clothing, was soaking it in water].  

Questions for Further Thought:
Why does mishnah ten come after mishnah nine?
