Bava Batra, Chapter Seven, Mishnah One

Introduction
The seventh chapter of Bava Batra deals with errors in the measurement of fields discovered after they were sold. The question asked is must the buyer return the error to the seller if the seller gave more than the stated amount and vice versa, may the buyer demand that the seller give more land if the land was less than the stated amount.

Mishnah One
If a man said to his fellow, “I will sell you a kor’s space of soil”, and it contained crevices ten handbreadths deep or rocks ten handbreadths high, these are not included in the measurement.
But if they were less than this they are included.
If he said to him, “About a kor’s space of soil”, even if it contained crevices deeper than ten handbreadths or rocks higher than ten handbreadths, they are included in the measurement.

Explanation
According to our mishnah if a person promises to sell exactly a kor’s space of soil (about 20,000 square meters) then any crevices which are lower than ten handbreadths or rocks higher than ten handbreadth’s are not counted as part of the field.  Since they cannot be used for planting, they do not contribute to the measure of a kor’s space of soil.  However, if he sold him “about a kor’s space of soil” these rocks and crevices are included.  Since he didn’t say that he was selling precisely a kor’s space of soil the measurements do not have to be precise.
