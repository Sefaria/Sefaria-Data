Bava Batra, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Mishnah four deals with the difference between the inheritance of the son and the daughter.

Mishnah Four
The son and the daughter are alike concerning inheritance, save that the [firstborn] son takes a double portion of the father’s property but he does not take a double portion of the mother’s property.
And the daughters receive maintenance from the father’s property but not from the mother’s property.

Explanation
This mishnah lists the differences between sons and daughters with regards to inheritance.  (Note: daughters only inherit when there are no sons).  The first difference is that the eldest son inherits the double portion, whereas the eldest daughter would inherit equally with younger sisters.  Furthermore, the son inherits a double portion of his father’s inheritance but not of his mother’s inheritance.  The law of the double portion are found in Deuteronomy 21:15.
If a man should die and leave sons and daughters, the sons inherit the estate but the minor daughters are maintained, i.e. fed, clothed, housed and in general provided for, by the estate of the deceased father.  We will learn this principle in chapter nine.  Here the mishnah states that the daughters, when receiving maintenance payments, receive them only from the estate of the father and not from the estate of the mother.

Section one is actually worded in a somewhat difficult manner.  What makes it difficult?
