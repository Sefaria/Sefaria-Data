Bava Batra, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Mishnah three continues to deal with the measurement of fields for purposes of selling.

Mishnah Three
[If he said], “I will sell you [a piece of land] as measured by the rope, whether it is less or more” the condition “whether it is less or more” makes void the condition “as measured by the rope”.
[And if he said], “Be it less or more, as measured by the rope”, the condition “as measured by the rope” makes void the condition “be it less or more”, according to Ben Nanas.
[If he said, I will sell you a piece of land] by its marks and its boundaries”, and the difference was less than a sixth, the sale stands.  
If it was as much a sixth the buyer may reduce the price.

Explanation
Section one:  In the scenario mentioned in both clauses of section one, the seller uses contradictory language when selling the field.  As we learned in mishnah two, when the seller says that he is selling “as measured by the rope”, the intention is that the measurement be precise.  On the other hand, if he says, “whether it is less or more” the intention is that the measurement will not necessarily be precise.  According to our mishnah if he said both languages within one sentence the last language voids the first language.  In other words, we assume that when he said the last language he intended to change his mind from the first language.  Therefore the case will be adjudicated only based on the last language.
Section two:  If a person sold a piece of land using its marks and boundaries as indicators to the place of the land, there is an allowance of up to one-sixth error.  Beyond that, meaning more than one sixth error, the buyer may reduce the price if the error was to the seller’s favor (i.e. the land was smaller than stated).  Alternatively, the buyer will return money or the property to the seller, if the error was to the buyer’s favor (i.e. the land was larger than stated).
