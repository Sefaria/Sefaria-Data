Mishnah Two
If there was a house (the first story) and an upper room (the second story) belonging to two people, and the [floor of the] upper room broke and the owner of the house (the bottom story) did not want to fix it, the owner of the upper room may come down and dwell below, until the owner [of the bottom story] fixes [the floor of the] upper room.
Rabbi Yose says:  “He that dwells below should provide the beams and he that dwells above the plastering.

Explanation
As in the previous mishnah, in mishnah two one person owns the bottom story and another owns the top story.  However, here, instead of the whole building collapsing as occurred in mishnah one, the ceiling of the bottom story, which also serves as the floor of the top story collapses.  According to the first opinion in the mishnah the owner of the bottom story is obligated to fix the ceiling/floor and until he does so the owner of the top story may occupy the bottom story.  Rabbi Yose disagrees and states that the two partners must share in the building of the ceiling/floor.  The owner of the bottom story provides the wooden beams and the owner of the top provides the plaster.  

Questions for Further Thought:
Mishnah one:  Why would you think that the stones which one of the owners recognizes does not count as part of his share?  In other words, why might the last statement of the mishnah not be obvious?
Mishnah two:  What is the basis of Rabbi Yose’s disagreement with the first opinion?  Why doesn’t Rabbi Yose think that the owner of the bottom floor should be responsible for providing the entire ceiling/floor?
