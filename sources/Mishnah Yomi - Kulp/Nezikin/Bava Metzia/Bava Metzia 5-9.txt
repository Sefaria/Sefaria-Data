Mishnah Nine
One should not say to his fellow, “Lend me a kor of wheat and I will repay you at the threshing time”, but he may say, “Lend it to me until my son comes”, or “until I find my key”.
But Hillel used to forbid this.
Moreover Hillel used to say, “A woman may not lend a loaf of bread to her neighbor unless she determines its value in money, lest wheat should rise in price and they are found to be engaging in usury.”

Explanation
Section one:  As we learned in the previous mishnah one cannot lend wheat and ask to receive the same amount of wheat in the future lest the wheat rise in price.  If, however, the borrower has other wheat at the time he borrows from the other person, then it is permitted.  The reason that this is permitted is that the borrower could have repaid the wheat immediately after receiving the loan before the price might potentially rise.  The mishnah states that the borrower may say “loan me some wheat and I will repay you wheat as soon as my son comes to open my storehouse or I find the key to my storehouse”, where assumedly the borrower has wheat.
Section two:  Hillel was stricter in this matter and forbid this type of loan even if the borrower has wheat in his possession.  Hillel forbid even a casual loan of a loaf of bread from one woman to her neighbor unless she set a price in money.  Again, Hillel is concerned that the price of wheat would rise and she would receive interest in return for giving her bread to her friend. 

Questions for Further Thought:
Why would the mishnah teach a stringency that Rabban Gamaliel accepted upon himself if it is not obligatory upon others?
What is the difference between Rabban Gamaliel and Hillel?
