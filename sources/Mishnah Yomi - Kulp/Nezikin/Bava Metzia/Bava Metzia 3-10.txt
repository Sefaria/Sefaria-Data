Mishnah Ten 
If a man left money in his fellow’s keeping and his fellow bound it up and hung it over his back, or delivered it to his son or his daughter who were minors, or locked it up improperly, he is liable since he did not guard in the way of guardians.
If he guarded it in the way of guardians he is exempt.

Explanation
This mishnah teaches how a person should guard another person’s given to him for safekeeping.  He should not tie it up and put it in a bundle behind him lest a thief come and take it.  He should not give it to minor children nor lock it up improperly.  All of these are not the way that guardians watch other people’s objects.  If he should act in such a manner and the money were to be lost he would be liable.  If, however, he guarded it properly and something happened to the money, he would be exempt.

Questions for Further Thought:
Mishnah ten:  Why does the mishnah need to teach the idea of “the way of guardians”?  Why not just state that the guardian is either liable or not liable? What additional information might we glean from these words?
