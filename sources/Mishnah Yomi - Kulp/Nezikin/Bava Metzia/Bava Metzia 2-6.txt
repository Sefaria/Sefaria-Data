Mishnah Six
For how long must a man proclaim [what he has found]?
Until all of his neighbors know of it, according to Rabbi Meir.
Rabbi Judah says:  “At the three Pilgrimage Festivals and for seven days after the lest festival, to allow him three days to go back to his house, three days to return and one day on which to proclaim his loss.”

Explanation
According to Rabbi Meir a person must proclaim the lost objects until all of his neighbors know.  Rabbi Judah’s suggestion reflects a law that would have been most applicable when the Temple in Jerusalem stood.  When the Temple stood people would come to Jerusalem to proclaim and claim there lost items, no matter where they were lost.  It was assumed that a person would come on at least one of the three Pilgrimage Festivals, Sukkot, Pesach and Shavuoth.  Therefore the item should be proclaimed for these three festivals.  In addition, there were seven days added after the end of the last festival to give the person a chance to go home, check to see if he had lost the object and then to return to Jerusalem to claim the lost item.      

Questions for Further Thought:
Mishnah five:  According to the criteria listed in the mishnah what types of items in our society would need to be proclaimed and which would not?
Mishnah six:  How do people proclaim lost items in our society?  How does that differ from the way they would do it in Mishnaic times?
