Bava Metziah, Chapter One, Mishnayoth One and Two

Introduction
The first two mishnayoth of Bava Metzia deal with cases where two people both claim ownership over an object which they are jointly holding.

Mishnah One
If two people are grasping a cloak:  One says, “I found it” and the other says, “I found it”, or one says “It’s all mine”, and the other says, “It’s all mine”, they each swear that they don’t own more than half of the cloak and they split the cloak.
(If) one says, “It’s all mine” and the other says, “It’s half mine”, the one who says, “It’s all mine” swears that he doesn’t own less than ¾ and the one who says “It’s half mine” swears that he doesn’t own less than ¼, and the former takes ¾ and the latter takes ¼.

Explanation
This Mishnah describes the common situation in which two people claim ownership of an article and neither can prove that it belongs to him.  If they were to bring witnesses the judges would rule according to their testimony.  In the absence of witnesses the judges must rule based on other assumptions.  The means of ensuring that the person was telling the truth was in many cases, including this one, an oath.  One should note that oaths were taken extremely seriously by Jews in ancient times and the assumption is that one would not swear falsely.  Therefore taking an oath is a strong deterrent to lying.
