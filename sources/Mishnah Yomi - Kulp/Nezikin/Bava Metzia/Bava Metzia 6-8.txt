Mishnah Eight
If one moved a jar from place to place and broke it, whether he is a paid guardian or an unpaid guardian, he may take an oath [that he did not break it through neglect and be exempt from liability].
Rabbi Eliezer says:  “[I too have heard that] in either case he may take an oath, but I wonder whether in either case the oath is valid.”

Explanation
The subject of our mishnah is one who breaks a jar while moving it from place to place, evidently by tripping while carrying it.  According to the opinion in the first clause of the mishnah the one carrying the object is exempt from paying and need only take an oath that he did not break it through neglect.  According to this opinion tripping is not necessarily a neglectful act.  
Rabbi Eliezer agrees that the accepted law is as was stated in the first clause but he questions the logic of that law.  According to Rabbi Eliezer tripping is indeed a neglectful act, and therefore one who tripped should not be able to take an oath that he was not neglectful.  
Note that with regards to this law it does not matter whether the carrier was a paid or unpaid guardian.  If tripping is neglectful then both are liable and if tripping is not neglectful then neither are liable.  
 
Questions for Further Thought:
Mishnah six:  Why does a craftsman have the status of an unpaid guardian after he says, “Take what is yours and give me the money”?
Mishnah eight:  Why does Rabbi Eliezer say that he has heard that either may take an oath but then doubt whether such an oath is acceptable? What does this statement teach us about Rabbi Eliezer’s general approach to tradition versus logic?
