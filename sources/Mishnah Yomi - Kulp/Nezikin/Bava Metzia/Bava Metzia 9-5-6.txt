Bava Metziah, Chapter Nine, Mishnayoth Five and Six

Introduction
Mishnah five deals with a sharecropper whose crops are not ruined but nevertheless produce an extremely low yield.  The question is asked must the sharecropper harvest the crop even though the effort will not be worth the yield.  
Mishnah six deals with a sharecropper’s liability to uphold his share in the rental agreement when his crops are ruined by either locusts or strong winds.  

Mishnah Five
If one leased a field from his fellow and it was not fruitful, if there was enough produce to make a heap, he must still tend to it.
Rabbi Judah says:  “What type of measure is a ‘heap’?  Rather, [he must tend to it] only if it yields as much grain as was sown there.”

Explanation—Mishnah Five
In mishnah three we discussed a sharecropper who decided not to care for the field at all.  In mishnah five we learn of a sharecropper who did plant the field with grain as he was supposed to, but the crops did not produce enough of a yield for it to be worthwhile for him to harvest them.  The question is asked must the sharecropper nevertheless toil to give back to the owner of the field something, even if it is a small amount, or is he allowed to not harvest the field.  According to the first opinion in the mishnah, as long as there is enough produce in the field to make a heap of grain he must harvest it.  Even though for the sharecropper this will not be worthwhile for his labor is worth more than the value of crops harvested, he must nevertheless do so, so that he can give the owner his percentage.  Rabbi Judah states that a “heap” is not a fixed enough measure, since it is not relative to the amount planted.  In other words, a large field that produces a heap is not to be treated the same as a small field which produces a heap.  Instead, according to Rabbi Judah, as long as there is enough produce in the field to replicate the grain that was sown there, the sharecropper must harvest it.  In other words the needed yield is relative to the amount sown.

Mishnah Six
If one leased a field from his fellow and the locusts devoured the crop or it was blasted [by strong winds which caused the grain to be prematurely separated from the stalks], if it was a region-wide mishap he may reduce the amount of the rental agreement.
If it was not a region-wide mishap, he may not reduce the amount of the rental agreement.
Rabbi Judah says: “If he had leased it from him for a fixed amount of money, in neither case may he reduce the amount of the rental agreement.”

Explanation—Mishnah Six
In the scenario in our mishnah, the sharecropper’s crops are destroyed by either locusts or strong winds.  If the sharecropper had promised to give the owner a percentage of the crops, then he may continue to do so, even if it turns out that the owner received nothing.  This scenario is not even discussed in our mishnah.  If, however, he promised the owner a fixed amount in return, in either crops or money, he will have a problem, since he did not grow enough crops to pay back the owner.  This is the scenario discussed in the mishnah.  According to the mishnah, if the locusts or the strong winds effected the entire region he may reduce the amount paid back.  If, however, the locusts or strong winds effected only his field, he must still pay the owner back the full amount.
According to Rabbi Judah, if the amount owed to the owner was fixed in money and not in crops, then the sharecropper must pay his full share in any case, even if the crops were destroyed by a region-wide plague.  Since the money is considered to be separate from the field, it is unaffected by what happens to the field.  

Questions for Further Thought:
Mishnah five:  Why does Rabbi Judah say that for the sharecropper to be obligated to harvest the field the field must yield as much grain as was used to seed the field?  What is the significance of such an amount?  How does this differ from the opinion in the first clause? 
Mishnah six:  Why is the sharecropper allowed to reduce the payments to the owner only if it was a region wide problem that ruined his crops?  What might the mishnah be suspicious of if the locusts or winds ruined only his crops?
