Bava Metziah, Chapter Seven, Mishnayoth Four and Five

Introduction
The two mishnayoth which we will learn today continue to discuss a worker’s right to eat from the produce with which he is working.

Mishnah Four
If one was working with figs he may not eat grapes, and if among grapes he may not eat figs.
But he may refrain [from eating] until he reaches the best produce and then eat.
In no case have they said [that he may eat] save during the time of his work.
But because of the principle of restoring lost property to its owner they have said, “Field laborers may eat as they go from one furrow to another or as they return from the winepress.  And a donkey [may eat] while it is unloading.”

Explanation
Section one:  As we learned in the previous mishnah, according to the Rabbinic interpretation of the Torah a fieldworker is allowed to eat from the food in the field while he is working in the field.  Our mishnah teaches that a worker may eat only of the food with which he is working.  They may not eat of other foods even if they belong to the same owner.  However, the worker may save his appetite and eat from the best fruit which he will work with in the end.  In other words the worker may eat of any of the fruit with which he is working but he may not eat from anything with which he is not working.
Section two:  The basic law is that a worker may only eat while he is working.  However, this situation presents a potential problem to both the worker and the employer. The worker would probably prefer to eat when he is completed with his work and the employer, who probably is paying per hour, would prefer the worker not stop working to eat.  Therefore, the Rabbis stated that workers may wait to eat until they have completed their work and are going from one place of work to the other.
