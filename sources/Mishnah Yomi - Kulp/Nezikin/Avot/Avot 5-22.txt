Avoth, Chapter Five, Mishnah Twenty-Two

Introduction
According to legend, Ben Bag Bag and Ben He He (the author of the next mishnah) were converts.  In order to hide them from the Roman authorities who forbade conversion, they were called by nicknames (these are obviously not real names).  Both nicknames are in essence the letter “heh”, which is the letter that was added to Sarai and Avram’s, the first two converts, names.  Bag Bag is in gematria (numerical value) five (bet is two and gimmel is three), which is equivalent to He He, the fifth letter of the Hebrew alphabet.  The language of the next two mishnayoth is Aramaic, as are the sayings of Hillel that we saw in chapter one, mishnah thirteen.  It is possible that these two sages are from the same time period as Hillel. 

Mishnah Twenty-Two
Ben Bag Bag said:  
Turn it over, and [again] turn it over, for all is therein.    
And look into it; 
And become gray and old therein;    
And do not move away from it, for you have no better portion than it.

Explanation
Ben Bag Bag’s four statements all refer to the study of Torah.  The first statement teaches that one should continuously study Torah, turning it over and over, for all wisdom is contained in it.  He also comes to warn man not to be satisfied with superficial learning of the Torah.  Rather he must study it over many times to delve into its deeper meanings.  
One should continue to look into Torah even after he has gotten old.  Torah study does not end in youth but is a lifelong endeavor.
One should not leave the Torah for there is nothing better in the world than the study of Torah.  
This mishnah is a quintessential example of how precious the study of Torah was in the eyes of the rabbis. It is one of the most studied books in human history and no people has ever developed such a devotion to the study of texts as have the Jews.
