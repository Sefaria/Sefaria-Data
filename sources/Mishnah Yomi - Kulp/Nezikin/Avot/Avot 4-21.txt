Avoth, Chapter Four, Mishnah Twenty-One

Introduction
Rabbi Elazar Ha-kappar was one of the last of the tannaim.  One interesting note is that this name was found in the Galilee written on a lintel piece dated to the mishnaic period.  While we cannot be certain that this refers to the same person who is named in the mishnah, it is likely that this was from his residence.

Mishnah Twenty-One
Rabbi Elazar Ha-kappar said: envy, lust and [the desire for] honor put a man out of the world.   

Explanation
This saying is parallel to the saying of Rabbi Joshua which we saw in mishnah 2:11, “Rabbi Joshua said: an evil eye, the evil inclination, and hatred for humankind put a person out of the world.”  It may even be that Rabbi Elazar is interpreting Rabbi Joshua’s statement.  An evil eye causes a person to be envious, lustfulness comes from the evil inclination and hatred for humankind stems from an overwhelming desire to rise above everyone else, hence a pursuit of honor.  
These things “put a man out of the world”, meaning they interfere with his ability to function in this world and they cause him to lose entrance into the world to come.
