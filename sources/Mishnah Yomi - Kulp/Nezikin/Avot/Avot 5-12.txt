Avoth, Chapter Five, Mishnah Twelve

Mishnah
There are four types of disciples: 
Quick to comprehend, and quick to forget:  his gain disappears in his loss; 
Slow to comprehend, and slow to forget: his loss disappears in his gain; 
Quick to comprehend, and slow to forget: he is a wise man;   
Slow to comprehend, and quick to forget, this is an evil portion.

Explanation
If you belong to the first category of this mishnah, you will quickly grasp that you belong to the first category, but you will quickly forget what you just realized.  Your quick comprehension will be meaningless for you will not retain what you have comprehended.
If you belong to the second category, you may have to read this mishnah over many times before you understand that you are actually in this category.  However, once you finally understand, you won’t forget it.  Your slow comprehension is compensated by your strong memory, and in the end you are left with a gain.
If you belong to the third category, congratulations, you are lucky to be so wise.
If you belong to the fourth category, this mishnah will take you a long time to comprehend, and then you will forget it anyway.  It is too bad that you have not been blessed with either quick comprehension or a good memory, but don’t give up hope.  You will have to work harder to learn but the mishnah has already taught us that “according to the effort is the reward”.  Since you will have to make a great effort to learn, at least your reward will be commensurate.
