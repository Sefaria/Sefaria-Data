Avoth, Chapter Four, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight
He used to say: judge not alone, for none may judge alone save one.   
And say not “accept my view”, for they are free but not you.  

Explanation
According to the rabbis, the Torah does permit an expert judge to judge alone.  Nevertheless, Rabbi Ishmael warns judges not to do so, for only God can truly judge alone.  Human beings, even those who are expert in law, should set up courts of three, as is described in Sanhedrin, chapter three.
When this expert judge is sitting with two others, and they disagree with his decision, he may not say to them “accept my view”.  He may not use force, even verbal force, to get them to acquiesce to his own view.  
“For they are free but not you”, means that since they are the majority, they may compel you to accept their, majority decision.  You, even though an expert, cannot compel them to accept your, minority decision.
