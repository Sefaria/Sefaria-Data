Avoth, Chapter Five, Mishnah Twenty-Three

Introduction
In the previous mishnah we learned that one must continuously study Torah.  In our mishnah Ben He He adds that one must work hard at Torah study in order to gain the greater reward of true understanding.

Mishnah Twenty-Three
Ben He He said: According to the labor is the reward.

Explanation
This might remind us of the modern saying, “no pain, no gain.”  The difference between the two statements is that the mishnah refers to study whereas our modern saying refers to physical exercise.  
Wisdom which is acquired with great labor will last longer than that which is acquired through casual reading.  We might experience this if we notice that things upon which we are tested are easier to remember than the casual reading we might do on our own.
