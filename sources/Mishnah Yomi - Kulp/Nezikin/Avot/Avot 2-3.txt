Avoth, Chapter Two, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Another statement by Rabban Gamaliel the son of Rabbi Judah Hanasi.

Mishnah Three
Be careful [in your dealings] with the ruling authorities for they do not befriend a person except for their own needs; they seem like friends when it is to their own interest, but they do not stand by a man in the hour of his distress.

Explanation
This is the second time in Avoth that we have seen a warning to be careful in dealing with the ruling authorities.  The first time was Shemaiah’s statement in 1:10: “love work, hate acting the superior, and do not attempt to draw near to the ruling authority.”  According to Midrash Shmuel, Rabban Gamaliel is adding on to this statement.  One should “love work”, only when it is accompanied with Torah (see the previous mishnah).  One need not avoid all positions of leadership, only those that are not for the sake of Heaven.  Finally, Rabban Gamaliel realized that it is impossible to totally avoid the ruling authorities, but one should at least be careful, for they only look out for their own interest.  
This mishnah might connect to the previous mishnah, in that a person who has communal responsibilities will often find himself dealing with politicians.
