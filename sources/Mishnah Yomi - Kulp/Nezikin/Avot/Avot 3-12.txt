Avoth, Chapter Three, Mishnah Twelve

Introduction
Rabbi Ishmael was a regular disputant with Rabbi Akiva.  His teachers were Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua.  From Rabbi Nahuniah haKaneh he learned his midrashic methodology, for which he later became famous.  His midrashic formula are still recited everyday by those who follow a traditional siddur (prayer book).  
In our mishnah Rabbi Ishmael discusses how one should act with other people of different social strata.  

Mishnah Twelve
Rabbi Ishmael said: be suppliant to a superior, submissive under compulsory service, and receive every man happily.

Explanation
Be suppliant to a superior:  According to Rabbi Ishmael, when one stands in the presence of a superior, he should consider himself inferior and serve him as he requests.  
Submissive under compulsory service:  If a person is called up by the government for compulsory service he should not resist.  
Note that I have translated this clause according to the explanation of Albeck.  The word for “compulsory service”, tishchoret, is an unusual word and is interpreted differently by others.  Some interpret the word to mean the young.  The interpretation is that when with young people, although one does not need to be suppliant with them, one should still treat them with respect.  
Receive every man happily:  This is similar to Shammai’s statement above in 1:15.
