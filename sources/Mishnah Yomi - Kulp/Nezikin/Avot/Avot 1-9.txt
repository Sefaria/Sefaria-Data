Avoth, Chapter One, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
This mishnah contains the teaching of Shimon ben Shetach, the second of the third pair.  Shimon ben Shetach lived during the rule of Alexander Janneus and his wife Shelomith.  Shimon was Shelomithâ€™s brother.  According to a legend found in both Josephus and the Babylonian Talmud (with some differences) the king killed many of the Pharisaic sages, but Shimon ben Shetach managed to escape.  Through the aid of his sister he was able to return to Jerusalem and rejoin the Sanhedrin, which had been filled in the meanwhile with Sadducees.  Along with Judah ben Tabbai, who had escaped to Egypt, they were successful in restoring the Pharisees to their place in the Sanhedrin.  That may be why both of these pairs are so concerned with the behavior of judges.

Mishnah Nine
Shimon ben Shetach  used to say: be thorough in the interrogation of witnesses, and be careful with your words, lest from them they learn to lie.  

Explanation
Shimon ben Shetach continues to give instructions to the judges.  The first statement is self-explanatory.  The second statement means that the judge should be careful while examining the witnesses, lest he inadvertently teach them how to help one side win the case.
