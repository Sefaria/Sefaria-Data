Avoth, Chapter Two, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This saying of Hillel’s is in Aramaic, as was his saying in chapter one, mishnah thirteen.  Note that what in English requires 18 words, requires in Aramaic only six.   

Mishnah Six
Moreover he saw a skull floating on the face of the water. 
He said to it: because you drowned others, they drowned you.  And in the end, they that drowned you will be drowned.  

Explanation
This mishnah expresses Hillel’s deep faith in the ultimate justice of the world.  In the end everyone receives not only a punishment for their crimes, but the exact punishment that fits their crimes.  The person who drowned others is not only punished by being killed as a murderer, but he receives the same type of death that he meted out to others.  
Although this may seem to be a statement purely of faith, one not empirically observable, Maimonides points out that it is borne out by experience all of the time and in all places.  People who do evil and introduce violence and corruption into society, fall eventually as victims to the very violence that they perpetuated.  

Questions for Further Thought:
Do you think that there is any specific symbolism to the skull and water?  If so, what?
