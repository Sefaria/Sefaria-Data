Avoth, Chapter Two, Mishnah Eleven

Mishnah Eleven
Rabbi Joshua said: an evil eye, the evil inclination, and hatred for humankind put a person out of the world.

Explanation
Rabbi Joshua lists three things that “put a man of the world”.  The first is an evil eye, which was already mentioned by Rabbi Joshua as the worst human quality in mishnah nine.  One who has an “evil eye” is one who is constantly begrudging others what they have.  One who loses control over his “evil inclination” is one who follows all of his base instincts and has no control over himself.  “Hatred for humankind” means that he hates others for no reason.  According to Rabbi Joshua all of these things “put a person of the world”.  An interesting way of explaining this mishnah is that it describes the downward moral spiral of a deteriorating human being.  He begins by being constantly jealous of what others have.  This leads him to stumble upon his evil inclination, for he may actually take what others have.  By giving in to his evil inclination he will begin to hate the entire world, and in essence he will not be part of the civilized world.
