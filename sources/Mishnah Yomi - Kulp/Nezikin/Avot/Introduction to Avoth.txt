Introduction to Avoth
	As you will immediately notice, Avoth is a unique tractate of Mishnah.  Instead of transmitting halachic disputes between the sages, it transmits ethical sayings about varying subjects such as how to interact with others, how to create a just society and especially how to lead a life of Torah and mitzvoth.  
	With all of the other tractates that we have learned until now I have strove to explain in a “peshat” (simple reading) sense.  If there were several potential such readings, then I usually presented one and occasionally two.  However, I do believe that for most mishnayoth there is a “peshat”.  With Avoth this may not be true.  Many of these statements can be understood in varying ways, and they don’t necessarily disagree with each other.  I will therefore present one, two or sometimes three different ways of understanding any given statement, but this certainly does not mean that other understandings are less correct.  
	There are numerous commentaries on Avoth, both medieval and modern, and many of the great Talmudic commentators and medieval philosophers composed commentaries on Avoth.  There are many works in English on Avoth and I would encourage you to use them while we learn.  In order to keep my commentary brief, one or two pages per mishnah, I will not present the interpretations of all of these commentaries, and when I do present their interpretations I will abbreviate.  I also do not always mention whose commentary I am using.  The two works that I have used most frequently are Kahati’s commentary on the mishnah and a book by Judah Goldin called “The Living Talmud”, in which he culls from the classic commentators and translates them into English.  Finally, there is a post-Talmudic work called “Avoth de-Rabbi Nathan” which is an expansion and explication of Avoth.  I will occasionally bring traditions from Avoth de-Rabbi Nathan which help explain Avoth.
