Avodah Zarah, Chapter Five, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
This mishnah returns to the discussion of yen nesekh that falls into a larger quantity of permitted wine.

Mishnah Ten
If yen nesekh fell into a vat, the whole of it is prohibited for use. 
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: the whole of it may be sold to non-Jews with the exception of [a quantity corresponding to] the value of the yen nesekh in it.

Explanation
This mishnah contains a dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel and the anonymous mishnah with regards to the prohibition of a mixture of yen nesekh and permitted wine.  According to the first section in the mishnah it is forbidden to derive any benefit from even a mixture of yen nesekh and other wine.  In essence, the wine must be thrown away.  According to Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, the Jew may remove a quantity of wine from the mixture that corresponds to the quantity of yen nesekh which fell in, and the rest he may sell to a non-Jew.  In this way he is not deriving any financial benefit from yen nesekh.     

Questions for Further Thought:
Compare Rabban Shimon ben Gamalielâ€™s opinion to that of Rabbi Eliezer in 3:9.  What are the similarities and differences?  Why in the case of the yen nesekh is he not allowed to drink the wine after having taken out the quantity of yen nesekh which fell in?
