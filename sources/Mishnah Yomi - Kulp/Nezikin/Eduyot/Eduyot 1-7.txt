Eduyoth, Chapter One, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah begins to list disputes between Beth Shammai (the school of Shammai) and Beth Hillel (the school of Hillel).  The rest of the chapter will contain disputes between these two schools.  

Mishnah Seven
Beth Shammai says: “A quarter-kav of any bones, even from two limbs or from three.”   
And Beth Hillel says: “A quarter-kav of bones from a corpse, either from [the bones which form] the greater portion of the [body’s] build, or from the greater portion of the number [of the body’s bones]. 
Shammai says:  “Even from a single bone.”

Explanation
Numbers 19:14 teaches that if a person dies in a tent things that are in the tent, including the people, can become impure, even though they have not touched the dead body.  Our mishnah discusses how many bones must be in the tent for them to be considered a dead body which will cause ritual impurity.  
According to Beth Shammai, a quarter-kav of bones will transmit impurity, as long as they come from at least two or three different bones.  Beth Hillel agrees that a quarter-kav of bones is enough to cause impurity but they state that the bones must either come from the greater portion of the body (the hips, thighs, rib cage and spine) or from a majority of the number of bones in the body, considered to be 248.  If there is a quarter-kav but they come from only one limb or many limbs but not a majority of the number or from the greater portion, they do not transmit impurity.
Shammai himself is even stricter than Beth Shammai, for he holds that a quarter-kav from one bone transmits impurity.
