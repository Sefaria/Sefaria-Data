Eduyoth, Chapter Three, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Mishnah eight contains another case in which one Sage declares something pure and the other Sages declare it impure.

Mishnah Eight 
Three things Rabbi Zadok pronounces [liable to receive] impurity and the Sages pronounce them not [liable to receive]: 
The nail of the money-changer;
And the chest of grist makers; 
And the nail of a stone dial.   
Rabbi Zadok pronounces [liable to receive] impurity and the Sages pronounce them not [liable to receive].

Explanation
Rabbi Zadok and the Sages disagree with regards to the liability of three items to receive impurity.  Again, in order to receive impurity something must be considered “a vessel”, which in the Mishnah can include any manmade usable object which a has a specified purpose to it.  According to Rabbi Zadok the items listed in our mishnah fit the definition of “vessel” whereas according to the Sages, they do not.
The items are:
The nail of a money-changer.  According to Maimonides, this was the nail used to hang the scales that the money-changer would use to weigh the money.
The chest used by a grist-maker to store the grist.  Others explain that this is the nail of a chest used by a grist-maker, which is used to attach the chest to a wagon to bring the grist to market.  If this is the correct explanation, then our mishnah lists three different types of nails.
The nail used to measure time in a sundial.
