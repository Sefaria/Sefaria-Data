   	Mishnah  . RABBI Eliezer said:   I have heard that when they built the temple   They made hangings for the temple and hangings for the temple-courts; but in the case of the temple they built   From the Outside,   And in the case of the temple-court they built from the inside. RABBI Joshua said: i have heard that sacrifices may be offered even though there is no temple, and that the most holy sacrifices   May be eaten even though there are no hangings, and The lesser holy sacrifices   And second tithes even though there is no wall;   Because the first sanctification   Was valid both for its own time and for the time hereafter.

   	Mishnah  . RABBI Joshua said: i have received a tradition from rabban johanan b. Zakkai, who heard it from his teacher, and his teacher [heard it] from his teacher, as a halachah [given] to moses from sinai,   That elijah   Will not come to pronounce unclean or to pronounce clean, to put away or to bring near,   But to put away those Brought near by force and to bring near those put away by force. The family of Beth zerephah   Was on the other side of the jordan. And ben zion   Put it away by force; and yet another family   Was there, and ben zion brought it near by force. Such like elIjah will come to pronounce unclean or to pronounce clean, to put away or to bring near. RABBI Judah says: to bring near, but not to put away.   RABBI Shimon says: to conciliate disputations.   And the sages say neither to put away nor to bring near, but to make Peace in the world,   For it is said,   Behold i send to you elijah the prophet, etc., And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers.
