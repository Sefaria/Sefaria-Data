Eduyoth, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Two

Introduction
According to Leviticus 11:22, it is permitted to eat certain types of locusts.  However, there are some types of locusts that are forbidden to eat.  In the time of the mishnah people were able to distinguish between permitted and forbidden locusts.  Nowadays, we do not know the difference and therefore Jews do not eat locusts.  I’m sure we are all deeply disappointed.
Our mishnah discusses the liquid that comes out of locusts when they have been preserved through salting.  

Mishnah Two
Rabbi Zadok testified concerning brine of unclean locusts that it is clean, 
Whereas the first mishnah [said]:   unclean locusts that have been preserved together with clean locusts do not make their brine unfit.

Explanation
Section one:  Rabbi Zadok teaches that the liquid that oozes out of unclean locusts when they have been salted is not considered a liquid that makes that with which it comes into contact receptive to impurities.  (See Leviticus 11:38).  The only liquids that do so are dew, water, wine, oil, blood, milk and bee’s honey (see tractate Makhshirin 6:4).  Likewise, it is permitted to drink this liquid, since it is not considered to be the blood of the locust.
Section two:  The earlier mishnah, which existed before Rabbi Zadok taught something slightly different.  It taught that if unclean locusts were preserved, meaning pickled, with clean (edible) locusts, the it is permitted to drink the brine.  Rabbi Zadok has added that even the liquid that oozes out of just unclean locusts, and not a mixture, is permitted to drink.

Questions for Further Thought:
What is the relationship of Rabbi Zadok to the “first mishnah”?
