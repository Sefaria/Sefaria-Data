Mishnah Ten
One who exchanges a sela from second tithe in Jerusalem:   
Beth Shammai says: “Copper coin for the whole sela.”
And Beth Hillel says: “Silver for one shekel and copper coin for one shekel.” 
The disputants before the Sages say: “Silver for three denars and copper coin for one denar.” 
Rabbi Akiva says: “Silver for three denars and for the fourth silver, copper coin.”   
Rabbi Tarfon says: “Four aspers in silver.” 
Shammai says: “He must leave it in the shop and eat on the credit thereof.”

Explanation
This mishnah discusses the person who arrives in Jerusalem with his silver sela of second tithe and wishes to exchange it for copper coins so that he can buy small quantities of food.  
According to Beth Shammai he must exchange the entire sela for copper.  This is consistent with Beth Shammai’s opinion in the previous mishnah: one cannot exchange silver second tithe with silver, but only with copper. 
According to Beth Hillel, he may exchange half of the sela for a silver shekel and the other half for copper.  Again, Beth Hillel holds that since he is exchanging part of the sela for copper he may also exchange part for silver.
Rabbi Akiva takes Beth Hillel’s position even further.  A person may exchange even ¼ of the sela (denar) for copper and the rest (3/4) for silver.  A sela is worth four denars. 
Rabbi Tarfon goes even further.  For the fourth denar he may even take four aspers of silver and one asper’s worth of copper.  An asper is 1/5 of a denar.
Shammai again is strictest.  He holds that he shouldn’t exchange the sela at all.  Rather he should leave it at a store and eat on credit.
