Eduyoth, Chapter Two, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Mishnah six contains three examples of one law, about which Rabbi Akiva disagreed with Rabbi Yishmael.

Mishnah Six
Rabbi Yishmael said three things, and Rabbi Akiba disagreed with him. 
Garlic or unripe grapes or green ears of grain were being crushed [on the eve of the Sabbath] while it is yet day:
Rabbi Yishmael says: “He may finish crushing after it grows dark.”   
But Rabbi Akiba says: “He may not finish.”

Explanation
According to Rabbi Yishmael, if a person began crushing garlic, unripe grapes or green ears of grain before the Sabbath, he may continue to do so on the Sabbath.  It would be forbidden to begin to crush these things on the Sabbath, since crushing and squeezing to get the juice out of produce is forbidden.  However, since he began crushing them before the Sabbath, and the liquid is already starting to come out, he may continue to do so.  The liquid from these things would be used for certain types of dips.
Rabbi Akiva forbids this.  According to him, just as it is forbidden to begin to crush, so too it is forbidden to continue crushing.
