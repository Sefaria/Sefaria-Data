Eduyoth, Chapter Four, Mishnah Four

Introduction
The Mishnah continues to bring disputes between Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel, in which Beth Shammai took the lenient position.

Mishnah Four
A sheaf which was close to a wall or to a stack or to the herd or to [field] utensils, and was forgotten, Beth Shammai says: it does not count as forgotten, 
And Beth Hillel says: it counts as forgotten.

Explanation
This mishnah continues to discuss the definition of “forgotten”.  According to Beth Shammai, if one left a sheaf close to a specific item, we can assume that he intended to go back and get the sheaf, and that is why he left it close to that item.  In this case he may go back and collect it at a later time.  Beth Hillel does consider this sheaf to be forgotten and therefore it belongs to the poor.  

Questions for Further Thought:
From whose perspective is Beth Shammai lenient in these mishnayoth?  Why does the editor of the Mishnah consider them lenient and Beth Hillel strict?
