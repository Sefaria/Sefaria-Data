Shabbat, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah One

Introduction
After having learned the laws of carrying from one domain to another, this chapter teaches laws concerning throwing something from one domain to another.

Mishnah One 
If one throws from the private domain into the public domain [or] from the public domain into the private domain, he is liable. 
From one private domain to another private domain, and the public domain lies between:
Rabbi Akiva makes him liable, 
But the sages exempt him.

Explanation
Section one:  Throwing is considered to be like carrying and hence one who throws from one domain to another is liable.
Section two:  Rabbi Akiva treats the object which flies over the public domain as if it had actually landed in the public domain. Therefore, in his opinion this person has taken something from the private domain and brought it out to the public domain.  The sages, however, rule that he is exempt because the object never actually landed in public domain.
