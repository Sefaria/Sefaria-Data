Shabbat, Chapter Thirteen, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah deals with minimum measures in processing wool and flax.

Mishnah Four
The minimum measure for bleaching, hackling, dyeing or spinning is a full double sit.  
And he who weaves two threads together, the minimum meausure is a full sit.

Explanation
Section one:  These are all forbidden labors mentioned above in 7:2.  The minimum measure for which one incurs liability is double a “sit” the length between one’s thumb and finger, as far as they can be spread.
Section two:  If one weaves two threads together on a loom, the minimum measure for liability is half of that above, meaning one “sit”.
