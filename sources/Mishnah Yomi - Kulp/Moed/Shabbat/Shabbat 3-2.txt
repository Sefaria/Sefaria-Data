Shabbat, Chapter Three, Mishnah Two

Introduction
In yesterday’s mishnah we learned about leaving a cooked dish on a double stove during Shabbat. Today’s mishnah discusses ovens and single stoves.  To understand these mishnayot we need to understand a little bit about how these things were made.  Double stoves are as wide on top as they are below and therefore they do not preserve heat particularly well.  Ovens are wider below than they are up top and are the best at preserving heat. Single stoves have only one opening up top—they are hotter than double stoves but cooler than ovens.

Mishnah Two
If an oven was heated with stubble or straw, one may not place [a dish] either inside or on top.   
If a single stove was heated with stubble or straws, it is like a double stove;     
With peat or wood, it is like an oven.

Explanation
Section one:  Since the heat of an oven is greater than that of a stove, it is forbidden to leave anything in or on top of an oven. Even if there is only a little fire, we are concerned lest she come to rake the coals on Shabbat.  The mishnah states that this is prohibited when the oven is lit with stubble or straw; all the more so it is prohibited if the oven is lit with peat or wood.
Section two:  If a single stove is heated with stubble or straw then we can treat it like the double stove and leave a dish on it on Shabbat.  However, if it was heated with peat or wood then it is like an oven and it is forbidden to leave dishes both on top and inside.  The Talmud adds that even if the coals had been removed or covered with ash it is still prohibited.
