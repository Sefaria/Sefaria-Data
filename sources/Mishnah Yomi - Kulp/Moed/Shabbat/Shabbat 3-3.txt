Shabbat, Chapter Three, Mishnah Three

Introduction 
This mishnah discusses cooking eggs in ways that might not be considered to really be cooking.   

Mishnah Three
They may not place an egg at the side of a boiler for it to be lightly roasted and one must not break it into a [hot] cloth.
And Rabbi Yose permits it. 
And one may not put it away in hot sand or road dust for it to be roasted.

Explanation
Section one:  Placing an egg next to a hot boiler will not suffice to really cook the egg, but it can lightly roast it, perhaps like a soft-boiled egg.  Similarly, putting the egg into a hot cloth can make it lightly cooked.  The first opinion in the mishnah holds that these actions are considered cooking and are therefore prohibited.  Rabbi Yose holds that this is not cooking and is hence permitted.
Section two:  Burying the egg in hot sand or dust will really cook it and hence even Rabbi Yose agrees that it is prohibited.
