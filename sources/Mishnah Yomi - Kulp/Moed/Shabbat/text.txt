Shabbat, Chapter Twenty-Four, Mishnah Five
 
Introduction

Mishnah Five
They may annul vows on Shabbat, and they may be asked [to release vows] when these are necessary for Shabbat. 
One may close up a skylight, and measure a rag and a ritual bath.   
And it once happened in the days of Rabbi Zadokâ€™s father and the days of Abba Shaul ben Botnit that they closed up the window with a pitcher and tied an [earthenware] pot to ascertain whether there was the opening of a handbreadth or not in the barrel.   
And from their words we learn that we may close [a skylight] and measure and tie on the sabbath.
