Shabbat, Chapter Four, Mishnah One

Introduction 
This brief chapter deals with covering up hot food with something that will preserve its heat.  The general rule is that the rabbis allowed storage in something that would preserve the heat but not in something that would increase the heat. The reason is that if this were allowed she might store the food in hot coals and then rake the coals to make them hotter.  Raking coals is prohibited.  When storage is prohibited it is prohibited even if she stores the dish before Shabbat begins.

Mishnah One
In what things may they cover up [food], and in what things may they not cover it up?   
They may not cover up [food] in peat, compost, salt, lime, or sand, whether moist or dry; 
Nor in straw, grape-skins, rags or grasses, when they are moist; but they may cover up [food] in them when they are dry.
They may cover up [food] in garments, produce, doves’ wings, carpenters’ sawdust and thoroughly beaten flax. 
Rabbi Judah forbids [storing] in fine [flax], but permits [it] in coarse [flax].

Explanation
Section one:  The material in this section adds heat to the dish whether it is moist or dried out. 
Section two: The material in this section adds heat if it is still moist but not when it is dry.  Hence it is permitted to cover up food with these things when they are dry.
Section three:  The material in this section does not add heat and only preserves it.  Hence it is permitted to cover up food with these things.  Rabbi Judah holds that fine beaten flax adds heat and it is therefore forbidden to cover up food with it.
