Shabbat, Chapter Seventeen, Mishnah Eight

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with carrying lids on Shabbat.  

Mishnah Eight
All lids of utensils which have a handle may be carried on Shabbat. 
Rabbi Yose said: in reference to what is that said?  In the case of lids which cover the ground, but lids of vessels may in any case be carried on Shabbat.

Explanation
Section one:  Since the lids have handles, they may be carried on Shabbat independent of the vessels which they cover.  Indeed, they themselves are considered vessels/utensils, since they have handles.
Section two:  Rabbi Yose limits the application of the rule stated above.  That rule applies only to lids used to cover holes in the ground. These may only be carried on Shabbat if they have handles.  If they don’t have handles, it looks like one is using them to permanently cover a hole in the ground, in which case this would be too similar to “building.”  If they have handles, then it is clear that they will not be used to permanently cover the hole.  
However, lids of vessels (i.e. pots and pans) may be carried whether or not they have handles.  It is clear that such lids are only temporary and that they are part of the vessel which they cover.
