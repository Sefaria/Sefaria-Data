Shabbat, Chapter Seventeen, Mishnah Five

Introduction 
This mishnah is concerned with carrying the fragments of vessels on Shabbat. 

Mishnah Eight
All vessels which may be carried on Shabbat, their broken pieces may be carried with them, as long as they can perform something in the nature of work. 
[Thus]: the fragments of a kneading trough [can be used] to cover the mouth of a barrel, [and] the fragments of glass [can be used] to cover the mouth of a flask. 
Rabbi Judah says: as long as they can perform something in the nature of their own work;   
[Thus:] the fragments of a kneading trough, to pour into them a thick mixture; and [the fragments] of a glass, to pour into them oil.

Explanation
Section one:  Broken pieces of vessels may still be carried on Shabbat as long as the broken pieces can be used for some purpose.  The mishnah illustrates what this means.  According to the first opinion, the shard need no longer fill any function related to the purpose of the vessel from which it came.  Rather it needs only to have some minimal amount of use.
Section two:  Rabbi Judah says that the vessel must still have a use related to the function of the vessel of which it was originally a part.  Thus a piece of a kneading trough must still be large enough to hold a thick mixture, a usage similar to its original usage.  
The Talmud explains that Rabbi Judah is referring to a case where the vessel broke on Shabbat itself.  In such a case, since when Shabbat began the vessel was intended for a specific purpose (such as kneading) no part of it can be used for something else on Shabbat.  By breaking on Shabbat and being used for something else it would be like a new vessel, one that was in essence made on Shabbat.  However, if the vessel was broken before Shabbat its pieces can be carried for other purposes on Shabbat, because when Shabbat began they were already capable of fulfilling other purposes.
