Shabbat, Chapter Thirteen, Mishnah One

Introduction 
This chapter deals with the work involved in making clothes.  Todayâ€™s mishnah deals with the prohibited labor of weaving.  

Mishnah One
Rabbi Eliezer says: he who weaves three threads at the beginning or one [thread] added to woven stuff is liable; 
But the sages say: whether at the beginning or at the end, the standard [for liability] is two threads.

Explanation
According to Rabbi Eliezer, there are two different standards for how much weaving causes one to be liable, depending on when the weaving is performed.  When beginning to weave cloth, one is liable only if she weaves three threads.  This is because without three threads the cloth has not really been begun.  However, if she weaves part of something that has already been started, she is liable even for one thread.  Even one thread contributes to an already-started cloth.    
The sages, whose opinion was already stated in 7:2, provide one standard measure, no matter when the weaving was done.  Liability is always for two threads, no matter at the beginning or in the middle.
