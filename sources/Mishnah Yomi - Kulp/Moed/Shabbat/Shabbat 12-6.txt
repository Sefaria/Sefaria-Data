Shabbat, Chapter Twelve, Mishnah Six

Introduction
The final mishnah in this chapter finishes our discussion of writing on Shabbat.

Mishnah Six 
He who writes two letters in two states of unawareness, one in the morning and one in the evening: 
Rabban Gamaliel declares him liable;
But the sages exempt him.

Explanation
The case is one where someone wrote two letters adjacent to one another, but she wrote them at different times, having remembered in-between that it was forbidden to write on Shabbat.  For example, she wrote the first letter in the morning, then remembered that it was forbidden to write on Shabbat and then she wrote another letter towards evening, again having forgotten that writing is forbidden on Shabbat.  Rabban Gamaliel says that she is liable.  He holds that finding out that something is forbidden in the midst of performing one forbidden labor (writing two letters) does not count as “finding out” in order to separate these into two distinct acts.  [In contrast, if she wrote two letters in the morning and then remembered that it was Shabbat, and then wrote two letters later in the day, she would be liable for two sin offerings.  The knowledge in-between separates it into two different acts. If she did not remember in the middle she would be liable for only one sin offering.]  
The rabbis hold that since these were two different states of unawareness, they do not join together and she is exempt.
