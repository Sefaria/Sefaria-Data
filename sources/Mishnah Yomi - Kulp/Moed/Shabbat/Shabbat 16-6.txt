Shabbat, Chapter Sixteen, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a non-Jew or minor, both of whom are not obligated to observe the commandments, who want to extinguish the fire.

Mishnah Six
If a non-Jew comes to extinguish, they do not say to him, “extinguish it” or “do not extinguish,” because his resting is not their obligation.   
But if a minor comes to extinguish, they must not listen to him, because his resting is their obligation.

Explanation
Section one:  One may not ask a non-Jew to perform a forbidden labor on behalf of a Jew on Shabbat.  Even though people often think that this is permitted, talmudic literature and subsequent halakhic authorities clearly prohibit it.  However, if the non-Jew comes on his own accord to extinguish the fire, Jews are not obligated to stop her from doing so.  A Jew is not obligated to make a non-Jew rest on Shabbat.  Therefore, if the non-Jew wishes to, she may put out the fire.
Section two:  If a minor comes to extinguish the fire the Jew must stop the minor from doing so, because the Jew has an obligation to make sure that the minor ceases performing forbidden labors on Shabbat.  The fact that the minor doesn’t really know that what she is doing is forbidden does not mean that she is allowed to do forbidden work on Shabbat, or that we may allow her to do such work.  
We should note that according to the Talmud Jews do not have to stop minors from doing forbidden things such as eating non-kosher food, or performing forbidden labors on Shabbat.  The mishnah refers to a case where the minor knows that the father wants to put the fire out and hence is doing so on her father’s behalf.  In such a case, other Jews are required to stop the minor from doing so.
