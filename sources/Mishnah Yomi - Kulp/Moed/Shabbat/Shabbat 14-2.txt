Shabbat, Chapter Fourteen, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah deals with preparing pickling brine on Shabbat.  According to commentators, this is similar to processing hides because both change the nature of something by soaking it in a mixture. 

Mishnah Two
They do not prepare [pickling] brine on Shabbat, but he may prepare salt water and dip his bread into it or put it into a cooked dish. 
Rabbi Yose said: but that is brine, whether [one prepares] much or little?  
Rather what is the salt water that is permitted? Oil is first put into the water or into the salt.

Explanation
Section one:  Pickling brine is “hilmi” in Hebrew.   “Hilmi” was a mixture of water, salt and a little bit of oil.  It was used to pickle vegetables.  Making “hilmi” is prohibited but making “salt water” is allowed (note that she is not merely “exempt”—rather this is allowed.)  
Albeck explains (based on the Palestinian Talmud) that making “hilmi” is the work of a professional and was therefore prohibited.  “Salt water” is made by non-professionals and hence is prohibited.  The Babylonian Talmud explains that “hilmi” was a large mixture, whereas as “salt water” is the same mixture but a smaller amount. 
Section two:  Rabbi Yose says that even “salt water” can be considered “hilmi” and therefore it too should be forbidden.  According to the Babylonian Talmud’s explanation, Rabbi Yose says that if we allow the making of salt water which is a small amount of “hilmi” people will think that small amounts of work are permitted but larger amounts are prohibited.  Therefore, if she wishes to make salt water, she should first put the oil either into the water or into the salt, and only afterwards put in the water.  In this way she weakens the salt, making it dissimilar enough to “hilmi” that it is permitted.  No one will think that she is making a solution that will pickle the vegetables.
