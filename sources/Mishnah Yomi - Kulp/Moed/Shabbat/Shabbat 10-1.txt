Shabbat, Chapter Ten, Mishnah One

Introduction
This mishnah connects back to what we learned above in 7:3.  If a person cares enough to store a certain something away, that means that that thing is important to her.  Therefore, if she carries it from domain to domain on Shabbat, she is liable no matter what its size is.  However, others who do not store such a thing, are only liable if they carry the minimum measure mentioned above.

Mishnah One
If one stores something for planting, for a sample, or for medicine, and [then] carries it out on Shabbat, he is liable no matter the size.   
But all others are not liable except for its standard measure.   
If he carries it back again, he is liable only for its standard measure.  

Explanation
Section one:  If a person stores a single seed in order to plant it, to show it to someone else or to use it for medicinal purposes, that person is liable for carrying it, even if it is of a minimal measure.  However, if another person carries that same seed, she is liable only if she carries a measure equal to that mentioned in yesterday’s mishnah.
Section two:  If after carrying this minimum measure of seed, the person who stored it carries it again, she is only liable if she carries a minimum measure.  The fact that she previously stored it away was only relevant for the first time she carried it.  If she carries it again and doesn’t again store it away, she is treated like all other people, and is liable only if she carries a minimum measure.
