Shabbat, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
How do we know that anointing is the same as drinking on Yom Kippur?  
Though there is no proof of this, yet there is a suggestion of it, for it is said, “And it came into his inward parts like water, and like oil into his bones” (Psalms 109:18).

Explanation
Two of the prohibitions on Yom Kippur are anointing (rubbing oil on oneself) and drinking.  Our mishnah teaches that both are similarly prohibited (although their punishments are different).  Their similarity is derived from the verse in Psalms which compares water with anointing with oil.  
We should note that according to most commentators the phrase, “though there is no proof of this, yet there is a suggestion of it” refers to all of the “proofs” in the above three mishnayot as well.  None of them are true “proofs” but rather “suggestions.”
