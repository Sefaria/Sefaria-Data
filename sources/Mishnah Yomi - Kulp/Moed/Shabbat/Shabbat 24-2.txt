Shabbat, Chapter Twenty-Four, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah teaches how one feeds one’s animals on Shabbat.

Mishnah Two
One may untie bundles of hay in front of cattle and one may spread out large sheaves, but not small hardened twigs.  
One may not chop up unripe grain or carobs before cattle, whether small or large.   
Rabbi Judah permits it in the case of carobs for small beasts.

Explanation 
Section one:   There are several different explanations for this section, but I will explain according to Albeck’s explanation, which differs from that given in other commentaries.
The general principle which we learn in this mishnah is that a person is allowed to do something which turns food which cannot be eaten by the animal into food which can be eaten.  Bundles of hay must be untied before they can be eaten, and large sheaves must be spread out before they may be eaten by the animal.  However, the small hardened twigs cannot be eaten by the animal even after they are spread out.  Hence, one may not untie or spread out a bundle of this type of twigs.
Section two:  Chopping up unripe grain and carobs is a lot of work and animals will eat unripe grain and carobs.  Since this work is not necessary and it is not easily performed it is forbidden on Shabbat.  Rabbi Judah holds that it is permitted to chop up carobs for small animals (sheep and goats) since they cannot eat the carobs until they are chopped up.  It is only forbidden for large animals which can eat unripe grain and carobs without them being chopped up.
