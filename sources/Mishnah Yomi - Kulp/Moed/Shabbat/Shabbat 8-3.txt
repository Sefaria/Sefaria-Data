Shabbat, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Three

Introduction
The mishnah continues to list the minimum amount of various items which must be carried in order for one to be liable. Again, the rule of thumb is the smallest amount that has practical use will make one liable.

Mishnah Three
[One who carries] animal hide:  as much as is required for making an amulet; 
Parchment, for writing on it the shortest passage of the tefillin, which is “Sh’ma Yisrael”: 
Ink, for writing two letters; 
Eye shadow, for painting one eye.

Explanation
Section one:  Animal hide was used to make small amulets.  Therefore, one who carries enough to make such an amulet is liable.
Section two:  Parchment is used for writing tefillin.  The smallest passage that goes on one piece of parchment in the tefillin is the Sh’ma.
Section three:  As we saw in yesterday’s mishnah, the shortest document, that of the tax collector, had two letters. Therefore, one who carries enough ink to write such a document is liable.
Section four:  Usually women would paint both eyes, but sometimes women would paint only one.  Therefore, one who carries enough eye-shadow to paint one eye is liable.
