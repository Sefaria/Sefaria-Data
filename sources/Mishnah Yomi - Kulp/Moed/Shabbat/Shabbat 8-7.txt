Shabbat, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
The final mishnah of our chapter is about the minimum size of a shard for which a person is liable for carrying. 

Mishnah Seven 
A shard, as much as is needed for placing between one board and another, the words of Rabbi Judah. 
Rabbi Meir says: enough to scoop out the coals with it. 
Rabbi Yose says: large enough to contain a revi’it. 
Rabbi Meir said: even though there is no proof of the matter, there is a hint: “So that no shard is left in its breakage to scoop coals from a brazier” (Isaiah 30:14).     
Rabbi Yose said to him: proof [of my view] is from there [as well]: “Or to take ladle water from a puddle” (ibid).  

Explanation
Section one:  A small shard would be placed between building pillars used in making a house, if there were gaps between the pillars or boards.  According to Rabbi Judah this is the measure of the type of shard one is liable for carrying on Shabbat.  This is the smallest of the measures given in the mishnah.  
Section two:  Rabbi Meir sets a slightly larger amount.  The shard must be enough to scoop out coals from a fire.  This is the largest measure of the three that are in the mishnah.  
Section three:   Rabbi Yose holds that the shard must only be large enough to hold a revi’it of water, which is about 3 oz.  
Section four:  In this section Rabbi Meir tries to prove from a verse in Isaiah that shards were used for scooping out coals.  Rabbi Yose responds that if that verse is going to be used, why not look to the end of the verse which proves that shards were also used to ladle water.  Therefore, a shard that is large enough to use to draw water is already large enough such that one who carries it is liable for carrying on Shabbat.
