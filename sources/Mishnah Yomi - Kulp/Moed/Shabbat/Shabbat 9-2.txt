Shabbat, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Two

Introduction
There are two more midrashim in this mishnah which are both based on passages that are not from the Torah. 

Mishnah Two
How do we know that a ship is clean?   Because it is said, “The way of a ship is in the midst of the sea” (Proverbs 30:19).  
How do we know that if a furrow is six handbreadths by six handbreadths, they may sow in it five kinds of seeds, four on the four sides, and one in the middle?  Because it is said, “For as the earth brings forth her growth, and as the garden causes its seeds to spring forth” (Isaiah 61:11) not its seed, but its seeds is stated. 

Explanation
Section one:  A ship cannot contract ritual impurity (uncleanness).  This is derived from Proverbs 30:19:  just as the sea cannot become impure, so too a ship cannot become impure.  
Section two:  This section has to do with the laws of forbidden mixtures of seeds.  The mishnah teaches a way that five different species can be planted in a six by six handbreadth furrow.   This would look like the table below (this is my first graphic, so here goes):

Since no seeds are actually next to each other, this is not considered “kilayim” —a forbidden mixture of seeds.  Eventually when we learn tractate Kilayim we will learn more about this halakhah.  
The mishnah derives this halakhah from the plural use of the word “seeds” in Isaiah. The verse implies that one garden can make five different kinds of seeds come up at the same time.  We should note, however, that the verse does not teach that five is possible and that six is not.
