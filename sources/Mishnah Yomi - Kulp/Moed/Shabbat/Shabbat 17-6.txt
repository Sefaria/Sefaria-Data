Shabbat, Chapter Seventeen, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah deals with certain unusual contraptions used to draw water from a well.

Mishnah Six
A stone in a dried-out pumpkin:  
If one can draw [water] in it and it [the stone] does not fall out, one may draw [water] in it; 
if not, one may not draw water in it.  
A vine-branch tied to a pitcher: one may draw [water] with it on Shabbat.

Explanation
Section one:  They would use the dried-out pumpkin to draw water from a cistern or well.  Because the pumpkin would float, they would place a stone in it to weigh the pumpkin down and submerge it in the water.  If the stone was attached well to the pumpkin, such that the stone would not fall out when submerged, one can use this contraption to draw water on Shabbat.  In such a case the stone is part of the vessel and it is not muktzeh.  However, if the stone is not attached well then one canâ€™t use it, just as one cannot pick up other non-useful stones on Shabbat.  Such stones are muktzeh because they have no practical use.
Section two:  The pitcher was attached to a vine in order to lower it down into the well.  The mishnah rules that one may use such a contraption on Shabbat and that the vine is not muktzeh.  Were the vine not to have a practical use, it would be muktzeh.
