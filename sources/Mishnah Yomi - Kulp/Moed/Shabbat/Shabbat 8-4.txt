Shabbat, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Four

Introduction 
This mishnah discusses minimum measurements for carrying various pastes and mixtures.  Some of these references are quite obscure and it is hard to tell exactly what the mishnah is referring to.  

Mishnah Four
Paste, for putting on the top of a lime twig.
Pitch and sulfur, for making a small hole.
Wax, for putting over a small hole.
Clay, for making a hole in a gold refiner’s pot.
Rabbi Judah says: for making a [tripod’s] leg.
Bran, for putting on the mouth of a gold refiner’s pot.
Lime, for smearing the smallest of girls.
Rabbi Judah says: enough to take off the hair on the temples.
Rabbi Nehemiah says: enough to take the hair of the forehead.

Explanation
Section one:  This paste was used to trap birds.  The birds would sit on a branch and if the branch was smeared with paste, the bird would get stuck.
Sections two and three:  To “make” a hole means to plug up a hole.  Pitch, sulfur and wax were all used for this purpose.  
Section four:  Clay was used to plug up a hole in a gold refiner’s pot.  Rabbi Judah disagrees and holds that the minimum amount is enough to fix the leg of a tripod, used to hold up small stoves.
Section five:  Bran was not regularly eaten by people (see 7:4).  Rather it was used to plug holes on the mouth of a gold refiner’s pot.  
Section six:  Lime was used to remove hair on women.  The Talmud explains that the amount referred to here is enough to remove the hair from a small girl’s finger.
Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Nehemiah provide slightly different measures for lime than does the first opinion.
