Shabbat, Chapter Twelve, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with the prohibition of writing on Shabbat.  

Mishnah Four
He who writes two letters in one state of unawareness is liable. 
He who writes with ink, arsenic, red chalk, gum, sulphate of copper or with anything that leaves a mark, 
on the angle of two walls,
or on the two leaves of a ledger, and they [the two letters] are read together, is liable. 
He who writes on his flesh, he is liable. 
He who scratches a mark on his flesh:
Rabbi Eliezer declares him liable to a sin-offering; 
But the sages exempt him.

Explanation
Section one:  If one wrote two letters and in-between writing the two she did not realize that she had transgressed, she is liable.  This rule shall be contrasted later in mishnah six.
Section two:  One is liable for writing with any type of ink that leaves a mark.  This list is the same as the list we saw in Gittin 2:3, where the mishnah listed inks which may be used in writing a divorce document.
Section three:  If one writes two letters on two different walls but writes them in the place where the two walls meet, she is liable.  Similarly, if she writes them on two pages of a ledger, if the two letters are read together, she is liable. We shall see the opposite case in tomorrow’s mishnah.    
Section four:  One is liable for writing one’s flesh.  According to the Rambam, the reason is that flesh is similar to parchment, which is made from animal flesh.
Section five:  One who scratches marks onto her skin is liable, according to Rabbi Eliezer.  The other sages say that she is exempt since this is not a normal way of writing.
