Shabbat, Chapter Five, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah is a continuation of yesterday’s mishnah.

Mishnah Two
A donkey may go out with its saddle-cloth if it is tied to it.     
Rams may go out with hides tied to them. 
Ewes may go out with their tails tied up, tied down, or covered. 
Goats may go out [with their udders] tied up. 
Rabbi Yose forbids in all these cases, save ewes that are covered. 
Rabbi Judah says: goats may go out [with their udders] tied in order to dry them up, but not to save their milk.   

Explanation
Section one:  If the saddle is put on the donkey before Shabbat, the donkey may go out on Shabbat with it on its back and it is not considered carrying but rather “wearing” which is permitted on Shabbat.  
Section two:  Some explain that these hides were put on the rams’ chests to protect them.  Others explain that they were put on their genitals, also for protection.
Section three:  If the ewe’s tail was tied up, that is so males can mount them.  If the tail was tied down it was so males could not mount them (there has to be some humor in this, but I won’t be the one to try).  The tail was covered for general protection.  
Section four:  The goats’ udders were sometimes covered up in order to dry them up and sometimes covered up in order to preserve their milk.  
Section five:  Rabbi Yose forbids all of the above cases except covering the ewes because all of the rest of them are for human benefit and not for the benefit of the animal.  If the covering was for human benefit then the animal may not go out with that covering on Shabbat.    
Section six:  Rabbi Judah is slightly more lenient than Rabbi Yose but less so than the first opinion.  He adds that goats’ udders may be tied up in order to dry them up because that is for the sake of the animal.  However, if the intent is to preserve their milk, that is for the sake of the goats’ owners and it is therefore considered carrying on Shabbat.
