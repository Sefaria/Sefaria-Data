Shabbat, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Four

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with throwing in bodies of water.  

Mishnah Five
If one throws in the sea four cubits, he is exempt. 
If there is a pool of water and a public road crosses it, and one throws [an object] four cubits in it, he is liable. 
And how deep is a pool of water? Less than ten handbreadths.
[For] if there is a pool of water and a public road crosses it, and one throws [an object] four cubits in it, he is liable.

Explanation
Section one:  The sea is considered a “karmelit”, a place which is neither a public nor a private domain.  That means that one is not liable for carrying or throwing in the sea. 
Section two:  This section deals with a pool of water that lies in the public domain.  If, the pool of water is less than ten handbreadths deep then one who throws an object four cubits into it is liable.  The reason is that if it is less than ten handbreadths, then it is considered to be part of the public domain and one who throws or carries in it is liable.  However, if the pool of water is more than ten handbreadths deep then it is no longer considered to be the public domain and one who throws in it she is exempt.
We should note that the Talmud questions why section two seems to repeat itself at the end.  From this repetition the talmud derives additional laws.
