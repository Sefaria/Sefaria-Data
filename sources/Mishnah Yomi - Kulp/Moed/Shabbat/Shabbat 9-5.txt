Shabbat, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
If one carries out wood, as much as is required for boiling a light egg; 
Spices, as much as is required for seasoning a light egg, and they combine with each other.   
Nutshells, pomegranate peel, woad and madder, as much as is required for dyeing a small piece of cloth the size of a hairnet. 
Urine, baking soda, lye, cimolian earth, and lion’s leaf, as much as is required for washing a small piece of cloth the size of a hairnet. 
Rabbi Judah says: as much as is required for removing the stain.  

Explanation
Section one:  For carrying wood, one is liable if she carries enough to fuel the boiling of a light egg.  
Section two:  For carrying spices, it must be enough to season an egg.  If she carries different types of spices, they all join together to equal one measure.
Section three:  These things were all used as dyes.  Woad was used to make blue dye and madder made red dye.  She is liable if she carries enough of these things to dye a small piece of cloth the size of a woman’s hairnet.  
Section four:  These materials were all used in laundering (sounds yucky doesn’t it?—aren’t you glad you use Tide!).  Therefore, she is liable if she carries enough to wash a small piece of cloth the size of a hairnet.  Rabbi Judah says that it must be enough to remove “the stain.”  This refers to a situation where a stain was found on a woman’s clothing and it is unclear whether or not the stain is menstrual blood.  They would wash it with the above five materials as well as two others (see Mishnah Nidah 9:6). If the stain didn’t come out, then they knew it was dye and not blood. The amount of each type for which one is liable on Shabbat is the amount that they used to put on the cloth to see if the stain would come out.
