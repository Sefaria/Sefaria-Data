Shabbat, Chapter Five, Mishnah Three

Introduction 
In the previous two mishnayoth we saw cases where t was permitted for an animal to carry certain things on Shabbat.  In today’s mishnah and tomorrow’s we see examples where it is forbidden.

Mishnah Three
And with what may it not go out? 
A camel may not go out with a pad 
Or with forelegs bound together or with hind legs bound together;    
And the same is true for other animals. 
One should not tie camels together and pull [one of them]. 
But one may take the cords in his hand and pull [them] providing he does not twist them together. 

Explanation
Section one:  The pad referred to her is put on top of its hump.  Sometimes it was tied underneath its tail so that it wouldn’t scratch the camel’s skin.  The reason that it is forbidden is that these often fall and we are concerned lest the pad falls off the camel and the owner carries the pad herself.
Section two:  One is not allowed to tie the animal’s legs together on Shabbat because this is considered overly cautious protection.  While it is permitted to offer reasonable protection so that the animal doesn’t run away, tying its legs together is beyond normal and hence this is considered “carrying.”  This prohibition applies not only to camels but to all animals.   
Section three:  Tying camels together and pulling them together makes it look like they are going to market.  To prevent this appearance it is forbidden to do so on Shabbat.  However, if she just takes the cords of several camels together in her hand and leads them together it is permitted because it doesn’t look like they are going to the market.
