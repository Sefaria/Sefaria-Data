Shabbat, Chapter Nine, Mishnah One

Introduction
In the last chapter of mishnah eight Rabbi Meir brought a proof for his halakhah from the book of Isaiah.  The proof was more of a “support” than an actual proof.  This phenomenon is called an “asmakhta” in rabbinic parlance.  The first four mishnayoth in our chapter all contain Biblical prooftexts of this nature.  

Mishnah One
Rabbi Akiva said: From where do we know that an idol defiles by being carried like a menstruant?   
Because it is said, “You shall cast them [the idols] away as a menstruous woman. Out! You will say to them” (Isaiah 30:22): just as a menstruant defiles by being carried, so does an idol defile by being carried. 

Explanation
Rabbi Akiva holds that a person who carries an idol is defiled by the idol, even if he doesn’t touch it and only carries it.  He derives this halakhah from a comparison that Isaiah makes between idols and a menstruant.  In his exhortation against idolatry Isaiah states that the people of Israel will cast out their idols like a menstruous woman.  Leviticus 15:22 teaches that a menstruous woman defiles things not just by touching them but even by sitting on them.  From here the rabbis derive that she transmits impurity also by being carried.  Rabbi Akiva learns from Isaiah that idols transmit impurity in the same way.
