Shabbat, Chapter Seventeen, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah discusses window-shutters.  These shutters were not always attached to the frame of the house as they are today.  Rather, they were sometimes attached and sometimes totally detached.

Mishnah Seven
A window-shutter: 
Rabbi Eliezer says: when it is connected and suspended, one may close [the window] with it; if not, one may not close [the window] with it.  
But the sages say: in both cases one may close [the window] with it.

Explanation
According to Rabbi Eliezer, it is permitted to close the window with the shutter only if the shutter is already connected to the frame of the house.  If it is not connected, then closing the window with it would be prohibited because it is similar to “building.”  In essence by closing the window it is as if he is adding another plank to the structure of the house.  However, if the shutter is attached and suspended from the house, then it is already part of the house and closing it is no different from closing the door of a house, which is of course permitted.
The sages say that it is permitted to close the window whether or not the shutter is attached to the house.  It is not considered “building” because the shutter is not permanently going to become part of the house.
