Shabbat, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah teaches that in order for a person to be liable for carrying she must carry in a way that is normal for carrying.  If she carries in an unusual manner, she is not liable.

Mishnah Three 
If one carries something out, whether with his right or with his left hand, in his lap or on his shoulder, he is liable, because this the way of the carrying of the children of Kohat (Numbers 7:9). 
In a backhanded manner, with his foot, in his mouth, with his elbow, in his ear, in his hair, in his belt with its opening downwards, between his belt and his shirt, in the hem of his shirt, in his shoes or sandals, he is not liable, because he has not carried [it] out as people [generally] carry out.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Numbers 7:9, the children of Kohat carried the Tabernacle with their shoulders.  Since we learn many of the principles of forbidden labor from the work in the Tabernacle, we can derive that carrying with oneâ€™s shoulders causes one to be liable for carrying on Shabbat. By extension, any normal form of carrying makes one liable.
Section two:  If the person carries something out in an unusual manner, she is not liable.  All of the ways mentioned in this section are unusual ways of carrying.  We should note that it is not permitted to carry in such a way.  When the mishnah says it is not liable it means that it is forbidden to do so, but if one does so, she is not liable.
