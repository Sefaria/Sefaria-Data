Shabbat, Chapter Seventeen, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our mishnah teaches that one may carry a vessel that is normally used to perform prohibited labor provided that the intent is to use it for something permitted on Shabbat.

Mishnah Two
A man may take a hammer to split nuts, an axe to cut a cake of pressed figs, a saw for sawing cheese, a rake to scoop up dried figs, a winnowing shovel and a pitchfork to place [food] upon it for a child, a reed or a shuttle to stick [food], a small needle to remove a thorn, and a sack [needle] to open a door.

Explanation
There are several types of utensils mentioned in this mishnah:  a hammer, an axe, a saw, a rake, a shovel or pitchfork, a reed or shuttle (both used in sewing), a needle and a sack needle.  All of these things are normally used to perform forbidden labors.  However, this mishnah teaches that a person may use them for permitted labors on Shabbat.  In all of these cases, the vessel listed is not the one normally used for such a labor.  Nevertheless, since the vessel can be used for said purpose, it is permitted.  For instance, if a person lost the key to a door, she may use a needle to try to pick a lock.
