Shabbat, Chapter One, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
The first section of this mishnah is a continuation of the previous mishnayot.  Here we learn that Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel’s house behaved like Bet Shamma and refrained from doing work on Friday if that work would continue onto Shabbat.  
The second section begins to list things that may be done on Friday, even according to Bet Shammai.

Mishnah Nine
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said:  My father’s house was accustomed to giving white clothing to a non-Jewish launderer three days before Shabbat.
And these and these agree that they lay down an olive press beams and wine press rollers.

Explanation
Section one:   The custom of Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel’s house was that of Bet Shammai.  In the Tosefta (a text from the same time period as the Mishnah) it is related that they would give colored laundry on Friday, because colored laundry is easier to clean than white laundry.  
Section two: Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel agree that one can begin the process of pressing olives and grapes on Friday, even though the work will continue on Shabbat.  Since as soon as she lays down the beams, most of the good juices will come out and the grapes and olives are crushed, the continuation of such a process is not considered to be work forbidden by the Torah on Shabbat. Therefore, Bet Shammai allows this.  Even on Shabbat, crushing already crushed grapes and already pressed olives is not considered to be work forbidden by the Torah, but rather only prohibited by rabbinic law—derabbanan.
