Shabbat, Chapter Thirteen, Mishnah Seven

Introduction 
The final mishnah of this chapter continues to deal with hunting (trapping).

Mishnah Seven
If one sat down in the doorway but did not fill it, and a second sat down and filled it, the second is liable. 
If the first sat down in the doorway and fills it, and a second came and sat down at his side, even if the first [then] rises and goes away, the first is liable and the second is exempt. 
To what is this similar? To one who shuts his house to guard it, and a deer is found to be guarded in it.  

Explanation
Section one:  If there is a deer in the house and a person sits down and with her body closes the opening of the house, she is liable for hunting.  If she doesnâ€™t fill the opening with her body, and a second person comes and fills the opening, the second person has closed the house and has thereby trapped the deer.  Therefore, the second person is liable and the first person is exempt.
Section two:  Once the first person sits in the doorway and thereby traps the deer, the first person is liable.  What the second person does is really irrelevant, because the first person has already trapped the animal.  Even if the first person gets up and leaves, and the second person is now keeping the animal in the house, the second person is not liable because she did not perform the labor herself.  The mishnah compares this to a case where a person closes her door to guard it from thieves and then finds that a deer is trapped inside.  There is nothing wrong in such a situation with keeping an already trapped deer inside the house.
