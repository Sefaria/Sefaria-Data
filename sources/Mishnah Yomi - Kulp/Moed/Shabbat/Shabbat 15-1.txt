Shabbat, Chapter Fifteen, Mishnah One

Introduction
This mishnah and the following one deal with the prohibited labors of tying and untying.  As we shall see in the mishnah, one is liable only if the knot is one that is intended to last.   

Mishnah One
These are the knots for which a person is liable?  
Camel-drivers’ knots and sailors’ knots. 
And just as one is guilty for tying them, so one is guilty for untying them. 
Rabbi Meir says: any knot which one can untie with one hand they are not liable for it.

Explanation
Camel-drivers would tie ropes to their camels’ noses and the ropes would remain permanently attached to the camels.  Similarly, sailors would permanently tie their ropes to their ships. Since these knots are intended to remain in their place for good, one who ties are unties such a knot is liable.
Rabbi Meir states a different criterion for determining whether a given knot entails liability. If one can untie the knot with one hand it is not a knot which entails a liability, even if it is intended to remain permanently in its place.  
It is interesting to note that according to the first opinion, what determines liability is intent—if it is intended that the knot remain forever then one is liable.  In contrast, the physical nature of the knot is, according to Rabbi Meir, what determines liability.  This is a debate we have often noted in the Mishnah—is the halakhah determined by the physical nature of an act or by the intention with which the act was performed.
