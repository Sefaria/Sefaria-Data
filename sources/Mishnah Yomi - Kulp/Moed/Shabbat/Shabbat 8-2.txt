Shabbat, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah teaches how much rope or paper a person must carry in order to be liable for carrying on Shabbat.  Again, in each case she is liable if she carries an amount that can be put to some use.  

Mishnah Two
One who carries out rope, as much as is required for making a handle for a basket; 
A reed cord: as much as is required for making a hanger for a sifter or a sieve. 
Rabbi Judah says: as much as is required for taking the measure of a child's shoe. 
Paper, in order to write a tax-collector’s receipt on it.     
And one who carries out a tax-collector’s receipt is liable.
Erased paper, as much as is required to wrap round a small vial of perfume.

Explanation
Section one:  A small amount of rope could be used to make a handle for a basket.  Therefore she is liable if she carries this small amount of rope.
Section two:  A reed cord might be used to make a hanger for a sieve or sifter; hence the minimum amount for which a person is liable is this amount.
Section three:  The smallest paper document would be a tax-collector’s receipt.  Therefore, if one carries paper which is this size she is liable.  Furthermore, if one carries out a tax-collector’s receipt written on something else such as parchment for which the minimum measure is normally larger (as we will learn in tomorrow’s mishnah), she is also liable.  According to the Talmud, the tax-collector would write only two letters on such a receipt.
Section four:  Erased paper is used paper which is no longer fit for use.  One of its uses was as a wrap around bottles, the smallest of which would have been a small vial of perfume.  Therefore, even if she carries such a small amount of erased paper, she is liable.  We should note that this amount is larger than the size mentioned in section three.
