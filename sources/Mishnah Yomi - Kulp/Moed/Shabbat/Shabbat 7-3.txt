Shabbat, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Three

Introduction
From here until the beginning of chapter eleven the mishnah discusses the labor of carrying.  Our mishnah introduces a general principle related to carrying.

Mishnah Three 
They also stated another general principle: whatever is fit to store and people generally store things like it, and one carries it out on Shabbat, he is liable for a sin-offering on its account. 
But whatever is not fit to store and people do not [generally] store things like it, and one carries it out on Shabbat, only he that stores it is liable.

Explanation
A person is only obligated for carrying something from one domain to another if the object which she carries is one that is important enough that people store it and guard it.  The object has to be one put to use by people. For instance keys are something that people are generally careful about, whereas a pebble is not.  It also has to be of the size that people are generally careful with and will store.  A loaf of bread would have such a size but a few small crumbs would not.  If one carries something from one domain to another that has this size and is of a nature that people store it to protect it, then the person is obligated to bring a sin-offering. 
 If it is not something about which people generally care, then only a person who does care about it is liable for it.  For instance if most people are not careful with a tiny piece of bread and a person who is not careful with such a piece of bread carries it from one domain to another, she is not liable.  However, if a person is careful with a small piece of bread and does take care of it, she would be liable for carrying it from one domain to another.
