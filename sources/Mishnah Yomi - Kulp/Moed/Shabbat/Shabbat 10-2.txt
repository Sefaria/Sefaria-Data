Shabbat, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our mishnah teaches two things:  1) a person is not liable unless she takes something from the public domain and puts it into the private domain or vice verse.  A domain that is neither public nor private does not count.  2) A person is not liable for performing one act of forbidden labor if the act is performed in two steps.  

Mishnah Two 
If one carries out food and places it on the threshold, whether he [himself] subsequently carries it out [into the street] or another does so, he is not liable, because the [whole] act was not performed at once. 
[If one carries out] a basket which is full of produce and places it on the outer threshold, though most of the produce is outside of the threshold, he is not liable unless he carries out the whole basket.

Explanation
Section one:  The threshold of a personâ€™s house is considered to be neither the public domain nor the private domain. While it is forbidden to bring something from inside the house and place it on the threshold, one who does so is not liable for carrying on Shabbat.  Our mishnah teaches that if the person divides carrying something from within the house to outside into two separate actions, first taking the object and putting it on the threshold and then picking it back up and carrying it out, she is not liable because she did not perform the entire forbidden act at once.
Section two:  This section builds upon the previous one.  The person has a basket of produce, which as we learned in 9:7 is treated as one item.  She places it on the threshold such that most of the produce that is within the basket is in the public domain.  Nevertheless, because the entire basket is not in the public domain, she is not liable.  Note that had she carried the food outside of the basket, she would have been liable.
