Shabbat, Chapter Twenty-Four, Mishnah Four

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with giving food on Shabbat to animals in cases where the food was not “prepared” for them on the eve of Shabbat.  “Prepared” here means that before Shabbat this food was not designated to eventually become animal food.  “Prepared” is the opposite of “muktzeh”.  

Mishnah Four
One may cut up gourds in front of beasts, and a carcass in front of dogs. 
Rabbi Judah says: if it was not carcass by the eve of Shabbat it is forbidden, because it was not prepared.

Explanation
Gourds are normally eaten by human beings and are too expensive to be given to animals. Nevertheless, the mishnah rules that if one has gourds one may cut them up and give them to one’s beasts.
The mishnah refers to a carcass of an animal that was alive when Shabbat began and became a carcass on Shabbat itself.   In such a case it was certainly not “prepared” before Shabbat to be given as dog food on Shabbat.  According to the first opinion, it is nevertheless permitted to give the carcass to the dogs.  Rabbi Judah disagrees and holds that the carcass is “muktzeh” and may therefore not be handled at all on Shabbat.
