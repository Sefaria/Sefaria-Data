Shabbat, Chapter Nineteen, Mishnah Six

Introduction 
This mishnah talks about some of the physical aspects of circumcision.

Mishnah Six
These are the shreds which invalidate circumcision: flesh that covers the greater part of the corona; and he may not eat terumah.   
And if he is chubby, he must repair it for appearance sake.
If one circumcises but does not uncover the circumcision, it is as though he has not circumcised.

Explanation
Section one:  If there are little pieces of skin left after the foreskin was circumcised, they must be removed if they cover the greater part of the corona.  If they are not removed the child is not considered circumcised and if he is a priest, he may not eat terumah, just as any non-circumcised priest may not eat terumah.
Section two:  If the circumcision was done correctly, but due to the child’s chubby appearance it looks as if he was not circumcised, the mohel should repair the circumcision so that it looks like he was circumcised.  Otherwise people will say that the child was not circumcised.
Section three:  As we learned in mishnah two, an essential part of the circumcision is the tearing of the membrane underneath the corona.  If this is not done, the circumcision is invalid.  Note, that other aspects of the circumcision are less essential, including the sucking.  The mishnah does not say that if the mohel did not suck the wound, the circumcision is invalid. This left room for some authorities to say that we don’t need to suck the wound, or at least that it need not be sucked through direct mouth to mouth contact.
