Shabbat, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Introduction 
This mishnah continues to discuss oils which may be used for lighting the Shabbat lights.

Mishnah Two
They may not kindle [the Shabbat light] with [terumah] oil [which must be] burnt on festivals.   
Rabbi Ishmael says: they may not light with tar, because of the honor of the Shabbat. 
But the sages permit with all oils: with sesame oil, nut oil, radish oil, fish oil, gourd oil, tar and naphtha. 
Rabbi Tarfon says: they don’t light with anything but olive oil.

Explanation
Section one:  This section deals with festivals.  Of all of the forbidden oils listed at the end of yesterday’s mishnah, this is the only one prohibited on festivals. The other oils are permitted. They are prohibited on Shabbat because they don’t light well and someone might come to tilt the lamp. Tilting the lamp is prohibited on Shabbat but not on festivals.  Hence, on festivals there is no reason to prohibit these types of oils.
Section two:  Rabbi Ishmael says that tar may not be used because it smells bad.  Furthermore, if the smell is really bad the person might extinguish it, which is prohibited on Shabbat.
Section three:  The sages allow the use of any type of oil, even tar and naphta.  It seems that the reason that most of the sages were so lenient is to keep the costs down, especially in places where good olive oil is not abundant.
Section four:  Olive oil is the best type of oil for lighting a lamp.  That is why it is customary to use olive oil on Hannukah (despite our modern custom of using wax candles). Rabbi Tarfon demands only the best for Shabbat.  In the Talmud the Sages respond by asking Rabbi Tarfon what people in lands outside of Israel who don’t have access to olive oil do.
