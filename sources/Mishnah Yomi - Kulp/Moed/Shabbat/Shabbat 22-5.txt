Shabbat, Chapter Twenty-Two, Mishnah Five

Introduction 
This mishnah discusses drying oneself off with a towel after bathing and the potential problem involved in wringing the towel.

Mishnah Five
One who bathes in the water of a pit or in the waters of Tiberias and dries himself even with ten towels, he must not bring them [back] in his hand.   
But ten men may dry their faces, hands, and feet on one towel and they may bring it [back] in their hands.

Explanation
Section one:  After the bather has dried herself, she may not bring the towel back to her home, lest in doing so she wrings it in order to squeeze out the water.  This is true even if she uses ten towels to dry herself and the last one has almost no water in it and doesn’t need to be wrung out.  It too may not be carried back to her home.  
Section two:  However, a towel which has been shared by a large group of people, and has therefore become very wet, may nevertheless be carried by the group.  Since there are many people together, they will remind each other that it is forbidden to wring a towel on Shabbat and they won’t come to transgress.
Note how the mishnah purposely exaggerates each section.  In the first section the tenth towel is barely wet, and nevertheless, it may not be carried.  In the second section the towel is soaked and nevertheless it may be carried.
