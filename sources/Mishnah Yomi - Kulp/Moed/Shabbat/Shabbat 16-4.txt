Shabbat, Chapter Sixteen, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah discusses saving clothing from the fire on Shabbat.

Mishnah Four
And to there he may carry out all his utensils;   
And he may wear all that he can wear and wrap himself in all that he can wrap himself.
Rabbi Yose says: [only] eighteen pieces of clothing.   
Then he may go back in and put on [more clothes] and carry them out.
And he may say to others, “Come and save with me.”

Explanation
Section one:  She may also save any utensils that he will need on that Shabbat. She may bring them out to the courtyard mentioned in yesterday’s mishnah.
Section two:  She may also put on as much clothing as she wishes in order to wear it out into the courtyard, and thereby prevent it from being destroyed by the fire.  Rabbi Yose does not allow this.  He limits the amount of clothing to eighteen articles, which according to the Talmud, is what people would normally wear during the week.  
Section three:  The mishnah allows her to keep going back into the house to wear more clothing.  This is another legal fiction meant to allow one to save more than just one set of clothing.
Section four:  The person whose clothing is threatened by the fire may invite other people to come wear her clothing, and thereby save them from the fire.  The “fiction” is that she is only inviting people to wear her clothing, wherein reality it is obvious that they are saving for her.  Indeed, unlike the case of food in the previous mishnah, here she actually says, “Come and save with me.”  Above she said, “For you.”
