Shabbat, Chapter One, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Today’s mishnah contains two more debates between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel over whether work may be begun on Friday before Shabbat, if that work will continue on its own throughout Shabbat.

Mishnah Six
Beth Shammai says: bundles of wet flax may not be placed in an oven unless they can begin to steam while it is still day, nor wool in the dyer’s kettle unless it can [absorb the color] such that [the color] is visible. 
But Bet Hillel permits it.
Bet Shammai says: traps for wild beasts, fowl, and fish may not be spread unless they can be caught while it is still day; 
But Bet Hillel permits it.

Explanation
Section one:  Bet Shammai prohibits putting flax in the oven or wool in the dyer’s kettle if the work will continue to be performed on Shabbat.  If the essential part of drying the flax or dying the wool has been done before Shabbat, then she may leave her things over Shabbat.  But if not, Bet Shammai prohibits.  Bet Hillel again permits this.  
Section two:  This is in essence the same debate as above.  The one innovation is that Bet Hillel permits even though the whole work might end up being done on the Shabbat, as opposed to the other cases where the work began on Friday.  Similarly, Bet Shammai forbids this, even though there is no certainty that the traps will catch anything on Shabbat.
