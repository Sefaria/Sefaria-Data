Shekalim, Chapter Five, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah deals with two other offices in the Temple. The difference between today’s mishnah and yesterday’s is that since the offices described have responsibility to deal with money they were filled by more than one person to prevent dishonesty.

Mishnah Two
They did not have less than three treasurers.
Or less than seven superintendents.
Nor create positions of authority over the public in matters of money [with] less than two [officers], except [in the case] of the son of Ahiyah who was over the sickness of the bowels and Elazar who was over the veil, for these had been accepted by the majority of the public.

Explanation
Section one:  The treasures were responsible for the Temple’s finances.  One of their important functions was to redeem sanctified property so that they could use the money for necessary projects.  (Sort of like selling Temple stock!)
Section two: The seven superintendents held the seven keys to the Temple courtyard.  They each needed to be there before the Temple courtyard could be opened.  When the doors were opened the treasurers could gain entrance.
Section three:  In all positions of monetary authority it was necessary to appoint at least two officers.  This seems to be a way of limiting the possibilities of dishonesty and fraud.  The only exceptions are the two single officers in the Temple, the son of Ahiyah and Elazar, who had monetary authority over the public (to buy spices and materials for the curtains).  This was acceptable because the public had trusted and allowed them to fill these positions as individuals.
