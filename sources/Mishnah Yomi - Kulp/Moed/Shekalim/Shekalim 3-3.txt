Shekalim, Chapter Three, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah continues to teach how the appropriation of the shekels was actually performed.

Mishnah Three
[The members] of Rabban Gamaliel’s household used to enter [the chamber] with their shekel between their fingers, and throw it in front of him who made the appropriation, while he who made the appropriation purposely pressed it into the basket.   
He who made the appropriation did not make it until he first said to them:  “Should I make the appropriation?” And they say to him three times:  “Make the appropriation! Make the appropriation! Make the appropriation!”

Explanation
Section one:  The mishnah reads “….of Rabban Gamaliel’s household.”  I have interpreted this as “the members” but it also may be interpreted to refer to an agent who brings the shekels from his household.  In any case, the purpose of the arrangement described here is to get the shekel immediately into the basket so that it can count toward the next appropriation.  The person bringing the shekel to the chamber would arrive on the day upon which the appropriation was made and would arrange so that the shekel was not just left in the chamber for a while but rather was put right into the basket.
Section two:  The ceremony described here was probably intended as a polemic against those groups of Second Temple Jews, perhaps Sadducees, who opposed the institution of the yearly shekel donation.  In order to make it loud and clear that the shekels are being appropriated and that the public sacrifices will be bought from this money, they made public declarations and affirmations that the appropriation was being done with the consent of the people.
