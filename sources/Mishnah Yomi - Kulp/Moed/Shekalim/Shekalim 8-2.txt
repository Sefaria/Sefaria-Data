Shekalim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Yesterday’s mishnah dealt with the purity of spit found in Jerusalem; today’s mishnah deals with the purity of vessels found in Jerusalem.

Mishnah Two
All vessels found in Jerusalem on the way going down to the place of immersion   are unclean, [but those found] on the way going up [from the place of immersion] are clean; for the way down is not the same as the way up, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
Rabbi Yose says: they are all clean, except the basket and the shovel or pick which are specially connected with [work in] cemeteries.

Explanation
Section one:  The place of immersion was a place below the Temple Mount where people could go to immerse themselves and their vessels (you can visit there today and still see many mikvaot).  According to Rabbi Meir, there was one path to go down and a different path to go up.  Furthermore, they would also carry the vessels down in a different way than they would carry them up. Hence, it was possible to distinguish between a vessel making its way down and one making its way up.  Obviously, one making its way down is assumed to be unclean and one making its way back up to the Temple Mount was assumed to be clean.
Section two:  Rabbi Yose says that in Jerusalem people are extra careful to make sure that they don’t leave unclean vessels lying in the streets. Therefore all vessels are unclean except for vessels which were most likely to have been used in cemeteries.  The basket referred to here was one in which bones were put into and moved to an ossuary.  The shovel was used to collect them and the pick was used to dig graves.  Since these almost certainly came into contact with a corpse or with bones, they have to be assumed to be unclean.
