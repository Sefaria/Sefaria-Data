Shekalim, Chapter Five, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah describes what happens if someone loses his seal, meaning he claims that he gave the money to Yohanan but by the time he got to Ahiyah to buy his libations the seal was lost.

Mishnah Five
If one lost his seal his case they wait [to deal] with him until the evening.   
If they found [money left over] to the value of his lost seal, they give [it] to him and if not he gets nothing. 
On the seals was inscribed the name of the day because of the defrauders.  

Explanation
Section one:  If he lost his seal, then they tell him to wait until evening when they reckon the accounts.
Section two:  If they find extra money equivalent to the amount his seal is worth, then they give him back the money or give him the flour, oil and wine for the libations he needs to bring.  But if there is no extra money then he gets nothing, since it is possible that he is lying.
Section three:  They would put dates on the seals to stop fraud, or at least make it more difficult.  The dates would prevent a person from claiming that he lost his seal and waiting until the end of the day in the hopes that Yohanan would have extra money.  In such a case the person could get his money back and then take out the seal and get the libations from Ahiyah.  By putting on dates this particular form of fraud became impossible.
