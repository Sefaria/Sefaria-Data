Shekalim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah contains the final three of the seven decrees mentioned by Rabbi Shimon in yesterday’s mishnah.

Mishnah Seven
[They further decreed] concerning the salt and the wood that the priests may benefit from them.   
And concerning the [red] heifer that using its ashes is not considered sacrilege.
And concerning bird-offerings which had become unfit [for sacrifice], that [others] should be offered [in their place] out of public funds. 
Rabbi Yose says:  the one who supplied the bird-offerings was bound to supply [those which had to be offered in the place of] those which had become unfit. 

Explanation
Section one:  The court decreed that salt and wood which had been donated to the Temple could be used by the priests to salt and cook the sacrificial meat.  However, they could not use this salt or wood to salt or cook non-sacrificial meat.
Section two:  The red heifer, used in the ritual to purify people from corpse-impurity, was paid for by the shekels collected in the chamber (see above 4:2).  Furthermore, the heifer is called a “sin-offering” in Numbers 19:9. Nevertheless, one who makes non-sacred use of this heifer’s ashes has not committed sacrilege (illicit use of sacred property).  The ashes are not considered to be like the sin-offering, only the live animal is, and therefore only one who makes illicit use of the live cow itself has committed sacrilege.
Section three:  The last decree of the court was that if bird offerings purchased with public funds (see above 6:5) should become unfit for sacrifice, their replacements should come from public funds as well.  
Rabbi Yose holds that the merchant who supplied the birds is obligated to supply replacements.  It’s not that it is the merchant’s fault that they became unfit.  Rather, the Temple had an agreement with him that if the birds become unfit, he would supply a replacement.
