Shekalim, Chapter Two, Mishnah Five

Introduction 
In the previous mishnayot we dealt with the subject of what surplus money is used for.  This mishnah discusses surpluses left over from money set aside for various other uses, mostly sacrifices or charity.

Mishnah Five
The surplus of [money set aside for] shekels is non-sacred property.
The surplus of [money set aside for the] tenth of the ephah, and the surplus of [money set aside for] bird-offerings of zavim, for bird-offerings of zavot, for bird-offerings of women after childbirth, and sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, their surplus [is used to purchase] freewill-offerings. 
This is the general rule: all [money set aside] for a sin-offering or for a guilt-offering, the surplus [is used to purchase] freewill-offerings. 
The surplus of [money set aside for] a burnt-offering [must be used] for a burnt-offering.
The surplus of [money set aside for] a meal-offering [must be used] for a meal-offering.

The surplus of [money set aside for] a pesach [must be used] for a wellbeing offering.
The surplus of [money set aside for] the offerings of nazirites [must be used] for the offerings of other nazirites.
The surplus of [money set aside for] the offerings of a [particular] nazirite [is used to purchase] freewill-offerings. 
The surplus of [money raised for] the poor [must be used] for other poor.
The surplus of [money raised for] a [particular] poor person [must be given] to that [poor person].
The surplus of [money raised for the ransom of] captives [must be used] for [the ransom of other] captives.
The surplus of [money raised for the ransom of] a [particular] captive [must be given] to that captive.
The surplus of [the money raised for the burial of] the dead [must be used] for [the burial of other] dead.
The surplus of [the money raised for the burial of] a [particular] dead person [must be given] to his heirs. 
Rabbi Meir says: the surplus of [money raised for the burial of] a [particular] dead person must be laid aside until Elijah comes.   
Rabbi Natan says: the surplus of [money raised for the burial of] a [particular] dead person [must be used] for building a monument for him over his grave. 

Explanation 
Section one:  This halakhah is according to Bet Hillel’s opinion in mishnah three.
Section two:  The tenth of the ephah (a measure of grain) is the sin-offering of a poor person.  The bird-offerings mentioned here are brought by men or women who have had abnormal genital discharge (zavim and zavot, see above 1:5) or by women after childbirth.  Money set aside for any of these offerings or for a sin-offering or a guilt-offering must be used to purchase freewill offerings. They can’t be used for other bird-offerings, sin-offerings or guilt-offerings because these can only be purchased for the sake of a specific sin or abnormal discharge.  However, the surplus is still sacred because these offerings don’t have a fixed amount (see above mishnah 2).
Sections three-five:  In all of these cases the extra money is used to buy another of the same type of sacrifice.
Section six:  The extra money which was set aside for a pesah cannot be used as a pesah, because the surplus is only created when the holiday is already over.  Rather the surplus is used to buy a wellbeing offering.  In Pesahim we saw that the pesah is a type of wellbeing offering (see Pesahim 9:6-7).
Section seven:  If charity collectors set aside money to buy nazirite offerings for nazirites who cannot afford to pay their offerings, then the surplus is used to buy other nazirite offerings.  However, if the money is set aside for a specific nazirite it cannot be used to buy an offering for a different nazirite. Rather the surplus is used to purchase freewill offerings.
Section eight:  Obviously, surplus charity should be used for more charity.  However, if there is money set aside for a particular poor person, and there is surplus from that money, it too must go to that poor person.  The charity collector may not say to himself, “That poor person doesn’t need all of that money.  I’ll give the rest to someone else.”  Rather, if the donor directed it to one person, the entire amount must be given to that person.
Section nine:  Surplus from money collected to redeem captives is used to redeem other captives.  However, if money was collected to redeem a specific captive, the surplus goes directly to that captive.
Section ten:  Surplus money collected to bury the dead is used to bury other dead people.  However, if the money was collected to bury a specific dead person there are three different opinions as to what to do with it.  According to the first opinion, the money goes to the dead person’s inheritors.  According to Rabbi Meir, it is forbidden to use it at all—it must go untouched until Elijah comes. Finally, Rabbi Natan says it is used to build a tombstone over his grave.
