Eruvin, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah introduces how much food must be set aside for both courtyard eruvin and alley partnership.  

Mishnah Eight
What is the quantity required?   
When the residents are many there should be food sufficient for two meals for all of them;  
And when they are few there should be food of the size of a dried fig for each one.

Explanation
Section one:  According to the Talmud, “many” means that there are more than 18 residents in the courtyard or alley.  In such a case they need leave enough food for two meals (this will be more fully explained in 8:2).  Even if there are a thousand residents, two meals is sufficient to count as an eruv for all of them.  
Section two:  If there are fewer residents, then there has to be food the size of a dried fig for each one.  If “fewer residents” means that there are less than 18 residents, it means that there the eruv  “18 dried figs”.  According to the Talmud, two meals must be more than 18 dried figs—meaning the size of the eruv for courtyards with many residents will always be greater than that for few residents.
