Eruvin, Chapter One, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah discusses the size of the cross-beam about which Bet Hillel and Bet Shammai debated in yesterday’s mishnah.  

Mishnah Three
The cross-beam of which they spoke must be wide enough to hold a small brick (ariah), a small brick which is half of a regular brick, the size of three handbreadths. 
It is enough for the cross-beam to be one handbreadth wide in order to hold the width of a small brick. 

Explanation
Section one:  The width of the cross-beam must be one and half handbreadths, in order to support an “ariah”, a half-brick, which would, at least potentially, be placed on top of it. 
Section two:  The length of the cross-beam need only be one handbreadth.  This way when the brick is placed on the cross-beam there will be a little space on each side (a finger on each side), where they can put the mortar to attach the brick to the beam.  Even if the cross-beam is not actually attached to the brick, at least it looks as if it will be. This lends it more of an air of permanence.
