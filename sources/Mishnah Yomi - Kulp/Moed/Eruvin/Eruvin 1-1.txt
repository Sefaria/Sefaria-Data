Eruvin, Chapter One, Mishnah One

Introduction
The first mishnah in Eruvin deals with the entrance to a closed alley.  As we mentioned in the introduction, Torah law allows one to carry within this alley.  However, the sages forbade this unless there is either a side-post or a cross-beam on top of the entrance.  The purpose of either the side-post or the cross-beam was so that people would recognize that the alley was not a public domain and they would realize that while it is permitted to carry in the alley, it is forbidden to carry in the public domain.  

Mishnah One
[The crossbeam] of an alley [whose entrance] is more than twenty cubits high should be lowered. 
Rabbi Judah says: this is unnecessary. 
And [any entrance] that is wider than ten cubits should be reduced [in width]. 
But if it has the shape of a doorway there is no need to reduce it even though it is wider than ten cubits.

Explanation
Section one:  The crossbeam cannot be more than twenty cubits high, otherwise people will not notice it.  This is the same rule as the sukkah—the sukkah’s roof (skhakh) cannot be more than twenty cubits high because people should notice that they are sitting in a sukkah.  In both cases, that of the crossbeam and the sukkah, Rabbi Judah rules that they may be more than twenty cubits high.
Section two:  An entrance to an alley may not be more than ten cubits wide for it to be allowed to carry within the alley.  If it is more than ten cubits, then it’s not truly an entranceway but a gap in the walls of the alley.  If it is more than ten cubits wide he can reduce it in order to carry in the alley.
Section three:  If the opening has the shape of a doorway, meaning there are poles on both sides and a beam on top of it, then it looks like an entrance and it may be wider than ten cubits.  According to the Rambam, if it has such an opening, the beam may even be more than twenty cubits high.
