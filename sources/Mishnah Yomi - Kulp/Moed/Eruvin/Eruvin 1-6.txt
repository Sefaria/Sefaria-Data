Eruvin, Chapter One, Mishnah Six

Introduction 
The mishnah now begins to talk about side-posts (see mishnayot one and two) and their minimum measurements.  

Mishnah Six
The side-posts of which they spoke [must be no less than] ten hand-breadths in height, but their width and thickness may be of any size whatsoever. 
Rabbi Yose says: their width [must be no less than] three handbreadths.

Explanation
The only size requirement for the side-posts is that they be at least ten handbreadths high (about a meter).  This is the minimum measurement for most things that need to be a certain height. For instance a sukkah must be ten handbreadths high.  
The mishnah uses the plural form of “side-posts” even though Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel require only one side-post, to teach that even those who follow Rabbi Eliezer, who does require two side-posts must still make them ten handbreadths high.  
According to the first opinion in the mishnah, there is no minimum measurement for their width and thickness.  
Rabbi Yose holds that they must be at least three handbreadths wide, a size worthy of actually serving as doorposts.
