Eruvin, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah discusses a heap of straw that divides two courtyards.

Mishnah Five
If a heap of straw between two courtyards yards was ten handbreadths high, they make two eruvin but not one.   
These may feed [their cattle] from this side and these may feed from the other side.   
If the height of the straw heap was reduced to less than ten handbreadths, one eruv may be prepared but not two. 

Explanation
Section one:  Although we learned above in mishnah three that straw that was used to fill a ditch is not significant and that the ditch remains a partition between the two courtyards, here we learn that a heap of straw itself can serve as such a partition.  This is because people sometimes do use heaps of straw in order to divide areas.
Section two:  Just as it was permitted to eat the produce on top of the wall, so too cattle-owners on each side can allow their cattle to graze from either side of the straw heap. 
Section three:  If the heap of straw became less than ten handbreadths high, it ceases to serve as a partition, and then both courtyards must share an eruv.
