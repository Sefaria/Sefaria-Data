Eruvin, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah contains two independent mishnayot. The first deals with a ledge in front of a window and the second deals with a person standing in one domain and moving objects in another.  

Mishnah Four
If there was a ledge in front of a window it is permitted to put objects on it or to remove objects from it on Shabbat.
A man may stand in a private domain and move objects in a public domain or he may stand in a public domain and move objects in a private domain, provided he does not take them beyond four cubits.

Explanation 
Section one:  The ledge in front of the window of a house is assumedly more than ten handbreadths above the public domain.  As we learned in yesterdayâ€™s mishnah, the air more than ten handbreadths above the public domain is not considered to be part of the public domain.  Therefore, it is permitted to move objects from the house onto the ledge and vice versa. Some commentaries add that the ledge must be four handbreadths wide and long so that it can be considered a private domain.
Section two:  The mishnah teaches that a man may stand in one domain and move objects within another domain and that we are not concerned lest he come to bring something from one domain into the other.  Had we had that concern we would not have allowed him to stand in one domain and even touch an object in another domain.  The only thing that he is not allowed to do is stand in the private domain and move an object four cubits in the public domain, since this is always prohibited.
