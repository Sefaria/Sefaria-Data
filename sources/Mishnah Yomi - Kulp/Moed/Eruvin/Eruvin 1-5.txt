Eruvin, Chapter One, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah is a continuation of Rabbi Judah’s words from yesterday’s mishnah.  Rabbi Judah held that the cross-beam need not actually be strong enough to support a half-brick.  

Mishnah Five
If [the cross-beam] was made of straw or reeds, we look at it as if it was of metal. 
[If it was] curved we look at it as if it were straight. 
[If it was] round we look at it as if it were square. 
Whatever has a circumference of three handbreadths has a diameter of one handbreadth. 

Explanation
Section one:  If the cross-beam was made of a material which could not hold a half-brick, Rabbi Judah considers it nevertheless as if it was strong enough to do so.  
Section two:  If it was curved, it also could not hold a half-brick.  Nevertheless, Rabbi Judah holds that it is valid.
Section three:  Again, a round cross-beam could not hold a half-brick.  However, it still must be wide enough to hold a one handbreadth half-brick.  In order for this to be true, it must have a circumference of three handbreadths (the rabbis knew that pi was roughly three to one, and they knew that this was not exact).
