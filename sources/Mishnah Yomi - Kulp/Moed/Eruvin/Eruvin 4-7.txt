Eruvin, Chapter Four, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah discusses a person who doesn’t make it back to his town before Shabbat begins, but arrives at a place where he recognizes a tree or a fence within 2000 cubits from his town.

Mishnah Seven
One who was on a journey and it became dark, and he recognized a tree or a fence and said, “Let my Shabbat place be under it”, he has said nothing.  
If he said, “Let my Shabbat place be at its root”,  he may walk from the place where he stands to its root a distance of two thousand cubits, and from its root to his house another two thousand cubits. Thus he can walk four thousand cubits after dusk.

Explanation
Section one:  A “Shabbat place” is the place from which we measure the 2000 cubits which a person may walk on Shabbat.  One who says “let my Shabbat place be under it [the tree or fence]” is not specific enough because he did not say which four cubits under the tree will be his “Shabbat place”.  In the Talmud, two amoraim (sages who lived after the Mishnah) debate what this means.  According to Rav, he cannot even walk to the tree and all he has is four cubits in each direction.  Since he did not acquire a Shabbat place under the tree, he has no Shabbat place at all.  According to Shmuel, he may walk to the tree or fence, but he may not walk from there to his house.
Section two:  If he says “at its root”, then he has been specific about where he wants his Shabbat place to be, and he may go from his current position to the tree and then from the tree to his home.  His Shabbat place is at the tree or fence and so he may walk 2000 cubits to get there and then another 2000 cubits in all directions from there.
