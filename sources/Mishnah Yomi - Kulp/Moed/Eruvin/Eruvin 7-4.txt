Eruvin, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with a ditch separating two courtyards.  

Mishnah Four
If he placed over it a board four handbreadths wide, and so also where two balconies   are opposite one another, the residents may prepare two eruvin or, if they prefer, only one. 
[If the board] was less wide two eruvs may be prepared, but not one.

Explanation 
If someone “bridges” the ditch with a board four handbreadths wide, the two courtyards can now be treated as one.  The board is to the ditch like the opening was to the wall—both serve as passages from one courtyard to the other.  
The second clause of the mishnah states the opposite—if the board was less than four handbreadths wide, then it does not serve as a passage because people would be hesitant about crossing.  In such a case each courtyard must set up its own eruv.  
The mention of the two balconies is abbreviated here and must be fleshed out.  The two balconies can join two courtyards if there is a four handbreadth wide board which bridges the two.  In such a case they may make either two separate eruvin or one for both.  If there is no such board, then they must make separate eruvin.
