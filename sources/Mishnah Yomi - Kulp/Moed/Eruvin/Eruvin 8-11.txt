Eruvin, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Eleven

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with pouring out water.  The situation is one in which two buildings are opposite from each other in a courtyard that is less than four cubits.  

Mishnah Eleven
So too in the case of two two-storied buildings this one opposite that one:  if some of the tenants made a trough and others did not, those who made the trough are permitted to pour down their water, but those who did not make any trough are forbidden.

Explanation
The basic message of this mishnah is that every row of buildings needs its own drainage trough, whether or not people are living in all of the buildings.  If there is only one trough, then only the side that made the trough can pour water out.
The difficulty with this mishnah is determining whether or not they set up an eruv.  If they set up an eruv together, then both sides should be permitted, and if they didn’t, then neither side should be.  The Talmud explains that the mishnah relates to a case where they did not set up an eruv.  Pouring out water into the drain is permitted even without an eruv, but the sages said that only the side that set up the eruv is allowed to do so lest the people from the other side take out their waste-water containers and carry them to the other side’s drainage ditches. Without an eruv carrying out these vessels would be prohibited.  However, if the two sides set up an eruv, it matters not how many drainage ditches there are and all may pour there water out into even one ditch.
