Eruvin, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah continues yesterday’s discussion of the enclosure around the well.  Yesterday we talked about the posts set up to enclose the space.  Today we talk about the proximity of the posts to the well itself.  
 
Mishnah Two
It is permitted to bring [the posts] close to the well, provided that a cow’s head and the greater part of its body can be within [the enclosure] when drinking.  
It is permitted to remove [the posts] to any [distance] provided one increases the posts.

Explanation 
Section one:  Some people might not want to make the enclosure to large since a large enclosure would overly interfere with the passing traffic in the public domain.  The mishnah allows them to bring the posts in close to the well as long as a single cow can fit its head and most of its body within the enclosure when drinking.  The Talmud explains that this is two cubits.  More than this amount and there may be a problem of carrying from the private domain to the public domain.
Section two:  They can move the posts as far away from the well as they wish, as long as they increase the number or size of posts so that there remains no gap greater than either 10 cubits (Rabbi Meir) or 13 1/3 cubits (Rabbi Judah), as explained in yesterday’s mishnah.
