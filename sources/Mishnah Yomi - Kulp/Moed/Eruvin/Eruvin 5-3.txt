Eruvin, Chapter Five, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah deals with three villages in the shape of a triangle.  If they are close enough to each other they can be treated as one village, and one eruv can be set for all three and the Shabbat border is drawn around all three.

Mishnah Three
So also three villages arranged in the shape of a triangle, if between the two outer ones there is a distance of a hundred and forty-one and a third cubits, the middle one causes all the three of them to be regarded as one.  

Explanation
In the previous mishnah we learned that if there were less than 70 and a fraction cubits between two towns, that they can be treated as one town and that the Shabbat border is drawn around the two of them together. Here we learn that if there are three towns in the shape of a triangle, the middle town can join the outer oneâ€™s together, as long as there is not an empty space of more than 140 and a third cubits (twice 70 and a fraction) between each outer town and the middle, joining town. In other words, they are all treated as if they are in a row, a situation which we dealt with in the previous mishnah.
