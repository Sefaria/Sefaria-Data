Eruvin, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah deals with moving body fluids, urine and spit, from one domain to the other.

Mishnah Five
A man may not stand in a private domain and urinate in a public domain or in a public domain and urinate in a private domain, and similarly he may not spit.   
Rabbi Judah says: even when a person’s spit accumulated in his mouth, he must not walk four cubits before he spat out.  

Explanation
Section one:  It is forbidden to stand on Shabbat in one domain and urinate or spit into another domain.  The Talmud adds that one who does so is liable to bring a sin offering, which means that this is considered a toraitic violation.  We might have thought that since the urine and spit come from his own body that he is not liable, therefore the mishnah comes to teach us that he is liable.
Section two:  Rabbi Judah adds that one is liable even for carrying accumulated spit in one’s mouth.  Note that this is only true once the spit has accumulated—otherwise he would be obligated to spit (or swallow) every four cubits.
