Eruvin, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with carrying underneath areas that are considered to be public domains.

Mishnah Four 
One who builds an upper room on the top of two houses, and so too in the case of viaducts, they may carry underneath them on Shabbat, the words of Rabbi Judah. 
But the sages prohibit this. 
Rabbi Judah moreover said: an eruv may be prepared for an alley that is a thoroughfare;   
But the sages forbid this.

Explanation
Section one:  There are two situations described in this section.  In the first a person builds an upper chamber on top of two houses, meaning it spans two houses which are on opposite sides of the public domain.  This means that people below are passing through a “covered public domain”.  Similarly, a viaduct is a bridge which passes over the public domain, such that the people who walk beneath it are passing through a covered public domain.  Rabbi Judah says that one can carry in a covered public domain, and therefore one can carry in these areas.  According to the Talmud, we fictionally draw the edges of the roofs down to the ground so that the public domain has four walls, making it in essence a private domain.  
The rabbis prohibit carrying in this type of area.  Although they do not consider the area to truly be a public domain, and one who carries there is not liable for a Toraitic transgression, it is nevertheless prohibited.
Section two:  Most of the alleys that we have been discussing up until now have been alleys with only one open end.  All agree that one can set up an eruv for this type of an alley. They disagree with regard to an alley which is open on two ends, one which people can use as a thoroughfare.  Rabbi Judah says that one may set up an eruv even for an alley with two open ends whereas the rabbis say that this type of alley is like a public domain and it is forbidden to set up an eruv there.
