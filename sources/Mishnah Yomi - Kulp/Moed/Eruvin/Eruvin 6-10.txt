Eruvin, Chapter Six, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with two courtyards, an inner one and an outer one.

Mishnah Ten
If one of the [residents] of the outer courtyard forgot to participate in the eruv, the inner courtyard is permitted but the outer one is forbidden. 
If one of the [residents] of the inner courtyard forgot to contribute to the eruv, both courtyards are forbidden.  
If they gave their eruv in the same place and one [resident], whether of the inner courtyard or of the outer courtyard, forgot to contribute to the eruv, both courtyards are forbidden.   
If the courtyards belonged to individuals, they need not prepare any eruv.

Explanation
Section one:  If one of the residents of the outer courtyard forgot to participate in their eruv, the eruv of that courtyard is ineffective, as we have learned several times in this chapter.  However, the inner courtyard’s eruv is still valid, since it doesn’t depend on that of the outer one.
Section two: In this case, since the inner courtyard’s eruv is invalid, the outer courtyard’s eruv is ineffective as well (as we learned in section two of yesterday’s mishnah).
Section three:  If both courtyards put their eruv together, they become like one domain with one eruv. Therefore, if even one resident from either courtyard forgot to participate in the eruv, it becomes forbidden to carry in either courtyard.  This is like the normal situation where one person forgot to participate in the eruv, thereby causing it to be forbidden to carry in the entire courtyard.
Section four:  If each courtyard belongs to an individual, then neither must set up an eruv in order to carry within his own courtyard.  This opinion matches that which was taught in section three of yesterday’s mishnah, that if each courtyard sets up its own eruv, the residents of each may carry in their own courtyard.
