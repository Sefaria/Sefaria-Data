Eruvin, Chapter Six, Mishnah Five

Introduction 
Our mishnah deals with people who share an alley or courtyard and who also have a business partnership in some type of food item. Under certain circumstances, they need not make an eruv because their partnership counts as if it was an eruv.

Mishnah Five
A householder who was in partnership with his neighbors:  with this one in wine and with the other in wine, they need not prepare an eruv.
But if his partnership was with the one in wine and with the other in oil, they must make an eruv.   
Rabbi Shimon says: neither in the one case nor in the other need they make an eruv.

Explanation
Section one:  Since the residents of the alley/courtyard jointly own wine, this wine counts as their eruv, even though the wine is for business and not for the shared meal of the eruv.   
Section two:  In this case, one of the residents has a partnership with one person in wine and with another in oil.  However, there is not one partnership in one food item that exists between all three people.  Since there is no partnership that bridges between all three of them, they must set up an eruv and their business partnerships do not count as an eruv.  
Rabbi Shimon says that if he has a partnership with one in wine and with the other in oil he need not set up an eruv, because sometimes eruvin are set up with two or more items, even with wine and oil.  Therefore, the partnership bridges the gap between the three of them.
