Eruvin, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
In today’s mishnah Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua disagree over whether one can set up an eruv with a broken loaf of bread.

Mishnah Ten
They may set up an eruv or a shittuf with all kinds [of food] except for water or salt, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. 
Rabbi Joshua says: a whole loaf of bread is a valid eruv. Even a baking of one se’ah, if it is a broken loaf, may not be used for eruv while a loaf of the size of an issar, provided it is whole, may be used for  eruv.

Explanation
The first line of this mishnah was already taught above in mishnah 3:1, but the context there was border eruvin (eruvei techumin), while here it is courtyard eruvin and alley partnerships (shittufim).  
Everyone agrees that all types of food except salt and water may be used to set up an eruv.  The disagreement in our mishnah is about whether a broken loaf of bread may be used.  According to Rabbi Eliezer even a broken loaf is valid.  Rabbi Joshua disagrees and holds that only a full loaf is valid.  Even if it contains a large amount of dough, even a full seah, if it is broken it is not valid.  However, if it is a complete loaf, even if it small, it can count towards one’s eruv.  According to the Rambam, a full loaf can constitute an eruv even if it doesn’t meet the minimum requirements listed above in mishnah eight. However, according to Rashi, the small loaf counts towards the eruv, but doesn’t count as the whole eruv unless the minimum requirements are met.
