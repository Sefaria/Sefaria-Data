Eruvin, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah is a continuation of yesterday’s mishnah which discussed how one sets up an alley partnership.

Mishnah Seven
If the food was reduced, he must add to it and confer possession [upon the other residents] but he need not inform them. 
If the number of residents has increased, he must add food and confer possession [upon them], and he must inform them.

Explanation
Section one:  In tomorrow’s mishnah we will learn that there is a minimum amount of food that is necessary for the eruv to be valid.  If the amount of food is reduced (before Shabbat begins) he (or another one of the residents) must add to it to make it reach the minimum measure.  He must confer ownership of this extra food upon the other residents of the alley, in the same way that he did when he set up the eruv to begin with.  However, since he already announced that he was setting up an alley partnership, and thereby let all of the residents know that he was including them, he need not inform them that he is adding to the food.
Section two:  As we will learn tomorrow, the size of the eruv is somewhat related to the number of residents in the alley.  If between when he set up the eruv and the beginning of Shabbat the number of residents increased (this is admittedly unlikely) he might have to increase the food in the eruv.  When doing this he must again confer possession upon them and in this case he must inform them of what he is doing, because some of the residents were not there when he made his original announcement.
