Eruvin, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Three

Introduction 
Today’s mishnah is about a ditch that separates two courtyards.  The rules concerning the ditch are very similar to the rules about the wall which we learned yesterday.

Mishnah Three
If a ditch between two courtyards was ten handbreadths deep and four handbreadths wide, they may make two eruvin but not one, even if it was full of stubble or straw.   
If it was full of earth or gravel, only one eruv may be prepared, but not two.

Explanation
Section one:  Just as a ten handbreadth high, four handbreadth wide wall is sufficiently large to separate the two courtyards, so too acts a ditch ten handbreadths deep and four handbreadths wide.  This is true even if the ditch is full of straw or stubble.  These do not count as filling up the ditch because people don’t generally leave them there for good.  Rather they may store the straw or stubble in the ditch for a while until they need them later on.  In other words, it’s still a ditch. Since these are two separate courtyards, each one must have its own eruv.  
Section two:  In contrast, usually when people fill a ditch with earth or gravel, it is because they no longer want the ditch.  They don’t usually “store” their dirt there, only to get it back later.   Once filled with earth or gravel, the ditch is no longer there.  Therefore, the two courtyards are actually only one and only one eruv may be prepared.
