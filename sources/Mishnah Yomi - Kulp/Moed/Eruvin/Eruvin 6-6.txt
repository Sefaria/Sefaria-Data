Eruvin, Chapter Six, Mishnah Six

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with a situation where five different companies of men are spending Shabbat in one hall within a courtyard. The question is whether each company must contribute separately to the courtyardâ€™s eruv set, or whether it is sufficient for all of the five companies to make one joint contribution to the eruv.

Mishnah Six
Five companies [of men] who spent Shabbat in one hall:: 
Bet Shammai says:  an eruv for each an every company;   
But Bet Hillel says: one eruv for them all.   
They agree that where some of them occupy rooms or upper chambers, that they must make an eruv for each and every company.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Bet Shammai, since each of the five groups is distinct from the other, they must each set up their own eruv.  Bet Hillel holds that since they are residing in the same hall, they can be treated as one entity and they may make one joint contribution to the eruv.
Section two:  If the hall leads to other rooms or to upper chambers and some members of the various groups are in these other areas, each company must make a separate contribution to the eruv.  Even though all of these areas are connected to the main hall, the hall is not sufficient to make it as if they were all in the same house.  The Yerushalmi explains that the hall is to the rooms as a courtyard is to houses:  just as every house connected to the courtyard must contribute to the eruv, so too every company in the hall must contribute.
