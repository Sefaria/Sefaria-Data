Eruvin, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
The first part of this mishnah is a continuation of yesterday’s mishnah.  The second part explains why the rabbis instituted courtyard eruvin in the first place.  

Mishnah Nine
Rabbi Yose says: When does this apply? To the beginnings of the eruv but in the case of the remnants of an eruv even the smallest quantity of food is sufficient,   
They said that one should set up an eruv for courtyards only so that the law should not be forgotten by the children.  

Explanation 
Section one:  According to Rabbi Yose, the minimum measurement for the eruv provided in yesterday’s mishnah applies only to when the eruv is set up before Shabbat.  When one sets up an eruv, it must contain a minimum amount of food.  If the eruv is lessened during Shabbat as long as there is a minimum amount that remains, it is still valid.  
Section two:  This section is usually interpreted as being independent of the previous section.  The mishnah addresses the problem of why both courtyard eruvin and alley partnerships are necessary—since the alley is larger, it alone should suffice to allow people to carry within its area.  The mishnah explains that since alleys are bigger, children will not notice the food set aside for the alley partnership and will think that it is permitted to carry without an eruv at all.  Therefore, the rabbis instituted courtyard eruvin so that children would remember that without an eruv one cannot carry things out of one’s house into the courtyard or alley, nor carry things within those two areas.  Some commentators explain that this is why the courtyard eruv can be valid even if there only remains a minute amount of food.
