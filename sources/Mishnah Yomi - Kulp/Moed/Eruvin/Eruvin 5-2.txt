Eruvin, Chapter Five, Mishnah Two

Introduction 
A karpaf is a field used for storing wood.  Its typical size is seventy cubits and a fraction long.  In our mishnah the sages debate whether the size of a town is automatically extended by a karpaf.  

Mishnah Two
They give a karpaf [as an extension] for every town, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
But the sages say: they said [the of a] karpaf only in regard to two towns that if there was to this one [a piece] of land of seventy cubits and a fraction and to the other one [a piece of land] seventy cubits and a fraction, they can consider the karpaf as combining the two into one.  

Explanation
Section one:  According to Rabbi Meir, when measuring the Shabbat limit they extend a karpafâ€™s length of a field to the size of the city.  From the end of this field they will measure the 2000 cubits square.  
Section two:  The other sages do not agree that every city is automatically extended by a karpaf.  They agree that there was a halakhah stated concerning a karpaf and its use in extending a city, but this halakhah is more limited in scope.  If there are two cities close enough to one another that if there was a karpaf of seventy and a fraction cubits attached to each one, they would overlap (they are not more than 140 and 2/3 cubits apart), then the two cities can be considered one.  The ramification would be that people could go from one to the other and that their Shabbat border would be drawn around the two cities.
