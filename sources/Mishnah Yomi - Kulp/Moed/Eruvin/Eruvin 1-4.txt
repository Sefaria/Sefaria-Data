Eruvin, Chapter One, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah is a direct continuation of yesterdayâ€™s mishnah, in which we learned that the cross-beam needs to be wide enough to support a half-brick.

Mishnah Four
Wide enough to hold a half-brick but also strong enough to support such a half-brick.  
Rabbi Judah says: wide enough, even though it is not strong enough.

Explanation
In this mishnah there is a debate whether or not the cross-beam must actually be strong enough to support the half-brick, or whether it is sufficient for it to merely look big enough.  According to the first opinion, the cross-beam must actually be strong enough, whereas Rabbi Judah holds that is must only be wide enough, but not actually strong enough.
