Pesahim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Two
 
Introduction
In yesterday’s mishnah we learned that one who was far away from the Temple when the first Pesah occurred gets a second chance and may observe Pesah Sheni.  Our mishnah defines what “far off” means.

Mishnah Two
What is “a far-off journey”? 
From Modi’im and beyond, and the same distance on all sides [of Jerusalem], the words of Rabbi Akiva. 
Rabbi Eliezer says: from the threshold of the Temple court and beyond. 
Rabbi Yose said to him: for that reason the heh has a dot on it in order to say, not because it is really far-off, but [even when one is] from the threshold of the Temple court and beyond.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Rabbi Akiva “far-off” means the distance from Modi’im to Jerusalem, about 30 km (I should know, I live in Modiin and travel to Jerusalem every day.  With traffic this takes between 45 minutes and an hour, but they didn’t have cars.  Then again, they didn’t have traffic either.  Modi’im is also where the Maccabees lived).  According to the Talmud it would take about half a spring day’s walk to get from Modi’im to Jerusalem.  The reason for half a day’s walk is that if he wanted to slaughter the pesah on time he had to get there while they were still doing so.  
Section two:  Rabbi Eliezer holds that “far-off” means anyone who was not actually in the Temple at that time.  This is somewhat perplexing—why should “far-off” mean one step away?  Rabbi Yose doesn’t answer this question but says that the dot on top of the heh in the word “far-off” (Numbers 9:10) hints that “far-off” is not to be taken literally.  If you look at a Torah or a Humash you will see that that dot is still there today.
