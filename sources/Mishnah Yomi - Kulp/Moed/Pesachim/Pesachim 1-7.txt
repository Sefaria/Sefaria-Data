Pesahim, Chapter One, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
In today’s mishnah Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yose argue over whether we may draw an analogy between the cases in the previous mishnah (burning together meats and oils of differing degrees of impurity) and the case of burning together clean and unclean terumah chametz on the eve of Pesah. 

Mishnah Seven
Rabbi Meir said: from their words we learn that we may burn clean terumah together with unclean terumah on Pesah.  
Rabbi Yose said: that is not a [proper] analogy.  
And Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua agree that each is burnt separately.
Concerning what do they disagree? In respect of doubtful [terumah] and unclean [terumah]:
Rabbi Eliezer says: each is burnt separately
But Rabbi Joshua rules: both together.

Explanation
Section one:  Rabbi Meir draws an analogy between the cases presented in yesterday’s mishnah and the case of burning impure terumah chametz with pure terumah chametz before Pesah.  The analogy is that in both cases it is permitted to increase levels of impurity in the process of burning something in order to get rid of it.  
Section two:  Rabbi Yose says that this is poor analogy.  In the cases in yesterday’s mishnah the meat or oil was already impure and the only issue was increasing its level of impurity. In the case of pure and impure terumah chametz we are talking about something pure. Therefore, they must burn both separately.
Section three:  Rabbi Yose continues to point out that both Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Eliezer agree that impure and pure terumah are not burnt together.  And if the two of them agree, then Rabbi Meir’s conclusion must be wrong.  
Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua disagreed only concerning the burning of doubtfully impure terumah with pure terumah.  Rabbi Eliezer is strict and rules that both must still be burnt separately, whereas Rabbi Joshua rules that since one is only doubtfully impure it may be burned with terumah that is certainly impure.
