[but] when transgressors   increased in number, they used to pluck them up and cast them on the roads.   [finally],   they ordained that the whole field should be declared ownerless property.

   	mishnah  . On the fifteenth thereof tables [of money changers]   were set up in the provinces.   On the twenty-fifth they were set up in the temple. When [the tables] were set up in the temple, they began to distrain.   Whom did they distrain? Levites and israelites,   proselytes and freed slaves,   but not women or slaves or minors.   A minor on whose behalf his father had begun to pay the shekel, may not discontinue it again. But no distraint was levied on the priests, in order to promote peacefulness.  

   	mishnah  . R. Judah said: ben bukri testified at jabneh that a priest who paid the shekel did not commit a sin.   But rabban johanan the son of zaccai said to him: not so, but a priest who did not pay the shekel was guilty of a sin. Only the priests expounded this verse [thus] for their own benefit: and every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt, it shall not be eaten:   if therefore the ‘omer   and the two loaves   and the shewbread   are [brought] from our [contributions], how can they be eaten?  

   	mishnah  . Although it was said that no distraint is levied on women or slaves or minors, [yet] if these paid the shekel it is accepted of them. If a heathen or a cuthean   paid the shekel it is not accepted of them. Likewise bird-offerings of men who had an issue,   and bird-offerings of women who had an issue,   and bird-offerings of women after childbirth,   and sin-offerings and guilt-offerings are not accepted of them. But vow-offerings   and freewill-offerings   are accepted of them. This is the general rule: all offerings which can be made as a vow-offering or a freewill-offering   are accepted of them, but offerings that cannot be made as a vow-offering or a freewill-offering   are not accepted of them. And thus it is explicitly stated in [the book of] ezra, where it is said: ye have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our god.  

   	mishnah  . The following are liable [to pay] a surcharge;   levites and israelites and proselytes and freed slaves;   but not priests or women or slaves or minors.   If a man paid the shekel on behalf of a priest, or on behalf of a woman, or on behalf of a slave, or on behalf of a minor, he is exempt.   If a man paid the shekel   on his own behalf and on behalf of his fellow he is liable to pay but one surcharge, r. Meir says: two surcharges. If one gave a sela’ and received a shekel,   he is liable to pay two surcharges.

   	mishnah  . If a man paid the shekel   on behalf of a poor man or on behalf of his neighbour or on behalf of his fellow-townsman, he is exempt [from a surcharge]. But if he did it as a loan to them he is liable. Brothers, who are partners,   are exempt from the tithe of cattle   when they are liable to a surcharge.   But when they are liable to the tithe of cattle   they are exempt from the surcharge.   And how much is the surcharge? A silver ma'ah.   Thus r. Meir. But the sages say: half a ma'ah.  

Mishnah  . Shekels may be changed  into darics  in order to [lighten] the load of the journey.  Just as there were chests  in the temple so were there chests in the province.  If the people of a town had sent their shekels and they were stolen or lost, then if the appropriation  had already been made  [the messengers] swear the oath [of acquittal]  to the treasurers; but if [the appropriation had] not [yet been made] they swear to the townspeople, and the townspeople must pay [fresh] shekels in the place of the [lost] shekels. [if the lost shekels] were found, or if the thieves restored them, then both [the first shekels and their substitutes] are [accounted sacred] shekels,  but they cannot be credited [to the account] of the coming year.  

   	mishnah  . If a man gave his shekel to his fellow to pay it on his behalf, but [his fellow] paid it   on behalf of himself, then if the appropriation had already been made   [his fellow] is guilty of sacrilege.   If a man paid his shekel out of money belonging to the sanctuary, then if the appropriation had already been made and an animal [bought out of the appropriation] had already been offered, he is guilty of sacrilege.   [if he did it with money which was] the value of second tithes   or the value of seventh year produce,   he must consume [food to] the value thereof.  

   	mishnah  . If a man saved coins and said: lo, these are for my shekel, beth shammai say: the surplus [of the coins goes to the chests of] freewill-offerings.   But beth hillel say: the surplus thereof is common property.   [if he said: from these coins] i shall offer my shekel, [both schools] agree that the surplus thereof is common property. [if he said]: these [coins] are for a sin-offering, [both] agree   that the surplus [goes to the chests of] freewill-offerings. [if he said]: from these i shall offer a sin-offering, [both schools] agree that the surplus is common property.

   	mishnah  . R. Simeon said: what is the difference between shekels and a sin-offering?   Shekels have a fixed value, but a sin-offering has no fixed value.   R. Judah says: shekels also have no fixed value. For when the israelites came up out of the captivity   they used to pay the shekel in darics,   then they paid the shekel in sela's   then again they paid it in tib'in,   and finally they sought to pay it in denars.   But r. Simeon said: nevertheless the value thereof remained the same for everybody, whereas [in the case of] a sin-offering one man may bring it of the value of one sela’, another may bring it of the value of two sela's, and again another of three sela's.

Mishnah  . The surplus of [money set aside for] shekels is common property, but the surplus of [money set aside for the] tenth of the ephah,   and the surplus of [money set aside for] bird-offerings of men who had an issue, for bird-offerings of women who had an issue, for bird-offerings of women after childbirth,   their surplus [goes to the chests of] freewill-offerings. This is the general rule: of all [monies set aside] for a sin-offering or for a guilt-offering, the surplus [goes to the chests of] freewill-offerings. The surplus of [money set aside for] a burnt-offering [must be used] for a burnt-offering; the surplus of [money set aside for] a meal-offering [must be used] for a meal-offering; the surplus of [money set aside for] a peace-offering [must be used] for a peace-offering; the surplus of [money set aside for] a passover-offering [must be used] for a passover-offering; the surplus of [money raised for] the offerings of nazirites   [must be used] for the offerings of other nazirites; the surplus of [money raised for] the offerings of a [particular] nazirite [must go] to the [chests of] freewill-offerings; the surplus of [money raised for] the poor [must be used] for [other] poor; the surplus of [money raised for] a [particular] poor person   [must be given] to that [poor person];   the surplus of [money raised for the ransom of] captives [must be used] for [the ransom of other] captives; the surplus of [money raised for the ransom of] a [particular] captive [must be given] to that captive; the surplus of [the money raised for the burial of] the dead [must be used] for [the burial of other] dead; the surplus of [the money raised for the burial of] a [particular] dead person [must be given] to his heirs. R. Meir says: the surplus of [money raised for the burial of] a [particular] dead person must be laid aside until elijah comes.   R. Nathan says: the surplus of [money raised for the burial of] a [particular] dead person [must be used] for building a monument for him over his grave.  
Mishnah  . At three periods of the year was the appropriation made [from the shekels] in the chamber:  half a month  before the passover, half a month before pentecost, and half a month before the feast of tabernacles. These are also the seasons  for the tithe of cattle;  thus r. Akiba. Ben ‘azzai says: on the twenty-ninth of adar,  and on the first of sivan,  and on the twenty-ninth of ab.  R. Eleazar and r. Simeon say: on the first of nisan,  on the first of sivan,  and on the twenty-ninth of elul. Wherefore did they say, on the twenty-ninth of elul and not on the first of tishri?  Because the first of tishri is a festival,  and it is not permitted to tithe on a festival, therefore they advance it to the twenty-ninth of elul.

   	mishnah  . The appropriation in the chamber was made with three baskets each of [the capacity of] three se'ahs,   and on them was inscribed [respectively]   aleph, beth, gimel. R. Ishmael says: on them was inscribed in greek, alpha, beta, gamla.   He who made the appropriation did not enter the chamber wearing either a bordered   cloak or shoes or sandals or tefillin or an amulet, lest if he became poor people might say that he became poor because of an iniquity committed in the chamber, or if he became rich people might say that he became rich from the appropriation in the chamber. For it is a man's duty to be free of blame   before men as before god, as it is said: and be guiltless towards the lord and towards israel,   and again it says: so shall  thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of god and man.  

   	mishnah  . [members] of rabban gamaliel's household used to enter [the chamber] with their shekel between their fingers, and throw it in front of him who made the appropriation, while he who made the appropriation purposely pressed it into the basket.   He who made the appropriation did not make it unless he first said to them:   shall i make the appropriation? And they said to him three times:   make the appropriation! Make the appropriation! Make the appropriation!
	mishnah  . When he made the first appropriation   he covered [what was left] with leather spreads,   and when he made the second appropriation   he again covered [what was left] with leather spreads,   but after the third appropriation he did not cover [what was left]. [he covered after the first two appropriations] lest he should forget and make a [fresh] appropriation from shekels from which an appropriation had already been made. The first appropriation he made on behalf of the land of israel, and the second on behalf of the cities near thereunto, and the third on behalf of babylon and on behalf of media and on behalf of [other] distant countries.  
Mishnah  . What was done with the appropriation? They brought therewith the daily burnt-offerings  and the additional  burnt-offerings and their drink-offerings, the ‘omer and the two loaves and the shewbread  and all the other public offerings.  Those who watched the aftergrowths  in the seventh year  received their wages out of the appropriation from the chamber. R. Jose says: [if a man wished] he could volunteer to watch without payment. But they said to him: thou, too, dost admit that they  can only be offered out of public funds. 

   	mishnah  . The [red] cow  and the scapegoat   and the strip of scarlet   came out of the appropriation of the chamber. The viaduct for the [red] cow   and the viaduct for the scapegoat   and the strip of scarlet which was between its horns,   and [the maintenance of] the pool of water,   and the wall of the city   and the towers thereof and all the needs of the city   came out of the remainder   in the chamber. Abba saul says: the viaduct for the [red] cow the high priests made out of their own [means].

   	mishnah  . What was done with the surplus of the remainder in the chamber?   Therewith were bought wines, oils and fine flours,   and the profit belonged to the sanctuary; thus r. Ishmael. R. Akiba says: one may not deal with the property of the sanctuary,   nor with the property of the poor.  

   	mishnah  . What was done with the surplus of the appropriation?   [thereof were made] beaten plates of gold for covering   the interior of the holy of holies. R. Ishmael says: the surplus [from the sale] of the produce   was used for the altar's ‘dessert’,   and the surplus of the appropriation was used for the vessels of ministration. R. Akiba says: the surplus of the appropriation was used for the altar's ‘dessert’, and the surplus of the drink-offerings   was used for the vessels of ministration. R. Hananiah the chief of the priests   says: the surplus of the drink-offerings was used for the altar's ‘dessert’, and the surplus of the appropriation was used for the vessels of ministration. Neither of these [two sages] allowed [a profit from the sale of the produce.  
Mishnah  . What was done with the surplus of the frankincense?   They set apart therefrom   the wages of the craftsmen,   and when they had exchanged it   for the wages of the craftsmen, they gave it to the craftsmen as their wages, and then they bought it back again out of a new appropriation.   If the new one   had arrived in time they bought it back again with the new appropriation, but if not, they bought it back again with the old one.

   	mishnah  . If a man dedicated his possessions to the sanctuary, and there was among them aught that was fit for public offerings,   it should be given to the craftsmen as their wages; thus r. Akiba. But ben ‘azzai said to him: this is not in accordance with the established rule.   Nay, rather, they set apart therefrom   the wages of the craftsmen, and when they had exchanged it for the money due to the craftsmen they gave it to the craftsmen as their wages, and then they bought it back again out of a new appropriation.

   	mishnah  . If a man dedicated his possessions to the sanctuary and there were among them cattle fit for the altar, males or females, r. Eliezer says: males should be sold   for the use of burnt-offerings and females   should be sold for the use of peace-offerings, and the price thereof together with the rest of the possessions should go to the repair of the temple.   R. Joshua says: the males should themselves be offered up as burnt-offerings   and the females should be sold for the use of peace-offerings, [and for the price thereof burnt-offerings should be offered],   and the other possessions should go to the repair of the temple. R. Akiba says: i prefer the opinion of r. Eliezer above the opinion of r. Joshua, for r. Eliezer applied a uniform rule,   but r. Joshua differentiated.   R. Papias said: i have heard a tradition in accordance with the opinions of both [sages]: that if a man dedicated to the sanctuary in definite terms   it is according to the opinion of r. Eliezer,   but if he dedicated to the sanctuary in indefinite terms   it is according to the opinion of r. Joshua.  
	mishnah  . If a man dedicated his possessions to the sanctuary and there were among them things fit for the altar [such as] wines, oils,   and birds,   r. Eliezer says: they should be sold for the use of [offerings belonging to] each particular kind, and for the price thereof burnt-offerings   should be offered, while the other possessions should go to the repair of the temple.

   	mishnah  . Once in thirty days prices were fixed [on behalf of] the chamber.   If a man had undertaken to supply fine flours at four [se'ahs for a sela’] and they now stood at three [se'ahs for a sela’] he must [still] supply at four [se'ahs]. [if he had undertaken to supply] at three [se'ahs for a sela’] and they now stood at four, he must [also] supply at four, for the sanctuary has the upper hand.   If the fine flour became worm-eaten the loss is his; if the wine became sour the loss is his. For he is not entitled to his money   except after the altar has accepted the offering.    
Mishnah  . These were the officers  in the temple: johanan the son of phineas was over the seals, ahijah over the drink-offerings,  mattithiah the son of samuel  over the lots,  pethahiah over the bird-offerings (this same pethahiah was mordecai. Wherefore was his name called pethahiah? Because he ‘opened’  matters and expounded them, and he understood the seventy tongues);  the son of ahijah was over the sickness of the bowels,  nehuniah was digger of ditches,  gebini was the crier,  the son of geber was over the locking of the gates,   the son of bebai was over the strips,   the son of arza over the cymbal,   hygros the son of levi over the singing,   the house of garmu over the making of the shewbread,   the house of abtinas over the preparing of the frankincense,   eleazar over the veil,   and phineas over the vestments.  

   	mishnah  . The treasurers were not less than three and the superintendents not less than seven, nor may authority be exercised in matters of money by less than two [officers], except [in the case] of ahijah   who was over the sickness of the bowels and eleazar   who was over the veil, for these had been accepted by the majority of   the public.

   	mishnah  . There were four seals in the temple, and on them was inscribed [respectively] ‘calf’, ‘ram’,   ‘kid’, ‘sinner’.   Ben ‘azzai says: there were five and on them was inscribed in aramaic [respectively] ‘calf’, ‘ram’, ‘kid’, ‘poor   sinner’, and ‘rich   sinner’. [the seal inscribed] ‘calf’, served for the drink-offerings   of kine, both great and small, male and female; [the one inscribed] ‘kid’ served for the drink-offerings of flocks, both great and small, male and female, with the exception of those of rams; [the one inscribed] ‘ram’ served for the drink-offerings of rams alone; [the one inscribed] ‘sinner’ served for the drink-offerings of the three animals [offered] by lepers.  
Mishnah  . If a man required drink-offerings he would go to johanan who was the officer over the seals, and give him money and receive from him a seal. Then he would go to ahijah who was the officer over the drink-offerings, and give him the seal, and receive from him drink-offerings. And in the evening these two [officers] would come together, and ahijah would bring out the seals and receive money for their value. And if there was more [than their value] the surplus belonged to the sanctuary,   but if there was less [than their value] johanan would pay [the loss] out of his own means; for the sanctuary has the upper hand.

   	mishnah  . If a man lost his seal his case was deferred until the evening.   If then they found [money over] to the value of his lost seal they gave [it] to him, put if not he had nothing. Moreover, on the seals was inscribed the name of the day [in order to guard] against impostors.  

   	mishnah  . There were two chambers in the temple, one the chamber of secret gifts and the other the chamber of the vessels. The chamber of secret gifts — sin-fearing persons   used to put their gifts therein in secret, and the poor who were descended of the virtuous were supported therefrom in secret. The chamber of the vessels — whoever offered a vessel as a gift used to throw it therein, and once in thirty days the treasurers opened it; and any vessel they found therein that was of use for the repair of the temple they left there; but the others were sold and their price went to the chamber of the repair   of the temple.  
Mishnah  . If a man required drink-offerings he would go to johanan who was the officer over the seals, and give him money and receive from him a seal.

   	mishnah  . There were two chambers in the temple, one the chamber of secret gifts and the other the chamber of the vessels. The chamber of secret gifts — sin-fearing persons   used to put their gifts therein in secret, and the poor who were descended of the virtuous were supported therefrom in secret. The chamber of the vessels — whoever offered a vessel as a gift used to throw it therein, and once in thirty days the treasurers opened it; and any vessel they found therein that was of use for the repair of the temple they left there; but the others were sold and their price went to the chamber of the repair   of the temple.
