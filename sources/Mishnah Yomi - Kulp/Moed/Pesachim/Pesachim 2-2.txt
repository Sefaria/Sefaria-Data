Pesahim, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah and tomorrow’s mishnah complete the chronologically ordered discussion about removing chametz.  (In chapter three the mishnah will discuss what exactly chametz is, and which chametz must be removed.)  While we were previously discussing the day before Pesah, these mishnayot skip ahead until after Pesah and rule what is to be done with chametz that was not destroyed before Pesah.

Mishnah Two
Chametz which belongs to a gentile over which Pesach has passed is permitted for benefit; 
But that of an Israelite is forbidden for benefit, as it is said, “No leavened bread shall be found with you.”

Explanation
Section one:  A Jew may eat chametz that a gentile owned on Pesah since there is no prohibition for a gentile to own chametz on Pesah. The phrase “over which Pesah has passed” means that the chametz existed during Pesah.
Section two:  However, a Jew may not eat or derive any benefit from chametz that any Jew (himself or other) owned over Pesah.  Practically this is a very significant issue in the modern world.  If a store owned by a Jew does not either get rid of or sell its chametz before Pesah a Jew may not eat that chametz even after Pesah. In Israel restaurants and food stores hang up signs which guarantee that they have sold their chametz before Pesah.  
The midrash at the end of this mishnah presents the prohibition for possessing chametz.  According to the Talmud, since the Jew did not get rid of his chametz before Pesah, he is punished and it becomes for him or any other Jew to derive benefit from it every again.
