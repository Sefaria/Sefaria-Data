Pesahim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Four

Introduction 
This mishnah teaches what happens if a person registers others to share with him in his portion of the pesah.  

Mishnah Four
If one registers others with him [to share] in his portion, the members of the company are permitted to give him his [portion], and he eats his and they eat theirs.

Explanation
The person in this mishnah registers others to eat his portion of the pesah but he doesn’t tell the other members of the company.  When they find out they don’t want to share their pesah with this person.  What they may do is tell their friend that he can share his portion with those who registered with him and that they are not going to share their portion.  He and those who registered with him eat his portion and the other people eat theirs.  In essence, he has made his own new eating company.
