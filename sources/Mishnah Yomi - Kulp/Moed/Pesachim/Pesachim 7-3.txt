Pesahim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Three

Introduction
The two sections of this mishnah deal with a person who basted their pesah with oils that are restricted by who can eat them or where they can be eaten.  The mishnah deals with the consequences of such an action.
 
Mishnah Three
If he basted it [the pesah] with oil of terumah:
If they who registered for it are a company of priests, they may eat [it]. 
But if Israelites, 
if it is [still] raw, they may wash it off; 
if it is roasted, he must pare the outer part. 
If he anointed it with oil of second tithe, he must not charge its value for the members of the company, because second tithe must not be redeemed in Jerusalem.

Explanation
Section one:  Terumah oil can only be eaten by priests.  If the pesah which has been basted with terumah oil is intended for a company of priests, then they may still eat it.  However, a company of Israelites cannot eat the oil. If the pesah is still raw they may wash it off, dry it (so that it won’t be cooked with water) and then roast it. Washing it off is a valid way of removing the oil.  If they basted it with the terumah oil and then roasted it, the oil has sunk into the pesah.  What they must do is pare off the outer layer of the pesah’s meat. This meat cannot be eaten by the Israelites because it has terumah oil cooked into it.  
Section two:  Second tithe is usually redeemed for money, the money is brought to Jerusalem and it is used there to buy food.  However, second tithe that has arrived in Jerusalem without being redeemed may not be redeemed there.  Therefore, if a person has basted his company’s pesah offering with second tithe he may not charge the other members of the company for the value of the oil since this would be a form of redeeming the second tithe in Jerusalem, the only place where the pesah can be eaten.
