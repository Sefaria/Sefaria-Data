Pesahim, Chapter Two, Mishnah Seven

Introduction 
This mishnah returns to discussing the prohibition of chametz on Pesah. 

Mishnah Seven
One may not soak bran for fowls, but one may scald it. 
A woman may not soak bran to take with her to the bathhouse, but she may rub dry [bran] on her skin . 
And a man may not chew wheat and place it on his wound, because it turns into chametz.

Explanation
All three sections of this mishnah teach that one must avoid letting grains come into contact with water on Pesah because this allows them to turn into chametz.  
We should note that today religious Jews do not keep grain in their possession on Pesah, nor do they bake matzot during Pesah.  In the time of the Talmud Jews did not get rid of dry grains, grains which had not yet become chametz and when they needed to, they did bake matzah on Pesah.  This mishnah deals with what one may do and not do with grain on Pesah.
Section one:  Soaking bran will lead it to become chametz.  However, putting it in boiling water will not cause it to become chametz because the hot water arrests the leavening process.
Section two:  Soaked bran was used by women to cleanse their skin in the bathhouse.  She may not soak the bran before she goes to the bathhouse because that will cause it to become chametz.  However, she may rub dry bran directly on her skin even though her skin is moist.
Section three:  Chewed wheat was used as a salve for wounds.  When he chews it he gets the wheat wet, thereby making it likely to become chametz.  Hence, this is forbidden.
On a small note concerning gender, it is interesting that men are wounded and women go to the bathhouse.
