Pesahim, Chapter Two, Mishnah Three

Introduction
The first section of this mishnah discusses chametz which was used to secure a loan.  The second half deals with chametz upon which a large pile of stones has fallen.
  
Mishnah Three
If a gentile lent [money] to an Israelite on his chametz, after Pesah it is permitted for use. 
But if an Israelite lent [money] to a gentile on his chametz, after Pesah it is prohibited for use.  
If ruins fell on chametz it is as if it is has been removed.   
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: provided that a dog cannot search it out.

Explanation
Section one:  A gentile lent money to a Jew and the Jew used his chametz as a collateral to secure the loan.  According to the Talmud, the Jew said to the non-Jew, “If I don’t come [to claim my chametz] before Pesach it is sold to you.”  In such a case, the chametz belongs fully to the non-Jew when Pesach arrives and therefore a Jew may benefit from it after Pesach has passed.
Section two:  This is the opposite case—a Jew lent money to a gentile before Pesach and the gentile used his chametz as collateral for the loan.  He said to the Jew, “If I don’t come [to claim my chametz] before Pesach it is sold to you.”  When Pesach comes this chametz fully belongs to the Jew.  Therefore, a Jew may not derive any benefit from it after Pesach.  
Section three:  Chametz which is totally inaccessible because ruins—a large pile of stones—have fallen on it, need not be removed from a person’s property before Pesach. This is because the owner of the property does not consider this to be his chametz anymore, and indeed it is highly unlikely that he will ever again have access to it.  
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel clarifies that in order for chametz upon which ruins have fallen to be considered destroyed, it has to be buried deep enough that a dog wouldn’t search after it. According to the Talmud, this is three handbreadths deep.
