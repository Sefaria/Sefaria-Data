Pesahim, Chapter One, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah continues yesterday’s mishnah in which we learned that they need not check places into which chametz is not brought. 

Mishnah Two
They need not fear that a weasel may have dragged [chametz] from one room to another or from one place to another, for if so, [they must also fear] from courtyard to courtyard and from town to town, and there would be no end to the matter. 

Explanation
There are two basic explanations to this mishnah.  Some explain that once a room has been searched for chametz, they need not recheck the room lest a weasel dragged chametz into it after it had been searched.  [In my house, my 1 ½ year old son is our little weasel, dragging chametz all over the place.  Since I know he does this and I see him do it, I do check.]  
The Rambam explains that they need not check a room into which chametz is not brought, lest a weasel brought chametz into there.
If we were to have such fears, they would never end and there would be no meaning to the statement in yesterday’s mishnah that we need not check a place into which chametz is not brought.   Alternatively, even once a room had been checked, it would have to be constantly rechecked lest a weasel had dragged chametz into there.
