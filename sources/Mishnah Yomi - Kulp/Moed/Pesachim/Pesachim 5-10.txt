Pesahim, Chapter Five, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
This mishnah completes the description of the sacrificial aspects of the pesah sacrifice.  In chapter seven we will describe how it is roasted so that it could be eaten. 

Mishnah Ten
Then he tore it and took out its inner fats, placed them in a tray and burnt them on the altar.
The first division went out and sat down on the Temple mount, the second [sat] in the hel, while the third remained in its place. 
When it grew dark they went out and roasted their pesah lambs.

Explanation
Section one:  After the animal was flayed he would tear a hole in it and take out the fats that need to be sacrificed on the altar. We should note that non-priests could do the flaying and the tearing but that only the priest could offer the fats on the altar.
Section two:  At this point, the sacrificial elements have been completed and the animal is ready to be roasted.  On a weekday, the people would now take the sacrifice back to their homes or to wherever in Jerusalem they were planning to eat the pesah meal.  However, if the eve of Pesah fell on Shabbat they could not carry the pesah out of the Temple confines.  So therefore each division would remain in a certain place.  The first division would go out of the Temple and sit on the Temple mount, the second division would sit in the hel, a place right outside the courtyard and the third division remained in the courtyard.  When Shabbat was over they would go home and roast their lambs.
