Pesahim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Eleven

Introduction
This mishnah is similar to that which we learned yesterday except instead of the pesah sacrifices of companies being mixed up the pesah sacrifices of two individuals are mixed up.  

Mishnah Eleven
If the pesah sacrifices belonging to two [individuals] became mixed up, each takes possession of one [animal]; 
This one registers someone from the marketplace with him and that one registers someone from the marketplace with him. 
This one goes over to that one and that one goes over to this one, and thus  they declare: “If this pesah is mine, your hands are withdrawn from yours and you are registered for mine; while if this pesah is yours, my hands are withdrawn from mine and I am registered for yours.”

Explanation
The key to understanding this mishnah is that each person needs to register another person with him (one from the marketplace) for his pesah otherwise when he switches to the other person’s group a pesah will be left temporarily without any owners, and this is prohibited.  I shall explain the scenario using proper names. Let’s say Reuven and Shimon have their pesah sacrifices mixed up.   If Reuven were to even temporarily withdraw from his and register for Shimon’s his would be left without any owner.  Therefore, Reuven signs up Moshe and Shimon signs up Aharon, and now there are two companies as opposed to two individuals.  One person will now always “stay behind”.  Reuven and Shimon each take an animal, and Moshe leaves Reuven’s group and goes to Shimon’s and Aharon leaves Shimon’s group and goes to Reuven’s.  Reuven then makes the declaration to Aharon and Shimon makes the declaration to Moshe.  In this way both groups have a pesah and neither pesah was ever left without an owner.
