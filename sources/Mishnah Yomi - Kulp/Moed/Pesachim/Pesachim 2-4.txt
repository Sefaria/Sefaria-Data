Pesahim, Chapter Two, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a non-priest who eats on Pesah terumah which is also chametz.  The case is either one in which before Pesah he separated terumah from his chametz or that he separated terumah from his matzah on Pesah and it became chametz.

Mishnah Four
One who unwittingly eats terumah chametz on Pesah must repay [to a priest] the principal plus a fifth.
Intentionally, he is exempt from payment and from [liability for] its value as fuel.

Explanation
Section one:  If he eats this terumah chametz unwittingly, he is liable for what one is normally liable to pay when a non-priest eats terumah.  He must repay the value of the terumah and an added fifth to a priest (see Leviticus 22:14).  Even though it was forbidden for him to derive benefit from the chametz on Pesah and therefore it is as if the chametz is not worth anything, still he makes restitution based on the size of the terumah that he ate and not its monetary value.  The chametz may not have any value but it has size.
Section two:  Normally speaking, when not Pesah, one who intentionally eats terumah is liable to repay the value of the terumah which he ate.  He is treated like a robber, who pays the value of that which he robbed.  Since the chametz terumah is worthless on Pesah—a Jew cannot derive any benefit from it—he is not liable for anything.  The mishnah goes on to say he is not even liable for the value of the terumah chametz had it been used as fuel, since on Pesah not only is eating the chametz prohibited, but deriving any benefit from it is as well.
