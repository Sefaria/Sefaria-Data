Pesahim, Chapter Five, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
The first section of the mishnah teaches that the sacrificial ritual was performed on Shabbat the same way that it was performed during the week.  The second section discusses a practice done in order to ensure that blood from each of the lambs had been poured out onto the altar. 

Mishnah Eight
As it was done on weekdays so it was done on Shabbat, except that the priests would mop up the Temple court, against the will of the sages. 
Rabbi Judah says:  he [a priest] would fill a goblet with the mixed blood [and] he sprinkled it once on the altar, but the sages did not agree with him.

Explanation
Section one:  The ritual was performed on Shabbat in the exact same manner that it was performed during the week.  However, the sages would have liked to have seen one difference in how the ritual was performed on Shabbat.  As they did during the week, so too on Shabbat the priests would mop up the floor of the Temple courtyard, which had surely become quite dirty with the blood from the many sacrifices.  They did this against the will of the sages who thought that mopping up the floor is prohibited on Shabbat.  As an aside, we can detect here a note of dissonance between the sages and the priests who ran the Temple.  Clearly, these priests did not feel themselves subject to the sagesâ€™ authority.
Section two:  Rabbi Judah relates that a priest would fill a goblet with the mixed blood that he found on the floor and then pour the contents of the goblet onto the altar.  The reason he would do this is lest the blood of one of the sacrifices had not been sprinkled on the altar.  Not having its blood spilled on the altar would render the sacrifice invalid. It was assumed that some of the blood of all of the animals would be in this mixture and therefore pouring it out was sort of an insurance policy.  The sages did not agree with Rabbi Judah that this was done in the Temple.
