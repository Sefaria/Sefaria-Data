Pesahim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah One
 
Introduction
Exodus 12:9 states that the pesah must be roasted and that it may not be cooked with water.  Today’s mishnah and the following one deal with how the pesah is roasted such that there is no water or even hint thereof used in the process.  

Mishnah One  
How is the pesah roasted? 
They bring a spit of pomegranate wood and thrust it into its mouth [right down] as far as its buttocks, and place its legs and its entrails inside it, the words of Rabbi Yose the Galilean. 
Rabbi Akiva says: this is like boiling, rather they are hung outside it.

Explanation
Section one:  The pesah is roasted in an oven while on a spit. The spit is made of pomegranate wood, the driest of woods, so that there is as little moisture used in the process as possible.  Exodus 12:9 also states that the pesah should be cooked “roasted, head, legs and entrails.”  The Hebrew in this verse is oddly phrased and could be translated as “its head, on its legs and entrails.”  Rabbi Yose the Galilean interprets this to mean that the legs and entrails, once cut off or removed, should be stuffed into the pesah itself and then roasted inside of it.
Section two:  Rabbi Akiva disagrees and holds that this would be like boiling the entrails and legs inside the pesah, and any cooking with moisture is forbidden.  Rather the entrails and legs are hung on the spit outside the pesah and they are roasted separately.  The verse merely means to emphasize that the whole thing must be roasted.
