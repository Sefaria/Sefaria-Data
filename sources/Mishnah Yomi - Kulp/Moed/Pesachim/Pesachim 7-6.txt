Pesahim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Six

Introduction 
This mishnah provides the basic laws concerning when the pesah sacrifice is offered in “uncleanness.”  We should note that the form of impurity/uncleanness to which this topic refers to is one who has come into contact with a dead body.   

Mishnah Six
If the community or the majority thereof was unclean, or if the priests were unclean and the community clean, they make [the pesah sacrifice] in uncleanness. 
If a minority of the community were unclean: those who are clean observe the first [Pesah], while those who are unclean observe the second.

Explanation
Section one:  The pesah sacrifice is offered in uncleanness only if either a majority of the community of Israel was unclean or if the priests were unclean.  In one of these two situations, they offer the sacrifice on the fourteenth of Nisan, its usual date.
Section two:  If, however, only a minority of the community were unclean, then the laws of Numbers 9 apply.  Those who are clean offer the pesah on the fourteenth of Nisan while those who are unclean are given a second chance, on the fourteenth of Iyyar.
