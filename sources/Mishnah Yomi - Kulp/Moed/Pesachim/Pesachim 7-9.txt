Pesahim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Nine

Introduction 
This mishnah continues to deal with a pesah sacrifice, one that has already been slaughtered, that must be burned because it has been disqualified. 

Mishnah Nine
A pesah which went out [beyond the walls of Jerusalem] or was defiled must be burned immediately.   
If its owners were defiled or they died, its form must change and [then] it is burned on the sixteenth [of Nisan]. 
Rabbi Yohanan ben Berokah says: this too must be burned immediately, because there are none to eat it.

Explanation
Section one:   The pesah, once slaughtered, cannot be brought outside of the walls of Jerusalem.  If it does it is disqualified.  A pesah that has been disqualified, either by becoming defiled or by being brought beyond the walls of Jerusalem must be burned immediately, on the fourteenth of Nisan.
Section two: In this case the pesah itself did not become disqualified but rather those who were supposed to eat it were either disqualified or died.  The pesah itself now has no one that can eat it.  According to the first opinion, it is not burned immediately but rather they wait until the following night, when its form has already begun to change.  “Form changing” does not refer to the pesah’s physical form but to its halakhic form—it is now “remainder” and must be burned.  Note that it could not be burned on the fifteenth because the fifteenth is a festival day and sanctified meat which has been disqualified is not burned on a festival.  
Rabbi Yohanan ben Berokah says that this pesah, which has no one to eat it (poor little lamby) is treated the same as if the pesah itself had become disqualified.  It is burned immediately on the fourteenth and they do not wait until it becomes “remainder.”
