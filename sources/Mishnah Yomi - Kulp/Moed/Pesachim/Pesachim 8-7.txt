Pesahim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Seven

Introduction 
This mishnah continues to deal with how the company of those who would together eat the pesah was formed.

Mishnah Seven
They may not slaughter the pesah for a single person, the words of Rabbi Judah. 
But Rabbi Yose permits it. 
And even a company of a hundred who cannot eat as much as an olive, one may not slaughter [a pesah] for them. 
And one may not form a company of women and slaves and minors.

Explanation
Section one: The problem with slaughtering the pesah for a single person is that it is highly unlikely that he will be able to eat the whole thing.  In all likelihood, a large portion of it will become “remainder”—and it is prohibited to let any of the pesah remain uneaten until the morning. Therefore, Rabbi Judah forbids slaughtering the pesah for a single person.  Rabbi Yose permits it, assuming that the person will be able to eat the entire pesah (a Homer Simpsonesque pesah feast).  
Section two:  While Rabbi Yose allows one to slaughter a pesah for a single person who can eat the whole thing he does not allow slaughtering for a large group that can certainly together eat the whole thing unless each person can eat as much as an olive’s worth.
Section three:  There are two different explanations for this section.  According to one explanation, it is forbidden to have a company that is all women, all slaves or all minors.  According to another explanation, it is forbidden to have a company mixed with slaves and women for fear of licentiousness.  This is a common theme with regard to slaves—they are considered to be sexually licentious.
