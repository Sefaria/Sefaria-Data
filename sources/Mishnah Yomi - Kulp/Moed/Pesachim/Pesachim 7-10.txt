Pesahim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Ten

Introduction 
This mishnah teaches when the uneaten parts of the pesah are to be burned.  

Mishnah Ten
The bones, and the sinews, and the “remainder” [of the pesah] are burned on the sixteenth.  
If the sixteenth falls on Shabbat, they are burned on the seventeenth, because they do not override either Shabbat or the festival.

Explanation
Section one:  Exodus 12:10 states, “Do not leave any of it [the pesah] until morning, and anything which remains in the morning must be burned in fire.”  This is the law of “remainder” referred to in our mishnah and in the mishnayot above.  However, this refers to the edible meat—it is unclear why one has to burn the bones and sinews which are not edible.  One opinion explains that the marrow of the bones is edible, so therefore the bones must be burned as well.  The sinews to which the mishnah refers are sinews which are edible.  Another explanation is that the bones and sinews are not edible but they are burned in any case in order to prevent people from thinking that they can eat their pesah the next day.  In other words, the halakhah tells people to burn everything that is left so that they will be careful and not eat the remaining meat. 
Section two:  Burning the “remainder” does not override the Shabbat or festival prohibition against burning.  Burning the “remainder” is a positive commandment and not burning on Shabbat or the festival is considered to be both a positive and a negative commandment.  Generally, a positive commandment does not override one which has both a positive and negative aspect.  Therefore, the pesah is normally burned on the sixteenth, the day after the first day of the festival, but if the sixteenth falls on Shabbat it is burned on the seventeenth.
