Hagigah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Six

Introduction 
Our mishnah continues to deal with the question of when to trust a person when he says that he has not made vessels impure.

Mishnah Six
Tax-collectors who entered a house, and similarly thieves who restored [stolen] vessels are believed if they say, “We have not touched [anything].”   
And in Jerusalem they are believed in regard to sacred things, and during a festival also in regard to terumah.

Explanation
Section one:  The mishnah refers to a tax collector who has taken someone’s possessions in order to use them as collateral for a tax debt.  When he returns the object to its owner he is believed if he says that he didn’t make the object impure.  The same is true for the thief who is returning something he had stolen. It seems that these people are believed specifically because they are doing “teshuvah”, repentance, by returning the stolen/collected item. Since they are repenting, they are at the same time believed with regard to other aspects of religious law.
Some commentators say that these people are believed if the item is going to be used for sacrifices, because even tax collectors and thieves respect the purity of sacrifices. But they are not believed with regard to terumah.  Other commentators say that they are believed for both.  
Section two: Amei Haaretz (uneducated people) are believed when they are in Jerusalem to say that their vessels are pure so that they could be used with sacrifices.  During a festival their trustworthiness is even greater because everybody, even the uneducated, would purify themselves before the festival. Therefore they are even believed with regard to terumah.
