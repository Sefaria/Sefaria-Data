Hagigah, Chapter One, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah teaches that if one did not bring the hagigah offering on the first day of the festival, he has the rest of the festival to bring it.  This is derived from Leviticus 23:41 which says, “You shall observe it as a festival of the Lord for seven days”—implying that the hagigah can be brought throughout the festival.

Mishnah Six 
He who did not bring his hagigah on the first day of the festival of Sukkot, may bring it during the whole of the festival, even on the last festival day of Sukkot. 
If the festival, passed and he did not bring the festival offering, he is no longer liable for it. Of such a person it is said: “A twisted thing cannot be made straight, a lack cannot be made good” (Ecclesiastes 1:15).  

Explanation
Section one: Even though the last day of Sukkot is a different festival called Shmini Atzeret, nevertheless even on this day one can bring his hagigah offering and have it count as his Sukkot hagigah.
Section two: Once the festival is over, he cannot bring the hagigah offering.  Even if he set aside an animal to be a hagigah and then it was lost during the festival and found afterwards, he cannot offer that animal as a hagigah.  In such a case the animal would be offered as a freewill offering.  The mistake of not bringing the hagigah during the correct time is a “lack that cannot be made good.”
