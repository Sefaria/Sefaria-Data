Hagigah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Another two stringencies for sacred things.

Mishnah Three
They may eat dry foods with impure hands when it comes to terumah, but not when it comes to sacred things.
The one who has not yet buried his dead (an onen) and one who lacks atonement require immersion for sacred things but not for terumah. 

Explanation
Section one:  Wet food is susceptible to impurity whereas dry food is not (see Leviticus 11:34, 38).  This is true in all cases except for the case of sacred food.  The idea is that “the love of the sacred makes it susceptible to impurity.”  [This is a fascinating concept, demonstrating well that the concept of sacredness and susceptible to impurity are intimately connected.] Therefore one cannot eat sacred food with impure hands, even if the hands are dry.  Terumah is like normal food and doesn’t receive impurity unless it becomes wet.
Section two:  When one of a person’s seven close relatives dies, he/she is an onen on that day and the night thereafter.  An onen may not eat sacrifices.  Similarly a person who needed to bring certain sacrifices in order to complete his period of impurity (such as a leper, see Leviticus 14:10) cannot eat other sacrifices until he brings these mandated sacrifices.  The rabbis decreed that before these people can eat sacrifices they must go to the mikveh.  This immersion would aid in the transition between their former state of not being able to eat sacrifices to a state of being able to eat sacrifices.  In contrast, an onen and a formerly impure person who had not brought sacrifices can eat terumah, therefore upon the completion of the period of being an onen and after bringing the sacrifice he may continue to eat terumah without another immersion.
