Betzah, Chapter  Three, Mishnah Two

Introduction
In yesterday’s mishnah we learned that one may not hunt (trap) animals on Yom Tov because he could do it the day before. Today we learn about taking animals out of traps on Yom Tov when the traps were set before Yom Tov.

Mishnah Two 
Traps for wild animals, birds or fish which were set on the eve of Yom Tov, one may not take from them on Yom Tov unless he knows that they were [already] caught on the eve of Yom Tov.
It once happened that a certain non-Jew brought fish to Rabban Gamaliel [on Yom Tov] and he said: they are permitted, but I have no wish to accept [them] from him.

Explanation
Section one:  If the animals, birds or fish were caught in the traps the day before Yom Tov it would be permitted to take them out and slaughter them on Yom Tov.  However, if they were trapped on Yom Tov then they are muktzeh because they could not have been used when Yom Tov began. When Yom Tov began he would have still had to trap them and trapping is prohibited on Yom Tov.  If he finds them in the traps on Yom Tov he cannot use them unless he knows for certain that they were caught before Yom Tov.  According to this opinion, something that is “doubtful muktzeh”, meaning it might or might not be muktzeh, it is prohibited.
Section two:  In this story we see that Rabban Gamaliel disagrees with the previous clause.  The non-Jew brings him a fish as a gift and we don’t know whether he caught the fish the day before or today.  Rabban Gamaliel states that the fish is permitted because he holds that doubtful muktzeh is permitted.  However, he adds that he himself acts more stringently and therefore he refuses to accept the fish.  Note that we also saw in the previous chapter that Rabban Gamaliel acted strictly with regard to himself.
