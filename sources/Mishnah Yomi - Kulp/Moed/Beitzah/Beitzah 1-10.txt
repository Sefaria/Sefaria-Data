Betzah, Chapter One, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
The final mishnah of chapter one discusses sending clothing as a gift on Yom Tov.

Mishnah Ten
One may send clothes, whether they are sewn up or not sewn up, and even though there is kil'ayim (mixed wool and linen) in them, provided they are necessary for the festival. 
But [one may] not [send] nailed sandals nor unfinished shoes. 
Rabbi Judah says: not even white shoes because they [still] require an artisan [to blacken them]. 
This is the general rule: whatever may be used on Yom Tov may [also] be sent [on Yom Tov].	

Explanation
Section one: On Yom Tov one may send even unfinished clothing which hasn’t been fully sewn because it can be used as a covering, such as a blanket.  One can even send clothing that is forbidden to wear because it has a mixture of wool and linen (kilayim, also called shatnez).  Although it is forbidden to wear such clothing, it is permitted to hang it up as a decoration and in certain cases to lie on top of it.  In other words, as long as there is some potential use to the clothing, he may use it on Yom Tov.
Section two:  Sandals that have nails in them were not worn on Yom Tov.  These seem to have been some sort of work shoe and since one doesn’t work on Yom Tov, one can’t wear them. Since they cannot be worn, they cannot be sent to friends either.
Section three:  Rabbi Judah says even shoes that are only missing the “finishing touches”, such as white shoes that need to be blackened, cannot be sent on Yom Tov because they are not generally worn.
Section four:  This is the general rule that summarizes the entire mishnah. If the object could be used as is on Yom Tov, then it can’t be sent.  But if it is missing some step in its preparation then it may not be sent because it is not generally used.
