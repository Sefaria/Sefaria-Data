Betzah, Chapter Three, Mishnah One

Introduction
This mishnah deals with catching fish, fowl or game on Yom Tov.  While slaughtering an animal is permitted on Yom Tov because it is done in the preparation of food, catching is not permitted because it could have been done the day before.  Our mishnah defines what is considered “catching.”  As an aside, the word in Hebrew for “catching” or “trapping” animals, fish or fowl is the same word as for hunting.  However, I have translated the word as “catching” because hunting, that is killing the animal while catching it, is not allowed. 

Mishnah One
One may not catch fish from a fishpond on Yom Tov nor give them food, 
But one may catch game or fowl from animal enclosures and one may put food before them. 
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: not all enclosures are alike. This is the general rule: anything that still needs to be trapped is forbidden but anything that need not be trapped is permitted. 

Explanation
Section one:  While fish in a pond are already to a certain extent trapped in a small enclosure, they still must be caught in order to eat them.  Since catching a fish from a fish pond is still considered catching it is therefore forbidden on Yom Tov.  It is forbidden to feed these fish lest by doing so he come to catch one of them.
Section two:  However, an animal which is trapped in a small enclosure is considered to already have been caught and hence one may “catch” such an animal or fowl on Yom Tov. Since it is permitted to catch them, he may also put food in front of them.
Section three: Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel points out that not all enclosures are alike. Fish in a bucket are basically already caught, whereas a deer in a very large pen is not caught. The general rule is that anything that still needs to be caught may not be caught on Yom Tov.
