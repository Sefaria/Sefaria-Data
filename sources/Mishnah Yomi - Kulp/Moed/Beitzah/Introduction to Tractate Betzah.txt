Introduction to Tractate Betzah

Tractate Betzah (Egg) teaches the laws governing Yom Tov (the festival), which means the first and last days of Pesah, the first day of Sukkot, Shmini Atzeret and Shavuot.  It is usually called “Betzah” after the first word of the first mishnah, although it was alternatively called Tractate Yom Tov.  

The Torah does not provide much information about the special laws of Yom Tov, those which would distinguish it from Shabbat.  They are mostly contained in Exodus 12:16, “And on the first day you shall celebrate a sacred occasion and on the last day, a sacred occasion; no work at all shall be done on them; only what every person is to eat, that alone may be prepared by you.”  In other words, Yom Tov is like Shabbat in that work is prohibited, with one major exception—one can prepare food.  Although this verse relates specifically to Pesah, it was interpreted as referring to all of the festival days. 

Not all food preparations were permitted on Yom Tov.  The general explanation is that all preparatory work that could have been done before Yom Tov without any loss to the quality of the food must be done before Yom Tov.  For instance, one cannot harvest wheat on Yom Tov, but one can knead and bake dough.  One cannot trap an animal on Yom Tov but one can slaughter, skin, salt and cut up the meat.  Lighting a fire is permitted, as is carrying from domain to domain because these actions are typically involved in preparing food. 

One of the reasons that one was allowed to prepare food on Yom Tov was that Yom Tov was supposed to be a big celebration.  The festival was supposed to be sanctified by eating and drinking and without being able to prepare fresh food (remember they had no refrigeration), the celebration would be lessened.

Good luck in learning Betzah!
