Betzah, Chapter One, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah deals with how one separates out the dirt and inedible parts from a pile of beans on Yom Tov.  “Sorting” is one of the prohibited labors on Shabbat, but it is permitted on Yom Tov because it is done in preparation of food.  

Mishnah Eight
One who sorts beans on Yom Tov: 
Bet Shammai says: he must sort the edible parts and eat [them immediate].
But Bet Hillel says: he may sort as usual in his lap or in a basket or in a dish; but not with a board or in a sifter or in a sieve. 
Rabban Gamaliel says: he may even rinse them [in water] and skim off [the refuse].

Explanation
Section one:  According to Bet Shammai he is not really allowed to sort out the beans and make two piles, one of edible beans and one of dirt and other such yucky stuff.  Rather all that he is allowed to do is sort out the beans and either eat them immediately, or put them in water to cook them if they are the type of bean that requires cooking.  Again we see that Bet Shammai allows one to prepare food on Yom Tov but requires it to be done in a very minimal way, and with some significant differences from how it is done during the week.     
Section two: Bet Hillel allows one to sort beans but only if he does so in a more make-shift fashion, using his lap a basket or a dish.  He may not use the instruments that he regularly uses during the week, vessels such as a board, a sifter or a sieve.
Section three: Rabban Gamaliel is the most lenient of the opinions in the mishnah.  He allows one to sort beans even by rinsing the beans in water and skimming off the refuse that floats to the surface.
