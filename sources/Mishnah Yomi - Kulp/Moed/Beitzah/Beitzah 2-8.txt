Betzah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Mishnah twelve contains three cases where Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah was more lenient than the other Sages.  We should note that not all of these sections deal with the laws of Yom Tov.

Mishnah Eight   
Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah allows three things and the Sages forbid them: 
His cow used to go out with the strap which she had between her horns;   
One may curry cattle on a festival; 
And one may grind pepper in its own mill. 
Rabbi Judah says: one may not curry cattle on a festival, because it may cause a wound, but one may comb them. 
But the Sages say: one may not curry them, and one may not even comb them.

Explanation
Section one:  It is forbidden to carry things in the public domain on Shabbat.  This is true even for a person’s animal, since it is forbidden to make one’s animal perform work on the Sabbath.  Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah allowed his cow to go out with a strap between its horns, since this strap was only an adornment and therefore he did not consider it “work”.  In the same way a person can wear clothing in the public domain and that is not considered carrying.  However, the Sages forbid cows from carrying anything, since most cows do not do so.  Furthermore, if others were to see this they would think that it is permitted for an animal to work on the Sabbath.  (See also Shabbat 5:4).
Section two:  Currying is a type of combing done with a sharp metal comb.  Rabbi Eleazar permits a person to curry an animal on the festival, even though that might cause a wound.  Rabbi Eleazar permits this since even if he does cause a wound he did not intend to do so and unintentionally performed work is permitted on Shabbat and Yom Tov.
Section three:  Rabbi Elazar holds that grinding pepper is permitted on Yom Tov because it is done in preparation of food, even if the grinding is done in a large mill.  The sages however allow the grinding of pepper only in a small mill, one which will produce less ground pepper and that is easier.    
Section four:  Rabbi Judah states that currying is forbidden since it will cause a wound, but combing with a wooden comb is permitted since it will not cause a wound.  
Section five: The Sages rule even more strictly.  Even combing is forbidden, lest by permitting combing one might assume that currying is also permitted.
