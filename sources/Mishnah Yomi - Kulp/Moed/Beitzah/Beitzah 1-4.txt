Betzah, Chapter One, Mishnah Four

Introduction
In yesterday’s mishnah we learned that in order to slaughter and eat doves on Yom Tov one must designate them for use before Yom Tov begins.  Otherwise they are muktzeh.  Our mishnah discusses what happens if he designated doves before Yom Tov but then is not sure that the doves that he finds in the nest or dovecote are the same ones.  
 
Mishnah Four
If he designated black [doves] but found [on Yom Tov] white ones, white [doves] but found black ones, two but found three, they are [all] forbidden. 
[If he designated] three but found two, they are permitted. 
[If he designated doves] inside the nest and found them in front of the nest, they are forbidden.
But if none were there except these, they are permitted.

Explanation
Section one:  If the doves which he finds are a different color from those that he designated it is obvious that they are not the same doves that he designated the previous day.  If he designated two doves and there are now three there, one of the doves is certainly muktzeh.  The problem is that he doesn’t know which one because all three look alike (I wonder if doves think all humans look alike).  Hence they are all prohibited.
Section two:  If he designated three but finds only two we can assume that one flew off and that the other two are the same ones he designated.  Hence they are permitted.
Section three:  If the doves are found outside of the nest but he designated them in the nest, then they may not be the same doves.  If there is another nearby dovecote then he must be concerned about this possibility and he may not use those doves.  However, if there are no nearby dovecotes then he can assume that these doves just found their way out and he may use them.
