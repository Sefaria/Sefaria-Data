Betzah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Five

Introduction 
It is permitted to make a fire on Yom Tov in order that one can cook food.  Our mishnah discusses making a fire so that one can heat up water to wash one’s feet.  

Mishnah Five
Bet Shammai says: a man may not heat water for his feet unless it is also fit for drinking. 
But Bet Hillel permits it. 
A man may make a fire and warm himself at it.

Explanation
Section one:  Bet Shammai holds that labors that are permitted on Yom Tov because they are necessary for preparing food are permitted only if they are done in the preparation of food.  One may not heat water just to wash one’s body. The only leniency for which Bet Shammai allows is that if one heats up water that is fit for drinking, one can also use it for other purposes.  This is similar to cooking on Yom Tov for the day after.  If one can eat some of the food cooked on Yom Tov, one is allowed to cook, knowing that there will be leftovers.  
Section two:  Bet Hillel generally holds that labors permitted in order to prepare food are permitted even if they are done not to prepare food.  Hence, heating water is permitted whether one does so for drinking water or to wash one’s feet.
Section three:  The final clause in the mishnah seems to also go according to Bet Hillel.  It is not only permitted to heat water in order to wash one’s feet, one may even make a fire just to keep warm.  The reason we might have thought that Bet Hillel prohibits this is that in this case there is no water being heated, water which one could claim one might drink in time of great thirst.  This section lets us know that Bet Hillel allows one to make a fire on Yom Tov even if there is no chance that it will lead to food preparation.
