Betzah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Six

Introduction
In the middle of yesterday’s mishnah we learned that chips of wood can be used only as kindling. Today’s mishnah continues to discuss this subject.

Mishnah Six
Rabbi Eliezer says: a man may take a chip from that which is lying before him to pick his teeth with it, and he may collect [chips] from the court yard and make a fire, for everything in a court is prepared [for use on Yom Tov]. 
But the sages say: he may collect only from that which is before him and make a fire.

Explanation
Section one:  Rabbi Eliezer says that one may take a chip of wood that is lying inside his house and use it to pick his teeth clean (aren’t you glad we have toothbrushes).  From outside the house one may collect chips of wood and use them to build a fire because according to Rabbi Eliezer all chips of wood are “prepared” to be used as wood for a fire—that is they are not muktzeh.  
Section two:  The sages disagree with Rabbi Eliezer on two accounts. First of all, one cannot gather wood from outside the house because it was not designated for use on Yom Tov.  Only the wood from inside the house that has been set aside for use can be used.  Secondly, they hold that wood can only be used to build a fire.  It cannot be used to pick one’s teeth (sorry if you’re a dentist).
