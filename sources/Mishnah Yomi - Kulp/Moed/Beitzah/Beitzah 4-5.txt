Betzah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah deals with certain preparations made in order to facilitate cooking.

Mishnah Five
One may not break up a potsherd or cut paper in order to roast on it a salty fish.
And one may not rake out an oven or a range, but one may press [the ashes] down.
And one may not place two jars side by side in order to balance upon them saucepan.   
And one may not prop up a pot with a wooden wedge and the same applies to a door.
And one may not drive cattle with a staff on a festival.
But Rabbi Elazar the son of Rabbi Shimon permits it.

Explanation
Section one:  When grilling a fish it would often be put on a broken shard of a pottery or on a piece of paper in order to prevent it from being burned.  The mishnah considers breaking some pottery or cutting a piece of paper to be used as such to be “making a vessel” which is not permitted on Yom Tov.
Section two: One should not rake out the ashes and dirt from an oven or a range. This is also considered to be “making a vessel” because it makes the oven usable.  However, it is permitted to “press down” the ashes, which seems to be a means of getting them out of the way in order to facilitate cooking.  The Rambam notes that if one cannot cook unless the ashes are raked out, he may do so because one is allowed to cook on Yom Tov. 
Section three: Putting two jars next to each other so that there is a fire in between them and then balancing a pan upon them is like building a makeshift range. This is prohibited because it is forbidden to build on Yom Tov.
Section four:  One may not use small pieces of wood to prop things up on Yom Tov because the wood was intended to be used as kindling.  All other uses are prohibited.
Section five:  According to the Talmud, one may not drive cattle with a stick because it looks like he is bringing them to the marketplace to sell.  Rabbi Elazar disagrees.
