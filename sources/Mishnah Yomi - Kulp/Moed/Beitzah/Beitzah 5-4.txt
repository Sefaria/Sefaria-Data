Betzah, Chapter Five, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with the Shabbat/Yom Tov border limits placed on things. Since the mishnah deals with carrying, the rules are only applicable to Yom Tov—on Shabbat all carrying is prohibited.  
 
Mishnah Four
One who borrows a vessel from his neighbor on the eve of Yom Tov, [it is restricted to the same limits] as the feet of the borrower. 
[But if he borrowed it] on Yom Tov, it is as the feet of the lender. 
A woman who borrowed from her neighbor spices, water or salt for her dough, these are [restricted to the same limits] as the feet of both them.   
Rabbi Judah exempts in the case of water, because it is not substantial.  

Explanation
Section one:  If one borrows an object it is considered as if the object belongs to the borrower and therefore it can go on Yom Tov to any place where he/she may go. However, this is only true if he borrowed it the day before Yom Tov, such that when Yom Tov began the object was in his possession.  In other words, the border limits of the object are determined by the one who possessed the object when Yom Tov began.  If he borrowed it on Yom Tov then it can go only where the feet of the lender can go.  
Section two:  In this case a woman borrows some ingredients from another woman to use them in making dough on Yom Tov. Some of the ingredients therefore belong to the lender and some belong to the borrower.  Since the ownership is mixed (like the dough) the dough can only go to a place where they both can go.  This again means that if one set an eruv to the south and one to the north, the dough cannot leave the city at all.
Rabbi Judah says that if all she borrowed was water then the dough is not restricted by the lender since the water is not substantial enough.  Water is not recognized in the final product or its taste and therefore it doesn’t count towards where the dough can go.
