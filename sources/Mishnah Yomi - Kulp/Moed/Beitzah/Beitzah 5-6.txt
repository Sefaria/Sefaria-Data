Betzah, Chapter Five, Mishnah Six

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with a person whose produce is in another town and he wishes to retrieve it on Yom Tov.

Mishnah Six
If one has his produce in another town, and the inhabitants of that city made an eruv in order to bring to him some of his produce, they may not bring it to him.
But if he himself made an eruv, his produce is like himself. 

Explanation
Section one:  In the case under discussion here the inhabitants of the other city made an eruv that would allow them to get to the city of the owner of the produce.  Nevertheless, they may not bring him his produce because his produce is limited by where he can go and since he didn’t set up an eruv to get to the other city, it can’t come to him.  Again, a person’s things are limited to going where he may go.
Section two:  If the owner of the produce set up an eruv then he can go to the other city and bring his produce back with him.  It is irrelevant whether the people of the other city set up an eruv since they are not the owners of the produce.
