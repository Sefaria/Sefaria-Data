Betzah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with the laws of slaughtering and divvying up meat on Yom Tov.

Mishnah Seven
One may not sharpen a knife on a festival, but one may draw it over another knife.
A man may not say to a butcher, “Weigh me a dinar’s worth of meat” but he may slaughter [the animal] and shares it among them. 

Explanation
Section one: He shouldn’t sharpen a knife with a sharpening stone on Yom Tov because this is similar to completing work on a vessel which is forbidden on Yom Tov.  Furthermore, he could have sharpened the knife before Yom Tov.  However, if he sharpens it in an unusual manner, by using another knife, then it is permitted.
Section two: This section returns to discussing the problem discussed in yesterday’s mishnah, the problem of buying meat on Yom Tov.  One cannot tell a butcher to give him a piece of meat worth a certain amount of money because this is considered conducting business as usual on Yom Tov, which is forbidden.  This is forbidden even if he weighs the meat out in a manner that is usually permitted, as we learned in yesterday’s mishnah.  Merely mentioning the price seems to be forbidden.  However, the butcher may slaughter the animal and divide it up among his clients keeping in mind how much each owes him.
