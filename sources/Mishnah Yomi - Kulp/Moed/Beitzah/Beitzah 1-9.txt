Betzah, Chapter One, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
In our mishnah the two houses debate what types of food gifts one person may send to his neighbor on Yom Tov.  The problem with gifts would occur if they cannot be used on Yom Tov itself.  

Mishnah Nine
Bet Shammai says: one may not send [gifts to a neighbor] on Yom Tov except portions [of food, ready to be eaten].
But Bet Hillel says: one may send cattle, game and poultry whether alive or slaughtered.
One may [also] send wine, oil, flour or pulse but not grain. 
And Rabbi Shimon permits [even] grain.

Explanation
Section one:  Bet Shammai says that one shouldn’t send gifts on Yom Tov unless they are ready to be eaten immediately.  Thus one could send pieces of meat or fish that have already been prepared.
Section two:  Bet Hillel extends this even more and allows one to send whole live animals to one’s friends, because he could slaughter the animals and eat them on Yom Tov.   Bet Hillel also permits one to send other food items to one’s friend on Yom Tov. The only exception is grain.  Since grain cannot be ground into flour on Yom Tov, because one can grind it the day before, one cannot send it as a gift on Yom Tov.
Section three:  Rabbi Shimon continues the trend to leniency by allowing one to send even grain.  Although one cannot grind the grain on Yom Tov, he is allowed to cook the grain whole and eat it as cereal.  In other words, even grain is edible on Yom Tov.
