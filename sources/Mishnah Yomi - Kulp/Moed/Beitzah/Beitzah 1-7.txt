Betzah, Chapter One, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah deals with grinding spices on Yom Tov.  Everyone agrees that they can be ground.  The debate is over whether they can be done in the normal way or they must be done differently somehow.

Mishnah Seven
Bet Shammai says: spices may be crushed with a wooden pestle and salt in a small cruse or with a wooden ladle.
But Bet Hillel says: spices may be crushed in the usual way with a stone pestle and salt with a wooden pestle.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Bet Shammai when one crushes spices on Yom Tov they have to be crushed differently.  Normally spices are crushed with a stone pestle—on Yom Tov they need to use a wooden pestle.  When crushing salt he shouldn’t use a pestle at all, rather he should use a small earthenware cruse and a wooden soup ladle.
Section two:  Bet Hillel holds that since it is permitted to crush spices and grind salt on Yom Tov, it is also permissible to crush them in a normal fashion—spices with a stone pestle and salt with a wooden pestle.
