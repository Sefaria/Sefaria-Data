Betzah, Chapter Five, Mishnah One

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with laws concerning fruit set out to dry and things that one may and may not do with this fruit on Yom Tov.

Mishnah One
One may let down fruit through a trap-door on Yom Tov but not on Shabbat. 
And one may cover up fruit with vessels on account of the rain, and likewise jars of wine and jars of oil.
And one may place a vessel beneath the drops of rain [even] on Shabbat.

Explanation
Section one:  This section deals with a person who has put his fruit up onto his roof to dry out on Yom Tov and then he sees that it is going to rain.  The mishnah allows him to drop the fruit down through a trap-door in the roof because this is not considered to be a lot of work.  He would not be allowed to take them down through a window or through the door because this is a greater amount of work.  Furthermore, they only allowed this on Yom Tov—on Shabbat it was prohibited.
Section two:  One also may cover up fruit, jars of wine and jars of oil if rain is leaking down on them.  Covering up fruit or bringing it into the house so it doesn’t get wet are activities done not in order to eat the fruit on Yom Tov, but they are nevertheless permitted in order to prevent the financial loss.
Section three:  On Shabbat one can even put a vessel underneath drops of rain coming down from a leaky roof.
