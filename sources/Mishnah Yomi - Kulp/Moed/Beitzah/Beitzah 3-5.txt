Betzah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Five

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with what may be done with a beast (a cow, sheep, goat or bull) that has died on Yom Tov.

Mishnah Five
If a beast died [on Yom Tov] it may not be moved from its place. 
And it happened that they once asked Rabbi Tarfon concerning this and concerning hallah that had become defiled.  He went into the bet midrash and inquired, and they answered him: they may not be moved from their place.

Explanation
Section one: Since the beast died and was not slaughtered, it cannot be eaten.  Since it cannot be eaten there is nothing that one may do with it on Yom Tov.  Hence, it is muktzeh.  All that he can do is leave it in its place and then when Yom Tov is over he can cut it up, use its hide and feed dogs with its meat.
Section two:  The mishnah now relates that this halakhah was asked of Rabbi Tarfon and he didnâ€™t know the answer until he went and asked the question in the study house, the bet midrash.  He also was asked about hallah, the part of the dough that is given to the priest, that had become impure on Yom Tov.  Impure hallah, like an animal that died without being slaughtered, cannot be eaten and hence it is also muktzeh on Yom Tov.  The answer therefore to both questions was that both are muktzeh and that neither can be moved until Yom Tov is over.
