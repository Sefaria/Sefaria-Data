Betzah, Chapter One, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah deals with slaughtering animals on Yom Tov.  

Mishnah Two
He who slaughters a wild animal or a bird on a festival — Bet Shammai says: he may dig with a pronged tool and cover up [the blood], but Bet Hillel says: he may not slaughter unless he has had earth made ready.   
But they agree that if he did slaughter he should dig with a pronged tool and cover up [the blood, and] that the ashes of a stove count as being prepared for the holiday.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Leviticus 17:13, when one slaughters an undomesticated animal or any type of fowl the blood must be poured out of the animal and covered with earth.  One who slaughters an undomesticated animal or fowl on the festival has a problem.  Although it is permitted to slaughter, if he doesn’t have any prepared earth to cover the blood newly dug earth is “muktzeh” and cannot be used.  Nevertheless, Bet Shammai permits one to dig up new earth and cover the blood.  Bet Hillel says one cannot slaughter unless one has earth already prepared.  
Section two: However, they all agree that if he had already slaughtered the animal, even though Bet Hillel says he should not have done so without already prepared earth, he may still dig new earth to cover the blood.  This is because the principle of muktzeh is only rabbinically ordained and the obligation to cover the blood is Biblical.  When one has two competing commandments, one rabbinic and one Biblical, the latter takes precedence.  The two houses also agree that the ashes in the oven are considered prepared for the festival, in other words they are not muktzeh.  Since people used these ashes for various purposes, we can make the assumption that before the festival began he knew in his mind that he would use these ashes.
