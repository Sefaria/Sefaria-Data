Sukkah, Chapter One, Mishnah Eight

Introduction 
The first section of this mishnah is concerned with someone who uses metal objects as skhakh.  The second section deals with the strange case of one who carves out room in a haystack to make a sukkah.

Mishnah Eight
One who roofs his sukkah with iron spits or with bedposts, if the space between them equals them, it is valid. 
One who hollows out a haystack to make for himself a sukkah, it is not a valid sukkah.

Explanation
Section one: Neither iron spits nor bedposts can be used as skhakh because they are both made of metal.  However, they can be put on top of the sukkah as long as there is valid skhakh between the posts or spits and the valid skakhah is of great quantity than the metal.
Section two:  In this case a person does not make a sukkah but rather the sukkah is made by his hollowing out a hole in a haystack. This is not valid because instead of making a sukkah, the sukkah has been made on its own. In other words, one must make his sukkah by taking skhakh and putting it on top of a framework of walls.  The one who hollows out the haystack has made an absence of space, a negative act, but not the positive act of creating a sukkah.  Hence the sukkah is not valid.
