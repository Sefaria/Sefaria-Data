Sukkah, Chapter One, Mishnah Five

Introduction 
This  mishnah deals with material that fits all of the criteria brought up in yesterday’s mishnah—it comes from the ground, it is detached from the ground and it is not receptive to impurity—and yet still cannot be used as skhakh.

Mishnah Five
Bundles of straw, bundles of wood, and bundles of brushwood—they do not use them as skhakh.
But all of them, if he untied them, are valid. 
And they are all valid for the walls.

Explanation
Section one:  The Talmud Yerushalmi explains that these bundles cannot be used as skhakh because it might look as if he is putting them up there for storage or to dry them out and not to use them for shade. 
Section two:  However, if he unties them, it no longer looks like he put them up there to dry or to store them and therefore the sukkah is valid.  
Section three:  Everything that is invalid for the skhakh is valid for the walls. When it comes to the walls all we are concerned about is that there are walls—we are not at all concerned with the material of the walls.  We should note that the word “sukkah” itself means “to cover” and the word “skhakh” is from the same root as the word for “sukkah.”  A “sukkah” is defined by its skhakh but not by its walls.
