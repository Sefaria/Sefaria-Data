Sukkah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Fourteen

Introduction
This mishnah is a continuation of yesterdayâ€™s mishnah which discussed taking the lulav on the first day of the festival which falls on Shabbat.

Mishnah Fourteen
Rabbi Yose says: if the first day of the festival fell on Shabbat, and he forgot and carried out his lulav into the public domain, he is not liable, since he brought it out while under the influence [of a religious act].  

Explanation
According to Rabbi Yose, since a person is supposed to take the lulav on Shabbat if it is also the first day of the festival, he is not obligated if he mistakenly carries it out into the public domain.  In other words, since he was allowed to take it in the first place, he is excused for making the mistake of carrying it outside.  However, if he did this on another day of the festival, meaning if another day of the festival fell on Shabbat, he would be liable since he should not have taken it at all. If he carries it outside into the public domain intentionally he is always liable
