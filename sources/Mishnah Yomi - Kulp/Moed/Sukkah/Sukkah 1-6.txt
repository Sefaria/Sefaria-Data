Sukkah, Chapter One, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah continues to discuss things that meet the requirements for skhakh as listed in mishnayot 3-4 (comes from the ground, is detached from the ground and is not receptive to impurity) but are still not valid to use as skhakh.

Mishnah Six
They may make skhakh out of wooden planks, the words or Rabbi Judah. 
Rabbi Meir forbids. 
If one places on top of [the sukkah] a plank four handbreadths wide, it is valid provided that he does not sleep under it. 

Explanation
Section one:  Rabbi Judah holds that one can use wooden planks whereas Rabbi Meir holds that these cannot be used. In the Talmud they debate how wide these planks are—some say that they are four handbreaths wide and others say that they are only three handbreadths wide. All agree that planks thinner than three handbreadths can be used.  In any case, Rabbi Meir rejects the use of broad wooden planks because the sukkah will look too much like a house.  Rabbi Judah accepts them and seems to simply be unconcerned if the sukkah looks like a house.  We have seen that Rabbi Judah allows very strong and stable structures to be valid sukkot—above in mishnah one he allowed a sukkah that was over 20 cubits high.  We shall also see Rabbi Judah with a similar type of opinion in 2:2.
Section two:  This section goes according to Rabbi Meir who forbids using wooden planks.  Rabbi Meir admits that one wooden plank, even if it were wide, would not invalidate the entire sukkah, just the area that it actually covers.  Therefore, he shouldn’t sleep (or eat) underneath this plank, but he may utilize other areas of the sukkah.
