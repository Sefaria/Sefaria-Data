Sukkah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Three

Introduction
The only difference between this mishnah and the previous mishnah concerning the lulav is that the lulav is taken on Shabbat if Shabbat is the first day of the festival, whereas the aravah (the willow) is taken on Shabbat if Shabbat falls on the seventh day of the festival.  If Shabbat falls on one of the other days, the aravah ritual is not performed on that day and it will turn out that the aravah ritual happens on only six days.  In mishnah five we will learn more about the aravah ritual as it was performed in the Temple.  The reason that only the seventh day supersedes Shabbat is that the seventh day is the climax of the ritual.
 
Mishnah Three
“The aravah—seven days.” How is this? 
If the seventh day of [the ritual of] the aravah fell on Shabbat, [it lasts] seven days; if it fell on any other day, [it lasts only] six.
