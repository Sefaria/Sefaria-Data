Sukkah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Two

Introduction
As we have learned before, outside of Jerusalem it is a mitzvah from the Torah to take the lulav only on the first day of the festival.  Hence, if the first day of the festival falls on Shabbat, one still performs the mitzvah of the lulav. We saw this described above in 3:13.  In such a case the lulav will be taken for seven days—one day in which the mitzvah is “deoraita”—from the Torah, and the rest of the days it is “derabbanan”—from the rabbis.
However, if Shabbat falls on another day besides the first day of the festival, then since the mitzvah is only of rabbinic origin, it is not observed. In other words, the derabanan mitzvah of the lulav does not override the Shabbat.   In such a case the mitzvah is observed for only six days.
Since the time of the Babylonian Talmud it has become customary not to take the lulav on Shabbat, even if it falls on the first day of the festival.  However, this is not the custom reflected in the mishnah.  
  
Mishnah Two
“The lulav for seven.” How so? 
If the first day of the festival fell on Shabbat, the lulav [is taken for] seven days; on any other day, [it is taken] for six.
