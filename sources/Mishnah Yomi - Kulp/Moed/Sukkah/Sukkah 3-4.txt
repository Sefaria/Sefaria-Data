Sukkah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Four

Introduction
In this mishnah the sages debate how many of each of the species he must take.

Mishnah Four 
Rabbi Ishmael says: three hadasim, two aravot, one lulav and one etrog, even if two [of the hadasim] have their tips broken off and [only] one is whole.
Rabbi Tarfon says:  even if all three have their tips broken off. 
Rabbi Akiva says: just as there is one lulav and one etrog, so too only one hadas and one aravah.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Rabbi Ishmael, one takes three hadas branches, two branches of aravot, one lulav and one etrog.  He probably derives these numbers midrashically from the verses.  However, the hadasim need not all be perfect.  Two of them may have their tips broken off, as long as the third one does not.  The Talmud questions this addendum to Rabbi Ishmael, wondering if a hadas with its tip cut off is valid.  If it is, then why must the third one have its tip intact, and if it is not, then why bring two invalid hadasim?
Section two:  Rabbi Tarfon agrees with Rabbi Ishmael regarding the numbers of each species that must be brought, but he disagrees concerning the tips of the hadasim.  He holds that a lulav with its tip broken off is valid.
Section three:  Rabbi Akiva disagrees with Rabbi Ishmael concerning the number of each species.  According to Rabbi Akiva one must only bring one of each species. 
The accepted halakhah with regard to the number of each species is according to Rabbi Ishmael.
