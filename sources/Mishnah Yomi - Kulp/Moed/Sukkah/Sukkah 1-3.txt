Sukkah, Chapter One, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah teaches that if there is a roof-like structure underneath or above the sukkah it invalidates the skhakh.

Mishnah Three
If he spread a sheet over it because of the sun or beneath it because of falling [leaves];
Or if he spread [a sheet] over the frame of a four-post bed, [the sukkah] is invalid.   
But he may spread it over the frame of a two-post bed. 

Explanation
Section one:  If he spread a sheet on top of the sukkah to keep out the sun, or a sheet underneath the skhakh to keep out the falling leaves, the sheet invalidates the sukkah.  This is because a sheet cannot be used for skhakh, so in essence he is using invalid skhakh to form his sukkah.
Section two:  Similarly, if he spreads a sheet over a four-post bed, the sheet invalidates his skhakh, because the sheet forms a roof.  However, the sheet does not invalidate the skhakh if it was spread over a two-post bed.  This is because the sheet forms a tent-like structure, one that slopes to the sides and is not considered a roof.  Since there is no roof made of a sheet, the only roof is the skhakh and the sukkah is valid.
