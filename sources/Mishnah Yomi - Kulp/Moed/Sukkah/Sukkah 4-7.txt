Sukkah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
Immediately after beating the willows (or palm branches) the children undo their lulavs and eat their etrogim.

Explanation
Once the ritual of the aravah was completed, children would immediately undo the ties binding their lulavim together and would immediately eat the etrogim.  This seems to encompass two concrete ways of demonstrating that the mitzvah was utterly completed.  Once the lulav is untied it is no longer really a lulavâ€”it is now just a palm branch, a willow and a myrtle branch.  Once the etrog has a bite taken out of it, it can no longer be used on Sukkot.
