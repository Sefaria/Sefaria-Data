The bier is not set down in the broadway [during the festival week] so as not to encourage the [funerary] lament; and the bier of women is never [set down in the broad way] for the sake of propriety.
Mishnah. Women may raise a wail during the festival [week], but not clap [their hands in grief]; r. Ishmael says, those that are close to the bier clap [their hands in grief]. On the days of new moon, of hanukkah and of purim  they may raise a wail and clap [their hands in grief]. Neither on the former  nor on the latter occasions do they chant a dirge. After [the dead] has been interred they neither raise a wail nor cap [their hands in grief]. What is meant by raising a wail’ [‘innuy]?  When all sing in unison. What is meant by a dirge [kinah]?  When one speaks  and all respond after her, as it is said: and teach your daughters wailing and one another [each] lamentation [kinah].  But as to the future [days] to come, [the prophet] says: he will destroy death for ever and the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces.
