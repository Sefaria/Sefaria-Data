Yoma, Chapter Two, Mishnah Six

Introduction 
This mishnah teaches how many priests were necessary to offer a ram, meaning a sheep that is two years old.  There are more needed than there are for the tamid which is a sheep in its first year, and therefore lighter.

Mishnah Six
A ram was offered by eleven: the flesh by five, the innards, the fine flour, and the wine by two each.

Explanation
The flesh is offered by five just like the tamid, which is a young sheep (see above mishnah three). However, the innards which were heavier required two priests to carry them up the ramp and then to the altar.  There was more flour and wine (see Numbers 15:4-7), therefore two priests carried the flour and two the wine instead of one each, as is the case for the tamid.
