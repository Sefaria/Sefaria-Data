Yoma, Chapter Six, Mishnah Seven

Introduction 
In this mishnah the high priest returns to the bull and the goat that have already been slaughtered and offers up their sacrificial parts on the altar.  

Mishnah Seven
He [the high priest] came to the bull and the goat that were to be burnt.
He cut them open and took out the sacrificial portions and put them on a tray, and them burned them on the altar. 
He twisted them around carrying poles and took them out to the place of burning. 
And from when are his clothes unclean?  
After they have gone outside the walls of the Temple courtyard. 
Rabbi Shimon says: from the moment the fire has taken hold of most of them.

Explanation
Section one:  The priest now finishes the sacrificing of the bull and goat.  He cuts them open, takes out the fats that must offered on the altar, and then he takes the rest of the carcasses out to the “place of burning” where they are completely burnt.
Section two:  Leviticus 16:28 states that he who burned the remnants of the sacrifices must wash his clothes and body because they are impure.  As did yesterday’s mishnah, our mishnah again asks when they become impure.  Again, the first opinion is that once the carcasses have been taken out of the walls (this time the Temple walls), the clothes of the person who is taking them have become impure.  Rabbi Shimon again gives a later time—from the time the fire on the altar has taken hold of most of the carcass.
