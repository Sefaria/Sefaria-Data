Yoma, Chapter Six, Mishnah Two

Introduction 
In this mishnah the high priest comes to the scapegoat and makes another confession.  This confession, which is referred to in Leviticus 16:21, is for the sins of the entire people of Israel.  

Mishnah Two
He then came to the scapegoat and laid his two hands upon it and he made confession. And thus he would say: “Please, ‘Hashem’! They have done wrong, they have transgressed, they have sinned before You, Your people the House of Israel.  Please, in the name of Hashem (Bashem)!  Forgive the wrongdoings, the transgressions, the sins which your people, the House of Israel, have committed and transgressed and sinned before You, as it is written in the torah of Moses Your servant: “For on this day shall atonement be made for you [to cleanse you of all your sins; you shall be clean before the Lord”] (Leviticus 16:30). 
And the priests and the people standing in the courtyard, when they would hear God’s name explicated coming out of the high priest’s mouth, would bend their knees, bow down and fall on their faces and say “Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever!”

Explanation
Section one:  The high priest comes to the goat, lays his hands on it and then makes a similar confession to that which he has already made over the goat “For Hashem” and the bull.  There is however, one difference here.  In the second recitation of “Please…” instead of saying “Please Hashem” and reciting the four letter name of God, he says, “Please in the name of Hashem” using the preposition “in” before God’s name.
Section two:  The response to this confession is described more vividly than in the previous two confessions.  However, all commentators say that this same response is also to be done for the other confessions as well.  Indeed, in the Yom Kippur liturgy, this response is placed not only after the third (and final) confession, but after the first two as well.
