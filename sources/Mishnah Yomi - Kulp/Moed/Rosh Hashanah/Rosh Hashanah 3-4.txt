Rosh Hashanah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah deals with the shofar and trumpet blasts that are sounded on public fast days.  These were fast days that were declared when Israel experienced distress, mostly the distress of not having enough rain.  Tractate Taanit, the next tractate which we shall learn, is dedicated to this subject.  

Mishnah Four
On [public] fast days they used shofars of rams, curved, the mouths of which were covered with silver, and there were two trumpets in between them. 
A short blast was made with the shofars and a long one with the trumpets, because the mitzvah of the day is with trumpets.

Explanation
Section one:  The basic function of this mishnah is to distinguish the Rosh Hashanah ritual, described in yesterday’s mishnah, with the public fast day ritual described here.  This distinction was probably created and then emphasized in the Mishnah in order to preserve the integrity of both occasions.  On public fast days the shofar was made from a ram’s horn, which was curved and instead of its mouth being covered with gold, it was covered with silver.  On Rosh Hashanah the trumpets were on the outside, whereas on public fast days they were in between the shofars.  
Section two:  This section again offers a distinction between the Rosh Hashanah practice and the public fast practice.  On Rosh Hashanah the mitzvah is with the shofar so its blasts are longer.  On the public fast day the mitzvah is with the trumpets, so their blasts are longer.  This is derived from Numbers 10:9 according to which the Israelites should blast trumpets when going out to war. From here the rabbis derive that in all cases of public distress, they should sound blasts with trumpets.
