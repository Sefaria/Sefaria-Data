Rosh Hashanah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah continues to discuss the torches used to let the Jews in the Diaspora know that the new month had been declared in Jerusalem.  The mishnah traces a progression from the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem all the way to Babylonia. At Bet Biltin the chain of torches would end for there the one waving the torch in Bet Biltin would be able to see all of the Diaspora lighting their torches in response. The Talmud relates that “Diaspora” here refers to Babylonia.  
Since the mishnah is self-explanatory, I will again refrain from commenting.

Mishnah Four 
At what places did they light the torches? 
From the Mount of Olives [in Jerusalem] to Sartaba, and from Sartaba to Gripina, and from Gripina to Havran, and from Havran to Bet Biltin.   
From Bet Biltin they did not move, but rather waved [the torch] back and forth and up and down until he saw the whole of the diaspora before him lit up like one bonfire.
