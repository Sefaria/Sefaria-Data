Rosh Hashanah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Seven

Introduction 
On days upon which Mussaf is recited (festivals and Rosh Hodesh) there are two people who function as the “shaliah tzibbur”, prayer leader—the first does Shacharit and the second does Mussaf.  Our mishnah determines which of these people blows the shofar and which of them recites the Hallel.

Mishnah Seven
The one who passes before the ark on the festival of Rosh Hashanah: the second one blows the shofar. 
On days when Hallel is said, the first one recites the Hallel.  

Explanation
Section one: On Rosh Hashanah, the shaliah tzibbur for Mussaf is the one who blows the shofar.  It is interesting that the mishnah needs to dictate this.  It seems that at some early point in the development of Jewish liturgy, the Shacharit Amidah for Rosh Hashanah also included liturgy in which it would have been appropriate to blow the shofar.  In our current liturgy, there is no place in the Shacharit Amidah to do so, and hence it is quite obvious that the shaliah tzibbur for Mussaf blows the shofar.
Section two:  On days on which Hallel is recited, the Shaliah Tzibbur for Shacharit is the one that recites the Hallel.  Today we practice this by having Hallel fall in between Shacharit and Mussaf.
