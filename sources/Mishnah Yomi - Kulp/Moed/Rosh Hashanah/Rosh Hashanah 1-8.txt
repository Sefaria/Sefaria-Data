Rosh Hashanah, Chapter One, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah is basically taken word for word from Sanhedrin 3:3.  It is brought here again because the previous mishnah mentioned the possibility that a person would be disqualified from testifying.

Mishnah Eight
And these are they which are not qualified [to be witnesses or judges]:
A dice player, a usurer, pigeon racers, or traffickers in Seventh Year produce, and slaves.
This is the general rule:  any testimony for which a woman is not qualified, they too are not qualified.

Explanation
Section one: There are five categories of people who are disqualified from acting as witnesses or judges:  1) The first is a dice player, in other words a gambler.  Such a person cannot testify since he is known to be a liar, especially with regards to monetary matters.  Another reason is that he doesn’t participate constructively in building society. 
2)  A usurer.  He is also probably considered to not be trustworthy in monetary matters.  
3)  A pigeon racer.  Racing pigeons was a form of gambling.  
4)  Those who sell produce grown during the Seventh Year. According to Lev. 25:5-7 produce grown in the fields during the Seventh Year may be eaten by its owners, but it may not be sold.  One who therefore sells Seventh Year produce is engaging in forbidden business practices which according to our mishnah make him not trustworthy to testify or act as a judge. 
5)  A slave—referring to a slave who has not been freed.
Section two: The rules of acceptance of testimony from slaves are the same as those for a woman.  Any case where they did allow the testimony of a woman, such as testimony concerning the death of another woman’s husband (see Mishnah Yevamot 15:4), they also allowed the testimony of a slave
