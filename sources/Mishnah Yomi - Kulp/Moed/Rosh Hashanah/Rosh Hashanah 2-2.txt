Rosh Hashanah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Introduction 
Above in 1:3 we learned that the court used to send messengers out to let the people in the Diaspora know that the new month had been decreed.  In our mishnah we learn that this custom was the result of another attempt by a non-Pharisaic/rabbinic group of Jews to disrupt the calendar.  

Mishnah Two
Originally they used to light torches [to signal that the new month had been decreed].   
When the Samaritans disrupted this, they decreed that messengers should go out.

Explanation
In tomorrowâ€™s mishnah we shall learn how they used to light torches, or beacons, in order to let everyone in the Diaspora know that a new month had been decreed.  Here we learn that they stopped doing this because the Samaritans disrupted the process by lighting torches on the night of the thirtieth even though the court had not decreed a new month.  Again we see that one of the sects attempts to have other Jews, Jews who follow a rabbinic calendar, celebrate their holidays on the wrong day.
