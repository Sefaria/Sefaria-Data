Rosh Hashanah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Nine

Introduction 

Mishnah Nine
The order of the blasts:  three sets of three each.  
The length of a tekiâ€™ah is equal to three teru'ahs, and the length of a teru'ah is equal to three yevavot.   
If one prolonged the first teki'ah so that it went directly int the second, it counts only as one.   
One who has blessed [recited the Amidah] and then a shofar is given to him, he sounds a teki'ah teru'ah teki'ah three times.   
Just as the congregational reader is obligated, so every single individual is obligated.   
Rabban Gamaliel says:  the shaliah tzibbur (communal prayer leader) causes the whole congregation to fulfill their obligation.
