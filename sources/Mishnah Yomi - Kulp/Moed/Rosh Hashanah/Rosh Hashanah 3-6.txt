Rosh Hashanah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Six

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with the physical wholeness of the shofar.  It teaches what flaws in the shofar render it invalid.

Mishnah Six
A shofar which has split and then he stuck it together is not valid.   
If he stuck together fragments of shofars, it is not valid.
If there was a hole in a shofar and he closed it up, if it interferes with the blowing it is not valid, but if it does not it is valid.

Explanation
Section one: According to the Talmud, this refers to a shofar which has split lengthwise.  One cannot use it by gluing it back together.  This is either because the shofar won’t sound good, or because air will inevitably escape not only from the end but from the sides as well.
Section two:  In this case, someone tries to glue together pieces of a broken shofar to make one whole one. This doesn’t work for the same reasons it doesn’t work to glue together one shofar.  
Section three: In this case the shofar was not cracked, as was the shofar in yesterday’s mishnah, but just had a hole in it.  If after he patches it up the shofar sounds okay, then it may be used.  If not, it may not be used.  Others explain that the words “if it interferes with the blowing” refer to before the hole is closed.  If the hole prevents the sound before it is patched up, he may not use the shofar even after it has been patched up.
