<p>&#x201C;Peel.&#x201D; This is a possible allusion to a favorite theme in Jewish Mysticism. &#x201C;Evil is the <italic>Kelipah</italic>, the &#x2018;bark&#x2019; of the cosmic tree or &#x2018;The shell of the nut&#x2019; &#x201D;.

<p>&#x201C;Just as a piece of fruit has a peel.&#x201D; This metaphor seems to be Kabbalistic, especially the use of &#x201C;peel&#x201D; for &#x201C;evil.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;and there is the part in between.&#x201D; This refers to some kind of intermediary state between excellence and worthlessness.</p>

<p>This paragraph sounds Kabbalistic, not only in the imagery but also in the idea that evil is a necessary part in the creation of the world. Theodore Friedman in his review of Ephraim E. Urbach&#x2019;s <italic>The Sages&#x2014;Their Concepts and Beliefs</italic> (Hebrew) Jerusalem, Magnes: 1969, in <italic>Judaism</italic> Vol. 21:4, p. 499 deals with the famous controversy between the Schools of Shammai and Hillel, whether or not it would have been better for man never to have been born (Eruvin 13b). Urbach said that the question that exercised the two Schools was whether or not it would have been better for [the wicked] never to have been born. Friedman feels &#x201C;unconvinced&#x201D; that such is the plain meaning of the text. It is interesting to observe that the text which Urbach uses (p. 226) taken from the <italic>Ethics of the Fathers</italic> VI: 11 &#x201C;Whatsoever the Holy One, blessed be He, created in His world, He created it only for His glory&#x201D;, as it is written, <italic>Everything that is called by my name and that I have created, I have formed it, yea, I have made it</italic> (Isaiah 43:7) contains the very same verse which was cited by our author in the beginning of this chapter. See p. 10, lines 21-22.</p>
<p><italic>Page 12. Lines 25-26.</italic></p>
<p>Our author seems to presuppose here Maimonides&#x2019; rejection of the Aristotelian theory that the heavenly motions are without beginning. (Guide 2, Introduction, Proposition 26). On the 26th Proposition or &#x201C;Premise&#x201D; see Moses Maimonides, <italic>The Guide to the Perplexed</italic> translated by Shlomo Pines, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963), pp. 240-241.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Even though the Divine name does not lack anything.&#x201D; See Psalms 10:16, &#x201C;The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nations are perished out of His land.&#x201D; M. L. Malbim in his commentary on the Psalms <italic>Kitbe Kodesh Psalms</italic>, (Vilna: Romm. 1911), p. 21 observed &#x201C;although the nations are absent from His land, God is God with or without people.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Heavenly bodies and spheres.&#x201D; According to Maimonides, the spheres have music. Sir Thomas Brown (1605-1682) said &#x201C;We maintain the music of the spheres.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Furthermore, we see that the work of the tabernacle,&#x201D; Dr. Seymour Siegel called my attention to the fact that the tabernacle is like man or indeed a picture of the whole world. My teacher, Professor Louis Ginzberg, <italic>The Legends of the Jews</italic>, (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1911) Vol. 3, p. 165 observed that &#x201C;the separate parts of the tabernacle had each a symbolic significance, for to all that is above there is something corresponding below.&#x201D; In the explanatory footnote Vol. 6, p. 67, footnote 346, he observes that &#x201C;The most elaborate symbolic explanation of the tabernacle, found in rabbinic sources, is the one given by R. Shemaiah of Soisson in his treatise on the tabernacle published by Berliner in <italic>Montasschrift</italic> XIII, 225-231 and 258-264. A. Epstein, <italic>Mikkadmoniyyot</italic> (supplement), 2-4, calls attention to the close resemblance of the symbolic explanation, as given by R. Shemaiah, to that found in Tadshe and Bereshit Rabbati, all three attempting to show that man, the world, and the Sanctuary correspond to one another.&#x201D; Alexander Altmann in his <italic>Studies in Religious Philosophy and Mysticism</italic>, (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1969), p. 26 observes &#x201C;That the Sanctuary and its furniture mirror the cosmos is an old midrashic motif, particularly pronounced in <italic>Midrash Tadshe</italic> (133). The observation that creation began with the macrocosm and ended with the microcosm is already found in Philo (Opif. 82) and Abraham bar Hiyya <italic>(Hegyon Ha-Nefesh</italic>, 1b).&#x201D; Altmann observes that S. Z. Netter in his supercommentary on Ibn Ezra offers a wealth of detail concerning these analogies.</p>

<p>Altmann, <italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 18 in discussing the Delphic Maxim, &#x201C;Know Thyself&#x201D;, quotes from the <italic>Zohar Hadash</italic>, where there is a coupling together of knowing oneself and knowing one&#x2019;s Lord, and makes the following comment: &#x201C;The text continues: &#x201C;And to make himself aware who he is&#x201D;&#x2014;this is the question we met twice in Moses de Leon&#x2014;&#x201C;and how he was created; whence he comes and whither he goes&#x201D;&#x2014;quoting the well-known passage in <italic>Abot</italic> 3, 1 which reflects Gnostic influence, as S. Lieberman has shown (95) &#x201C;and how his body has been arranged (tiqquna de-gufa he&#x2019;akh ittaqen)&#x0021;&#x2014;This reflects a philosophical motif which will be more fully discussed below (pp. 23, 25, 27): from the arrangement of his body man can infer the wisdom of his Maker. The term &#x201C;tiqquna&#x201D; used in our passage has a precedent in, for example, Samuel ben Nissim Masnut&#x2019;s <italic>Ma&#x2019;yan Ganim</italic> (twelfth century), where the meaning of Job 19:26, &#x201C;From my flesh I behold God&#x201D;, is explained: &#x201C;From the formation of my limbs and from the arrangement of my body (we-taqqanat gufi)&#x2014;contemplating them&#x2014;I behold God&#x201D; (ed. Buber, 61).&#x201D; He also observes, <italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 24-25, &#x201C;Abraham bar Hiyya closely follows Bahya in interpreting Job 19:26 to mean that &#x201C;from the formation of your body (literally, &#x2018;flesh&#x2019;) and the arrangement of your limbs you can see and understand the wisdom of your Creator.&#x201D; This theme becomes a popular topic in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Samuel ben Nissim Masnut, who lived in twelfth-century Aleppo, quotes Job 19:26 as meaning to say that &#x201C;From the formation of my limbs and from the arrangement of my body&#x2014;contemplating them&#x2014;I behold God (that is, the wonders of the Creator) ; for by seeing the created, man knows the wonders of the Creator, in the way in which it is said, &#x2018;The heavens declare &#x2026;&#x2019; (Ps. 19:2), which the <italic>Targum</italic> renders, &#x2018;Those who contemplate the heaven tell the glory of the Lord.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;For the upper world is like a root.&#x201D; A Platonic notion that the idea comes first. In Midrashic thought, <italic>Torah</italic>, the idea comes first, then God&#x2019;s throne of glory, then Israel, then <italic>Olam Ha&#x2019;ba</italic>, the future eternity.</p>

<p>&#x201C;As an act of grace and kindness.&#x201D; The word <italic>&#x201C;Hesed&#x201D;</italic> has several meanings in Biblical Hebrew.

<p>&#x201C;The general soul.&#x201D; This sounds like the Platonic notion of the world soul. (Plato, <italic>Timaeus</italic> Paragraph 30, 34 b-d). On the other hand, it may refer to the soul that in certain neo-Aristotelian views, resides in each celestial body. It all depends upon the reference, cf. <italic>galgal</italic> sphere. Does it refer to the whole universe? If so, then the Platonic theory is implied. If it refers to individual heavenly bodies or their spheres, then the Aristotelian theory is implied. The first interpretation seems more plausible.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Since it has been explained that the soul is knowledge.&#x201D; David W. Silverman drew my attention to Harry Blumberg&#x2019;s &#x201C;Problems of Immortality&#x201D; <italic>Harry A. Wolfson Jubilee Volume</italic> (English) p. 168 ff, &#x201C;The destruction of the body will therefore not result in the destruction of the soul.

<p>The first word in the Hebrew, line 2, <italic>b&#x2019;hasagat</italic>, is most difficult. This phrase cannot be correct since the subsequent argument denies this principle. It is the fact that we don&#x2019;t comprehend some feature of God that proves that God possesses this feature. We should translate &#x201C;for the lack of our ability to grasp all these qualities is a sign that they are found in the Creator.&#x201D; The word <italic>b&#x2019;hasagat</italic> should be read as two words, <italic>b&#x2019;ee hasagat</italic>. All of the early editions have the same reading as our text. Constantinople (1520), Venice (1544, p. 49b), Cracow (1586, p. 20b), Frankfurt (1735, p. 26a).</p>
