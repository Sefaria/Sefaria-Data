Genesis 1:2,"the earth being unformed and void, with darkness over the surface of the deep and a wind from<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>a wind from </b>Others “the spirit of.”</i> God sweeping over the water—"
Genesis 1:3,"God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light."
Genesis 1:4,"God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness."
Genesis 1:5,"God called the light Day and called the darkness Night. And there was evening and there was morning, a first day.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>a first day </b>Others “one day.”</i> "
Genesis 1:6,"God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, that it may separate water from water.”"
Genesis 1:7,"God made the expanse, and it separated the water which was below the expanse from the water which was above the expanse. And it was so."
Genesis 1:8,"God called the expanse Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day."
Genesis 1:9,"God said, “Let the water below the sky be gathered into one area, that the dry land may appear.” And it was so."
Genesis 1:10,God called the dry land Earth and called the gathering of waters Seas. And God saw that this was good.
Genesis 1:11,"And God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation: seed-bearing plants, fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it.” And it was so."
Genesis 1:12,"The earth brought forth vegetation: seed-bearing plants of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that this was good."
Genesis 1:13,"And there was evening and there was morning, a third day."
Genesis 1:14,"God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate day from night; they shall serve as signs for the set times—the days and the years;"
Genesis 1:15,and they shall serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth.” And it was so.
Genesis 1:16,"God made the two great lights, the greater light to dominate the day and the lesser light to dominate the night, and the stars."
Genesis 1:17,"And God set them in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth,"
Genesis 1:18,"to dominate the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that this was good."
Genesis 1:19,"And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day."
Genesis 1:20,"God said, “Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and birds that fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.”"
Genesis 1:21,"God created the great sea monsters, and all the living creatures of every kind that creep, which the waters brought forth in swarms, and all the winged birds of every kind. And God saw that this was good."
Genesis 1:22,"God blessed them, saying, “Be fertile and increase, fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.”"
Genesis 1:23,"And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day."
Genesis 1:24,"God said, “Let the earth bring forth every kind of living creature: cattle, creeping things, and wild beasts of every kind.” And it was so."
Genesis 1:25,"God made wild beasts of every kind and cattle of every kind, and all kinds of creeping things of the earth. And God saw that this was good."
Genesis 1:26,"And God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, after our likeness. They shall rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the cattle, the whole earth, and all the creeping things that creep on earth.”<br>"
Genesis 1:27,"And God created humankind in the divine image,<br>creating it in the image of God—<br>creating them male and female."
Genesis 1:28,"God blessed them and God said to them, “Be fertile and increase, fill the earth and master it; and rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and all the living things that creep on earth.”"

Genesis 1:31,"And God saw all that had been made, and found it very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day."
Genesis 2:1,"The heaven and the earth were finished, and all their array."
Genesis 2:2,"On the seventh day God finished the work that had been undertaken: [God] ceased<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>ceased </b>Or “rested.”</i> on the seventh day from doing any of the work."
Genesis 2:3,And God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy—having ceased on it from all the work of creation that God had done.
Genesis 2:4,Such is the story of heaven and earth when they were created. When God יהוה made earth and heaven—
Genesis 2:5,"when no shrub of the field<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>shrub of the field </b>I.e., suitable for pasturage.</i> was yet on earth and no grasses of the field<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>grasses of the field </b>I.e., cereal grasses, suitable as crops.</i> had yet sprouted, because God יהוה had not sent rain upon the earth and there were no human beings to till the soil,"
Genesis 2:6,but a flow would well up from the ground and water the whole surface of the earth—
Genesis 2:7,"God יהוה formed the Human<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>the Human </b>I.e., the progenitor of the species and the point of origin for human society. Heb. ha-’adam; trad. “man.” In the eyes of ancient Israel, the typical initiator of a lineage was male, and so the first human being would also have been imagined as male. See further the Dictionary under ’adam.</i> from the soil’s humus,<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>soil’s humus </b>Heb. ‘afar min ha-’adamah, rendered to emulate the wordplay with Heb. ha-’adam “the Human”; more precisely, “loose dirt from the soil.” NJPS “dust of the earth.”</i> blowing into his nostrils the breath of life: the Human became a living being."
Genesis 2:8,"God יהוה planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and placed there the Human who had been fashioned."
Genesis 2:9,"And from the ground God יהוה caused to grow every tree that was pleasing to the sight and good for food, with the tree of life in the middle of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and bad."
Genesis 2:10,"A river issues from Eden to water the garden, and it then divides and becomes four branches."
Genesis 2:11,"The name of the first is Pishon, the one that winds through the whole land of Havilah, where the gold is."
Genesis 2:12,"(The gold of that land is good; bdellium is there, and lapis lazuli.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>lapis lazuli </b>Others “onyx”; meaning of Heb. shoham uncertain.</i> )"
Genesis 2:13,"The name of the second river is Gihon, the one that winds through the whole land of Cush."
Genesis 2:14,"The name of the third river is Tigris, the one that flows east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates."
Genesis 2:15,"God יהוה settled the Human in the garden of Eden, to till it and tend it."
Genesis 2:16,"And God יהוה commanded the Human, saying, “Of every tree of the garden you are free to eat;"
Genesis 2:17,"but as for the tree of knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat of it; for as soon as you eat of it, you shall die.”"
Genesis 2:18,"God יהוה said, “It is not good for the Human to be alone; I will make a fitting counterpart for him.”"
Genesis 2:19,"And God יהוה formed out of the earth all the wild beasts and all the birds of the sky, and brought them to the Human to see what he would call them; and whatever the Human called each living creature, that would be its name."
Genesis 2:20,And the Human gave names to all the cattle and to the birds of the sky and to all the wild beasts; but no fitting counterpart for a human being was found.
Genesis 2:21,"So God יהוה cast a deep sleep upon the Human; and, while he slept, [God] took one of his sides<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>sides </b>Heb. ṣela‘ot, trad. “ribs.” Cf. 1 Kings 6.34; Exod. 25.12; 26.20, 26–27, 35; 30.4.</i> and closed up the flesh at that site."
Genesis 2:22,"And God יהוה fashioned the side that had been taken from the Human into a woman, bringing her to the Human."
Genesis 2:23,"Then the Human said,<br>“This one at last<br>Is bone of my bones<br>And flesh of my flesh.<br>This one shall be called Woman,<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Woman </b>Heb. ’ishshah; so trad. More precisely in context, “a (female) member of the human species.” See next note and the Dictionary under ’ish.</i> <br>For from a Human<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>a Human </b>More precisely, “the (formerly lone) member of the human species.” NJPS “man”; trad. “Man.” See the Dictionary under ’ish.</i> was she taken.”"
Genesis 2:24,"Hence a man<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>man </b>So trad.; Heb. ’ish. Contrast the previous verse.</i> leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife,<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>wife </b>So trad.; Heb. ’ishshah (with possessive suffix). Cf. the previous note and contrast the previous verse.</i> so that they become one flesh."
Genesis 2:25,"The two of them were naked,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>naked </b>Heb. ‘arummim, play on ‘arum “shrewd” in 3.1.</i> the Human<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>the Human </b>Heb. ha-’adam; trad. “the man.” See note at v. 7.</i> and his wife, yet they felt no shame."
Genesis 3:1,"Now the serpent was the shrewdest of all the wild beasts that God יהוה had made. It said to the woman, “Did God really say: You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?”"
Genesis 3:2,"The woman replied to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the other trees of the garden."
Genesis 3:3,"It is only about fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God said: ‘You shall not eat of it or touch it, lest you die.’”"
Genesis 3:4,"And the serpent said to the woman, “You are not going to die,"
Genesis 3:5,"but God knows that as soon as you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like divine beings who know<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>divine beings who know </b>Others “God, who knows.”</i> good and bad.”"
Genesis 3:6,"When the woman saw that the tree was good for eating and a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable as a source of wisdom, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave some to her husband, and he ate."
Genesis 3:7,Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they perceived that they were naked; and they sewed together fig leaves and made themselves loincloths.
Genesis 3:8,They heard the sound of God יהוה moving about in the garden at the breezy time of day; and the Human and his wife hid from God יהוה among the trees of the garden.
Genesis 3:9,"God יהוה called out to the Human and said to him, “Where are you?”"
Genesis 3:10,"He replied, “I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.”"
Genesis 3:11,“Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat of the tree from which I had forbidden you to eat?”
Genesis 3:12,"The Human said, “The woman You put at my side—she gave me of the tree, and I ate.”"
Genesis 3:13,"And God יהוה said to the woman, “What is this you have done!” The woman replied, “The serpent duped me, and I ate.”"
Genesis 3:14,"Then God יהוה said to the serpent,<br>“Because you did this,<br>More cursed shall you be<br>Than all cattle<br>And all the wild beasts:<br>On your belly shall you crawl<br>And dirt shall you eat<br>All the days of your life.<br>"
Genesis 3:15,"I will put enmity<br>Between you and the woman,<br>And between your offspring and hers;<br>They shall strike at your head,<br>And you shall strike at their heel.”"
Genesis 3:16,"And to the woman [God] said,<br>“I will greatly expand<br>Your hard labor—and your pregnancies;<br>In hardship shall you bear children.<br>Yet your urge shall be for your husband,<br>And he shall rule over you.”<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>rule over you </b>(So NJPS.) I.e., for matters of sexual relations he will have the last word.</i> "
Genesis 3:17,"To Adam [God] said, “Because you did as your wife said and ate of the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You shall not eat of it,’<br>Cursed be the ground because of you;<br>By hard labor shall you eat of it<br>All the days of your life:<br>"
Genesis 3:18,Thorns and thistles shall it sprout for you.<br>But your food shall be the grasses of the field;<br>
Genesis 3:19,"By the sweat of your brow<br>Shall you get bread to eat,<br>Until you return to the ground—<br>For from it you were taken.<br>For dust<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>dust </b>Heb. ‘afar. Cf. the second note at 2.7.</i> you are,<br>And to dust you shall return.”"
Genesis 3:20,"The Human named his wife Eve,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Eve </b>Heb. ḥawwaḥ.</i> because she was the mother of all the living.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>living </b>Heb. ḥai.</i> "
Genesis 3:21,"And God יהוה made garments of skins for Adam and his wife, and clothed them."
Genesis 3:22,"And God יהוה said, “Now that humankind has become like any of us, knowing good and bad, what if one should stretch out a hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever!”"
Genesis 3:23,"So God יהוה banished humankind<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>humankind </b>Moved up from v. 24 for clarity.</i> from the garden of Eden, to till the humus<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>humus </b>Lit. “soil.” See the second note at 2.7.</i> from which it was taken:"
Genesis 3:24,"it was driven out; and east of the garden of Eden were stationed the cherubim and the fiery ever-turning sword, to guard the way to the tree of life."
Genesis 4:1,"Now the Human knew<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>knew </b>Heb. yada‘, often in a sexual sense.</i> his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, “I have gained<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>gained </b>Echoing the Heb. wordplay: qanithi, connected with “Cain”; lit. “created, acquired.”</i> a person<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>a person </b>Or “someone new.” Lit. “a participant whose involvement defines the depicted situation.” Unlike “man” in contemporary English, Heb. ’ish can include infants in its denotative scope, as here and in Isa. 66.13.

Genesis 4:2,"She then bore his brother Abel. Abel became a keeper of sheep, and Cain became a tiller of the soil."
Genesis 4:3,"In the course of time, Cain brought an offering to יהוה from the fruit of the soil;"
Genesis 4:4,"and Abel, for his part, brought the choicest of the firstlings of his flock. יהוה paid heed to Abel and his offering,"
Genesis 4:5,but to Cain and his offering [God] paid no heed. Cain was much distressed and his face fell.
Genesis 4:6,"And יהוה said to Cain,<br>“Why are you distressed,<br>And why is your face fallen?<br>"
Genesis 4:7,"<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">Meaning of verse uncertain.</i> Surely, if you do right,<br>There is uplift.<br>But if you do not do right<br>Sin couches at the door;<br>Its urge is toward you,<br>Yet you can be its master.”"
Genesis 4:8,"Cain said to his brother Abel …<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>… </b>Ancient versions, including the Targum, read “Come, let us go out into the field.”</i> and when they were in the field, Cain set upon his brother Abel and killed him."
Genesis 4:9," יהוה said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” And he said, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”"
Genesis 4:10,"“What have you done? Hark, your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground!"
Genesis 4:11,"Therefore, you shall be more cursed than the ground,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>more cursed than the ground </b>See 3.17.</i> which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand."
Genesis 4:12,"If you till the soil, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. You shall become a ceaseless wanderer on earth.”"
Genesis 4:13,"Cain said to יהוה, “My punishment is too great to bear!"
Genesis 4:14,"Since You have banished me this day from the soil, and I must avoid Your presence and become a restless wanderer on earth—anyone who meets me may kill me!”"
Genesis 4:15,"יהוה said to him, “I promise, if anyone kills Cain, sevenfold vengeance shall be exacted.” And יהוה put a mark on Cain, lest anyone who met him should kill him."
Genesis 4:16,"Cain left the presence of יהוה and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden."
Genesis 4:17,"Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he then founded a city, and named the city after his son Enoch."

Genesis 4:26,"And to Seth, in turn, a son was born, and he named him Enosh. It was then that יהוה began to be invoked by name."
Genesis 5:1,"This is the record of Adam’s line.—When God created humankind, it was made in the likeness of God;"

Genesis 7:13,"That same day Noah and Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, went into the ark, with Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons—"

Genesis 7:15,"They came to Noah into the ark, two each of all flesh in which there was breath of life."

Genesis 7:23,"All existence on earth was blotted out—humans, cattle, creeping things, and birds of the sky; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark."
Genesis 7:24,"And when the waters had swelled on the earth one hundred and fifty days,"
Genesis 8:1,"God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark, and God caused a wind to blow across the earth, and the waters subsided."
Genesis 8:2,"The fountains of the deep and the floodgates of the sky were stopped up, and the rain from the sky was held back;"
Genesis 8:3,"the waters then receded steadily from the earth. At the end of one hundred and fifty days the waters diminished,"
Genesis 8:4,"so that in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat."
Genesis 8:5,"The waters went on diminishing until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first of the month, the tops of the mountains became visible."
Genesis 8:6,"At the end of forty days, Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made"
Genesis 8:7,and sent out the raven; it went to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth.
Genesis 8:8,Then he sent out the dove to see whether the waters had decreased from the surface of the ground.
Genesis 8:9,"But the dove could not find a resting place for its foot, and returned to him to the ark, for there was water over all the earth. So putting out his hand, he took it into the ark with him."
Genesis 8:10,"He waited another seven days, and again sent out the dove from the ark."
Genesis 8:11,"The dove came back to him toward evening, and there in its bill was a plucked-off olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the waters had decreased on the earth."
Genesis 8:12,He waited still another seven days and sent the dove forth; and it did not return to him any more.
Genesis 8:13,"In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the waters began to dry from the earth; and when Noah removed the covering of the ark, he saw that the surface of the ground was drying."
Genesis 8:14,"And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry."
Genesis 8:15,"God spoke to Noah, saying,"
Genesis 8:16,"“Come out of the ark, together with your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives."
Genesis 8:17,"Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you: birds, animals, and everything that creeps on earth; and let them swarm on the earth and be fertile and increase on earth.”"
Genesis 8:18,"So Noah came out, together with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives."
Genesis 8:19,"Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that stirs on earth came out of the ark by families."
Genesis 8:20,"Then Noah built an altar to יהוה and, taking of every pure animal and of every pure bird, he offered burnt offerings on the altar."
Genesis 8:21,"יהוה smelled the pleasing odor, and יהוה resolved: “Never again will I doom the earth because of humankind, since the devisings of the human mind are evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living being, as I have done.<br>"
Genesis 8:22,"So long as the earth endures,<br>Seedtime and harvest,<br>Cold and heat,<br>Summer and winter,<br>Day and night<br>Shall not cease.”"
Genesis 9:1,"God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fertile and increase, and fill the earth."
Genesis 9:2,The fear and the dread of you shall be upon all the beasts of the earth and upon all the birds of the sky—everything with which the earth is astir—and upon all the fish of the sea; they are given into your hand.
Genesis 9:3,"Every creature that lives shall be yours to eat; as with the green grasses, I give you all these."
Genesis 9:4,"You must not, however, eat flesh with its life-blood in it."
Genesis 9:5,"But for your own life-blood I will require a reckoning: I will require it of every beast; of humankind, too, will I require a reckoning for human life, of everyone for each other!<br>"
Genesis 9:6,"Whoever sheds human blood,<br>By human [hands] shall that one’s blood be shed;<br>For in the image of God<br>Was humankind made."

Genesis 9:8,"And God said to Noah and to his sons with him,"
Genesis 9:9,"“I now establish My covenant with you and your offspring to come,"
Genesis 9:10,"and with every living thing that is with you—birds, cattle, and every wild beast as well—all that have come out of the ark, every living thing on earth."
Genesis 9:11,"I will maintain My covenant with you: never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.”"
Genesis 9:12,"God further said, “This is the sign that I set for the covenant between Me and you, and every living creature with you, for all ages to come."
Genesis 9:13,"I have set My bow in the clouds, and it shall serve as a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth."
Genesis 9:14,"When I bring clouds over the earth, and the bow appears in the clouds,"
Genesis 9:15,"I will remember My covenant between Me and you and every living creature among all flesh, so that the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh."
Genesis 9:16,"When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures, all flesh that is on earth."
Genesis 9:17,"That,” God said to Noah, “shall be the sign of the covenant that I have established between Me and all flesh that is on earth.”"
Genesis 9:18,"The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth—Ham being the father of Canaan."

Genesis 9:24,"When Noah woke up from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him,"
Genesis 9:25,"he said,<br>“Cursed be Canaan;<br>The lowest of slaves<br>Shall he be to his brothers.”"

Genesis 11:7,"Let us, then, go down and confound their speech there, so that they shall not understand one another’s speech.”"

Genesis 12:5,"Abram took his wife Sarai and his brother’s son Lot, and all the wealth that they had amassed, and the persons that they had acquired in Haran; and they set out for the land of Canaan. When they arrived in the land of Canaan,"

Genesis 12:8,"From there he moved on to the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and he built there an altar to יהוה and invoked יהוה by name."
Genesis 12:9,Then Abram journeyed by stages toward the Negeb.
Genesis 12:10,"There was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land."
Genesis 12:11,"As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “I<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>I </b>Or “You”; cf. the second-person feminine form -ti in Judg. 5.7; Jer. 2.20; Mic. 4.13, etc.</i> know what a beautiful woman you are."

Genesis 13:5,"Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,"
Genesis 13:6,so that the land could not support them staying together; for their possessions were so great that they could not remain together.
Genesis 13:7,And there was quarreling between the herders of Abram’s cattle and those of Lot’s cattle.—The Canaanites and Perizzites were then dwelling in the land.—
Genesis 13:8,"Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, between my herders and yours, for we are kin."

Genesis 13:12,"Abram remained in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in the cities of the Plain, pitching his tents near Sodom."
Genesis 13:13,Now the inhabitants of Sodom were very wicked sinners against יהוה.
Genesis 13:14,"And יהוה said to Abram, after Lot had parted from him, “Raise your eyes and look out from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west,"
Genesis 13:15,for I give all the land that you see to you and your offspring forever.

Genesis 16:1,"Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. She had an Egyptian maidservant whose name was Hagar."
Genesis 16:2,"And Sarai said to Abram, “Look, יהוה has kept me from bearing. Consort with my maid; perhaps I shall have a child<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>have a child </b>Lit. “be built up,” play on ben “child” and banah “build up.” See the Dictionary under ben.</i> through her.” And Abram heeded Sarai’s request."
Genesis 16:3,"So Sarai, Abram’s wife, took her maid, Hagar the Egyptian—after Abram had dwelt in the land of Canaan ten years—and gave her to her husband Abram as concubine."
Genesis 16:4,"He cohabited with Hagar and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was lowered in her esteem."
Genesis 16:5,"And Sarai said to Abram, “The wrong done me is your fault! I myself put my maid in your bosom; now that she sees that she is pregnant, I am lowered in her esteem. יהוה decide between you and me!”"
Genesis 16:6,"Abram said to Sarai, “Your maid is in your hands. Deal with her as you think right.” Then Sarai treated her harshly, and she ran away from her."
Genesis 16:7,"A messenger of יהוה found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the road to Shur,"
Genesis 16:8,"and said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” And she said, “I am running away from my mistress Sarai.”"

Genesis 16:10,"And the messenger of יהוה said to her,<br>“I will greatly increase your offspring,<br>And they shall be too many to count.”"
Genesis 16:11,"The messenger of יהוה said to her further,<br>“Behold, you are pregnant<br>And shall bear a son;<br>You shall call him Ishmael,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Ishmael </b>I.e., “God heeds.”</i> <br>For יהוה has paid heed to your suffering.<br>"

Genesis 17:8,"I assign the land you sojourn in to you and your offspring to come, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting holding. I will be their God.”"
Genesis 17:9,"God further said to Abraham, “As for you, you and your offspring to come throughout the ages shall keep My covenant."
Genesis 17:10,Such shall be the covenant between Me and you and your offspring to follow which you shall keep: every male among you shall be circumcised.
Genesis 17:11,"You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and that shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you."
Genesis 17:12,"And throughout the generations, every male among you shall be circumcised at the age of eight days. As for the homeborn slave and the one bought from an outsider who is not of your offspring,"
Genesis 17:13,"they must be circumcised, homeborn and purchased alike. Thus shall My covenant be marked in your flesh as an everlasting pact."
Genesis 17:14,"And if any male who is uncircumcised fails to circumcise the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from kin; he has broken My covenant.”"
Genesis 17:15,"And God said to Abraham, “As for your wife Sarai, you shall not call her Sarai, but her name shall be Sarah.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Sarah </b>I.e., “princess.”</i> "
Genesis 17:16,"I will bless her; indeed, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she shall give rise to nations; rulers of peoples shall issue from her.”"
Genesis 17:17,"Abraham threw himself on his face and laughed, as he said to himself, “Can a child be born to a man a hundred years old, or can Sarah bear a child at ninety?”"
Genesis 17:18,"And Abraham said to God, “O that Ishmael might live by Your favor!”"
Genesis 17:19,"God said, “Nevertheless, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac;<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Isaac </b>Heb.

Genesis 17:22,"Done speaking with him, God was gone from Abraham."
Genesis 17:23,"Then Abraham took his son Ishmael, and all his homeborn slaves and all those he had bought, every male in Abraham’s household, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins on that very day, as God had spoken to him."
Genesis 17:24,"Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin,"
Genesis 17:25,and his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

Genesis 18:7,"Then Abraham ran to the herd, took a calf, tender and choice, and gave it to a servant-boy, who hastened to prepare it."
Genesis 18:8,He took curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared and set these before them; and he waited on them under the tree as they ate.
Genesis 18:9,"They said to him, “Where is your wife Sarah?” And he replied, “There, in the tent.”"
Genesis 18:10,"Then one said, “I will return to you next year,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>next year </b>Heb. ka-‘et ḥayyah; cf. Gen. 17.21; 2 Kings 4.16–17.</i> and your wife Sarah shall have a son!” Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which was behind him."

Genesis 18:17,"Now יהוה had said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,"
Genesis 18:18,since Abraham is to become a great and populous nation and all the nations of the earth are to bless themselves by him?
Genesis 18:19,"For I have singled him out, that he may instruct his children and his posterity to keep the way of יהוה by doing what is just and right, in order that יהוה may bring about for Abraham what has been promised him.”"
Genesis 18:20,"Then יהוה said, “The outrage of Sodom and Gomorrah is so great, and their sin so grave!"
Genesis 18:21,"I will go down to see whether they have acted altogether according to the outcry that has reached Me; if not, I will take note.”"
Genesis 18:22,"The agents went on from there to Sodom, while Abraham remained standing before יהוה."
Genesis 18:23,"Abraham came forward and said, “Will You sweep away the innocent along with the guilty?"
Genesis 18:24,What if there should be fifty innocent within the city; will You then wipe out the place and not forgive it for the sake of the innocent fifty who are in it?
Genesis 18:25,"Far be it from You to do such a thing, to bring death upon the innocent as well as the guilty, so that innocent and guilty fare alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?”"
Genesis 18:26,"And יהוה answered, “If I find within the city of Sodom fifty innocent ones, I will forgive the whole place for their sake.”"
Genesis 18:27,"Abraham spoke up, saying, “Here I venture to speak to my lord, I who am but dust and ashes:"
Genesis 18:28,What if the fifty innocent should lack five? Will You destroy the whole city for want of the five?”“I will not destroy if I find forty-five there.”
Genesis 18:29,"But he spoke up again, and said, “What if forty should be found there?”“I will not do it, for the sake of the forty.”"
Genesis 18:30,"And he said, “Let not my lord be angry if I go on: What if thirty should be found there?”“I will not do it if I find thirty there.”"
Genesis 18:31,"And he said, “I venture again to speak to my lord: What if twenty should be found there?”“I will not destroy, for the sake of the twenty.”"
Genesis 18:32,"And he said, “Let not my lord be angry if I speak but this last time: What if ten should be found there?”“I will not destroy, for the sake of the ten.”"
Genesis 18:33,"Having finished speaking to Abraham, יהוה departed; and Abraham returned to his place."
Genesis 19:1,"The two messengers arrived in Sodom in the evening, as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to greet them and, bowing low with his face to the ground,"
Genesis 19:2,"he said, “Please, my lords, turn aside to your servant’s house to spend the night, and bathe your feet; then you may be on your way early.” But they said, “No, we will spend the night in the square.”"
Genesis 19:3,"But he urged them strongly, so they turned his way and entered his house. He prepared a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate."

Genesis 19:12,"Then the agents said to Lot, “Whom else have you here? Sons-in-law, your sons and daughters, or anyone else that you have in the city—bring them out of the place."
Genesis 19:13,For we are about to destroy this place; because the outcry against them before יהוה has become so great that יהוה has sent us to destroy it.”
Genesis 19:14,"So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, and said, “Up, get out of this place, for יהוה is about to destroy the city.” But he seemed to his sons-in-law as one who jests."
Genesis 19:15,"As dawn broke, the messengers urged Lot on, saying, “Up, take your wife and your two remaining daughters, lest you be swept away because of the iniquity of the city.”"
Genesis 19:16,"Still he delayed. So the agents seized his hand, and the hands of his wife and his two daughters—in יהוה’s mercy on him—and brought him out and left him outside the city."
Genesis 19:17,"When they had brought them outside, one said, “Flee for your life! Do not look behind you, nor stop anywhere in the Plain; flee to the hills, lest you be swept away.”"
Genesis 19:18,"But Lot said to them, “Oh no, my lord!"
Genesis 19:19,"You have been so gracious to your servant, and have already shown me so much kindness in order to save my life; but I cannot flee to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die."
Genesis 19:20,"Look, that town there is near enough to flee to; it is such a little place! Let me flee there—it is such a little place—and let my life be saved.”"
Genesis 19:21,"He replied, “Very well, I will grant you this favor too, and I will not annihilate the town of which you have spoken."
Genesis 19:22,"Hurry, flee there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there.” Hence the town came to be called Zoar.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Zoar </b>Connected with miṣ‘ar “a little place,” v. 20.</i> "
Genesis 19:23,"As the sun rose upon the earth and Lot entered Zoar,"
Genesis 19:24,יהוה rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah sulfurous fire from יהוה out of heaven—
Genesis 19:25,"annihilating those cities and the entire Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities and the vegetation of the ground."
Genesis 19:26,"Lot’s<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Lot’s </b>Lit. “His.”</i> wife looked back,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>back </b>Lit. “behind him.”</i> and she thereupon turned into a pillar of salt."
Genesis 19:27,"Next morning, Abraham hurried to the place where he had stood before יהוה,"
Genesis 19:28,"and, looking down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the Plain, he saw the smoke of the land rising like the smoke of a kiln."
Genesis 19:29,"Thus it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain and annihilated the cities where Lot dwelt, God was mindful of Abraham and removed Lot from the midst of the upheaval."
Genesis 19:30,"Lot went up from Zoar and settled in the hill country with his two daughters, for he was afraid to dwell in Zoar; and he and his two daughters lived in a cave."
Genesis 19:31,"And the older one said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to consort with us in the way of all the world."
Genesis 19:32,"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and let us lie with him, that we may maintain life through our father.”"
Genesis 19:33,"That night they made their father drink wine, and the older one went in and lay with her father; he did not know when she lay down or when she rose."
Genesis 19:34,"The next day the older one said to the younger, “See, I lay with Father last night; let us make him drink wine tonight also, and you go and lie with him, that we may maintain life through our father.”"
Genesis 19:35,"That night also they made their father drink wine, and the younger one went and lay with him; he did not know when she lay down or when she rose."
Genesis 19:36,Thus the two daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.
Genesis 19:37,"The older one bore a son and named him Moab;<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Moab </b>As though me-’ab “from (my) father.”</i> he is the father of the Moabites of today."
Genesis 19:38,"And the younger also bore a son, and she called him Ben-ammi;<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Ben-ammi </b>As though “son of my (paternal) kindred.” See further the Dictionary under ‘am.</i> he is the father of the Ammonites of today."
Genesis 20:1,"Abraham journeyed from there to the region of the Negeb and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was sojourning in Gerar,"
Genesis 20:2,"Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him."
Genesis 20:3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, “You are to die because of the woman that you have taken, for she is a married woman.”"
Genesis 20:4,"Now Abimelech had not approached her. He said, “O lord,<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>lord </b>See the Dictionary under “male metaphors for God.”</i> will You slay people even though innocent?"
Genesis 20:5,"He himself said to me, ‘She is my sister’! And she also said, ‘He is my brother.’ When I did this, my heart was blameless and my hands were clean.”"
Genesis 20:6,"And God said to him in the dream, “I knew that you did this with a blameless heart, and so I kept you from sinning against Me. That was why I did not let you touch her."
Genesis 20:7,"Therefore, restore the man’s wife—since he is a prophet, he will intercede for you—to save your life. If you fail to restore her, know that you shall die, you and all that are yours.”"
Genesis 20:8,"Early next morning, Abimelech called his servants and told them all that had happened; and they<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>they </b>Lit. “the [salient] participants.” See the Dictionary under ’ish.</i> were greatly frightened."
Genesis 20:9,"Then Abimelech summoned Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? What wrong have I done that you should bring so great a guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done to me things that ought not to be done."
Genesis 20:10,"What, then,” Abimelech demanded of Abraham, “was your purpose in doing this thing?”"
Genesis 20:11,"“I thought,” said Abraham, “surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife."
Genesis 20:12,"And besides, she is in truth my sister, my father’s daughter though not my mother’s; and she became my wife."
Genesis 20:13,"So when God made me wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘Let this be the kindness that you shall do me: whatever place we come to, say there of me: He is my brother.’”"
Genesis 20:14,"Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves, and gave them to Abraham; and he restored his wife Sarah to him."
Genesis 20:15,"And Abimelech said, “Here, my land is before you; settle wherever you please.”"
Genesis 20:16,"And to Sarah he said, “I herewith give your brother a thousand pieces of silver; this will serve you as vindication<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>vindication </b>Lit. “a covering of the eyes”; meaning of latter half of verse uncertain.</i> before all who are with you, and you are cleared before everyone.”"
Genesis 20:17,"Abraham then prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his slave girls, so that they bore children;"
Genesis 20:18,"for יהוה had closed fast every womb of the household of Abimelech because of Sarah, the wife of Abraham."
Genesis 21:1,"יהוה took note of Sarah as promised, and יהוה did for Sarah what had been announced."
Genesis 21:2,"Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken."
Genesis 21:3,"Abraham gave his newborn son, whom Sarah had borne him, the name of Isaac."
Genesis 21:4,"And when his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him."
Genesis 21:5,Now Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
Genesis 21:6,"Sarah said, “God has brought me laughter; everyone who hears will laugh with<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>with </b>Lit. “for.”</i> me.”"
Genesis 21:7,"And she added,<br>“Who would have said to Abraham<br>That Sarah would suckle children!<br>Yet I have borne a son in his old age.”"
Genesis 21:8,"The child grew up and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned."
Genesis 21:9,Sarah saw the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham playing.
Genesis 21:10,"She said to Abraham, “Cast out that slave-woman and her son, for the son of that slave shall not share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.”"
Genesis 21:11,"The matter distressed Abraham greatly, for it concerned a son of his."
Genesis 21:12,"But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed over the boy or your slave; whatever Sarah tells you, do as she says, for it is through Isaac that offspring shall be continued<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>continued </b>Lit. “called.”</i> for you."
Genesis 21:13,"As for the son of the slave-woman, I will make a nation of him, too, for he is your seed.”"
Genesis 21:14,"Early next morning Abraham took some bread and a skin of water, and gave them to Hagar. He placed them over her shoulder, together with the child, and sent her away. And she wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba."
Genesis 21:15,"When the water was gone from the skin, she left the child under one of the bushes,"
Genesis 21:16,"and went and sat down at a distance, a bowshot away; for she thought, “Let me not look on as the child dies.” And sitting thus afar, she burst into tears."
Genesis 21:17,"God heard the cry of the boy, and a messenger of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heeded the cry of the boy where he is."
Genesis 21:18,"Come, lift up the boy and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him.”"
Genesis 21:19,"Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. She went and filled the skin with water, and let the boy drink."
Genesis 21:20,God was with the boy and he grew up; he dwelt in the wilderness and became skilled with a bow.
Genesis 21:21,He lived in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
Genesis 21:22,"At that time Abimelech and Phicol, chief of his troops, said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything that you do."
Genesis 21:23,"Therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my kith and kin, but will deal with me and with the land in which you have sojourned as loyally as I have dealt with you.”"
Genesis 21:24,"And Abraham said, “I swear it.”"
Genesis 21:25,Then Abraham reproached Abimelech for the well of water which the servants of Abimelech had seized.
Genesis 21:26,"But Abimelech said, “I do not know who did this; you did not tell me, nor have I heard of it until today.”"
Genesis 21:27,"Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a pact."
Genesis 21:28,"Abraham then set seven ewes of the flock by themselves,"
Genesis 21:29,"and Abimelech said to Abraham, “What mean these seven ewes which you have set apart?”"
Genesis 21:30,"He replied, “You are to accept these seven ewes from me as proof that I dug this well.”"
Genesis 21:31,"Hence that place was called Beer-sheba,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Beer-sheba </b>I.e., “well of seven” or “well of oath.”</i> for there the two of them swore an oath."
Genesis 21:32,"When they had concluded the pact at Beer-sheba, Abimelech and Phicol, chief of his troops, departed and returned to the land of the Philistines."
Genesis 21:33,"[Abraham] planted a tamarisk at Beer-sheba, and invoked there the name of יהוה, the Everlasting God."
Genesis 21:34,And Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines a long time.
Genesis 22:1,"Some time afterward, God put Abraham to the test, saying to him, “Abraham.” He answered, “Here I am.”"
Genesis 22:2,"“Take your son, your favored one, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the heights that I will point out to you.”"
Genesis 22:3,"So early next morning, Abraham saddled his ass and took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and he set out for the place of which God had told him."
Genesis 22:4,On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place from afar.
Genesis 22:5,"Then Abraham said to his servants, “You stay here with the ass. The boy and I will go up there; we will worship and we will return to you.”"
Genesis 22:6,"Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and put it on his son Isaac. He himself took the firestone<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>firestone </b>Lit. “fire.”</i> and the knife; and the two walked off together."
Genesis 22:7,"Then Isaac said to his father Abraham, “Father!” And he answered, “Yes, my son.” And he said, “Here are the firestone and the wood; but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?”"
Genesis 22:8,"And Abraham said, “It is God who will see to the sheep for this burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them walked on together."
Genesis 22:9,"They arrived at the place of which God had told him. Abraham built an altar there; he laid out the wood; he bound his son Isaac; he laid him on the altar, on top of the wood."
Genesis 22:10,And Abraham picked up the knife to slay his son.
Genesis 22:11,"Then a messenger of יהוה called to him from heaven: “Abraham! Abraham!” And he answered, “Here I am.”"
Genesis 22:12,"“Do not raise your hand against the boy, or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your favored one, from Me.”"
Genesis 22:13,"When Abraham looked up, his eye fell upon a<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>a </b>Reading ’eḥad with many Heb. mss. and ancient versions; text ’aḥar “after.”</i> ram, caught in the thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering in place of his son."
Genesis 22:14,"And Abraham named that site Adonai-yireh,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Adonai-yireh </b>I.e., “יהוה will see”; cf. v. 8.</i> whence the present saying, “On the mount of יהוה there is vision.”<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>On the mount of יהוה there is vision </b>Heb. be-har y-h-w-h yera’eh.</i> "
Genesis 22:15,"The messenger of יהוה called to Abraham a second time from heaven,"
Genesis 22:16,"and said, “By Myself I swear, יהוה declares: Because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your favored one,"
Genesis 22:17,I will bestow My blessing upon you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven and the sands on the seashore; and your descendants shall seize the gates of their foes.
Genesis 22:18,"All the nations of the earth shall bless themselves by your descendants, because you have obeyed My command.”"
Genesis 22:19,"Abraham then returned to his servants, and they departed together for Beer-sheba; and Abraham stayed in Beer-sheba."
Genesis 22:20,"Some time later, Abraham was told, “Milcah too has borne sons to your brother Nahor:"
Genesis 22:21,"Uz the first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram;"
Genesis 22:22,"and Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel”—"
Genesis 22:23,"Bethuel being the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother."
Genesis 22:24,"And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore [sons]—Tebah, Gaham, and Tahash—and [a daughter,]<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>[a daughter] </b>As implied.

Genesis 23:1,Sarah’s lifetime—the span of Sarah’s life—came to one hundred and twenty-seven years.
Genesis 23:2,Sarah died in Kiriath-arba—now Hebron—in the land of Canaan; and Abraham proceeded to mourn for Sarah and to bewail her.
Genesis 23:3,"Then Abraham rose from beside his dead, and spoke to the Hittites, saying,"
Genesis 23:4,"“I am a resident alien among you; sell me a burial site among you, that I may remove my dead for burial.”"
Genesis 23:5,"And the Hittites replied to Abraham, saying to him,"
Genesis 23:6,"“Hear us, my lord: you are the elect of God among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places; none of us will withhold his burial place from you for burying your dead.”"
Genesis 23:7,"Thereupon Abraham bowed low to the landowning citizens,<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>landowning citizens </b>Heb. ‘am ha-’areṣ; lit. “people of the land.” See the Dictionary under ‘am.</i> the Hittites,"
Genesis 23:8,"and he said to them, “If it is your wish that I remove my dead for burial, you must agree to intercede for me with Ephron son of Zohar."
Genesis 23:9,"Let him sell me the cave of Machpelah that he owns, which is at the edge of his land. Let him sell it to me, at the full price, for a burial site in your midst.”"
Genesis 23:10,"Ephron was present among the Hittites; so Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, the assembly in his town’s gate,<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>the assembly in his town’s gate </b>Lit. “all who entered the gate of his town.” So NJPS, with a note: “I.e., all his fellow townsmen.” Cf. 34.20; Prov. 31.23.</i> saying,"
Genesis 23:11,"“No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field and I give you the cave that is in it; I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.”"
Genesis 23:12,"Then Abraham bowed low before the landowning citizens,"
Genesis 23:13,"and spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the landowning citizens, saying, “If only you would hear me out! Let me pay the price of the land; accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there.”"
Genesis 23:14,"And Ephron replied to Abraham, saying to him,"
Genesis 23:15,"“My lord, do hear me! A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver—what is that between you and me? Go and bury your dead.”"
Genesis 23:16,Abraham accepted Ephron’s terms. Abraham paid out to Ephron the money that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites—four hundred shekels of silver at the going merchants’ rate.
Genesis 23:17,"So Ephron’s land in Machpelah, near Mamre—the field with its cave and all the trees anywhere within the confines of that field—passed"
Genesis 23:18,"to Abraham as his possession, in the presence of the Hittites, of the assembly in his town’s gate."
Genesis 23:19,"And then Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field of Machpelah, facing Mamre—now Hebron—in the land of Canaan."
Genesis 23:20,"Thus the field with its cave passed from the Hittites to Abraham, as a burial site."
Genesis 24:1,"Abraham was now old, advanced in years, and יהוה had blessed Abraham in all things."
Genesis 24:2,"And Abraham said to the senior servant of his household, who had charge of all that he owned, “Put your hand under my thigh"
Genesis 24:3,"and I will make you swear by יהוה, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell,"
Genesis 24:4,but will go to the land of my birth and get a wife for my son Isaac.”
Genesis 24:5,"And the servant said to him, “What if the woman does not consent to follow me to this land, shall I then take your son back to the land from which you came?”"
Genesis 24:6,"Abraham answered him, “On no account must you take my son back there!"
Genesis 24:7,"יהוה, the God of heaven—who took me from my father’s house and from my native land, who promised me on oath, saying, ‘I will assign this land to your offspring’—will send a messenger before you, and you will get a wife for my son from there."
Genesis 24:8,"And if the woman does not consent to follow you, you shall then be clear of this oath to me; but do not take my son back there.”"
Genesis 24:9,"So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore to him as bidden.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>as bidden </b>Lit. “about this matter.”</i> "
Genesis 24:10,"Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and set out, taking with him all the bounty of his master; and he made his way to Aram-naharaim, to the city of Nahor."
Genesis 24:11,"He made the camels kneel down by the well outside the city, at evening time, the time when women come out to draw water."
Genesis 24:12,"And he said, “O יהוה, God of my master Abraham’s [house], grant me good fortune this day, and deal graciously with my master Abraham:"
Genesis 24:13,"Here I stand by the spring as the daughters of the townspeople<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>townspeople </b>Or “town’s householders.”</i> come out to draw water;"
Genesis 24:14,"let the maiden to whom I say, ‘Please, lower your jar that I may drink,’ and who replies, ‘Drink, and I will also water your camels’—let her be the one whom You have decreed for Your servant Isaac. Thereby shall I know that You have dealt graciously with my master.”"
Genesis 24:15,"He had scarcely finished speaking, when Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel, the son of Milcah the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor, came out with her jar on her shoulder."
Genesis 24:16,"The maiden was very beautiful—[and] a virgin, no man having known her.<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>[and] a virgin, no man having known her </b>Or “a young woman whom no man had known.”</i> She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up."
Genesis 24:17,"The servant ran toward her and said, “Please, let me sip a little water from your jar.”"
Genesis 24:18,"“Drink, my lord,” she said, and she quickly lowered her jar upon her hand and let him drink."
Genesis 24:19,"When she had let him drink his fill, she said, “I will also draw for your camels, until they finish drinking.”"
Genesis 24:20,"Quickly emptying her jar into the trough, she ran back to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels."
Genesis 24:21,"The man,<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>man </b>Or “agent.” Lit. “participant whose involvement defines the depicted situation.” See note at 18.2 and the Dictionary under ’ish; Agent.</i> meanwhile, stood gazing at her, silently wondering whether יהוה had made his errand successful or not."
Genesis 24:22,"When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold nose-ring weighing a half-shekel,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>half-shekel </b>Heb. beqa‘.</i> and two gold bands for her arms, ten shekels in weight."
Genesis 24:23,"“Pray tell me,” he said, “whose daughter are you? Is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”"
Genesis 24:24,"She replied, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”"
Genesis 24:25,"And she went on, “There is plenty of straw<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>straw </b>Heb. teben, shredded straw, which in the East is mixed with feed; cf. v. 32.</i> and feed at home, and also room to spend the night.”"
Genesis 24:26,The man bowed low in homage to יהוה
Genesis 24:27,"and said, “Blessed be יהוה, the God of my master Abraham’s [house], who has not withheld steadfast faithfulness from my master. For I have been guided on my errand by יהוה, to the house of my master’s kin.”"
Genesis 24:28,The maiden ran and told all this to her mother’s household.
Genesis 24:29,Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man at the spring—
Genesis 24:30,"when he saw the nose-ring and the bands on his sister’s arms, and when he heard his sister Rebekah say, “Thus the man spoke to me.” He went up to the man, who was still standing beside the camels at the spring."
Genesis 24:31,"“Come in, O blessed of יהוה,” he said, “why do you remain outside, when I have made ready the house and a place for the camels?”"
Genesis 24:32,"So the man entered the house, and the camels were unloaded. The camels were given straw and feed, and water was brought to bathe his feet and the feet of the entourage<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>entourage </b>Lit. “participants”; trad. “men.” See Dictionary under ’ish.</i> under him."
Genesis 24:33,"But when food was set before him, he said, “I will not eat until I have told my tale.” He said, “Speak, then.”"
Genesis 24:34,"“I am Abraham’s servant,” he began."
Genesis 24:35,"“יהוה has greatly blessed my master, who has become rich—giving him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female slaves, camels and asses."
Genesis 24:36,"And Sarah, my master’s wife, bore my master a son in her old age, and he has assigned to him everything he owns."
Genesis 24:37,"Now my master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I dwell;"
Genesis 24:38,"but you shall go to my father’s house, to my kindred, and get a wife for my son.’"
Genesis 24:39,"And I said to my master, ‘What if the woman does not follow me?’"
Genesis 24:40,"He replied to me, ‘יהוה, whose ways I have followed, will send a messenger with you and make your errand successful; and you will get a wife for my son from my kindred, from my father’s house."
Genesis 24:41,"Thus only shall you be freed from my adjuration: if, when you come to my kindred, they refuse you—only then shall you be freed from my adjuration.’"
Genesis 24:42,"“I came today to the spring, and I said: O יהוה, God of my master Abraham’s [house], if You would indeed grant success to the errand on which I am engaged!"
Genesis 24:43,"As I stand by the spring of water, let the young woman who comes out to draw and to whom I say, ‘Please, let me drink a little water from your jar,’"
Genesis 24:44,"and who answers, ‘You may drink, and I will also draw for your camels’—let her be the wife whom יהוה has decreed for my master’s son.’"
Genesis 24:45,"I had scarcely finished praying in my heart, when Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder, and went down to the spring and drew. And I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’"
Genesis 24:46,"She quickly lowered her jar and said, ‘Drink, and I will also water your camels.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels."
Genesis 24:47,"I inquired of her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.’ And I put the ring on her nose and the bands on her arms."
Genesis 24:48,"Then I bowed low in homage to יהוה and blessed יהוה, the God of my master Abraham’s [house], who led me on the right way to get the daughter of my master’s brother for his son."
Genesis 24:49,"And now, if you mean to treat my master with true kindness, tell me; and if not, tell me also, that I may turn right or left.”"
Genesis 24:50,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The matter was decreed by יהוה; we cannot speak to you bad or good."
Genesis 24:51,"Here is Rebekah before you; take her and go, and let her be a wife to your master’s son, as יהוה has spoken.”"
Genesis 24:52,"When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed low to the ground before יהוה."
Genesis 24:53,"The servant brought out objects of silver and gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; and he gave presents to her brother and her mother."
Genesis 24:54,"Then he and the entourage under him ate and drank, and they spent the night. When they arose next morning, he said, “Give me leave to go to my master.”"
Genesis 24:55,"But her brother and her mother said, “Let the maiden remain with us some ten days;<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>some ten days </b>Lit. “days or ten.”</i> then you may go.”"
Genesis 24:56,"He said to them, “Do not delay me, now that יהוה has made my errand successful. Give me leave that I may go to my master.”"
Genesis 24:57,"And they said, “Let us call the girl and ask for her reply.”"
Genesis 24:58,"They called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>man </b>See note at v. 21.</i> ?” And she said, “I will.”"
Genesis 24:59,So they sent off their sister Rebekah and her nurse along with Abraham’s servant and his entourage.
Genesis 24:60,"And they blessed Rebekah and said to her,<br>“O sister!<br>May you grow<br>Into thousands of myriads;<br>May your descendants seize<br>The gates of their foes.”"
Genesis 24:61,"Then Rebekah and her maids arose, mounted the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and went his way."
Genesis 24:62,"Isaac had just come back from the vicinity of Beer-lahai-roi, for he was settled in the region of the Negeb."
Genesis 24:63,"And Isaac went out walking<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>walking </b>Meaning of Heb. lasuaḥ uncertain; others “to meditate.”</i> in the field toward evening and, looking up, he saw camels approaching."
Genesis 24:64,"Raising her eyes, Rebekah saw Isaac. She alighted from the camel"
Genesis 24:65,"and said to the servant, “Who is that man walking in the field toward us?” And the servant said, “That is my master.” So she took her veil and covered herself."
Genesis 24:66,The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
Genesis 24:67,"Isaac then brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he took Rebekah as his wife. Isaac loved her, and thus found comfort after his mother’s death."
Genesis 25:1,"Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah."
Genesis 25:2,"She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah."
Genesis 25:3,"Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. The descendants of Dedan were the Asshurim, the Letushim, and the Leummim."
Genesis 25:4,"The descendants of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Enoch,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Enoch </b>Or “Hanoch.”</i> Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah."
Genesis 25:5,Abraham willed all that he owned to Isaac;
Genesis 25:6,"but to Abraham’s sons by concubines Abraham gave gifts while he was still living, and he sent them away from his son Isaac eastward, to the land of the East."
Genesis 25:7,This was the total span of Abraham’s life: one hundred and seventy-five years.
Genesis 25:8,"And Abraham breathed his last, dying at a good ripe age, old and contented; and he was gathered to his kin.<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>kin </b>(So NJPS.) See the Dictionary under “predecessors.”</i> "
Genesis 25:9,"His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, facing Mamre,"
Genesis 25:10,"the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites; there Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife."
Genesis 25:11,"After the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac settled near Beer-lahai-roi."
Genesis 25:12,"This is the line of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s slave, bore to Abraham."
Genesis 25:13,"These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the first-born of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,"
Genesis 25:14,"Mishma, Dumah, Massa,"
Genesis 25:15,"Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedmah."
Genesis 25:16,These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names by their villages and by their encampments: twelve chieftains of as many tribes.—
Genesis 25:17,"These were the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven years; then he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his kin.—"
Genesis 25:18,"They dwelt from Havilah, by Shur, which is close to Egypt, all the way to Asshur; they camped alongside all their kin."
Genesis 25:19,"This is the story of Isaac, son of Abraham. Abraham begot Isaac."
Genesis 25:20,"Isaac was forty years old when he took to wife Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, sister of Laban the Aramean."
Genesis 25:21,"Isaac pleaded with יהוה on behalf of his wife, because she was barren; and יהוה responded to his plea, and his wife Rebekah conceived."
Genesis 25:22,"But the children struggled in her womb, and she said, “If so, why do I exist?”<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>why do I exist? </b>Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> She went to inquire of יהוה,"
Genesis 25:23,"and יהוה answered her,<br>“Two nations are in your womb,<br>Two separate peoples shall issue from your body;<br>One people shall be mightier than the other,<br>And the older shall serve the younger.”"
Genesis 25:24,"When her time to give birth was at hand, there were twins in her womb."
Genesis 25:25,"The first one emerged red, like a hairy mantle all over; so they named him Esau.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Esau </b>Synonym of “Seir,” play on Heb. se‘ar “hair.”</i> "
Genesis 25:26,"Then his brother emerged, holding on to the heel of Esau; so they named him Jacob.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Jacob </b>Play on Heb. ‘aqeb “heel.”</i> Isaac was sixty years old when they were born."

Genesis 25:29,"Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the open, famished."
Genesis 25:30,"And Esau said to Jacob, “Give me some of that red stuff to gulp down, for I am famished”—which is why he was named Edom.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Edom </b>Play on Heb. ’adom “red.”</i> "
Genesis 25:31,"Jacob said, “First sell me your birthright.”"
Genesis 25:32,"And Esau said, “I am at the point of death, so of what use is my birthright to me?”"
Genesis 25:33,"But Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob."
Genesis 25:34,"Jacob then gave Esau bread and lentil stew; he ate and drank, and he rose and went away. Thus did Esau spurn the birthright."
Genesis 26:1,"There was a famine in the land—aside from the previous famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham—and Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, in Gerar."
Genesis 26:2," יהוה had appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; stay in the land which I point out to you."
Genesis 26:3,"Reside in this land, and I will be with you and bless you; I will assign all these lands to you and to your heirs, fulfilling the oath that I swore to your father Abraham."

Genesis 26:8,"When some time had passed, Abimelech king of the Philistines, looking out of the window, saw Isaac fondling his wife Rebekah."
Genesis 26:9,"Abimelech sent for Isaac and said, “So she is your wife! Why then did you say: ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac said to him, “Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her.”"

Genesis 26:15,"And the Philistines stopped up all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham, filling them with earth."

Genesis 26:19,"But when Isaac’s servants, digging in the wadi, found there a well of spring water,"
Genesis 26:20,"the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” He named that well Esek,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Esek </b>I.e., “contention.”</i> because they contended with him."
Genesis 26:21,"And when they dug another well, they disputed over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Sitnah </b>I.e., “harassment.”</i> "
Genesis 26:22,"He moved from there and dug yet another well, and they did not quarrel over it; so he called it Rehoboth, saying, “Now at last יהוה has granted us ample space<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>ample space </b>Heb. hirḥib, connected with “Rehoboth.”</i> to increase in the land.”"
Genesis 26:23,From there he went up to Beer-sheba.
Genesis 26:24,"That night יהוה appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham’s [house]. Fear not, for I am with you, and I will bless you and increase your offspring for the sake of My servant Abraham.”"
Genesis 26:25,So he built an altar there and invoked יהוה by name. Isaac pitched his tent there and his servants started digging a well.
Genesis 26:26,"And Abimelech came to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his councilor and Phicol chief of his troops."
Genesis 26:27,"Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, seeing that you have been hostile to me and have driven me away from you?”"
Genesis 26:28,"And they said, “We now see plainly that יהוה has been with you, and we thought: Let there be a sworn treaty between our two parties, between you and us. Let us make a pact with you"
Genesis 26:29,"that you will not do us harm, just as we have not molested you but have always dealt kindly with you and sent you away in peace. From now on, be you blessed of יהוה !”"
Genesis 26:30,"Then he made for them a feast, and they ate and drank."
Genesis 26:31,"Early in the morning, they exchanged oaths. Isaac then bade them farewell, and they departed from him in peace."
Genesis 26:32,"That same day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water!”"
Genesis 26:33,"He named it Shibah;<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Shibah </b>As though “oath.”</i> therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day."
Genesis 26:34,"When Esau was forty years old, he took to wife Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite;"
Genesis 26:35,and they were a source of bitterness to Isaac and Rebekah.
Genesis 27:1,"When Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, he called his older son Esau and said to him, “My son.” He answered, “Here I am.”"
Genesis 27:2,"And he said, “I am old now, and I do not know how soon I may die."
Genesis 27:3,"Take your gear, your quiver and bow, and go out into the open and hunt me some game."
Genesis 27:4,"Then prepare a dish for me such as I like, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my innermost blessing before I die.”"
Genesis 27:5,"Rebekah had been listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau had gone out into the open to hunt game to bring home,"
Genesis 27:6,"Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “I overheard your father speaking to your brother Esau, saying,"
Genesis 27:7,"‘Bring me some game and prepare a dish for me to eat, that I may bless you, with יהוה’s approval, before I die.’"
Genesis 27:8,"Now, my son, listen carefully as I instruct you."
Genesis 27:9,"Go to the flock and fetch me two choice kids, and I will make of them a dish for your father, such as he likes."
Genesis 27:10,"Then take it to your father to eat, in order that he may bless you before he dies.”"
Genesis 27:11,"Jacob answered his mother Rebekah, “But my brother Esau is a hairy man and I am smooth-skinned."
Genesis 27:12,"If my father touches me, I shall appear to him as a trickster and bring upon myself a curse, not a blessing.”"
Genesis 27:13,"But his mother said to him, “Your curse, my son, be upon me! Just do as I say and go fetch them for me.”"
Genesis 27:14,"He got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared a dish such as his father liked."
Genesis 27:15,"Rebekah then took the best clothes of her older son Esau, which were there<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>there </b>Or “in her charge”—an acknowledgment of authority; Heb. ’itah, lit. “with her.”</i> in the house, and had her younger son Jacob put them on;"
Genesis 27:16,and she covered his hands and the hairless part of his neck with the skins of the kids.
Genesis 27:17,Then she put in the hands of her son Jacob the dish and the bread that she had prepared.
Genesis 27:18,"He went to his father and said, “Father.” And he said, “Yes, which of my sons are you?”"
Genesis 27:19,"Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau, your first-born; I have done as you told me. Pray sit up and eat of my game, that you may give me your innermost blessing.”"
Genesis 27:20,"Isaac said to his son, “How did you succeed so quickly, my son?” And he said, “Because your God יהוה granted me good fortune.”"
Genesis 27:21,"Isaac said to Jacob, “Come closer that I may feel you, my son—whether you are really my son Esau or not.”"
Genesis 27:22,"So Jacob drew close to his father Isaac, who felt him and wondered. “The voice is the voice of Jacob, yet the hands are the hands of Esau.”"
Genesis 27:23,"He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; and so he blessed him."
Genesis 27:24,"He asked, “Are you really my son Esau?” And when he said, “I am,”"
Genesis 27:25,"he said, “Serve me and let me eat of my son’s game that I may give you my innermost blessing.” So he served him and he ate, and he brought him wine and he drank."
Genesis 27:26,"Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come close and kiss me, my son”;"
Genesis 27:27,"and he went up and kissed him. And he smelled his clothes and he blessed him, saying, “Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of the fields that יהוה has blessed.<br>"
Genesis 27:28,"“May God give you<br>Of the dew of heaven and the fat of the earth,<br>Abundance of new grain and wine.<br>"
Genesis 27:29,"Let peoples serve you,<br>And nations bow to you;<br>Be master over your brothers,<br>And let your mother’s sons bow to you.<br>Cursed be they who curse you,<br>Blessed they who bless you.”"
Genesis 27:30,No sooner had Jacob left the presence of his father Isaac—after Isaac had finished blessing Jacob—than his brother Esau came back from his hunt.
Genesis 27:31,"He too prepared a dish and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, “Let my father sit up and eat of his son’s game, so that you may give me your innermost blessing.”"
Genesis 27:32,"His father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” And he said, “I am your son, Esau, your first-born!”"
Genesis 27:33,"Isaac was seized with very violent trembling. “Who was it then,” he demanded, “that hunted game and brought it to me? Moreover, I ate of it before you came, and I blessed him; now he must remain blessed!”"
Genesis 27:34,"When Esau heard his father’s words, he burst into wild and bitter sobbing, and said to his father, “Bless me too, Father!”"
Genesis 27:35,"But he answered, “Your brother came with guile and took away your blessing.”"
Genesis 27:36,"[Esau] said, “Was he, then, named Jacob that he might supplant<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>supplant </b>Heb. ‘aqab, connected with “Jacob.”</i> me these two times? First he took away my birthright and now he has taken away my blessing!” And he added, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”"
Genesis 27:37,"Isaac answered, saying to Esau, “But I have made him master over you: I have given him all his brothers for servants, and sustained him with grain and wine. What, then, can I still do for you, my son?”"
Genesis 27:38,"And Esau said to his father, “Have you but one blessing, Father? Bless me too, Father!” And Esau wept aloud."
Genesis 27:39,"And his father Isaac answered, saying to him,<br>“See, your abode shall enjoy the fat of the earth<br>And<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>enjoy the fat of the earth / And </b>Others “be away from the fat of the earth and from.”</i> the dew of heaven above.<br>"
Genesis 27:40,"Yet by your sword you shall live,<br>And you shall serve your brother;<br>But when you grow restive,<br>You shall break his yoke from your neck.”"
Genesis 27:41,"Now Esau harbored a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing which his father had given him, and Esau said to himself, “Let but the mourning period of my father come, and I will kill my brother Jacob.”"
Genesis 27:42,"When the words of her older son Esau were reported to Rebekah, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother Esau is consoling himself by planning to kill you."
Genesis 27:43,"Now, my son, listen to me. Flee at once to Haran, to my brother Laban."
Genesis 27:44,"Stay with him a while, until your brother’s fury subsides—"
Genesis 27:45,until your brother’s anger against you subsides—and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will fetch you from there. Let me not lose you both in one day!”
Genesis 27:46,"Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am disgusted with my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries a Hittite woman like these, from among the native women, what good will life be to me?”"
Genesis 28:1,"So Isaac sent for Jacob and blessed him. He instructed him, saying, “You shall not take a wife from among the Canaanite women."
Genesis 28:2,"Up, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother’s father, and take a wife there from among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother."
Genesis 28:3,"May El Shaddai<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>El Shaddai </b>See note at 17.1.</i> bless you, make you fertile and numerous, so that you become an assembly of peoples."
Genesis 28:4,"May you and your offspring be granted the blessing of Abraham, that you may possess the land where you are sojourning, which God assigned to Abraham.”"
Genesis 28:5,"Then Isaac sent Jacob off, and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, mother of Jacob and Esau."
Genesis 28:6,"When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him off to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, charging him, as he blessed him, “You shall not take a wife from among the Canaanite women,”"
Genesis 28:7,"and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and gone to Paddan-aram,"
Genesis 28:8,Esau realized that the Canaanite women displeased his father Isaac.
Genesis 28:9,"So Esau went to Ishmael and took to wife, in addition to the wives he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, sister of Nebaioth."
Genesis 28:10,"Jacob left Beer-sheba, and set out for Haran."
Genesis 28:11,"He came upon a certain place and stopped there for the night, for the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of that place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place."
Genesis 28:12,"He had a dream; a stairway<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>stairway </b>Or “ramp”; others “ladder.” Heb. sullam.</i> was set on the ground and its top reached to the sky, and messengers of God were going up and down on it."
Genesis 28:13,"And standing beside him was יהוה, who said, “I am יהוה, the God of your father Abraham’s [house] and the God of Isaac’s [house]: the ground on which you are lying I will assign to you and to your offspring."
Genesis 28:14,"Your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All the families of the earth shall bless themselves by you and your descendants."
Genesis 28:15,"Remember, I am with you: I will protect you wherever you go and will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”"
Genesis 28:16,"Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely יהוה is present in this place, and I did not know it!”"
Genesis 28:17,"Shaken, he said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven.”"
Genesis 28:18,"Early in the morning, Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on the top of it."
Genesis 28:19,"He named that site Bethel;<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Bethel </b>I.e., “house of God.”</i> but previously the name of the city had been Luz."
Genesis 28:20,"Jacob then made a vow, saying, “If God remains with me, protecting me on this journey that I am making, and giving me bread to eat and clothing to wear,"
Genesis 28:21,and I return safe to my father’s house— יהוה shall be my God.
Genesis 28:22,"And this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, shall be God’s abode; and of all that You give me, I will set aside a tithe for You.”"
Genesis 29:1,"Jacob resumed his journey<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>resumed his journey </b>Lit. “lifted up his feet.”</i> and came to the land of the Easterners."
Genesis 29:2,"There before his eyes was a well in the open. Three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it, for the flocks were watered from that well. The stone on the mouth of the well was large."
Genesis 29:3,"When all the flocks were gathered there, the stone would be rolled from the mouth of the well and the sheep watered; then the stone would be put back in its place on the mouth of the well."
Genesis 29:4,"Jacob said to them, “My friends, where are you from?” And they said, “We are from Haran.”"
Genesis 29:5,"He said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?” And they said, “Yes, we do.”"
Genesis 29:6,"He continued, “Is he well?” They answered, “Yes, he is; and there is his daughter Rachel, coming with the flock.”"
Genesis 29:7,"He said, “It is still broad daylight, too early to round up the animals; water the flock and take them to pasture.”"
Genesis 29:8,"But they said, “We cannot, until all the flocks are rounded up; then the stone is rolled off the mouth of the well and we water the sheep.”"
Genesis 29:9,"While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s flock—for she was its shepherd."
Genesis 29:10,"And when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his uncle<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>uncle </b>Lit. “mother’s brother.”</i> Laban, and the flock of his uncle Laban, Jacob went up and rolled the stone off the mouth of the well, and watered the flock of his uncle Laban."
Genesis 29:11,"Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and broke into tears."
Genesis 29:12,"Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s kinsman, that he was Rebekah’s son; and she ran and told her father."
Genesis 29:13,"On hearing the news of his sister’s son Jacob, Laban ran to greet him; he embraced him and kissed him, and took him into his house. He told Laban all that had happened,"
Genesis 29:14,"and Laban said to him, “You are truly my bone and flesh.”When he had stayed with him a month’s time,"
Genesis 29:15,"Laban said to Jacob, “Just because you are a kinsman, should you serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?”"
Genesis 29:16,"Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older one was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
Genesis 29:17,Leah had weak eyes; Rachel was shapely and beautiful.
Genesis 29:18,"Jacob loved Rachel; so he answered, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”"
Genesis 29:19,"Laban said, “Better that I give her to you than that I should give her to an outsider. Stay with me.”"
Genesis 29:20,So Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed to him but a few days because of his love for her.
Genesis 29:21,"Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my time is fulfilled, that I may cohabit with her.”"
Genesis 29:22,"And Laban gathered all the people of the place<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>people of the place </b>Or “the locals” or “the local dignitaries,” whose presence clearly validated a marriage; Heb. ’anshe ha-maqom. See the Dictionary under ’ish.</i> and made a feast."
Genesis 29:23,"When evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to him; and he cohabited with her.—"
Genesis 29:24,Laban had given his maidservant Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maid.—
Genesis 29:25,"When morning came, there was Leah! So he said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? I was in your service for Rachel! Why did you deceive me?”"
Genesis 29:26,"Laban said, “It is not the practice in our place to marry off the younger before the older."
Genesis 29:27,"Wait until the bridal week of this one is over and we will give you that one too, provided you serve me another seven years.”"
Genesis 29:28,"Jacob did so; he waited out the bridal week of the one, and then he gave him his daughter Rachel as wife.—"
Genesis 29:29,Laban had given his maidservant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maid.—
Genesis 29:30,"And Jacob cohabited with Rachel also; indeed, he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served him another seven years."
Genesis 29:31,"Seeing that Leah was unloved, יהוה opened her womb; but Rachel was barren."
Genesis 29:32,"Leah conceived and bore a son, and named him Reuben;<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Reuben </b>Understood as “See a son.”</i> for she declared, “It means: ‘יהוה has seen<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>has seen </b>Heb. ra’ah, connected with the first part of “Reuben.”</i> my affliction’; it also means: ‘Now my husband will love me.’”<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>will love me </b>Heb. ye’ehabani, connected with the end of “Reuben.”</i> "
Genesis 29:33,"She conceived again and bore a son, and declared, “This is because יהוה heard<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>heard </b>Heb. shama‘, connected with “Simeon.”</i> that I was unloved and has given me this one also”; so she named him Simeon."
Genesis 29:34,"Again she conceived and bore a son and declared, “This time my husband will become attached<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>will become attached </b>Heb. yillaweh, connected with “Levi.”</i> to me, for I have borne him three sons.” Therefore he was named Levi."
Genesis 29:35,"She conceived again and bore a son, and declared, “This time I will praise<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>I will praise </b>Heb. ’odeh, connected with “Judah.”</i> יהוה.” Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing."
Genesis 30:1,"When Rachel saw that she had borne Jacob no children, she became envious of her sister; and Rachel said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I shall die.”"
Genesis 30:2,"Jacob was incensed at Rachel, and said, “Can I take the place of God, who has denied you fruit of the womb?”"
Genesis 30:3,"She said, “Here is my maid Bilhah. Consort with her, that she may bear on my knees and that through her I too may have children.”"
Genesis 30:4,"So she gave him her maid Bilhah as concubine, and Jacob cohabited with her."
Genesis 30:5,Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
Genesis 30:6,"And Rachel said, “God has vindicated me;<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>has vindicated me </b>Heb. dananni, connected with “Dan.”</i> indeed, [God] has heeded my plea and given me a son.” Therefore she named him Dan."
Genesis 30:7,Rachel’s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
Genesis 30:8,"And Rachel said, “A fateful contest I waged<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>A fateful contest I waged </b>Heb. naphtule … naphtalti, connected with “Naphtali.” Lit. “A contest of God….”</i> with my sister; yes, and I have prevailed.” So she named him Naphtali."
Genesis 30:9,"When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing children, she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as concubine."
Genesis 30:10,"And when Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son,"
Genesis 30:11,"Leah said, “What luck!”<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>What luck! </b>So the kethib, which reads begad; the qere reads ba’ gad “luck has come”; connected with “Gad.”</i> So she named him Gad."
Genesis 30:12,"When Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son,"
Genesis 30:13,"Leah declared, “What fortune!”<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>What fortune! </b>Heb. be’oshri, connected with “Asher.”</i> meaning, “Women will deem me fortunate.” So she named him Asher."
Genesis 30:14,"Once, at the time of the wheat harvest, Reuben came upon some mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”"
Genesis 30:15,"But she said to her, “Was it not enough for you to take away my husband, that you would also take my son’s mandrakes?” Rachel replied, “I promise, he shall lie with you tonight, in return for your son’s mandrakes.”"
Genesis 30:16,"When Jacob came home from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You are to sleep with me, for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” And he lay with her that night."
Genesis 30:17,"God heeded Leah, and she conceived and bore him a fifth son."
Genesis 30:18,"And Leah said, “God has given me my reward<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>my reward </b>Heb. sekhari, connected with “Issachar.”</i> for having given my maid to my husband.” So she named him Issachar."
Genesis 30:19,"When Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son,"
Genesis 30:20,"Leah said, “God has given me a choice gift;<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>has given me a choice gift </b>Heb. zebadani … zebed.</i> this time my husband will exalt me,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>will exalt me </b>Heb. yizbeleni; others “will dwell with me.”</i> for I have borne him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun."
Genesis 30:21,"Last, she bore him a daughter, and named her Dinah."
Genesis 30:22,Now God remembered Rachel; God heeded her and opened her womb.
Genesis 30:23,"She conceived and bore a son, and said, “God has taken away<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>has taken away </b>Heb. ’asaph, connected with “Joseph.”</i> my disgrace.”"
Genesis 30:24,"So she named him Joseph, which is to say, “May יהוה add<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>add </b>Heb. yoseph, connected with “Joseph.”</i> another son for me.”"
Genesis 30:25,"After Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Give me leave to go back to my own homeland."
Genesis 30:26,"Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, that I may go; for well you know what services I have rendered you.”"
Genesis 30:27,"But Laban said to him, “If you will indulge me,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>If you will indulge me </b>Lit. “If I have found favor in your eyes.”</i> I have learned by divination that יהוה has blessed me on your account.”"
Genesis 30:28,"And he continued, “Name the wages due from me, and I will pay you.”"
Genesis 30:29,"But he said, “You know well how I have served you and how your livestock has fared with me."
Genesis 30:30,"For the little you had before I came has grown to much, since יהוה has blessed you wherever I turned. And now, when shall I make provision for my own household?”"
Genesis 30:31,"He said, “What shall I pay you?” And Jacob said, “Pay me nothing! If you will do this thing for me, I will again pasture and keep your flocks:"
Genesis 30:32,"let me pass through your whole flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted animal—every dark-colored sheep and every spotted and speckled goat. Such shall be my wages."
Genesis 30:33,"In the future when you go over my wages, let my honesty toward you testify for me: if there are among my goats any that are not speckled or spotted or any sheep that are not dark-colored, they got there by theft.”"
Genesis 30:34,"And Laban said, “Very well, let it be as you say.”"
Genesis 30:35,"But that same day he removed the streaked and spotted he-goats and all the speckled and spotted she-goats—every one that had white on it—and all the dark-colored sheep, and left them in the charge of his sons."
Genesis 30:36,"And he put a distance of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob was pasturing the rest of Laban’s flock."
Genesis 30:37,"Jacob then got fresh shoots of poplar, and of almond and plane, and peeled white stripes in them, laying bare the white of the shoots."
Genesis 30:38,"The rods that he had peeled he set up in front of the goats<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>goats </b>Lit. “flocks.”</i> in the troughs, the water receptacles, that the goats came to drink from. Their mating occurred when they came to drink,"
Genesis 30:39,"and since the goats mated by the rods, the goats brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted young."
Genesis 30:40,"But Jacob dealt separately with the sheep; he made these animals face the streaked or wholly dark-colored animals in Laban’s flock. And so he produced special flocks for himself, which he did not put with Laban’s flocks."
Genesis 30:41,"Moreover, when the sturdier<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>sturdier </b>Or “early-breeding.”</i> animals were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the troughs, in full view of the animals, so that they mated by the rods;"
Genesis 30:42,"but with the feebler<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>feebler </b>Or “late-breeding.”</i> animals he would not place them there. Thus the feeble<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>feeble </b>Cf. previous note.</i> ones went to Laban and the sturdy to Jacob."
Genesis 30:43,"So the man grew exceedingly prosperous, and came to own large flocks, maidservants and menservants, camels and asses."
Genesis 31:1,"Now he heard the things that Laban’s sons were saying: “Jacob has taken all that was our father’s, and from that which was our father’s he has built up all this wealth.”"
Genesis 31:2,Jacob also saw that Laban’s manner toward him was not as it had been in the past.
Genesis 31:3,"Then יהוה said to Jacob, “Return to your ancestors’ land—where you were born—and I will be with you.”"
Genesis 31:4,"Jacob had Rachel and Leah called to the field, where his flock was,"
Genesis 31:5,"and said to them, “I see that your father’s manner toward me is not as it has been in the past. But the God of my father’s [house] has been with me."
Genesis 31:6,"As you know, I have served your father with all my might;"
Genesis 31:7,"but your father has cheated me, changing my wages time and again.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>time and again </b>Lit. “ten times.”</i> God, however, would not let him do me harm."
Genesis 31:8,"If he said thus, ‘The speckled shall be your wages,’ then all the flocks would drop speckled young; and if he said thus, ‘The streaked shall be your wages,’ then all the flocks would drop streaked young."
Genesis 31:9,God has taken away your father’s livestock and given it to me.
Genesis 31:10,"“Once, at the mating time of the flocks, I had a dream in which I saw<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>I had a dream in which I saw </b>Lit. “I raised my eyes and saw in a dream, behold.”</i> that the he-goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled, and mottled."
Genesis 31:11,"And in the dream a messenger of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ ‘Here,’ I answered."
Genesis 31:12,"And the messenger said, ‘Note well that all the he-goats which are mating with the flock are streaked, speckled, and mottled; for I have noted all that Laban has been doing to you."
Genesis 31:13,"I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to Me. Now, arise and leave this land and return to your native land.’”"
Genesis 31:14,"Then Rachel and Leah answered him, saying, “Have we still a share in the inheritance of our father’s house?"
Genesis 31:15,"Surely, he regards us as outsiders, now that he has sold us and has used up our purchase price."
Genesis 31:16,"Truly, all the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. Now then, do just as God has told you.”"
Genesis 31:17,Thereupon Jacob put his children and wives on camels;
Genesis 31:18,"and he drove off all his livestock and all the wealth that he had amassed, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan."
Genesis 31:19,"Meanwhile Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father’s household idols."
Genesis 31:20,"Jacob kept Laban the Aramean in the dark,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>kept Laban the Aramean in the dark </b>Lit. “stole the mind of Laban the Aramean”; similarly in v. 26.</i> not telling him that he was fleeing,"
Genesis 31:21,and fled with all that he had. Soon he was across the Euphrates and heading toward the hill country of Gilead.
Genesis 31:22,"On the third day, Laban was told that Jacob had fled."
Genesis 31:23,"So he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him a distance of seven days, catching up with him in the hill country of Gilead."
Genesis 31:24,"But God appeared to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night and said to him, “Beware of attempting anything with Jacob, good or bad.”"
Genesis 31:25,"Laban overtook Jacob. Jacob had pitched his tent on the Height, and Laban with his kinsmen encamped in the hill country of Gilead."
Genesis 31:26,"And Laban said to Jacob, “What did you mean by keeping me in the dark and carrying off my daughters like captives of the sword?"
Genesis 31:27,"Why did you flee in secrecy and mislead me and not tell me? I would have sent you off with festive music, with timbrel and lyre."
Genesis 31:28,"You did not even let me kiss my sons and daughters<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>sons and daughters </b>So NJPS; Heb. levanai we-livnotai, a stock phrase (see, e.g., 46.15; 1 Sam. 30.6; Neh. 5.5) that means “progeny,” thus including grandchildren.</i> good-by! It was a foolish thing for you to do."
Genesis 31:29,"I have it in my power to do you harm; but the God of your father’s [house] said to me last night, ‘Beware of attempting anything with Jacob, good or bad.’"
Genesis 31:30,"Very well, you had to leave because you were longing for your father’s house; but why did you steal my gods?”"
Genesis 31:31,"Jacob answered Laban, saying, “I was afraid because I thought you would take your daughters from me by force."
Genesis 31:32,"But anyone with whom you find your gods shall not remain alive! In the presence of our kin, point out what I have of yours and take it.” Jacob, of course, did not know that Rachel had stolen them."
Genesis 31:33,"So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and Leah’s tent and the tents of the two maidservants; but he did not find them. Leaving Leah’s tent, he entered Rachel’s tent."
Genesis 31:34,"Rachel, meanwhile, had taken the idols and placed them in the camel cushion and sat on them; and Laban rummaged through the tent without finding them."
Genesis 31:35,"For she said to her father, “Let not my lord take it amiss that I cannot rise before you, for I am in a womanly way.” Thus he searched, but could not find the household idols."
Genesis 31:36,"Now Jacob became incensed and took up his grievance with Laban. Jacob spoke up and said to Laban, “What is my crime, what is my guilt that you should pursue me?"
Genesis 31:37,"You rummaged through all my things; what have you found of all your household objects? Set it here, before my kin and yours, and let them decide between us two."
Genesis 31:38,"“These twenty years I have spent in your service, your ewes and she-goats never miscarried, nor did I feast on rams from your flock."
Genesis 31:39,"That which was torn by beasts I never brought to you; I myself made good the loss; you exacted it of me, whether snatched by day or snatched by night."
Genesis 31:40,"Often,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Often </b>Lit. “I was.”</i> scorching heat ravaged me by day and frost by night; and sleep fled from my eyes."
Genesis 31:41,"Of the twenty years that I spent in your household, I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flocks; and you changed my wages time and again.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>time and again </b>Lit. “ten times.”</i> "
Genesis 31:42,"Had not the God of my father’s [house]—the God of Abraham and the Fear<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Fear </b>Meaning of Heb. paḥad uncertain.</i> of Isaac—been with me, you would have sent me away empty-handed. But it was my plight and the toil of my hands that God took notice of—and gave judgment on last night.”"
Genesis 31:43,"Then Laban spoke up and said to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks; all that you see is mine. Yet what can I do now about my daughters or the children they have borne?"
Genesis 31:44,"Come, then, let us make a pact, you and I, that there may be a witness between you and me.”"
Genesis 31:45,Thereupon Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
Genesis 31:46,"And Jacob said to his kinsmen, “Gather stones.” So they took stones and made a mound; and they partook of a meal there by the mound."
Genesis 31:47,"Laban named it Yegar-sahadutha,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Yegar-sahadutha </b>Aramaic for “the mound (or: stone-heap) of witness.”</i> but Jacob named it Gal-ed.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Gal-ed </b>Heb. for “the mound (or: stone-heap) of witness,” reflecting the name Gilead, v. 23.</i> "
Genesis 31:48,"And Laban declared, “This mound is a witness between you and me this day.” That is why it was named Gal-ed;"
Genesis 31:49,"and [it was called] Mizpah, because he said, “May יהוה watch<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>watch </b>Heb. yiṣeph, associated with Mizpah.</i> between you and me, when we are out of sight of each other."
Genesis 31:50,"If you ill-treat my daughters or take other wives besides my daughters—though no one else<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>one else </b>Or “participant,” i.e., one of the witnesses to this agreement, who is thereby authorized to intervene if it is violated; cf. Kimhi, and see the Dictionary under ’ish.</i> be about, remember, it is God who will be witness between you and me.”"
Genesis 31:51,"And Laban said to Jacob, “Here is this mound and here the pillar which I have set up between you and me:"
Genesis 31:52,"this mound shall be witness and this pillar shall be witness that I am not to cross to you past this mound, and that you are not to cross to me past this mound and this pillar, with hostile intent."
Genesis 31:53,"May the God of Abraham’s [house] and the god of Nahor’s [house]”—their ancestral deities—“judge between us.” And Jacob swore by the Fear<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Fear </b>Meaning of Heb. paḥad uncertain.</i> of his father Isaac’s [house]."
Genesis 31:54,"Jacob then offered up a sacrifice on the Height, and invited his kinsmen to partake of the meal. After the meal, they spent the night on the Height."
Genesis 32:1,"Early in the morning, Laban kissed his sons and daughters<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>sons and daughters </b>See note at 31.28.</i> and bade them good-by; then Laban left on his journey homeward."
Genesis 32:2,"Jacob went on his way, and messengers of God encountered him."
Genesis 32:3,"When he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s camp.” So he named that place Mahanaim.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Mahanaim </b>Connected with Heb. maḥaneh “camp.”</i> "
Genesis 32:4,"Jacob sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom,"
Genesis 32:5,"and instructed them as follows, “Thus shall you say, ‘To my lord Esau, thus says your servant Jacob:<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Thus shall you say, ‘To my lord Esau, thus says your servant Jacob…’ </b>Or “Thus you shall say to my lord Esau, ‘Thus says your servant Jacob…’”</i> I stayed with Laban and remained until now;"
Genesis 32:6,"I have acquired cattle, asses, sheep, and male and female slaves; and I send this message to my lord in the hope of gaining your favor.’”"
Genesis 32:7,"The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau; he himself is coming to meet you, and his retinue<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>retinue </b>Trad. “men,” yet women may be in view.

Genesis 32:8,"Jacob was greatly frightened; in his anxiety, he divided the people with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps,"
Genesis 32:9,"thinking, “If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, the other camp may yet escape.”"
Genesis 32:10,"Then Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham’s [house] and God of my father Isaac’s [house], O יהוה, who said to me, ‘Return to your native land and I will deal bountifully with you’!"
Genesis 32:11,"I am unworthy of all the kindness that You have so steadfastly shown Your servant: with my staff alone I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps."
Genesis 32:12,"Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; else, I fear, he may come and strike me down, mothers and children alike."
Genesis 32:13,"Yet You have said, ‘I will deal bountifully with you and make your offspring as the sands of the sea, which are too numerous to count.’”"
Genesis 32:14,"After spending the night there, he selected from what was at hand these presents for his brother Esau:"
Genesis 32:15,200 she-goats and 20 he-goats; 200 ewes and 20 rams;
Genesis 32:16,30 milch camels with their colts; 40 cows and 10 bulls; 20 she-asses and 10 he-asses.
Genesis 32:17,"These he put in the charge of his servants, drove by drove, and he told his servants, “Go on ahead, and keep a distance between droves.”"
Genesis 32:18,"He instructed the one in front as follows, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, ‘Who’s your master? Where are you going? And whose [animals] are these ahead of you?’"
Genesis 32:19,"you shall answer, ‘Your servant Jacob’s; they are a gift sent to my lord Esau; and [Jacob] himself is right behind us.’”"
Genesis 32:20,"He gave similar instructions to the second one, and the third, and all the others who followed the droves, namely, “Thus and so shall you say to Esau when you reach him."
Genesis 32:21,"And you shall add, ‘And your servant Jacob himself is right behind us.’” For he reasoned, “If I propitiate him with presents in advance, and then face him, perhaps he will show me favor.”"
Genesis 32:22,"And so the gift went on ahead, while he remained in camp that night."
Genesis 32:23,"That same night he arose, and taking his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons,<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>sons </b>NJPS “children”; Heb. yeladim.

Genesis 32:26,"When he saw that he had not prevailed against him, he wrenched Jacob’s hip at its socket, so that the socket of his hip was strained as he wrestled with him."
Genesis 32:27,"Then he said, “Let me go, for dawn is breaking.” But he answered, “I will not let you go, unless you bless me.”"
Genesis 32:28,"Said the other, “What is your name?” He replied, “Jacob.”"
Genesis 32:29,"Said he, “Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>striven </b>Heb. saritha, connected with first part of “Israel.”</i> with beings divine and human,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>beings divine and human </b>Or “God (Elohim, connected with second part of ‘Israel’) and human beings.”</i> and have prevailed.”"
Genesis 32:30,"Jacob asked, “Pray tell me your name.” But he said, “You must not ask my name!” And he took leave of him there."
Genesis 32:31,"So Jacob named the place Peniel,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Peniel </b>Understood as “face of God.”</i> meaning, “I have seen a divine being face to face, yet my life has been preserved.”"
Genesis 32:32,"The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping on his hip."
Genesis 32:33,"That is why the children of Israel to this day do not eat the thigh muscle that is on the socket of the hip, since Jacob’s hip socket was wrenched at the thigh muscle."
Genesis 33:1,"Looking up, Jacob saw Esau coming, with a retinue<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>retinue </b>See note at 32.7.</i> of four hundred.

Genesis 33:2,"putting the maids and their children first, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last."
Genesis 33:3,He himself went on ahead and bowed low to the ground seven times until he was near his brother.
Genesis 33:4,"Esau ran to greet him. He embraced him and, falling on his neck, he kissed him; and they wept."
Genesis 33:5,"Looking about, he saw the women and the children. “Who,” he asked, “are these with you?” He answered, “The children with whom God has favored your servant.”"
Genesis 33:6,"Then the maids, with their children, came forward and bowed low;"
Genesis 33:7,"next Leah, with her children, came forward and bowed low; and last, Joseph and Rachel came forward and bowed low."
Genesis 33:8,"And he asked, “What do you mean by all this company which I have met?” He answered, “To gain my lord’s favor.”"
Genesis 33:9,"Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; let what you have remain yours.”"
Genesis 33:10,"But Jacob said, “No, I pray you; if you would do me this favor, accept from me this gift; for to see your face is like seeing the face of God, and you have received me favorably."
Genesis 33:11,"Please accept my present which has been brought to you, for God has favored me and I have plenty.” And when he urged him, he accepted."
Genesis 33:12,"And [Esau] said, “Let us start on our journey, and I will proceed at your pace.”"
Genesis 33:13,"But he said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds, which are nursing, are a care to me; if they are driven hard a single day, all the flocks will die."
Genesis 33:14,"Let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I travel slowly, at the pace of the cattle before me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”"
Genesis 33:15,"Then Esau said, “Let me assign to you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “Oh no, my lord is too kind to me!”"
Genesis 33:16,So Esau started back that day on his way to Seir.
Genesis 33:17,"But Jacob journeyed on to Succoth, and built a house for himself and made stalls for his cattle; that is why the place was called Succoth.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Succoth </b>Meaning “stalls,” “huts,” “booths.”</i> "
Genesis 33:18,Jacob arrived safe in the city of Shechem which is in the land of Canaan—having come thus from Paddan-aram—and he encamped before the city.
Genesis 33:19,"The parcel of land where he pitched his tent he purchased from the kin of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred kesitah s.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>kesitahs </b>Heb. qesiṭah, a unit of unknown value.</i> "

Genesis 34:1,"Now Dinah, the daughter whom Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land."

Genesis 34:3,"Being strongly drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob, and in love with the maiden, he spoke to the maiden tenderly."
Genesis 34:4,"So Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as a wife.”"
Genesis 34:5,"Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah; but since his sons were in the field with his cattle, Jacob kept silent until they came home."
Genesis 34:6,Then Shechem’s father Hamor came out to Jacob to speak to him.
Genesis 34:7,"Meanwhile Jacob’s sons, having heard the news, came in from the field. The men<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>The men </b>More precisely, “the [salient] participants [in the situation],” namely Jacob’s sons.

Genesis 34:8,"And Hamor spoke with them, saying, “My son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him in marriage."
Genesis 34:9,"Intermarry with us: give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves:"
Genesis 34:10,"You will dwell among us, and the land will be open before you; settle, move about, and acquire holdings in it.”"
Genesis 34:11,"Then Shechem said to her father and brothers, “Do me this favor, and I will pay whatever you tell me."
Genesis 34:12,"Ask of me a bride-price ever so high, as well as gifts, and I will pay what you tell me; only give me the maiden for a wife.”"
Genesis 34:13,Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor—speaking with guile because he had defiled their sister Dinah—
Genesis 34:14,"and said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for that is a disgrace among us."
Genesis 34:15,Only on this condition will we agree with you; that you will become like us in that every male among you is circumcised.
Genesis 34:16,Then we will give our daughters to you and take your daughters to ourselves; and we will dwell among you and become as one kindred.
Genesis 34:17,"But if you will not listen to us and become circumcised, we will take our daughter and go.”"
Genesis 34:18,Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor’s son Shechem.
Genesis 34:19,"And the youth lost no time in doing the thing, for he wanted Jacob’s daughter. Now he was the most respected in his father’s house."
Genesis 34:20,"So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the public place<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>public place </b>Lit. “gate.”</i> of their town and spoke to their town council,<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>their town council </b>Heb. ’anshe ‘iram; NJPS “their fellow townsmen,” trad. “the men of their city.” Cf.

Genesis 34:25,"On the third day, when they were in pain, Simeon and Levi, two of Jacob’s sons, brothers of Dinah, took each his sword, came upon the city unmolested, and slew all the males."
Genesis 34:26,"They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword, took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away."
Genesis 34:27,"The other sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the town, because their sister had been defiled."
Genesis 34:28,"They seized their flocks and herds and asses, all that was inside the town and outside;"
Genesis 34:29,"all their wealth, all their children, and their wives, all that was in the houses, they took as captives and booty."
Genesis 34:30,"Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me, making me odious among the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites; my fighters<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>fighters </b>Heb. metim (in construct form); cf.

Genesis 35:4,"They gave to Jacob all the alien gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the terebinth that was near Shechem."
Genesis 35:5,"As they set out, a terror from God fell on the cities round about, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob."
Genesis 35:6,"Thus Jacob came to Luz—that is, Bethel—in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him."
Genesis 35:7,"There he built an altar and named the site El-bethel,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>El-bethel </b>“The God of Bethel.”</i> for it was there that God had been revealed to him when he was fleeing from his brother."

Genesis 35:14,"and Jacob set up a pillar at the site where [God] had spoken to him, a pillar of stone, and he offered a libation on it and poured oil upon it."
Genesis 35:15,"Jacob gave the site, where God had spoken to him, the name of Bethel."
Genesis 35:16,"They set out from Bethel; but when they were still some distance short of Ephrath, Rachel was in childbirth, and she had hard labor."
Genesis 35:17,"When her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, “Have no fear, for it is another boy for you.”"

Genesis 36:6,"Esau took his wives, his sons and daughters, and all the members of his household, his cattle and all his livestock, and all the property that he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to another land because of his brother Jacob."
Genesis 36:7,"For their possessions were too many for them to dwell together, and the land where they sojourned could not support them because of their livestock."
Genesis 36:8,So Esau settled in the hill country of Seir—Esau being Edom.

Genesis 37:4,"And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of his brothers, they hated him so that they could not speak a friendly word to him."
Genesis 37:5,Once Joseph had a dream which he told to his brothers; and they hated him even more.
Genesis 37:6,"He said to them, “Hear this dream which I have dreamed:"
Genesis 37:7,"There we were binding sheaves in the field, when suddenly my sheaf stood up and remained upright; then your sheaves gathered around and bowed low to my sheaf.”"
Genesis 37:8,"His brothers answered, “Do you mean to reign over us? Do you mean to rule over us?” And they hated him even more for his talk about his dreams."

Genesis 37:19,"They said to one another, “Here comes that dreamer!"

Genesis 37:26,"Then Judah said to his brothers, “What do we gain by killing our brother and covering up his blood?"

Genesis 38:1,About that time Judah left his brothers and camped near a certain Adullamite whose name was Hirah.

Genesis 38:3,"She conceived and bore a son, and he named him Er."
Genesis 38:4,"She conceived again and bore a son, and named him Onan."
Genesis 38:5,"Once again she bore a son, and named him Shelah; he was at Chezib when she bore him."
Genesis 38:6,Judah got a wife for Er his first-born; her name was Tamar.
Genesis 38:7,"But Er, Judah’s first-born, was displeasing to יהוה, and יהוה took his life."
Genesis 38:8,"Then Judah said to Onan, “Join with your brother’s wife and do your duty<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>duty </b>Cf. Deut. 25.5.</i> by her as a brother-in-law, and provide offspring for your brother.”"

Genesis 38:10,"What he did was displeasing to יהוה, who took his life also."
Genesis 38:11,"Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Stay as a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up”—for he thought, “He too might die like his brothers.” So Tamar went to live in her father’s house."

When his period of mourning was over,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>his period of mourning was over </b>Lit. “he was comforted.”</i> Judah went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, together with his friend Hirah the Adullamite."

Genesis 38:14,"So she took off her widow’s garb, covered her face with a veil, and, wrapping herself up, sat down at the entrance to Enaim,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Enaim </b>Cf.

Genesis 38:15,"When Judah saw her, he took her for a harlot; for she had covered her face."
Genesis 38:16,"So he turned aside to her by the road and said, “Here, let me sleep with you”—for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. “What,” she asked, “will you pay for sleeping with me?”"
Genesis 38:17,"He replied, “I will send a kid from my flock.” But she said, “You must leave a pledge until you have sent it.”"
Genesis 38:18,"And he said, “What pledge shall I give you?” She replied, “Your seal and cord, and the staff which you carry.” So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she conceived by him."
Genesis 38:19,Then she went on her way. She took off her veil and again put on her widow’s garb.

Genesis 38:27,"When the time came for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb!"
Genesis 38:28,"While she was in labor, one of them put out a hand, and the midwife tied a crimson thread on that hand, to signify: This one came out first."

Genesis 39:4,"he took a liking to Joseph. He made him his personal attendant and put him in charge of his household, placing in his hands all that he owned."
Genesis 39:5,"And from the time that the Egyptian put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, יהוה blessed his house for Joseph’s sake, so that the blessing of יהוה was upon everything that he owned, in the house and outside."
Genesis 39:6,"He left all that he had in Joseph’s hands and, with him there, he paid attention to nothing save the food that he ate. Now Joseph was well built and handsome."
Genesis 39:7,"After a time, his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and said, “Lie with me.”"
Genesis 39:8,"But he refused. He said to his master’s wife, “Look, with me here, my master gives no thought to anything in this house, and all that he owns he has placed in my hands."
Genesis 39:9,"He wields no more authority in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except yourself, since you are his wife. How then could I do this most wicked thing, and sin before God?”"
Genesis 39:10,"And much as she coaxed Joseph day after day, he did not yield to her request to lie beside her, to be with her."
Genesis 39:11,"One such day, he came into the house to do his work. None of the household being there inside,"
Genesis 39:12,"she caught hold of him by his garment and said, “Lie with me!” But he left his garment in her hand and got away and fled outside."
Genesis 39:13,"When she saw that he had left it in her hand and had fled outside,"
Genesis 39:14,"she called out to her servants and said to them, “Look, he had to bring us a Hebrew to dally with us! This one came to lie with me; but I screamed loud."

Genesis 39:16,"She kept his garment beside her, until his master came home."
Genesis 39:17,"Then she told him the same story, saying, “The Hebrew slave whom you brought into our house came to me to dally with me;"

Genesis 39:19,"When his master heard the story that his wife told him, namely, “Thus and so your slave did to me,” he was furious."
Genesis 39:20,"So Joseph’s master had him put in prison, where the king’s prisoners were confined. But even while he was there in prison,"
Genesis 39:21,יהוה was with Joseph—extending kindness to him and disposing the chief jailer favorably toward him.

Genesis 39:23,"The chief jailer did not supervise anything that was in Joseph’s<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Joseph’s </b>Lit. “his.”</i> charge, because יהוה was with him, and whatever he did יהוה made successful."
Genesis 40:1,"Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt gave offense to their lord the king of Egypt."
Genesis 40:2,"Pharaoh was angry with his two courtiers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,"
Genesis 40:3,"and put them in custody, in the house of the prefect,<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>prefect </b>See note at 37.36.</i> in the same prison house where Joseph was confined."
Genesis 40:4,"The prefect assigned Joseph to them, and he attended them. When they had been in custody for some time,"
Genesis 40:5,"both of them—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison—dreamed in the same night, each his own dream and each dream with its own meaning."
Genesis 40:6,"When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were distraught."
Genesis 40:7,"He asked Pharaoh’s courtiers, who were with him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why do you appear downcast today?”"
Genesis 40:8,"And they said to him, “We had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.” So Joseph said to them, “Surely God can interpret! Tell me [your dreams].”"
Genesis 40:9,"Then the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph. He said to him, “In my dream, there was a vine in front of me."
Genesis 40:10,"On the vine were three branches. It had barely budded, when out came its blossoms and its clusters ripened into grapes."
Genesis 40:11,"Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”"
Genesis 40:12,"Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: The three branches are three days."
Genesis 40:13,"In three days Pharaoh will pardon you<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>pardon you </b>Lit. “lift up your head.” Cf. below at vv. 19, 20.</i> and restore you to your post; you will place Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, as was your custom formerly when you were his cupbearer."
Genesis 40:14,"But think of me when all is well with you again, and do me the kindness of mentioning me to Pharaoh, so as to free me from this place."
Genesis 40:15,"For in truth, I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews; nor have I done anything here that they should have put me in the dungeon.”"
Genesis 40:16,"When the chief baker saw how favorably he had interpreted, he said to Joseph, “In my dream, similarly, there were three openwork baskets<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>openwork baskets </b>Others “baskets with white bread” or “white baskets”; meaning of Heb. ḥori uncertain.</i> on my head."
Genesis 40:17,In the uppermost basket were all kinds of food for Pharaoh that a baker prepares; and the birds were eating it out of the basket above my head.”
Genesis 40:18,"Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation: The three baskets are three days."
Genesis 40:19,"In three days Pharaoh will lift off your head<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>lift off your head </b>Lit. “lift up your head.” Cf. at vv. 13, 20.</i> and impale you upon a pole; and the birds will pick off your flesh.”"

Genesis 40:21,"He restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearing, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand;"
Genesis 40:22,but the chief baker he impaled—just as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Genesis 40:23,Yet the chief cupbearer did not think of Joseph; he forgot him.
Genesis 41:1,"After two years’ time, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile,"
Genesis 41:2,"when out of the Nile there came up seven cows, handsome and sturdy, and they grazed in the reed grass."
Genesis 41:3,"But presently, seven other cows came up from the Nile close behind them, ugly and gaunt, and stood beside the cows on the bank of the Nile;"
Genesis 41:4,and the ugly gaunt cows ate up the seven handsome sturdy cows. And Pharaoh awoke.
Genesis 41:5,"He fell asleep and dreamed a second time: Seven ears of grain, solid and healthy, grew on a single stalk."
Genesis 41:6,"But close behind them sprouted seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind."
Genesis 41:7,And the thin ears swallowed up the seven solid and full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke: it was a dream!
Genesis 41:8,"Next morning, his spirit was agitated, and he sent for all the magician-priests of Egypt, and all its sages; and Pharaoh told them his dreams, but none could interpret them for Pharaoh."
Genesis 41:9,"The chief cupbearer then spoke up and said to Pharaoh, “I must make mention today of my offenses."

Genesis 41:12,"A Hebrew youth was there with us, a servant of the prefect; and when we told him our dreams, he interpreted them for us, telling each of the meaning of his dream."
Genesis 41:13,"And as he interpreted for us, so it came to pass: I was restored to my post, and the other was impaled.”"
Genesis 41:14,"Thereupon Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was rushed from the dungeon. He had his hair cut and changed his clothes, and he appeared before Pharaoh."
Genesis 41:15,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, but no one can interpret it. Now I have heard it said of you that for you to hear a dream is to tell its meaning.”"
Genesis 41:16,"Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “Not I! God will see to Pharaoh’s welfare.”"
Genesis 41:17,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream, I was standing on the bank of the Nile,"
Genesis 41:18,when out of the Nile came up seven sturdy and well-formed cows and grazed in the reed grass.
Genesis 41:19,"Presently there followed them seven other cows, scrawny, ill-formed, and emaciated—never had I seen their likes for ugliness in all the land of Egypt!"
Genesis 41:20,"And the seven lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven cows, the sturdy ones;"
Genesis 41:21,"but when they had consumed them, one could not tell that they had consumed them, for they looked just as bad as before. And I awoke."
Genesis 41:22,"In my other dream, I saw seven ears of grain, full and healthy, growing on a single stalk;"
Genesis 41:23,"but right behind them sprouted seven ears, shriveled, thin, and scorched by the east wind."
Genesis 41:24,"And the thin ears swallowed the seven healthy ears. I have told my magician-priests, but none has an explanation for me.”"
Genesis 41:25,"And Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s dreams are one and the same: Pharaoh has been told what God is about to do."
Genesis 41:26,"The seven healthy cows are seven years, and the seven healthy ears are seven years; it is the same dream."
Genesis 41:27,"The seven lean and ugly cows that followed are seven years, as are also the seven empty ears scorched by the east wind; they are seven years of famine."
Genesis 41:28,It is just as I have told Pharaoh: Pharaoh has been shown what God is about to do.
Genesis 41:29,Immediately ahead are seven years of great abundance in all the land of Egypt.
Genesis 41:30,"After them will come seven years of famine, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten. As the land is ravaged by famine,"
Genesis 41:31,"no trace of the abundance will be left in the land because of the famine thereafter, for it will be very severe."
Genesis 41:32,"As for Pharaoh having had the same dream twice, it means that the matter has been determined by God, and that God will soon carry it out."
Genesis 41:33,"“Accordingly, let Pharaoh find someone<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>someone </b>Lit. “a participant whose involvement defines the (proposed) situation.” See the Dictionary under ’ish.</i> who’s discerning and wise, whom you can set over the land of Egypt."
Genesis 41:34,"And let Pharaoh take steps to appoint overseers over the land, and organize<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>organize </b>Others “take a fifth part of”; meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> the land of Egypt in the seven years of plenty."
Genesis 41:35,"Let all the food of these good years that are coming be gathered, and let the grain be collected under Pharaoh’s authority as food to be stored in the cities."
Genesis 41:36,"Let that food be a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which will come upon the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish in the famine.”"
Genesis 41:37,The plan pleased Pharaoh and all his courtiers.
Genesis 41:38,"And Pharaoh said to his courtiers, “Could we find another like him—a man with the divine spirit?”"
Genesis 41:39,"So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is none so discerning and wise as you."
Genesis 41:40,"You shall be in charge of my court, and by your command shall all my people be directed;<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>be directed </b>Others “order themselves” or “pay homage”; meaning of Heb. yishshaq uncertain.</i> only with respect to the throne shall I be superior to you.”"
Genesis 41:41,"Pharaoh further said to Joseph, “See, I put you in charge of all the land of Egypt.”"
Genesis 41:42,"And removing his signet ring from his hand, Pharaoh put it on Joseph’s hand; and he had him dressed in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck."
Genesis 41:43,"He had him ride in the chariot of his second-in-command, and they cried before him, “Abrek!”<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Abrek </b>Others “Bow the knee,” as though from Heb. barakh “to kneel”; perhaps from an Egyptian word of unknown meaning.</i> Thus he placed him over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis 41:44,"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh; yet without you, no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.”"
Genesis 41:45,"Pharaoh then gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah;<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Zaphenath-paneah </b>Egyptian for “God speaks; he lives,” or “creator of life.”</i> and he gave him for a wife Asenath daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On. Thus Joseph emerged in charge of the land of Egypt.—"
Genesis 41:46,"Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt.—Leaving Pharaoh’s presence, Joseph traveled through all the land of Egypt."
Genesis 41:47,"During the seven years of plenty, the land produced in abundance."
Genesis 41:48,"And he gathered all the grain of the seven years that the land of Egypt was enjoying,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>the seven years that the land of Egypt was enjoying </b>Lit. “the seven years that were in the land of Egypt.”</i> and stored the grain in the cities; he put in each city the grain of the fields around it."
Genesis 41:49,"So Joseph collected produce in very large quantity, like the sands of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured."
Genesis 41:50,"Before the years of famine came, Joseph became the father of two sons, whom Asenath daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On, bore to him."
Genesis 41:51,"Joseph named the first-born Manasseh, meaning, “God has made me forget<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>has made me forget </b>Heb. nashshani, connected with “Manasseh” (Menashsheh).</i> completely my hardship and my parental home.”"
Genesis 41:52,"And the second he named Ephraim, meaning, “God has made me fertile<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>has made me fertile </b>Heb. hiphrani, connected with “Ephraim.”</i> in the land of my affliction.”"
Genesis 41:53,"The seven years of abundance that the land of Egypt enjoyed came to an end,"
Genesis 41:54,"and the seven years of famine set in, just as Joseph had foretold. There was famine in all lands, but throughout the land of Egypt there was bread."
Genesis 41:55,"And when all the land of Egypt felt the hunger, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; whatever he tells you, you shall do.”—"
Genesis 41:56,"Accordingly, when the famine became severe in the land of Egypt, Joseph laid open all that was within, and rationed out grain to the Egyptians. The famine, however, spread over the whole world."
Genesis 41:57,"So all the world came to Joseph in Egypt to procure rations, for the famine had become severe throughout the world."
Genesis 42:1,"When Jacob saw that there were food rations to be had in Egypt, he<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>he </b>Lit. “Jacob.”</i> said to his sons, “Why do you keep looking at one another?"
Genesis 42:2,"Now I hear,” he went on, “that there are rations to be had in Egypt. Go down and procure rations for us there, that we may live and not die.”"
Genesis 42:3,So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to get grain rations in Egypt;
Genesis 42:4,"for Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, since he feared that he might meet with disaster."
Genesis 42:5,"Thus the sons of Israel were among those who came to procure rations, for the famine extended to the land of Canaan."
Genesis 42:6,"Now Joseph was the vizier of the land; it was he who dispensed rations to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brothers came and bowed low to him, with their faces to the ground."
Genesis 42:7,"When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them; but he acted like a stranger toward them and spoke harshly to them. He asked them, “Where do you come from?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan, to procure food.”"
Genesis 42:8,"For though Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him."
Genesis 42:9,"Recalling the dreams that he had dreamed about them, Joseph said to them, “You are spies, you have come to see the land in its nakedness.”"
Genesis 42:10,"But they said to him, “No, my lord! Truly, your servants have come to procure food."
Genesis 42:11,We are all of us sons of the same man; we are being honest; your servants have never been spies!”
Genesis 42:12,"And he said to them, “No, you have come to see the land in its nakedness!”"
Genesis 42:13,"And they replied, “We your servants were twelve brothers, sons of a certain man in the land of Canaan; the youngest, however, is now with our father, and one is no more.”"
Genesis 42:14,"But Joseph said to them, “It is just as I have told you: You are spies!"
Genesis 42:15,"By this you shall be put to the test: unless your youngest brother comes here, by Pharaoh, you shall not depart from this place!"
Genesis 42:16,"Let one of you go and bring your brother, while the rest of you remain confined, that your words may be put to the test whether there is truth in you. Else, by Pharaoh, you are nothing but spies!”"
Genesis 42:17,And he confined them in the guardhouse for three days.
Genesis 42:18,"On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do this and you shall live, for I fear God."
Genesis 42:19,"If you are being honest, let one of you brothers be held in your place of detention, while the rest of you go and take home rations for your starving households;"
Genesis 42:20,"but you must bring me your youngest brother, that your words may be verified and that you may not die.” And they did accordingly."
Genesis 42:21,"They said to one another, “Alas, we are being punished on account of our brother, because we looked on at his anguish, yet paid no heed as he pleaded with us. That is why this distress has come upon us.”"
Genesis 42:22,"Then Reuben spoke up and said to them, “Did I not tell you, ‘Do no wrong to the boy’? But you paid no heed. Now comes the reckoning for his blood.”"
Genesis 42:23,"They did not know that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between him and them."
Genesis 42:24,He turned away from them and wept. But he came back to them and spoke to them; and he took Simeon from among them and had him bound before their eyes.
Genesis 42:25,"Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, return each one’s money to his sack, and give them provisions for the journey; and this was done for them."
Genesis 42:26,So they loaded their asses with the rations and departed from there.
Genesis 42:27,"As one of them was opening his sack to give feed to his ass at the night encampment, he saw his money right there at the mouth of his bag."
Genesis 42:28,"And he said to his brothers, “My money has been returned! It is here in my bag!” Their hearts sank; and, trembling, they turned to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”"
Genesis 42:29,"When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had befallen them, saying,"
Genesis 42:30,"“The man<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>The man </b>More precisely, “the participant [whose involvement defines the depicted situation].” See the Dictionary under ’ish.</i> who is lord of the land spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying on the land."
Genesis 42:31,"We said to him, ‘We are being honest; we have never been spies!"
Genesis 42:32,"There were twelve of us brothers, sons by the same father; but one is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.’"
Genesis 42:33,"But the man—who is lord of the land—said to us, ‘By this I shall know that you are being honest: leave one of your brothers with me, and take something for your starving households and be off."
Genesis 42:34,"And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know that you are not spies, that you are being honest. I will then restore your brother to you, and you shall be free to move about in the land.’”"
Genesis 42:35,"As they were emptying their sacks, there, in each one’s sack, was his money-bag! When they and their father saw their money-bags, they were dismayed."
Genesis 42:36,"Their father Jacob said to them, “It is always me that you bereave: Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you would take away Benjamin. These things always happen to me!”"
Genesis 42:37,"Then Reuben said to his father, “You may kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my care, and I will return him to you.”"
Genesis 42:38,"But he said, “My son must not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he alone is left. If he meets with disaster on the journey you are taking, you will send my white head down to Sheol in grief.”"
Genesis 43:1,But the famine in the land was severe.
Genesis 43:2,"And when they had eaten up the rations which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again and procure some food for us.”"
Genesis 43:3,"But Judah said to him, “The man<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">See note at 42.30.</i> warned us, ‘Do not let me see your faces<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Do not let me see your faces </b>Lit. “Do not see my face.”</i> unless your brother is with you.’"
Genesis 43:4,"If you will let our brother go with us, we will go down and procure food for you;"
Genesis 43:5,"but if you will not let him go, we will not go down, for that man said to us, ‘Do not let me see your faces<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Do not let me see your faces </b>See note at v. 3.</i> unless your brother is with you.’”"
Genesis 43:6,"And Israel said, “Why did you serve me so ill as to tell the man that you had another brother?”"
Genesis 43:7,"They replied, “But the man kept asking about us and our family, saying, ‘Is your father still living? Have you another brother?’ And we answered him accordingly. How were we to know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother here’?”"
Genesis 43:8,"Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy in my care, and let us be on our way, that we may live and not die—you and we and our children."
Genesis 43:9,"I myself will be surety for him; you may hold me responsible: if I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, I shall stand guilty before you forever."
Genesis 43:10,For we could have been there and back twice if we had not dawdled.”
Genesis 43:11,"Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, do this: take some of the choice products of the land in your baggage, and carry them down as a gift for the man—some balm and some honey, gum, ladanum, pistachio nuts, and almonds."
Genesis 43:12,"And take with you double the money, carrying back with you the money that was replaced in the mouths of your bags; perhaps it was a mistake."
Genesis 43:13,Take your brother too; and go back at once to the man.
Genesis 43:14,"And may El Shaddai dispose the man to mercy toward you, that he may release to you your other brother, as well as Benjamin. As for me, if I am to be bereaved, I shall be bereaved.”"
Genesis 43:15,"So the agents<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>agents </b>More precisely, “participants whose involvement defines the depicted situation”—i.e., the sons who have been delegated as their father’s agents. See the Dictionary under ’ish; Agent.</i> took that gift, and they took with them double the money, as well as Benjamin. They made their way down to Egypt, where they presented themselves to Joseph."
Genesis 43:16,"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his house steward, “Take those men<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>those men </b>More precisely, “the [salient] participants.” See the Dictionary under ’ish.</i> into the house; slaughter and prepare an animal, for those men will dine with me at noon.”"
Genesis 43:17,"The man did as Joseph said, and he brought the men into Joseph’s house."
Genesis 43:18,"But the men were frightened at being brought into Joseph’s house. “It must be,” they thought, “because of the money replaced in our bags the first time that we have been brought inside, as a pretext to attack us and seize us as slaves, with our pack animals.”"
Genesis 43:19,So they went up to Joseph’s house steward and spoke to him at the entrance of the house.
Genesis 43:20,"“If you please, my lord,” they said, “we came down once before to procure food."
Genesis 43:21,"But when we arrived at the night encampment and opened our bags, there was each one’s money in the mouth of his bag, our money in full.<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>in full </b>Lit. “by its weight.”</i> So we have brought it back with us."
Genesis 43:22,And we have brought down with us other money to procure food. We do not know who put the money in our bags.”
Genesis 43:23,"He replied, “All is well with you; do not be afraid. Your God, the God of your father’s [house], must have put treasure in your bags for you. I got your payment.” And he brought out Simeon to them."
Genesis 43:24,"Then the steward brought the men into Joseph’s house; he gave them water to bathe their feet, and he provided feed for their asses."
Genesis 43:25,"They laid out their gifts to await Joseph’s arrival at noon, for they had heard that they were to dine there."
Genesis 43:26,"When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts that they had brought with them into the house, bowing low before him to the ground."
Genesis 43:27,"He greeted them, and he said, “How is your aged father of whom you spoke? Is he still in good health?”"
Genesis 43:28,"They replied, “It is well with your servant our father; he is still in good health.” And they bowed and made obeisance."
Genesis 43:29,"Looking about, he saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and asked, “Is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me?” And he went on, “May God be gracious to you, my boy.”"
Genesis 43:30,"With that, Joseph hurried out, for he was overcome with feeling toward his brother and was on the verge of tears; he went into a room and wept there."
Genesis 43:31,"Then he washed his face, reappeared, and—now in control of himself—gave the order, “Serve the meal.”"
Genesis 43:32,"They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; for the Egyptians could not dine with the Hebrews, since that would be abhorrent to the Egyptians."
Genesis 43:33,"As they were seated by his direction, from the oldest in the order of his seniority to the youngest in the order of his youth, the men looked at one another in astonishment."
Genesis 43:34,"Portions were served them from his table; but Benjamin’s portion was several<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>several </b>Lit. “five.”</i> times that of anyone else. And they drank their fill with him."
Genesis 44:1,"Then he instructed his house steward as follows, “Fill the men’s bags with food, as much as they can carry, and put each one’s money in the mouth of his bag."
Genesis 44:2,"Put my silver goblet in the mouth of the bag of the youngest one, together with his money for the rations.” And he did as Joseph told him."
Genesis 44:3,"With the first light of morning, the men were sent off with their pack animals."
Genesis 44:4,"They had just left the city and had not gone far, when Joseph said to his house steward, “Up, go after those men! And when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why did you repay good with evil?"
Genesis 44:5,It is the very one from which my master drinks and which he uses for divination. It was a wicked thing for you to do!’”
Genesis 44:6,He overtook them and spoke those words to them.
Genesis 44:7,"And they said to him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything of the kind!"
Genesis 44:8,Here we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money that we found in the mouths of our bags. How then could we have stolen any silver or gold from your master’s house!
Genesis 44:9,"Whichever of your servants it is found with shall die; the rest of us, moreover, shall become slaves to my lord.”"
Genesis 44:10,"He replied, “Although what you are proposing is right, only the one with whom it is found shall be my slave; but the rest of you shall go free.”"
Genesis 44:11,"So each one hastened to lower his bag to the ground, and each one opened his bag."
Genesis 44:12,"He searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the goblet turned up in Benjamin’s bag."
Genesis 44:13,"At this they rent their clothes. Each reloaded his pack animal, and they returned to the city."
Genesis 44:14,"When Judah and his brothers reentered the house of Joseph, who was still there, they threw themselves on the ground before him."
Genesis 44:15,"Joseph said to them, “What is this deed that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me practices divination?”"
Genesis 44:16,"Judah replied, “What can we say to my lord? How can we plead, how can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered the crime of your servants. Here we are, then, slaves of my lord, the rest of us as much as he in whose possession the goblet was found.”"
Genesis 44:17,"But he replied, “Far be it from me to act thus! Only the one in whose possession the goblet was found shall be my slave; the rest of you go back in peace to your father.”"
Genesis 44:18,"Then Judah went up to him and said, “Please, my lord, let your servant appeal to my lord, and do not be impatient with your servant, you who are the equal of Pharaoh."
Genesis 44:19,"My lord asked his servants, ‘Have you a father or another brother?’"
Genesis 44:20,"We told my lord, ‘We have an old father, and there is a child of his old age, the youngest; his full brother is dead, so that he alone is left of his mother, and his father dotes on him.’"
Genesis 44:21,"Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set eyes on him.’"
Genesis 44:22,"We said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father; if he were to leave him, his father would die.’"
Genesis 44:23,"But you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, do not let me see your faces.’"
Genesis 44:24,"When we came back to your servant my father, we reported my lord’s words to him."
Genesis 44:25,"“Later our father said, ‘Go back and procure some food for us.’"
Genesis 44:26,"We answered, ‘We cannot go down; only if our youngest brother is with us can we go down, for we may not show our faces to the man<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>show our faces to the man </b>Lit. “see the [salient] participant’s face.”</i> unless our youngest brother is with us.’"
Genesis 44:27,"Your servant my father said to us, ‘As you know, my wife bore me two sons."
Genesis 44:28,"But one is gone from me, and I said: Alas, he was torn by a beast! And I have not seen him since."
Genesis 44:29,"If you take this one from me, too, and he meets with disaster, you will send my white head down to Sheol in sorrow.’"
Genesis 44:30,"“Now, if I come to your servant my father and the boy is not with us—since his own life is so bound up with his—"
Genesis 44:31,"when he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will send the white head of your servant our father down to Sheol in grief."
Genesis 44:32,"Now your servant has pledged himself for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, I shall stand guilty before my father forever.’"
Genesis 44:33,"Therefore, please let your servant remain as a slave to my lord instead of the boy, and let the boy go back with his brothers."
Genesis 44:34,For how can I go back to my father unless the boy is with me? Let me not be witness to the woe that would overtake my father!”
Genesis 45:1,"Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, “Have everyone withdraw from me!” So there was no one else about when Joseph made himself known to his brothers."
Genesis 45:2,"His sobs were so loud that the Egyptians could hear, and so the news reached Pharaoh’s palace."
Genesis 45:3,"Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph. Is my father still well?” But his brothers could not answer him, so dumfounded were they on account of him."
Genesis 45:4,"Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come forward to me.” And when they came forward, he said, “I am your brother Joseph, he whom you sold into Egypt."
Genesis 45:5,"Now, do not be distressed or reproach yourselves because you sold me hither; it was to save life that God sent me ahead of you."
Genesis 45:6,"It is now two years that there has been famine in the land, and there are still five years to come in which there shall be no yield from tilling."
Genesis 45:7,"God has sent me ahead of you to ensure your survival on earth, and to save your lives in an extraordinary deliverance."
Genesis 45:8,"So, it was not you who sent me here, but God—who has made me a father to Pharaoh,<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>father to Pharaoh </b>(So trad.) Or “Pharaoh’s chancellor,” cf. Isa. 22.15, 20–21. Heb. ’av le-phar‘oh.</i> lord of all his household, and ruler over the whole land of Egypt."
Genesis 45:9,"“Now, hurry back to my father and say to him: Thus says your son Joseph, ‘God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me without delay."
Genesis 45:10,"You will dwell in the region of Goshen, where you will be near me—you and your children and your grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all that is yours."
Genesis 45:11,There I will provide for you—for there are yet five years of famine to come—that you and your household and all that is yours may not suffer want.’
Genesis 45:12,"You can see for yourselves, and my brother Benjamin for himself, that it is indeed I who am speaking to you."
Genesis 45:13,And you must tell my father everything about my high station in Egypt and all that you have seen; and bring my father here with all speed.”
Genesis 45:14,"With that he embraced<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>embraced </b>Lit. “fell on.”</i> his brother Benjamin around the neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck."
Genesis 45:15,He kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; only then were his brothers able to talk to him.
Genesis 45:16,The news reached Pharaoh’s palace: “Joseph’s brothers have come.” Pharaoh and his courtiers were pleased.
Genesis 45:17,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do as follows: load up your beasts and go at once to the land of Canaan."
Genesis 45:18,Take your father and your households and come to me; I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you shall live off the fat of the land.’
Genesis 45:19,"And you are bidden [to add], ‘Do as follows: take from the land of Egypt wagons for your children and your wives, and bring your father here."
Genesis 45:20,"And never mind your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt shall be yours.’”"
Genesis 45:21,"The sons of Israel did so; Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had commanded, and he supplied them with provisions for the journey."
Genesis 45:22,"To each of them, moreover, he gave a change of clothing; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and several<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>several </b>Lit. “five”; cf. 43.34.</i> changes of clothing."
Genesis 45:23,"And to his father he sent the following: ten he-asses laden with the best things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain, bread, and provisions for his father on the journey."
Genesis 45:24,"As he sent his brothers off on their way, he told them, “Do not be quarrelsome on the way.”"
Genesis 45:25,They went up from Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
Genesis 45:26,"And they told him, “Joseph is still alive; yes, he is ruler over the whole land of Egypt.” His heart went numb, for he did not believe them."
Genesis 45:27,"But when they recounted all that Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to transport him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived."
Genesis 45:28,“Enough!” said Israel. “My son Joseph is still alive! I must go and see him before I die.”
Genesis 46:1,"So Israel set out with all that was his, and he came to Beer-sheba, where he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac’s [house]."
Genesis 46:2,"God called to Israel in a vision by night: “Jacob! Jacob!” He answered, “Here.”"
Genesis 46:3,"“I am God, the God of your father’s [house]. Fear not to go down to Egypt, for I will make you there into a great nation."
Genesis 46:4,"I Myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I Myself will also bring you back; and Joseph’s hand shall close your eyes.”"
Genesis 46:5,So Jacob set out from Beer-sheba. The sons of Israel put their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to transport him;
Genesis 46:6,and they took along their livestock and the wealth that they had amassed in the land of Canaan. Thus Jacob and all his offspring with him came to Egypt:
Genesis 46:7,"he brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons, his daughters<sup>°</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>daughters </b>(So trad.) The plural is part of a standard formula; cf. vv. 15, 23; Num. 26.8; 1 Chron. 2.8.</i> and granddaughters—all his offspring."
Genesis 46:8,"These are the names of the Israelites, Jacob and his descendants, who came to Egypt. Jacob’s first-born Reuben;"
Genesis 46:9,"Reuben’s sons: Enoch,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Enoch </b>Or “Hanoch.”</i> Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi."
Genesis 46:10,"Simeon’s sons: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Saul<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Saul </b>Or “Shaul.”</i> the son of a Canaanite woman."
Genesis 46:11,"Levi’s sons: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."

Genesis 46:30,"Then Israel said to Joseph, “Now I can die, having seen for myself that you are still alive.”"
Genesis 46:31,"Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and tell the news to Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me."
Genesis 46:32,"They happen to be shepherds; they have always been breeders of livestock, and they have brought with them their flocks and herds and all that is theirs.’"

Genesis 46:34,"you shall answer, ‘Your servants have been breeders of livestock from the start until now, both we and our fathers’—so that you may stay in the region of Goshen. For all shepherds are abhorrent to Egyptians.”"
Genesis 47:1,"Then Joseph came and reported to Pharaoh, saying, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all that is theirs, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in the region of Goshen.”"
Genesis 47:2,"And carefully selecting a few<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>a few </b>Lit. “five.”</i> of his brothers, he presented them to Pharaoh."
Genesis 47:3,"Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” They answered Pharaoh, “We your servants are shepherds, as were also our fathers."
Genesis 47:4,"We have come,” they told Pharaoh, “to sojourn in this land, for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks, the famine being severe in the land of Canaan. Pray, then, let your servants stay in the region of Goshen.”"
Genesis 47:5,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “As regards your father and your brothers who have come to you,"
Genesis 47:6,"the land of Egypt is open before you: settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land; let them stay in the region of Goshen.

Genesis 47:10,"Then Jacob bade Pharaoh farewell, and left Pharaoh’s presence."
Genesis 47:11,"So Joseph settled his father and his brothers, giving them holdings in the choicest part of the land of Egypt, in the region of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
Genesis 47:12,"Joseph sustained his father, and his brothers, and all his father’s household with bread, down to the little ones."
Genesis 47:13,"Now there was no bread in all the world, for the famine was very severe; both the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine."
Genesis 47:14,"Joseph gathered in all the money that was to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, as payment for the rations that were being procured, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s palace."
Genesis 47:15,"And when the money gave out in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us bread, lest we die before your very eyes; for the money is gone!”"
Genesis 47:16,"And Joseph said, “Bring your livestock, and I will sell to you against your livestock, if the money is gone.”"
Genesis 47:17,"So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, for the stocks of sheep and cattle, and the asses; thus he provided them with bread that year in exchange for all their livestock."
Genesis 47:18,"And when that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, “We cannot hide from my lord that, with all the money and animal stocks consigned to my lord, nothing is left at my lord’s disposal save our persons and our farmland."
Genesis 47:19,"Let us not perish before your eyes, both we and our land. Take us and our land in exchange for bread, and we with our land will be serfs to Pharaoh; provide the seed, that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become a waste.”"
Genesis 47:20,"So Joseph gained possession of all the farm land of Egypt for Pharaoh, all the Egyptians having sold their fields because the famine was too much for them; thus the land passed over to Pharaoh."
Genesis 47:21,"And he removed the population town by town,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>town by town </b>Meaning of Heb. ’otho le‘arim uncertain.</i> from one end of Egypt’s border to the other."
Genesis 47:22,"Only the land of the priests he did not take over, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they lived off the allotment which Pharaoh had made to them; therefore they did not sell their land."
Genesis 47:23,"Then Joseph said to the people, “Whereas I have this day acquired you and your land for Pharaoh, here is seed for you to sow the land."
Genesis 47:24,"And when harvest comes, you shall give one-fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths shall be yours as seed for the fields and as food for you and those in your households, and as nourishment for your children.”"
Genesis 47:25,"And they said, “You have saved our lives! We are grateful to my lord, and we shall be serfs to Pharaoh.”"
Genesis 47:26,"And Joseph made it into a land law in Egypt, which is still valid, that a fifth should be Pharaoh’s; only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh’s."
Genesis 47:27,"Thus Israel settled in the country of Egypt, in the region of Goshen; they acquired holdings in it, and were fertile and increased greatly."
Genesis 47:28,"Jacob lived seventeen years in the land of Egypt, so that the span of Jacob’s life came to one hundred and forty-seven years."
Genesis 47:29,"And when the time approached for Israel to die, he summoned his son Joseph and said to him, “Do me this favor, place your hand under my thigh as a pledge of your steadfast loyalty: please do not bury me in Egypt."

Genesis 47:31,"And he said, “Swear to me.” And he swore to him. Then Israel bowed at the head of the bed."
Genesis 48:1,"Some time afterward, Joseph was told, “Your father is ill.” So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
Genesis 48:2,"When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to see you,” Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed."
Genesis 48:3,"And Jacob said to Joseph, “El Shaddai, who appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, blessed me—"
Genesis 48:4,"and said to me, ‘I will make you fertile and numerous, making of you a community of peoples; and I will assign this land to your offspring to come for an everlasting possession.’"
Genesis 48:5,"Now, your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, shall be mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine no less than Reuben and Simeon."

Genesis 48:7,"I [do this because], when I was returning from Paddan, Rachel died, to my sorrow, while I was journeying in the land of Canaan, when still some distance short of Ephrath; and I buried her there on the road to Ephrath”—now Bethlehem."
Genesis 48:8,"Noticing Joseph’s sons, Israel asked, “Who are these?”"
Genesis 48:9,"And Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” “Bring them up to me,” he said, “that I may bless them.”"
Genesis 48:10,"Now Israel’s eyes were dim with age; he could not see. So [Joseph] brought them close to him, and he kissed them and embraced them."
Genesis 48:11,"And Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see you again, and here God has let me see your children as well.”"
Genesis 48:12,"Joseph then removed them from his knees, and bowed low with his face to the ground."
Genesis 48:13,"Joseph took the two of them, Ephraim with his right hand—to Israel’s left—and Manasseh with his left hand—to Israel’s right—and brought them close to him."
Genesis 48:14,"But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on Ephraim’s head, though he was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head—thus crossing his hands—although Manasseh was the first-born."
Genesis 48:15,"And he blessed Joseph, saying,<br>“The God in whose ways my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,<br>The God who has been my shepherd from my birth to this day—<br>"
Genesis 48:16,"The Messenger who has redeemed me from all harm—<br>Bless the lads.<br>In them may my name be recalled,<br>And the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac,<br>And may they be teeming multitudes upon the earth.”"
Genesis 48:17,"When Joseph saw that his father was placing his right hand on Ephraim’s head, he thought it wrong; so he took hold of his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s."
Genesis 48:18,"“Not so, Father,” Joseph said to his father, “for the other is the first-born; place your right hand on his head.”"
Genesis 48:19,"But his father objected, saying, “I know, my son, I know. He too shall become a people, and he too shall be great. Yet his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall be plentiful enough for nations.”"
Genesis 48:20,"So he blessed them that day, saying, “By you shall Israel invoke blessings, saying: God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.” Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh."
Genesis 48:21,"Then Israel said to Joseph, “I am about to die; but God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your ancestors."

Genesis 50:1,Joseph flung himself upon his father’s face and wept over him and kissed him.
Genesis 50:2,"Then Joseph ordered the physicians in his service to embalm his father, and the physicians embalmed Israel."
Genesis 50:3,"It required forty days, for such is the full period of embalming. The Egyptians bewailed him seventy days;"
Genesis 50:4,"and when the wailing period was over, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh’s court, saying, “Do me this favor, and lay this appeal before Pharaoh:"
Genesis 50:5,"‘My father made me swear, saying, “I am about to die. Be sure to bury me in the grave which I made ready for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now, therefore, let me go up and bury my father; then I shall return.’”"
Genesis 50:6,"And Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you promise on oath.”"
Genesis 50:7,"So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the officials of Pharaoh, the senior members of his court, and all of Egypt’s dignitaries,"
Genesis 50:8,"together with all of Joseph’s household, his brothers, and his father’s household; only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the region of Goshen."
Genesis 50:9,"Chariots, too, and horsemen went up with him; it was a very large troop."
Genesis 50:10,"When they came to Goren<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Goren </b>Or “the threshing floor of.”</i> ha-Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they held there a very great and solemn lamentation; and he observed a mourning period of seven days for his father."
Genesis 50:11,"And when the Canaanite inhabitants of the land saw the mourning at Goren ha-Atad, they said, “This is a solemn mourning on the part of the Egyptians.” That is why it was named Abel-mizraim,<sup>*</sup><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote""><b>Abel-mizraim </b>Interpreted as “the mourning of the Egyptians.”</i> which is beyond the Jordan."
Genesis 50:12,Thus his sons did for him as he had instructed them.
Genesis 50:13,"His sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, the field near Mamre, which Abraham had bought for a burial site from Ephron the Hittite."
Genesis 50:14,"After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father."
Genesis 50:15,"When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph still bears a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrong that we did him!”"
Genesis 50:16,"So they sent this message to Joseph, “Before his death your father left this instruction:"
Genesis 50:17,"So shall you say to Joseph, ‘Forgive, I urge you, the offense and guilt of your brothers who treated you so harshly.’ Therefore, please forgive the offense of the servants of the God of your father’s [house].” And Joseph was in tears as they spoke to him."
Genesis 50:18,"His brothers went to him themselves, flung themselves before him, and said, “We are prepared to be your slaves.”"
Genesis 50:19,"But Joseph said to them, “Have no fear! Am I a substitute for God?"
Genesis 50:20,"Besides, although you intended me harm, God intended it for good, so as to bring about the present result—the survival of many people."

Genesis 50:22,So Joseph and his father’s household remained in Egypt. Joseph lived one hundred and ten years.
Genesis 50:23,Joseph lived to see children of the third generation of Ephraim; the children of Machir son of Manasseh were likewise born upon Joseph’s knees.
Genesis 50:24,"At length, Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die. God will surely take notice of you and bring you up from this land to the land promised on oath to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”"

Genesis 50:26,Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years; and he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.
