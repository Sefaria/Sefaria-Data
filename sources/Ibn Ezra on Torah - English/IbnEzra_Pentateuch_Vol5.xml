<p>The guidance provided by Rabbi Abraham Lipshitz has greatly improved the quality of this translation. Much of the library work necessary to supply references for ibn Ezra’s allusions was carried out at Chesed L’Avrohom Nachlas David, where the books are nearly always properly shelved; a few of the rarer volumes were found at the Asher Library of the Spertus Institute. The English translation of Pentateuchal passages was influenced by Rabbi Charles Kahane’s <i>Torah Yesharah</i>. The <i>Meḥoqeqey Yhuda</i> of the late Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky served as primary commentary on the text, supplemented by the commentary of the late Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Netter. For a short period of time I had access to Abraham Lipshitz’s copy of the Weiser commentary, which was greatly useful.</p>
<p>My greatest debt, however, is to Abraham ibn Ezra himself, and to his teachers and their teachers before them, who preserved and clarified traditions dating back to Moses, and gave them over to the keeping of future generations.</p>

<title>A Point of Law</title>
<p>Jewish law forbids one to accept payment for teaching Torah. Yet this book is not being given away — it is being sold. One must not conclude from the behavior of the publisher, however, that an individual is permitted to draw a salary for teaching. Several factors combine which possibly render the sale of this book permissible:</p>
<p align="blockquote">1) The cost of printing books is not directly proportional to the number of books printed. Publishing entails both fixed costs and variable costs. Certain initial expenses — e.g., setting up the plates — must occur no matter how many copies are made. Other expenses — e.g., buying paper — depend on the size of the printing. Thus, unless you can predict exactly how many copies you will sell, it is impossible to establish a selling price that guarantees neither a profit nor a loss. Consequently, a sufficiently popular book will necessarily make money, while a sufficiently unpopular book will necessarily lose money, and there is no way to avoid both possibilities simultaneously.</p>
<p align="blockquote">2) The prohibition against teaching Torah professionally extends only to the oral Torah (<i>tora sheb‘al peh</i>). One is permitted to collect a fee for teaching the written Torah (<i>tora shebikhtav</i>). Although this book contains <i>tora sheb‘al peh</i>, it also contains <i>tora shebikhtav</i>; the portions of the book which may be sold are inseparable from the portions of the book which may not be sold.</p>
<p align="blockquote">3) The author of the book has been dead for several centuries and will collect no earthly royalties from it. The only people collecting royalties will be the publisher and the translator. Translating someone else’s teachings is not the same thing as teaching something yourself, therefore it may be forbidden to do the latter, but not the former, for money. (This reason is probably the weakest of the four. Every translation is perforce an interpretation. Ibn Ezra himself often called the early Sages the <i>ma‘atiqim</i>.)</p>
<p align="blockquote">4) A book is a physical commodity. Conceivably, giving a lecture falls under the definition of “teaching”, but selling a commodity does not fall under that definition.</p>
<p>The absence of any of these four factors would have rendered the sale of this book of questionable legality. In fact, the legality of the sale ought still to be considered questionable. I do not hereby supply a <i>psaq din</i>, and no one should derive a <i>hetter</i> for similar behavior either from my actions or from their defense.</p>
<p>It should go without saying — but perhaps it must be said — that these words must not serve as a pretext for criticizing the well-intentioned actions of any other human being. Observing <i>Hilkhot Talmud Tora</i>, 1:7, does not allow one to disregard <i>Hilkhot De‘ot</i>, 2:3. Whoever uses the above point of law to justify feelings of disrespect or disdain commits a crime far more serious than any which I have here tried to prevent.</p>

<p align="blockquote">In the Name of the One Who speaks Truth to the Just,</p>
<p align="blockquote">Who creates, and directs, and disposes —</p>
<p align="blockquote">I begin my attempt to explain and discuss</p>
<p align="blockquote">The fifth of the Five Books of Moses.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn1">[1:1]</xref></sup>These are the words which Moshe addressed to all Israel beyond the Jordan River, in the wilderness, in the desert, across the Red Sea, between Paran and Tofel, and Lavan, and Ḥaṣerot, and Di-Zahav. <sup><xref rid="fn2">[2]</xref></sup>It is eleven days from Ḥorev by way of Mount Seir to Qadesh Barnea. <sup><xref rid="fn3">[3]</xref></sup>At the end of the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moshe addressed the children of Israel as to all that G<small>OD</small> had commanded him concerning them. <sup>[4]</sup>After he had defeated Sihon, the King of the Amorites, who was seated in Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, who was seated at Ashtaroth, in Edrei. <sup><xref rid="fn4">[5]</xref></sup>Beyond the Jordan, by the land of Moab, Moshe began to expound this Torah, saying: <sup><xref rid="fn5">[6]</xref></sup>“G<small>OD</small> our God spoke to us in Ḥorev, saying: ‘You have tarried enough at this mountain; <sup><xref rid="fn6">[7]</xref></sup>turn away, move out! Come to the hill country of the Amorites and its neighboring countries. Go by the plain, in the mountains, in the lowland and the Negev, by the seashore until you reach the land of the Canaanites and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. <sup>[8]</sup>Mark! I am giving over the land before you. Come and inherit the land which G<small>OD</small> promised your forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to give to them and to their descendants after them.’ <sup><xref rid="fn7">[9]</xref></sup>At that time I said to you: ‘I am not able to lead you alone. <sup><xref rid="fn8">[10]</xref></sup>G<small>OD</small>, your God has increased you, so that today you are as many as the stars in heaven. <sup><xref rid="fn9">[11]</xref></sup>— May G<small>OD</small> the God of your fathers multiply you a thousand times, and bless you as He promised you — <sup><xref rid="fn10">[12]</xref></sup>How can I single-handedly bear your troubles, and your burden, and your strife? <sup><xref rid="fn11">[13]</xref></sup>Propose men from each one of your tribes, wise men, people of understanding, well-known, and I shall appoint them as chiefs over you.’ <sup>[14]</sup>You answered me by saying: ‘It is a good suggestion which you have proposed.’ <sup><xref rid="fn12">[15]</xref></sup>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and renowned men, and I appointed these chiefs over you, captains of thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, captains of tens, and officers, for your tribes. <sup><xref rid="fn13">[16]</xref></sup>I cautioned your judges at that time, saying: Listen between your brethren and execute justice between a man and his neighbor, and between landlord and tenant. <sup><xref rid="fn14">[17]</xref></sup>You must not recognize any person in court cases; you must listen to the small the same way as to the great; you must not fear any personality, for justice is of God; but the case that is too difficult for you, you will bring to me, and I will hear it. <sup><xref rid="fn15">[18]</xref></sup>I myself instructed you at that time in all the things which you must practice. <sup><xref rid="fn16">[19]</xref></sup>We marched from Ḥorev through all that vast and fearful wilderness which you saw, on the way to the Amorite highlands, just as G<small>OD</small> our God directed us, and we arrived at Qadesh-Barnea. <sup>[20]</sup>When you came to the hill-country of the Amorites, which G<small>OD</small> our God had given us, I said to you: <sup><xref rid="fn17">[21]</xref></sup>‘Look! G<small>OD</small> your God has set the land before you; arise, occupy it, as G<small>OD</small> the God of your fathers has told you. Have no fear, neither be alarmed.’ <sup><xref rid="fn18">[22]</xref></sup>But all of you approached me and pleaded: ‘Let us send men ahead of us to delve into the land for us, bring back a report of the route for our invasion of the land, and of the cities against which we should move.’ <sup><xref rid="fn19">[23]</xref></sup>The matter pleased me, so I selected twelve of your men, one man for every tribe. <sup>[24]</sup>They left, went up into the mountains, and came to the valley of Eshkol and explored it. <sup><xref rid="fn20">[25]</xref></sup>They took some fruit of the land with them, brought it down to us with their report stating: ‘The land which the G<small>OD</small> our God has given us is a good land.’ <sup>[26]</sup>But you refused to go up; you rebelled against the promise of G<small>OD</small> your God. <sup><xref rid="fn21">[27]</xref></sup>You protested in your tents, saying: ‘Because G<small>OD</small> hated us, He brought us out of Egypt to destroy us by delivering us into the hands of the Amorites. <sup>[28]</sup>Why should we go up? Our brethren have broken the courage of our heart by telling us that the people are greater and taller than we and the cities are larger and fortified up to heaven. Moreover, the Anakim giants are seen there.’ <sup><xref rid="fn22">[29]</xref></sup>Then I pleaded with you: ‘Do not panic and be not afraid before them, <sup><xref rid="fn23">[30]</xref></sup>G<small>OD</small> your God who goes before you, He will fight for you, just as He did before your eyes in Egypt; <sup>[31]</sup>and in the wilderness, where you have seen how G<small>OD</small> your God carried you as a father carries his son, throughout the way that you went until you arrived at this place.’ <sup>[32]</sup>Yet on this occasion you did not trust in G<small>OD</small> your God, <sup><xref rid="fn24">[33]</xref></sup>who went before you on the way, to seek out a place for your encampment. He leads you by a pillar of fire by night to show you which way to go, and in a column of cloud by day. <sup>[34]</sup>When G<small>OD</small> heard the sounds of your words, He was angry and decided: <sup>[35]</sup>‘None of these men — not the entire evil generation — will see the good land which I promised to give your fathers — <sup><xref rid="fn25">[36]</xref></sup>except Caleb, the son of Yephunneh; he will see it, and I will give the territory upon which he trod to him and his children, for he had followed the will of G<small>OD</small>.’ <sup><xref rid="fn26">[37]</xref></sup>G<small>OD</small> was angry with me also on your account, saying: ‘Neither will you enter there. <sup><xref rid="fn27">[38]</xref></sup>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, will go there. Strengthen him, for he will allot it to Israel. <sup><xref rid="fn28">[39]</xref></sup>Moreover, your little ones whom you said would be plunder — your children who on the day did not know to distinguish between good and evil — they will go there, and I will give the land to them; they will occupy it. <sup>[40]</sup>But as for you, turn back and march through the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea.’ <sup><xref rid="fn29">[41]</xref></sup>You answered me: ‘We have sinned against G<small>OD</small>. We will go up and fight as G<small>OD</small> our God commanded us.’ Each of you armed himself with weapons of war and you essayed up to the hill-country. <sup>[42]</sup>But G<small>OD</small> said to me: ‘Warn them. Do not go up or fight, for I am not among you, that you not be defeated by your enemies.’ <sup>[43]</sup>So I spoke to you and you did not obey; but you rebelled against the warning of G<small>OD</small>, and wantonly went up toward the hill-country. <sup><xref rid="fn30">[44]</xref></sup>Then the Amorites who lived in the hill-country came out to meet you and chased you as do the bees. They crushed you at Seir, until Ḥormah. <sup>[45]</sup>You returned and wept before G<small>OD</small>; but G<small>OD</small> did not hear your voice, and He was not attentive to you. <sup><xref rid="fn31">[46]</xref></sup>So you stayed in Qadesh many years, as the days when you stayed. <sup>[2:1]</sup>We then turned back, and marched through the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea, as G<small>OD</small> told me to do; and we circled mount Seir a long while…</p>
<p><sup>[2]</sup>G<small>OD</small> said to me: <sup>[3]</sup>‘You have gone around this mountain long enough; turn toward Canaan, northward. <sup>[4]</sup>And instruct the people as follows: “You are to pass along the border of your kinsmen, the Children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; they will be afraid of you, but you be careful — <sup><xref rid="fn32">[2:5]</xref></sup>do not provoke them, for I will not give you even one footstep of their land, because I have given mount Seir to Esau as an inheritance. <sup><xref rid="fn33">[6]</xref></sup>You may buy food from them, with money, that you may eat; and you may also buy water from them, with money, that you may drink. <sup><xref rid="fn34">[7]</xref></sup>For G<small>OD</small> your God has blessed you in all your actions; He has overseen your march through this vast wilderness; these forty years G<small>OD</small> your God has been with you, you have lacked nothing.”’ <sup>[8]</sup>So we by-passed our kinsmen, the Children of Esau, who dwell in Seir. We took the route of the desert, from Elath, and Etzion-Gaver,</p>
<p>then turned and passed by way of the wilderness of Moab. <sup><xref rid="fn35">[9]</xref></sup>G<small>OD</small> said to me: ‘Neither besiege nor provoke them to war; for I will not give you any of their land as an inheritance, because I have given ‘Ar to the descendants of Lot as an inheritance.’ <sup><xref rid="fn36">[10]</xref></sup>Its original inhabitants were the ’Emim, a great, numerous and tall people as were the Anakim — <sup><xref rid="fn37">[11]</xref></sup>they, too, were considered Refaim, like the Anakim, but the Moabites call them ’Emim. <sup><xref rid="fn38">[12]</xref></sup>Seir was originally inhabited by the Horites, but the children of Esau dispossessed them by destroying them from there, and dwelt there in their stead just as Israel is doing to the land of his inheritance, which G<small>OD</small> has given them. <sup>[13]</sup>‘Now, arise and pass the brook of Zered!’ So we passed the brook of Zered. <sup>[14]</sup>The time from when we started marching from Qadesh-Barnea, until we passed the brook of Zered, was thirty-eight years, during which all that generation of military age expired from among the camp just as G<small>OD</small> had sworn to them. <sup><xref rid="fn39">[15]</xref></sup>Moreover, G<small>OD</small>’s hand was against them, to annihilate them from among the camp, till they expired. <sup><xref rid="fn40">[16]</xref></sup>When all the military-aged men among the people had expired —</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn41">[17]</xref></sup>G<small>OD</small> spoke to me: <sup><xref rid="fn42">[18]</xref></sup>‘You are about to pass, now, the border of Moab — the territory of ‘Ar; <sup><xref rid="fn43">[19]</xref></sup>you will come toward the Children of Ammon, do not besiege them, and do not provoke them; for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon as an inheritance, because I have given it to the descendants of Lot as an inheritance.’ <sup><xref rid="fn44">[20]</xref></sup>That, also, is considered the land of the Refaim. It was originally settled by the Refaim, whom the Ammonites call <i>Zamzummim</i>, <sup><xref rid="fn45">[21]</xref></sup>a people great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim. But G<small>OD</small> destroyed them, and they succeeded them, and inhabited their land, <sup><xref rid="fn46">[22]</xref></sup>as He did for the children of Esau who occupied Seir when He destroyed the Ḥorites from before them, and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead to this day. <sup><xref rid="fn47">[23]</xref></sup>But the Avvim who dwelt in open towns as far as Gaza, the Cretans who came forth out of Crete destroyed them and occupied their land. <sup><xref rid="fn48">[24]</xref></sup>‘Arise, march on, and pass over the brook of Arnon. Mark! I have given Sihon the king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land into your hand. Begin to occupy! Challenge him to war. <sup>[25]</sup>From today on I shall spread your dread and fear upon all the people that are under the whole heaven. Whoever hears of your fame will tremble and be in anguish because of you.’ <sup><xref rid="fn49">[26]</xref></sup>I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon the king of Heshbon, peaceful messages, saying as follows: <sup><xref rid="fn50">[27]</xref></sup>‘I would pass through your land. I will go by the road, only by the road. I will not turn either right or left. <sup><xref rid="fn51">[28]</xref></sup>You will sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink, only let me pass through in my march — <sup><xref rid="fn52">[29]</xref></sup>as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir did for me, and the Moabites who dwell in ‘Ar — so that I may pass the Jordan into the land which G<small>OD</small> our God gives us.’ <sup>[30]</sup>But Sihon, the King of Heshbon, refused to let us pass through him; for G<small>OD</small> your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, in order that He might deliver him into your hand, as you see it today.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn53">[31]</xref></sup>G<small>OD</small> said to me: ‘Mark! I have begun to hand over Sihon and his land to you; begin the occupation; take possession of his land! <sup>[32]</sup>Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to wage war in Jahaz, <sup><xref rid="fn54">[33]</xref></sup>and G<small>OD</small> our God delivered him to us, and we defeated him, his sons, and all his people. <sup><xref rid="fn55">[34]</xref></sup>When we had conquered his cities at that time, we exterminated in every town, the men, the women and the children; we left no survivors. <sup>[35]</sup>Only the cattle did we take for booty, together with the other spoil of the cities which we had conquered. <sup><xref rid="fn56">[36]</xref></sup>From Aroer, which is on the edge of the brook of Amon, and the city which was built on the brook, up to Gilead, there was not a city too strong for us; G<small>OD</small> our God rendered everything to us. <sup><xref rid="fn57">[37]</xref></sup>Only against the land of the Children of ‘Ammon you did not approach any area, all along the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill-country, and all the places which G<small>OD</small> our God has commanded us not to conquer. <sup>[3:1]</sup>We turned, going up through Bashan, and Og, king of Bashan, came out against us — he and all his people — to battle us at Edrei. <sup>[2]</sup>But G<small>OD</small> said to me: ‘Do not be afraid of him, I will deliver him, all his people, and his land into your hand; and you will do to him as you have done to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon.’ <sup><xref rid="fn58">[3:3]</xref></sup>So G<small>OD</small> our God also gave ‘Og, king of Bashan, and all his people into our hand; we defeated him without having left him any survivor. <sup><xref rid="fn59">[4]</xref></sup>We conquered all his towns at that time. There was not a city which we had not taken from them: sixty towns, all the ’Argov group in the kingdom of ‘Og in Bashan. <sup>[5]</sup>All these were fortified cities with high walls, gates, and bolts, apart from the very many open towns. <sup>[6]</sup>We exterminated them as we had done to Sihon king of Heshbon, exterminating every town — the men, the women, and the children. <sup>[7]</sup>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the towns we retained for ourselves. <sup>[8]</sup>At that time we took the land out of the domain of the two Amorite kings in the eastern Jordan, from the brook of Arnon to Mount Hermon. <sup>[9]</sup>The Sidonians call Hermon Syria, and the Amorites call it Senir. <sup>[10]</sup>All the cities of the plain, the entire Gilead and the entire Bashan, even Salcah and Edrei, the capitals of Og in Bashan. <sup><xref rid="fn60">[11]</xref></sup>Only Og, king of Bashan, remained of the remnant of the Refaim. His bed, an iron bed, is still preserved in Rabbath-Ammon; its length is nine cubits, and its width four cubits, of a man’s cubit. <sup>[12]</sup>The land which we occupied at that time — from Aroer, which is on the brook of Arnon, and the half of the hill-country of Gilead and its towns — I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites. <sup>[13]</sup>The rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, indeed, all the royal provinces of Bashan — which is called Refaim land — I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh. <sup><xref rid="fn61">[14]</xref></sup>Ya’ir the son of Manasseh received all the capital royal provinces of Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Ma‘akatites, and named them after himself: Havoth Ya’ir of Bashan to this day. <sup><xref rid="fn62">[15]</xref></sup>To Machir I gave Gilead. <sup><xref rid="fn63">[16]</xref></sup>And that which I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites, was from Gilead to the brook of Arnon, within the brook, and boundary, and to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the Children of Ammon; <sup><xref rid="fn64">[17]</xref></sup>the desert also — and the Jordan and bank — from the Lake of Galilee to the sea of the desert, the Dead Sea, under the Spring of Pisgah eastward. <sup><xref rid="fn65">[18]</xref></sup>I commanded you at that time, as follows: ‘G<small>OD</small> our God gave you this land for a possession. All your warriors must pass as a vanguard before your brethren the Children of Israel. <sup>[19]</sup>Only your wives, your children, and your cattle — of which I know you have in abundance — will stay in your cities which I have given you. <sup>[20]</sup>Until G<small>OD</small> lets your brethren settle down as you and they too occupy the land which G<small>OD</small> your God is giving them on the West side of the Jordan, then may you return, everyone of you, to his inheritance which I have given you.’ <sup>[21]</sup>I also instructed Joshua at that time: ‘You have seen with your own eyes all that G<small>OD</small> your God has done to these two kings; so will G<small>OD</small> do to all the kingdoms toward which you are crossing. <sup>[22]</sup>You must not be afraid of them, for it is G<small>OD</small> your God Who fights for you.’</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn66">[23]</xref></sup>At that time I begged grace of G<small>OD</small>, as follows: <sup><xref rid="fn67">[24]</xref></sup>‘G<small>OD</small>! You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness, and Your mighty power. There is no other power, either in heaven or on earth, who can perform such deeds as You, and so mighty as Your might. <sup>[25]</sup>Let me, please, cross over and see the good land which is in the western part of the Jordan, the goodly mountain land and the Lebanon.’ <sup>[26]</sup>But G<small>OD</small>, Who was furious with me on your account, did not heed me, and G<small>OD</small> said to me: ‘Enough! Do not speak anymore to Me about this matter. <sup><xref rid="fn68">[27]</xref></sup>Ascend the summit of Pisgah, and direct your eyes westward, northward, southward, and eastward, and see it with your eyes, for you will not cross over this Jordan. <sup>[28]</sup>Instruct Joshua, strengthen him, and encourage him — for he will cross before this people, he will allot them the land which you will see.’ <sup><xref rid="fn69">[29]</xref></sup>So we stayed in the Gai, across Bet-Peor.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1"><b>[1:<small>1</small>]</b> The correct interpretation of <b>These are the words</b> is that the commandments written in the upcoming <i>parashiyyot</i> of <i>R<sup>ə</sup></i><sup>⊃</sup><i>eh</i>, <i>Shof<sup>ə</sup>ṭim</i>, <i>Ki Teṣeh</i>, and <i>Ki Tavo</i> had already been given to the Israelites when they were <b>in the wilderness.</b> In other words, the phrase <b>that Moshe spoke</b> is modified by the entire remainder of the verse, as if Scripture had repeated it, saying: “These are the words that Moshe spoke to all Israel, which Moshe had spoken in the wilderness, and in the desert across the Red Sea…” starting from the day that they left Sinai. <b>between Paran and Tofel, and Lavan, and Ḥaṣerot, and Di-Zahav</b> These places are either not mentioned in the <i>parasha</i> of <i>Mas</i><sup>⊂</sup><i>ey</i>, or they are mentioned under different names. Many places have several different names (e.g., Mount S̀<sup>ə</sup>nir has three other names [<i>cf</i>. 3:<small>9</small> and 4:<small>48</small>]).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn2"><b>[2]</b> Scripture says <b>eleven days</b> to tell us that Moshe spoke these words during those eleven days wherein they traveled from <b>Ḥorev</b> to <b>Qadesh Barnea<sup>⊂</sup>.</b> I shall later inform you that the spies started out from Qadesh Barnea<sup>⊂</sup> [<i>comment on</i> :<small>3</small>] [<i>see also</i> Numbers 32:<small>8</small>]; after G<small>OD</small> swore that they would not enter the land, no new commandments were given until the fortieth year — for so it is written [Bava Batra 121a–121b] [Ta‘anit 30b] [<i>cf</i>. 2:<small>16–17</small>]. Conclusive evidence is found in the phrase “to expound this Torah” [:<small>5</small>]: He explained the Torah <i>that he had already spoken</i> between Paran and Tofel. Note that most of the Commandments are repeated in this book. Accordingly, the upcoming phrase “all that G<small>OD</small> had commanded him concerning them” [:<small>3</small>] is properly modified by the preceding phrases “across the Jordan” [:<small>1</small>] and “in the desert wilderness” [:<small>1</small>]. If you can grasp the mystery behind the following problematic passages:
1) The final twelve verses of this book
2) “Moshe wrote…” [31:<small>22</small>]
3) “At that time, the Canaanites dwelt in the land” [Genesis 12:<small>6</small>]
4) “…In the mountain of G<small>OD</small>, He will appear” [Genesis 22:<small>14</small>]
5) “behold, his bed is a bed of iron…” [3:<small>11</small>]
you will then understand the truth. ¶ There are those who say that the reason for mentioning <b>It is eleven day’s journey from Ḥorev, by way of Mount S̀e<sup>⊂</sup>ir, to Qadesh Barnea<sup>⊂</sup></b> is to stress that they wandered in the wilderness for forty years — hence, the contrasting phrase
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn3"><b>[3] in the fortieth year.</b> This interpretation is incorrect, because they came to Qadesh Barnea<sup>⊂</sup> in the second year [:<small>19</small>]. The phrase <b>in the fortieth year</b> actually modifies the phrase “Moshe spoke” [:<small>1</small>].¶ Some people assert that Moshe died on the first of Sh<sup>ə</sup>vaṭ. They claim that after the nation mourned over Moshe for a period of thirty days [<i>cf</i>. 34:<small>8</small>], they remained there for approximately six more weeks [<i>cf</i>. Joshua 4:<small>19</small>]. Their evidence is the phrase “that same day” [32:<small>48</small>] — that is to say, they maintain that Moshe recounted this entire book to all Israel on a single day, and then died. This evidence is invalid, however, because “that same day” refers only to the recitation of the song. Besides, Scripture says elsewhere “you are soon [literally: today] to pass over the Jordan” [9:<small>1</small>]. ¶ I have already explained the word <b>on the eleventh</b> in the <i>parasha</i> of <i>Nas̀o</i> [<i>comment on</i> Numbers 7:<small>72</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn4"><b>[5] Moshe began</b> [and] <b>expounded</b> Scripture employs two consecutive verbs in the past tense, without a connective <i>vav</i>. Compare “turned away [and] was gone” [Song of Songs 5:<small>6</small>]. Moshe began to expound to the children born in the wilderness what had happened to their parents. He told them all of the laws. He also repeated the Ten Commandments — for, their parents having heard them from G<small>OD</small>, Moshe was desirous that they too should be able to hear them from a faithful representative.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn52"><b>[29] as the children of <sup>⊂</sup>Es̀av did for me</b>

Some commentators relate this phrase to “you will sell me food for money” [:<small>28</small>], but if this be so, how can they reconcile it with the inhabitants of <sup>⊂</sup>Ar, who are <b>Moabites,</b> and of whom Scripture says “because they did not approach you …” [23:<small>5</small>]? They feel constrained to give this interpretation, though, because the king of <sup>⊃</sup>Edom said, “you shall not pass through me” [Numbers 20:<small>18</small>].
In my opinion, the phrase refers back to the request that we go along the main highway, <b>as the children of <sup>⊂</sup>Es̀av did for me</b> — i.e., they let them go around Mount S̀e<sup>⊂</sup>ir along the main highway. Scripture accordingly related, “You are to pass along the border of your kinsmen, the Children of <sup>⊂</sup>Es̀av, who dwell in S̀e<sup>⊂</sup>ir” [:<small>4</small>]. However, the king of <sup>⊃</sup>Edom did not let them pass through <i>by way of</i> his territory (from which point they would have been close to the land of Canaan), so they went on to <sup>⊂</sup>Ar — as it is written [:<small>18</small>].
Many others have proposed that, although “they did not approach you” [23:<small>5</small>], nevertheless Israel <i>did</i> purchase from the Moabites.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn53"><b>[31] I have begun</b> [Hebrew: <i>haḥilloty</i>] The inflectional prefix <i>heh</i> is vocalized with a <i>pattaḥ</i> on account of the subsequent guttural consonant.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn60"><b>[11] a man’s cubit</b> i.e., a normal man’s cubit — thus indicating that he was twice an ordinary man’s size (it is implausible that Scripture meant his <i>own</i> cubit, because then Scripture would be telling us nothing about his size — and moreover, it would imply that he was not at all shaped like a human being).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn61"><b>[14]</b> I have already explained [<i>comment on</i> Numbers 32:<small>41</small>] that <b>Ya’ir the son of M<sup>ə</sup>nasheh</b> was actually from the tribe of Y<sup>ə</sup>hudah. <b>Geshurites</b> and <b>Ma<sup>⊂</sup>akatites</b> are the names of two nations.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn65"><b>[18]</b> Although Moshe spoke only to the tribes of Reuven and Gad, he said <b>I commanded you</b> because they were a constituent part of Israel. Moshe speaks synecdochically in the opposite sense when he says to the Levites (in the passage beginning with “Take this book of the Torah” [31:<small>26</small>]) “For I know your rebellious nature” [31:<small>27</small>]: He was not then speaking only to the Levites, but to all Israel. However, since the Levites were included, he continued to address them.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn66"><b>[23] I begged grace</b> i.e., I <i>had already</i> begged grace. Scripture has just mentioned [:<small>21</small>] Moshe’s instructions to Joshua; but Moshe instructed Joshua only in consequence of “I will not cross [with you]” [4:<small>22</small>]. I did indeed beg G<small>OD</small>’s grace to cross over with you, because the greatness of G<small>OD</small> “is unsearchable” [Psalms 145:<small>3</small>]; and “They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness” [Lamentations 3:<small>23</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn67"><b>[24]</b> The intention of the following passage is to endear the Land of Israel; for if the land is cherished, they will keep G<small>OD</small>’s commandments so as not to be exiled from it. <b>You have begun</b> He said: You are infinitely wise, for You have begun to <b>show … Your greatness … in heaven and on earth,</b> through natural events. <b>Your mighty power</b> Moshe refers to the signs which he repeatedly performed, until it was known throughout the world that there is no God other than Him alone: prepotent <b>in heaven</b> (home of the angels and the Heavenly Host) and <b>on earth</b> (home of animals and men). <b>deeds</b> which are wholly wise <b>might</b> i.e., You are capable of anything.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn69"><b>[29] we stayed in the Gai</b> i.e., we <i>had already</i> stayed in the Gai (which was near the “summit of Pisgah”), since from there we went to the plains of Mo’av. The passage is explained correctly by assuming that the Gai forms part of the hills of <sup>⊂</sup>Avarim [Numbers 33:<small>48</small>]. Moshe now begins to talk about the commandments; and, since they were <b>across Bet-P<sup>⊂</sup>or</b>, he begins by discussing idolatry.

Any clear-headed, unbiased person must realize from the evidence that G<small>OD</small> alone is God: <b>in heaven above</b> (i.e., above man) and <b>upon the earth beneath</b> (i.e., beneath man. Man is the standard of comparison, as in “The skies above you will be like brass…” [28:<small>23</small>]). You, having seen all these wonders, having <b>impressed it upon your hearts,</b> must
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn106"><b>[40]</b> keep his commandments. Moreover, they are good for you, and for <b>your children after you.</b>

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn109"><b>[5:<small>1</small>] Moshe called out to all Israel</b> to announce the terms of the covenant to the children (as I have explained).

or

G<small>OD</small> <b>did not enter this covenant with our ancestors</b> who were in Egypt, but, rather, <b>with us</b>. There were still many people in that camp who had heard the covenant spoken by G<small>OD</small>. That is why Moshe says, “we” — i.e., those who are still alive and with us now. The fact that Moshe uses the terms “to you” [:<small>4</small>] and “between you” [:<small>6</small>] is evidence for the correctness of this interpretation.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn112"><b>[4] face to face</b> i.e., without an intermediary. When someone’s voice can be heard directly, it is called “face to face”, even if his face cannot be seen.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn113"><b>[5] I stood between</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>and you</b> I have already explained this. Most likely, <b>I stood between</b> G<small>OD</small>… applies <i>after</i> the gathering at Sinai. At Sinai, He spoke to you face to face; but from that day onward, <b>I stood between</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>and you,</b> because <b>you were afraid,</b> as shall be explained. <b>you were afraid of the fire</b> even though <b>you did not ascend the mountain</b> as I advocated, but “Moshe [alone] approached the dense cloud” [Exodus 20:<small>18</small>]. The word <b>saying:</b> refers back to “G<small>OD</small> spoke to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire” [:<small>4</small>]. Although it is far removed from its antecedent, many Hebrew sentences exhibit the same construction: the interpolated verse is not a part of the quote.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn114"><b>[6]</b> Do not be distressed that the wording is variant. Words are like bodies, whereas meanings are like souls. One can fashion two different utensils that perform the identical function. For example, “fraudulent” [:<small>17</small>] is synonymous to “false” [Exodus 20:<small>13</small>] — for everything false is fraudulent. Moreover, “Remember” [Exodus 20:<small>8</small>] is similar to “Keep” [:<small>12</small>], as I have already explained.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn115"><b>[12]</b> Moshe added the words <b>as</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>your God has commanded you,</b> referring to the assembly at Mount Sinai.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn116"><b>[14] nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock</b> a specification followed by a generalization. In the original [Exodus 20:<small>10</small>] only the generalization appears; but both passages mean the same thing. <b>so that</b> [even your slaves] <b>shall rest</b> Scripture proceeds to explain why <b>your man-servant and your maid-servant</b> are mentioned:
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn117"><b>[15] For you must remember that you were a slave</b> and you must consequently allow your own slave to rest <b>therefore</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>your God has commanded you</b> to observe this (allowing one’s slaves to rest) on the Sabbath day. In other words: G<small>OD</small> brought you out of slavery, and has ordered you to rest so that you shall remember that you were once a slave (according to some, the slaves themselves are not <i>required</i> to rest).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn118"><b>[16] has commanded you</b> see my explanation above [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 20:<small>1</small>] <b>that it may go well with you</b> Some say this is an allusion to the World to Come. I shall reveal part of the mystery of the World to Come in my comment on “I kill, and I bring to life” [32:<small>39</small>]. <b>your days</b> is the antecedent of the clause, i.e., that which will go well with you.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn119"><b>[18]</b> The Hebrew word ḥ-m-d has two different meanings. One meaning is robbery, oppression, taking from others through force or compulsion (as in, “no man will attack your land” [Exodus 34:<small>24</small>] — for if the verb denotes jealousy, then a verse intending to extol the land instead deprecates it!). The other meaning is jealousy, that does <i>not</i> express itself in overt action. All the scholars of antiquity believed that the First Commandment is “I am…” [:<small>6</small>] (even though it raises the question, why would one utter <i>two</i> commandments directly, and then stop?). I have already offered an explanation of the Ten Commandments that conforms to their belief. In my opinion, though, “I am…” is not one of the Ten Commandments. Rather, it introduces the Commander, and provides a basis for all the other Commandments, as I have already explained. “You shall not be jealous of your fellow-man’s house” [Exodus 20:<small>14</small>] is the Ninth Commandment, and “you shall not be jealous of your fellow-man’s wife” [Exodus 20:<small>14</small>] is the Tenth Commandment. Either “your fellow-man’s house” is part of the same Commandment as “your fellow-man’s wife”, or it is a separate principle in its own right. Here there is evidence for the latter: Moshe, explaining the Torah, in this book has replaced one instance of “you shall not be jealous” with “you shall not desire”. Many people have said that there is no sin in thinking something, and that thoughts carry neither reward nor punishment. I shall not go into the many proofs to the contrary at great length. Suffice to point out “The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to G<small>OD</small>” [Proverbs 15:<small>26</small>], “You did well, insofar as it was your intention” [I Kings 8:<small>18</small>], and “to those who are upright in their hearts” [Psalms 125:<small>4</small>]. Moshe himself summed it all up when he said “to do it with your mouth and with your heart” [30:<small>14</small>]. The core of all the commandments is the improvement of character — and the majority of them are essentially reminders [<i>see comment on</i> Leviticus 19:<small>19</small>]. Moreover, the existence of a distinction between an intentional sin and an accidental sin is definitive proof.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn120"><b>[19] These words</b> i.e., the Ten Commandments — but not the exact <i>wording</i> given above [<i>comment on</i> :<small>5</small>] <b>a mighty voice</b> the like of which they had never heard before <b>that has not continued</b> for this was the only revelation
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn121"><b>[20]</b> This verse explains why the people dispersed.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn123"><b>[23] the voice of the living</b> [<i>plural</i>] <b>God</b> Here the plural is used, as I have explained [<i>comment on</i> Genesis 1:<small>1</small>]. The word <b>living</b> in my opinion here designates the manifestation of God in Nature, as opposed to God Himself, Who does not move or change.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn124"><b>[24] then you</b> [<i>feminine</i>] <b>will communicate to us</b> Use of the feminine pronoun also occurs in “But if You [<i>feminine</i>] deal thus with me” [Numbers 11:<small>15</small>], where its appearance is explained in detail.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn125"><b>[25] has been agreeable</b> an <i>‘ayin-vav</i> verb in the past tense
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn126"><b>[26] Who would grant!</b> Scripture does not say, “who would grant <i>me</i>”, but rather, “who would grant <i>them</i>” (the word <b>them</b> is displaced in the sentence, and appears after <b>that they had such a will</b>). Know that the Divine decree underlies all actions and all phenomena, in the sense that the nature and potentiality of everything in the universe, including living creatures, is determined by the action of the constellations on the four elements. A creature’s behavior at every moment is governed by its nature and its potential. However, as the author of the <i>Sefer Y<sup>ə</sup>ṣira</i> has explained, a certain amount of deviation can exist. Individuals derive their nature from the species, and they can change their nature within the boundaries of their species’s potential. This is the meaning of “G<small>OD</small> hardened the heart of Pharaoh” [Exodus 9:<small>12</small>], although elsewhere Scripture asserts, “he hardened his heart; he and his officials” [Exodus 9:<small>34</small>]. Both statements are true. Accordingly the prophets have said, “I know, G<small>OD</small>, that the way of a man is not in himself” [Jeremiah 10:<small>23</small>] and “Why have you made us stray, G<small>OD</small>, from Your ways?” [Isaiah 63:<small>17</small>]. Nevertheless, Moshe said, “choose life” [30:<small>19</small>]. G<small>OD</small> does not prevent anyone from achieving good. Indeed, He wishes to bestow good; and Scripture says so anthropomorphically by using the expression, <b>Who would grant.</b>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn127"><b>[27] Go, tell them</b> implying that he descend from the mountain
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn128"><b>[28] But you stay here with Me</b> implying that he then re-ascend the mountain, as it is written: <b>and I will speak to you all the commandments, the decrees, and the judgments.</b> Thus, most of the Torah was told to Moshe on Mount Sinai. However, Moshe apparently transmitted it during the entirety of their stay in the Sinai Desert, as well as during the eleven days’ trip from Sinai.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn129"><b>[29] Now observe to practice</b> The purpose of this seemingly redundant verse is to add the injunction <b>do not turn aside to the right or the left</b>.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn130"><b>[30] all of the path</b> This metaphor explains the abovementioned “to the right or to the left” [:<small>29</small>] and it denotes
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn131"><b>[6:<small>1</small>] the instructions, the decrees, and the judgments</b> — the ultimate purpose of which is
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn132"><b>[2] that you will revere</b> — i.e., <b>you, your son, and your grandson.</b> Thus, the ultimate purpose of all the commandments is sincere faith. Faith is the fulfillment of man, and it is for faith that man was created, as it is written in Ecclesiastes [Ecclesiastes 12:<small>13</small>]. Faith will also <b>assure long life</b> — long life for the nation in the land of Israel, and long life for the individual in the World to Come.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn133"><b>[3] observe to practice I</b> command you to observe that which is for your own benefit. <b>a land flowing with milk…</b> either

this is the displaced object of the verb “to inherit” [:<small>1</small>]

or

the verse omits a preposition, and should read “<i>in</i> a land flowing with milk…”. See “in the house of God” [II Kings 12:<small>11</small>] for a similar construction.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn134"><b>[4]</b> Everything that our ancestors, of blessed memory, have transmitted concerning the reading of the <i>Shma‘</i> is true and needs no justification. Know that the glorious Name is God’s proper name [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 3:<small>15</small>]. If so, why is it immediately followed by another name of God? The answer is that the Name can serve <i>both</i> as a proper name, <i>and</i> elsewhere as a descriptive, but not a proper name (just as “man” [Hebrew: <sup>⊃</sup><i>adam</i>] is both a proper name [Genesis 3:<small>17</small>], and a descriptive name derived from “Earth” [Hebrew: <sup>⊃</sup><i>adama</i>]). The evidence for this is that there are places where the Name appears in the construct case (as in “the Lord of Hosts” [I Samuel 1:<small>11</small>]) and other places where it stands alone. The Name is then further repeated, to say: God, who is our Lord, is <i>one</i> God — in other words, He is absolutely unique. An uncountable number of things demonstrate G<small>OD</small>’s uniqueness.<sup><xref rid="fn165">1</xref></sup>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn135"><b>[5] you shall love</b> Since we have no gods other than He Himself, consequently you must love Him, there being no other god to love. <b>with all your heart</b> The “heart” denotes consciousness (and is here an allusion to the spirit of intelligence, corresponding to the first Divine Wheel [Ezekiel 1:<small>15</small>]), as in “wise of heart” [Exodus 31:<small>6</small>] and “acquires a heart” [Proverbs 15:<small>32</small>]. <b>with all your soul</b> denotes the corporeal spirit (i.e., desire). This force manifests itself in the kidneys. <b>with all your might</b> [Hebrew: <i>m’odekha</i>] from “much” [Hebrew: <i>m’od</i>] — in other words, to love Him exceedingly much — as much as you can — and that your love be unqualified.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn136"><b>[6] these words</b> The Dissenters [this term, which appears fifteen times in ibn Ezra’s commentary on Deuteronomy, is used by ibn Ezra to denote anyone who does not accept the Rabbinic tradition, in full or in part; in ibn Ezra’s time the dominant non-Rabbinic movement was the Karaites, but a “Dissenter” is anyone who questions the Rabbinic tradition: frequently, but not necessarily, a Karaite — Translator] have applied this phrase to the Ten Commandments (they also believe the Ten Commandments are meant below in “you shall write them on the doorposts of your houses” [:<small>9</small>]); but the truth is that <b>these words</b> denotes <i>all</i> the commandments.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn137"><b>[7] repeat them over</b> from “a sharp arrow” [Proverbs 25:<small>18</small>] — and it is well known that an arrow becomes sharp only after continuous, repeated sharpening. From this we see that the essence of Man is the service of G<small>OD</small>; and that one serves G<small>OD</small> by recognizing His works. The Exegetes, upon whom we all rely, have transmitted to us the prescribed times for the reading of the <i>Shma</i>‘: <b>when you sit</b> (this adverbial phrase modifies <b>speak of them) when you lie down</b> to sleep (for no commandments apply to someone who is actually sleeping). Thus we see that <b>speak of them</b> includes both speech and thought.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn138"><b>[8] Bind them as a sign upon your arm</b> literally. <b>frontlets</b> [Hebrew: <i>ṭoṭafot</i>] Scripture contains no related words. Although the Dissenters have said the word comes from “preach” [Ezekiel 21:<small>2</small>], this is unlikely, since the triliteral root of “preach” is n-ṭ-f, while this word is missing the <i>nun</i> and has two <i>ṭet</i>’s.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn139"><b>[9] You shall write them</b> The Dissenters have also disputed this commandment, claiming that it is figurative, as in “bind them about your neck” [Proverbs 3:<small>3</small>]; but we who have received the truth from our ancestors shall disregard these fabricators.

In other words, you shall not swear in the name of any god, other than G<small>OD</small> alone. But you may swear to affirm testimony, or to confirm a contract — so long as it is true.

There I explained the meaning of the name [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 17:<small>2</small>]. People were questioning whether “G<small>OD</small> is among us” [Exodus 17:<small>7</small>]: If so, we will worship him. But there is no need to put G<small>OD</small> to the test. Simply

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn152"><b>[25] It will be our privilege</b> Some say that this alludes to reward in the World to Come. Literally, though, it means that from the standpoint of strict justice, we are obliged to obey His will, because He is our Master. In my opinion the verse carries an additional meaning: All the nations will perceive that we are righteous, because we follow commandments and laws which are themselves righteous (for so it is written [4:<small>8</small>]).

<b>a thousand generations</b> “Thousand” here denotes “infinite”. Some people have incorrectly seen here an allusion to the theory that the planetary cycles repeat themselves every thirty-six thousand years. In fact, they repeat themselves approximately every seventy years.

Some people also compare the word to <i>“in</i> His face”, a Hebrew metaphor for “in His anger” [<i>cf. comment on</i> Leviticus 26:<small>17</small>], meaning that He will punish His enemies for having made themselves enemies of the Truth. <b>to destroy him; for his enemy He does not defer</b> Some interpret the verse to mean that the wicked are rewarded in this world for the good they have done, and He does not defer their reward for the World to Come. In my opinion, though, the correct interpretation contrasts the wicked against the righteous. Unlike them, who endure “a thousand generations” [:<small>9</small>], G<small>OD</small>’s enemies will perish, and will not continue into the future, although they may falsely expect their children or their grandchildren to survive (see “to the third and fourth generation” [Exodus 20:<small>5</small>]).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn161"><b>[11] Therefore keep</b> Just as G<small>OD</small> keeps the covenant, so must you keep His commandments.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn162"><sup>1</sup>Some people see an allusion in this verse to the commandment of studying the appearance of the stars — but, in my opinion, this is far-fetched.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn163"><sup>1</sup>The <i>parasha</i> of <i>Yitro</i> contains “God spoke…” [Exodus 20:<small>1</small>] as well as “the God answered him vocally” [Exodus 19:<small>19</small>]. In the latter passage Scripture explicitly uses the definite article, because speech everywhere is a manifestation of the Divine. Without a definite article, someone might misinterpret the word to denote Godliness, rather than God who is the source of Godliness.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn164"><sup>1</sup> This passage does <i>not</i> denote the future, as many have interpreted it. Witness the phrase “To him who smote great kings” [Psalms 136:<small>17</small>]. Although the Psalmist has mentioned Siḥon and ‘Og only, he says, “a heritage to Israel his servant” [Psalms 136:<small>22</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn165"><sup>1</sup>The verse that says, “on that day G<small>OD</small> will be one, and His name one” [Zechariah 14:<small>15</small>] speaks only of mankind’s <i>knowledge</i> of G<small>OD</small>. Moreover, in my opinion this verse refers to the acceptance of G<small>OD</small> as king. The passage is best translated: “G<small>OD</small> will be the king of the whole Earth. On that day G<small>OD</small> will be the only [king], with a single name.” Compare, “then I will convert the nations to a purer language” [Zephaniah 2:<small>9</small>]. When the entire world will speak a single language, then G<small>OD</small> will have a single name.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn166"><sup>1</sup>despite the fact that Scripture uses the definite article. Compare “Zevaḥ and Ṣalmunna<sup>⊂</sup> were in [the] Qarqor” [Judges 8:<small>10</small>] and “mustered them in [the] Ṭla<sup>⊃</sup>im” [I Samuel 15:<small>4</small>].

The connection between Tav<sup>⊂</sup>erah and Massah is that in both places the people were grumbling against — were testing, as it were — G<small>OD</small>.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn207"><b>[10:<small>1</small>] At that time</b> during the abovementioned [9:<small>25</small>] forty days. <b>a wooden ark</b> The Exegetes, of blessed memory, have said [Palestinian Talmud Soṭa 8:<small>3</small> (22b)] that Moshe himself made an original ark, different from the one that was later made. Their evidence is
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn208"><b>[3] I made an ark,</b> followed by <b>I hewed…,</b> after which Moshe says “I put the tablets into the ark which I had made” — and their understanding is greater than ours. ¶ But it would seem that “The glory of G<small>OD</small> dwelt” [Exodus 24:<small>16</small>] refers to the glory that the elders had already seen [Exodus 24:<small>10</small>]. The exact date of Moshe’s first ascent is not clear, and a surface reading of Scripture suggests that Moshe only fasted for eighty days: The period denoted by “I stayed on the mount, as the first days:” [:<small>10</small>] coincides with the second forty-day period [9:<small>25</small>], so that the sense of the passage is, When I had stayed in the mountain these forty days, G<small>OD</small> “hearkened” unto me [<i>cf</i>. :<small>10</small>], and said, “lead the march” [:<small>11</small>] — which is the same as “go, lead the people” [Exodus 32:<small>34</small>]. If all this be true, then the “wooden ark” [:<small>1</small>] was made at Moshe’s <i>command</i>, but it is actually the <i>same</i> ark that B<sup>ә</sup>ṣal<sup>כ</sup>el made [<i>cf</i>. Exodus 37:<small>1</small>]. <b>I made an ark</b> That is, he commanded that an ark be made. Consequently, “Moshe gathered” [Exodus 35:<small>1</small>] must mean, “Moshe <i>had</i> gathered” (I have already shown you many similar instances). ¶ All this was necessitated by the passage
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn209"><b>[5] they remained there as</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>had commanded me,</b> assuming that the reference is to “put the Testimony into the Ark” [Exodus 25:<small>16</small>]. Nevertheless, it is also possible that the reference is to “make for you a wooden ark” [:<small>1</small>]. In any case, the Tradition must prevail.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn210"><b>[6] The children of Israel traveled from B<sup>әכ</sup>erot-B<sup>ә</sup>né-Ya<sup>⊂ɐ</sup>qan to Moserah.</b> This verse is inserted here, because Moshe had said “I also prayed for the sake of Aaron at that time” [9:<small>20</small>]; Scripture accordingly informs us that Aaron did not die, until the fortieth year. The evidence for the correctness of this explanation is that, while they were at Mount Sinai, “at that time, G<small>OD</small> set apart the tribe of Levi” [:<small>8</small>] (as I have explained in my commentary on the <i>parasha</i> of <i>B<sup>ә</sup>midbar</i> [<i>comment on</i> Numbers 3:<small>1</small>]). Our ancestors asserted [Palestinian Talmud Yoma 1:<small>1</small> (38b)] that they backtracked to a previous encampment — but what then is to be done with the word “there” in <b><i>there</i> Aaron died, and <i>there</i> he was buried</b>? The Spaniard Rabbi Isaac ben Y<sup>ә</sup>hudah ibn Ghiyyat, of blessed memory, translated the word “there” into “then” (similarly, “from then on [literally: from there] he became a shepherd” [Genesis 49:<small>24</small>]). But in my opinion none of this is needed. Rather, <b>B<sup>әכ</sup>erot-B<sup>ә</sup>né-Ya<sup>⊂ɐ</sup>qan</b> is not the same as “B<sup>ә</sup>né-Ya<sup>⊂ɐ</sup>qan” [Numbers 33:<small>31</small>]; and also, <b>Moserah</b> is not the same as “Moserot” [Numbers 33:<small>30</small>]. <b>B<sup>әכ</sup>erot-B<sup>ә</sup>né-Ya<sup>⊂ɐ</sup>qan</b> is another name for Qadesh, and <b>Moserah</b> is the name of the desert region surrounding Mount Hor. There are many similar instances (e.g., note that Scripture calls a place “the Shur Wilderness” [Exodus 15:<small>22</small>], but in another verse says “the <sup>כ</sup>Eytam Wilderness” [Numbers 33:<small>8</small>]).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn211"><b>[7] From there they marched to Gudgod</b> This is not the same as “Ḥor-Haggidgad” [Numbers 33:<small>32</small>]. Rather, it is the general name for the region that includes Ṣalmonah [Numbers 23:<small>41</small>], Punon [Numbers 23:<small>42</small>], and also <sup>כ</sup>Ovot [Numbers 23:<small>43</small>]. <b>Yoṭvata</b> here is the place that is elsewhere called “B<sup>әכ</sup>er” (for so it is written: “from thence they went to B<sup>әכ</sup>er” [Numbers 21:<small>16</small>]), which explains the phrase <b>an area rich in brooks of water.</b> The nobles dug with their staves, and water flowed forth [<i>cf</i>. Numbers 21:<small>18</small>]. ¶ This verse, containing the statement <b>from there they marched to Gudgod,</b> is juxtaposed to “Eleazar ministered” [:<small>6</small>]. Even though I previously told you [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 29:<small>42</small>] that Israel offered no sacrifices after they left Mount Sinai, it seems likely that they did offer them when they arrived at Ṣalmonah and Punon. Thus the beginning of Eleazar’s ministry as High Priest occurred in those places, on Rosh HaShanah (he officiated in the place called B<sup>әכ</sup>er on Yom Kippur). The explanation, then, is as follows: “Eleazar officiated when they marched to such-and-such a place. And why was Eleazar the kohen? Because
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn212"><b>[8]</b> at the time of the worship of the Calf, G<small>OD</small> set apart <b>the tribe of Levi, to carry</b> the Ark, and <b>to stand before</b> G<small>OD</small>.” The Levites were <b>to minister before Him</b> together with the descendants of Aaron. <b>to bless in His name</b> for Eleazar used to give the Priestly Blessing [<i>cf</i>. Numbers 6:<small>24</small><i>ff</i>.].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn213"><b>[9]</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>is their allotment</b> along the lines of “G<small>OD</small> is the portion of my inheritance, and of my cup” [Psalms 16:<small>5</small>] — meaning, service of G<small>OD</small> through the study of His ways.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn214"><b>[10]</b> I have already explained <b>I stayed on the mount</b> [<i>comment on</i> :<small>1</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn215"><b>[11]</b> The word <b>lead the march</b> is a verbal noun.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn216"><b>[15] He has chosen their descendants</b> who are you — and the phrase is followed by the appositive <b>you</b>.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn217"><b>[16] Circumsize the foreskin of your hearts</b> by distancing yourselves from desires, which are as thick and as heavy as a foreskin. Perhaps the idiom also means: Purify your heart, so that it will understand the truth. I have explained the word <b>your neck</b> [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 32:<small>9</small>]. Moreover, the idiom is used here, because he previously had said “you are a stiff-necked people” [9:<small>6</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn218"><b>[17]</b> I have already explained the phrase <b>the Supreme Judge</b> [<i>comment on</i> Genesis 1:<small>1</small>]. <b>The Lord of lords</b> for there are levels of greatness among rulers, as in “and there are yet higher ones over them” [Ecclesiastes 5:<small>7</small>]. One who recognizes these attributes is “circumsized of heart” [<i>cf</i>. :<small>16</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn219"><b>[18] executes justice</b> Although He is lofty, He executes justice for the orphan and widow, who have no ally. Compare [Megilla 31a], “Father of the fatherless” [Psalms 68:<small>6</small>]. Likewise with respect to the alien: He will provide for those who depend on Him. Since G<small>OD</small> loves the alien,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn220"><b>[19]</b> you are required to love him.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn221"><b>[20] Revere</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>your God</b> do not violate the negative commandments. <b>Him shall you serve</b> through the positive commandments. <b>to Him will you cleave</b> in your heart. <b>by His Name you will swear</b> in speech (in the manner prescribed [Temurah 3b]).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn222"><b>[21] He is your glory</b> i.e., it is appropriate for you to glorify in Him, because He has done <b>awesome things</b> for you.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn223"><b>[22]</b> I have already explained <b>seventy souls</b> [<i>comment on</i> Genesis 46:<small>23</small>]. Since He has multipled you,

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn225"><b>[2] it is not your children</b> The conclusion of this sentence is “your own eyes have seen” [:<small>7</small>].

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn232"><b>[10] For the land…</b> After establishing that you are obliged to keep His commandments, the meaning of this passage is: For the land is not like the land of Egypt; rather,

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn234"><b>[13] If you will carefully follow …</b>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn235"><b>[14] I will give the rain for your land</b> — i.e., elaborating the abovementioned “the eyes of G<small>OD</small> your God are set upon it” [:<small>12</small>]. <b>early rain</b> [Hebrew: <i>yoreh</i>] The rain which notifies [Hebrew: <i>yoreh</i>] of a prosperous year, coming at the beginning of the season.

<p><sup><xref rid="fn242">[22]</xref></sup>Whereas if you carefully keep all these instructions that I instruct you and practice them: to love G<small>OD</small> your God, to follow all His ways, and to cleave to Him, <sup>[23]</sup>G<small>OD</small> will drive out all these nations from before you, and you will dispossess greater and mightier nations than you. <sup>[24]</sup>Every part of territory on which the sole of your foot treads will be yours; from the wilderness to the Lebanon, from the river — the river Euphrates — to the Mediter-ranean, will be your border. <sup>[25]</sup>No man will stand against you; G<small>OD</small> will put panic and the fear of you on all the land on which you will tread, as He promised you.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn243">[26]</xref></sup>Behold!

<p><sup><xref rid="fn245">[29]</xref></sup>When G<small>OD</small> your God brings you into the land which you go to possess, you will place the blessing upon Mount Gerizim, and the curse upon Mount Ebol. <sup><xref rid="fn246">[30]</xref></sup>These mountains are across the Jordan, toward the setting sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the plain opposite Gilgal, near ’Eloney Moreh. <sup><xref rid="fn247">[31]</xref></sup>For you are crossing the Jordan, coming to possess the land which G<small>OD</small> your God is giving you. When you possess it and dwell in it, <sup>[32]</sup>you must keep practicing all the decrees and the rules which I set before you today. <sup>[12:1]</sup>These are the decrees and the rules which you must keep, in the land which G<small>OD</small> the God of your fathers has given you to possess, all the days that you are on the earth. <sup><xref rid="fn248">[12:2]</xref></sup>You must utterly eradicate all the places in which the nations you are to dispossess, served their gods — on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every leafy tree. <sup><xref rid="fn249">[3]</xref></sup>Tear down their altars, smash their monoliths, and burn their <i>asherim</i> in fire; topple the statues of their gods; so that you destroy their name from that place. <sup><xref rid="fn250">[4]</xref></sup>You shall not do so to G<small>OD</small> your God, <sup><xref rid="fn251">[5]</xref></sup>but only to the place which G<small>OD</small> your God chooses, from all your tribes, to put His Name — you will seek out His abode, and you will go there. <sup>[6]</sup>There you will bring your burnt-offerings, your festival sacrifices, tithes, your first fruit, your vows and pledges, and the firstlings of your herd and flock. <sup><xref rid="fn252">[7]</xref></sup>And there you will eat before G<small>OD</small> your God, and enjoy all your undertakings — you together with your households, with which G<small>OD</small> your God has blessed you. <sup><xref rid="fn253">[8]</xref></sup>You must not do at all as we are doing here at the present time, everyone whatever he pleases, <sup><xref rid="fn254">[9]</xref></sup>for you have not yet reached the rest and the inheritance, which G<small>OD</small> your God is giving you. <sup><xref rid="fn255">[10]</xref></sup>But when you cross the Jordan and settle in the land which G<small>OD</small> your God gives you to inherit, and He grants you tranquility from all your enemies around you, so that you will dwell in safety; <sup><xref rid="fn256">[11]</xref></sup>then at the place in which G<small>OD</small> your God chooses to allow His Name to abide, there will you bring all that I commanded you: your burnt-offerings, and your festival sacrifices, your tithes and your first fruit, and all the choice of your vows which you vow to G<small>OD</small>. <sup><xref rid="fn257">[12]</xref></sup>You will rejoice before G<small>OD</small> your God — you, and your sons, and your daughters, your men-servants, and maid-servants — together with the Levite, who is within your gates, because he has no portion nor allotment with you. <sup><xref rid="fn258">[13]</xref></sup>Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt-offerings in every place which you deem suitable; <sup>[14]</sup>but only in the place which G<small>OD</small> will choose, within one of your tribes; there will you sacrifice your burnt-offerings, and there will you do all as I have instructed you. <sup><xref rid="fn259">[15]</xref></sup>However, within all of your gates, whenever you have a personal desire, you may slaughter and eat flesh, according to the blessing which G<small>OD</small> your God granted you. The ritually impure and the ritually pure may partake of it, as of the gazelle and the deer. <sup>[16]</sup>But the blood must you not eat; you will pour it out upon the ground like water. <sup><xref rid="fn260">[17]</xref></sup>You are not allowed to eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, your wine and your oil, or the firstlings of your herd and flock, nor any of your vows which you vowed, nor your pledges, nor the offerings of your first fruit; <sup><xref rid="fn261">[18]</xref></sup>but you may eat it before G<small>OD</small> your God, in the place which G<small>OD</small> your God will choose — you, your son, your daughter, your man-servant, and your maid-servant, together with the Levite who is within your gates; and you will rejoice before G<small>OD</small> your God in all your undertakings. <sup>[19]</sup>Be careful not to forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn262">[20]</xref></sup>when G<small>OD</small> your God enlarges your territory, as He has promised you, and you say: ’I will eat meat,’ because your appetite desires to eat meat, you may eat the meat anywhere you desire, <sup><xref rid="fn263">[21]</xref></sup>when the place in which G<small>OD</small> your God will choose to allow His Name to abide, will be too far for you. But you must slaughter your oxen and flocks, which G<small>OD</small> your God has given you, as I have commanded you. Then, you may eat them within your gates, anywhere you desire. <sup>[22]</sup>But you will eat it as the gazelle and deer are eaten; the ritually impure will eat it together with the ritually pure. <sup><xref rid="fn264">[23]</xref></sup>But be resolute not to eat the blood, for the blood is the life; you shall not eat the life with the flesh. <sup>[24]</sup>You must not eat it; pour it out on the ground as water. <sup><xref rid="fn265">[25]</xref></sup>You must not eat it, in order that it may be good for you — you, and your children after you — when you fulfill that which is right before G<small>OD</small>. <sup><xref rid="fn266">[26]</xref></sup>But when you have you consecrated animals and vow-offerings, you must carry and go to the place which G<small>OD</small> will choose; <sup><xref rid="fn267">[27]</xref></sup>You will offer your burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of G<small>OD</small> your God.

<p><sup><xref rid="fn269">[29]</xref></sup>When G<small>OD</small> your God cuts down before you the nations whom you go to dispossess, and after you dispossess them and you dwell in their land, <sup><xref rid="fn270">[30]</xref></sup>be careful lest you be ensnared by them after they have been destroyed from before you, and lest you inquire after their gods, saying: ‘In the way that these nations worshipped their gods, in that same manner will I act’. <sup><xref rid="fn271">[31]</xref></sup> You must not act thus toward G<small>OD</small> your God, for every hated abominable thing to G<small>OD</small> have they practiced toward their gods; they even set fire to their sons and their daughters for their gods. <sup><xref rid="fn272">[13:<small>1</small>]</xref></sup>All these words which I instruct you, you must observe to practice; you must not add to them, nor must you diminish from them.</p>

For G<small>OD</small> your God puts you to the test, to know whether you really love G<small>OD</small> your God with all your heart and with all your soul. <sup><xref rid="fn275">[5]</xref></sup>After G<small>OD</small> your God must you walk, Him must you revere, His commandments must you keep, His voice must you obey, Him must you serve, and to Him must you cleave. <sup><xref rid="fn276">[6]</xref></sup> And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, will be put to death, because he spoke rebellious against G<small>OD</small> your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of slavery — to sidetrack you from the path which G<small>OD</small> your God commanded to walk. You must remove the evil from your midst.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn277">[7]</xref></sup>If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or daughter, or your bosom wife, or your friend whom you love like yourself, entices you secretly saying: ‘Let us go and worship other gods,’ of which you do not know, neither you, nor your fathers; <sup>[8]</sup>from among the gods of the people around you, either near or far away from you, even from one end of the world to the other end of the world, <sup><xref rid="fn278">[9]</xref></sup>do not assent to him, nor accept his words.

<p><sup>[13]</sup>If you should hear tell, that in one of the towns that G<small>OD</small> your God is giving you to dwell in, <sup>[14]</sup>some scoundrels have come out from among you and enticed the inhabitants of their town saying, ‘Let us go and worship other gods,’ which you have not known; <sup><xref rid="fn281">[15]</xref></sup>you must inquire and search and investigate thoroughly. If it be true and the thing is substantiated, that such abomination was done in your midst, <sup>[16]</sup>you must surely strike the inhabitants of that town with the sword. Destroy it utterly and all that is in there, even its cattle, by the sword. <sup><xref rid="fn282">[17]</xref></sup>Gather all its spoil in the midst of its thoroughfare, and burn in fire the city and all its spoil, entirely, for G<small>OD</small> your God, and it must remain a heap for ever, never to be rebuilt. <sup><xref rid="fn283">[18]</xref></sup>Nothing must remain in your possession of the condemned city, in order that G<small>OD</small> may turn from the fierceness of His anger, and grant you mercy, have compassion upon you, and multiply you as He has promised your forefathers, <sup><xref rid="fn284">[19]</xref></sup>for you will follow the voice of G<small>OD</small> your God to keep all His commandments which I instruct you today, to practice what is right before G<small>OD</small> your God.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn285">[14:1]</xref></sup>You are children of G<small>OD</small> your God.

After the death of Aaron — since they used to travel from one encampment to another — a man might offer, e.g., a burnt-offering, in whatever encampment he desired; or, one man might offer the firstborn of his flock, while another man did not so offer — because the obligation in each case is dependent on the land of Israel.

I do not agree with this interpretation. Rather,

Moshe’s meaning is that they were not all completely dedicated to G<small>OD</small>. The reason he can say <b>we</b> [thereby including even himself — Translator] is that there <i>were</i> many commandments concerning, e.g., burnt-offerings, which could not be fulfilled except in the land of Israel (for so it is written [Numbers 15:<small>2</small>]).

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn254"><b>[9] the rest</b> Figuratively, a condition from which their descendants will not stray. The same interpretation can be given to the word “inheritance”. Actually, however, the word <b>rest</b> is to be understood
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn255"><b>[10]</b> in connection with the phrase <b>He grants you tranquility;</b> and the word “inheritance” denotes the time when <b>you will dwell in safety</b>.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn256"><b>[11] the choice of your vows</b> One is obliged to satisfy his vows with the choicest of his animals [Yoma 34b].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn257"><b>[12]</b> Scripture repeats the word <b>you will rejoice</b> [<i>cf</i>. :<small>7</small>], in order to introduce the principle that you must gladden <b>the Levite,</b> because <b>he has no portion</b> as you yourself have.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn258"><b>[13]</b> Scripture repeats the idea of <b>in every place which you deem suitable</b> [<i>cf</i>. :<small>8</small>] in order
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn259"><b>[15]</b> to exclude meat of luxury. Since peace-offerings are holy, and since a ritually impure person who eats holy meat incurs excision, Scripture clarifies that meat of luxury may be eaten by <b>the ritually impure and the ritually pure. like the gazelle and like the deer</b> which are never offered on the Altar — and hence a gazelle’s suet, as well as a deer’s suet, may be eaten (this supports my previous assertion [<i>comment on</i> Leviticus 7:<small>23</small><i>ff</i>.]; but we rely primarily on our ancestral tradition [Ḥullin 117a]).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn260"><b>[17] to eat within your gates the tithe of your grain…</b> Scripture addresses the Levites (and, according to many, also the common Israelites, apropos the <i>second</i> tithe); similarly in the phrase <b>the firstlings of your herd and flock,</b> Scripture addresses the Kohanim. The Levites, as well as the Kohanim, are included among “Israel” in general (as in “I commanded you” [3:<small>18</small>], wherein Moshe addresses only two and one-half tribes). Compare “however, you must redeem…” [Numbers 18:<small>15</small>], which is addressed to all Israel, but which only applies to someone who has a firstborn that he is obliged to redeem. Thus, <b>to eat within your gates…</b>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn261"><b>[18] you may eat it before</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>your God</b> can only apply to someone who is obliged to eat it. ¶ The Dissenters have said that there are <i>two</i> firstborns: 1) the firstborn who “opens the womb” [Exodus 13:<small>12</small>] and 2) the “firstborn of the flock”; but there is no need to reply to their nonsense. Others among them have said that this passage concerns the firstborn [15:<small>22</small>] [Bekhorot 32b] and the tithe [Yevamot 85b<i>ff</i>] that an ordinary Israelite may eat — that it may be eaten <i>even</i> in the “chosen place”. But this is the <i>opposite</i> of what Scripture says!
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn262"><b>[20] because your appetite desires to eat meat</b> i.e., <i>if</i> your appetite desires to eat meat. This law has already been mentioned [:<small>15</small>], but Scripture repeats it here to add the passage

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn267"><b>[27] you may eat the meat</b> Scripture addresses the Kohanim, in the case of a firstling, or a sin-offering, or a guilt-offering. In the case of a peace-offering, only the thigh and the breast are meant, the greater part of it being eaten by an ordinary Israelite.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn268"><b>[28] observe and heed</b> to spill the blood at the side of the Altar.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn269"><b>[29] When He cuts down</b> This passage is connected to the passage “When He enlarges…” [:<small>20</small>] — if they are not victorious over the other nations, then He cannot enlarge the borders.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn270"><b>[30]</b> The word <b>and lest</b> introduces an elliptical construction, as if Scripture had said “and be careful … lest you inquire after their gods, <i>in order to act as they act</i>, saying…”. <b>in that same manner will I act</b> in worshiping G<small>OD</small>, thinking that you thereby do well. However,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn271"><b>[31] you must not act thus,</b> because all of their actions are abhorrent to G<small>OD</small> (as evidenced by the subsequent explanation, <b>they even set fire to their sons…</b>). Rather,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn272"><b>[13:<small>1</small>]</b> you must observe that which I have commanded you.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn273"><b>[2] if a prophet arises among you</b> The meaning of <b>among you</b> is that a prophet must be from the nation of Israel. The common thread connecting this passage with the previous passage is the prohibition against idolatry (the burning of children [12:<small>31</small>] was an idolatrous practice). The word <b>prophet</b> here denotes someone who claims that G<small>OD</small>, or a messenger of G<small>OD</small>, spoke to him while <i>awake</i>. The other possibility is that it occurred in a dream. Some say, that the prophet discussed here is likely one of the “thieves of G<small>OD</small>’s words” [<i>cf</i>. Jeremiah 23:<small>30</small>] — to wit: A true prophet announces that a certain miracle will come, to justify him; someone else overhears this, and then asserts that the miracle applies to <i>himself</i>. Others say, that we do not believe him, even if the signal or marvel comes to pass, because he says things that are contrary to logic. In my opinion, the Hebrew words <b>signal</b> and <b>marvel</b> here have the sense of “sign” [and not any supernatural event — Translator]:
1) The words of Isaiah provide evidence for this interpretation. He said “Behold, I, and the children whom G<small>OD</small> has given me, are for signs and for portents” [Isaiah 8:<small>18</small>] (the prophet’s own sign was “…just as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot…” [Isaiah 20:<small>3</small>]; the sons’ signs were their names, each being named after an event which was to occur in his lifetime, i.e., “Immanu<sup>כ</sup>el” [Isaiah 7:<small>14</small>], “Maher-Shalal-Ḥash-Baz” [Isaiah 8:<small>3</small>], and “Sh<sup>әכ</sup>ar-Yashuv” [Isaiah 7:<small>3</small>]).
2) With respect to plagues, Scripture says “They will serve you as signs and proofs” [28:<small>46</small>].
Many similar examples exist.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn276"><b>[6] he spoke rebellious</b> i.e., he spoke rebellious <i>words</i>. Compare, “in the multitude of counsellors, [counsel] is established” [Proverbs 15:<small>22</small>]. The derivation of the Hebrew word <b>rebellious</b> [Hebrew: <i>sarah</i>] could be that he turned away [Hebrew: <i>sarah</i>] from G<small>OD</small> Who commanded us to turn away from idol-worship, or it comes from “insubordinate [Hebrew: <i>sorer</i>] and rebellious” [21:<small>18</small>] — and the latter etymology is correct (it would thus be appropriate for the <i>resh</i> to be vocalized with a <i>dagesh</i>). ¶ Scripture repeats the sense of <b>Who brought you out</b> in <b>redeemed you,</b> for the sake of emphasis.

The person to whom one sells it may either be a stranger who does not dwell in the land, or he may have the status that I have explained [<i>see comment on</i> Exodus 22:<small>20</small>]. Because this passage concerns meat, it is connected to the passage <b>you must not cook a kid…,</b> as I have previously explained [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 23:<small>19</small>; the reference is to an earlier commentary on Exodus, known as the <i>Perush Haqqaṣar</i> — Translator]. This passage, in turn, is connected to the passage
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn296"><b>[22] You must set aside the tithe</b> because Scripture has informed us that one may not eat a ritually impure bird, nor a ritually impure beast, nor a beast that has died by itself — thereby concluding the discussion of <i>meat</i>. With respect to <i>grain</i>, on the other hand, there is a consecrated portion which may not be eaten except in the appropriate place. ¶ The Spaniard Rabbi Y<sup>ә</sup>hudah HaLevy — may he be for us a light from above!<xref rid="fn332"><sup>1</sup></xref> — has said that the phrase <b>which the field goes out year after year</b> modifies the word <b>seed</b> (and thus denotes the seed that one takes out into the field). In my opinion, the meaning is more straightforward: it denotes the <i>produce</i> that the field brings forth. If you should object that Scripture uses the term “goes out”, which is an intransitive verb, I shall show you “the city that brought forth [literally: went forth] one thousand, shall have one hundred left” [Amos 5:<small>3</small>] in which the verb “shall have left [<i>singular</i>]” is definitive proof of the other verb’s transitivity. ¶ Our Sages, of blessed memory, have asserted [<i>Sifrey</i> on this verse] that this verse describes the Second Tithe. Understand that if you count upward, you begin with One; if you count downward, you begin with Ten. This is the mystery of the first-born, and of the tithe [<i>cf. comment on</i> Leviticus 27:<small>32</small><i>ff</i>.]. Understand that the number One is in a class by itself. So is the number Ten (which corresponds to the number One), because it is both the beginning of the tens, and the end of the units. All the other unary numbers are contained within them, between one and the other. Because One and Ten are the fundamental quantities, they and the numbers midway between them — i.e., Five and Six — are called “round numbers”. Accordingly, the silent letters in the Hebrew alphabet [’<i>alef, heh, vav</i>, and <i>yod</i> — Translator] are those that correspond to these four quantities; and among them are the letters that form the Glorious and Awesome Name [<i>cf. comment on</i> Exodus 3:<small>15</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn297"><b>[23] …the firstlings of your oxen</b> i.e., <i>he who is fit to eat them</i> will eat them, as I have explained [<i>comment on</i> 12:<small>17</small>]. The obvious meaning of <b>in order that you learn</b> is: When you are staying in the holy place, they will teach you. But a non-obvious meaning is in the sense of “a well-broken heifer” [Hosea 10:<small>11</small>], meaning “you will become accustomed to”. I believe that the latter interpretation is the correct one. The <b>tithe</b> mentioned here is the object of the verb
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn298"><b>[25] you may exchange.</b> The word <b>in your hand</b> means, entrusted into your hands.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn299"><b>[26] or alchoholic beverage</b> made from honey, or from dates, or from wheat, or from barley. <b>whatever your heart desires</b> e.g., fruit. <b>you and your household</b> you and your sons are <i>obliged</i>, whereas the rest of your household are <i>permitted</i>. The commandment to observe the three festivals is binding only upon males [Exodus 23:<small>17</small>]; but those women will be rewarded who, like the wives of <sup>כ</sup>Elqanah, [I Samuel 1:<small>3</small><i>ff</i>.], go on pilgrimage to the appointed place.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn300"><b>[27] the Levite who resides within your gates</b> denotes any member of the Tribe of Levi. You will be rewarded if you do not forsake them, but rather, if you give them commensurate to what you can afford. The most plausible interpretation is that Scripture is discussing the <i>first</i> tithe. Having just mentioned the second tithe, Scripture now says: Do not think that you fulfill your duty with only the second tithe. <b>within your gates</b> The first tithe should be given to him who resides within your gates. One should not say, “Since he will always be with me, I shall send this to a different Levite”, or “I have already given to him”.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn301"><b>[28]</b> The passage <b>at the boundary of three years</b> discusses the Pauper’s Tithe. During this year, one should not set apart the Second Tithe [Rosh HaShana 12b]. Some say, though, that one should set apart all three tithes. The Dissenters assert that the passage “you must set aside…” [:<small>22</small>] denotes the <i>first</i> tithe (and that the passage “take the money in your hand…” [:<small>22</small>] is addressed to the Levites, just as the phrase “the firstlings of your herds” [:<small>23</small>] is addressed to the Kohanim), and that there is a second tithe only every three years, known as the Pauper’s Tithe — but we shall rely on our ancestral tradition. <b>boundary</b> here denotes the <i>beginning</i>. Similarly,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn302"><b>[15:<small>1</small>] At the boundary of seven years you will arrange a release</b> denotes the <i>beginning</i> of the year, as is corroborated by the passage of “assemble the people” [31:<small>12</small>]. The passage is connected to the previous one because, having mentioned that the Pauper’s Tithe belongs to the Levite, and the alien, and the orphan, and the widow [<i>cf</i>. 14:<small>29</small>], it is now logical to discuss the general release. <b>release</b> [Hebrew: <i>shmiṭṭah</i>] from “drop her” [Hebrew: <i>shimṭuhah</i>] [II Kings 9:<small>33</small>]: i.e., they released her, and she fell.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn303"><b>[2]</b> The word <b>debt</b> [Hebrew: <i>masheh</i>] has the same form as the word “staff’ [Hebrew: <i>maṭṭeh</i>], and in my opinion is a noun (according to many, however, it is a verb [meaning “lending” — Translator]). The word <b>possessor</b> is here used in the same sense as in “wisdom preserves the lives of them that have it” [Ecclesiastes 7:<small>12</small>], or “takes away the life of its owners” [Proverbs 1:<small>19</small>], denoting the person to whom something belongs. <b>hold</b> is a transitive verb; the borrower is said to be “beholden to”. <b>press</b> [Hebrew: <i>yiggos̀</i>] i.e., “oppress”, as in “you exact [Hebrew: <i>tingos̀u</i>] all your payments” [Isaiah 58:<small>3</small>] (in which one can see the <i>nun</i>, which normally disappears in the future form of a <i>peh-nun</i> verb). <b>a release to</b> G<small>OD</small> i.e., <i>in honor of</i> G<small>OD</small>, Who has given the creditor wealth. The association here with G<small>OD</small> is due to the earlier statement “it is the Sabbath of G<small>OD</small>” [Leviticus 25:<small>2</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn304"><b>[3] You may press the foreigner for payment</b> i.e., it is <i>permissible</i>.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn305"><b>[4] However…</b> The sense of this passage is: Know that there might be no need for that which I have commanded you concerning not pressing your brother for payment; for there will be no one among you in need of your lending to him

Indeed, as long as you remain upright, you will rule over them. Nevertheless, the command <i>does</i> apply
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn308"><b>[7] If there be among you a needy man.</b> Accordingly, Scripture informs us that “the needy will not be absent in the midst of your land” [:<small>11</small>]; He knew that the generation would come in which the majority of people are not innocent. <b>do not toughen your heart</b> You must speak kind words to him. <b>shut</b> means “to close”<xref rid="fn333"><sup>1</sup></xref> when the verb is in the <i>qal</i> form. <b>needy</b> [Hebrew: <sup>⊃</sup><i>evyon</i>] Some say that the word is related to “he did not want [Hebrew: <sup>⊃</sup><i>avah</i>] to let them go” [Exodus 10:<small>27</small>] (thereby attributing to it the same form as is shown by the Hebrew words “lofty [Hebrew: <sup>⊂</sup><i>elyon</i>]”, “hideaway [Hebrew: <i>ḥevyon</i>]”, and “logic [Hebrew: <i>higgayon</i>]”, whose triliteral roots are <sup>⊂</sup>-l-h, ḥ-v-h, and h-g-h, respectively), denoting one who is <i>in want</i> of everything, due to his great need.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn309"><b>[8] You must open</b> employs a verbal noun. ¶ In fact, every verb that is not preceded by the verbal noun is in reality an elliptical construct. But the homiletical explanation [Bava Meṣi‘a 31b] [that it applies to the poor of other cities as well as to of one’s own — Translator] is also attractive. <b>open your hand to him</b> applies to someone who has nothing, as opposed to <b>you must secure a loan to him</b> — you must give him of yours, in exchange for his collateral (the verb “secure a loan” means “take in exchange for a security”).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn310"><b>[9]</b> The word <b>base</b> [Hebrew: <i>bliyya</i><sup>⊂</sup><i>al</i>] is a noun. Some say, however, that it is a compound word, suggestive of a prayer that does not ascend [Hebrew: <i>ya</i><sup>⊂</sup><i>al</i>], nor increase, nor endure. <b>your eye be mean</b> employs an <i>‘ayin-vav</i> verb, of the same form as “she returns to her father’s house” [Leviticus 22:<small>13</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn311"><b>[10] on account of</b> [literally: “in rolling over”] i.e., “for the reason of” [literally: “in turning over”]. Compare “to turn this matter the other way” [II Samuel 14:<small>20</small>]. ¶ The reason behind this verse’s assertion is that all of our individual bodies are nothing more than parts of an integrated Whole. <b>give, give</b> indicating that if you give to him, G<small>OD</small> will then increase your possessions.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn312"><b>[11]</b> I have already explained <b>the needy will not be absent in the midst of your land</b> [<i>comment on</i> 15:<small>7</small>]. You must first give to <b>your brother</b> (i.e., your blood relative), before giving to <b>your poor</b> (i.e., the poor in your family); and the needy of <b>your land</b> have precedence over the needy of another land. The common theme which connects this passage
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn313"><b>[12]</b> with the passage <b>If your Hebrew brother be sold to you</b> is the idea of “supply him with a bonus” [:<small>14</small>]. I have already defined the term <b>Hebrew brother</b> [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 21:<small>2</small>]. <b>or female</b> The case is when a man sells his daughter to be a maidservant [<i>Mekhilta</i> on Exodus 21:<small>7</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn314"><b>[13]</b> I have already explained the word <b>empty</b> [<i>comment on</i> Genesis 31:<small>42</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn315"><b>[14] supply with a bonus</b> [Hebrew: <i>ha</i><sup>⊂</sup><i>neyq ta</i><sup>⊂</sup><i>niq</i>] You must behave beautifully toward him, from “a necklace [Hebrew: <sup>⊂<i>ɒ</i></sup><i>naqim</i>] about your neck” [Proverbs 1:<small>9</small>]. Or, it could be that the word has no cognate, and that its meaning must be deduced entirely from context.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn316"><b>[17]</b> I have already given the reason for piercing <b>his ear at the door</b> [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 21:<small>6</small>]. The reason Scripture mentions this again is that you owe him a debt when he goes free; but, if he does not want to go, you must pierce his ear instead. <b>So shall you do even to your maid-servant</b> refers back to “supply him with a bonus” [: <small>14</small>] (even though it is remote — compare the antecedents of “He must make restitution; if he has nothing wherewith to pay…” [Exodus 22:<small>2</small>], “if these three…” [Exodus 21:<small>11</small>], and many others [<i>see also comment on</i> Leviticus 19:<small>25</small>]), because a woman’s ear is not pierced [Qiddushin 17b].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn317"><b>[18] you must not begrudge…</b> We find the verse “three years, as the years of a hireling” [Isaiah 16:<small>14</small>] from which we learn that a man is not permitted to hire himself out for more than three years. This principle applies in equal force to the employer (that is, he who pays his wage). Thus, the word “twice” denotes “double” (as it does in “there will be twice” [Exodus 16:<small>5</small>]), when the word serves as a noun. On the other hand, when the same word appears in such phrases as “second to the king” [Esther 10:<small>3</small>] the word functions as an adjective. It comes from the word “two”, as I have explained [<i>comment on</i> Esther 10:<small>3</small>]. Scripture thus clarifies here that the phrase “at the seventh year he shall go out free, without paying” [Exodus 21:<small>2</small>] denotes the <i>beginning</i> of the seventh year. Further proof could be brought from the case of the Sabbatical year, or even from the case of the Sabbath day. The word <b>will bless you</b> denotes the future, not the past. When a <i>vav</i> precedes a verb beginning with a labial consonant, there is no way to distinguish between the two tenses, so the meaning must be known from context.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn318"><b>[19]</b> The common theme which connects the passage of <b>all the firstling males</b> to the previous passage is <b>you must not do any work with the firstlings of your ox.</b>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn319"><b>[20] You must eat</b> As I have explained [<i>comment on</i> 12:<small>17</small>], Scripture addresses only him who is fit to eat it. Thus, <b>you and your family</b> denotes the family of the kohen. This law is here stated for the second time, in order to mention
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn320"><b>[21]</b> the treatment of a blemished animal. <b>any serious defect</b> which have been enumerated [Leviticus 22:<small>22</small><i>ff</i>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn321"><b>[22] You may eat it within your gates</b> Some say that the <i>kohen</i> may eat it outside of the Sanctuary. Others assert that, since it is defective, it belongs to the Israelite — but, in my opinion, this is farfetched [the <i>halakha</i> [Bekhorot 33a] is that a common Israelite <i>may</i> eat a defective firstling, once he has acquired it from the kohen — Translator]. <b>ritually impure and ritually pure</b> refers to <b>you may eat it.</b> The <i>heh</i> in both words carries the vocative meaning, as if to say, “you, whether ritually impure or ritually pure”. In other words, he is permitted to eat it whether he is ritually pure or not. This is mentioned because normally someone who eats holy meat while ritually impure incurs the penalty of <i>karet</i>.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn322"><b>[16:<small>1</small>]</b> Since the previous passage contained the law of “annually” [15:<small>20</small>], Scripture now mentions the laws of “three times a year” [:<small>16</small>]. Another connection is that a firstling must be eaten in the Sanctuary, and likewise the Paschal sacrifice may only be eaten during the existence of the Sanctuary, and not outside of it. <b>the month of Spring</b> is so called because it was during the Springtime that they left Egypt. The Dissenters have claimed that one may not perform the Paschal sacrifice until Spring-time. I have replied to their nonsense elsewhere [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 12:<small>2</small>] (nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the court <i>did</i> examine whether or not Spring had arrived). ¶ Know that in the Hebrew language the months have no proper names. The names that appear in Scripture — like <i>Nisan</i> [Esther 3:<small>7</small>], <i>Sivan</i> [Esther 8:<small>9</small>], <i>Kislev</i> [Nehemiah 1:<small>1</small>], <i>Ṭevet</i> [Esther 2:<small>16</small>], and <sup>⊃</sup><i>Adar</i> [Esther 3:<small>7</small>] — are all Aramaic. Consequently, Scripture had to tell us, “…this being the month of Nisan” [Esther 3:<small>7</small>]. The only Hebrew terms that we find are the descriptive terms “Splendor” [I Kings 6:<small>1</small>], “Mighty” [I Kings 8:<small>2</small>], and “Wilt” [I Kings 6:<small>38</small>]. ¶ The original rule was that the first month (the month from which the others are counted) was to be reckoned with the coming of the Spring — whether the previous year had twelve or thirteen months being of no concern. However, our ancestors, of blessed memory, added other considerations, in addition to the Spring [Sanhedrin 11b]; and all of their words are true. <b>at night</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>brought you out</b> from under the <i>authority</i> of Pharaoh, and they left shortly afterward, as I have explained at greater length [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 12:<small>31</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn323"><b>[2] flock</b> for the fulfillment of the Paschal sacrifice, and <b>oxen</b> for the festival peace-offerings. Corroborating evidence is found in “…and three thousand bullocks” [II Chronicles 35:<small>7</small>] after Scripture had already stated “…and for the paschal offerings,” [<i>ibid</i>.] regarding the lambs and kids. Moreover, “five thousand” animals for paschal offerings, <i>in addition to</i> “five hundred oxen” [II Chronicles 35:<small>9</small>], were given to the Levites. Here, too, Scripture first mentions the paschal offering, before mentioning the cattle. Compare, “you, and your household” [14:<small>26</small>].<xref rid="fn334"><sup>1</sup></xref>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn324"><b>[3] you must not eat leaven on it</b> meaning, no leaven may remain <i>at the time when</i> one may slaughter the Paschal offering [Pesaḥim 28b]. <b>bread of affliction</b> as a remembrance. <b>all the days of your life</b> i.e., every year.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn325"><b>[4] which you offer on the eve</b> This denotes the meat of the Paschal offering.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn326"><b>[6]</b> I have already explained the term <b>toward evening, at sunset</b> [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 12:<small>6</small>]. The phrase <b>at the time when you went out of Egypt</b> refers back to <b>the Paschal sacrifice,</b> <i>not</i> to <b>toward evening, at sunset</b> — for they went out of Egypt during the Springtime month.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn327"><b>[7]</b> As I have explained [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 12:<small>9</small>], the word <b>you will cook</b> here denotes roasting. Compare, “they cooked the Paschal sacrifice in fire” [II Chronicles 35:<small>13</small>]. Scriptures says <b>you will cook</b> only to indicate that it must not be eaten raw. <b>in the morning you may return</b> The Dissenters have said that one may return home to one’s land on the holiday. But we must not rely on our own understanding when deriving the Commandments — rather, we must rely on the Exegetes of the Torah. Indeed, although we do find “on the eighth day he dismissed the people” [I Kings 8:<small>66</small>] — which was clearly a holiday — we see written elsewhere “on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he dismissed the people” [II Chronicles 7:<small>10</small>]. Some say that the word “to their tents” in the former verse denotes their <i>temporary</i> tents, and that they did not return to their land until the workday. Similarly in this verse, <b>you may return to your tents</b> denotes the tents just outside of Jerusalem. They left for their land on the workday.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn328"><b>[8]</b> Our ancestors have said [Menaḥot 66a] that the <b>six days</b> are to be counted “from when the first standing grain is reaped” [:<small>9</small>]. It is also plausible that <b>the seventh day</b> is to be added on to the <b>six days,</b> in which case Scripture distinguishes between the beginning and the end of the festival in order to admonish <b>you must not do work.</b> Note that Scripture did not say <i>“any</i> work” [e.g., Exodus 20:<small>10</small>], because here the meaning is “any servile work” [e.g., Leviticus 23:<small>7</small>] (in the one place where “any work” is used in this context it is immediately qualified by “except…” [Exodus 12:<small>16</small>]). Since Scripture has mentioned Passover, during which one is required to visit the Sanctuary,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn329"><b>[9]</b> Scripture then proceeds to discuss the second and the third holidays. Thus Scripture does not here mention the New Year, nor Yom Kippur, because on those days the congregation does not gather together in the Sanctuary.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn330"><b>[10]</b> The letter <i>samekh</i> in the word <b>tribute</b> [Hebrew: <i>missat</i>] is vocalized with a <i>dagesh</i> to indicate the absorption of a <i>nun</i>; the word comes from “flag” [Hebrew: <i>nes</i>], in the sense of “raising up one’s arm”, <b>a freewill offering of your arm</b> denotes burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn331"><b>[12] you must remember that you were a slave…</b> follows from the earlier mention of “…your man-servant and your maid-servant” [:<small>11</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn332"><sup>1</sup>[This honorific is used several subsequent times when mentioning Y<sup>ә</sup>hudah HaLevy, and it is never used by ibn Ezra to describe anyone other than Y<sup>ә</sup>hudah HaLevy.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn333"><sup>1</sup>Compare, “shuts her mouth” [Job 5:<small>16</small>], “in anger He stopped up [His mercies]” [Psalms 77:<small>10</small>], and “kings shall shut their mouths” [Isaiah 52:<small>15</small>]

<p><sup><xref rid="fn362">[18:1]</xref></sup>The Levite priests and the whole tribe of Levi, will have no portion nor allotment with Israel; they shell eat the sacrifices of G<small>OD</small>, and His allotment. <sup>[2]</sup>He will have no allotment among their brethren; G<small>OD</small> will be his allotment, as He promised him.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn363">[3]</xref></sup>This will be the priest’s allowance from the people; from them who slaughter an animal, whether an ox or a lamb — he must give to the kohen the shoulder, the cheeks, and the stomach. <sup>[4]</sup>The first product of your grain, your oil, and your wine; and the first of the fleece of your sheep must you give to him. <sup>[5]</sup>For G<small>OD</small> your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, to stand and to minister in the name of G<small>OD</small>, he and his descendants forever.</p>

<p><sup>[19:1]</sup>When G<small>OD</small> your God has annihilated the nations whose land G<small>OD</small> your God is giving you, and you have dispossessed them and dwell in their cities and houses, <sup>[2]</sup>you must designate three cities in the midst of your land, which G<small>OD</small> your God give you to possess. <sup><xref rid="fn375">[19:3]</xref></sup>You will prepare the road, and apportion into three the border of the territory which G<small>OD</small> your God will bequeath to you, and it will be for every manslayer to flee there. <sup>[4]</sup>This is the rule for the manslayer who may flee there and live: one who smites his fellowman unintentionally, and was not his enemy in the past. <sup><xref rid="fn376">[5]</xref></sup>A man who goes into the forest with his fellowman to chop trees, and his hand strays along the ax to cut the wood. Drops the blade off the wood, and it finds his fellowman so that he dies; he may escape to one of these cities and stay alive. <sup><xref rid="fn377">[6]</xref></sup>For if the distance is too far, the avenger of blood may pursue the manslayer, while his anger is still hot, reach him and strike him mortally, yet there is no death sentence against him, since he was not his enemy in the past. <sup>[7]</sup>Therefore I command you and say: you must designate three cities for yourselves. <sup><xref rid="fn378">[8]</xref></sup>And if G<small>OD</small> your God enlarges your borders, as He promised to your forefathers, and gives you all the land that He said he would give to your forefathers — <sup><xref rid="fn379">[9]</xref></sup>if you observe to practice this entire commandment which I command you today: to love G<small>OD</small> your God, and ever to walk in His ways — then you must set aside three cities in addition those three. <sup>[10]</sup> Thus innocent blood will not be shed, and the blood be upon you, in the midst of your land which G<small>OD</small> your God gives you for an inheritance.</p>
<p><sup>[11]</sup>But if any enemy to his fellowman hides in ambush, and then arises and strikes him mortally so that he dies from it, and he escapes to one of these cities; <sup>[12]</sup>the elders of his city must send to take him out from there, and hand him over to the blood avenger, that he may die. <sup>[13]</sup>You must not spare him; you must eliminate the innocent blood from Israel, and it will be well with you.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn380">[14]</xref></sup>Do not remove your neighbor’s boundary, which the primogenitors have bounded in your allotment, and which you will inherit in the land that G<small>OD</small> your God gives you to possess.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn381">[15]</xref></sup>One witness shall not stand against a man for any guilt, or any liability, or any sin which he commits; only on the testimony of two witnesses or on the testimony of three witnesses will a matter be decided. <sup><xref rid="fn382">[16]</xref></sup>If malicious witnesses stand up against a man, to accuse him rebellious, <sup>[17]</sup>the two parties who are involved in the litigation, must stand before G<small>OD</small>: before the priests or the judges who will be in those days, <sup><xref rid="fn383">[18]</xref></sup>and the judges must make a thorough inquiry; and if a witness gave false testimony, falsely chastising against his brother, <sup>[19]</sup> you must execute upon him whatever he plotted against his fellowman, and you will remove the evil from your midst. <sup>[20]</sup>The others will hear and fear and repeat no more the doing of this evil thing in your midst. <sup><xref rid="fn384">[21]</xref></sup>You must not show mercy; life for life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, an arm for an arm, a leg for a leg.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn385">[20:1]</xref></sup>When you go out in war against your enemies, and see horses and chariots, an army greater than yours, you must not be afraid of them; for G<small>OD</small> your God, Who brought you forth from the land of Egypt, is with you. <sup><xref rid="fn386">[2]</xref></sup>When you near the battle, the kohen will come forward and speak to the people. <sup><xref rid="fn387">[3]</xref></sup>He will call out to them: ‘Hear O Israel.

<p><sup><xref rid="fn393">[10]</xref></sup>When you approach to attack a city, you must first offer it peace. <sup>[11]</sup>In the event they accept your peace offer, and open for you, all the people who are found there will become tribute to you and serve you. <sup><xref rid="fn394">[12]</xref></sup>If they do not propitiate you, but make war against you, then you will besiege it, <sup>[13]</sup>and when G<small>OD</small> your God delivers it into your hand, you will slay all its males by the edge of the sword. <sup>[14]</sup>But the women, the children, the cattle, and all the spoil that is there — you may take as booty for you, and you may eat the spoils of your enemy which G<small>OD</small> your God has given you. <sup><xref rid="fn395">[15]</xref></sup>Thus will you act in regard to all the cities that are far off from you, which are not of the cities that belong to those nations. <sup><xref rid="fn396">[16]</xref></sup>However, as for the cities of those people which G<small>OD</small> your God gives you for an inheritance, you must not spare any soul, <sup><xref rid="fn397">[17]</xref></sup>you must utterly destroy them — the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, as G<small>OD</small> your God commanded you, <sup>[18]</sup>so that they will not teach you to do all their abhorrent things whereby they served their gods, and you thus sin against G<small>OD</small> your God.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn398">[19]</xref></sup>When you besiege a city a long time, in making war to capture it, you must not destroy her trees by thrusting an ax against them. You may eat of them, but do not cut them down, for man is a tree of the field, to come before you in the siege. <sup><xref rid="fn399">[20]</xref></sup>Only trees which you know do not produce food may you uproot and cut to build up siegeworks against the city with which you are engaged in war, until it is brought low.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn400">[21:1]</xref></sup>If a corpse is found fallen on the ground in the land which G<small>OD</small> your God gives you to possess, and it is not known who killed him, <sup><xref rid="fn401">[2]</xref></sup>your elders and judges will come forth, and measure the distance between the surrounding towns and the slain. <sup><xref rid="fn402">[3]</xref></sup>The elders of the town nearest to the corpse shall then take a heifer out of the herd, which was not yet used, and which was not yet drawn in the yoke. <sup><xref rid="fn403">[4]</xref></sup>and the elders of that town will bring the heifer down to an uncultivated valley, which shall never be worked nor sown.

Scripture adds <b>all your crops</b>, to specify that the blessing refers to the crops that the land has produced, and <b>your undertakings</b> refers to commerce, and the professions. <b>you will be only happy</b> There is a special commandment to rejoice on the festival of Sukkot.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn338"><b>[18]</b> Even though every individual commandment stands on its own, nevertheless conjecture may be offered concerned their ordering and juxtaposition.

for emphasis.

Scripture addresses those who are entering the land in the phrase <b>so that you may live;</b> and Scripture addresses their descendants in the phrase <b>and inherit</b> (meaning, that the inheritance will <i>endure</i>).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn341"><b>[21]</b> The first cases that the judges must examine will be those involving the most widespread forms of idolatry. <b>You must not plant for yourself an <sup>⊃</sup><i>asherah</i></b> for this was an idolatrous practice (as in “…in the gardens, behind one in the interior” [Isaiah 66:<small>17</small>]).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn342"><b>[22] You may not put up a monolith</b> for idolatry, as evidenced in the qualifier <b>which He detests.</b> But a monolith that is not idolatrous in nature is permitted [the <i>halakha</i> [<i>cf. Sifrey</i> on this verse] is that a monolith is <i>always</i> a forbidden form of worship — Translator], conclusive evidence being found in the <i>parasha</i> of <i>Vayyishlaḥ</i> [Genesis 35:<small>14</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn343"><b>[17:<small>1</small>] You must not offer to G<small>OD</small> your God</b> Since Scripture has mentioned the prohibitions of the <sup>⊃</sup><i>asherah</i>, and the monolith, Scripture now states that it is also prohibited to sacrifice anything blemished to G<small>OD</small>. <b>any repugnant thing</b> is the explication of the term <b>blemish. abhorrent</b> in the sense of “offer it to your prefect” [Malachi 1:<small>8</small>], because to offer such a sacrifice is a punishable offense, whereas no punishment falls to one who <i>fails</i> to offer a sacrifice (except for the obligatory ones).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn344"><b>[2] If there be found among you …</b> After mentioning the case of an <sup>⊃</sup><i>asherah</i> near the altar — something which is out in the open, in plain sight of everyone — Scripture now turns to admonish us concerning a private individual who commits idolatry. <b>breaking</b> a <b>covenant</b> means the opposite of fulfilling it.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn345"><b>[3]</b> The grammatical properties of the word <b>worshiped</b> are discussed in my book <i>Sefer Hayy<sup>ǝ</sup>sod.</i> <b>other gods</b> denotes man-made idols, as opposed to <b>the sun, or the moon,</b> or the <b>heavenly bodies,</b> which are the handiwork of God. <b>which I commanded you not to</b> i.e., I commanded you not to worship them, even though they are My creations.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn346"><b>[4] investigate well</b> here means <i>intensely</i> (as in “I am greatly angry” [Jonah 4:<small>9</small>]). The word <b>well</b> is closely related to the Hebrew word for “good”.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn347"><b>[5] stone them</b> that is, the man, or the woman, whichever the case may be. Compare “they will burn him and them” [Leviticus 20:<small>14</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn348"><b>[6]</b> Having mentioned the two possibilities “it be reported to you” [:<small>3</small>] (i.e., secretly) and “you hear it” [:<small>3</small>] (i.e., publicly), Scripture must now clarify that though it may have been reported to you, and you may have heard it, one is nevertheless not put to death except by the testimony of two witnesses.<sup><xref rid="fn409">1</xref></sup> <b>or three witnesses</b> Sa‘adya Gaon interprets the passage to read “three (people who accept the testimony of the) witnesses”. Some say that if two witnesses contradict two other witnesses, then a third party can reconcile the conflicting testimony, whether it lead to a conviction or to an acquittal. Others say “two witnesses” if they be scholars, but “three witnesses” otherwise. Thus you see that we require, perforce, the words of the Tradition [Makkot 5b].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn349"><b>[7] the hand of the witnesses</b> that is, the hand of <i>every one</i> of the witnesses. Compare, “the heart of the people melted” [Joshua 7:<small>5</small>], and many similar instances. I have already explained the word <b>eliminate</b> [<i>comment on</i> Numbers 24:<small>22</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn350"><b>[8] Should something be too difficult for you</b> Scripture here addresses the judge. The sense of the verse is: “If it be still hard to decide, after receiving the testimony of the two witnesses, whether to execute the accused…” (this is the meaning of <b>between blood and blood:</b> to decide whether the execution would be an act of innocent bloodshed, or culpable bloodshed). The word <b>difficult</b> appears also in the phrase “is anything too difficult for G<small>OD</small>?” [Genesis 18:<small>14</small>], where it is explained [<i>comment on</i> Genesis 18:<small>14</small>]. <b>between judgment and judgment</b> monetary matters. <b>between injury and injury</b> cases of wounding and battery. <b>Controversial matters</b> is the inclusive category.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn351"><b>[9] I</b> have already explained [<i>commentary on</i> Numbers 16:<small>1</small>] concerning <b>the Levite priests</b> that there can be priests who are not of Levite extraction. <b>the magistrate</b> here denotes the king, who has written a copy of the Torah under the kohanim’s instruction [<i>cf.</i> :<small>18</small>]. <b>to the magistrate</b> to wherever he may be.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn355"><b>[14]</b> Having mentioned the sovereign [<i>comment on</i> :<small>9</small>], Scripture now lists the laws that he is obliged to keep.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn356"><b>[15] you shall set</b> i.e., it is <i>permissible</i> [the <i>halakha</i> [Sanhedrin 20b] is that it is <i>mandatory</i> — Translator] to do so, so long as the monarch is chosen by a prophet, or through the use of the <sup>⊃</sup>Urim — the point being that you yourselves may not choose the king. <b>you cannot</b> (i.e., you <i>may</i> not) enthrone your brother if he be not an Israelite (e.g., an Edomite, even though he is called “your brother” [23:<small>8</small>]).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn357"><b>[16]</b> The reason for the law about the horses is that in those times horses were imported from Egypt. The evidence is the passage “a chariot going out of Egypt…” [I Kings 10:<small>29</small>], which occurred during Solomonic times. Because of Solomon’s need for their horses, he caused the people to sin and to return to Egypt. Obviously, it is a disgrace to return to Egypt after G<small>OD</small> has redeemed us from there (Uriah the prophet fled there only because his life was in danger [Jeremiah 26:<small>21</small>]; and Jeremiah went there against his will [Jeremiah 43:<small>5-7</small>]). <b>you will not again</b> This had been given as a commandment, even though it was not recorded. Some people explain this to refer to “you will never again…” [Exodus 14:<small>13</small>], but the latter verse was not spoken in the sense of a commandment.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn358"><b>[17] that his heart not turn</b> in the pursuit of his lusts. <b>nor may he amass silver and gold</b> so as not to overtax the people. Consider Solomon, who made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone [I Kings 10:<small>27</small>] through his great love of opulence. The Israelites complained about him, saying “your father made our yoke heavy” [I Kings 12:<small>10</small>]. Some people assert, incorrectly, that this complaint was about the construction levies. However, foreigners built the Temple (for so it is written [II Chronicles 2:<small>17</small>]). Note, too, that when Solomon died, Adoniram the tax-collector was stoned to death [I Kings 12:<small>18</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn359"><b>[18] When he is seated</b> at the beginning of his reign. <b>a copy</b> [Hebrew: <i>mishneh</i>] from “duplicate” [Hebrew: <i>shenit</i>].

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn361"><b>[20] that he may not be haughty</b> which would occur, if he were above the law. <b>that he may not turn away</b> for if he did not study, he would not know the law. His reward will be <b>that he lengthen the days</b>.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn362"><b>[18:<small>1</small>] the Levite priests</b> Having mentioned the regulations pertaining to the sovereign, who is the Chief Justice, Scripture now mentions certain ordinances concerning the priests, who are the teachers of the Law. And, since they have no land allotted to them,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn363"><b>[3]</b> they shall take from every sacrifice <b>the shoulder, the cheeks, and the stomach. The shoulder</b> — from the body; <b>the cheeks</b> (including the tongue) — from the head; and <b>the stomach</b> — from the internal organs. There is a homiletical explanation, based on the fact that the kohanim slaughter the peace-offerings [the <i>halakha</i> [Zevaḥim 31b] is that a non-kohen may slaughter the sacrifice — Translator], which depicts the <b>shoulder</b> as the reward for the slaughtering, which is done with one’s arm; the <b>cheeks</b> are the reward for the recitation of the benediction; and the <b>stomach</b> is the reward for the inspection of the internal organs. But the straightforward meaning is that these are the choicest cuts of meat.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn364"><b>[6]</b> Scripture also mentions the matter of the Levite, because he is a teacher of the Torah as well, in the provinces. This is evident from Chronicles [II Chronicles 17:<small>7<i>ff</i></small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn365"><b>[8] except for his patrimony</b> [Hebrew: <i>mimkarav</i>] Some people relate this word to “of your acquaintances [Hebrew: <i>makkareykhem</i>]” [II Kings 12:<small>8</small>], but this is extremely far-fetched, and does not conform to the laws of grammar. Rather, it is related to “if you sell a commodity [Hebrew: <i>mimkar</i>]” [Leviticus 25:<small>14</small>], — meaning, if he sells his hereditary estate (as it is written: “the sale [Hebrew: <i>mimkar</i>] of a house, and a city of his holding, expires…” [Leviticus 25:<small>33</small>]). This, then, is the meaning of <b>patrimony,</b> that you should not say: You have your own, and you may not eat any more. Rather, <b>they will eat an equal share.</b>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn366"><b>[9]</b> After concluding the discussion of the magistrate, and the priest, Scripture now mentions the role of the prophet.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn367"><b>[10] passes his son…</b> This was a form of idolatry. Even nowadays, there are among us many sects who worship fire. <b>a diviner of objects</b> This is in all likelihood a general term, denoting anyone who predicts the future with certainty, saying, “such-and-such a thing will be”, similar in meaning to “soothsayers” [Daniel 2:<small>27</small>], and related to “a divine sentence is in the lips of the king” [Proverbs 16:<small>10</small>] (the specific terms follow: a <b>diviner of auspicious times,</b> a <b>diviner of omens,</b> and a <b>sorcerer</b>). Another possibility is that the term denotes a specific form of “scanners of heaven” [Isaiah 47:<small>13</small>]: one who knows the rules for distinguishing between true stars, and apparent stars. <b>a diviner of auspicious times, or a diviner of omens</b> already explained [<i>comment on</i> Leviticus 19:<small>26</small>] <b>a sorcerer</b> likewise [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 7:<small>11</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn368"><b>[11] combiner of combinations</b> those who claim that the demons combine with one another. I have already explained the terms <b>charmer</b> and <b>wizard</b> [<i>comment on</i> Leviticus 19:<small>26</small>]. <b>inquires of the dead</b> like those who go into a graveyard, and take a bone of a dead person. Through mental concentration, they then fall into a frenzy, upon which they see the simulacrum of various objects while dreaming (or even when awake). All of these practices
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn369"><b>[12]</b> are abominations to G<small>OD</small>. The true way is that
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn370"><b>[13]</b> the heart of a man should be ever devoted to his Creator. Whenever a man relies on his own crafts to learn the truth or predict the future, and not on G<small>OD</small>,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn371"><b>[14]</b> he is therefore spiritually imperfect as well as mistaken. Let him who wishes to inquire, inquire of G<small>OD</small>, through a prophet. For this reason,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn372"><b>[15]</b> we come forthwith to the section of <b>a prophet in your midst.</b> This is Joshua, as evidenced by the pronouncement to <b>him you shall listen</b>, and the subsequent confirmation “the children of Israel listened to him” [34:<small>9</small>]. Moreover, we find no other prophet, besides Joshua, who entered with Israel into the land. However, this verse also presents the paradigm for all future prophets who might arise after the time of Moshe. <b>such as I</b> i.e., a prophet of G<small>OD</small>, and not a soothsayer.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn373"><b>[19] I will punish him</b> meaning, his death will be in God’s hands. The evidence for this assertion is the passage describing the man who refused to obey the instructions of someone who was already known to be a prophet, and who commanded “strike me” [I Kings 20:<small>35</small>], speaking in the name of G<small>OD</small>.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn374"><b>[22] if the prophet predicts something…</b> Just as in the words of Jeremiah (“when the word of that prophet shall come to pass” [Jeremiah 28:<small>9</small>]), the event must occur <i>within the time specified</i> by the prophet.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn375"><b>[19:<small>3</small>]</b> After finishing explicating the matters of the diviners, which involved a form of idolatry prevalent in the area, Scripture now admonishes us not to shed innocent blood in the land. The sense of the juxtaposition is: Just as the land must be uncorrupted by the abomination of divination, so must the land be uncorrupted by innocent blood. <b>prepare the road</b> that the city be in a place served by usable and inhabited roadways. <b>apportion into three</b> Either

You will divide the land into three parts, at the points of these cities, or
You must place the cities each in its own third of the country.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn376"><b>[5] with his fellowman</b> As in many other instances, the Hebrew word <sup>⊃</sup><i>et</i> here has the sense of “with”. The word <b>strays</b> is a verb in the <i>nif‘al</i> form. The <i>qal</i> form of the verb can be seen in “He gathers together the outcasts of Israel” [Psalms 147:<small>2</small>]. <b>blade</b> [Hebrew: <i>garzen</i>] the iron part, with which one cuts the wood (from “<b>I</b> am cut off [Hebrew: <i>nigrazty</i>]” [Psalms 31:<small>23</small>]). <b>the blade drops</b> meaning, it moved (from, “your olives will drop off” [28:<small>40</small>]). Here the verb is intransitive; in the phrase “He will fell many nations” [7:<small>1</small>] the same word is transitive (compare the intransitive “a mighty voice, that has not continued” [5:<small>19</small>] with the transitive “G<small>OD</small> has added grief” [Jeremiah 45:<small>3</small>]). All this is according to the views of a great grammarian [probably Rabbi Y<sup>ǝ</sup>hudah ben David ibn Ḥayyuj — Translator]. But in my opinion, the verb is transitive in <i>both</i> instances [<i>cf.</i> Makkot 7b].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn377"><b>[6] strike him mortally</b> [literally: strike his life] an elliptical construction, meaning “strike him a mortal <i>blow</i>” — i.e., strike him a blow in a place from which his life will leave him.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn378"><b>[8] And if</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>your God enlarges…</b> This is conditional on the observance of the Torah. Accordingly, Scripture says,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn379"><b>[9] if you observe this entire commandment</b> (namely, the commandment of the three cities). <b>ever to walk in His ways</b> continuously.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn380"><b>[14]</b> The meaning of the word <b>remove</b> is known; it has a meaning close to “destroy”. Compare, “remove not the ancient landmark” [Proverbs 22:<small>28</small>]. <b>primogenitors</b> those who parceled out the land. This passage is juxtaposed to the previous one because land encroachment leads to arguments, to blows, and to murder. Accordingly, Scripture says later on, “a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth…” [:<small>21</small>]. Moreover, someone who accuses his fellow of encroaching on his property
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn381"><b>[15]</b> must bring witnesses, hence the passage <b>one witness will not stand</b> — whether testifying against a murderer, or a batterer, or an encroacher upon property, or anything else. <b>the testimony of two</b> [Hebrew: <i>shney</i>] <b>witnesses</b> Here Scripture employs the short form of the word. Elsewhere, Scripture reads “the testimony of two [Hebrew: <i>shnayim</i>] witnesses” [17:<small>6</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn382"><b>[16] to accuse him rebellious</b> e.g., idolatry [<i>see comment on</i> 13:<small>6</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn383"><b>[18]</b> The word <b>chastised</b> here means “accused”. It is also used in the contexts of injury and punishment.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn384"><b>[21] you must not show mercy</b> upon the false witness.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn385"><b>[20:<small>1</small>]</b> The passage <b>when you go out in war</b> is juxtaposed to the previous passage because, although “you must not show mercy” [19:<small>21</small>] upon the guilty, you <i>must</i> show mercy, when you go out in battle, upon the betrothed, the homebuilder, the planter, and the fainthearted.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn386"><b>[2] the kohen will come forward</b> i.e., the one specifically attached to the military [Soṭa 42a].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn387"><b>[3] fear not</b> in your thoughts. <b>neither be alarmed</b> so as to flee. <b>nor panic</b> in your actions [<i>see comment on</i> 1:<small>29</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn388"><b>[5] inaugurated it</b> as in “the dedication of the altar” [Numbers 7:<small>10</small>], and also “initiate the child” [Proverbs 22:<small>6</small>] (from which our Sages, of blessed memory, derived the principle that one must educate one’s children [Qiddushin 30a]). ¶ The reason for these commandments is that his attention, and all of his desires, are directed to dedicating his house. Thus, his thoughts are on his house, and not on the battle; consequently, he will flee, and he will induce others to flee.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn389"><b>[6] celebrated it</b> as in “flutes” [Jeremiah 48:<small>36</small>]. It was customary to party in the vineyards.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn390"><b>[7] betrothed a woman, but has not taken her</b> in marriage. ¶ This passage indicates that there is such a thing as dying before one’s time. Namely, someone who dies in war dies before his time. Accordingly, David said, “…or he shall descend into battle, and be swept away” [I Samuel 26:<small>10</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn391"><b>[8] cowardly</b> afraid to kill another. <b>faint hearted</b> afraid to be killed by another. The Hebrew preposition <sup>⊃</sup><i>et</i> before the word <b>the heart</b> seems to be extraneous; as I have explained, however [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 10:<small>8</small>], it indicates the most important noun in a clause.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn392"><b>[9] will be appointed</b> a verb in the <i>qal</i> form.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn393"><b>[10]</b> Presumably, the commandment to “offer it peace” only applies to an <i>optional</i> war [<i>see Sifrey</i> on this verse] [<i>see also</i> Palestinian Talmud Shvi‘it 6:<small>1</small>; the authorities disagree regarding this <i>halakha</i> — Translator].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn394"><b>[12] propitiate</b> that is, make peace.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn396"><b>[16] you must not spare</b> It was forbidden to feed them, or give them water. The basic principle is that one was required in those days to kill them, if possible.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn397"><b>[17]</b> Scripture does not here mention the Girgashites, because they were they fewest and the smallest of them.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn398"><b>[19] man is a tree of the field</b> I have already explained, in <i>Sefer Hayy<sup>ǝ</sup>sod</i>, that in every language there is a tendency to omit words in order to be concise. Nevertheless, one never omits the word “not”, because then one’s meaning is reversed. A great Spanish grammarian asserted that the sentence is missing an interrogative <i>heh</i>, as if Scripture were asking rhetorically, “is a tree of the field a man?” — but in my view this interpretation is not correct, because it makes no sense to explain a prohibition against destroying a <i>fruit</i> tree, on the grounds that a tree is not a man (and is thus incapable of running away). In my opinion there is no need for any of this. The meaning, rather, is as follows: <b>You may eat of them, but do not cut them down, for man is a tree of the field</b> (i.e., the <i>life</i> of man <i>depends</i> on the trees of the field). A similar construction appears in “for it is taking a life in pawn” [24:<small>6</small>], which clearly means “it is taking the <i>means</i> of a man’s <i>livelihood</i> in pawn”. The phrase <b>but do not cut them down</b> is conceptually tied to the phrase <b>to come before you in the siege,</b> to wit: You may not destroy fruit-bearing trees, which are a source of life to mankind, but you may eat of their fruit; you are forbidden to destroy them so that the besieged city will surrender before you. The subsequent phrase
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn399"><b>[20] cut to build up siegeworks</b> is proof that this is the correct interpretation. <b>until it is brought low</b> for if it were not a great city, Scripture would not have said “a long time” [:<small>19</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn400"><b>[21:<small>1</small>] If a corpse is found</b> After mentioning the case of war against our enemies, Scripture now discusses the case when a man wages war against his fellow man, and a corpse is found in the land of Israel, the murderer of which is unknown.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn401"><b>[2] your elders</b> i.e., the elders and judges of the nearby cities.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn402"><b>[3] which was not yet used</b> for plowing. <b>which was not yet drawn to the yoke</b> to draw loads, that being the normal use of heifers.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn403"><b>[4] uncultivated</b> rough. <b>there they shall break the neck</b> [literally: they shall neck] i.e., they will remove the heifer’s neck.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn404"><b>[5] the kohanim, the descendants of Levi</b> those that are clearly descended from Levi [<i>cf. comment on</i> 17:<small>9</small>]. <b>on their lips shall be</b> the punishment determined for <b>every conflict and every blow.</b>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn405"><b>[6] then all the elders of the town</b> this clarifies “your elders will come forth” [:<small>2</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn406"><b>[7]</b> The <i>heh</i> in the word <b>spilled</b> takes the place of the ordinary plural indicator, as in “my steps had slipped” [Psalms 73:<small>2</small>]. There is also a homiletic explanation to the effect that the verb became singular (since the word “hand” is feminine, in most cases [<i>see comment on</i> Exodus 17:<small>12</small>]). <b>and our eyes did not see</b> The reason G<small>OD</small> commanded the nearest city to perform this ritual is <i>probably</i> that, had they not done a corresponding sin, it would not have happened that a man close to them was murdered. But the thoughts of G<small>OD</small>, next to our own, are limitlessly deep and profound. <b>they will call out and say</b> Compare, “you shall call out and say” [26:<small>5</small>], where I shall explain it [<i>comment on</i> 26:<small>5</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn407"><b>[8] forgive your people</b> For we were negligent, and we did not guard the dangerous highways. The word <b>will secure forgiveness</b> omits the <i>tav</i> of the <i>nitpa‘el</i> form (as in “that all women may be taught” [Ezekiel 23:<small>48</small>]), which is a combination of two forms: the <i>hitpa‘el</i> form and the <i>nif‘al</i> form. Scripture mentions <b>whom You have redeemed,</b> as if to say: Just as You redeemed them from Egypt, for the sake of Your kindness, so may You redeem them from this blood, and its punishment.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn408"><b>[9] So will you remove the innocent blood</b> either

the punishment for innocent bloodshed

or

the word “blood” is here to be understood to denote “the blood <i>of the</i> innocent”

or

(according to some people) you must destroy those who shed blood

In my opinion, it is as I have explained [<i>comment on</i> :<small>7</small>] — innocent blood will not be spilled in your land if you <b>do that which is right in the eyes of</b> G<small>OD</small> (as expressed in the mystery of “the reward of transgression is transgression” [Avot 4:<small>2</small>] and “the reward of virtue is virtue” [Avot 4:<small>2</small>]).

After that you may approach her, be her husband, and she be to you for a wife. <sup><xref rid="fn414">[14]</xref></sup>It shall be, should you not desire her, you must send her off to be her own person. You may not sell her for money, nor may you enslave her, for you have humbled her.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn415">[15]</xref></sup>If a man has two wives, one beloved and one despised, and both the beloved and the despised have borne him children, but the despised’s son is the firstborn, <sup><xref rid="fn416">[16]</xref></sup>when he bequeathes his estate to his children, he cannot make the son of the beloved wife the firstborn, in preference to the firstborn son of the despised. <sup><xref rid="fn417">[17]</xref></sup>But he must recognize the despised’s firstborn, by allotting him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the first fruit of his strength, and the right of the firstborn is his.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn418">[18]</xref></sup>If a man has an insubordinate and rebellious son, who does not follow the instructions of his father and the instructions of his mother, and they discipline him, but he does not listen to them, <sup><xref rid="fn419">[19]</xref></sup>His father and mother will take hold of him and bring him to the city elders, at the gateway of that place. <sup><xref rid="fn420">[20]</xref></sup>They will declare before the city elders: ‘This son of ours is insubordinate and rebellious; he does not follow our instructions, a glutton and a drunkard.’ <sup>[21]</sup>All the people of his city will stone him to death with stones. So will you remove the evil from your midst, and all Israel will hear, and fear.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn421">[22]</xref></sup>If a man is under a death sentence for a sin, and is executed, and you hang him on the gallows, <sup><xref rid="fn422">[23]</xref></sup>His corpse must not remain overnight on the gallows; you must bury him on the same day, for a hanged man is a curse of God. You shall not defile your land which G<small>OD</small> your God is giving you for an inheritance.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn423">[22:1]</xref></sup>You must not look on when your fellowman’s ox or his lamb runs away and conceal yourself of them; you must bring them back to your fellowman. <sup><xref rid="fn424">[2]</xref></sup>If your fellowman is not near you, or you do not know him, you must bring it home, and it will remain with you until your fellowman asks for it; then, return it to him. <sup><xref rid="fn425">[3]</xref></sup>You will do the same with his donkey; you will do the same with his garment; and so must you do with every lost article of your fellowman, which he has lost and you have found. You cannot conceal yourself.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn426">[4]</xref></sup>You must not look on when your fellowman’s donkey or his ox are fallen down on the road, and conceal yourself of them; you certainly must raise up with him.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn427">[5]</xref></sup>The attire of a man must not be worn by a woman, neither may a man dress himself in the garments of a woman; for whoever does these things is abhorrent to G<small>OD</small> your God.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn428">[6]</xref></sup>If you happen upon a bird’s nest on the road, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs and the mother sitting upon the young or on the eggs, do not take the mother with young. <sup><xref rid="fn429">[7]</xref></sup>You must send the mother away, and then take the young for yourself, so that it may be good with you, and you shall extend your days.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn430">[8]</xref></sup>When you build a new house, you will make a railing for the roof, so that you do not bring bloodshed on your house if a falling person may fall down from it. <sup><xref rid="fn431">[9]</xref></sup>You must not sow your vineyard with diverse seeds, lest the admixture of the seed, which you sow together with the products of the vineyard, will be consecrated.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn432">[10]</xref></sup>You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together. <sup><xref rid="fn433">[11]</xref></sup>You must not wear wool-and-linen (wool and linen together).</p>

<p><sup><xref rid="fn435">[13]</xref></sup>If a man takes a woman, marries her, and dislikes her, <sup><xref rid="fn436">[14]</xref></sup>and he brings charges against her, in words, defaming her reputation by alleging: ‘I took this woman, and after approaching her, I found her not to have virginity.’ <sup><xref rid="fn437">[15]</xref></sup>The father and the mother of the young woman will bring forth the young woman’s virginity before the elders of the city at the city gates. <sup>[16]</sup>And the father of the young woman will declare to the elders: ‘I gave my daughter to this man, but he disliked her, <sup>[17]</sup>charging her with accusatory words, alleging: “I found your daughter not to have her virginity.” But here is the virginity of my daughter.’ When they spread the sheet before the elders of the city, <sup>[18]</sup>The elders of that city will take the man and punish him, <sup><xref rid="fn438">[19]</xref></sup>and fine him a hundred pieces of silver, and give it to the father of the young woman, for he defamed the reputation of an Israelite virgin. She will remain his wife; he may not divorce her all his days.</p>
<p><sup>[20]</sup>But if this matter was true — the young woman was found not to have virginity — <sup><xref rid="fn439">[21]</xref></sup>then they will bring the young woman out to the entrance of her father’s house, and the inhabitants of the city will stone her to death with stones, for she performed an obscenity in Israel, to prostitute her father’s house. You must remove the evil from your midst.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn440">[22]</xref></sup>If a man is found lying with a married woman, both of them shall also die — the man who lay with the woman, and the woman. You must remove the evil from Israel.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn441">[23]</xref></sup>If there shall be a young virgin woman betrothed to a man, and someone meets her in the town, and lies with her, <sup><xref rid="fn442">[24]</xref></sup>You shall bring both of them to the gate of that town, and stone them to death with stones — the young woman, because it was in the city and she did not call for help, and the man because he violated his fellowman’s bride. You must remove the evil from your midst.</p>
<p><sup>[25]</sup>But if the man finds the betrothed young woman in the field, and the man lay with her by force, only the man who lay with her must be put to death. <sup><xref rid="fn443">[26]</xref></sup>The young woman you will not punish. There is no death sentence against the young woman, for this matter is as a man lurking against his fellowman and murdering him, <sup><xref rid="fn444">[27]</xref></sup>for he found her in the field. The young betrothed woman cried out for help, but there was no one to help her.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn445">[28]</xref></sup>If a man meets a young woman, a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and assaults her, when they are found — <sup>[29]</sup>The man who assaulted her shall pay fifty pieces of silver to the father of the young woman, and he must marry her. Because he violated her, he may not divorce her all his days.</p>

<p><sup>[4]</sup>An Ammonite or a Moabite may not enter into G<small>OD</small>’s community; even their tenth generation may not enter into G<small>OD</small>’s community, forever. <sup>[5]</sup>Because they did not receive you with bread and water on the way when you came out of Egypt, and because he hired against you Balaam, the son of Beor, from Pethor of Syria, to curse you. <sup><xref rid="fn449">[6]</xref></sup>But G<small>OD</small> your God did not consent to listen to Balaam; G<small>OD</small> your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because G<small>OD</small> your God loves you. <sup>[7]</sup>You must not seek their friendship not their welfare all your days — forever.</p>
<p><sup>[8]</sup>You must not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother. You must not abhor an Egyptian, for you have been an alien in his land. <sup>[9]</sup>The children of their third generation who are born to them may enter into G<small>OD</small>’s community.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn450">[10]</xref></sup>When the camp goes forth against your enemy, you must guard against every evil thing. <sup><xref rid="fn451">[11]</xref></sup>If anyone among you will be not ritually pure through a nocturnal event, he must leave the camp; he must not re-enter the camp. <sup><xref rid="fn452">[12]</xref></sup>At eventide he must bathe in water, and when the sun sets, he may come within the camp. <sup><xref rid="fn453">[13]</xref></sup>There must be a quarter outside of the army camp where you go out to excrete. <sup><xref rid="fn454">[14]</xref></sup>Also, among your weapons, you must have a spade; so that when you have relieved yourself outside the camp, you will dig a hole with it and cover over your excrement. <sup><xref rid="fn455">[15]</xref></sup>G<small>OD</small> your God walks in the midst of your camp to save you and deliver your enemies before you, therefore must your camp be holy; nothing unchaste must be seen among you, lest He depart from you.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn456">[16]</xref></sup>You must not turn over a slave to his master; when he seeks refuge with you from his master, <sup><xref rid="fn457">[17]</xref></sup>he will live in your midst, in any place which he chooses within your gates, wherever he likes best; you must not oppress him.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn458">[18]</xref></sup>There shall be no prostitute from among the daughters of Israel, nor shall there be a male prostitute from among the sons of Israel. <sup><xref rid="fn459">[19]</xref></sup>You shall not bring the earnings of a harlot, nor the price of a dog, into the house of G<small>OD</small> your God for any vow, for both are an abomination to G<small>OD</small> your God.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn460">[20]</xref></sup>You may not utilize interest with your brother, whether interest of money, interest of food, or interest of anything which may be considered interest. <sup>[21]</sup>With an alien you may utilize interest; with your brother you must not utilize interest, so that G<small>OD</small> your God will bless you in all your undertakings in the land which you enter to possess.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn461">[22]</xref></sup>When you vow a donation to G<small>OD</small> your God, you must not defer fulfilling it, for G<small>OD</small> your God will require it of you, and you will be found guilty. <sup>[23]</sup>By refraining from making a vow, you will not commit a sin. <sup><xref rid="fn462">[24]</xref></sup>You must fulfill whatever issues from your lips, and perform the pledge which you spoke with your mouth, as you vowed to G<small>OD</small> your God.</p>

<ftnote id="fn410"><b>[10]</b> The passage <b>when you go out</b> is connected to the passage “When you besiege a city” [20:<small>19</small>]. The passage of the broken-necked heifer was inserted between the two passages because it applies to a corpse that is found within the land of Israel — but not outside the land of Israel, and not in wartime [<i>cf.</i> Soṭa 47b].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn411"><b>[11]</b> Our Sages, of blessed memory, have already explained [Qiddushin 21b] the form of the word <b>woman</b> [<i>construct case</i>]. <b>good-looking</b> in his eyes. <b>you desire her, and take her for your wife</b> i.e., you desire <i>to</i> take her for your wife — for only later does Scripture say, “you may be her husband” [:<small>13</small>] (similar is “I took her to me, to be my wife” [Genesis 12:<small>19</small>]).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn412"><b>[12]</b> Some say the reason why <b>you will bring her into your house, where she will shave</b> is that perhaps you desire her on account of her hair — accordingly, you must shave it. <b>do her nails</b> i.e., grow her nails, so that she may be repulsive in his eyes.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn413"><b>[13] she will remove her raiment of captivity</b> perhaps he desired her on account of her beautiful clothing. <b>weep</b> in order to drive away the joy he has in her. <b>a full month</b> during which his desire may abate. ¶ Alternately, some say that “she will shave” [:<small>12</small>] because she was formerly ritually impure (as in the treatment of someone afflicted with <i>ṣara‘at</i> [Leviticus 14:<small>8</small>]). “Do” [:<small>12</small>] means <i>rectify</i>, the improvement being that she cut off the excess part (as in “he had not done his beard” [II Samuel 19:<small>25</small>] and “instead of well-done hair” [Isaiah 3:<small>24</small>]). The concept of <i>improvement</i> underlies all Scriptural instances of “doing”, except those that refer to disgusting, or completely evil, things. <b>She will remove her raiment</b> because it is befouled. ¶ The sense of <b>she will stay in your house, and weep</b> is that she <i>must</i> stay in your house a full month while she bewails <b>her father and her mother,</b> if they were recently deceased. Some say that she weeps for her father and mother because they did not convert to Judaism; but in my opinion, every mentally balanced human being is obliged to honor his father and mother, in life and in death. <b>weep</b> i.e., she must mourn for them (in the Jewish manner, because she has converted to Judaism) if they were killed at the time she was taken captive. It is unnecessary to mention here that she must immerse herself, since she requires the standard “waters of separation” [Palestinian Talmud Pesaḥim 8:<small>8</small> (36b)], as was previously stated: “both yourselves, and your captives” [Numbers 31:<small>19</small>]. Our Sages, of blessed memory, ruled that one must abstain for three months [Yevamot 48b]. Although there is no need to bring support for their words, the evidence for their reasoning is seen in the verse “about three months later” [Genesis 38:<small>24</small>] — that being the time when the fetus first begins to stir. It is forbidden to initiate sexual relations with a woman unless one knows whether or not she is pregnant, in order that the paternity of the child may be known — for some babies are born two months earlier than normal, or later than normal (though the latter is less common). <b>a full month</b> [literally: a lunation of days] as in “a month of days” [Numbers 11:<small>21</small>]. I have already explained how the term “lunation” denotes a month, since the basis of a month is the lunar cycle.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn414"><b>[14] you must send her off to be her own person</b> free to do what she likes. <b>you must not sell her for money</b> Scripture describes the common practice, but the intent is that she may not be sold in exchange for <i>anything.</i> <b>nor may you enslave her</b> Compare, “…enslaves him, and sells him” [24:<small>7</small>]. The word has no other cognates. Its meaning must be deduced from context, from which we understand it to denote some form of dishonesty.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn415"><b>[15] beloved</b> in his view — not in an absolute sense. <b>despised</b> an adjective. This passage is connected to the previous passage on account of the two cited outcomes: “you desire her” [:<small>11</small>] and “you do not desire her” [:<small>14</small>].

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn417"><b>[17] recognize</b>

He must grant him a formal recognition.

or

He must publicly designate him to be the firstborn, if he is in a place where he is not known.

or

He is obliged from the beginning to recognize which of his sons is the elder, in the case when there were twin boys.

<b>a double portion</b> He is to take two portions. If there are three sons, then the estate is to be divided into fourths, and he will take two portions. If there are two sons, the estate will be divided into thirds, <i>et cetera</i> (in my opinion, this is also the correct interpretation of “let a double portion of your spirit be upon me” [II Kings 2:<small>9</small>], as I have explained in its proper place [no copy of this commentary is known — Translator]). <b>he is the first fruit of his strength</b> that is, as far as is known.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn418"><b>[18] insubordinate and rebellious</b> against G<small>OD</small>, and against his parents (if the latter be God-fearing people). <b>insubordinate</b> as in “like a headstrong cow” [Hosea 4:<small>16</small>], meaning he does not observe the positive commandments. <b>rebellious</b> regarding the negative commandments. <b>they discipline him</b> in front of witnesses.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn419"><b>[19]</b> They are obliged to take hold him and bring him. The traditional explanation of this verse [that the law can apply only to someone who has both parents — <i>Sifrey</i> on this verse] is also true.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn420"><b>[20] glutton</b> is a general term, denoting someone who permits himself everything that he desires. But here the word is explained [Sanhedrin 70a] specifically to denote a gluttonous eater of meat. <b>drunkard</b> someone who drinks excessively, to the extent that he gets drunk. Such a person resembles a follower of Epicuros, for he seeks from the life of this world only pleasure, through all kinds of food and drink. This passage appears here on account of the passage of the good-looking woman; this is evidenced by various Scriptural instances of “…the name of his mother” [Leviticus 24:<small>11</small>] [I Kings 15:<small>2</small>]. See also my hint concerning the sons of Aaron [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 6:<small>23</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn421"><b>[22]</b> From our Sages, of blessed memory, we have received the laws explaining which criminals are hanged [Sanhedrin 45b].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn422"><b>[23] a hanged man is a curse of God</b> since he blasphemed against G<small>OD</small>. But the simple explanation is that God is the source of the curse, which will descend everywhere close to the hanged man. There is a mysterious aspect to this curse which attaches itself to human life. Accordingly, Scripture says <b>you shall not defile your land.</b> This passage is necessarily placed in close proximity to the passages describing warfare (as it is written: “When you go out in war…” [:<small>10</small>]). As demonstrated in the Gibeonite War [Joshua 10:<small>27</small>], the reason behind <b>must not remain overnight</b> is not the dignity of the corpse, but rather, the dignity of the land. In this respect it does not matter whether the dead body be Canaanite or Israelite.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn423"><b>[22:<small>1</small>] You must not look on when the ox…</b> even if you are on your way to war, as it is homiletically explained. The word <b>and conceal yourself</b> is the displaced continuation of the phrase, <b>you must not look on.</b> Scripture mentions the <b>ox</b> and the <b>lamb</b>, and has previously mentioned the donkey [Exodus 23:<small>4</small>], but the law is the same for all livestock.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn424"><b>[2] you must bring it home</b> if you are returning home. Otherwise, you must appoint a reliable agent to do so.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn425"><b>[3]</b> The phrase <b>you cannot</b> is here to be interpreted as it is in similar instances [<i>cf. comment on</i> 21:<small>16</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn426"><b>[4] fallen down</b> is parallel in meaning to “lying” [Exodus 23:<small>5</small>]; the former is simply a more general term. <b>you must certainly raise up with him</b> but not alone. Compare, “you must certainly relieve with him” [Exodus 23:<small>5</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn427"><b>[5]</b> The passage dealing with <b>the attire of a man</b> is juxtaposed to the passages dealing with going out to war, because Woman was created to rear children, and if she were instead to go out among the men to war, she would eventually become involved in debauchery. For the same reason <b>a man may not dress himself…,</b> because otherwise a man who does not yet have a full beard could mix with women, and he could fornicate with them, without the matter becoming widely known. This passage shows us that the Israelite custom, like that of most cultures, was that men’s clothing was distinctive from women’s clothing — they were not the same. Some commentators understand this passage to be an allusion to unnatural sexual intercourse. Although there is no need for such an interpretation here, G<small>OD</small> surely detests anyone who alters G<small>OD</small>’s design.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn428"><b>[6]</b> The passage of <b>if you happen upon</b> is tied to an earlier passage through the common phrase “on the road” [:<small>4</small>]. <b>happen upon</b> [Hebrew: <i>yiqqare</i><sup>⊃</sup>] from the word “happenstance” [Hebrew: <i>miqreh</i>] [I Samuel 6:<small>9</small>] [albeit here the word is spelled with an <i>’alef</i> — Translator] (as in “as I happened by chance” [II Samuel 1:<small>6</small>]). Here it means “to encounter”. The <i>’alef</i> in the word <b>young ones</b> is extraneous, like the <i>’alef</i> in “and with your [actually, “an” — Translator] arm” [Jeremiah 32:<small>21</small>]. The point of this commandment is that it would be profoundly cruel if “the mother is dashed in pieces upon her children” [Hosea 10:<small>14</small>], just as in the case of an ox, or a lamb [Leviticus 22:<small>28</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn429"><b>[7] it may be good with you</b> G<small>OD</small> will show mercy to you, and bestow good upon you. <b>you shall extend your days</b> since you did not destroy the entire nest, but left alive the progenitor.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn430"><b>[8]</b> The passage of <b>when you buy a new house</b> is juxtaposed to the previous passages, because the commandments concerning residences will apply only after engaging in warfare upon entering the land. The word <b>railing</b> [Hebrew: <i>ma</i><sup>⊂<i>ɒ</i></sup><i>qeh</i>] has no cognates; its meaning is understood from context. One grammarian [it is not certain who is meant, but it could be Yosef Qimḥi — Translator] derived it from “the offenses [Hebrew: <sup>⊂</sup><i>aqat</i>] of the wicked” [Psalms 55:<small>4</small>], and thereby succeeded only in being rather offensive himself. <b>falling person</b> Scripture employs prolepsis, describing what he becomes. Compare, “the condemned [literally: the dead person] will die” [17:<small>6</small>], “you strip the naked of their clothing” [Job 22:<small>6</small>], and also “the sons moved strongly” [Genesis 25:<small>22</small>]. Countless other words, as well, describe what their referents will <i>become.</i> We do not know whether this is the ordinary Hebrew idiom, or whether they are all prophetic utterances (like “he pursued as far as Dan” [Genesis 14:<small>14</small>], “to Grapecluster Valley” [Numbers 13:<small>23</small>], and “therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother, and join with his wife” [Genesis 2:<small>24</small>]).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn431"><b>[9]</b> The commandments of sowing and planting follow the commandments involving a house, because after entering the land, and building a house, one proceeds to sow. The consequence <b>lest it be consecrated</b> is conditional on <b>you must not sow … with diverse seeds.</b> The Spaniard Menaḥem ben Ya‘aqov ibn Saruq has explained in his Textbook that the word <b>consecrated</b> comes from the triliteral root q-d-sh, on account of the seeds’ intermixture with one another.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn432"><b>[10] You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey</b> G<small>OD</small> shows mercy to all of His creatures (for a donkey is not so powerful as an ox). This passage is connected to the previous one through the common concept of <i>sowing.</i> For the same reason,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn433"><b>[11]</b> Scripture proceeds to discuss <b>wool-and-linen.</b> This prohibition was mentioned before [Leviticus 19:<small>19</small>] in general terms, but now Scripture explains it to denote <b>wool and linen,</b> and no other fabrics.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn434"><b>[12] you must make for yourself tassels</b> The Dissenters claim that this is a separate commandment, applicable at night, as the “fringes” [Numbers 15:<small>38</small>] are applicable during the day, and for this reason Scripture says <b>which you cover yourself.</b> The Exegetes, though, have transmitted to us the knowledge that this verse discusses the <i>same</i> commandment as the “fringes”, and that it is applicable only during the day. The word <b>tassels</b> is to be interpreted in the sense wherein it was used apropos the building of the Temple: “wreathes of chain-work” [I Kings 7:<small>17</small>]. The Dissenters derived it from “largeness”; but we shall believe only in the words of our forebears. Scripture mentions this verse in order to specify that the commandment applies only to things with <b>four corners.</b> It is connected to the topic of wool-and-linen, because wool-and-linen is permissible on one’s fringes [Yevamot 4b].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn435"><b>[13]</b> According to the Dissenters, the passage dealing with <b>when a man takes a woman</b> appears here because of the connecting idea “with which you cover yourself” [:<small>12</small>]. However, the truth is in accordance with the homiletic explanation: the passages concerned with the house are followed by passages concerned with one’s garment, followed by passages that involve the mistress of the house.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn436"><b>[14] charges</b> i.e., “grounds”. <b>words</b> which could be either true or false. <b>virginity</b> a plural noun without a singular form [<i>cf. comment on</i> Leviticus 21:<small>13</small>], like “youth” [<i>cf.</i> Ecclesiastes 11:<small>9</small>], “old age” [Genesis 37:<small>3</small>], and “childhood” [<i>cf.</i> Isaiah 54:<small>4</small>].

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn439"><b>[21] they will stone her</b> It is assumed that someone had sexual relations with her <i>after</i> she was betrothed (the fiancé presumably having betrothed her only upon her stating that she was a virgin). The Exegetes of our religion have interpreted these matters in exceedingly great detail [Ketubbot 44b<i>ff</i>]. The abovementioned “virginity” can be obtained only up to a certain time [Ketubbot 36a], depending on the biology of the young woman. Because of the word <b>they shall stone her,</b> this passage is connected to
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn440"><b>[22]</b> the case of the married woman, and subsequently the case of the betrothed woman. <b>also</b> the particulars of one case are the particulars of the other, with the exception of such additional details as are introduced in each case.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn445"><b>[28]</b> <i>This</i> instance of a woman <b>who is not betrothed</b> is that of the assaulted woman, <i>not</i> the seduced [Exodus 22:<small>15</small>] woman.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn447"><b>[2] gonads</b> [Hebrew: <i>dakkah</i>] testicles (the word has no cognate). Some grammarians have offered an etymology from the tissue of a testicle, that it is “crushed” [Hebrew: <i>dakkah</i>] — but this is far-fetched. <b>phallus</b> [Hebrew: <i>shofkhah</i>] denotes the penis, from which one spills out [Hebrew: <i>yishpokh</i>] one’s urine, and semen. <b>…G<small>OD</small>’s community</b> meaning, he shall not be considered as one of G<small>OD</small>’s community for purposes of marriage to an Israelite woman [Qiddushin 72b–73a]. The same applies to an Ammonite (but not an Ammonitess), and a Moabite (but not a Moabitess<sup><xref rid="fn493">1</xref></sup>).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn448"><b>[3]</b> the term <b><i>mamzer</i></b> has been explained by our Sages, of blessed memory, to denote offspring that come from incest [Yevamot 49a]. The two <i>mem</i>’s are extraneous, like the <i>mem</i>’s in “the barns are broken down” [Joel 1:<small>17</small>]. Others claim that it is the name of a nation, since we see the verse “a <i>mamzer</i> shall dwell in Ashdod” [Zechariah 9:<small>6</small>] — and it is unlikely that Israel would be mentioned in uncomplimentary terms, even in a passage dealing with Messianic times (the Aramaic translator there gives a nonliteral translation).

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn450"><b>[10] When the camp goes forth</b> The camp that goes out in battle against the enemy, bringing the Ark with it, is known as the “lesser camp” (as opposed to the “greater camp”, where the Ark was surrounded by partitions). When they went out in battle, they were close to the environs of the Ark. Clearly, to be “ritually impure due to a nocturnal event” means to have had a seminal emission. The juxtaposition of this passage to the previous one, which mentioned the Balaam affair, is due to the Midianite War (since they had “harassed” us on account of “their princess” [<i>see</i> Numbers 25:<small>18</small>]), because the Ark was with them in the campaign against Midian. <b>every evil thing</b> To the spirit, and to the body, like a seminal emission.

This provides support for the words of our Sages, of blessed memory [<i>cf.</i> Berakhot 2b; Nazir 66a], whereas the Dissenters assert that <b>tide</b> means “before” — but this is a vacuous statement. Some say that the term denotes when the day first begins to decline; but we see that after <b>at eventide,</b> Scripture goes on to say <b>when the sun sets,</b> thus indicating the time right before sunset. Compare, “at daybreak” [Exodus 14:<small>27</small>], which means “right before sunrise”.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn453"><b>[13] quarter</b> here means a place, as in “the flank of the Jordan” [Numbers 13:<small>29</small>]. This verse provides additional evidence that the topic is the “lesser camp” [<i>cf. comment on</i> :<small>10</small>], since a man with a seminal emission was not required to leave the camp of Israel, and certainly not all people (including infants!) when they need to relieve themselves. Further evidence is given by the verse “they must expel from the camp everyone suffering from <i>ṣara‘at</i>, everyone suffering from a constant flow, and everyone who is ritually impure from a corpse” [Numbers 5:<small>2</small>] — i.e., any ritually impure person <i>capable of rendering someone else ritually impure</i> [the <i>halakha</i> [Pesaḥim 67a–67b] is that the cited verse applies to such people as well — Translator] — but not someone ritually impure for only one day.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn457"><b>[17] you must not oppress him.</b> The passage
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn458"><b>[18]</b> involving a prostitute comes next, because of the connection through the male slave. The Exegetes of our religion have asserted [Sanhedrin 54b] that a <b>male prostitute</b> denotes a catamite (as evidenced by the preposition <b><i>from</i> the sons of Israel</b>). Moreover, when Elihu said “…and their life as that of the male prostitutes” [Job 36:<small>14</small>], the word “their soul” was parallel to “their life”, and thus the word “male prostitutes” was parallel to “youth”. In addition, there are the verses “there was male prostitution in the land” [I Kings 14:<small>24</small>], and “the houses of the male prostitutes” [II Kings 23:<small>7</small>] (where the latter are distinct from the “women”, who were “weaving there”). I do not understand the etymology of the word <b>prostitute</b>. However, when one inquires thoroughly into the meaning of the word, it becomes clear that it denotes a woman who is receptive to any man (this is evidenced by “where is the prostitute?” [Genesis 38:<small>21</small>]). If so, then a <b>male prostitute</b> is someone who performs the acts of the Egyptians — <i>verbum sat sapienti.</i> After mentioning harlotry, Scripture then proceeds to discuss
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn459"><b>[19] the earnings of a harlot.</b> The word <b>earnings</b> [Hebrew: <sup>⊃</sup><i>etnan</i>] comes from the word “gift” [Hebrew: <i>mattan</i>], with an extraneous <i>’alef</i>, and a repeated <i>nun</i> (like the <i>peh</i> in “her adulteries” [Hosea 2:<small>4</small>] and the <i>resh</i> in “torrential” [Proverbs 27:<small>15</small>]). It denotes that which the prostitute took (i.e., that which was <i>given</i> her by the men who engaged in prostitution with her). Scripture says <b>an abomination</b> in this case, because the act is forbidden, and in the case of <b>the price of a dog,</b> because it is disrespectful.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn460"><b>[20] you must not utilize interest with your brother</b> Having mentioned the non-Jewish slave, Scripture must now elucidate that you are permitted to charge him interest, even though it says, concerning him, “you must not oppress him” [:<small>17</small>]. <b>you must not utilize interest with your brother</b>

There is a difference between “charge interest” and “utilize interest”: The latter means that you may not even <i>accept</i> interest from your brother who offers it to you (who would also be guilty of violating the interest prohibition). The verb takes both a direct and an indirect object.
Others say that “utilize interest” is the same as “charge interest”, and there is no difference between the two words.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn461"><b>[22]</b> Having mentioned the prohibition of “the earnings of a harlot … for any vow” [:<small>19</small>], Scripture now discusses the case of <b>when you vow a donation. will require it</b> Scripture makes an analogy to a human being, who is sure to seek after that which you have promised. <b>you will be found guilty</b> i.e., you will be punished.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn462"><b>[24] whatever issues from your lips</b> in any matter involving mention of the Name. <b>pledge</b> for every vow is a pledge, although clearly not every pledge is a vow [<i>cf. comment on</i> Leviticus 22:<small>18</small>]. <b>which you spoke with your mouth</b> Once the words have been uttered you may not take them back.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn463"><b>[25] When you come into your fellowman’s vineyard</b> in order to harvest the grapes, you may eat them. This passage is connected to the previous one, because you are required to fulfill your vows from your own possessions, and not take others’ property for your own use. The <i>yod</i> in the word <b>your bag</b> is vocalized with a schwa, like the <i>yod</i> in “your jewelry” [Exodus 33:<small>5</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn464"><b>[26] into your fellowman’s grain field</b> in order to harvest the grain (the passage <b>you must not lift up a sickle</b> caused the Dissenters to claim that permission is extended to wayfarers as well). <b>you may pluck</b> as in “they pluck saltworts” [Job 30:<small>4</small>]. The meaning of <b>ears of grain</b> is determined from context. <b>sickle</b> is a quadriliteral word.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn465"><b>[24:<small>1</small>] a woman</b> is also considered somewhat like a “field” [<i>cf. comment on</i> Leviticus 19:<small>23</small>]. <b>disliking her</b> e.g., they have incompatible personalities. <b>having found her</b> but he is unable to demonstrate it because there were no witnesses. The connective <i>vav</i> here has the sense of “or”, as in “he who strikes his father or his mother” [Exodus 21:<small>15</small>].

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn468"><b>[4] she became impure</b> with respect to the first husband only. The sense is that she is impure <i>to him</i>, because she had sexual relations with another man. The <i>ṭet</i> acquires a <i>dagesh</i> because it absorbs the <i>tav</i> of the <i>hotpa‘el.</i> Compare, “the symptom after being laundered” [Leviticus 13:<small>55</small>]. The command <b>you must not defile</b> is addressed to the nation of Israel.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn469"><b>[5]</b> Some say that <b>a new woman</b> denotes a virgin; but the majority opinion is that it means someone new <i>to him</i> (since a man may remarry his divorced wife — if she did not become “impure” [<i>cf.</i> :<small>4</small>] — Scripture has to specify a <b>new</b> woman). <b>untainted</b> i.e., he shall be free from the government’s levies. The word <b>untainted</b> is used as it is in “him that is innocent” [Job 22:<small>30</small>]. The <i>lamed</i> in <b>anything</b> is extraneous (as in “the third, Avshalom” [I Chronicles 3:<small>2</small>]).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn470"><b>[6]</b> The Dissenters claim that the passage <b>one may not take for security the lower millstone, nor the upper millstone</b> is juxtaposed to the previous verse on account of “gladden his wife” [:<small>5</small>], and that it is an allusion to sexual intercourse (in other words, he may not withhold sex) — but this is vacuous inanity. They offer for proof the verse “let my wife grind unto another” [Job 31:<small>10</small>], which I have already explained. The true meaning is the literal one: It is forbidden for someone to take a millstone as security. The sentence fails to specify its subject, as in “he told Joseph” [Genesis 48:<small>1</small>], “she bore her to Levi” [Exodus 26:<small>59</small>], and many similar instances. In all cases the implicit subject is assumed: “<i>the speaker</i> spoke to Joseph”, “<i>the mother</i> bore her to Levi”, etc. The word <b>lower millstone</b> is in the dual form, and presumably does not exist in the singular form. The <b>upper millstone</b> is the one that stays in the water, although others say that it denotes the wood that surrounds the millstone, and others say that the <b>lower millstone</b> is the one on the bottom, and the <b>upper millstone</b> is the one on the top. <b>for it is taking a life in pawn</b> because it produces life’s sustenance. ¶ We need not address those who rely excessively on the juxtaposition of passages, since every commandment stands on its own, and explaining their connection is for homiletical purposes only [<i>cf. comment on</i> 16:<small>18</small>]. However, one notices the following connections in this region of the text: Scripture mentions that one may not steal another’s grapes, to take into one’s bag [23:<small>25</small>], nor lift up a sickle against another’s grain [23:<small>26</small>]. It then discusses one’s taking of a wife — at which point she becomes <i>his</i> [:<small>1</small>] — and mentions that even if she is divorced from him [:<small>1</small>], another man who marries her must still rejoice with her, and must not be <i>pressed</i> into military service [:<small>5</small>]. The taking of a <b>millstone</b> in pledge is a form of <i>oppression</i>, as is
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn471"><b>[7] kidnapping.</b> Moreover, the symptom of <i>ṣara‘at</i> [:<small>8</small>] comes about through inattention to one’s speech, which is extremely <i>harmful</i> to those who are closest to one. Accordingly one must not <i>mistreat</i> a poor person regarding his pledge [:<small>10</small>], nor may one mistreat a hireling [:<small>14</small>], in order that one’s small children shall not die from their fathers’ sins [:<small>16</small>]. This also relates to discriminating against an alien, or an orphan, or to the taking of a widow’s garment as a security [:<small>17</small>], as well as to forgotten grain [:<small>19</small>], since it belongs to the destitute, as do the fruit which “you may not glean” [:<small>21</small>]. This leads to the concept of “lest he continue”, and thus “be degraded” [25:<small>3</small>]. To muzzle an ox [25:<small>4</small>] is a mistreatment of the animal, which cannot eat as it toils; a man who refuses his levirate duties [25:<small>7</small>] perpetrates a form of mistreatment, as does the woman who grabs genitalia [25:<small>11</small>]. Keeping two different measures of weight [25:<small>13</small>], or two different measures of volume [25:<small>14</small>], is certainly a form a mistreatment. And finally, Amalek mistreated Israel [25:<small>17</small>]. <b>¶ of his brethren</b> Scripture proceeds to specify <b>of the children of Israel,</b> since Edom is also called “brother” [<i>cf.</i> 23:<small>8</small>]. This instance of the verb <b>enslaves</b> means the same as its fellow [21:<small>14</small>].

The <i>’alef</i> following the <i>ḥolem</i> is silent, as it is in “wine bottles” [Joshua 9:<small>4</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn478"><b>[22]</b> The concept of <b>remember that you were a slave</b> is associated with the concept of being an “alien” [:<small>21</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn479"><b>[25:<small>1</small>]</b> The implied subject of <b>they will judge them</b> is “the judges”. Compare, “one may not take for security the lower millstone…” [<i>comment on</i> 24:<small>6</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn480"><b>[2]</b> In the phrase <b>deserves flogging</b> the Hebrew word <i>bin</i> is vocalized with a <i>ḥiriq</i>, as it is in the phrases “the son of Nun” [Joshua 1:<small>1</small>], and “the son of Yaqeh” [Proverbs 30:<small>1</small>]. It is used in the sense of “a base man” [I Samuel 25:<small>17</small>] and, similarly, “it was a creature of a night” [Jonah 4:<small>10</small>]. The reason he deserves to be flogged must be, in my opinion, that he struck his companion. <b>The judge will</b> not <b>stretch him down</b> personally, but it will be done at the judge’s command. The word <b>he will flog him</b> is to be understood similarly, as evidenced by <b>in his presence. the amount</b> of floggings <b>that he deserves for his guilt</b> Were it not for the words of the tradition [Makkot 22a], which alone are true, it would otherwise appear to us that there are some crimes which deserve ten lashes, and others twenty, or various other greater or lesser amounts (as evidenced by the phrase <b>that he deserves for his guilt</b>), as long as one does not exceed forty lashes (some people have proposed that the phrase <b>the amount that he deserves for his guilt</b> denotes lashes that may be either strong or gentle, albeit they are always forty in number).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn481"><b>[3]</b> The reason Divine justice demands that he suffer forty lashes, is that <b>your brother</b> not <b>be degraded</b> — for everyone will know that the punishment was a decree from G<small>OD</small>, and was not subject to the discretion of the judge.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn482"><b>[4]</b> The Dissenters assert, needlessly, that the “while” in the word <b>while it is threshing</b> indicates that the prohibition applies even if one muzzles the ox <i>before</i> it goes out to thresh. They also claim
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn483"><b>[5]</b> that the phrase <b>when brothers dwell together</b> denotes close relatives, but <i>not</i> actual brothers. They bring the case of Bo<sup>⊂</sup>az [<i>cf.</i> Ruth 3:<small>9</small>; Ruth 3:<small>13</small>] as evidence. This is vacuous, however, because no mention is made there of the word <i>yibbum</i> [here translated as “acting as the husband’s brother” — Translator], only of “redemption” [<i>cf.</i> Leviticus 25:<small>25</small>]. Besides, what, then, is the meaning of the word <b>together</b>? That they live in the same country? In the same courtyard? That they are fond of each other? The Dissenters claim further that the Scriptural usage of the term <b>act as her husband’s brother</b> proves that she is his brother’s wife in name only, but not in fact, as in the phrase “your brother’s wife has returned” [Ruth 1:<small>16</small>]. But they have stumbled into error. Note that regarding the sons of Y<sup>ǝ</sup>hudah, Scripture explicitly says, “act as her husband’s brother” [Genesis 38:<small>8</small>], although there he clearly <i>already was</i> her husband’s brother. Even the abovementioned use of the word “your brother’s wife” can be understood on the grounds that the two women were married to two brothers. ¶ Every sensible person knows that, although the prohibitions that were told to Moshe were not forbidden beforehand, if someone before the time of Moshe refrained from engaging in such actions he would not have displeased G<small>OD</small>. Scripture even states, “for the men of the land who preceded you practiced all these abominations” [Leviticus 18:<small>27</small>], and yet we have no evidence that any prophet had ever admonished them against such actions. With respect to Onan Scripture specifically says that he did not “provide progeny for his brother” [Genesis 38:<small>9</small>] and consequently “it was evil in the sight of G<small>OD</small>” [Genesis 38:<small>10</small>]. For these reasons, we will rely on the tradition that actual brothers are meant here. <b>childless</b> For there is no need to perform the ritual [<i>cf</i>. :<small>7<i>ff</i></small>] if he had a child, since the widow is then forbidden [Leviticus 18:<small>16</small>]. <b>together</b> is to be understood as the Exegetes have spoken [Yevamot 17b]. Even if the husband’s brother consents, she may not marry <b>outside</b> (i.e., <b>a strange man</b>).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn484"><b>[6]</b> With respect to <b>the first son that she bears,</b> the statement that he will bear the brother’s name, and the subsequent assurance that <b>his name will not be extinct,</b> both refer to <i>inheritance</i>, not the actual name of the child. I have already discussed the phrase <b>that she bears</b> in my comment on the phrase “to a foreign nation” [Exodus 21:<small>8</small>] [the reference is to an earlier commentary on Exodus, known as the <i>Perush Haqqaṣar</i> — Translator].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn485"><b>[7]</b> The second <i>yod</i> in the word <b>to fulfill the duty of the husband’s brother toward me</b> denotes the direct object of the verb.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn486"><b>[8]</b> He <b>stands up and says</b> in order to be heard by the elders.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn487"><b>[9]</b> The Hebrew word <b>unlace</b> also implies “pull off”, as in “pull out the breast” [Lamentations 4:<small>3</small>]. Our traditional sources inform us [<i>Sifrey</i> on this verse] that the word <b>facing him</b> here has the sense of “in his presence” [and <i>not</i> that she must spit in his face — Translator]. In fact, the most straightforward interpretation is “facing <i>it</i>” — i.e., facing the shoe. Compare, “written on <i>its</i> face and on its back” [Ezekiel 2:<small>10</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn488"><b>[11] When men fight</b> The opposite of the previous passage’s “When brothers dwell together” [:<small>5</small>]. These people may be brothers, or total strangers, <b>his pudenda</b> i.e., his testicles (from “pudency”). Not only is it brazenness to uncover the genitalia, which must be covered, but it is also a vulnerable spot.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn489"><b>[12]</b> The phrase <b>you shall cut off her hand</b> must be interpreted the same way as “an eye for an eye” [<i>cf. comment on</i> Exodus 21:<small>24</small>; <i>comment on</i> Leviticus 24:<small>20</small>]: if she does not pay compensation, her hand deserves to be cut off. <b>You must have no pity</b> if she is poor.

This term denotes the place where one keeps one’s scales.

or

It refers to one’s pocket, from which one surreptitiously removes a false weight.

The former interpretations seems to be the correct one, as evidenced by “we shall all have one lode” [Proverbs 1:<small>14</small>] — meaning, a single mass, as in “you will measure out the lamb” [Exodus 12:<small>4</small>] (even though the latter word stems from a slightly different triliteral root). Other people have unnecesarily interpreted the word to mean “purse”.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn491"><b>[15] a perfect</b> [Literally: complete] <b>weight</b> I.e., it may not be hollow anywhere. <b>a … just <sup>⊃</sup><i>efa</i> measurement</b> means one that is exactly the same volume as the market standard. <b>so that your days will be long</b> It is well known that every rightous society will endure; for rightousness is like a building, whereas deceit is like a destructive force, which can topple a wall in an instant.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn492"><b>[16]</b> The phrase <b>everyone who does such things</b> refers back to the abovementioned “two weights” [:<small>13</small>] and “two <sup>⊃</sup><i>efa</i> measurements” [:<small>14</small>]; but Scripture then generalizes to <b>everyone who practices deceit:</b> whether in word, or in deed; whether in private, or in public.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn493"><sup>1</sup>The definitive evidence is Ruth [Ruth 4:<small>13</small>]. The verse that states, “you shall not have intercourse with them” [I Kings 11:<small>2</small>] concerns only women of the Seven Canaanite Nations; similarly, the verse in Ezra’s book, “they separated all the mixed multitude” [Nehemiah 13:<small>3</small>] meant only the Ammonite and Moabite <b><i>males</i></b>, as I have there explained [the referenced passage is absent in all known editions of ibn Ezra’s commentary on Nehemiah — Translator].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn494"><sup>1</sup>The grammar of the Hebrew language requires that the <i>ḥiriq</i> of the future tense be replaced by a <i>tsereh</i> whenever a <i>nif‘al</i> verb is formed from a triliteral root beginning with any of the letters <i>’alef</i>, <i>ḥet</i>, <i>‘ayin</i>, <i>heh,</i> or <i>resh.</i> See “it shall not be treasured [Hebrew: <i>ye’aṣer</i>] nor be laid up [Hebrew: <i>yeḥasen</i>]” [Isaiah 23:<small>18</small>], “shall be slain [Hebrew: <i>yehareg</i>]” [Lamentations 2:<small>20</small>], “shall be worked [Hebrew: <i>ye‘aved</i>]” [21:<small>4</small>], and “all your males must appear [Hebrew: <i>yera’eh</i>]” [16:<small>16</small>].

<p><sup><xref rid="fn575">[69]</xref></sup>These are the words of the covenant which G<small>OD</small> commanded Moshe to enact with the Children of Israel in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant which He made with them in Ḥorev.</p>

The word <b>enfeebled</b> [Hebrew: <i>neḥ<sup>ə</sup>shalim</i>] is probably the same as the word <i>neḥ<sup>ə</sup>lashim</i> <sup><xref rid="fn582">1</xref></sup>. The two consonants transpose, as in “sheep” [Hebrew: <i>keves̀</i>] [Leviticus 4:<small>32</small>] and “lamb” [Hebrew: <i>kes̀ev</i>] [Leviticus 3:<small>7</small>]. <b>you were weak</b> They had just arrived at R<sup>ə</sup>fidim [Exodus 17:<small>8</small>], where the people thirsted after water (for so it is written [Exodus 17:<small>3</small>]). The phrase <b>feared not</b> refers to <sup>⊂</sup>Amaleq. The verb is in the perfect tense, as in “it was too difficult for you” [Exodus 18:<small>18</small>], “when Isaac was old” [Genesis 27:<small>1</small>], and “as he used to enjoy” [Genesis 27:<small>9</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn496"><b>[19]</b> The phrase <b>when</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>your God grants you rest</b> indicates that this commandment applies only after they take possession of the land, and the wars have subsided on all fronts. As long as they are engaged in war against their neighbors, they are not obliged to fight <sup>⊂</sup>Amaleq. <b>blot out the memory of <sup>⊂</sup>Amaleq</b> This is the same as [I Samuel 15:<small>3</small>] “kill man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep” (in order that no one might say “This ox was part of the booty from <sup>⊂</sup>Amaleq”). The wording of the Torah is general, and the words of the prophet Samuel provided the specifics. The phrase <b>you must not forget</b> adds emphasis to the word “Remember” [:<small>17</small>], as in many other commandments of the Torah.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn497"><b>[26:<small>1</small>] When you enter</b> After previously saying “when G<small>OD</small> grants you rest” [25:<small>19</small>], G<small>OD</small> now states that there are other commandments which apply <i>before</i> “G<small>OD</small> grants you rest” — in fact, as soon as <b>you enter the land</b> — namely, first-fruits [:<small>2</small><i>ff</i>], tithes [:<small>12</small><i>ff</i>], the writing of the Torah on stones [27:<small>2</small><i>ff</i>], the building of an altar [27:<small>5</small><i>ff</i>], and the recitation of the blessing and the curse upon the two mountains [27:<small>12</small><i>ff</i>].

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn499"><b>[3]</b> The phrase <b>in those days</b> means that the obligation is in force as long as there is a High Kohen. <b>I declare</b> out loud, so that the young ones will hear. The verb may also denote “to acknowledge” — i.e., thanking G<small>OD</small> that He fulfilled his promise — and this interpretation is supported by the presence of the fruit.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn500"><b>[5] you shall reply</b> Apparently the kohanim say something to the effect of, “What is this that you have brought?” — consequently, <b>you shall reply.</b> But the verb can also denote initiating a conversation, as in the first appearance of “Job declared” [Job 3:<small>2</small>] [<i>cf. comment on</i> Exodus 15:<small>21</small>]. <b>lost</b> is an intransitive verb. If the <b>Aramean</b> referred to Lavan, then the verb would be in the transitive <i>hif‘il</i> or <i>pi‘el</i> form. Besides, what sense is there to say, “Lavan tried to destroy my forefather, and he went down to Egypt”? Lavan never considered going down to Egypt! The plausible interpretation is that the <b>Aramean</b> refers to Ya<sup>⊂</sup>aqov, as if Scripture had said, “When my forefather was in Aramea, he was lost” — meaning, he was a pauper, without property. Compare, “give strong drink to him who is lost” [Proverbs 31:<small>6</small>], where it is immediately followed by, “let him drink, and forget his poverty” [Proverbs 31:<small>7</small>]. Thus the <b>lost Aramean</b> <i>was</i> <b>my forefather.</b> The intent of this passage is: I did not inherit this land from my forefather, for he was a pauper when he came to Aramea, and he was a stranger in Egypt, where he was <b>few in number.</b> Afterwards, he became a <b>great nation;</b> and <i>you,</i> G<small>OD</small>, brought us out of slavery, and gave us the good land. Do not object to Ya<sup>⊂</sup>aqov’s being called an <b>Aramean,</b> since similar apellations can be found. Consider “Yeter the Ishmaelite” [I Chronicles 2:<small>17</small>], even though he was really an Israelite (for so it is written [II Samuel 17:<small>25</small>]). The word <b>folk</b> must be in the construct case, because it never appears in the singular form. In its normal form (e.g., “menfolk” [Deuteronomy 2:<small>34</small>]) it is a plural noun.<sup><xref rid="fn583">1</xref></sup>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn501"><b>[7] poverty</b> means lack of wealth, whereas <b>toil</b> refers to the building projects. <b>distress</b> as in, “they rushed them, saying, ‘fulfill your task’” [Exodus 5:<small>13</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn502"><b>[11] you, and the Levite, and the alien</b> means that you are obliged to gladden them with the fruit of the earth.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn503"><b>[12]</b> The verb <b>disposing of the tithes</b> is in a unique form of the <i>hif‘il</i> construction. <b>The year of the tithe</b> i.e., the tithe of the poor. <b>to the Levite, the alien, the orphan, and to the widow</b> i.e., to anyone you wish from among these categories.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn504"><b>[13] I have removed that which is holy</b> i.e., the tithe. Moreover, I have not stored it up; rather, <b>I have given it</b> to those to whom I am obliged to give it. <b>I have not violated</b> intentionally. <b>neither have I forgot</b> to distribute the tithe. (It is also possible that these two verbs refer respectively to the two different tithes.)
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn505"><b>[14] I have not eaten it in my mourning</b> as in “son of my mourning” [Genesis 35:<small>18</small>] or “bread of mourners [Hosea 9:<small>4</small>].” This word’s meaning (to which I alluded in my treatise on the Hebrew language) is the same as “while I was mourning” — to wit: I did not eat anything sanctified as the tithe, while I was in mourning. <b>Neither did I remove any of it</b> In other words, I did not waste anything holy <b>when ritually impure</b> — i.e., <i>on anything that was</i> ritually impure. <b>for a dead person</b> here means for the <i>needs</i> of a dead person (although some people believe that this term is an oblique reference to idolatry). ¶ The reason behind all of these declarations is that it is forbidden to bring out one’s produce for any purpose whatever before first giving away the tithe, which is holy. It would be disrespectful to use the remainder of the produce first, even if one were to use it for a ritually impure purpose. And just as I have carefully guarded my produce, in order to extract the holy portion therefrom,

The Spaniard Rabbi Y<sup>ə</sup>hudah HaLevy — may he be for us a light from above! — cleverly explained how the word is related to the verb “to say”: the sense of the passage is that you have done all that is proper, to the point that you <i>cause other people to say</i> “He will be your God”;
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn509"><b>[18]</b> and He will likewise act toward you so as to cause you to say that you will be <b>His treasured people.</b> According, the verb “to bespeak” takes both a direct and an indirect object.

The latter group, however, was two tribes short, because Leah had had so many sons; so the oldest and the youngest of Leah’s sons were chosen to join the sons of the maidservants. <b>shall respond</b> see my comment on “You shall reply and say” [26:<small>5</small>]. Our Sages, of blessed memory, have asserted [Soṭa 32a] that this verb indicates that they also uttered blessings corresponding to each of the curses (e.g., “Blessed be the man who does not make a graven or molten image”, <i>et cetera</i>). But the plain sense of the passage is that the abovementioned “blessing” [:<small>12</small>] refers to the passage “Blessed be you in the city…” [28:<small>3</small><i>ff</i>] whereas the “curse” refers to the contrary passage [28:<small>16</small><i>ff</i>].

If a judge were to pervert the justice of others, they would appeal against him, and thus subject him to public scrutiny. But aliens, orphans and widows have no power.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn526"><b>[25]</b> According to many people, <b>he who takes a bribe</b> denotes a judge; but in my opinion, it denotes a false witness.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn527"><b>[26]</b> Some people claim that the verse <b>who will not fulfill…</b> refers to the entire Torah. Others claim that it only denotes the abovementioned prohibitions; but these people have spoken vacuously, since Scripture proceeds to say <b>and practice them.</b> In my opinion, having already cursed all those who violate the abovementioned <i>negative</i> commandments, Scripture now curses all those who secretly violate the <i>positive commandments.</i> That is why Scripture uses the form <b>and practice them.</b>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn528"><b>[28:<small>1</small>] elevated above all the nations of the world</b> This is the blessing in its general form: that there will be no nation in the world like you.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn532"><b>[5]</b> The word <b>breadbasket</b> normally means the place where bread is stored, but to put it before the word <b>kneading-trough</b> appears to be a violation of chronological order. Here it might mean the place where flour is stored.

to celebrate the festivals, or to conduct commerce, or to bring in the spoils of battle;

or

all everyday comings and goings (meaning, you will succeed in everything you do — <i>cf.</i> the subsequent passage [:<small>20</small>], where the reverse of this blessing is stated explicitly).

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn535"><b>[8]</b> The context of the word <b>warehouses</b> indicates that it must mean “storehouses”, or something similar.

Having previously mentioned “will grant you overabundance”, Scripture proceeds to mention rain, the lack of which is the primary cause of famine, <b>you will lend to many nations</b> when <i>they</i> experience hunger; but there will never come a time when <b>you will borrow.</b> ¶ All of these blessings fall under the generality that

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn540"><b>[14]</b> The core principle is not to depart from following G<small>OD</small>, and thereby engage in idolatry; for idolatry — i.e., the denial of God — is the root of all transgressions.

However, some say that it has the opposite meaning, and that it means to render something thin. <b>mildew</b> means the same in Hebrew as it does in Arabic. ¶ Some people say that the term <b>blasting</b> (as well as the cognate term “bloated by the East wind” [Genesis 61:<small>6</small>]) denotes a plant disease. Their evidence is that the same word appears in the verse “I have smitten you with blasting and mildew” [Amos 4:<small>9</small>], and also that the current instance is immediately followed by

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn544"><b>[24] powder and dust</b> due to the great dehydration [:<small>22</small>] and the powerful winds. The verb <b>you are destroyed</b> appears here in a rare conjugation (like, “on the day that you were created” [Ezekiel 28:<small>13</small>]).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn545"><b>[25]</b> The consonants of the word <b>horror</b> are reversed, as in “sheep” [Hebrew: <i>keves̀</i>] [Leviticus 4:<small>32</small>] and “lamb” [Hebrew: <i>kes̀ev</i>] [Leviticus 3:<small>7</small>].

The truth is that this word, like all the others, is the name of some specific disease; however, in this case the word has no cognate from which we can ascertain its meaning.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn549"><b>[29] you will grope</b> Scripture elaborates on the abovementioned “blindness” [:<small>28</small>]. In Hebrew, the verb <b>succeed</b> takes a direct object. <b>oppressed and robbed</b> by the enemy, <b>and none will come to your aid.</b>

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn559"><b>[40] annoint</b> from “nor did I annoint myself at all” [Daniel 10:<small>3</small>]. Scripture describes the situation that is the opposite of “oil upon your head” [Ecclesiastes 9:<small>8</small>]. The verb <b>will drop off</b> is in the <i>nif‘al</i> form.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn560"><b>[42] appropriate</b> is a verb in the <i>pi‘el</i> form. It has the sense of “to drive out nations” [4:<small>38</small>]. The word <b>locust</b> stems from a quadriliteral root, and it has no cognate; its meaning must be taken from context.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn561"><b>[43] higher and higher</b> The adverb is doubled, possibly to indicate

that there will be no one higher than he

or

that the rise will be continuous.

The same can be said of <b>lower and lower.</b> But it may be that the repetition indicates a simple intensification.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn562"><b>[44] he will be ahead</b> along the lines of “the borrower is servant to the lender” [Proverbs 22:<small>7</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn563"><b>[46] a sign</b> from G<small>OD</small>, reminding you of your rebellion against Him.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn564"><b>[47] an abundance of everything</b> denotes either everything that you might desire, or everything that you need.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn565"><b>[49] swoop</b> a manner of flying, as in “he soared on the wings of the wind” [Psalms 18:<small>11</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn566"><b>[53] you will eat your own children</b> during the siege. <b>will press</b> [<i>singular</i>] <b>you</b> i.e., <i>each one</i> of your enemies will press you. It is equally plausible, though, that the noun “enemy” is singular, and that it appears to assume the plural form here simply because it falls at the end of a verse.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn567"><b>[54]</b> The antecedent of the verb <b>he has spared</b> is either the enemy, or some-one who spared the children by hiding them (such an act having been necessitated by the circumstances of the siege).

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn570"><b>[59]</b> The word <b>your plagues</b> has elements of the singular form and of the plural form, in combination. Compare, “this testimonies of mine that I shall teach them” [Psalms 132:<small>12</small>].

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn571"><b>[61] bring</b> from “brought” [Jeremiah 16:<small>14</small>] (even though there the <i>‘ayin</i> is vocalized with a <i>ḥaṭaf segol</i>). Others say that the word is to be understood in its Aramaic sense, meaning “bring”.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn572"><b>[63] as He rejoiced</b> Do not think that anything can harm G<small>OD</small>, or that He suffers (see, “if you are righteous, what do you give Him?” [Job 35:<small>7</small>]). <b>you will be removed</b> is a <i>peh-nun</i> verb in the <i>nif‘al</i> form.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn574"><b>[68]</b> The word <b>you will sell yourselves</b> has a different meaning from the word “you will be sold” [e.g., Isaiah 50:<small>1</small>]. It means that you will attempt to sell your own selves — both men and women. However, <b>none will buy</b> you.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn575"><b>[69]</b> G<small>OD</small> had previously commanded that this covenant be enacted in the plains of Mo<sup>⊃</sup>av.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn576"><b>[29:<small>1</small>] Moshe summoned all Israel</b> for the purpose of ratifying the covenant. Accordingly, this passage is immediately followed by the passage “You are standing assembled today…” [:<small>9</small>]. <b>You have seen,</b> as well as the subsequent verse “I led you…” [:<small>4</small>] and the subsequent mention of how ‘Og came out to wage war [:<small>6</small>] are to be understood in the sense of, <i>“There are among you</i> those who have witnessed
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn577"><b>[2] the signs</b> which G<small>OD</small> performed in Egypt; both they and the next generation have witnessed the wonder of eating no bread other than the manna; and the younger generation witnessed how G<small>OD</small> aided them in the defeat of the two kings”.

G<small>OD</small> <b>has not given you</b> The idea is expressed in this way, not only because He is the First Cause of <i>all</i> things, but also, more specifically, because they eventually noticed how they did not require bread or wine [<i>cf.</i> :<small>5</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn579"><b>[4]</b> I have already commented on the statement that their garments <b>did not wear away</b> [<i>comment on</i> 8:<small>4</small>].

Here, too, the meaning of the passage is “your chiefs, (namely, they who are the chiefs) of your tribes” (as in the similar passage “and their glory was lost, [the glory] of Ḥeshbon” [Numbers 21:<small>30</small>] [this is one of two different explanations for that verse which ibn Ezra there offers — Translator]). The intent of this passage is to mention the leaders first, and then the elders, and then the officers, and afterwards <b>all the men of Israel</b> (i.e., the males), followed by
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn586"><b>[10]</b> the (male) children, and then the women, and finally, the aliens.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn587"><b>[11] to cross over</b> a verbal noun. The word is used in its idiomatic sense (<i>cf.</i> “they passed between its sections” [Jeremiah 34:<small>18</small>]). Note that when not followed by the preposition <b>into,</b> the word has the exact opposite meaning.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn588"><b>[13] Not with you alone</b> but rather, with you, and with those who shall come after you: your children, and your children’s children.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn589"><b>[14]</b> The <i>nun</i> in the word <b>is</b> is extraneous. <b>with him who is not</b> that is to say, with him who is not here now, but who shall come after us. The passage is not to be understood according to those who claim [<i>cf.</i> Shabbat 146a] that the “spirits” of the unborn were present.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn590"><b>[15] you have known…</b> There are some among you who have witnessed the abominations of <b>Egypt</b> (i.e., their gods), and <i>all</i> of you have witnessed the abominations of the other <b>nations. you have passed</b> i.e., you passed <i>by</i> them, namely, <sup>⊃</sup>Edom, <sup>⊂</sup>Ammon, Mo<sup>⊃</sup>av, and Midian.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn591"><b>[17] developing into hemlock and wormwood</b> Hemlock is harmful to someone who is healthy, and the illnesses that it produces are among the deadliest.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn592"><b>[18] this curse</b> “Cursed be the man who makes a graven or molten image…” [27:<small>15</small>]. <b>bless himself</b> Rabbi Y<sup>ə</sup>hudah HaLevy, of blessed memory, said that the word “bless himself” should be taken literally: When he hears the malediction, in his heart he will consider himself blessed, thinking <b>all will be well with me.</b> In other words, he will hear the ban, but think to himself, “I am an exception”. <b>that it be included</b> [Hebrew: <i>s<sup>ə</sup>fot</i>]
1) Rabbi Y<sup>ə</sup>hudah HaLevy — may he be for us a light from above! — said that this word has the meaning of “termination” (as in “will you destroy…” [Hebrew: <i>tispeh</i>] [Genesis 18:<small>23</small>]). The man engaged in blessing himself intends to nullify the words of the righteous — here denoted by the word <b>moist</b> — by means of the words of the “thirsty” (the righteous man is called <b>moist,</b> along the lines of “like a tree planted by the water” [Jeremiah 17:<small>8</small>], whereas a wicked man is called <b>thirsty,</b> along the lines of “like a juniper bush in the desert” [Jeremiah 17:<small>6</small>]). Likewise, he thinks that by blessing himself, he can cancel out the malediction. All this would have been a fine explanation — were it not for the fact that <b>moist</b> is an adjective; the verse would have to read “…moisture with thirst”.
2) The grammarian Rabbi Yona ibn Janaḥ explained the verse to mean: Since he sees that the innocent are destroyed the same as the wicked, he decides in his heart to be wicked. This cannot be right, though, on account of the phrase <b>all will be well with me.</b>
In my opinion, the word <b>included</b> [Hebrew: <i>s<sup>ə</sup>fot</i>] denotes an accretion, as in “that sin be added [Hebrew: <i>s<sup>ə</sup>fot</i>]” [Isaiah 30:<small>1</small>]. The meaning is: “all will be well with me, even though I follow the evil impulses of my heart, because I will survive through the merit of the righteous; they are many, whereas I am just a single sinner”. For this reason, Scripture immediately says,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn593"><b>[19]</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>will not consent to pardon him</b> — that is, he will be instantly destroyed.<sup><xref rid="fn617">1</xref></sup> The image is of something wet <i>adding</i> moisture to something parched. Scripture compares the righteous man to land that is watered (as in, “like a tree planted by streams of water” [Psalms 1:<small>3</small>]) and the wicked man to land that is parched (as in “like a juniper bush in the desert” [Jeremiah 17:<small>6</small>]). Evidence for this interpretation is provided by the beginning of the passage: “a root developing into hemlock and worm-wood” [:<small>17</small>] — which only occurs in a dry area. <b>wrath will fume</b> The fire of wrath shall bum him until smoke appears. If he is an individual, he will die immediately; if it is a whole family, then <b>all of the curse will alight</b> — i.e., the curse shall alight upon that family, until its name is obliterated; if
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn594"><b>[20]</b> it is a whole tribe, then G<small>OD</small> <b>will single it out for disaster.</b> Each enumerated consequence applies to a different possibility, like “…shall be dedicated to G<small>OD</small>, and I shall offer it up for a burnt offering” [Judges 11:<small>31</small>], as I have explained [<i>comment on</i> Judges 11:<small>31</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn595"><b>[21] The future generation</b> denotes both <b>your children</b> and the foreigners who will observe <b>the plagues of the land.</b>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn596"><b>[22] brimstone…</b>

They will pray to G<small>OD</small> that all the land be scorched with brimstone and salt, as in the overthrow of the places mentioned.
Some commentators say, however, that the subsequent verb “they will say” [:<small>23</small>] does not introduce a new sentence, but that it is only a repetition of the previous verb “will say” [:<small>21</small>]. The verb is repeated, following the rules of Hebrew usage, because of the length of the intervening clause.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn597"><b>[24] They</b> i.e., the older generation <b>will answer.</b> The reason Scripture says <b>the God of their fathers</b> is that they abandoned that which both they and their fathers had known, to worship
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn598"><b>[25]</b> that which they had not known. I have already explained <b>not allotted to them</b> [<i>comment on</i> 4:<small>19</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn599"><b>[27]</b> The word <b>exiled</b> lacks the <i>nun</i> of the root n-t-sh because it is absorbed into the following consonant, in accordance with the rules of grammar. The words <b>to this day</b> are part of the quoted answer.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn600"><b>[28] the hidden matters …</b> that is, if someone practices idolatry in secret, it is <b>for</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>our God</b> — meaning, his judgment will be at the hand of G<small>OD</small>, Who will punish him; but if it be public, then we, and our descendants, are obliged to do what is written in the Torah. (Some have interpreted the verse as follows: “The hidden matters are for G<small>OD</small> our God, and the revealed matters. It is only for us to act according to the words of the Torah.” But this interpretation contains a <i>non sequitur.</i> What would be the point of mentioning it, in this context?)
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn601"><b>[30:<small>1</small>]</b> Having previously said that God “cast them into another land”, Scripture now proceeds to say, “but if you return to G<small>OD</small>, even though you be outside the Land of Israel,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn602"><b>[3]</b> G<small>OD</small> will restore your exiles.” Rabbi Y<sup>ə</sup>hudah ben David Ḥayyuj, the grammarian, is of the opinion that the <i>first</i> instance of the word “restore” means “grant rest”. The sense of the verse is: “He will provide respite to the captives, and grant them mercy; afterward, he will send them back, and gather them …”.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn603"><b>[4] the end of heaven</b> antipodal to the Land of Israel.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn604"><b>[6]</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>your God will circumsize</b> This is attributed to God, because He is the First Cause of all things. After having stated [:<small>2</small>], You will repent, and hearken unto His voice, Scripture proceeds to say, “and He will assist you; He will circumsize your heart, and the hearts of your children” — unlike a corporeal circumcision, which you must perform entirely on your own.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn605"><b>[9] will grant extra prosperity</b> as a result of placing all the maledictions on the enemies. <b>as He rejoiced over your ancestors</b> who inherited the land (Scripture is here addressing those who will be exiled from the land in the future).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn606"><b>[10] written in this Book of the Torah</b> for the basis of all the precepts are there, even though they may require interpretation by the tradition. This observance will not occur until the heart is whole; accordingly, <b>with all your heart</b> — since the commandment of “observance” involves one’s heart.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn607"><b>[11] wondrous either</b>

mysterious

or

a superhuman task, which you will be unable to perform

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn608"><b>[12] it is not in heaven</b> an elaboration on “wondrous” [:<small>11</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn609"><b>[13] beyond the sea</b> an elaboration on “distant” [:<small>11</small>]. Probably the Mediterranean sea is meant, which cannot be traversed lengthwise, due to the murkiness of its waters.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn610"><b>[14] in your mouth, and in your heart</b> The essence of all the commandments is in one’s heart; but they also entail deeds, so that one may recall them with the words of one’s mouth.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn611"><b>[15] life</b> i.e., longevity. <b>good</b> i.e., prosperity, and health, and honor. <b>death and evil</b> i.e., the reverse of the above.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn612"><b>[16] to love</b> this being the essential thing. <b>to walk in His ways</b> not to alter the path of deeds and duties which He has commanded you; and, if you should not know <i>why</i> the decrees and judgments were given — it is so that <b>you will live</b> (corresponding to the abovementioned “life” [:<small>15</small>]) and <b>multiply</b> (corresponding to the abovementioned “good” [:<small>15</small>]), which denotes physical increase, both of children, and of wealth.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn613"><b>[17] if your heart turns</b> for the heart is the essence. I have already explained the word <b>be drawn away</b> [<i>comment on</i> 4:<small>19</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn614"><b>[18] you will be utterly lost</b> This corresponds to the abovementioned “death” and “evil” [:<small>15</small>]. They, and their children, and their fortune, shall all perish. <b>you will not last long</b> This is the opposite of “G<small>OD</small> your God will bless you in the land” [:<small>16</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn615"><b>[19] the heaven and the earth</b> because they are permanent. Compare, “this stone shall be a witness to us” [Joshua 24:<small>27</small>] and “Hear, O mountains, G<small>OD</small>’s controversy” [Micah 6:<small>2</small>] [<i>see also comment on</i> 4:<small>26</small>]. <b>life and death</b> are respecified as <b>the blessing, and the curse.</b> Scripture then states, You have the ability to choose life. The phrase <b>that you may live</b> may mean living corporeally, or it may mean to live on in memory. Scripture then proceeds to explain that
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn616"><b>[20] to love</b> is the purpose of life. <b>He is your life</b> The subject of this proposition, to which the pronoun “he” refers, according to the commentators, is G<small>OD</small>’s voice. But in my opinion, it is G<small>OD</small> Himself — as the poet has said, God is “my salvation” [Psalms 18:<small>47</small>], “my God of kindness” [Psalms 59:<small>18</small>], “my shield” [Psalms 18:<small>3</small>], and “my sword” [<i>cf.</i> 33:<small>29</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn617"><sup>1</sup>Incidentally, this verse also supports my interpretation of “he will be forgiven” [Numbers 15:<small>28</small>].

<p><sup><xref rid="fn618">[31:1]</xref></sup>Moshe went and spoke the following to all Israel, <sup><xref rid="fn619">[2]</xref></sup>telling them, “I am a hundred twenty years old today. I can no longer go to and fro, and G<small>OD</small> has told me, ‘You shall not cross this Jordan.’ <sup><xref rid="fn620">[3]</xref></sup>G<small>OD</small> your God, He shall precede you. He will destroy these nations to make way for you; Joshua will lead you, as G<small>OD</small> has spoken. <sup><xref rid="fn621">[4]</xref></sup>G<small>OD</small> will deal with them as He dealt with Sihon and Og the kings of the Amorites, and their lands, whom He destroyed. <sup><xref rid="fn622">[5]</xref></sup>G<small>OD</small> will deliver them to you, and you will deal with them according to the entire instruction which I instructed you. <sup><xref rid="fn623">[6]</xref></sup>Be courageous and brave; be not afraid, neither be alarmed at them, for it is G<small>OD</small> your God Who walks with you; He will not fail you, nor forsake you.”</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn624">[7]</xref></sup>Moshe summoned Joshua, and said to him in the presence of all Israel: “Be courageous and brave, for you will enter with this people to the land which G<small>OD</small> promised to their fathers to give them, and you will divide it among them. <sup>[8]</sup>And it is G<small>OD</small> Who shall lead you; He will be with you, He will not fail nor forsake you; be not afraid nor cowardly.” <sup><xref rid="fn625">[9]</xref></sup>Moshe wrote down this Torah, and entrusted it to the kohanim, descendants of Levi, who had charge over the ark of G<small>OD</small>’s covenant, and to all the elders of Israel. <sup><xref rid="fn626">[10]</xref></sup>And Moshe instructed them, saying: “At the end of every seven years, at the appointed time of the Sabbatical year, during the Feast of Sukkoth, <sup>[11]</sup>when all the Israelites come, to appear before G<small>OD</small> your God in the holy place which He will choose, you shall read this Torah before all Israel, aloud. <sup><xref rid="fn627">[12]</xref></sup>Assemble the people — men, women, children, and your alien who lives within your gates — in order that they may hear, and in order that they may learn to respect G<small>OD</small> your God, and observe and practice all the words of this Torah. <sup>[13]</sup>And your children, who have not knowledge, shall hear, and shall learn to respect G<small>OD</small> your God, as long as you live in the land which you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn628">[14]</xref></sup>G<small>OD</small> said to Moshe: “Mark! The time for you to die is nearing. Summon Joshua, and present yourselves in the Tent of Assembly, and I will charge him.” So Moshe went with Joshua, and they presented themselves in the Tent of Assembly. <sup><xref rid="fn629">[15]</xref></sup>G<small>OD</small> appeared in the Tent in a column of cloud, and the column of cloud stopped at the entrance of the Tent. <sup><xref rid="fn630">[16]</xref></sup>G<small>OD</small> said to Moshe: “You are about to lie with your forefathers, and this people will arise and become faithless by following after the gods of the foreigners of the land, within which they are about to enter. They will forsake Me, and nullify my covenant which I made with them. <sup><xref rid="fn631">[17]</xref></sup>Then My anger will burn against them on that day; I will reject them, and I will conceal My Presence from them. They will be as fodder, and many calamities and troubles will reach them, and they will say on that day: ‘These calamities have reached us because our God is not among us.’ <sup><xref rid="fn632">[18]</xref></sup>And I shall utterly conceal My Presence on that day, for all the evil they they committed when they turned to other gods. <sup><xref rid="fn633">[19]</xref></sup>Now, then, write yourselves this poem; teach it to the children of Israel; place it into their mouths, in order that this poem may be a witness unto Me concerning the children of Israel. <sup><xref rid="fn634">[20]</xref></sup>For I shall bring them into the land which I promised to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall eat, be satisfied, and become prosperous, and turn to the idols and serve them, and they will provoke My anger because they nullifled My covenant. <sup><xref rid="fn635">[21]</xref></sup>Then when many calamities and troubles will reach them, this poem will respond before them, in witness. Let it never be forgot from the mouth of their descendants, because I know their proclivities and how they act even now, before I have brought them into the land which I have promised.” <sup><xref rid="fn636">[22]</xref></sup>Moshe wrote down this poem on that day, and taught it to the children of Israel. <sup>[23]</sup>He commanded Joshua the son of Nun, saying, “Be courageous and brave, for you will bring the children of Israel to the land which I promised them, and I shall be with you.” <sup><xref rid="fn637">[24]</xref></sup>When Moshe finished writing the words of this Torah in a book completing them to the very end, <sup><xref rid="fn638">[25]</xref></sup>Moshe instructed the Levites who carry the ark of G<small>OD</small>’s covenant, as follows: <sup><xref rid="fn639">[26]</xref></sup>“Take this Book of the Torah and place it along-side the ark of the covenant of G<small>OD</small> your God, so that it may remain there as a witness against you. <sup><xref rid="fn640">[27]</xref></sup>For I know your rebellious nature, and your stubbornness: even now, while I am yet alive with you, you have been rebellious against G<small>OD</small>, how much more so after my death! <sup>[28]</sup>Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers that I may speak these words directly to them, and I will call heaven and earth as witnesses against them. <sup><xref rid="fn641">[29]</xref></sup>For I know that, after my death, you will act corruptly, and turn away from the path which I have directed you. Then, at the end, suffering will befall you, for your having done what is evil before G<small>OD</small>, to provoke His anger through the work of your own hands.” <sup>[30]</sup>Moshe spoke aloud to the entire assembly of Israel these words of the poem to the very end.</p>
<ftnote id="fn618"><b>[31:<small>1</small>] went</b> He went to each tribe, to inform them that he was going to die, so that they would not be frightened, and to hearten them with respect to Joshua (this is the reason for the passage which immediately follows: “… you will divide it among them” [:<small>7</small>]). It is also my belief that this is when Moshe blessed the tribes, even though it is recorded later [<i>cf.</i> 33:<small>1</small><i>ff</i>.].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn619"><b>[2]</b> To <b>go to and fro</b> denotes going out to, and returning from, battle. In other words: “Even if I were not now going to die, still I am incapable of waging war. Thus, you have no need of someone who would leave you unattended. But rather,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn620"><b>[3]</b> G<small>OD</small> will destroy the nations, and Joshua also — and the proof is
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn621"><b>[4]</b> that which you have seen with your very eyes, namely, the war of Siḥon and ‘Og.”
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn622"><b>[5] and you will deal with them</b> i.e., to destroy their altars.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn623"><b>[6] Be courageous and brave</b> now that you know that G<small>OD</small> will stand with you in any place where you go to do battle. Moshe then said
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn624"><b>[7] be courageous and brave</b> to Joshua as well, because he was to be their leader. <b>for you will enter with</b> [Hebrew: <sup>⊃</sup><i>et</i>] <b>this people</b> The Hebrew word <sup>⊃</sup><i>et</i> here has the sense of “with”.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn625"><b>[9] entrusted it to the kohanim, descendants of Levi</b> because they are the teachers of the Torah. <b>to all the elders of Israel</b> This either denotes the Sanhedrin, or it is meant in the sense of “Moshe and the elders of Israel” [27:<small>1</small>] [i.e., “elders” denotes a group of unspecified people who are to assist the kohanim in their mission — Translator].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn626"><b>[10] at the end of every seven years</b> i.e., at the inception of the following year.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn627"><b>[12] your alien</b> Perhaps he desires to convert to Judaism. When those who are not learned (and the small children as well) will <b>hear,</b> they will ask questions; and as a consequence, they will <b>learn. in order that they may learn</b> for all of the coming year. The Torah reading on the Sabbath serves the same purpose.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn628"><b>[14] The time for you to die is nearing.</b> Everyone has his predestined times, as I have explained [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 23:<small>26</small>]. <b>Moshe went</b> from the Israelite camp, where he was, back to the camp of the Divine Presence.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn629"><b>[15]</b> The Hebrew word <b>in the Tent</b> contains the definite article. G<small>OD</small> <b>appeared in the Tent</b> The column of cloud was upon the entrance, to be distinguished from the epiphany of G<small>OD</small>, which took place within the Tent. The latter is what is meant by the term “the Glory” [e.g., Exodus 16:<small>10</small>]. All apparent references here to G<small>OD</small>’s speaking to Joshua — e.g., “I will charge him” [:<small>14</small>] — actually denote Moshe’s charging Joshua with G<small>OD</small>’s commandments [:<small>23</small>] (this is why Moshe says there, speaking in G<small>OD</small>’s name, “which I promised them” [:<small>23</small>]). Only afterwards did the passage of
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn630"><b>[16] You are about to lie with your forefathers</b> take place, since the Torah does not always record events in strict chronological order. Similarly, the passage “when Moshe completed writing” [:<small>24</small>] occurred immediately after the passage “Moshe wrote down this Torah” [:<small>9</small>].
<b>[16]</b> It is unlikely that the word <b>will arise</b> is part of the previous phrase [Sanhedrin 90b], because if it were, how then could one make sense out of the following words, <b>this people, and become faithless?</b> The word <b>become faithless</b> means to withdraw one’s loyalty. ¶ <b>after the gods of the nations of the land</b> As we all know, G<small>OD</small> is One. Any apparent alteration in His actions is due to alterations in the actedupon objects (for G<small>OD</small>’s actions do not change, since they are One with the Divine Intelligence). The purpose of all service to G<small>OD</small> is to preserve one’s capacity to receive Divine influence, each object according to its nature. It is in this sense that we must understand “the laws of the land’s God” [II Kings 17:<small>26</small>]. Similarly, Ya<sup>⊂</sup>aqov said “Remove the strange idols” [Genesis 35:<small>2</small>] [prior to entering the holy city of Bethel — Translator]. The alteration of Ya<sup>⊂</sup>aqov’s location also effected the extent to which God tolerated sexual relations which are forbidden on grounds of consanguinity — <i>verbum sat sapienti</i> [<i>cf. comment on</i> Leviticus 18:<small>26</small>]. The antecedent of <b>within which</b> [<i>masculine</i>] could be the noun <b>foreigner,</b> as if the verse had read, “…and become faithless by following after the gods of the foreign nations, they being the gods of the land…”. It is more likely, though, that the antecedent is the word <b>land,</b> which occasionally is found taking the masculine gender (compare, “the land could not support [<i>masculine</i>] them” [Genesis 13:<small>6</small>], and “the land is darkened” [Isaiah 9:<small>18</small>]).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn631"><b>[17] I will reject them</b> [<i>plural</i>] all of them. <b>They will be</b> [<i>singular</i>] Every one of them will be <b>as fodder</b> for the enemy.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn632"><b>[18] I shall utterly conceal</b> In the sense that if they call Me, I will not answer. The analogy is to a man who cannot be seen, so no one knows what he is going to do. The Hebrew language repeats a verb to express emphasis or intensification, as the grammarians well know. <b>they turned to</b> This is the greatest of all evils, as I have explained [<i>comment on</i> 28:<small>14</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn633"><b>[19] write yourselves</b> [<i>plural</i>] Not only Moshe, but also everyone who knows how to write, is commanded to do so [Sanhedrin 21b]. <b>teach it</b> i.e., he is to explain the difficult meanings to them. <b>place it into their mouths</b> that they should know it word for word. The word <b>teach it</b> (as well as the word <b>place it)</b> is unusual, because according to the rule, the <i>heh</i> ought to be vocalized with a <i>qamaṣ</i>, and the <i>daled</i> should be vocalized with a <i>segol.</i> <b>a witness concerning the children of Israel</b> Either

This is meant to be joined to the subsequent phrase

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn634"><b>[20] I shall bring them</b> — that is, the poem is a witness that I shall bring them.
or, more plausibly,

it is to be <i>contrasted</i> to that passage, on account of the subsequent

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn635"><b>[21] will respond</b> ([Hebrew: <i>v<sup>ə</sup></i><sup>⊂</sup><i>antah</i>] as in, “do not speak up [Hebrew: <i>ta</i><sup>⊂</sup><i><sup>ə</sup>neh</i>] against your neighbor as a false witness” [Exodus 20:<small>13</small>]). In other words: The poem will answer those who will say, “Why has all this befallen us?”
<b>before them</b> in the sense of “against them”. The meaning is that this testimony shall not depart from them, but shall remain with them always. <b>for I know their proclivities</b> Even if I did not know the future, I still know all that they have done up until today.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn636"><b>[22]</b> <b>on that day</b> means that he did not postpone the matter. In all likelihood, though, the day of his death was not the day when he began writing the Torah (for the writing of the poem was included in the writing of the entire Torah).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn637"><b>[24]</b> The phrase <b>completing them</b> [<i>plural</i>] refers to the <b>words</b> of the Torah.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn638"><b>[25] the Levites</b> Scripture employs brevity, as if it had specified, from among the abovementioned Levites, those who are kohanim — but not <i>all</i> of the Levites, since the latter may not touch the Ark. <b>who carry the ark of</b> G<small>OD</small>’s <b>covenant</b> here means, as in many other instances, that they do so only when commanded.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn639"><b>[26] so that it may remain there as a witness against you</b> i.e., against <i>all</i> of Israel, in which the kohanim are included.<sup><xref rid="fn642">1</xref></sup>

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn641"><b>[29]</b> The word <b>befall,</b> ending in a <i>tav,</i> is the third person feminine singular of a <i>lamed-’alef</i> verb, as in “it is your nation who has sinned” [Exodus 5:<small>16</small>], as I have there explained [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 5:<small>16</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn642"><sup>1</sup>Compare this to a passage [3:<small>18</small>] where Moshe addresses all of Israel, whereas in fact he means only the tribes of R<sup>ə</sup><sup>⊃</sup>uven and Gad (as I have explained [<i>comment on</i> 3:<small>18</small>]).

He surrounded him, He gave him wisdom, He guarded him as the pupil of His eye. <sup><xref rid="fn653">[11]</xref></sup>Like an eagle stirring his nest, hovering over his young, spreading his wings, taking him, carrying him on his plumes — <sup><xref rid="fn654">[12]</xref></sup>G<small>OD</small> alone led him, and there was no other power with him. <sup><xref rid="fn655">[13]</xref></sup>He conveyed him to the heights of the earth, where he ate the produce of the field; suckled him on honey from the stone, and oil from the flint of a rock. <sup><xref rid="fn656">[14]</xref></sup>The fat of cattle, the milk of sheep. with the suet of lambs, and rams of the Bashan breed, and billy goats, with fat kidneys of wheat; you drank the blood of the grape for wine. <sup><xref rid="fn657">[15]</xref></sup>Yeshurun grew fat, and kicked. You grew fat, you thickened, you became covered.

For He will avenge the blood of His servants. He will return vengeance upon His adversaries, and atone His land, His people.”</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn686">[44]</xref></sup>Moshe came and spoke aloud to the people all the words of this poem, he and Hoshea the son of Nun. <sup>[45]</sup>When Moshe had finished speaking all these words to all Israel, <sup>[46]</sup>he said to them, “Be mindful of the words to which I testify today, that you instruct your children to observe and to practice all the words of this Torah. <sup><xref rid="fn687">[47]</xref></sup>For it is not an empty matter for you — it is your life. By means of this thing shall you prolong your days upon the land toward which you are crossing the Jordan, to inherit.”</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn688">[48]</xref></sup>On that selfsame day, G<small>OD</small> spoke to Moshe, saying: <sup>[49]</sup>“Ascend through Mount ‘Avarim to Mount Nevo, which is at the land of Moab facing Jericho, and observe the land of Canaan which I give to the children of Israel for a possession. <sup><xref rid="fn689">[50]</xref></sup>And die on that mountain upon which you ascend, and be gathered unto your people, as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people. <sup><xref rid="fn690">[51]</xref></sup>Because you were false toward Me among the Children of Israel at the waters of Merivat-Qadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; in that you failed to sanctify Me among the children of Israel. <sup><xref rid="fn691">[52]</xref></sup>You shall see the land from across. But you shall not come thither, to the land which I give to the Children of Israel.”</p>
<ftnote id="fn643"><b>[32:<small>1</small>]</b> As I have already explained in <i>Sefer Moznayyim,</i> the word <b>listen</b> [Hebrew: <i>ha</i><sup>⊃</sup><i><sup>ɒ</sup>zinu</i>] comes from the word “ear” [Hebrew: <sup>⊃</sup><i>ozen</i>], as if to say, “incline your ear”. <b>heavens</b>

Sa‘adya Gaon, as I have previously indicated [<i>comment on</i> 4:<small>26</small>], understands this word metonymically, to refer to the angels. Similarly, <b>earth,</b> he says, denotes the <i>people</i> of the earth.

Alternately,

the reference is to the testimony of the rain, which falls from the heavens, and to the crops, which grow from the earth.

In my opinion, however, the point being made here

is that these things are permanent. Compare, “Hear, O mountains” [Micah 6:<small>2</small>]. Compare as well to Joshua’s stone, where the verse says, “for it has heard” [Joshua 24:<small>27</small>] [<i>cf. comment on</i> 4:<small>26</small>].

¶ Previously I have suggested that the human soul is a bridge between the spiritual and the corporeal. It understands everything — even the human soul itself — anthropomorphically: Things corporeal it elevates, and things spiritual it brings down to its own level of understanding.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn644"><b>[2] drop</b> as in, “He shall topple their altars” [Hosea 10:<small>2</small>], meaning “to fall down”. <b>my teaching</b> [Hebrew: <i>liqḥi</i>] i.e., that which another <i>takes</i> [Hebrew: <i>loqeaḥ</i>] from him. Compare, “good teaching [Hebrew: <i>leqaḥ</i>]” [Proverbs 4:<small>2</small>]. The word <b>showers,</b> in my opinion, denotes a milder kind of rain, whereas the word <b>downpours</b> [Hebrew: <i>r<sup>ə</sup>vivim</i>] (both words are adjectives) comes from the Hebrew word for “abundant” [Hebrew: <i>rav</i>], since the word <b>vegetation</b> generally denotes a stronger kind of plant than the word <b>grass.</b> Some say that the word <b>showers</b> comes from the word “hair”. Others have related it to “the storm wind of G<small>OD</small>” [Jeremiah 23:<small>19</small>], albeit the former is spelled with a <i>s̀in</i> whereas the latter is spelled with a <i>samekh</i> (similarly, “shall come against him like a storm” [Daniel 11:<small>40</small>], is spelled with a <i>s̀in,</i> although its meaning is identical to the same word spelled with a <i>samakh</i>). It is also possible that the word simply has no cognate in Scripture. ¶ Employing the customary prophetic style, Scripture expresses the same idea twice, for emphasis, the idea being that Moshe prays for his words to fall like dew and rain. Dew and rain do not descend without effect; they never fall without, as it is written, “watering the earth” [Isaiah 55:<small>10</small>]. The idea is that Moshe’s words should enter the hearts of his audience in the same way that rain and dew enter the earth, causing it to bear life, and to flourish.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn645"><b>[3]</b> The words <b>ascribe greatness to our God</b> are addressed to the abovementioned heavens and earth. Compare, “the heavens declare the glory of God” [Psalms 19:<small>1</small>], as I have there elaborated [<i>comment on</i> Psalms 19:<small>1</small>]; similarly, “let the heaven and earth praise Him” [Psalms 69:<small>35</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn646"><b>[4]</b> Moshe begins with <b>the Rock Whose deeds are perfect</b> to indicate that any evil that has befallen Israel has been caused by their own evil deeds. <b>Rock</b> He endures forever, like a rock. Do not be amazed at the use of such an analogy, as they are common in Scripture (e.g., “Who shall roar like a lion” [Hosea 11:<small>10</small>]). It is impossible for us to describe G<small>OD</small> in any way other than in terms of His creations (for every thing that exists is His creation). Compare, “the Rock [Hebrew: <i>ṣur</i>] of my heart” [Psalms 73:<small>26</small>] — meaning support, strength, pillar. There are also those who say that the word comes from “form” (as in “their form [Hebrew: <i>ṣuram</i>] shall waste away in the grave” [Psalms 49:<small>15</small>]). Their thesis is that G<small>OD</small> has no substance, but is primal form. In my opinion, however, the former etymology is correct. <b>Whose acts are perfect</b> Every cause is an imperfect cause, on account of its dependence on its antecedent cause, except for G<small>OD</small>, the exalted Prime Cause of all. Everything in the universe can be acted upon, except He Who formed the universe. <b>for all His ways are lawful</b> They do not alter; they follow a unitary Law, which is the Origin of all. All created things alter their actions in accordance with their circumstances; but the actions of G<small>OD</small> are subject only to His wisdom (that the sun was made to stand still is no disproof; the intricacies of that situation are explained from the words “and the moon, in the valley of Ayyalon” [Joshua 10:<small>12</small>], as I have explained in its place [no copy of this commentary is known — Translator]). <b>a trustworthy Power, without injustice</b> I.e., only He is intrinsically powerful. Even the mightiest human achievements are dependent on circumstances to which others have contributed. The sense is

that <i>since</i> He is completely powerful, <i>therefore</i> it is not possible that He should do injustice.

or

The word <b>Power</b> is a nominative to which two separate descriptions [“trustworthy” and “without injustice”] are applied.

Scripture says <b>righteous and upright is He</b> on account of the upcoming phrase
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn647"><b>[5] To waste from Him,</b> meaning that it is His righteousness to lay waste a perverse nation. He alone is upright, and it is the nature of uprightness to straighten that which is crooked. Thus the word <b>from Him</b> means, those who had been His, in former times. [Here the interpretation begins to employ word groupings that are at variance with the cantillation marks — Translator] <b>not His sons</b> I.e., those who say that they are not His sons. Compare, “sons that are not trustworthy” [:<small>20</small>]. The meaning of the phrase is that they do not acknowledge Him as their Creator; or, if they acknowledge Him on their lips, they do not acknowledge Him in their heart, as evidenced by their not fearing G<small>OD</small>. The <i>lamed</i> in the word <b>from Him</b> is a preposition that takes a compound object. It also attaches to the word <b>their defect,</b> in the sense of “<i>because of</i> their defect” — namely, that they are <b>a generation crooked and perverse</b> (the word <b>perverse</b> means to be confirmed and ongoing in one’s crookedness. Compare, “all of God’s twisted ways” [Genesis 30:<small>8</small>]). ¶ Some say that the phrase <b>to waste from him</b> is to be understood as “to waste from <i>them</i>” — i.e., they wasted <i>themselves.</i> Do not question the use of the singular, because such is the nature of the Hebrew language. Do we not also have the verse, “Remember [<i>singular</i>] ancient days; study [<i>plural</i>] the years of each generation” [:<small>7</small>]? ¶ In my opinion, however, the correct interpretation is as follows: The object of the <b>waste</b> is G<small>OD</small> — in other words, they have perverted the ways of G<small>OD</small> which are innate, as well as the decrees which He has commanded — as if the verse had read, “A crooked generation, who are not His sons, has disregarded Him, this being their defect”. This interpretation is confirmed by the subsequent verse, <b>Shall you render this to</b> G<small>OD</small>. As for the letter <i>heh</i> which begins the verse, I have already explained its unusual size and vocalization in <i>Sefer Moznayyim.</i>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn648"><b>[6] vile</b> in its actions. <b>unwise</b> in its heart. Thus they are entirely defective: in thought, and in deed. Scripture uses the word <b>your Father</b> on account of their having said that they are not His sons. <b>your Owner</b> as in, <b>“G<small>OD</small></b> produced me” [Proverbs 8:<small>22</small>]. <b>He constituted you</b> I.e., he designed you. <b>and established you</b> I.e., made you capable of fulfilling the design.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn649"><b>[7] days</b> [Hebrew: <i>y<sup>ə</sup>mot</i>] Both this form and <i>y<sup>ə</sup>mey</i> [e.g.. Genesis 3:<small>14</small>] are valid forms of this word, just as <b>years</b> [Hebrew: <i>sh<sup>ə</sup>not</i>] and <i>sh<sup>ə</sup>ney</i> [e.g., Genesis 23:<small>1</small>] are both valid forms of the word. <b>ancient</b> [literally: eternity] here denotes the past. <b>ask your father</b> Having just a moment ago said <b>remember,</b> Scripture now continues: But if you have <i>forgot</i> what your fathers related to you, then <b>ask</b> them. <b>he will tell you</b> Scripture employs a pronomial suffix, even though the verb normally takes an indirect object, requiring a preposition. Compare the pronomial suffixes in, “You have given <i>to</i> me a desert land” [Joshua 15:<small>19</small>], and “my children have gone out <i>from</i> me” [Jeremiah 10:<small>20</small>]. <b>your elders</b> The idea is repeated, in the manner of an admonition.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn650"><b>[8]</b> The traditional commentators have explained the passage beginning <b>When the Most High allotted inheritances to the peoples</b> as referring to the Generation of the Dispersion [<i>see Sifrey</i> on this verse]. It was during that time that the land became scattered, and it was then that G<small>OD</small> decreed that the land of the Seven Nations would be Israel’s (and that it would be sufficient to their population — hence, <b>to the number of the children of Israel).</b> Some people have asserted that <b>set</b> [Hebrew: <i>yaṣṣev</i>] is a verbal noun, like “Lo, I cannot speak [Hebrew: <i>dabber</i>]” [Jeremiah 1:<small>6</small>]. Others have suggested that it is a verb in the future tense taking the place of one in the past tense, as in “they made a calf in Ḥorev” [Psalms 106:<small>19</small>]. In my opinion, however, “ask your father” [:<small>7</small>] and “your elders” [:<small>7</small>] are references to the learned, and the meaning of the current passage is similar to that in “G<small>OD</small> has allotted them” [4:<small>19</small>] — namely, that to every component of the terrestrial world there is a corresponding component in the supernal world. Thus, <b>according to the number of the children of Israel</b> must be understood along the lines of the statement made by our Sages, of Blessed Memory, that the image of Father Jacob is engraved on the Throne of Glory [<i>Midrash Tanḥuma</i> on Numbers 3:<small>40</small>] — this is a great secret teaching of the Torah. The evidence for this interpretation is the phrase
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn651"><b>[9]</b> G<small>OD</small>’<b>s share is His people;</b> and it is the greatest of all possible privileges, one which “He has done so for no other nation” [Psalms 147:<small>20</small>]. This is why Scripture asked “shall you render this to G<small>OD</small>, O vile and unwise people?” [:<small>6</small>] — that is, a people that has fallen from eminence through its own wrongdoing. This is the meaning of “your Father, your Owner” [:<small>6</small>] — i.e., He has acquired you for His glory. He then tutored you, as Scripture will illustrate, in the manner of a father with his son. <b>parcel</b> [<i>literally:</i> cord] meaning, “lot” (as in “the bounds” [Psalms 16:<small>6</small>]), because land parcels are measured out with cords [<i>cf.</i> Amos 7:<small>17</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn652"><b>[10] He found him in a wilderness land</b> Now begins the elaboration of “your Father, your Owner” [:<small>6</small>]. <b>He found him</b> because it was in the wilderness that the Glory was first joined to them. Moreover, they were in an area which no man had explored (for so it is written [Jeremiah 2:<small>6</small>]), and, since it was a wilderness, it encompassed a <b>waste-land. howling</b> a place where there is a howling of animals, like jackals and owls, whose sound terrifies anyone within earshot. <b>He surrounded him</b> a reference to the clouds. <b>He gave him wisdom</b> i.e., the Torah. <b>He guarded him</b> from enemies. <b>the pupil of his eye</b> I have already explained the word <b>pupil. eye</b> is an anthropomorphism. The meaning is that He protected them from every enemy and snare. The word <b>his young</b> denotes a bird’s little ones. Compare, “a turtle-dove, and a young [pigeon]” [Genesis 15:<small>9</small>]. The word <b>young</b> is a general term, like “bird”, modifying whatever specific term is employed to denote the species of the nestlings. <b>hovering</b> (<i>cf</i>. “was hovering” [Genesis 1:<small>2</small>]) as the clouds did over Israel, in their travels. <b>spreading his wings, taking him</b> [<i>singular</i>] He takes up the fledglings one at a time onto his plumes (since they cannot fly on their own power, that being the analogy here<sup><xref rid="fn692">1</xref></sup>).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn653"><b>[11] like an eagle stirring his nest</b> a transitive verb, meaning to convey from place to place.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn654"><b>[12] alone led him</b>
1) G<small>OD</small> alone (as in “at the word of G<small>OD</small> they encamped and … marched” [Numbers 9:<small>23</small>]) — meaning, G<small>OD</small> used no emissary.
2) It is also plausible that the word <b>alone</b> refers to Israel, as in “Behold, it is a nation dwelling alone” [Numbers 23:<small>9</small>].
<b>there was no other power with him</b> I.e., there was no other power with <i>Israel.</i> This interpretation is evidenced by the subsequent verse “They aroused His jealousy with strangers” [:<small>16</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn655"><b>[13] He conveyed him to the heights of the earth</b> I.e., the land of Canaan, which is the center of the inhabited earth. The word <b>he conveyed him</b> is a rhetorical form. <b>heights</b> [Hebrew: <i>bam<sup>ə</sup>tey</i>] (here written with an unvocalized <i>vav</i>) From “you shall tread on their towers [Hebrew: <i>bamoteymo</i>]” [33:<small>29</small>], <i>not</i> from “among the wicked … his tomb [Hebrew: <i>b<sup>ə</sup>motav</i>]” [Isaiah 53:<small>9</small>]. <b>the produce</b> meaning, the fruits. Compare, “if riches increase” [Psalms 62:<small>11</small>]. <b>of the field</b> [Hebrew: <i>s̀adai</i>] an adjective, vocalized as in “wise” [Hebrew: <i>ḥakham</i>], with a <i>yod</i> in place of a <i>heh</i> (like the <i>vav</i> in “I was at ease” [Job 16:<small>12</small>]), as evidenced by “let the field be joyful” [Psalms 96:<small>12</small>], where the singular form of the verb is used. <b>suckled him on honey from the stone</b> This is a figure of speech, like “the mountains shall drop down sweet wine” [Joel 4:<small>18</small>], meant to convey the abundance of honey, and of oil, which are exported from the land of Canaan (for so it is written [Ezekiel 27:<small>17</small>]). The <i>lamed</i> of <b>flint</b> is vocalized with a schwa, because the word is in the construct case — exactly the opposite of “a rock of flint” [8:<small>15</small>]. Similarly, “knives of stone” [Joshua 5:<small>2</small>] is the opposite of “the edge of his sword” [Psalms 89:<small>44</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn656"><b>[14] The fat of cattle</b> denotes the abundance of flesh. <b>the milk [Hebrew:</b> <i>ḥ<sup>ɒ</sup>lev</i>] <b>of sheep</b> Were it not for the traditional vocalization of the letters, this verse would be support for the suet controversy (which I mentioned in its place [<i>comment on</i> Leviticus 7:<small>23</small>]); alternately, <b>the suet</b> [Hebrew: <i>ḥelev</i>] <b>of lambs</b> could mean the best and thickest fat, as in “the choicest [Hebrew: <i>ḥelev</i>] of the oil” [Numbers 18:<small>12</small>]. <b>of the Bashan breed</b> who were raised on the hills of Bashan. <b>fat kidneys of wheat</b> This is a bit of imagery, bringing to mind the deposits of fat that surround the kidneys. Also, a kernel of wheat resembles a kidney in shape. <b>the blood of the grape</b> denotes wine. Scripture thus tabulates an abundandace of: honey; oil; flesh; bread; wine, and all manner of fruits (there are also some who say that the abovementioned “honey” denotes date-honey) — completing the description of “the produce of the field” [:<small>13</small>]. <b>wine</b> a synonym for “wine”. Compare, “a vineyard of wine” [Isaiah 27:<small>2</small>]. The <i>tav</i> in <b>you drank</b> denotes the second person masculine singular. It suggests a man speaking to his fellow, saying, “there is so much abundance, you will drink wine constantly”. There are those, however, who say that the <i>tav</i> denotes the third person feminine singular, and that <b>grape</b> acts as the feminine subject of the verb. This suggestion is vacuous, though, because it would require the <i>tav</i> to be vocalized with a <i>pattaḥ,</i> in the form of a causative <i>hif‘il</i> verb. A slightly more plausible reading is suggested by those who say that the feminine subject of the non-causative verb is the implied word “congregation”, since the congregation of Israel is sometimes masculine and sometimes feminine [e.g., I Samuel 17:<small>21</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn657"><b>[15] Yeshurun grew fat</b> i.e., Israel. Most likely the name is derived from the word “upright” [Hebrew: <i>yashar</i>], and the meaning of the verse is that he who had once been upright has become fat. Another opinion is that the name is related to “I gaze at it” [Hebrew: <i>ashurennu</i>] [Numbers 24:<small>17</small>]; but the former explanation, in my opinion, is the more just of the two, as evidenced by the verb’s being in the singular [since the latter explanation implies that the reason for the <i>yod</i> in <i>Yeshurun</i> is to indicate the third person masculine plural — Translator]. <b>and kicked</b> from “why do you kick” [I Samuel 2:<small>29</small>], where the meaning of the word can be understood from context. <b>You grew fat</b> and did not take it to heart. <b>you thickened</b> as in “my little finger will be thicker” [I Kings 12:<small>10</small>]. <b>you became covered</b> [Hebrew: <i>kas̀ita</i>] Some say that the word is related to “he has covered [Hebrew: <i>khissah</i>] his face with his fat” [Job 15:<small>27</small>], since the verb also appears in the <i>qal</i> form [e.g., Proverbs 12:<small>23</small>]. Others say that it is from “I wandered like a lamb [Hebrew: <i>k<sup>ə</sup>s̀eh</i>] gone astray” [Psalms 119:<small>176</small>] — except that there is no verbal form that uses an auxiliary <i>kaf.</i> The correct interpretation, in my opinion, is that this word has no cognate, and that its meaning is similar to “you kicked”. <b>He abandoned</b> the precepts of his God. <b>debased</b> in thought, and in word. Scripture says <b>the Rock of his salvation,</b> in all likelihood, to indicate that he desecrated the Name of the One Who, for that reason, did <i>not</i> confer upon him salvation. One can also apply the interpration of “The Rock Whose acts are perfect” [<i>comment on</i> 32:<small>4</small>] to the current passage.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn658"><b>[16] They aroused His jealousy</b> had they acted on their intentions. Compare, “and now nothing will be withheld from them” [Genesis 11:<small>6</small>]. <b>strangers</b> strange gods. <b>abominations</b> i.e., idols.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn659"><b>[17] to demons</b> See my commentary on “to the satyrs after which they stray” [<i>comment on</i> Leviticus 17<small>7</small>]. Similarly, Rabbi Yiṣḥaq ben Sha<sup>⊃</sup>ul — may his soul dwell in Paradise — relates the word <b>trembled before them</b> [Hebrew: <i>s̀<sup>ə</sup></i><sup>⊂</sup><i>arum</i>] to the word “to the satyrs” [Hebrew: <i>las̀s̀<sup>ə</sup></i><sup>⊂</sup><i>irim</i>] [Leviticus 17:<small>7</small>]. He also claims that the <i>lamed</i> (“to”) in the word <b>to demons</b> takes a delayed object in addition to its immediate object, rendering the verse “to demons, and <i>to</i> a non-power…”. In my opinion, however, none of this is necessary. The verse reads, “to demons, <i>who have</i> no power…”. They are called “demons” on account of the terror felt toward them, causing minds to become demented. <b>gods whom they did not know</b> How can they think that they are gods? They know it neither from their personal experience (thus, <b>they did not know),</b> nor from tradition (thus, <b>before whom your fathers did not tremble). new ones that arose of late</b> from recent, not from ancient, times — even <b>your fathers</b> did not know them. <b>trembled before them</b> From “shall come against him like a storm” [Daniel 11:<small>40</small>], and also “it made the hair of my flesh bristle up” [Job 4:<small>15</small>] — meaning, they did not fear them (although there is a pronomial suffix, the preposition <i>before</i> is implied; <i>cf.</i> “my children have gone out <i>from</i> me” [Jeremiah 10:<small>20</small>], and “you are stronger <i>than</i> I, and have prevailed” [Jeremiah 20:<small>7</small>]). The word is related to “tempest” [Hebrew: <i>s<sup>ə</sup></i><sup>⊂</sup><i>arah</i>] [Ezekiel 1:<small>4</small>] even though the latter word is spelled with a <i>samekh.</i>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn660"><b>[18] You have rejected the Rock Who bore you</b> The prophet speaks in wonderment: How could you have rejected the One Who bore you? The verse “look to the Rock from which you are hewn” [Isaiah 51:<small>1</small>] provides an additional interpretation of <b>the Rock Who bore you</b> — that you are, as it were, made <i>from</i> Him, since everything exists only by strength of G<small>OD</small> (compare, “that spreads abroad the earth by myself” [Isaiah 44:<small>24</small>]). The wonderment is against those errant of belief who have forgot this verse, as well as “this day have I begotten you” [Psalms 2:<small>7</small>]. <b>You have neglected</b> from “you shall not be forgotten” [Isaiah 44:<small>21</small>]. Here the letter following the <i>tav</i> is missing, with a <i>dagesh</i> taking the place of an absorbed <i>nun</i>, and also with a <i>yod</i> in place of a <i>heh</i> (as in “do not blot out” [Jeremiah 18:<small>23</small>] — both these words are accented on the penultimate, to distinguish the second person masculine singular future from the second person feminine singular future of an unaspirated <i>lamed-heh</i> verb) — although in my opinion the <i>yod</i> is simply extraneous, as the verb could have been conjugated as in “do not fail the words of my mouth” [Proverbs 4:<small>5</small>]. <b>Who established you</b> expresses the same idea as <b>Who bore you.</b> Both refer to a God who is mighty and firm, like a <b>rock.</b> The word <b>Who is established you</b> probably derives from the triliteral root ḥ-y-l. Compare, “a pregnant woman, about to give birth” [Isaiah 26:<small>17</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn661"><b>[19] detested</b> probably a transitive verb, as it is in the verse “and one detests the almond tree” [Ecclesiastes 12:<small>5</small>], although it could also be an intransitive verb. <b>His sons and daughters</b> The women as well as the men offered incense to idols.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn662"><b>[20] He said</b> to Himself, or to the angels. <b>I will hide</b> Scripture employs an anthropomorphism (as in “I will hide My eyes” [Isaiah 1:<small>15</small>]), to mean, When they beseech Me, they will find no succor. <b>I shall see what will be their end</b> Some have understood this passage to mean “I will hide My face, <i>because</i> I see what they will do in the end”, but in my opinion the verse means just what it seems to mean: “I will hide My face, until I see what they do when their troubles overtake them”. The antecedent of <b>for they are a contrary generation</b> is <b>I will hide My face. contrary</b> They have reversed themselves: they, who had been My children — for it is I Who bore them — have gone to worship other gods. There is thus no trustworthy among them (this word could be a noun<xref rid="fn693"><sup>1</sup></xref>, or it could be an adjective, meaning that there is no man among them who deserves trust).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn663"><b>[21] They have aroused My jealousy</b> For euphonic reasons, the second letter of the triliteral root lacks a <i>dagesh.</i> <b>with a non-power</b> i.e., something that lacks the ability to save. <b>with their vanities</b> and not with any true thing. <b>I will arouse jealousy against</b> a verb in the <i>hif‘il</i> form, taking both a direct and an indirect object. <b>with a non-people</b> that is, not <i>My</i> people. This is the elaboration of how <i>I will enrage them</i>: namely, that this nation will inflict its various troubles only on them, and <i>more</i> on them than on any other victim. <b>a barbarous nation</b> The imbecile and the barbarian lack knowledge, and thus kill without mercy.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn664"><b>[22] ignites</b> “Jealousy”, or “that which they do” is the implied subject of this verb, which we find used only transitively (e.g., “for you have kindled fire in My nostrils” [Jeremiah 17:<small>4</small>]). But it is also plausible that here the word means <i>is ignited</i> (as in “all these joined” [Genesis 14:<small>3</small>] — meaning, <i>were joined</i>). In any case, the image denotes anger. <b>burning to the lowest depths</b> Along the lines of “brimstone, and salt with burning fire on all its grounds” [29:<small>22</small>]. <b>devoured the land</b> i.e., the land of Israel. <b>set fire</b> from “flaming sword” [Genesis 3:<small>24</small>]. <b>mountains</b> i.e., the mountains of Israel.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn665"><b>[23] I will pile up</b> There are some who say that this word means “accumulate”, but actually it is more like the word <b>I will exhaust,</b> from “would you even destroy?” [Genesis 18:<small>23</small>], even though there the root appears in a different conjugation. The meaning is that not a single evil will remain that shall not befall them. The misfortunes are compared to arrows, which come upon one suddenly, and from which one cannot protect oneself.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn666"><b>[24] swollen of hunger</b> consumed by hunger, from “to heat the furnace” [Daniel 3:<small>19</small>]. <b>bread for the vultures</b> food for birds, as in “ethereal beings fly upward” [Job 5:<small>7</small>]. My understanding of this passage is that it recounts the four bearers of evil judgment, namely:
1) <b>swollen of hunger</b> i.e., famine
2) <b>bread for the vultures, lethal plagues</b> i.e., pestilence
3) <b>I shall send against them the teeth of beasts</b> i.e., wild animals, and
4) the sword (as in “without, the sword shall bereave” [<small>:25</small>])
The word <b>vultures</b> is related to “her coals are coals of fire” [Song of Songs 8:<small>6</small>], in the sense that the air became hot. <b>Lethal</b> means “destructive”. See also, “nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday” [Psalms 91:<small>6</small>], where it is used in the sense of “pestilence”. <b>plagues</b> Illness that is borne on the air, as in “the blackness of the day” [Job 3:<small>5</small>]. <b>Bread for vultures</b> means “food”, as in many similar instances [<i>comment on, e.g.,</i> Exodus 16:<small>4</small>]. <b>with the venom of the crawlers of dust</b> to be bitten thereby. The word <b>venom</b> is only used in an expression of biting. <b>crawlers of dust</b> refers to poisonous serpents. The word <b>crawl</b> also means “to cower” — for all who see them, cower in fear before them (compare “<sup>⊃</sup>Emim” [<i>comment on</i> Genesis 14:<small>5</small>]) — since participles frequently act as nouns. Similar usage can be found in the speech of Elihu the son of Barakh<sup>⊂</sup>el [Job 32:<small>6</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn667"><b>[25]</b> The phrase <b>both the youth</b> is the delayed object of <b>the sword shall bereave.</b> I have already explained the usage of the Hebrew word <b>both</b> [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 4:<small>10</small>]. The intent is to include everyone: “young men and maidens, the elderly with the young” [Psalms 148:<small>12</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn668"><b>[26]</b> There are those who say [<i>cf. Sifrey</i> on this verse] that <b>I would annihilate them</b> [Hebrew: <sup>⊃</sup><i>af</i><sup>⊃</sup><i>eyhem</i>] is three words spoken together, but the truth is that it is a word which lacks a cognate, and which means “to destroy”, since the following parallel construction says <b>I would obliterate their memory from mankind.</b> And if things were in accordance with the opinion of those grammarians [<i>cf.</i> Septuagint on this verse: ει̉πα Διασπερω αυ̉τούς — Translator] who translate “I shall scatter them to every comer [Hebrew: <i>pe</i><sup>⊃</sup><i>ah</i>]”, the parallelism would not adhere to the word’s meaning. Those who take the word to mean, “I shall destroy them in my anger [Hebrew: <sup>⊃</sup><i>appi</i>]” rendering the word correctly in the sense of “to extirpate”, and conjugating the verb like the word “I would obliterate them” — it is true that they get the parallelism right, and they would be correct, were it not for the second <i>’alef</i> in <sup>⊃</sup><i>af</i><sup>⊃</sup><i>eyhem</i>, which according to their theory ought to be a <i>nun</i>: <sup>⊃</sup><i>anpihem</i>, meaning, I shall be angry at them. Thus my original explanation is the correct one. <b>I said</b> an anthroporphism, i.e., “I said to Myself”.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn669"><b>[27] My concern</b> I was fearful, as in “Moab was terrified” [Numbers 22:<small>3</small>]. Scriptures employs an anthropomorphism, so as to be better understood by the reader. Although the Aramaic translator relates the word to “gathers at harvest-time” [Proverbs 6:<small>8</small>], the truth is that the word is derived from “attack” [<i>cf.</i> Psalms 39:<small>11</small>]. <b>deny</b> The opposite of “recognize, acknowledge” (as in “he acted as a stranger toward them” [Genesis 42:<small>7</small>]). <b>has wrought all this</b> against the tribes of Israel.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn670"><b>[28] For they are a nation lacking counsel</b> The enemies of Israel are the referred-to nation. The word <b>lacking,</b> a participle in the construct case (hence the <i>pattaḥ</i> under the <i>vet</i>), here serves as an adjective. It is well known that <b>lacking</b> is an intransitive verb; the word <b>counsel</b> simply explains that which they are lacking. Compare “withered of her leaves” [Isaiah 1:<small>30</small>]. See also “lost from the way” [Psalms 2:<small>12</small>], where the construct case is predicated on the word “way”. Accordingly, the translator who rendered “they have lost counsel”, translated wisely.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn671"><b>[29] were they wise</b> Either

If they were wise, they would realize that G<small>OD</small> has wrought all this against Israel on account of their sins

or

They would have understood what the end result would be — what G<small>OD</small> would do on account of their sins.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn672"><b>[30] How can one pursue</b> The sense of the passage is, If Israel were wise, they would realize: how can one of their enemies pursue a thousand Israelites, were it not because <b>their Rock</b> has abandoned them? Another interpretation is, How can Israel, which formerly pursued one against a thousand, now be defeated? <b>their Rock had renounced</b> [literally: sold] <b>them</b> Here used in the sense of “given them away”. Compare, “G<small>OD</small> will give Sis<sup>ə</sup>ra up” [Judges 4:<small>9</small>]. The choice of words suggests giving them away “in exchange for” their evil deeds — which is, in a sense, a kind of “selling”. <b>given them up</b> This word is to be understood either in the sense of “He shuts the door on a man” [Job 12:<small>14</small>], or, perhaps, in the sense of “our part is to give him over” [I Samuel 23:<small>20</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn673"><b>[31] For their rock is not like our Rock</b> These are the words of Moshe, elaborating on the above “they are a nation lacking counsel” [:<small>28</small>]: Our Rock has renounced us — not that they have a god like ours, nor that they are better warriors than we. Accordingly Moshe proceeds to state, “nor are <b>our enemies judges”</b> (the word <b>not</b> continues to modify the remainder of the verse, as in “I have not learned knowledge, [nor] understood holiness” [Proverbs 30:<small>3</small>]. However, there is another opinion that the latter clause is meant in the affirmative sense — our enemies <i>are</i> just (i.e., they acknowledge the truth, that our Rock has renounced us). Under this interpretation, the passage
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn674"><b>[32] from the vineyard of Sodom</b> does not refer to our enemies. <b>and from the fields</b> is a parallelistic construction, as is <b>bitter clusters.</b>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn675"><b>[33]</b> Although <b>hemlock</b> is here spelled with an ’<i>alef</i>, it is cognate with the same word spelled with a <i>vav</i> [:<small>32</small>]. <b>vipers</b> as in “on a viper’s pit” [Isaiah 11:<small>8</small>]. <b>cruel</b> implacable. The ’<i>alef</i> is extraneous, like the ’<i>alef</i> in “finger” and in “arm” [<i>cf.</i> Jeremiah 32:<small>21</small>; Job 31:<small>22</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn676"><b>[34] Is it not secreted with Me</b> These are the words of G<small>OD</small>. Some say that the implied antecedent is the evil decrees; but it seems more plausible to me that the antecedent is the “wine that is the hemlock of vipers” — it is reserved for them, to drink it. The word <b>secreted</b> is understood from context, because there are no words related to it. <b>sealed within My vaults</b> so that no one may touch it; but it is reserved for them,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn677"><b>[35]</b> to exact vengeance from them. <b>Vengeance is Mine, and recompense</b> This last word is a noun. Compare, “in not the incense …” [Jeremiah 44:<small>21</small>]. The meaning is: I shall have vengeance, and I shall have recompense, to pay them back for their deeds. <b>at the moment their feet shall waver</b> meaning, when they fall, and are unable to get up. <b>the moment</b> <i>cf.</i> “even the wicked for the day of evil” [Proverbs 16:<small>4</small>]. There is a profound mystery [i.e., Divine foreknowledge of human choices — Translator] concealed here. <b>near</b> Do not think that the vengeance will be against their descendants. <b>they shall feel</b> [<i>singular</i>] <b>their</b> [<i>plural</i>] <b>destiny</b> Each individual shall sense his own future<xref rid="fn694"><sup>1</sup></xref>, as in “branches [<i>plural</i>] that run [<i>singular</i>] over the wall” [Genesis 49:<small>22</small>]. The verb <b>feel</b> stems from a biliteral root. <b>destiny</b> The evils that are destined to befall them.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn678"><b>[36]</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>will execute justice for His people</b> He will take His people’s judgment away from them. Compare, “Judge me, God, champion my cause” [Psalms 43:<small>1</small>]. I have already explained the word <b>He will repent</b> [<i>comment on</i> Genesis 6:<small>6</small>]. <b>powerlessness</b> [literally: exhausted arm] that is, the powerless of Israel. <b>arm</b> here denotes “power”. The <i>tav</i> in <b>exhausted</b> [Hebrew: <sup>⊃</sup><i>azlat</i>] appears in place of a <i>heh</i>; both letters are used in Hebrew to indicate present tense feminine singular. Compare, “it reverts [Hebrew: <i>shavat</i>] to the prince” [Ezekiel 46:<small>17</small>]. <b>nothing either gathered or ungathered</b> When there are large numbers of captives, they normally take some, and leave the rest; but now, nearly all are gone.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn679"><b>[37] he will say</b> i.e., the enemy will say. <b>the Rock in Whom they trused</b> already explained [<i>comment on</i> :<small>4</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn680"><b>[38] ate</b> These are the words of Israel’s enemies, who believed that the burnt-offerings are the food of the gods. Note their use of the plural form of the verb. That is why Scripture replies, “I, I” [:<small>39</small>]: I alone — One — and no other God with Me. <b>wine-offering</b> [Hebrew: <i>nasikh</i>] as in “wine-offering” [Hebrew: <i>nesekh</i>] [Leviticus 23:<small>13</small>]. The same root has given rise to two different nouns. There are some who interpret the phrase to mean, “the wine of their king”, after “princes [Hebrew: <i>nsikhey</i>] of Midian” [“princes of Siḥon” [Joshua 13:<small>21</small>] must be meant — Translator], the etymology being that the king was the one who offered the sacrificial wine. But the former interpretation strikes me as more likely. <b>and help you</b> The suffices indicate a second person masculine plural direct object, masculine plural subject (as in “we bless you” [Psalms 118:<small>26</small>]). But if you assert that He is singular — then let Him come and provide you with refuge against the coming calamities.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn681"><b>[39] I, I</b> Either a mere stylistic repetition, as in “I, I” [Isaiah 51:<small>12</small>], or, more correctly, “I am I”, meaning, I am the same One — I have not changed. There is no other actor working with Him — I am the One Who has brought death to Israel, and I am also the One Who shall bring life to them. And just as <i>they</i> did not escape from Me, so, too, there will be none <b>to save</b> <i>you</i> <b>from My hand</b> — i.e., you, too, are in My hands, until I shall have done you justice. ¶ Many say [Pesaḥim 68a] that this is the verse from which we learn the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, since the verse <i>first</i> says <b>I slay,</b> and <i>then</i> says <b>I bring life</b> (as in “G<small>OD</small> kills and gives life” [I Samuel 2:<small>6</small>], as evidenced by the subsequent statement that G<small>OD</small> “lowers to the grave, and raises up” [I Samuel 2:<small>6</small>]). Others [<i>Breshit Rabba</i> on Genesis 9:<small>5</small>] have said that the doctrine is derived from the verse “Surely your blood of your souls” [Genesis 9:<small>5</small>] [because the prohibition of suicide that is derived from the verse would be meaningless without an afterlife — Translator], or from “It will be our privilege” [6:<small>25</small>] or [Qiddushin 40a] from “For He is your life” — in this world — “and your longevity” — in the World to Come [30:<small>20</small>], or [Qiddushin 39b] from “that it may be well with you” [5:<small>16</small>] [see also Sanhedrin 90b — Translator]. Hai Gaon, of blessed memory, has said that Scripture did not need to explain the doctrine of the World to Come, because it has been transmitted to us through tradition. My opinion is that the Torah was given to everyone, not to the lone individual, and that not one man in a thousand can comprehend the doctrine of the World to Come, on account of its profundity. To understand the reward of the World to Come requires an understanding of the nature of the soul. It comes about in return for one’s “service of the heart”, the service of which is to contemplate the works of G<small>OD</small>, for they are the ladder by means of which one ascends to the level of knowledge of G<small>OD</small>, the ultimate goal. Moreover, the Torah has provided, for the discerning, the illustration of the “Tree of Life” [<i>cf. comment on</i> Genesis 3:<small>24</small>], through which the Cherubim [Genesis 3:<small>24</small>] receive the power of immortality. Whoever eats of the Tree of Life will live forever, like the ministering angels [<i>cf.</i> Genesis 3:<small>22</small>]. Similarly, in the forty-ninth Psalm, there is the mysterious passage, “But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave, for He will take me” [Psalms 49:<small>16</small>], and also, “afterward, You will take me into honor” [Psalms 73:<small>24</small>]. Both passages employ the verb “to take”, just as is used to describe Ḥ<sup>ɐ</sup>nokh [Genesis 5:<small>24</small>] and Elijah [II Kings 2:<small>10</small>]. The discerning will understand how the Psalmist can say “their soul’s redemption is too costly” [Psalms 49:<small>9</small>] and then say later “He will redeem my soul” [Psalms 49:<small>16</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn682"><b>[40] For I raise My Hand to heaven</b> An oath is taken over something lasting. <b>raise</b> Compare, “He raised his right hand and his left hand to heaven” [Daniel 12:<small>7</small>]. The word is an anthropomorphism, to aid the reader’s understanding. <b>As I live</b> Just as I live, so shall I surely do this.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn683"><b>[41] I have sharpened</b> An <i>‘ayin-‘ayin</i> verb (like “I ingratiate myself to the children of my belly” [Job 19:<small>17</small>]), from “a sharp arrow” [Proverbs 25:<small>18</small>]. <b>My Hand shall grasp hold of justice</b> The sword is the warrior’s instrument of justice. <b>I shall return vengeance</b> meaning, Just as they have done to Israel, so shall I pay them back.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn684"><b>[42] from the blood of the slain</b> is a displaced specification of the phrase <b>I shall make drunk …</b>. The word <b>captives</b> refers to those who were wounded. <b>from the head</b> is a displaced specification of the phrase <b>shall consume flesh.</b> It denotes the cutting off of a head. <b>punishments</b> as in “when vengeance was taken” [Judges 5:<small>2</small>]. In Rabbinic Hebrew this root can be seen in the <i>nif‘al</i> form.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn685"><b>[43] O Nations, glorify His people!</b> They will glorify them, after G<small>OD</small> has exacted vengeance for their blood. Some people derive the word from “a cry went over” [I Kings 22:<small>36</small>], understanding the word in the sense of “a proclamation” — i.e., in all the places where they [Israel’s enemies — Translator] may be, they will announce proclamations over them. <b>and atone for His land, His people</b> Some say that this passage is missing a <i>vav</i>, and should be understood as if it read, “atone for His land, <i>and</i> for His people”. There is also a homiletical explanation [Palestinian Talmud Kil’ayyim 9:<small>4</small> (32d)] that the land atones for His people. Although this idea is correct, it does not fit into the context of the verse, and, moreover, “land” is a feminine noun (as definitively evidenced by the terminal <i>heh</i>, even though here a <i>tav</i> takes its place), whereas the verse does not employ “atone” in its feminine form. The correct explanation, in my opinion, is that the nation will atone for the land, reversing the order of the subject and the object of the verb, as we find in “water wears away stones” [Job 14:<small>19</small>]. There are other cases where “atonement” appears without the preposition “for” (e.g., “you shall purify it and make atonement [for] it” [Ezekiel 43:<small>20</small>]). The sense of the verse is that Israel shall exact vengeance against the nations, and thereby atone for the land of Israel, on account of the blood that had been spilled there (as in, “the land will not receive atonement” [Numbers 36:<small>33</small>]). <i>This</i> fits in with the context of the verse. Another explanation is that “atone” is used here in the sense of “purify”, as in “make atonement [for] it” [Ezekiel 43:<small>20</small>]; similarly Ezekiel says, concerning the final war, “they will cleanse the land” [Ezekiel 39:<small>16</small>], referring to Israel.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn686"><b>[44] Moshe came</b> To indicate that after Moshe went to every tribe and charged them [<i>comment on</i> 31:<small>1</small>], he then came to the Tent of Assembly, where all the children of Israel gathered before him, and where he then recited the song. <b>he and Hoshea the son of Nun</b> Compare, “Moshe, and the children of Israel, then sang” [Exodus 15:<small>1</small>] [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 15:<small>1</small>]. This was also done to exalt the stature of Y<sup>ə</sup>hoshua<sup>⊂</sup> in the eyes of the nation. Scripture calls him <b>Hoshea</b> because that was the name by which all Israel knew him, for who, other than the chieftans of the people, knew that Moshe had changed his name to Y<sup>ə</sup>hoshua<sup>⊂</sup>? There is also the well-known homiletical explanation [that he remained as pious as when he had been a commoner — Translator] [<i>Sifrey</i> on this verse].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn687"><b>[47] it is your life</b> as in “fear of G<small>OD</small> extends one’s days [Proverbs 10:<small>27</small>]. Also, that you will live in a goodly land, and not in exile.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn688"><b>[48] On that selfsame day</b> The day on which he recited the song.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn689"><b>[50] and die</b> i.e., to prepare oneself to die (for he was to bury himself, as I shall explain [<i>comment on</i> 34:<small>6</small>]). I have already alluded [<i>comment on</i> Genesis 25:<small>8</small>} to what one of the sages of our generation has said concerning the word <b>and was gathered.</b>
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn690"><b>[51] in that you failed to sanctify</b> as explained earlier [<i>comment on</i> Numbers 20:<small>8</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn691"><sup>1</sup>The specific mention of an <i>eagle’s</i> wings, however, is used in the same sense as it is in “I brought you to Me” [Exodus 19:<small>4</small>], referring to the <i>swiftness</i> of their arrival at Mount Sinai, having departed “triumphantly” [Exodus 14:<small>8</small>]. Compare “who are these that fly as a cloud” [Isaiah 60:<small>8</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn692"><sup>1</sup>We find similar usages in “the faithful fail” [Psalms 12:<small>2</small>] (paralleling the word “the godly man”), and in “keeper of the faithful” [Isaiah 26:<small>2</small>] [i.e., the word “faithful”, normally an adjective, is clearly used as a noun in those two verses — Translator].

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn696"><b>[2] came on Sinai</b> Sa‘adya Gaon, of blessed memory, said that <b>Sinai</b> and <b>Seir</b> and <b>Paran</b> are all close to one another, and that this verse refers to the Revelation at Sinai. Although the verse mentions Sinai with a <i>mem</i>, it is here used in the sense of “<i>upon</i> Sinai”, the same being the case with the word <b>Seir. from the holy myriads</b> This denotes the angels. The subject of the clause is the Divine Presence, which had descended. <b>a fiery law</b> i.e., the Torah, which had been given among fire and lightning. Sa‘adya Gaon said further that G<small>OD</small> <b>came on Sinai</b> is an invocation, as if to say: “O, You Who descended upon Sinai, and bequeathed the Torah, may Reuven live <i>etc.</i>”. But this is all farfetched, because in that case it would have to employ the second person masculine singular imperative, “grant life” and “do not kill”. Those who lack belief have said that <b>Seir</b> denotes the religion of Edom, while <b>Paran</b> denotes the religion of Ishmael. But these people are befuddled. Did they not see that he set out to bless Israel alone? — as it is written, “which Moshe, the man of God, bestowed upon the Children of Israel” [:<small>1</small>], and then continues with <b>shone to them from Seir</b><xref rid="fn733"><sup>1</sup></xref>. The correct interpretation, in my opinion, is that this section is a general benediction, covering all Israel, followed by the specific blessings for each individual tribe, after which he once again includes them all (in the passage, “Jeshurun, there is none like God” [:<small>26</small>]). We find elsewhere that Deborah said, “G<small>OD</small>, when you came forth from Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom” [Judges 5:<small>4</small>], where clearly “the field of Edom” does not denote a mountain, although Sa‘adya Gaon claims that our verse describes three mountains that adjoin one another, or that face one another. Also, from the book of Psalms: “God, when You went forth before Your nation, when You marched through the wilderness” [Psalms 68:<small>8</small>], following which we have “the earth shook” [Psalms 68:<small>9</small>]; and the abovementioned “march of the Divine Presence through the wilderness” did not occur on the day of the giving of the Torah, for they entered the desert upon leaving the wilderness of Paran. Moreover, Habakkuk said, “God came from <i>Teyman</i>” [Habakkuk 3:<small>3</small>] (the latter being one of the descendants of Edom — <i>see</i> “Teyman, Omer, …” [Genesis 36:<small>11</small>]) meaning the same as “from the field of Edom” [Judges 5:<small>4</small>]. These verses all speak about wars, as evidenced by “let G<small>OD</small> arise, let His enemies be scattered” [Psalms 68:<small>2</small>]. Scripture likens G<small>OD</small>’s rescuing of His servants to help “descending” from G<small>OD</small>, and to the earth trembling, and to mountains melting, and to the heavens clamoring. Further evidence can be found in the song of David: “the earth shook and trembled” [Psalms 18:<small>8</small>]. I have explained “Sinai itself” [Psalms 68:<small>9</small>] in its place [<i>comment on</i> Psalms 68:<small>9</small>], but I shall repeat myself here: “G<small>OD</small> came” — denotes the entry of the Glory among Israel. <b>Sinai</b> was the beginning of that entry. <b>shone from Seir</b> — during all the years that Israel was in the wilderness, G<small>OD</small> did not display His might among the nations, until Israel came to the field of Edom. From the verse “their Mount Seir, as far as El-Paran” [Genesis 14:<small>6</small>] we see that Seir was near <b>Paran.</b> Clearly, then, the meaning of our verse is: from the place of <b>Seir</b> (i.e., from the time that Israel arrived at Seir), at that point the Glory shone upon Israel. <b>appeared from Mount Paran</b> — this is a parallelism, repeating the idea that here was the point at which He displayed His splendor. <b>and came from the holy myriads</b> In my opinion, this phrase is governed by <b>at His right.</b> In other words: A fire came from <b>holy myriads,</b> from the right hand of G<small>OD</small>, to surround Israel (like the fiery horses and fiery chariot surrounding Elisha [II Kings 6:<small>17</small>]), and the word <b>law</b> means that it is constant, permanent.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn697"><b>[3] however loving</b> cognate to the Aramaic word which translates “you shall be My chosen treasure” [Exodus 19:<small>5</small>]. <b>peoples</b> denotes Israel. Compare, “After you, Benjamin with your peoples” [Judges 5:<small>14</small>], “They shall call nations to the mountain” [:<small>19</small>]. <b>All His holy ones</b> the children of Levi. <b>are in Your hand</b> for they surround the Ark. The word <b>in Your hand</b> means, You watch over them. <b>they follow at Your feet</b> they walk along Your path. <b>carrying forth at Your words</b> for they shall teach the Torah (referring to those who transmit the Oral Law). <b>carrying forth</b> [<i>singular</i>] each single individual (even though the word <b>they</b> is plural). <b>Your words</b> means that they shall carry all that You have spoken. It is they who carry the Torah, and it is also they who carry, literally, the Ark. <b>carrying</b> as in, “you shall not raise up groundless reports” [Exodus 23:<small>1</small>]. <b>follow</b> There is no other word related to this word. There are some who say that it comes from “from within”, as if to say, “they go forth from within Your feet”. Others say that the <i>tav</i> appears in place of a <i>heh</i> (like the <i>tav</i> in “I taught Efrayim to walk” [Hosea 11:<small>3</small>]), as if to say, Even though they be “beaten” on Your account, they shall not abandon Your words. But this is far-fetched. The correct interpretation of the word is similar to “they are drawn”, meaning, they will go to the place where the Ark is situated, which is “G<small>OD</small>’s footstool” [<i>cf.</i> Psalms 99:<small>5</small>]. ¶ This blessing, then, is that G<small>OD</small> will be a wall of flame surrounding Israel, and that His beloved, along with the Levites, will forever teach the Torah.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn698"><b>[4] The Torah that Moshe commanded us</b> This verse — describing how we received from Moshe the heritage that we possess — shall be handed over and recited from generation to generation [Sukka 42a]. The <i>lamed</i> in the word <b>for us</b> is a preposition with a compound object, applying also to <b>the congregation of Jacob.</b> The word <b>inheritance</b> is similarly duplicated in meaning (as in “and the prophecy, [being the prophecy] of ‘Oded the prophet” [II Chronicles 15:<small>8</small>]), as if the verse read, “The Torah that Moshe commanded for us as an inheritance, is an inheritance for the congregation of Jacob”.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn699"><b>[5] king</b> This denotes Moshe, from whose mouth the heads of the nation heard the Torah elucidated [the <i>halakha</i> [Rosh HaShana 32b] is that this verse may be used in the liturgy to refer to God’s majesty — Translator]. The intent of the verse is that Moshe was like a king, who gathered before him the chiefs of the tribes. This explanation is substantiated by the verses which state that the Torah was given to the <i>kohanim</i> [31:<small>9</small>] (who — in my opinion — are meant by “all His holy ones are in Your hand” [:<small>3</small>]), and then to all the elders of Israel [31:<small>9</small>] (they being meant by <b>when the chiefs of the people assembled</b>). In fact, in the above-cited passage, Scripture states, “Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes” [31:<small>28</small>]. However, Rabbi Y<sup>ə</sup>hudah HaLevy, of blessed memory, said that the <b>king</b> was allegorical of the Torah. He also gave a similar explanation to “There was no king in Israel” [Judges 18:<small>1</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn700"><b>[6] May Reuven live</b> He begins with the eldest, as is customary. He does not mention Shim<sup>⊂</sup>on, either

because of the incident of Baal Peor [Numbers 25:<small>3</small>], in which the worshipers were Shim<sup>⊂</sup>onites, as evidenced by their decline in numbers [Numbers 26:<small>14</small>] [<i>cf.</i> Numbers 1:<small>23</small>], as well as by the fact that it was their chieftain who was killed [Numbers 25:<small>14</small>].

or

He follows Ya<sup>⊂</sup>aqov’s example, who did not bless Shim<sup>⊂</sup>on or Levi. Out of respect for Aaron, his tribe was excepted, borne up on the coattails of Aaron; but Shim<sup>⊂</sup>on lacked a great man of equivalent stature. If one should object, and ask, Why, then, did Moshe bless Reuven? — the answer is that Ya<sup>⊂</sup>aqov <i>did</i> bless Reuven, the blessing being “you shall not stand out” [Genesis 49:<small>4</small>], i.e., that he should be as one of his brethren.

After Reuven, he mentions Y<sup>ə</sup>hudah, who was the standard-bearer, and the first to go into battle. Then Levi, and then Benjamin, on account of the Levites’ dwelling in Jerusalem, which lay between the territory of Y<sup>ə</sup>hudah and the territory of Benjamin, as it is written [<i>cf.</i> Joshua 18:<small>28</small>, Judges 1:<small>8</small>]. Then the tribe of Joseph, in order not to postpone them, having already given precedence to his younger brother. Then Zevulun, on account of his going into war [Judges 5:<small>18</small>], and then Yissakhar. After completing the children of the major wives, he begins with Gad, who encamped under the standard of two children of the major wives, and then Dan, since he was a standard-bearer, and then Naftali, because he was greater than Asher. ¶ The phrase <b>May Reuven live</b> is a supplication. <b>and not die</b> for it is possible that the tribe could survive a finite number of years, like a man, and then die. <b>and his men be numbered</b> i.e., and his men <i>not</i> be numbered, as in “I have not learned knowledge, [nor] understood holiness” [Proverbs 30:<small>3</small>] (see also the particle “as” in “as Almighty God” [Exodus 6:<small>3</small>] [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 6:<small>3</small>]), as I have explained in numerous places — for it is possible for the tribe to survive indefinitely, and still remain few in number. Anything that can be numbered is scanty (compare, “my men are numbered” [Genesis 34:<small>30</small>]).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn701"><b>[7] This for Y<sup>ə</sup>hudah</b> The same was said for Y<sup>ə</sup>hudah — that he should live, and not die. Then he proceeded to add <b>Hear, O</b> G<small>OD</small>, <b>the voice of Y<sup>ə</sup>hudah</b> (when embarking in battle — since Y<sup>ə</sup>hudah marched at the head of the army) <b>and bring him to his people</b> (this either refers to the headquarters at Gilgal [Joshua 10:<small>43</small>], or it is a prayer for those who go off to do battle in enemy territory). <b>his hands shall satisfy</b> [Hebrew: <i>rav</i>] <b>him</b> i.e., his own hands shall suffice him: He shall not be in need of help from anyone, save that of G<small>OD</small> alone. But there are some who derive the word from “strife” [Hebrew: <i>m<sup>ə</sup>rivah</i>], meaning that his hands will strive for him. Others relate the word to “He shot out [Hebrew: <i>rav</i>] lightnings” [Psalms 18:<small>15</small>], along the lines of “shot at him [Hebrew: <i>robbu</i>]” [Genesis 49:<small>23</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn702"><b>[8] Of Levi</b> [literally: to Levi] <b>he said</b> He said to G<small>OD</small>, <i>concerning</i> Levi. Compare, “Say concerning me, ‘He is my brother’” [Genesis 20:<small>13</small>]. <b>for Your pious one</b> the man who is pious for You. <b>whom You tested at Massah</b> this last word here has the sense of a common noun, meaning “a test”. The verse thus is rendered as follows: He is a pious one, in whom there has been found no fault, except for the matter of Merivah, over which he has already been punished. This also strengthens my explanation concerning the matter of the golden calf, that he made it for the glory of G<small>OD</small> [<i>comment on</i> Exodus 31:<small>18</small>]. <b>Your <i>Tumim</i> and Your <i>Urim</i></b> will forever be his, and his descendants’.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn703"><b>[9] Who says …</b> [<i>singular</i>] “The tribe” is the subject of the verb.

However, there are some who say [Yoma 66b] that this verse refers to the “whoever is for G<small>OD</small>, join me” episode [Exodus 32:<small>26</small>].

Consequently, great numbers of them will come to the mountain of G<small>OD</small>, to offer thanksgiving sacrifices to G<small>OD</small>.

Compare, “the ceiling beams” [I Kings 6:<small>15</small>]. The meaning is that he beheld veneered palaces, which had been the possession of the Amorite chieftains. The word <b>he came</b> is missing an <i>’alef.</i> The meaning of the passage is that the leaders of Gad came over with the rest of Israel in battle formation, and Moshe foresaw this prophetically. <b>he performed</b> G<small>OD</small><b>’s righteousness</b> i.e., he fulfilled in deed the thing of which he had spoken in word — namely, the children of Gad swore that they would go out in battle with Israel against their enemies [Numbers 32:<small>27</small>]. Moshe does not mention Reuven in this context, perhaps because the tribe of Gad were more valorous than the tribe of Reuven (as is suggested by the passage in Chronicles, which says of Gad, “their faces were like the face of a lion” [I Chronicles 12:<small>9</small>], without any similar statement about Reuven).
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn716"><b>[22]</b> The word <b>springing</b> has no cognate in Scripture. The sense of the passage is that Dan is compared, in his strength, to a wild lion, as he leaps from the hills of Bashan.

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn719"><b>[25] Your doorbolts are iron and brass</b> because there will be hills of iron and brass in his territory. <b>as your days is your strength</b> The latter word has no cognate, although the meaning of the Aramaic translation [“may your old age be like your youth”] is well known (that you will have vigor all your life). There are some who say that the ’<i>alef</i> in this word [Hebrew: <i>dov</i><sup>⊃</sup><i>ekha</i>] takes the place of the duplicated letter in an <i>‘ayin-‘ayin</i> root (as it does in “whose land the rivers have despoiled” [Isaiah 18:<small>2</small>]), thus relating the word to “causing the sleepers’ lips to murmur [Hebrew: <i>dovev</i>]” [Song of Songs 7:<small>10</small>]. But this idea is nonsense.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn720"><b>[26] O Jeshurun, there is none like God</b> Moshe returns to an all-inclusive blessing [<i>cf. comment on</i> :<small>2</small>].

</ftnote><ftnote id="fn721"><b>[27] the ancient God is a shelter</b> The word <b>shelter</b> means “booth” (as evidenced by “in Shalem is His booth, and His shelter in Zion” [Psalms 76:<small>3</small>], and many similar passages). In other words: Your shelter is the ancient God. Compare, “you have made the Most High your shelter” [Psalms 91:<small>9</small>] and “You have been a shelter for us” [Psalms 90:<small>1</small>]. A shelter is always above that which is sheltered by it; the sheltered area is always beneath. <b>with His arms beneath</b> to support you. The sense of <b>eternal</b> is: Since they are forever, they will not weary. Similarly, your shelter will never pass away. because it is <b>the ancient God</b> (meaning, “primal”, with absolutely nothing antecedent to Him, nor anything that will succeed Him — for the concepts of “predecessor” and “successor” apply only to material things). Sa‘adya Gaon understood <b>beneath</b> to mean “below G<small>OD</small>”, but this explanation is vacuous.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn722"><b>[28] the fountain of Jacob</b> all those who issued forth from the stream of Jacob. Compare, “who came forth from the waters of Y<sup>ə</sup>hudah” [Isaiah 48:<small>1</small>]. The phrase <b>toward a land</b> is here meant in the sense of “<i>in</i> the land”. Similarly, “pray in this place” [literally: toward this place] [I Kings 8:<small>35</small>]. <b>even his</b> [<i>masculine</i>] <b>heavens</b> The antecedent could either be <b>land</b> (here taking the masculine gender), or it could be Israel. In either case, the sense is: Just as it is the way of the land to bring forth grain and wine, so, too, the heavens faithfully yield their dew, and there is no need for irrigation.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn723"><b>[29] who is like you</b> among the nations. <b>the shield of your aid</b> so that no evil will touch you. <b>of Whom the sword</b> i.e., Who is Himself the sword through which you will triumph over all your enemies, as in Gideon’s slogan [<i>cf.</i> Judges 7:<small>20</small>]. <b>you shall tread</b> as in “footstep” [2:<small>5</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn724"><b>[34:<small>1</small>]</b> It is my belief that Joshua wrote from this verse onward, because once Moshe ascended, he wrote nothing further. Joshua must have written prophetically, as evidenced by G<small>OD</small> <b>showed…,</b> as well as
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn725"><b>[4]</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>said to him…,</b> and “He buried…” [:<small>6</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn726"><b>[5] There died Moshe, the servant of</b> G<small>OD</small> Even in his death, he acted as a servant, performing that which he was commanded. <b>by the word of</b> G<small>OD</small> For He had said to him, “Ascend…and die” [32:<small>49–50</small>]. It is likewise written concerning Aaron: “by the word of G<small>OD</small>” [Numbers 33:<small>38</small>], and similarly, “by the word of G<small>OD</small> they encamped” [Numbers 9:<small>23</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn727"><b>[6] He buried him</b> He buried <i>himself</i> (by going into a crypt within the Gai). Compare, “the shepherds tended themselves [literally: the shepherds tended them]” [Ezekiel 34:<small>8</small>] and “the officers of the Children of Israel saw them” [Exodus 5:<small>19</small>]. Mount <sup>⊂</sup>Avarim (also known as Mount Nebo, named for a star) is the same place as the <b>Gai</b> which is at the top of the cliff across from Beth-P<sup>ə⊂</sup>or. This is attested to by Scripture, which states that Israel traveled from Bamoth to “the Gai which is in the field of Moab, by the top of a cliff” [Numbers 21:<small>20</small>]; Scripture also states that “Moshe ascended from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of the cliff” [:<small>1</small>], where he died and was buried. Elsewhere Scripture says, “we stayed in the Gai, across Beth-P<sup>ə⊂</sup>or” [3:<small>29</small>]; and subsequent to their encampment in the Gai, Scripture says that “the Children of Israel marched on and encamped at the plains of Moab” [Numbers 22:<small>1</small>] [<i>see also</i> 3:<small>29</small>]. But in another place, Scripture says, “they encamped in the hills of <sup>⊂</sup>Avarim, in front of Nebo; then they marched <i>from the hills of</i> <sup>⊂</sup><i>Avarim</i>, and encamped in the plains of Moab” [Numbers 33:<small>47–48</small>]. And it is clear that the place where Moshe died would be the place where he was buried. <b>to this day</b> These are Joshua’s words [Bava Batra 15a], who wrote them, most likely, toward the end of his life.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn728"><b>[7]</b> The <i>heh</i> in <b>his moisture</b> replaces a <i>vav</i>; compare “his tent” [Genesis 9:<small>21</small>]. The word comes from “fresh” [Genesis 30:<small>37</small>]. Most elderly men are defeated by the forces of dessication. <b>abate</b> is the opposite of “to become taut”.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn729"><b>[8] the sons of Israel</b> But when Aaron died, the whole “House of Israel” mourned [Numbers 20:<small>29</small>], out of respect for Moshe. <b>came to an end</b> i.e., <i>when</i> <b>the days of weeping in Moshe’s mourning</b> came to an end there,
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn730"><b>[9]</b> <i>then</i> the Children of Israel hearkened to Joshua. <b>full of the spirit of wisdom</b> i.e., the spirit of G<small>OD</small>. This is borne out by <b>for Moshe had laid his hands upon him</b> (because nowhere else in Israel was one found upon whom he could rely). <b>and did as</b> G<small>OD</small> <b>had commanded Moshe</b> namely, they hearkened to Joshua.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn731"><b>[10]</b> I have already explained the term <b>face to face</b> [<i>comment on</i> 5:<small>4</small>].
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn732"><b>[12] powerful might</b> the wonders of the Red Sea. <b>great and awesome acts</b> the revelation at Sinai.
</ftnote><ftnote id="fn733"><sup>1</sup>The Hebrew word <i>lamo</i> means “to them”, as in “no obstacle exists for them [Hebrew: <i>lamo</i>]” [Psalms 119:<small>165</small>].
