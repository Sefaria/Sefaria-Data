        "One whose dead lies before him, he is exempt from reciting the Shema, from saying the Amidah and from wearing tefillin.  The pall bearers, their replacements and the replacements of the replacements, regardless of whether they are waking in the front or in the back of the stretcher are exempt. As for those that are not needed to carry the stretcher, they are obliged to recite the Shema.  These and those are the ones exempt from saying the Amidah.", 
        "He who buries the dead and comes back, If he can start and finish before returning to the line, he starts, If not, he does not start.  As for those standing in a row, The internal ones, they are exempt. The external ones, they are obligated.", 
        "Women, non-Jewish slaves and minors – are exempt from reciting the Shema and from tefillin, But they are obligated to recite the Amidah, to affix a mezuzah and to recite Birkat Hamazon.", 
        "The baal keri should think about the Shema in his heart and should not in his heart recite the blessings, not before and not after. And about food: the blessing after, and not the blessing before. Rabbi Yehudah says: He blesses before and after the Shema and food.", 
        "If one stands in prayer and remembers that he is a baal keri, He does not stop praying, but abridges the prayer.  If he went down to immerse in a mikvah, If he is able to come up, cover himself and do it before he sees the sun blossom – He comes up, covers himself and recites the Shema. But if he is not able to do so – He covers himself in waters and recites. But he does not cover himself, Not in foul waters. Nor in water in which flax soaked. Until he puts more water into it. And how far from filth must he be? Four cubits.(forearm)", 
        "A zav who saw a seminal emission, a niddah who discharged semen from prior sexual relations. and a woman having sexual relations who saw her menses, require immersion in a mikvah; but Rabbi Yehudah exempts them."
