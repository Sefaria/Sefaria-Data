        "Rabbi Yehuda says, 'Rabbi Ishmael asked Rabbi Yehoshua, when they were walking along the road, he said to him: \"Due to what is gentile cheese prohibited?\" He (Rabbi Yehoshua) said to him: \"Because they curdle it with rennet from carrion.\" He (Rabbi Ishmael) said to him \"But is not the (law of) rennet of a whole offering more stringent (literal: serious, drastic) than the rennet of carrion? As it is said ________________________ *Please someone put here what ﻿כהן שדעתו יפה שורפה חייב ולא מועלין means!* (Rabbi Yehoshua) He gave as the reason: \"Because they curdle it (the cheese) with rennet from calves that were used for idol worship.\" And he (Rabbi Ishmael) said: \"If so, why is there no prohibition to benefit from it?\" They redirected (the conversation) to another topic. (Rabbi Yehoshua) He said to him: \"Ishmael, my brother, how do you read (Shir HaShirim 1): \"For your love (Hebrew: Masculine: Dodecha) is better than wine\", or \"For your love (Hebrew: feminine: Dodayich) is better than wine\"?

For its comrade (The following verse) teaches upon it. \"For your oils (Hebrew: Masculine: Shmanecha) have a good fragrance.\"",
