        "These are the things that have no measure: The Peah of the field, the first-fruits, the appearance [at the Temple in Jerusalem on Pilgrimage Festivals], acts of kindness, and the study of the Torah.  These are things the fruits of which a man enjoys in this world, while the principle remains for him in the World to Come: Honoring father and mother, acts of kindness, and bringing peace between a man and his fellow. But the study of Torah is equal to them all.", 
        "One should not make the Peah less than one-sixtieth of the entire crop, And though there no definite amount is given for Peah. It is all based upon the size of the field, the number of poor who will be collecting it, and the abundance of the crop.", 
        "Leave the Peah from the beginning [of the harvest] of the field or in the middle [of the harvest]. Rabbi Shimon says: Only give out of the final measure. Rabbi Yehudah says: If he has left even one stalk, he must give Peah. And if otherwise, he is giving away his crop to the public.", 
        "In general, they say about the corner, all that is food, guard and grow from the ground, and collect it as one crop and bring it in to observe the obligation of Peah. And the grain and the legumes are in this general rule.", 
        "And as for the trees: The sumac, the carob, the nuts, the almond, the grapevines, the pomegranate, the olive, and the dates are obligated in Peah.", 
        "Continually, he may give of Peah and is exempt from the tithes until he spreads it, and gives it out as abandoned, it is exempt from tithes until he spreads it, and feed it to animals and to the beast and to the birds, and it is exempt from tithes until he spreads it.  One may take from the granary and sow seed and it is exempt from tithes until he spreads it, these are the words of Râ€™ Akiva. If a priest and a Levite took a granary, the tithes are theirs until it is spread. Dedicated and redeemed produce are obligated in tithes until the treasurer spreads it."
