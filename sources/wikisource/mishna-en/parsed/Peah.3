        "For quadrangular frames of grain that are between olive trees, The school of Shammai says, “A corner from each and every one.” The school of Hillel says, “Give one from all of it.” And they acknowledge that if the main rows are mixed together, One gives a corner from one over all of them.", 
        "If one cuts his field and leaves over living stalks, R’ Akiva says, “Give a corner for each one.” And the Sages say, “Give one corner for them all.” And the Sages acknowledge R’ Akiva that, For one who sows dill or mustard in three places, He gives a corner from each and every one.", 
        "One that separates onions to take the ripe ones to the market, While maintaining the dry ones in the granary, He gives a corner for each respective one. And thus it is for beans, and thus it is for a vineyard. One who thins out the field gives from the remainder that is left over, And one who separates from one particular area gives of the remnant for the whole.", 
        "The mother seeds of onions are obligated in the law of the corner, And R’ Yosi exempts this. For the quadrangular beds of onions that are between other vegetables, R’ Yosi says, “The corner must be taken from each and every one.” And the Sages say, “From one covers all of them.”", 
        "When brothers divide what was given to them, they give two corners. If they revisit their partnership, they give one corner. Two that take some trees, give one corner. If this one takes the north, and that one takes the south, This one gives a corner for him, and that one gives a corner for him. If one sells a tree in his field, he must give a corner for each and every one. R’ Yehuda said, “When is this? In a time when nothing is left over for the field owner, But if something is left over for the field owner, He gives a corner for the whole.”", 
        "R’ Eliezer says, “One fourth the ground is obligated to give a corner.” R’ Yehoshua says, “If he made two Seah.” R’ Tarfon says, “Six by six handbreadths”. R’ Yehuda ben B’saira says, “In order to harvest and repeat.” And the law is as he spoke. R’ Akiva says, “All the ground is obligated to give a corner, And the first fruits, And a Prozbul may be written for it, And they can buy property with it that has no warranty With money, credit, or acquisition.", 
        "If a dying man writes of his property, if he has ground left over, his gift is a gift. If he has no ground left over, his gift is not a gift. If he writes his property to his children, and writes to his wife anything of the ground that he has, She has lost her marriage contract. R’ Yosi says, “If she receives it, even though it wasn’t written to her, She loses her marriage contract.”", 
        "If one writes property to his slave, he goes out a freeman. If any of his ground remains, he does not go out as a freeman. R’ Shimon says, “He always is a freeman unless he says: ‘Indeed, all my property is given to so-and-so, my slave, outside of one multitude of them.’”"
