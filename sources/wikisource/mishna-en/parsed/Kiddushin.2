A man has his daughter betrothed, when she is a young woman, by himself and through an agent.  One who says to a woman, \"Be betrothed to me with this date, be betrothed to me with this one\" — if there is in one of them [at least] a perutah's worth, she is betrothed, and if not, she is not betrothed. [If he says,] \"with this one, and with this one, and with this one\" — if there is in all of them [combined] [at least] a perutah's worth, she is betrothed, and if not, she is not betrothed. If she was eating them one by one [as he gave them to her], she is not betrothed unless there is in one of them [at least] a perutah's worth.", 
        "[One who says to a woman,] \"Be betrothed to me...\"  \"...with this cup of wine,\" and it was found to be honey; \"...of honey,\" and it was found to be wine;  \"...with this dinar of silver,\" and it was found to be gold; \"...of gold,\" and it was found to be silver;  \"...on condition that I am a pauper,\" and he was found to be a rich man; \"...a rich man,\" and he was found to be a pauper\" —  she is not betrothed.  Rabbi Shimon says: If he deceived her to [her] advantage, [she] is betrothed.", 
        "[One who says to a woman, \"Be betrothed to me...\"] \"...on condition that I am a priest,\" and he was found to be a Levite; \"...a Levite,\" and he was found to be a priest;  \"...a Nathinite,\" and he was found to be a mamzer; \"...a mamzer,\" and he was found to be a Nathinite;  \"...a village-dweller,\" and he was found to be a city-dweller; \"...a city-dweller,\" and he was found to be a village-dweller;  \"...on condition that my house is near to the bathhouse,\" and it was found to be far; \"...far [from the bathhouse],\" and it was found to be near;  \"...on condition that I have a senior daughter or maidservant,\" and he does not have; \"...on condition that I do not have [a senior daughter or maidservant],\" and he has;  \"...on condition that I do not have sons,\" and he has; \"...on condition that I do have [sons],\" and he does not have —  All of them, even though she says, \"It was in my heart to be betrothed to him even so,\" she is not betrothed.  And similarly if it was she that deceived him.", 
        "One who says to his agent, \"Go and betroth to me a certain woman in a certain place,\" and he went and betrothed her in another place — she is not betrothed.  [If he only said,] \"She is in a certain place,\" and he went and betrothed her in another place — she is betrothed.", 
        "One who betroths a woman on condition that she has no vows upon her, and there were found to be vows upon her — she is not betrothed. if he brought her in without conditions, and there were found to be vows upon her — she leaves without a ketuba.  [One who betroths a woman] on condition that she has no blemishes, and she was found to have blemishes — she is not betrothed. If he brought her in without conditions, and she was found to have blemishes — she leaves without a ketuba; For all blemishes that invalidate priests invalidate women [in marriage].", 
        "One who betroths two women with the equivalent value of a perutah, or a single woman with less than the equivalent value of a perutah — even though he sent betrothal gifts after this, she is not betrothed; for it was on account of the original betrothal that he sent [them]. And similarly a minor who betrothed.", 
        "One who betroths a woman and her daughter or a woman and her sister simultaneously — they are not betrothed.  [There was] an incident with five women, among them two sisters, and one [man] gathered a basket of dates; it belonged to them, and it was in the sabbatical year; he said to them, \"All of you are betrothed to me with this basket,\" and one of them accepted it on behalf of all of them. The sages said: The sisters are not betrothed.", 
        "[A priest] who betroths with his portion of the holiest of the holy [sacrifices], or of the minor holy [sacrifices] — she is not betrothed.
