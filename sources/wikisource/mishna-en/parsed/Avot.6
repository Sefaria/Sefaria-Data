        "Rabbi Meir says: Anyone who involves himself in Torah for its own sake merits many things, and moreover the entire world is worthwhile for his sake;  He is called \"friend,\" \"beloved,\" \"lover of the Ominpresent,\" \"lover of [all] creatures,\" \"delighter of the Ominpresent,\" \"delighter of [all] creatures;\"  He is clothed in humility and reverence, and it prepares him to be righteous, devout, upright and trustworthy, and it distances him from sin, and draws him near to merit;  We enjoy from him counsel and comprehension, understanding and strength, as it is said (Proverbs 8:14): \"Mine is counsel and comprehension, I am understanding, mine is strength;\"  It gives him kingship and dominion, and [the ability to] investigate in judgement, and the secrets of the Torah are revealed to him, and he becomes like an ever-strengthening spring, and like a river that does not stop;  He is modest and long-tempered, and forgives insult to him;  And it enlarges him and raises him above all [that God] made.", 
        "Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:  Each and every day a heavenly echo goes out from Mount Horeb, and announces and says: \"Woe to the creatures for disparaging the Torah;\"  for anyone who does not involve himself in the Torah is called \"rebuked,\" as it is said (Proverbs 11:22): \"A ring of gold in a swine's snout is a beautiful woman who turns from discretion,\" and it says (Exodus 32:16): \"And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tablets,\" do not read \"graven\" (harut) but rather \"freedom\" (herut), for there is no free man except one that involves himself in Torah learning;  And anyone who involves himself in Torah learning is elevated, as it is said (Numbers 21:19): \"and from Mattanah, Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel, Bamoth.\"",

        "Five possessions has the Holy One, Blessed be He, declared His own in His world, And they are: The Torah [is] one possession, Heaven and earth [are] one possession, Abraham [is] one possession, Israel [is] one possession, [And] the Sanctuary [is] one possession.  From where [do we infer that] the Torah [is] one possession? For it is written: “The Lord possessed me at the beginning of His way, the first of His of old.” (Proverbs 8:22.)  From where [do we infer that] heaven and earth [are] one possession? For it is written: “Thus says the Lord: ‘The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool. Which house might you build for Me? And which place might be My resting-place?’” (Isaiah 66:1), And it [also] says: “How manifold are Your works, O Lord! In wisdom have You made them all; full is the earth, Your possession.” (Psalm 104:24.)  From where [do we infer that] Abraham [is] one possession? For it is written: “And [Melchizedek] blessed him, and said: ‘Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth.’” (Genesis 14:19.)  From where [do we infer that] Israel [is] one possession? For it is written: “Till Your people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over whom You have made Your own” (Exodus 15:16), And it [also] says: “As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all My delight.” (Psalm 16:3.)  From where [do we infer that] the Sanctuary [is] one possession? For it is written: “The Sanctuary, O Lord, that Your hands have established” (Exodus 15:17), And it is [also] said: “And He brought them to His holy border, to the mountain, which His right hand had possessed.” (Psalm 78:54.)", 
        "All that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created in His world, He created only for His Glory, As it is said: “Everything that is called by My Name, and which I have created for My Glory, I have formed it, yea, I have made it” (Isaiah 43:7); And it [also] says: “The Lord shall reign forever and ever.” (Exodus 15:18.)"
