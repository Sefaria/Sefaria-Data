        "For every olive tree that there is in the field, Even if the olives drip on in its season, and he forgets, This is not forgotten. On what did they say this? On that which is known for its produce and is in a known place. “On that which is known” – a known rich olive tree or dry olive tree, or if it produces a great amount. “And is in a known place” – If it stands near a wine press or near a fence. And for the rest of all the olive trees, if one forgets two, they are forgotten, But if three, they are not forgotten. R’ Yosi said, “Olives cannot be forgotten.”", 
        "An olive tree that was found standing between three rows of two rectangles, If he forgets it, it is not forgotten. An olive tree that has two Seah on it, and he forgets it, it is not forgotten. On what did they say this? When it was not the season to start picking, but if the picking begun, Even if the olives drip like in its season, and he forgets it, this is forgotten. All times that there exists produce under it, this is for the owner. R’ Meir says, “This is only when the produce searcher has given up.”", 
        "What is a single grape? One that fell in the season of the grape harvest. If one was harvesting grapes, and he was cutting clusters of grapes that were entangled in leaves, And they fell from his hand to the earth, and they were made into single grapes, Indeed, this belongs to the master of the house. If one leaves a basket under the vine, in the season that he harvests grapes, Indeed, he is openly stealing from the poor. On this it is said, “Do not withdraw your eternal boarders.” (Proverbs 22:28)", 
        "What are grape gleanings? All that isn’t a shoulder (a single bunch on a single twig) And not a drop (a grape on the stalk). If there is a shoulder or a drop, it belongs to the master of the house. If there is a doubt, it belongs to the poor. If grape gleanings that are on the knee (the joint between branches or the stem and the trunk) are harvested with the cluster, Indeed, it belongs to the master of the house. And if not, indeed, they belong to the poor. For a single piece, R’ Yehuda says, “It is a cluster.” And the Sages say, “It is a grape gleaning.”", 
        "One who prunes the vines may prune his as he prunes the ones for the poor. These are the words of R’ Yehuda. R’ Meir says, “He has permission for his, but does not have permission for those of the poor.”", 
        "For a vineyard in its fourth (year, Leviticus 19:23-25), The school of Shammai says, “There is no fifth on it, and there is no sabbatical removal.\" And the school of Hillel says, “It has them.” The school of Shammai says, “It is obligated in single grapes and in grape gleanings, and the poor redeem for themselves.” And the school of Hillel says, “It is all for the wine press.”", 
        "If a vineyard consists entirely of grape gleanings, R’ Eliezer says, “It is for the master of the house.” R’ Akiva says, “It is for the poor.” R’ Eliezer said, “’Because you harvest, you don’t glean.’ (Deuteronomy 24:21) If you don’t harvest, where do the gleanings come from?” R’ Akiva said to him, “And your vineyard is not gleaned by you (Leviticus 19:10), Even if it is entirely gleanings. If so, why does it say ‘because you harvest you don’t glean’? This is for the poor who glean before the harvest.”", 
        "For one dedicates his vineyard, if it was not known to him that there were gleanings, they are gleanings for the poor. If it was known to him that there were gleanings, they are gleanings of the poor. R’ Yosi says, “He gives a payment of their worth to the Temple treasury.” What is forgotten on a trellis? Anything that he was unable to take by stretching out his arm. If on runners, when he advanced away from there."
