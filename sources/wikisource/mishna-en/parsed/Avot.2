        "Rabbi [Yehuda haNasi] said: Which is the right path that a person should choose for himself? Whichever [path] that is [itself] an honor to the person adopting [it], And [on account of which] honor [accrues] to him from [other] people.  And be as careful with a light commandment as with a weighty one, For you do not know the reward given [for the fulfillment] of [the respective] commandments. Also, weigh the loss [that may be sustained through the fulfillment] of a commandment against the reward [that may be obtained] for [fulfilling] it, And [weigh] the gain [that may be obtained through the committing] of a transgression against the loss [that may be sustained] by [committing] it.  Keep your eye on three things, and you will not come into the grip of sin: Know what is above you: An Eye that sees, And an Ear that hears, And all your deeds are written in a book.", 
        "Rabban Gamliel the son of Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi said: Excellent is the study of the Torah together with a worldly occupation, For the exertion [expended] in both of them causes sin to be forgotten. And all [study of the] Torah in the absence of a worldly occupation comes to nothing in the end and leads to sin.  And all who work for the community, let them work for the [sake of the] name of Heaven, For the merit of the [community’s] ancestors sustains them, And their [ancestors’] righteousness will endure forever. And as for you [who work for the community], [God says:] I credit you with a great reward, as if you [yourselves] had [actually] done [everything on your own].", 
        "Be careful about the authorities who approach a man only when they need him. They seem like good friends in good times, but they don't stay for him in time of his trouble.",
