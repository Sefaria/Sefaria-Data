        "The school of Shammai says, “Abandoning property to the poor, this is abandonment.” And the school of Hillel says, “He cannot abandon until he also does it for the rich, like the Sabbatical year.” If all sheaves of the field are of one Kav, And one sheaf is four Kav and it was forgotten, The school of Shammai says, “He has not forgotten it.” And the school of Hillel says, “He has forgotten it.”", 
        "The sheaf that was leaned against a stone wall, Or against the stack, or against the cattle, or against vessels, And was forgotten, The school of Shammai says, “He did not forget it.” The school of Hillel says, “He did forget.”", 
        "At head of the row, the sheaf that touches it confirms it. If one took the sheaf, and brought it to town, and forgot it there, It is acknowledged that it is not forgotten.", 
        "And these are the heads of rows: If two started from the middle of the row, this one facing north, and this one facing south, And they forgot some sheaves after them, the ones that were before them are forgotten, And the ones that were behind them are not forgotten. If one starts from the head of the row and he forgets after himself, Those before him are not forgotten and those after him are forgotten, And he cannot return for them. This is the general rule, All that he cannot return for, these are forgotten, And those he can return for, he has not forgotten.", 
        "Two sheaves are forgotten, and three are not forgotten, And two piles of olives or carobs are forgotten, and three are not forgotten, And two flax-stalks are forgotten, and three are not forgotten, And two single grapes are gleanings, and three are not gleanings, And two ears of grain are gleanings and three are not gleanings, These are the words of the school of Hillel. And on all this the school of Shammai said, “Three are for the poor and four are for the master of the house.”", 
        "If a sheaf is two Seah (one Seah is 8.29 to 14.4 L) and he forgets it, it is not forgotten. \"If two sheaves are two Seah, Rabban Gamliel says, “It is for the master of the house.” And the Sages say, “It is for the poor.” Rabban Gamliel said, “Is that so? A majority of the good sheaves are secured for the master of the house And you weaken what was secured for him.” They said to him, “His part is secured for him.” He said to them, “And since, in his time, he had one sheaf, and it was two Seah, And he forgot it, yet it is not forgotten, Then if he had two sheaves and they were two Seah, is it not the law that he did not forget?” They said to him, “No, if you say that one sheaf was like a stack, \"Will you come to say that two sheaves are like small bundles?”", 
        "If standing stalks that were two Seah were forgotten, They are not forgotten. If there were not two Seah, but it is fit for two Seah, Even if it is an inferior bean, it is like a good crop of barley.", 
        "The standing crop saves a sheaf and the standing crop. The sheaf does not save the sheaf or a standing crop. Which standing crop saves a sheaf? Anything that is not forgotten, Even a single stalk.", 
        "A Seah of uprooted grain and a Seah of grain that is not uprooted, And thus for trees, garlic, and onions are not joined to make two Seah, Rather, they are for the poor. R’ Yosi says, “If the poor man comes with authorization (i.e. for the corner), There is no joining, And if not, indeed, these are joined.”", 
        "Grain that is given for hay or for a sheaf And thus is for a bundle of garlic or bundles of garlic and onion, These cannot be forgotten. And anything that is concealed in the land, Like Serpentina and garlic and onions. R’ Yehuda says, “They cannot be forgotten.” And the Sages say, “They can be forgotten.”", 
        "If one harvests at night and he makes sheaves, and also for a blind person, they can forget. And if one intended to take the coarse ones, the coarse ones cannot be forgotten. If he said, “Indeed, I am harvesting so that I can take what I forget,” Now it may be forgotten."
