        "Shacharit can be said until Midday, Rabbi Yehudah says until four hours into the day.  Mincha can be said until the evening. Rabbi Yehudah says until the middle of the afternoon.  Ma'ariv has no set time.  Musaf can be said all day. Rabbi Yehudah says only until seven hours into the day.", 
        "Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakkana would offer a brief prayer when he entered the study hall and when he left. [His disciples/students] asked him: \"What is the purpose of this prayer?\" He told them: \"Upon my entrance, I pray that nothing harmful should happen because of me [incorrectly rendering halachic decisions]; and upon my departure, I offer thanksgiving for my portion.\"", 
        "Rabban Gamliel says: Every day a person must pray eighteen [blessings of the Amidah]. Rabbi Yehoshua says: [One may say] an abbreviated [form of the] eighteen [blessings]. Rabbi Akiva says: If the prayer is fluent in his mouth, he must say eighteen [blessings]; but if it is not -- [he may say] an abbreviated eighteen [because otherwise he may stumble on the words].", 
        "Rabbi Eliezer says: One who makes his prayer \"set\" [as though it is burdensome to him], his prayer does not constitute \"pleading\" [for divine mercy, and therefore he will not receive it]. Rabbi Yehoshua says: One who is traveling a dangerous place should offer a brief prayer, and say:  Save, Hashem, Your people, The remnant of Israel; Even when they distance themselves through sin, let their needs be before You. You are the Source of all blessing, Hashem, Who heeds prayer.", 
        "If one was riding a donkey, he should dismount from it [while he prays]. If he is unable to dismount, he should turn his face [towards Jerusalem]. And if he is unable to turn his face, he should focus his heart toward the Holy of Holies [in the Temple in Jerusalem].", 
        "If one was sitting in a boat, or in a wagon, or on a raft, [When he prays] he should focus his heart toward the Holy of Holies.", 
        "Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah says: [One] does not say the Additional Prayer except in the presence of a minyan. But the sages say: [One should always pray the Additional Service,] with a minyan or without a minyan. Rabbi Yehuda says in [Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah's] name: Any [town] in which there is a minyan praying, an individual [who is not with the minyan] is exempt from the Additional Prayer."
