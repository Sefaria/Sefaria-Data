        "How does one recite blessings for fruits?  For fruits growing on a tree, one says, \"...Who created the fruit of the tree,\" Except for wine; For wine, one says, \"...Who created the fruit of the vine.\"  For fruits growing from the earth, one says, \"...Who created the fruit of the ground,\" Except for bread; For bread, one says, \"...Who brings forth bread from the earth.\"  For vegetables, one says, \"...Who created the fruit of the ground.\" Rabbi Yehudah says: One should say instead, \"...Who created various types of herbs.\"", 
        "If one blessed for the fruits of the trees with \"...Who created the fruit from the fruit of the ground\" - He is finished. But if he blessed for the fruits of the ground \"...Who created the fruit of the trees\" - He is not finished.  But for all, if he said: \"For everything exists by God's word\" - He is finished.", 
        "For things which do not grow from the earth, say: \"For everything\". For vinegar, and for unripe fruits and for the locusts, say: \"For everything\". For milk, and for cheese and for eggs, say: \"For everything\".  Rabbi Yehudah says: All which is cursed – There is no blessing for.", 
        "If one has before him many different things: Rabbi Yehudah says: If there is among them one of the seven species – Bless for that one. But the Sages say: Bless for whichever he desires.", 
        "[If one] blessed for the wine before the meal – [he has] exempted the wine after the meal. [If one] blessed for the appetizer before the meal – [he has] exempted for the dessert after the meal. [If one] blessed for the bread – [he has] exempted the appetizer; [But if one blessed for] the appetizer – [he has] not exempted the bread. The House of Shammai says: Not even what was done in a pot.", 
        "If [people] sit – All bless for themselves. [But if they] recline – One blessing for all. [If] wine comes in during the meal – All bless for themselves. For after the meal – One blessing for all. And he who says for perfume Even though perfume is not brought until after the meal.", 
        "They brought before him salty food first, and bread with it -- He blesses on the salty food, and is exempt on the bread, because the bread is ancillary to it.  This is the principle: Everything that is primary, and the secondary is with it, The blessing of the primary exempts the secondary.", 
        "One who ate figs, grapes, or pomegranates, blesses three blessings after them -- words of Rabban Gamliel. The Sages say, One blessing, with the essence of three. Rabbi Akiva says, even one who ate vegetables, if that was his food, blesses three blessings after it.Drinking water for thirst, bless “That everything exists by His word.” Rabbi Tarphon says, \"Who creates many lives.\""
