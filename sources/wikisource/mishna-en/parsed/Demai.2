        "And these are the things to be tithed as uncertain produce in every place: The pressed figs, and the dates, and the carob, the rice, and the cumin. For the rice that grows outside of the land [of Israel], any use is exempt.", 
        "One who takes it on himself to be trustworthy must tithe that which he eats, And that which he sells, and that which he buys, and he may not stay as a guest for ignorant people. R’ Yehuda says, “Even if he is a guest of ignorant people, he is trustworthy.” They said to him, “On his own self, he is not trustworthy, how can he be reliable with that which belongs to another?”", 
        "One who takes it on himself to be a friend, May not sell to an ignorant person wet or dry [produce], and not buy from him wet [produce], And not be the guest of an ignorant person and not take him as a guest in his garments. R’ Yehuda says, “He may not even raise small animals, and not be quick to take on vows and entertainment, And not be defiled with the dead, and use the house of study.” They said to him, “These do not come from the general principle.”", 
        "The bakers are not obligated by the sages to separate except in order to tithe the first tithe and dough. The shopkeepers are not permitted to sell uncertain produce. All that handle rough measurements are permitted to sell uncertain produce. These are they which are handled in rough quantities, like the wholesalers and the sellers of grains.", 
        "R’ Meir says, “That for which it is the way to roughly measure, Yet it is measured in small amounts, It is of secondary importance to the rough amounts, And that for which it is the way to measure small, but was measured roughly, The rough amount is of secondary importance to the small. Which is a rough measurement? Three dry Kabin, and on wet, a Dinar [in weight].” R’ Yosi says, “Baskets of figs and baskets of grapes and a heap of greens, Every time they are sold by approximation, they are exempt.”"
