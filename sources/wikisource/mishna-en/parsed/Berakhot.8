        "These things are [disputed] between the school of Shammai and the school of Hillel about meals: The school of Shammai says, \"Bless the day, and afterward bless the wine.\" The school of Hillel says, \"Bless the wine, and afterward bless the day.\"", 
        "The school of Shammai says, \"Rinse the hands, and afterward pour the cup.\" The school of Hillel says, \"Pour the cup, and afterward rinse the hands.\"", 
        "The school of Shammai says, \"One wipes his hands in a napkin, and place it on the table.\" The school of Hillel says, \"On the cushion.\"", 
        "The school of Shammai says, \"We sweep the room, and afterward rinse the hands.\" The school of Hillel says, \"We rinse the hands, and afterward sweep the room.\"", 
        "The school of Shammai says, \"Flame, and grace after meals, and spices, and havdalah.\" The school of Hillel says, \"Flame, and spices, and Grace after meals, and havdalah.\" The school of Shammai says, \"Who created the light of fire.\" The school of Hillel says, \"Who created the lights of fire.\"", 
        "We do not bless: Neither over the flame nor over the spices of idolaters. Neither over the flame nor over the spices of the dead. Neither over the flame nor over the spices in front of an idol. We do not bless over the flame until its light is usable.", 
        "One who ate, and forgot, and did not bless: The school of Shammai says, he returns to his place and blesses. The school of Hillel says, he blesses in the place where he remembered. Until when may he bless? Until the food in his bowels is digested.", 
        "If wine is brought to them after the meal, and nothing is [available] there except for that cup: The school of Shammai says, \"Bless the wine, and afterward bless the meal.\" The school of Hillel says, \"Bless the meal and afterward bless the wine.\"  Respond \"Amen\" after a Jew blesses, and there is no response of amen after a Samaritan blesses until one has heard the whole blessing."
