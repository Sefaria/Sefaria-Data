        "All images are prohibited, for the reason that each one is worshiped once in the year. Said Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say not all images are prohibited but only the ones who have a stick (staff) in its hand, or a bird, or an orb. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says anything that has anything in its hand (is prohibited).", 
        "If one finds a broken image (fragments), see, it is permitted. If one finds the form of a hand or the form of a foot, see, these are prohibited. Because it is derived from transgression (has been worshiped).", 
        "If one finds a vessel and on it a drawing of the sun or a drawing of the moon, or a drawing of a dragon, he should cast them into the Salt Sea. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says; if they are treated with honor, they are forbidden, if they are treated disparagingly, they are permitted. Rabbi Yose says; One should grind it (the vessel) to powder and disperse it among the wind, or hurl it into the sea. The Sages said; Even though it might become manure? As it is said: \"And let nothing of the ban cling to your hand\" (Devarim/Deuteronomy 13:18).",
