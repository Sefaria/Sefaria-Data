        "A stack of grain from which everything underneath it that touched the ground was not collected, Indeed, this is for the poor. If wind scatters the sheaves, He sees how much there was to collect and gives to the poor appropriately. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, “Give to the poor the amount that (normally) falls.”", 
        "If, during harvesting, a grain’s ear touches the standing crop, If it can be harvested with the standing crop, Indeed, it belongs to the master of the house. And if not, indeed, it belongs to the poor. If a grain’s ear is intermixed in the stack, It must be tithed and one shall be given to the poor. R’ Eliezer said, “And how does this poor person exchange this thing that did not come to be permitted to him? Rather, grant him the entire stack and tithe one ear to be given to him.\"", 
        "There may be no irrigating wheel; These are the words of R’ Meir. And the Sages say, “It is permitted from that which is possible.”", 
        "If the master of the house was passing from one place to another place, And if he needs to take the gleanings, the forgotten sheaves, The corner, and the tithes of the poor, he may take, And when he returns to his house, he pays for them; These are the words of R’ Eliezer. And the Sages say, “He was poor in his time (of need).”", 
        "If he exchanges with the poor, on his, he is exempt, and on the poor person's item, he is obligated. If two received a field to farm together, this one gives a tithe of his portion to the poor, And that one gives a tithe of his portion to the poor. If the receiver of the field harvests it, The gleanings, the forgotten sheaves, and the poor tithe are forbidden to him. R’ Yehuda said, “When? In the time that he receives from it a half, a third, or a fourth. But if he said to him, you may harvest a third for yourself, He is permitted to the gleanings, the forgotten sheaves, and the corner, And forbidden to the tithe of the poor.”", 
        "If he sells his field, the seller is permitted, and the buyer is not. He may not hire a man to work on his portion to have his son collect after him. One who does not allow the poor to glean, or he allows one, and not another, or he helps one, Indeed, he openly steals from the poor, as it is said, “Do not withdraw the eternal boarder.” (Proverbs 22:28)", 
        "If the sheaves are forgotten by workers, And the master of the house did not forget it, Or the master of the house forgot and the workers did not forget it, Or if the poor stood before him, or if the straw was covered, Indeed, this is not forgotten.", 
        "One who covers sheaves for a temporary pile, these cannot be forgotten, But if they are taken from there to the granary, they can be forgotten. If the sheaves are in a stack, they can be forgotten. If these are taken to the granary, they cannot be forgotten. This is the general rule: Anytime the sheaves are in a place that work is completed with them, They can be forgotten, But if they are taken to the granary, they cannot be forgotten. If it is a place where the work is not completed, they cannot be forgotten, If they are taken to the granary, they can be forgotten."
