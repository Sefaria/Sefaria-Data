        "Ben Zoma says:    Who is the wise one? He who learns from all men, as it says, \"I have acquired understanding from all my teachers\" (Psalms 119:99).    Who is the mighty one? He who conquers his desire, as it says, \"slowness to anger is better than a mighty person.\" (Proverbs 16:32).    Who is the rich one? He who is happy with his lot, as it says, \"When you eat [from] the work of your hands, you will be happy, and it will be well with you\" (Psalms 128:2). \"You will be happy\" in this world, and \"it will be well with you\" in the world to come.    Who is honored? He who honors the created beings, as it says, \"For, those who honor Me, I will honor; and those who despise me will be held in little esteem\" (I Samuel 2:30).", 
        "Ben Azzai says: Run to do an easy mitzvah, and flee from sin; since one mitzvah leads to another mitzvah, and one sin leads to another sin; since the reward for a mitzvah is another mitzvah, and the reward for one sin is another sin.", 
        "[Ben Azai] would say: Do not disparage anyone, and do not shun any thing. For you have no man who does not have [his] hour, and you have no thing which does not have a place.",
