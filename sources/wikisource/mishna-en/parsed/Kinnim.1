        "The blood service of a fowl sin-offering is done below the Altar's midline, and the blood service of an animal sin-offering is done above.  A fowl elevation-offering is done above, and an animal elevation-offering [is done] below.  If the kohen altered the service of either one, he has invalidated it.", 
        "This is the scheme for [offering] bird-pairs: The [bird-pair offering which is] obligatory – one is a sin-offering, and one is an elevation-offering. For [birds which are] vowed sacrifices and donations – they are all elevation-offerings.  Which is a vowed sacrifice? One who says, \"I am hereby obligated to bring an elevation-offering.\" Which is a donation? One who says, \"This [animal] is hereby an elevation-offering.\"  What is the [practical] difference between vowed sacrifices and donations? Only that [if] vowed sacrifices died or were stolen, [the owner] is liable to pay for a replacement; [whereas if] donations died or were stolen, [the owner] is not liable to pay for a replacement.", 
        "[In the case of] a sin-offering which became mixed in with elevation-offering[s], or an elevation-offering [which became mixed in] with sin-offering[s], even one in ten thousand – they must all be put to death.  [In the case of] a sin-offering which became mixed in with obligatory [pairs], only the number of sin-offerings among the obligatory [pairs] are permitted [to be sacrificed].  Similarly, [in the the case of] an elevation-offering which became mixed in with obligatory [pairs], only the number of elevation-offerings among the obligatory [pairs] are permitted [to be sacrificed].  [The above is true] whether the obligatory [pairs] are many and the donated [elevation-]offering[s] are few, whether the donated [elevation-]offering[s] are many and the obligatory [pairs] are few, [or] whether they are both equal.", 
        "In what [case] were the [rules in the previous mishnah] stated? When obligatory [bird-pairs] and donated [elevation-]offerings [became mixed].  But [in the case of] obligatory [bird-pairs] which became mixed with each other:  [If] one [person] had one [pair] and the other had one [pair], [or] one had two and the other had two, [or] one had three and the other had three[, etc.]; half are permitted [to be sacrificed] and half are invalid.  [If] one [person] had one [pair], another had two, another had three and another had one hundred, [only] the smaller number are permitted [to be sacrificed].  [The above is true] whether [they are all] from one designation or whether [they are] from two designations, [and] whether [they are all] from one woman or whether [they are] from two women.", 
        "How is it [considered] from one designation? [A bird-pair brought for] a birth and [another brought for] a birth, [or for] a vaginal discharge and a vaginal discharge – [this is considered] from one designation. From two designations? [A bird-pair brought for] a birth and [another brought for] a vaginal discharge.  How [are the cases when the sacrifices are] from two women? [A bird-pair brought for] a birth for one [woman], and [one brought for] a birth for the other [woman], [or for] a vaginal discharge for one [woman] and a vaginal discharge for the other [woman] – [this is considered] from one designation. From two designations? [A bird-pair brought for] a birth for one [woman] and [one brought for] a vaginal discharge for the other [woman].  Rabbi Yosi says: Two women who purchased their bird-pairs as a mixed group, or that gave the money for their bird-pairs to the kohen; For whichever the kohen pleases, he may offer a sin-offering, and for whichever he pleases, he may offer an elevation-offering – whether [they are all] from one designation or whether [they are] from two designations."
