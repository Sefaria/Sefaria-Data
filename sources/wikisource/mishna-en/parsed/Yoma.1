        "Seven days before the Day of Atonement, we sequester the High Priest from his house to the Palhedrin Chamber, and we prepare for him another priest in his place, [for] perhaps there will occur in him a disqualification.  Rabbi Yehuda says: We even prepare another wife for him, [for] perhaps his wife will die; as it is said, \"and he shall atone for himself and for his household\" - his \"household\" is his wife. The Sages said: If so, there is no end to the matter.", 
        "All seven days [of his sequestration], [the High Priest] casts the blood, and burns the incense, and cleans the lamps, and offers the head and the leg [of the continual-offering]. All other days, if he wants to offer, he offers â€” for the High Priest offers a portion first, and takes a portion first.",
