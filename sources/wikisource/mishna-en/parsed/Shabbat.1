        "The [fobidden] transfers [of domain] on Shabbat are two, which are [really] four, [from] inside, and two, which are [really] four, [from] outside.  How is this?  [Assuming] a poor person stands outside, and the owner of the building [stands] inside:  [If] the poor person reached his hand inside, and put [something] into the hand of the owner of the building; or took [something] from it and brought it outside; the poor person is liable, and the owner of the building is exempt.  [If] the owner of the building reached his hand outside, and put [something] into the hand of the poor person; or took [something] from it and brought it inside; the owner of the building is liable, and the poor person is exempt.  [If] the poor person reached his hand inside, and the owner of the building took [something] from it; or put [something] into it, and [the poor person] brought it outside; they are both exempt.  [If] the owner of the building reached his hand outside, and the poor person took [something] from it; or put [something] into it, and [the owner of the building] brought it inside; they are both exempt.", 
        "A man may not sit before the barber close to [the time of] mincha, And may not enter either a bath-house, a tannery, [or enter] to eat, or for judgment [in court].' But if [people] began, they do not [need to] interrupt. We interrupt for the recitation of Shema, but we do not interrupt for prayers.", 
        "The tailor may not go out with his needle close to nightfall, [for] perhaps he will forget and go out [on Shabbat]; and neither [may] the scribe [go out] with his quill.  One may not delouse his apparel, and may not read by lamp-light.  In truth, the lector may see where the youngsters are reading, but he may not read.  Similarly, A man who experienced a flow may not eat with a woman who experienced a flow, because of habitual sin.", 
        "And these are some of the regulations enacted in the attic of Hananiah b. Hyzkiyah b. Gorion, when the rabbis came to visit him. They called the roll and found that the disciples of Shamai were more numerous than those of Hillel, and they enforced eighteen regulations on that day.", 
        "The Beth Shamai said: Ink, dye material, or fodder (for animals) shall not be put into water (on Friday) unless there is still time for them to soak through while it is day. The Beth Hillel, however, permits this.", 
        "Bet Shammai says, One may not put bundles of flax into the oven, unless they will be steamed during the day; nor wool into the kettle, unless it will absorb the appearance. But Bet Hillel permits it. Bet Shammai says, One may not spread nets for animals, birds or fish, unless they ensnare during the day; Bet Hillel permits.",
