        "Moshe received the Torah [and these teachings on ethics and character are also] from [God's revelation at] Sinai, And he transmitted it to Yehoshua, And Yehoshua to the Elders And the Elders to the Prophets And the Prophets transmitted it to the Men of the Great Assembly.  They said these three things [in particular, because the duration of the Torah rests on them]: Deliberate before delivering a verdict [even if such a case has come before you two or three times], and establish many students [without inspecting or rejecting anyone unless he is known to be of ill repute], and make a fence for the Torah [to prevent coming to touch prohibitions therein].", 
        "Shimon the Tzadik was of the last of the Great Assembly. He has said, On three things the world stands– On the Torah, and on the Avodah, and on Deeds of Lovingkindess.", 
        "Antignos of Sokho received from Shimon the Tzadik. He would say, Don't be as slaves serving the master, in order to receive a reward, Rather be as servants serving the master unconditionally, not in order to receive a reward; And may the fear of the Heavens be upon you.", 
        "Yosei ben Yoezer of Tzreida and Yosef ben Yochanan of Yerushalayim received from him.  Yosei ben Yoezer of Tzreida says, Make your house a meeting house for the sages; and get sooty in the dust of their feet, and drink with thirst their words.", 
        "Yosei ben Yochanan of Yerushalayim says, Make your house open wide, and make the poor as children of your house. And do not increase conversation with the woman. With his wife, they said, all the more so with the wife of his friend;  From here the sages said, All the time a man increases conversation with the woman-- He causes badness to himself, and neglects the words of Torah, And in his end he inherits Gehenna.", 
        "Yehoshua ben Perachiah and Nittai of Arbel received the transmission from them.  Yehoshua ben Perachia said, Make for yourself a rabbi, acquire for yourself a friend; and judge every person in their favor.", 
        "Nittai of Arbel said, Distance yourself from a bad neighbor, Do not befriend a wicked person, And do not despair of punishment.", 
        "Yehudah ben Tabbai and Shimon ben Shatach received from them.  Yehudah ben Tabbai said, Do not act as an advisor among judges. When the litigants are before you, see them as criminals. And when the litigants have taken their leave, see them as innocent, should they have accepted the decision.", 
        "Shimon ben Shatach said: Examine the witnesses thoroughly, but be careful in your diction, lest from your words they lie.", 
        "Shemayah and Avtalyon recieved the tradition from them.  Shemayah said: Love work, And hate power, And do not get friendly with the government", 
        "Avtaloyon said: Sages, be careful with your words, unless you are exiled to a place of evil water [heretic teachings; see note]. The following students might drink and profane the name of the Heavens.", 
        "Hillel and Shammai received [the Torah] from them [Shemayah and Avtalyon].  Hillel used to say: Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving [one's fellow] creatures and bringing them closer to the Torah.", 
        "He [also] used to say: A name made widespread [eventually] loses its fame. And one who does not increase [his knowledge] causes [it] to decrease. And one who does not study [the Torah] is liable to die. And one who makes [unworthy] use of the crown [of learning] passes away.", 
        "This was another favorite teaching of his: If I am not for me, who will be for me? If I am only for myself, what am I? If not now, when?", 
        "Shammai used to say: Make your Torah [study a] fixed [habit]. Speak little, and do much. And receive every person with a pleasant countenance.", 
        "Rabban Gamliel used to say: Provide for yourself a teacher. And remove yourself from doubt. And do not make a habit of tithing by guesswork.", 
        "Shimon, his son, used to say: All my days, I grew up among the Sages, And I found nothing better for a person than silence. And studying [the Torah] is not the most important thing, but doing [it is]. And whoever talks too much brings about sin.", 
        "Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel used to say: On three things does the world stand: On justice, and on truth, and on peace, As it is said: “Judge with truth, justice, and peace in your gates.”"
