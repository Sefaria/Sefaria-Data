        "These are those which we are lenient with separating the uncertain produce: Wild figs, the fruit of the lotus, crab apples, white figs, fruit of the sycamore, ruined dates, grapes, and capers; And in Judea, the sumac, vinegar, and coriander. R’ Yehuda says, “All the wild figs are exempt, except for those that bear twice a year; And all the lotus fruits except for the lotus fruit from the sycamore field; And all the sycamore fruits are exempt except for fruit that has burst open.”", 
        "Uncertain produce does not have a fifth, And there is no removal for it, and mourners don’t eat it, And they enter into Jerusalem and go out from there, And one may lose a small amount of it on the road, And it may be given to an ignoramus, and he may eat something else instead and exchange it, Silver for silver, copper for copper, silver for copper, and copper for fruit. And only may he return to redeem the fruits, this is the opinion of R’ Meir. And the sages say, “He brings up the fruit, and he eats it in Jerusalem.”", 
        "One who buys seed for domestic animals, flour for skins, oil for lighting, and oil for utensil grease; These are exempt from separating the uncertain produce, From K’ziv and beyond are exempt from separating the uncertain produce. The Challah of an ignoramus, and that which is mixed, And that which was bought with money of the second tithe and the remnant of the meal offering, Are exempt from separating the uncertain produce. Pleasant oil is obligated by the school of Shammai, and the school of Hillel exempts.", 
        "The separation of uncertain produce may be used to make Eruv boundaries and partnerships, And to bless the meal, and tithes may be separated while naked before nightfall. If one separated the second tithe before the first, this doesn’t matter. Oil with which a weaver anoints his fingers is obligated to be separated when uncertain, And that which the comber gives in wool is exempt from the separation."
