        "Akavia ben Mahalalel said: Keep in mind three things, And you will not come into the hands of sin:  Know: From where you came, And to where you are going, And before Whom you will have to give an account and a reckoning.  From where did you come? From a putrid drop.  And to where are you going? To a place of dust, worms, and maggots.  And before Whom will you have to give an account and a reckoning? Before the King of kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He.", 
        "Rabbi Chanina, the Deputy High Priest, said: Pray for the welfare of the government, For were it not for the fear of it, One person would eat the other alive.  Rabbi Chanania ben Tradyon said: [When] two sit together and there are no words of Torah [spoken] between them, This is a session of scorners, As it is said (in Psalm 1:1): “[Happy is the man who has] not . . . sat in the seat of the scornful.”  But [when] two sit together and there are words of Torah [spoken] between them, The Divine Presence rests with them, As it is said (in Malachi 3:16): “Then they who feared the Lord spoke one with another, and the Lord hearkened and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for them who feared the Lord and who thought upon His Name.”  [The Mishnah asks:] I have no [Scriptural support for the proposition that the Divine Presence rests with them] except [with] two. From where [is there proof that] even [when there is only] one [person studying Torah], The Holy One, Blessed be He, determines a reward for him? As it is said (in Lamentations 3:28): “Though he sits alone and [meditates] in silence, yet he takes [a reward] to himself.”",

        "Rabbi Chalafta [ben Dosa] of Kfar Chananiah said: [When] ten sit together and occupy themselves with Torah, The Divine Presence rests among them, As it is said (in Psalm 82:1): “God stands in the congregation of God.”  And from where [can one learn that the Divine Presence rests] even [among] five? As it is said (in Amos 9:6): “And He has founded His band upon the earth.”  And from where [can one learn that the Divine Presence rests] even [among] three? As it is said (in Psalm 82:1): “In the midst of the judges He judges.”  And from where [can one learn that the Divine Presence rests] even [with] two? As it is said (in Malachi 3:16): “Then they who feared the Lord spoke one with another, And the Lord hearkened, and heard.”  And from where [can one learn that the Divine Presence rests] even [with] one? As it is said (in Exodus 20:20 (20:21 in NJPS)): “In every place where I cause My Name to be mentioned I will come to you and bless you.”",
