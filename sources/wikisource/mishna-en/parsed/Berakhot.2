        "If one was reading [the Shema] in the Torah, and it came time to recite [the Shema]: If he directed his heart [and intended to fulfill his obligation to recite the Shema as he read it], he has fulfilled his obligation. And if not, he has not fulfilled his obligation. At the breaks [between sections of the Shema], one may greet another out of honor and return a greeting, And in the middle [of a section], one may greet out of fear and return a greeting. These are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: In the middle, one may greet out of fear and return a greeting out of honor, And at the breaks, one may greet out of honor and return a greeting to any person.", 
        "These are the section breaks: Between the first and second blessings, Between the second blessing and Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4), Between Shema and V'hayah im shamoa (\"If you truly listen\")(Deuteronomy 11:13), Between V'hayah im shamoa and Vayomer (\"[God] said\")(Numbers 15:37), Between Vayomer and Emet v'yatziv (\"True and enduring\"). Rabbi Yehuda says: Between Vayomer and Emet v'yatziv -- one may not pause. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah said: Why does Shema precede V'hayah im shamoa? So that one may accept the yoke of the kingdom of heaven first, And after that accept the yoke of the commandments. And [why does] V'hayah im shamoa [precede] Vayomer? Because V'hayah im shamoa applies during the day and at night, And Vayomer only applies during the day.", 
        "One who recites Shema but doesn't make it audible to his ear - has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Yosei says: Has not fulfilled his obligation. One who recites but does not articulate each letter: Rabbi Yosei says: Has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Yehuda says: Has not fulfilled his obligation. One who recites out of order - has not fulfilled his obligation. One who recites and makes a mistake - should return to the place where he made the mistake.", 
        "Workers can recite [Shema] on top of a tree or on top of a wall of stones, which they are not permitted to do for tefillah [prayer].", 
        "A groom is exempt from reciting Shema on the first night, until Saturday night if he has not done the deed. A story about Rabban Gamliel who recited [Shema] on the first night that he got married. His students said to him: Didn't you teach us, our teacher, that a groom is exempt from reciting Shema on the first night? He said to them: I will not listen to you, to remove the kingdom of heaven from me for even one hour.", 
        "[Rabban Gamliel] washed on the first night after his wife died. His students said to him: Didn't you teach us, our teacher, that a mourner is forbidden to wash? He said to them: I am not like other people. I am delicate.", 
        "And when [Rabban Gamliel's] slave Tavi died, He received words of comfort for him. His students said to him: Didn't you teach us, our teacher, that one does not receive words of comfort for slaves? He said to them: My servant Tavi was not like other servants. He was kasher.", 
        "If a groom wants to recite Shema on the first night, he may recite [it]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not everyone who wants to take on the name may take it on."
