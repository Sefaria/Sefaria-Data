Nevertheless there shall be a medicine for the sons of the woman, but for thee, serpent, there shall be no medicine: but it is to be that for these there shall be a remedy for the heel in the days of the king Meshiha.
Gen 3:16

Gen 3:18  And thorns and dardareen shall it increase to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb which is on the face of the field. Adam answered and said, I pray, through mercies from before Thee, O Lord, that we are not accounted before Thee as the cattle, to eat the herb which is on the face of the field. Let us now stand up, and labor with the labor of the hands, and eat food of the fruits of the earth; and in these things let there be distinction before Thee between the children of men and the cattle.

It is to be that a great people are to arise from him; from him will arise a people who will know how to discern between good and evil. And now it is good that we keep him from the garden of Eden before he stretch forth his hand and take also of the fruit of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever...And He cast out Adam, and made the glory of His Shekina to dwell at the front of the east of the garden of Eden, above the two Kerubaia. Two thousand years before He had created the world, He created the law, and prepared Gehinnam and the Garden of Eden. He prepared the garden of Eden for the righteous, that they should eat, and delight themselves with the fruit of the tree, because they had kept the commandments of the law in this world. For the wicked He prepared Gehinnam, which is like the sharp, consuming sword with two edges. He prepared in the depth of it flakes of fire and burning coals for the wicked, for their punishment for ever in the world to come, who have not kept the commandment of the law in this world. For the law is the tree of life; whoever keepeth it in this life liveth and subsisteth as the tree of life. The law is good to keep in this world, as the fruit of the tree of life in the world that cometh.

Gen 4:7   If thou makest thy work good in this world, will it not be forgiven and remitted thee in the world to come? But if thou doest not make thy work good in this world, thy sin is retained unto the day of the great judgment; and at the door of thy heart it lieth. Yet into thy hand have I delivered power over evil passion, and to thee may be dominion over it, to become righteous or to sin.
Gen 4:8 And Kain said to Habel his brother, Come, and let us go forth upon the face of the field. And it was when they had gone out upon the face of the field, Kain answered and said to Habel his brother, There is neither judgment nor Judge, nor another world; neither is a good reward given to the righteous, nor will vengeance be taken of the wicked. Nor was the world created in goodness, nor in goodness is it conducted. Therefore it is that thy oblation was accepted with good will, and mine not accepted with good will. Habel answered and said to Kain, There is a judgment, and there is a Judge: there is another world, and a good reward is given to the righteous, and vengeance taken of the wicked. And in goodness was the world created, and in goodness is it conducted. But according to the fruit of good works is it conducted. Because my works were better ordered than thine, my offering was accepted with good will, and thine was not accepted with good will. And as they two disputed on the face of the field, Kain arose against Habel his brother, and killed him.

Gen 4:14 
Gen 4:15 
Gen 4:16 And Kain went out from before the Lord, and dwelt in the land of exile and wandering, eastward of the garden of Eden. And it had been before Kain slew Habel his brother that the earth multiplied fruits, as the fruits of the garden of Eden; (but) from (the time that) he sinned and killed his brother, it changed, to produce thorns and thistles.

Have I not imparted My Spirit to the sons of men, because they are flesh, that they may work good works? But they do works of evil. Behold, I have given them a prolongment of a hundred and twenty years, that they may work repentance; but they have not done it.

Gen 14:23 If from a thread to the latchet of a sandal I receive of all that is thing: that thou magnify not thyself and say, I have enriched Abram. 
Gen 14:24  
Gen 15:1  After these words, when all the kings of the lands, and the sultans of the provinces, had gathered together, and had made war against Abram the Just, and had fallen before him, and he had slain of them four kings, and had brought back nine hosts, did Abram the Just reason in his heart, and say, Woe, now, to me, because I have received the reward ordained in the present world, and have no portion in the world to come. Or peradventure the brethren and kindred of the slain who have fallen before me, who are in their cities and provinces, will combine in great legions, and come against me; or peradventure there were in my hand a few commandments in the former times, so that they fell before me when they had risen up against me; or it may be that righteousness was found in me at the former times, that they fell before me, but at the second time it may not be found, and the Heavenly Name will be profaned in me. Then was the word of prophecy from the Lord unto Abram the Righteous, saying, Fear not, Abram, though they should gather together and come against thee with many legions, My Word shall be thy reward and thy shield in this world, and a protector over thee all the days of the world to come. And though I deliver up thy adversaries before thee in this world, the reward of thy good works is prepared for thee also before Me in the world to come.
Gen 15:2  And Abram said, Before Thee I supplicate mercy, O Lord God. Manifold blessings Thou hast given me, and many hast Thou before Thee still to give: nevertheless, what profit have I who go from the world childless, and Eliezer, the son of my house, by whose hands signs were wrought for me in Damasek, expecteth in himself to be my heir?

Gen 15:10  And He brought before him all these, and divided them into divisions, and set one part over against its fellow; but the fowl He divided not.
Gen 15:11  And when the birds descended, they came not nigh the divisions: those birds are unclean fowl, and those unclean fowl are the kingdoms of the earth which are worshippers of idols, and which counsel evil counsels against the sons of Israel; but the integrity of the righteous Abram hindered them.
Gen 15:12 And when the sun was going to set, a sleep profound and sweet fell upon Abram. And, behold, Abram saw four kingdoms which should arise to bring his sons into subjection (and) Terror; the Greatness of Darkness Fell upon him: Terror, that is Bavel; Darkness, that is Media; Greatness, that is Greece; Fell, that is Edom, (Rome) that fourth kingdom which is to Fall, and never to rise again for ever and ever.

And lo, Gehinam, which was prepared for the wicked in the world to come, enveloped in burning flakes and flames of fire, into which the wicked had fallen when in their lives they rebelled against the law, while the just who had kept it had been delivered from affliction. And all were seen by Abram while He passed between those divisions.

I have gone in with thee before kings; before Pharoh King of Mizraim, and before Avimelek king of the Philistaee; and I have said of thee, he is my brother, so that they might not kill thee. And when I saw that I was not made fruitful, I took Hagar the Mizreitha, my handmaid, and gave her to thee to wife, and said, She shall bring forth, and I will bring up whom she may bear, that I may be builded, be it only from her. But now seeing that she hath conceived, my honour is contemned and despised in her sight. Now may the Lord appear, and judge between me and thee, and fulfil mercies upon me and thee, and spread His peace between me and thee, and replenish the world from me and from thee, that we may not heed the son of Hagar the Mizreitha handmaid, who is of the children of the people who cast thee into the burning furnace of the Kasdin.

The first angel was sent to announce to our father Abraham, that, behold, Sarah would bear Izhak; the second angel was sent to deliver Lot from the midst of the overthrow; the third angel was sent to overthrow Sedom and Amorah, Admah and Zeboim. Therefore was there a word of prophecy from before the Lord unto Abraham the Just, and the Word of the Lord was revealed to him in the valley of vision; and he sat in the door of the tabernacle, comforting himself from his circumcision in the fervour (or strength) of the day.

Gen 18:17 And the Lord with His Word said, Shall I hide from Abraham, My friend, that which I am about to do? Forasmuch as the town of Sedom is among the gifts that I have given to him, it is just that I should not overthrow it, till I have made it known to him.
Gen 18:18  
Gen 18:19 
Gen 18:20 
Gen 18:21  Now will I appear and see, according as the cry of the people of Sedom and Amorah hath ascended before Me, whether they have made a complete end. It may be, that some among these sinners do not know that their works of evil are manifest before Me. And if they seek to work repentance, behold, they shall be considered before Me as if those works had not been known.

Gen 19:1  And Lot sat in the gate of Sedom, and he saw them, and ran and saluted them, and bowed with his face to the ground. 
Gen 19:2  And wash your feet, and wash you in the morning, and go to your tents in peace. And they said to him, No; for in the open place of the city we will lodge.

Gen 19:24  And the Word of the Lord Himself had made to descend upon the people of Sedom and Amorah showers of favour, that they might work repentance from their wicked works. But when they saw the showers of favour, they said, So, our wicked works are not manifest before Him. He turned (then), and caused to descend upon them bitumen and fire from before the Lord from the heavens. 
Gen 19:25 
Gen 19:26  And because the wife of Lot was of the children of the people of Sedom, she looked behind her, to see what would be the end of her father's house: and, behold, she was made to stand a statue of salt, until the time of the resurrection shall come, when the dead shall arise.

Let the words be approved, and may Abraham the Just learn that I have not known thee.

Gen 21:33  And Abraham planted a paradise in Beer Sheba, and prepared in the midst of it food and drink for those who arrived at the border; and they ate and drank, and sought to give him the price of what they had eaten and drunk, but he willed not to receive it from them; but our father Abraham discoursed to them of that which he had said, that the world was by His word. Pray before your Father who is in heaven, from whose bounty ye have eaten and drunk. And they stirred not from their place until the time when he had made them proselytes, and had taught them the way everlasting. And Abraham praised and prayed there in the name of the word of the Lord, the God of Eternity.
Gen 21:34 
Gen 22:1  And it was after these things that the Lord tried Abraham with the tenth trial, and said to him, Abraham! And he said, Behold me.

Gen 22:9 
Gen 22:10  And Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to slay Izhak his son. Izhak answered and said to Abraham his father, My father, bind my hands rightly, lest in the hour of my affliction I tremble and confuse thee, and thy offering be found profane, and I be cast into the pit of destruction in the world to come. (Now) the eyes of Abraham reached unto the eyes of Izhak; but the eyes of Izhak reaching to the angels on high. And Izhak beheld them, but Abraham saw them not. In that hour came forth the angels on high, and said, these to these, Come, behold two righteous ones alone in the midst of the world: the one slayeth, the other is slain. He who slayeth deferreth not, and he who is to be slain stretcheth out his neck.
Gen 22:11  And He said, Abraham! Abraham! And Abraham answered in the language of the sanctuary, and said, Behold me. 
Gen 22:12 
Gen 22:13 
Gen 22:14  And Abrahm prayed in the name of the Word of the Lord, and said, Thou art the Lord who seest, and art not seen. I pray for mercy before Thee, O Lord. It is wholly manifest and known before Thee that in my heart there was no dividing, in the time that Thou didst command me to offer Izhak my son, and to make him dust and ashes before Thee; but that forthwith I arose in the morning and performed Thy word with joy, and I have fulfilled Thy word. And now I pray for mercies before Thee, O Lord God, that when the children of Izhak offer in the hour of need, the binding of Izhak their father Thou mayest remember on their behalf, and remit and forgive their sins, and deliver them out of all need. That the generations who are to arise after him may say, In the mountain of the house of the sanctuary of the Lord did Abraham offer Izhak his son, and in this mountain of the house of the sanctuary was revealed unto him the glory of the Shekinah of the Lord.

The first sign: the hours of the day were shortened for him, and the sun was hidden from him before its time, because His Word had desired to speak with him. The second sign: after our father Jakob had lifted up his feet from Beersheba, the country was shortened before him, and be found himself sitting in Haran. The third sign: the stones which Jakob our father had taken in the evening, and set as the resting-place of his head, when he had risen in the morning be found had all become one stone; and that is the stone which he set up in the first covenant, pouring oil upon the top of it. The fourth sign : when all the shepherds had gathered together at the stone to roll it from the mouth of the well, and could not, then came our father Jakob and lifted it with one hand, and watered the flock, of Laban his mother's brother. The fifth sign: after our father Jakob had lifted the stone from the mouth of the well, the well overflowed, and was overflowing twenty years; all the days that our father Jakob dwelt in Haran. These five signs were wrought for our father Jakob in the time when he departed from Beersheba to go to Charan.
Gen 28:11  
Gen 28:12  And he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder was fixed in the earth, and the summit of it reached to the height of heaven. And, behold, the angels who had accompanied him from the house of his father, ascended to make known to the angels on high, saying, Come, see Jakob the pious, whose likeness is in the throne of glory, and whom you have been desirous to see! And, behold, the holy angels from before the Lord ascended and descended, and looked upon him.

And Laban answered and said to them, Behold seven years are from the coming of this just man to us; our waterings have not failed, and our springs are many: and now come, give me counsel how we may settle (or subject) him among us yet seven years. And they gave him cunning counsel to take Leah to him instead of Rahel.

The key of rain : for thus the Scripture expoundeth, The Lord shall open unto thee His good treasure. The key of provender: for thus the Scripture expoundeth, Thou openest thine hand. The key of the sepulchre: for thus the Scripture expoundeth, When I shall open your sepulchre. The key of barrenness Scripture expoundeth, And Elohim remebered Rahel. And the Word of the Lord remembered Rahel in His good compassions, and the Word of the Lord heard the voice of her prayer, and He said in His Word that He would give her children.

And Shekem bar Hamor will not boast in his heart and say, As a woman who hath no man to avenge her injury, so hath Dinah the daughter of Jakob been made. And they said, As an impure woman and an outcast would he have accounted our sister.

Gen 35:9  The God of eternity, whose name be Blessed for ever and ever, hath taught us precepts which are beautiful and statutes that are comely: He hath taught us the blessing of matrimony from Adam and his bride, as the scripture expoundeth And the Word of the Lord blessed them, and the Word of the Lord said to them, Be strong and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it. He hath taught us to visit the afflicted, from our father Abraham the Righteous, when He revealed Himself to him in the plain of Vision, and gave him the precept of circumcision, and made him to sit in the door of his tent in the heat of the day; as the scripture expoundeth and saith, And the Word of the Lord revealed Himself to him in the plain of Vision. And again He hath taught us to bless those who mourn, from our father Jakob the Righteous: for He revealed Himself to him on his coming from Padan of Aram, when the way of the world had happened to Deborah, the nurse of Rivekah his mother, and Rahel died by him in the way, and Jakob our father sat weeping and bewailing her, and mourning and crying. Then wast Thou, 0 Lord of all worlds, in the perfection of Thy free mercies revealed to him, and didst comfort him, and blessing the mourners didst bless him concerning his mother, even as the scripture expoundeth and saith, The Word of the Lord revealed Himself unto Jakob the second time on his coming from Padan Aram, and blessed him.

And whereas thou hast said, I took the grapes and expressed them into the cup of Pharoh and gave the cup into Pharoh's hand: It is the cup of retribution which Pharoh is to drink at the last. As to thyself, the chief of the butlers, thou wilt not lose thy reward; for this dream which thou hast dreamed is good. Nevertheless the interpretation of the dream (as relating to himself) Joseph had not told him; but afterwards he explained it, when it pleased him. And Joseph said to him, The three branches are three days.

It will be that Pharoh kin, of Mizriam will decree evil decrees against Israel and throw their children into the river. Neverthless Pharoh will perish, and his host be destroyed, but the sons of Israel will go forth redeemed with uncovered head. And thou, the chief of the bakers wilt receive punishment; for this dream which thou bast dreamed is evil. But the interpretation of the dream Joseph did not (at once) make known to him; but afterwards Joseph expounded it, When it pleased him. And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of the dream. The three baskets are three days.

Gen 40:23  Joseph left the mercy above, and the mercy beneath, and the mercy which accompanied him from his father's house, and put his confidence in the chief butler: he trusted in the flesh, and the flesh be tasted of, even the cup of death. Neither did he remember the scripture where it is written expressly, Cursed shall be the man who trusteth in the flesh, and setteth the flesh as his confidence. Blessed shall be the man who trusteth in the Name of the Word of the Lord, and whose confidence is the Word of the Lord. Therefore the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgat him, until the time of the end came that he should be released.

And now thy judgments are returned like the judgments of Pharoh thy lord, by whom thou adjurest. Yet I am honourable as thou art, and my father is honourable as Pharoh thy lord is, by whom thou dost adjure. Can I not swear by the life of the head of my father, and not lie? For if I draw my sword from within its sheath, I would not return it till I had filled all the land of Mizraim with the slain; to its sheath I would not return it, till I had made all Mizraim desolate of inhabitants, beginning with thyself, and ending with Pharoh thy lord, were it not against the will of my father. Or, hath it not been heard by thee, or not told thee, what my two brothers Shimeon and Levi did, who went up against the town of Shekem, while they were dwelling in security, and killed every male by the edge of the sword, because they bad corrupted Dinah our sister, who hath not been numbered in the tribes, nor hath portion or inheritance with us in the dividing of the land? By how much more then (shall it be done) for Benjamin our brother, who is numbered with us among the tribes, and who hath portion and inheritance with us in the dividing of the land ? And in force is more unyielding than theirs, because I have become the sponsor for the youth at the hands of my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, and set him before thee, I will be guilty with thee and be removed from thy salutation all the days. Hast thou not beard, or hath it not been told thee, that in the land of Kenaan we are kings and princes, as thou art ?
Gen 44:19  When Joseph, the beloved and honourable, saw that the strength of Jehuda his brother bad risen up, and that the thoughts of his heart came forth, and that they rent their garments, in that hour beckoned Joseph to Menasheh his first-born, and stamped with his shoe; and all Joseph's palace trembled. In that hour Jehuda said, If it bad not been on the side of the house of my father, it would not have been done so. Then began Jehuda to be milder in his words, and he said, My lord asked his servants, saying, Have you a father, or a brother ?

Gen 49:1 And our father Jakob called his sons, and said to them, Gather together, and I will teach yon the concealed end, the secret mysteries, the recompense of reward for the just, and the punishment of the wicked, and the blessedness of Eden, what it is. And the twelve tribes of Jakob assembled and surrounded the golden bed whereon our father Jakob lay, desiring that he should teach them (at the) end in benediction and consolation. Then was revealed to him the secret that had been hidden from him, and then was opened the door which had been shut to him. Our father Jakob turned therefore and blessed his sons, every man according to his good did he bless him.
Gen 49:2 
Gen 49:3  REUBEN, my firstborn art thou, my strength, and the beginning of my sorrow. To thee my son Reuben would it have pertained to receive three portions above thy brethren, birthright, priesthood, kingdom: but because thou hast sinned, Reuben, my son, the birthright is given unto Joseph, the kingdom to Jehuda, and the high priesthood to the tribe of Levi. I will liken thee, my son Reuben, to a little garden into the midst of which there enter rapid torrents, which it cannot bear, but is carried away before them. Be repentant then, my son Reuben, with good works, for thou hast sinned; and sin no more, that that which thou hast sinned may be forgiven thee.
Gen 49:4 
Gen 49:5  Shimeon and Levi are brothers of the womb, men who are masters of sharp weapons; they made war from their youth; in the land of their adversary they wrought out the triumphs of war. 
Gen 49:6 In their counsels my soul found no pleasure; and in their gathering together at the city of Shekem to destroy it, they were not favourable to my honour; for in their anger they slew kings with princes, and in their wilfulness they sold Joseph their brother, who is compared to the ox. 
Gen 49:7 Accursed was the town of Shekem when Shimeon and Levi entered to destroy it in their wrath, for it was strong, and in their anger, for it was cruel. And Jakob our father said, If these remain together, no people or kingdom can stand before them. I will divide the tribe of Shimeon, that they may become preachers and teachers of the law in the congregation of Jakob; and I will disperse the tribe of Levi in the houses of instruction for the sons of Israel
Gen 49:8  JEHUDA, thee shall all thy brethren praise, and from thy name shall all be called Jehudaee; thy hand shall avenge thee of thy adversaries; all the sons of thy father shall come before thee with salutation.
Gen 49:9  I will liken thee, my son Jehuda, to a whelp the son of a lion: from the slaying of Joseph thou wast free, from the judgment of Tamar thou, my son, wast acquitted. He remaineth tranquil in the midst of war, as the lion and as the lioness; nor is there people or kingdom that can stand against thee.  
Gen 49:10 Kings shall not cease from the house of Jehuda, nor sapherim teaching the law from his children's children, until the time that the King Meshiha shall come, whose is the kingdom, and to whom all the kingdoms of the earth shall be obedient. How beauteous is the King Meshiha, who is to arise from the house of Jehuda.
Gen 49:11 Binding his loins, and going forth to war against them that hate him, he will slay kings with princes, and make the rivers red with the blood of their slain, and his hills white with the fat of their mighty ones; his garments will be dipped in blood, and he himself be like the juice of the winepress. 
Gen 49:12 More beautiful are the eyes of the king Meshiha to behold than pure wine; they will not look upon that which is unclean, or the shedding of the blood of the innocent. His teeth are employed according to the precept rather than in eating the things of violence and rapine; his mountains shall be red with vines, and his presses with his wine, and his hills be white with much corn and with flocks of sheep.
Gen 49:13 
Gen 49:14  ISSAKAR is a strong tribe, and his limits shall be in the midst between two boundaries. 
Gen 49:15 And he saw the house of the sanctuary, which is called Quietness, that it is good, and the land that its fruits are rich; and bared his shoulders to labour in the law, and to him shall be all his brethren bringing tribute.
Gen 49:16  DAN, He will be the deliverer who is to arise, strong will he be and elevated above all kingdoms.
Gen 49:17  And be will be like the serpent that lieth in the way, and the basilisk which lurketh at the dividing of the road, which striketh the horse in his heel, and thinketh by the terror of him to throw his rider backward. 
Gen 49:18 He is Shimshon bar Manovach (Sampson), who will be a terror upon his adversaries, and a fear upon them that hate him, and who will slay kings with princes. Our father Jakob said, My soul hath not waited for the redemption of Gideon bar Joash which is for an hour, nor for the redemption of Shimshon which is a creature redemption, but for the Redemption which Thou hast said in Thy Word shall come for Thy people the sons of Israel, for this Thy Redemption my soul hath waited.
Gen 49:19 From the house of GAD will go forth hosts arrayed in arms. They will bring Israel over Jardena put them in possession of the land of Kenaan, and afterwards return in peace to their tabernacles.
Gen 49:20 Of happy ASHER how fertile is the land! His land shall satisfy with dainties the kings of the sons of Israel.
Gen 49:21  NAPHTALI is a swift messenger declaring good tidings. He first declared to our father Jakob that Joseph was yet in life, and he went down to Mizraim in a little time, and brought the contract of the Double Field from the palace of Joseph. And when he openeth his mouth in the congregation of Jakob, his tongue is sweet as honey.
Gen 49:22  My son who hast become great, JOSEPH, my son, who hast become great, and waxed mighty, that thou wouldst become mighty was foreseen. Thee, Joseph, my son, will I liken to a vine planted by fountains of water, which sendeth her roots into the depth and striketh the ridges of the rocks, uplifting herself on high and surmounting all the trees. So hast thou, 0 Joseph my son, risen by thy wisdom above all magicians of Mizraim, and all the wise men who were there, what time thou didst ride in the second chariot of Pharoh, and they proclaimed before thee and said, This is the father of the king, Long live the, father of the king Great in wisdom, though few in years. And the daughters of kings and of princes danced before thee at the windows, and beheld thee from the balconies, and scattered before thee bracelets rings collars, necklaces, and all ornaments of gold, in hope thou wouldst uplift thine eyes and regard one of them. But thou my son Joseph wast far from lifting thine eyes on any one of them, though the daughters of kings and of princes spake one to another, This is the holy man Joseph, who walks not after the sight of his eyes nor after the imagination of his heart; because the sight of the eyes and the imagination of his heart make the son of woman to perish from the world. Therefore will arise from thee the two tribes MENASHEH and  EPHRAIM, who shall receive portion and inheritance with their brethren in the dividing of the land. 
Gen 49:23 The magicians of Mizraim and all the wise men spake against him, but could not prevail over him; they spake evil of him before his lord, they accused him before Pharoh king of Mizraim, to bring him down from his dignity; they spake against him in the palace of Pharoh with a slanderous tongue severe as arrows. 
Gen 49:24 
Gen 49:25 But the strength of his confidence remained in both his hands and his arms, and he sought mercy from the strength of his father Jakob, under the arms of whose power the tribes of Israel are led, and do come. Blessed are the breasts that suckled thee, and the womb in which thou didst lie. 
Gen 49:26 The blessing of thy father be added upon thee, upon the blessings wherewith thy fathers Abraham and Izhak who are like mountains blessed thee, and upon the blessing of the four mothers' Sarah, Rivekah, Rahel, and Leah, who are like hills; let all these blessings come, and make a diadem of majesty upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the man who became a chief and ruler in the land of Mizraim, and the brightness of the glory of his brethren.
Gen 49:27  BENJAMIN I will liken him to a ravening wolf. In his limits will the sanctuary be builded, and in his inheritance the glory of the Shekina of the Lord will dwell. In the morning will the priests offer the continual lamb and its oblations, and at the going down of the sun will the priests offer the continual lamb and its oblations, and at evening divide the offerings of the sons of Israel.

Gen 50:1  And Joseph laid him on a couch of ivory which was covered with pure gold, and inset with pearls, and spread with clothes of byssos and purple. There they poured out wine with choice perfumes, there they burned aromatic gums; there stood the chiefs of the house of Esau; there stood the princes of the house of Ishmael there stood the Lion Jehuda, the strength of his brethren. And Jehuda answered and said to his brethren, Come, let us raise up to our father a tall cedar, whose head shall reach to heaven, but whose branches unto the inhabitants of the world. From it have arisen the twelve tribes, from it the priests with their trumpets and the Levites with their harps. And they wept, and Joseph bowed himself on the face of his father, and wept over him and kissed him.

Exo 10:29  And Mosheh said, Thou hast spoken truly. But it was certified to me at the former time when I dwelt in Midian, that all the men were dead who sought to kill my life. At the end there will be no mercy upon thee. Yet I will pray for thee, and this plague shall be restrained. But a tenth plague is for Pharoh, of (which the victim will be) thy firstborn son. And Mosheh said to him, Thou hast spoken fairly the truth: I will see thy face no more.

Exo 12:43 It is a night to be observed and celebrated for the liberation from before the Lord in bringing forth the sons of Israel, made free from the land of Mizraim. Four nights are there written in the Book of Memorial. Night first; when the Word of the Lord was revealed upon the world as it was created; when the world was without form and void, and darkness was spread upon the face of the deep, and the Word of the Lord illuminated and made it light; and he called it the first night. Night second; when the Word of the Lord was revealed unto Abraham between the divided parts; when Abraham was a son of a hundred years, and Sarah was a daughter of ninety years, and that which the Scripture saith was confirmed,--Abraham a hundred years, can he beget? and Sarah, ninety year old, can she bear? Was not our father Izhak a son of thirty and seven years, at the time he was offered upon the altar? The heavens were (then) bowed down and brought low, and Izhak saw their realities, and his eyes were blinded at the sight, and he called it the second night. The third night; when the Word of the Lord was revealed upon the Mizraee, at the dividing of the night; His right hand slew the firstborn of the Mizraee, His right hand spared the firstborn of Israel; to fulfil what the Scripture hath said, Israel is My firstborn son. And he called it the third night. Night the fourth; when the end of the age will be accomplished, that it might be dissolved, the bands of wickedness destroyed and the iron yoke broken. Mosheh came forth from the midst of the desert; but the King Meshiha (comes) from the midst of Roma. The Cloud preceded that, and the Cloud will go before this one; and the Word of the Lord will lead between both, and they shall proceed together. This is the night of the Pascha before the Lord, to be observed and celebrated by the sons of Israel in all their generations.

Exo 13:18   And the Word of the Lord conducted the people by the way of the desert of the sea of Suph; armed in good works went up the sons of Israel, free from the land of Mizraim.
Exo 13:19  For, adjuring, he adjured the sons of Israel, saving, The Lord remembering; will remember you in is Word, and in His good mercies.
Exo 13:20  And the Word of the Lord conducted the people by the way of the desert of the sea of Suph; armed in good works went up the sons of Israel, free from the land of Mizraim. Which cometh upon the end of the desert.
Exo 13:21 
Exo 13:22  It ceased not.
Exo 14:1 
Exo 14:2  And they shall return and encamp before the caravansaries of Hiratha, between Migdol and the sea, before the idol of Zephon, ye shall encamp over against it. 
Exo 14:3  And Pharoh will say concerning the people of the sons of Israel, They are losing themselves in the wilderness: the idol of Peor hath shut them in before the desert.
Exo 14:4 
Exo 14:5  And it was declared to the king.
Exo 14:6 
Exo 14:7 
Exo 14:8  But the sons of Israel had gone out free.
Exo 14:9  Before the caravansaries of Hiratha, before the idol Zephon.
Exo 14:10 
Exo 14:11 
Exo 14:12 
Exo 14:13  Four companies made the sons of Israel, standing by the Weedy Sea. One said, Let us fall upon the sea; another said, Let us return to Mizraim; another said, Let us array battle against them; and another said, Let us shout against them to confuse them. To that company who said, Let us fall upon the sea, Mosheh said, Fear not; stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord which shall be wrought for you this day. To the company who said, We will return unto Mizraim, Mosheh said, Fear not; for as you have seen the Mizraee to-day, you will see them no more in bondage for ever. 
Exo 14:14 To the company who said, We will array battle against them, Mosheh said, Fear not; the Lord, in the glory of His Shekinah, will work the victory for your hosts. To the company who had said, Let us shout against them to confound them, Mosheh said, Fear not; stand and be silent; and give the glory, and praise, and exaltation unto Eloha.
Exo 14:15  And the Word of the Lord said to Mosheh, How long standest thou praying before Me ? Heard before Me are thy prayers; but the prayers of My people have preceded thine. Speak to the sons of Israel that they go forward; and thou, lift, up thy rod and stretch forth thy hand.
Exo 14:16

Exo 14:20  And the cloud was half light and half darkness: light, it enlightened upon Israel; and darkness, it darkened upon Mizraim. And those came not against these, to set battle in order, all the night.
Exo 14:21  And he stretched forth.
Exo 14:22 
Exo 14:23 
Exo 14:24  And it was in the time of the morning that the Word of the Lord looked upon the host of the Mizraee, and hurled upon them bitumen (naphtha), and fire, and stones of hail, and conturbed the host of the Mizraee. 
Exo 14:25  And he unloosed the wheels of their carriages, so that they went, dragging them after them: the mules, going after their way before the wheels, were turned, so as that the wheels went before the mules, and they were cast into the sea. The Mizraee answered and said on to another, Let us flee from before the people of the sons of Israel; for this is the Word of the Lord who worketh victory for them in their battles; so that they set the back against Mizraim.
Exo 14:26  Stretch forth.
Exo 14:27  And Mosheh stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned at the time of the morning to its place.
Exo 14:28
Exo 14:29
Exo 14:30
Exo 14:31
Exo 15:1  Then sang Mosheh and the sons of Israel the praise of this song, before the Lord, saying, to say: Thanksgiving and praise bring we before the Lord, who is high above the highest, and glorified above the glorious, and who punisheth by His Word whom. Whomsoever glorifieth himself before Him. The horses and their riders, because they bare themselves proudly and followed after the people of the house of Israel, He hath thrown and buried in the sea of Suph.
Exo 15:2  The Lord is Mighty, and greatly to be praised and feared over all the world. He spake in His Word, and for us became salvation. From their mothers' breasts have even the children given signs with their fingers unto the fathers, and have said to them, This is our Father, who nourished us with honey from the rock, and gave us oil from the stone of clay. The sons of Israel answered and said one to another, He is our God, and we will praise Him; the God of our fathers, and we will exalt Him.
Exo 15:3  The Lord in the glory of His Shekinah is He who worketh victory for your arms. From one generation to another He maketh known His power to the people of the house of Israel. His Name is the Lord: as is His Name, so is His power; let His name be glorified for ever and ever.

Exo 15:9  Pharoh the wicked, the hater and adversary, did say, I will follow after the people of the sons of Israel and will overtake them encamped at the side of the sea. I will lead them captive into great captivity, and despoil, them of great spoil; I will divide their substance among my men of war; and when my soul shall be satisfied with them, I will sheathe my sword, when I shall have destroyed them with my right hand.
Exo 15:10  The sea and the earth had controversy one with the other. The sea said to the earth, Receive thy children; and the earth said to the sea, Receive thy murderers. But the earth willed not to swallow them, and the sea willed not to overwhelm them. And by the Word from before Thee Thou. didst stretch forth Thy right hand in oath., and didst swear unto the earth that Thou wilt not require them of her in the world to come. Then did the earth open her mouth and swallow them up.

Exo 15:17  Thou wilt bring them in, and wilt plant them in the mountain of Thy inheritance, the dwelling of the glory of Thy holiness, which Thou 0 Lord, hast prepared for Thyself, the sanctuary of the Lord that with both hands He hath established.}
Exo 15:18  When the house of Israel had beheld the signs and wonders that the Holy One, Blessed be He, had wrought for them at the border of the sea, let His great Name be blessed for ever and ever,­ they gave glory and thanksgiving and exaltation unto their God. The sons of Israel answered and said one to another, Come, let us set the crown upon the head of the Redeemer, who causeth to pass over, but is not passed; who changeth, but is not changed; the King of kings in this world; whose, too, is the crown of the kingdom of the world to come, and whose it will be for ever and ever.

Exo 19:4  You have seen what vengeance I have taken of the Mizraee, and (how) I bare you upon the light clouds as upon eagles' wings, and brought you nigh to the doctrine of My law. 
Exo 19:5  And now, if you will truly hearken to the voice of My Word, and will keep My covenant, you shall be unto My Name a distinct people, and beloved as a precious treasure above all peoples; for all the earth is to the Name of the Lord.
Exo 19:6  And to My Name shall you be kings and priests and a holy people. These are the words thou shalt speak.
Exo 19:7  And Mosheh came and called the sages of Israel and set in order before them all these words which the Word of the Lord had commanded him.
Exo 19:8  And all the people answered together in the fulness of their heart, and said, All that the Word of the Lord hath spoken, we will do. And Mosheh returned the words of the people in prayer before the Lord.
Exo 19:9  And the Word of the Lord said to Mosheh, Behold, My Word will be revealed to thee in the thickness of the cloud, that the people may hear while I speak with thee, and may also believe for ever in the words of the prophecy of thee, My servant Mosheh. And Mosheh delivered the words of the people in prayer before the Lord.

In every place in which ye shall memorialize My holy Name, My Word shall be revealed to you, and bless you. But if you make an altar of stones unto My Name, you shall not build it with sculptured ones, because the sword is made of iron. If thou workest with iron upon it, thou wilt profane it. 
Exo 20:23  You also, the priests, the sons of Aharon, who stand and minister beside Mine altar, shall not ascend by steps unto Mine altar, lest your shame be disclosed upon it.

Lev 1:1 And it was when Mosheh had completed to erect the tabernacle to anoint it, and sanctify it, and all its vessels, that Mosheh reasoned in his heart, and said: Within Mount Sinai, whose majesty was the majesty of an hour, and its holiness the holiness of an hour, I might not ascend till the time which was bidden me from before the Lord; nor into the tabernacle of ordinance, whose majesty is an eternal majesty, and its holiness an everlasting holiness, is it right for me to enter till the time that I am bidden from before the Lord. And the Word of the Lord called to Mosheh; for the Word of the Lord was altogether with him, from the tabernacle of ordinance, saying:

Lev 1:17  And he shall cut it through its wings, but not to dissever; and the priest shall lay it in order upon the, altar, on the wood that is upon the fire.

Lev 10:19  They have brought their sin offerings and their burnt sacrifice before the Lord; and I have been instructed that these of the sin offering are more weighty than those of the second tythes, of which it is not allowed to the mourner to eat; and to me hath been a great sorrow this day through the death of my two sons Nadab and Abihu: and consider, if, while mourning over them, I were to eat to-day of the sin offering, I should do what would not be pleasing or right before the Lord. When Mosheh had heard, and the word was pleasing in his sight, he sent out a herald through all the camp of Israel, and said, I am he from whom the rite had been hidden; but Aharon my brother hath taught it unto me. And because Mosheh humbled himself, he received thereupon a great reward.
Lev 10:20  For Mosheh heard, and the word was pleasing before him.

Lev 22:33  In the time that thou remindest us of the order of the oblations as they are to be offered year by year; our offerings are to make atonement for our sins. But when our sins have given occasion, and we have not wherewith to bring from our flocks of sheep, a bullock is to be chosen before Me to recall to remembrance­ the elder of the east, sincere altogether, Who brought to Thy Name a calf tender and good, Which he gave to the young man, who basted to dress it, and to bake unleavened cakes; and the angels did eat, and be was accounted worthy to receive the announcement that, behold, Sarah should give birth to Izhak. A lamb is to be chosen, secondly, to call to remembrance the righteousness of the prince who suffered himself to be bound upon the alter, and stretched forth his neck for Thy Name's sake; when the heavens stooped down and condescended, and Izhak beheld their foundations, and his eyes were blinded by the high things (or, from the heights), on which account be was held worthy that a lamb should be provided in his stead for a burnt offering. A kid of the goats also is to be chosen, to call to remembrance the righteousness of that perfect one who put on the skins of the kids, and made savory meat, and brought of his viands unto his father, and gave wine to him to drink; on account of which he was held worthy to receive the orders of blessings from Izhak his father, that the twelve sacred tribes should arise to Thy Name. Behold, then, how Mosheh, the prophet of the Lord, expoundeth, and saith, Sons of Israel, my people, When a bullock, or a lamb, or a goat is brought forth, it shall be seven days after its dam; on the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be fit to be offered as an oblation to the Name of the Lord.

Lev 24:12  This is one of four judgments that were brought before Mosheh our Rabbi. In two of them was Mosheh slow by delay, and in two of them was Mosheh expeditious. With the blasphemer who blasphemed the Holy Name with scoffings and with the gatherer of sticks who profaned the Sabbath, Mosheh had delay, because they were judgments that affected life; but in the case of unclean persons who could not perform the Pascha in its time, and in that of the daughters of Zelophehad, Mosheh could be prompt, because they were judgments on temporal matters. But to those he would say, I have not heard: to teach the judges who were to arise after Mosheh to be slow in judgments on life and to be expeditious in judgments of Mammon; and not to be ashamed to say, I have not heard; for Mosheh our Rabban said, I have not heard. And they shut him up in confinement, while as yet it had not been explained to them from before the Lord with what judgments they were to deal with him.

Yet the land shall be forsaken by you, and shall enjoy the repose of her remission (times) all the days that she is deserted of you. And they shall be broken for their sins; with measure for measure, and orders for orders, because they spurned the order of My judgments. Yet for this, when dwellers in the land of their enemies, I will not spurn them away in the kingdom of Babel, nor abhor them in the kingdom of Madai, nor destroy them in the kingdom of Javan, (Greece) to abolish My covenant with them in the kingdom of Edom; for He (will be) the Lord your God in the days of Gog.

Lev 27:27 
Lev 27:28  Only no devoted thing that a man shall separate to the Name of the Lord of anything, that he hath of child or cattle; every separation is most sacred to the Name of the Lord.
Lev 27:29  Every one of the children of men set apart (or devoted) shall not be redeemed; dying, he shall be put to death.
Lev 27:30  It pertaineth to the Name of the Lord; it is holy unto the Name of the Lord. 
Lev 27:31  But if a man will redeem any portion of his tythe, let him add upon, it a fifth part of its price; 
Lev 27:32 and every tythe of ox and sheep, whatever passeth under the rod, a tenth shall be holy Unto the Name of the Lord. 
Lev 27:33 He shall not scrutinize between good and bad, nor exchange it; but if he will change it, then shall both it and that for which it is changed be sacred, and not be redeemed. 
Lev 27:34 These are the Commandments.

Num 9:6  This is one of four matters of judgment brought before Mosheh, in two of which Mosheh was prompt, and in two was he slower. Concerning the unclean who could not perform the Pascha in its time, and concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, was Mosheh prompt, because the latter judgment was about money; but concerning the blasphemer who had reviled the sacred Name, and the gatherer of wood, who wickedly profaned the Sabbath, Mosheh was deliberate, they being decisions involving life; and in them he said, I have not heard; that he might teach the judges who were to come after Mosheh to be prompt in cases of mammon, but deliberate in those of life; and not to be ashamed to say, I have not heard, because Mosheh our Rabbi himself said, I have not heard.

Num 9:8 Therefore, spake he, Arise, and listen to what the Word of the Lord will prescribe to you.

Num 10:35  It was when the ark went forward. Mosheh stood, with hands (outstretched) in prayer, and said, Arise now, O Word of the Lord, in the power of Thy might, and let the adversaries of Thy people be scattered, and make Thine enemies flee before Thee.
Num 10:36  But when the ark rested, Mosheh lifted his hands in prayer, and said, O Word of the Lord, turn from the strength of Thy anger, and return unto us in the goodness of Thy mercy, and bless the myriads and multiply the thousands of the children of Israel.

Num 11:26  And there remained two men in the camp: the name of one of them Eldad, the name of the second Medad, upon whom rested the Holy Spirit. Eldad prophesied, and said: Lo, Mosheh, the prophet, the scribe of Israel, will be gathered from the world, and Jehoshua bar Nun, his disciple, minister of the camps, will succeed. Medad prophesied, and said: Behold, quails come up from the sea; but they will be an offence to the children of Israel. Both of them prophesied together, and said: At the end, the end of the days, will Gog and Magog and his host come up against Jerusalem; but by the hand of the King Meshiha they will fall, and seven years of days will the children of Israel kindle their fire with their weapons of war, not going into the wilderness, nor cutting down the trees. And they were of the seventy sages, who went not from the tabernacle, while Eldad and Medad prophesied in the camp.

Num 12:1  And Miriam and Aharon spake against Mosheh about the Kushaitha whom he had taken. But observe, the Kushite wife was not Zipporah, the wife of Mosheh, but a certain Kushaitha, of a flesh different from every creature: whereas Zipporah, the wife of Mosheh, was of a comely form and beautiful countenance, and more abundant in good works than all the women of her age.

Num 12:11  That we have sinned.
Num 12:12  Let not Miriam, our sister, be a leper, polluted in the tent as one dead. For it is with her as with the infant who hath passed nine months in its mother's womb, in water and in heat, without injury, but which after all perishes at the birth. So was Miriam, our sister, carried away with us into the desert, and with us in our trouble; but now the time hath come that we may enter into the land of Israel, why should she be kept from us? Pray now for the dead body that it may live, and that her righteousness may not fail.
Num 12:13   O Eloha, who healest all flesh, heal her.
Num 12:14
Num 12:15 
Num 12:16 But though Miriam the prophetess had become liable to leprosy, we have ample doctrine that by keeping the commandments and precepts a man who doeth even a little shall receive a great reward. Thus, because Miriam the prophetess had stood on the river bank for a little hour, to know what would be the end of Mosheh, the sons of Israel, being sixty myriads, and eighty legions in number, and the Cloud of Glory and the well, now moved not, nor went forward from their place, till the time that she was healed of her leprosy; but after she was healed the people journeyed from Hatseroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Pharan.

Num 20:29  In that hour the sons of Israel believed that Aharon was dead; and all the congregation of the children of Israel wept for Aharon thirty days.
Num 21:1  And when the Kenaanite, king Arad, who dwelt in the south, heard that Aharon was dead, that holy man on account of whose merit the Cloud of Glory had protected Israel; that the pillar of the Cloud had been taken up; and that the prophetess Miriam was dead, on whose account the well had flowed, but had (since) been hidden; he answered and said, Ye servants of war, come and let us set battle in line against Israel; for we shall find the way by which the explorers came up. Therefore they set battle in line against Israel, and carried away some of them with a great captivity.

Num 21:6  The bath-kol came forth from the midst of the earth, and a voice was heard from the heights, See, all men, and listen and hear, all ye children of flesh. The serpent, whom I cursed at the beginning, and said to him, Dust shall be thy food, hath not complained about his food. I led forth My people from Mizraim free, and caused the manna to descend for them from heaven; I made the quails to come over to them, and the well to spring up from the deep; yet now they again complain before Me on account of the manna, saying, Our soul is aggrieved by this light bread: therefore shall the serpent who hath not complained of his food come and bite this people who have murmured about their food. So the Word of the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, and a great multitude of Israel died.
Num 21:7 
Num 21:8 
Num 21:9  And Mosheh made a serpent of brass, and set it upon a high place; and it was that when any one had been bitten by a serpent, and his face was uplifted in prayer unto his Father who is in heaven, and he looked upon the brazen serpent, he lived.

Num 21:16  Therefore it is said in the Book of the Law of the Lord, which is likened to a Book of Wars: The miracles and mighty acts which the Lord wrought for His people, the sons of Israel, when they stood by the Red Sea, so did He with them when they were at the fords of the vale of Arnona. When the children of Israel were passing through the vale of Arnona, the Moabites were hidden in the caverns of the valley, saying: When the Beni Israel are coming through, we will go forth to prevent them, and will slay them. But the Lord of all the world, the Lord, who knew what was in their hearts, for before Him that which is within the reins is manifest, the Lord signed to the mountains, and their heads here and there were brought together, and the chiefs of their mighty ones were crushed, and the valleys were overflowed with the blood of the slain. But Israel walked above upon on the top of the hills, and knew not the miracle and mighty act which the Lord was doing for them in the valley of Arnon. But Lechaiath, the city which took no part in their counsel, was delivered from them; and, behold, it is by the confines of the Moabites. 
Num 21:17  Behold then sang Israel this song of praise: Spring up, O well! they sang to it, and it sprang up:
Num 21:18  the well which Abraham, Izhak, and Jakob, the princes of the world, at the beginning did see, the sages of the world, the Sanhedrin the seventy wise men who were appointed by name beheld it: Mosheh and Aharon, the scribes of Israel, found it with their rods, and from the desert it was given to them as a gift.
Num 21:19  And from thence the well was given to them at Mattana, turning it became strong overflowing streams, and again it ascended to the top of the mountains, and went down with them to the ancient valleys; but the well was hidden from them when on the borders of Moab, on the head of the height which overlooketh toward Abeth Jeshimon.

Num 21:28  Because the men of their people like fire come out of Heshbon, making war as flames of fire from the city of Sihon: the kings of the Amoraee are slain, the villages of the Moabite cities are destroyed, and the priests are slaughtered who sacrificed before the idols of Arnona. 
Num 21:29  Woe to you of Moab! Ye are consumed, destroyed, O worshippers of the idol of Kemosh; your sons and daughters bound by the collar are carried into the captivity of Sihon, king of the Amorites. 
Num 21:30  And the kingdom hath ceased from Heshbon, and the ruler from Dibon, and his ways are made desolate unto the smithies which are nigh to Medaba.
Num 21:31 And Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 
Num 21:32 And Mosheh sent to explore Makvar, and they took the villages, and destroyed the Amorites who were there.
Num 21:33 And when Mosheh saw Og, he said, Is not this Og the Wicked, who taunted Abraham and Sarah, and said, They are like fair trees by fountain of water, but give no fruit. Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, hath kept him alive for many years, till the time that he should see their children and children's children, and fall by their hands.
Num 21:34   Therefore the Lord said to Mosheh, Fear him not, for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and all his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou hast done to Sichon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon.

Behold, me, an unclean beast, who am to die in this world and not to enter the world to come, thou hast not power with all thy skill to curse; how much less the children of Abraham, Izhak, and Jakob, on whose account the world was created at the beginning! And why art thou going to curse them? For thou hast deceived the people, saying to them, This is not my ass: she is a loan in my hand. But am I not thy ass, upon whom thou hast ridden from thy youth unto this day? Did I indeed intend to do thus with thee? And he said to her, No.

Num 23:8 Wherewith shall I curse the house of Jakob, when the Word of the Lord blesseth them? and how shall I diminish the house of Israel, when the Word of the Lord doth multiply them? 
Num 23:9 I see this people, who are conducted through the merit of their righteous fathers, Abraham, Izhak, and Jakob, who are like the mountains, and of their four mothers, Sarah, Rivekah, Rahel, and Leah: behold, this people shall dwell alone, and not be mixed with the laws of the Gentiles.
Num 23:10   Who can number the youth of the house of Jakob, of whom it is said, They are to be like the stars of the skies? Bileam the wicked said, in the parable of his prophecy, If Israel do kill him with the sword Bileam himself declareth that he hath no portion in the world to come: but if Bileam may die as the faithful die, may his last end be as one of the least among them.

The Word of the Lord is with them, and the trumpet of their glorious King protecteth them. Unto God who redeemed, and brought them out from Mizraim free, belong power, and praise, and exaltation. For I see not those who perform divination in the house of Jakob, nor them who enchant with enebantments among the tribes of Israel. At this time it is said to Jakob, What bounties and comforts are prepared of the Lord to bestow upon you of the house of Jakob! Then said he in the parable of his prophecy, O happy saints, how goodly is the reward prepared for you by your Father in heaven, in the world to come!
Num 23:24  Behold, these people dwell as a lion, like the strong lion; as the lion resteth not, nor is quiet, until he hath taken and eaten flesh and drunk up blood, so this people will rest not, nor be in quiet, till they have slain their enemies, and have shed the blood of their slaughtered foes like water.

Num 24:1  And Bileam saw that it was pleasing before-the Lord to bless Israel, so that he went not, as he had gone from time to time, to seek for divinations, or to provide enchantments; but went and set his face toward the wilderness to recall to memory their work of the calf, (still) being desirous to curse Israel.
Num 24:2 
Num 24:3  And he took up in parable his prophecy and said: Bileam the son of Beor saith; the man saith who is more honourable than his father, for what hath been hidden from all prophets is revealed to him;
Num 24:4  the man saith who heard the Word from before the Lord, and who saw the vision before the Almighty; when, inquiring, prostrate on his face, the mysteries of prophecy were disclosed to him, and of himself he did prophesy that he shall fall by the sword, a prophecy to be confirmed at the end!
Num 24:5  How goodly were the tabernacles in which Jakob their father did pray; and the tabernacle of ordinance which you have made to My name, and your own tabernacles, O house of Israel!
Num 24:6  As torrents that prevail, so shall Israel overpower their adversaries; and as gardens planted by fountains of water, so shall be their cities, giving forth scribes and teachers of the law; and as the heavens which the Memra of the Lord spread forth for the dwelling of His Shekinah, so shall Israel live, and endure unto eternity, beautiful and renowned as cedars by the waters which grow up oil high.
Num 24:7  Their King will arise from among their children, and their Redeemer will be of them and among them; and He will gather their captives from the cities of their adversaries, and their children shall have rule among the peoples. And the kingdom of the King Meshiha shall be made great: stronger is He than Shaul who vanquished Agag the king of the Amalkaab.
Num 24:8  Unto God who redeemed, and brought them out free from the land of Mizraim, belong power, and praise, and exaltation. The sons of Israel will prevail over their enemies, will divide their cities, slay their heroes, and disperse their residue.
Num 24:9  Behold, these people will dwell as a lion, and be as the strong lions. He who blesseth you, O Israel, shall be blessed, as Mosheh the prophet, the scribe of Israel; and he who curseth you will be accursed, as Bileam, the son of Beor.
Num 24:10  And Balak's anger grew strong against Bileam, and Balak smote his hands, and said to Bileam, I brought thee to curse my enemies, and thou hast only blessed.
Num 24:11 
Num 24:12 
Num 24:13 
Num 24:14  And now, behold, I go to my people. Come now, I will counsel thee how thou art to act with this people. Lead them into sin; for else thou canst have power against them to prevail over thy people at the end of the days.
Num 24:15  And he took up the parable of his prophecy, and said: Bileam the son of Beor saith; the man who is more honourable than his father saith, for what hath been hid from all the prophets is revealed unto me:
Num 24:16  the man speaketh who heard the Word from before the Lord, and learned knowledge from the Most High; who saw the vision in the presence of the Almighty, seeking prostrate on his face, when the visions of prophecy were disclosed to him, and he was made to foreknow of himself that he will fall by the sword, but that his prophecy will be confirmed.
Num 24:17  I shall see Him, but not now; I shall behold Him, but He is not nigh. A King is to arise from the house of Jakob, and a Redeemer and Ruler from the house of Israel, who will slay the strong ones of the Moabaee, and bring to nothing and consume all the children of the east. 
Num 24:18  And Edom may inherit Mount Gabela from their enemies but Israel will be stronger with a mighty host.
Num 24:19  A King will arise from the house of Jakob, and destroy what shall remain of the strong city
Num 24:20  And he beheld the Amalkaah, and took up the parable of his prophecy and said: The house of Amalek was the first of the peoples to make war with Israel, and at last in the end of the days they will array battle against them; but their end is to perish, and their destruction to be for ever.
Num 24:21  And when he looked upon the Shalmaia, taking up the parable of his prophecy, he said, How strong is thy abode, who hast set the house of thy dwelling in the clefts of the rock! 
Num 24:22 But the Shalmaia will not be spoiled, until Athuria shall arise, and take thee captive.
Num 24:23  Woe to him who is alive when the Word of the Lord setteth Himself to give the good reward to the just, and to take vengeance on the wicked!
Num 24:24  And great hosts in Livernia will come from the great city, and will conjoin with them many legions of the Romaee, and subjugate Athuria, and afflict all the children beyond the river. Nevertheless the end of these and of those is to perish, and the destruction to be everlasting. 
Num 24:25  And Bileam rose up and went to return to his place; and Balak also.
Num 25:1  And Israel abode in Shittim; and the people began to commit fornication with the daughters of the Moabites.
Num 25:2  And they invited the people to the sacrifices of their idols. 
Num 25:3  And Israel were united with the worshippers of the idol of Peor; and the anger of the Lord was strong against Israel.
Num 25:4  And the Word of the Lord said to Mosheh, Take all the chiefs of the people and set them for a Sanhedrin before the Lord, and let them bang all who are worthy of death; and at sunset take down their bodies and bury them, that so may be averted the strong anger of the Lord from Israel. 
Num 25:5  And Mosheh said to the princes of Israel, Slay each one a man of his house of them who have joined themselves to the idol of Peor.
Num 25:6  And, behold, a man of the sons of Israel came and brought to his brethren a Midianitha, before Mosheh and all the congregation of the children of Israel; and, behold, they were weeping at the door of the tabernacle. 
Num 25:7  And Phinehas bar Elazar bar Aharon, the high priest, saw, and arose from among the assembly, and took a lance.
Num 25:8  And he went in after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them, the man and the woman, through the body; and the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.

Num 25:10

In the world to come may it stand to us, in the day of the great judgment, to propitiate for our souls before the Lord.

Deu 1:1  These are the words that Mosheh, spake with all Israel, reproving them, while as yet they were situate beyond the Jordan. Mosheh answering said to them: Was it not in the wilderness at Mount Sinai, that the law was given to you? And on the plains of Moab was shown you what miracles and mighty acts the Word of the Lord had wrought on your behalf. When you stood by the Weedy Sea, the sea was divided before you, and there were made twelve ways of one way, (a path) for each tribe. Yet you provoked Him at the sea, and rebelled at the Sea of Suph. On account of the matter of the spies who had been sent from the wilderness of Pharan, the decree (came forth) against you, that you should not enter into the land of Israel; and for that of the manna, of which you said, Our soul is afflicted with this bread, whose eating is too light, the serpents were let loose upon you; and in Hazeroth, where your carcasses fell on account of the flesh, and concerning the calf that you had made, He would have spoken in His Word to destroy you, had He not been mindful of the covenant which He sware to your fathers, Abraham, Izhak, and Jakob, and of the tabernacle of ordinance which you had made unto His name, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and of your burnt sacrifices in the midst (of the tabernacle and the ark) which you covered with purified gold. A journey of eleven days is it from Mount Horeb by way of Mount Gebal unto Rekem Giah; yet, because you sinned and provoked anger before Him, you have been delayed, and have been journeying for forty years. And it was at the end of forty years.

Deu 3:2  When Mosheh saw that wicked one, he trembled before him, and said, Is not this he who did scoff at our father Abraham and Sarah, and said to them, Ye are like trees planted by a fountain of water, but ye bear no fruit? Therefore did the Holy One, blessed be He, and let His Name be glorified, cause him to wait, and prolong him many years alive, to show to him the generations, because He would deliver him into the hands of his (Abraham's) children: therefore the Word of the Lord said to Mosheh, Be not afraid of him, for into thy hand have I given him up, and all his people, and his land, and thou shalt do to him as thou hast done to Sihon. king of the Amoraee, who dwelt in Heshbon.

Deu 6:4  When the end had come to our father Jakob, that he should be taken up from the world, he called the twelve tribes, his sons, and gathered them round his couch. Then Jakob our father rose up, and said to them, Do you worship any idol that Terah the father of Abraham worshipped? Do you worship any idol that Laban (the brother of his mother) worshipped? Or worship you the God of Jakob? The twelve tribes answered together, with fulness of heart, and said, Hear now, Israel our father: The Lord our God is one Lord. Jakob responded and said, May His Great Name be blessed for ever!

Deu 26:13 
Deu 26:14  We have not eaten thereof in (our) mourning, nor separated therefrom for the unclean, nor given of it for the defiled soul; for we have obeyed the voice of the Word of the Lord our God; we have done according to all that Thou hast commanded us.
Deu 26:15  Look down, we beseech Thee, from the heavens, the habitation of Thy glory and Thy holiness, and bless Thy people Israel, and the land which Thou hast given us, as Thou didst swear unto our fathers (to give us a land) producing good fruits, pure as milk, sweet and delicious as honey.

Deu 27:15 Blessed be the man who hath not made an image, or a figure, or any similitude which the Lord hateth, and which is an abomination before Him, (being) the work of man's band, and who bath not hidden such. But in pronouncing the curses let them turn their faces toward Mount Ebal, and say: Accursed be the man who shall make an image, or figure, or any similitude which the Lord hateth and which is an abomination to Him, the work of man's hands; or the man who hath concealed such. And all the people shall answer them, and say, Amen. 
Deu 27:16 
Deu 27:17  Accursed be the man who changeth the bound mark.

Deu 29:17  Lest there be among you man or woman, family or tribe, whose heart is turned away this day from the Lord our God to go and worship the idols of these people, or there be a man among you whose heart pondereth upon sin, which is like a root struck into the earth; for its beginning may be sweet as honey, but its end will be bitter as the deadly wormwood;

Deu 30:14  For the word is very nigh you, in your mouth, that you may meditate upon it, and in your hearts, that you may perform it. See, behold, I have set before you this day the way of life, which is the path of the good, and the way of death, which is the path of the evil.

Deu 32:1 When the end of Mosheh came that he should be removed from the world, he said: Behold, I testify in this world a thing which tasteth not of death; so will I attest against them the heavens and earth which taste not of death in this world, but whose end is to be consumed in the world that cometh. For so he explained, and said: Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and consider the earth beneath; for the heavens shall dissolve like smoke, and the earth fade away as a garment; but I have prepared to create new heavens and a new earth. Isaiah the prophet, when he prophesied in the congregation of Israel, because he was remote from the heavens and nearest the earth, attributed hearing to the heavens, and attention to the earth: for so be explaineth, and saith: Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth; for the Word of the Lord hath spoken.  
Deu 32:2  The doctrine of my law shall be sweet to the children of Israel as the rain, the word Of my mouth will be received by them with pleasantness as the dew, as the wind which breathes upon the herb, and as the drops of the latter rain that descend and water the herbage of the ground in Nisan.
Deu 32:3  Mosheh the prophet said: Woe to the wicked who make memorial of the Holy Name with blasphemies. For it is not possible even to one of the highest angels to utter that Name rightly until that they have said, Holy, Holy, Holy thrice. And from them did Mosheh learn not to utter that Name openly until he should have dedicated his mouth with twenty-one words which consist of eighty-five letters; and so explained he and said: Hear, ye heavens, and I will speak; for it is the Name of the Lord. Mosheh the prophet said: O people of Israel, I invoke you, in the Name of the Lord, to give glory, praise, and highest exaltation unto God. 
Deu 32:4  (The same words to) three hours, uniting the marriage yoke of the husband to the wife ...a faithful God and true; falsehood is not before Him; He is just and upright in judgment. 
Deu 32:5  The children have corrupted their works, and not them only, but themselves also: they have so corrupted that the spot is upon them; a depraved and perverse generation which changeth its order of this world shall be changed upon it.
Deu 32:6  Do you return this before the Lord, O people foolish and unwise? Is He not your Father who is in heaven, who bought you? He created and founded you.
Deu 32:7  Be mindful of the days, the days of old, consider the years of one generation and another; ask your fathers who are greater in the law than you, and they will teach you, the sages, and they will tell you.
Deu 32:8  When the Most High divided the nations by lot, and distinguished the languages of the children of men, He appointed the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the tribes of the Beni Israel.
Deu 32:9  Because the Lord's portion are His people, and the house of Jakob the lot of His inheritance.
Deu 32:10  He found them wandering in a desert land, in the solitude of a howling wilderness; He threw over them clouds of glory; His Shekinah taught them the Ten Words, watched over them, and kept them as the apple of His eye.
Deu 32:11  As an eagle stirreth up his nest, and carefully spreadeth out his wings, and taketh and beareth them with the strength of his wings.
Deu 32:12  The Lord alone caused them to dwell, and none were among them who served with strange worship.
Deu 32:13  He made them ride upon the high places of the earth, and gave them to eat of royal delicacies, and nourished them with honey out of the rock, and with oil from their olives (growing) out of the flinty stone of the rock.
Deu 32:14  Tender oxen and choice flocks, goodly fatlings, rams bred in Batenaia, and goats, with the richest of the wheat. Mosheh the prophet said: If the children of Israel will observe the precepts of the law; from one bunch they shall drink a cup of wine.
Deu 32:15  But the house of Jeshuron ate and kicked; they became rich, and rebelled; they prospered, got wealth, and forsook the Word of God who had created them, and refused to worship the Almighty who had redeemed them. 
Deu 32:16  They provoked Him to anger with their idols, by their abominations they made Him wroth
Deu 32:17  They sacrificed to demons in whom is no stability, idols which they had not known, lately formed, which your fathers remembered not.
Deu 32:18  The Almighty who created you ye have forgotten, and have forsaken the Word of God who gave you to be, and made you so many refuges.
Deu 32:19  And it was manifest before the Lord, and He was angry, because the beloved children had provoked Him, even they who were beloved by Him as sons and daughters.
Deu 32:20  And He said, I will surely turn away the favor of My countenance from them; I will see what will be in their latter end; for they are a perverse generation, children in whom is no faith.
Deu 32:21  They have moved Me to jealousy by their idols in which there is nothing whatever, they have provoked Me by their abominations; but I also will move them to jealousy by a people which is not a people, by a foolish nation will I anger them.
Deu 32:22  For a fire shall come forth in the hour of My wrath, and burn to the lowest hell, devouring the earth and its fullness, and setting in flame the foundations of the hills.
Deu 32:23  I have spoken in My Word to bring evil upon them, the arrows of My vengeance will I send among them: 
Deu 32:24  gaping with famine, devoured by unclean fowl, filled with evil spirits, even the teeth of the four kingdoms, which are like wild beasts, will I send among them, with the poison of serpents, the reptiles of the earth.
Deu 32:25  In the street the sword will devour them; in the chambers where they sleep, the terrors of death; their young men and maidens, their infants and aged men.
Deu 32:26  I have spoken in My Word to bring wrath upon them and to cause their memorial to fail from among men;
Deu 32:27 
Deu 32:28 But that the wrath of the enemy would wax strong, that they could not prevail against their foes; and that they may not say, Our hand hath avenged us on our adversaries, and it hath not been done by the Lord; for this people perish by evil counsels, and they are void of understanding.
Deu 32:29 If Israel were but wise, learning the law they would understand what shall be in their latter end.
Deu 32:30   When Israel was diligent in the law, and observed the commandments, one of them chased a thousand, and two of them put ten thousand to flight; but because they have sinned and vexed the Almighty to anger, He hath left them to the hand of their enemies.
Deu 32:31  For the confidence of the nations is not as our confidence, but because we have sinned and provoked Him to anger, our adversaries are made our judges.
Deu 32:32  For the works of this people are like those of the people of Sedom, and their thoughts like those of the people of Amorah: their evil works make them desolate, and become bitter to them. 
Deu 32:33  For the poison of this people is like that of serpents what time they drink wine, and their malice like the head of asps and cruel reptiles.
Deu 32:34  Is not this the cup of punishment, mixed and ordained for the wicked, sealed in My treasuries for the day of the great judgment? 
Deu 32:35 Vengeance is mine: I am He who repayeth; in the time when the foot of the righteous is moved; for the day of destruction for the wicked is nigh the fire of Gehinam. is prepared for them, and their punishment girdeth itself to come upon them.
Deu 32:36  For the Lord Himself will adjudge the judgment of the people of the children of Israel, and comfort His righteous servants; for it is manifest before Him that the hand of the righteous will waver, and that they will be forsaken and cast down, with none to help or support them. 
Deu 32:37  For the Gentiles will say, Behold, the God of Israel is strong in whom they put their trust;
Deu 32:38  they brought before Him the fat of their sacrifices, and the wine of their libations; let Him who (once) was over them as a shield rise up now and deliver them.
Deu 32:39  See now that I in My Word am He, and there is no other God beside Me. I kill the living in this world, and make alive the dead in the world that cometh; I am He who smiteth, and I am He who healeth; and there is none who can deliver from My hand.
Deu 32:40  For I have uplifted My hand with an oath to heaven, and said, I live, and My Word subsisteth for ever.
Deu 32:41  If I whet My sword as lightning, My right hand will prevail in judgment. I will render punishment upon the adversaries of My people, I will repay them for their evil deeds.
Deu 32:42  I will make My arrows drunk with their blood, and My sword shall consume their flesh; with the blood of the destroyers of My people, their captives, and the chieftains of their hosts.
Deu 32:43  Let the nations give praise before Him, let the people of Beth Israel glorify Him; for He bath made inquisition for the trouble of His righteous servants, and brought vengeance upon His enemies; for the sins of His people He smote the land; but He will make Atonement for the land, and for His people.
Deu 32:44   And Mosheh came and spake all the praise of the words of this hymn in the hearing of the people, be and Hoshea bar Nun.
Deu 32:45  And Mosheh ended speaking all these words with all Israel,
Deu 32:46  and said to them: Set your heart unto all the words with which I bear witness to you this day, and which you shall teach your children, that they may observe and do all the glorious words of this law.
Deu 32:47  For it is not a vain word to you, because it is your life, and by this word you will multiply days upon the land that you pass over Jordan to inherit.
Deu 32:48 
Deu 32:49 
Deu 32:50 
Deu 32:51 
Deu 32:52  Because you were rebellious towards the Name of My Word, among the Beni Israel, at the Waters of Contention in Rekem in the desert of Zin; forasmuch as you did not sanctify Me in the midst of them, therefore thou mayest look over against it, but shalt not enter into the land which I give to the children of Israel.
Deu 33:1  This is the Benediction wherewith Mosheh the prophet of the Lord blessed the children of Israel before be should be gathered,
Deu 33:2  and he said: The Lord was revealed from Sinai to give the law unto His people of Beth Israel. He arose in His glory upon the mountain of Seir to give the law to the sons of Esau; but after they found that it was written therein, Thou shalt do no murder, they would not receive it. He revealed Himself in His glory oil the mountain of Gebala, to give the law to the sons of Ishmael; but when they found that it was written therein, Ye shall not be thieves, they would not receive it. Again did He reveal Himself upon Mount Sinai, and with Him ten thousands of holy angels; and the children of Israel said, All that the Word of the Lord hath spoken will we perform and obey. And He stretched forth His hand from the midst of the flaming fire, and gave the Law to His people.
Deu 33:3 Is it not all manifest and known before Him, that neither the sons of Esau nor of Ishmael would receive the law? Nevertheless, because He loved His people of Beth Israel as myriads of the holy angels, though He brought upon them many corrections, they rested not, nor desisted from the doctrine of the law; and, behold, they were conducted and brought on at the foot of His Cloud, and went forward and encamped according to His Word.
Deu 33:4 The sons of Israel said, Mosheh commanded us the law: he gave it for an inheritance and possession to the congregation of the house of Jakob.
Deu 33:5   And a king shall arise from the house of Jakob, when the heads of the people are gathered together: unto Him shall the tribes of Israel be obedient.
Deu 33:6  Let Reuben live in this world, nor die the second death which the wicked the in the world to come; and let his youths be with the men in number.
Deu 33:7  And this is the benediction with which Mosheh the prophet blessed the tribe of Jehudah, and he said: May the Word of the Lord hearken to the prayer of Jehudah, and bring him back to his people from battle. May his hand avenge him upon his enemies, and be Thou a help and a support against his foes.
Deu 33:8  And Mosheh the prophet blessed the tribe of Levi, and said: With the Uraia and Tummaia hast thou clothed Aharon the saint, whom Thou didst try, and he was steadfast in the temptation, and whom Thou didst prove at the Waters of Contention in Rekem, and he was found faithful.
Deu 33:9  For of the tribe of Levi it may be said, He respected not the face of his own father and mother in the judgment of Tamar, and knew not his brother in the matter of the (golden) calf, nor towards his own children was he moved with mercy, in the work of Zimri; for they have kept the word of Thy mouth, and have been ready (to fulfil) the decree of Thy law.
Deu 33:10  Apt are they to teach the orders of Thy judgments to them of Beth Jakob, and the decree of Thy law to the congregation of the tribes of Israel. They put the goodly aromatic incense (on the censer) to restrain Thy anger, and offer the perfect sacrifice with acceptance at Thy altar.
Deu 33:11  Bless, Lord, the substance of the tribe of Levi, and receive with favour the oblation of his hand; break Thou the loins of his enemies, that his adversaries may fall, and rise no more.
Deu 33:12  Mosheh the prophet of the Lord blessed the tribe of Benjamin, and said: The beloved of the Lord shall abide with confidence by Him, He will protect him all the days, and within his borders will dwell the glory of the Shekinah of the Lord.
Deu 33:13  And Mosheh the prophet of the Lord blessed the tribe of Joseph, and said: Blessed be the laud of Joseph, before the Lord, with the blessing of the dew and the rain that come down from the heavens above, with the blessings of the fountains of the deep which well up from the earth beneath. 
Deu 33:14  Bounteous produce will it yield from the good provision of the sun; and will ripen its first fruits at the beginning of month and month.
Deu 33:15  It aboundeth in fruitfulness for the righteousness sake of Abraham, Izhak, and Jakob, the holy fathers who are like the mountains, and for the merit of Sarah, Revekah, Rahel, and Leah, the four mothers who are like the hills.
Deu 33:16  It bringeth forth richly from the excellence of the earth and its fulness, and by the good will of Him who caused the glory of His Shekinah to dwell in the bush. Let all these blessings come and be a crown upon the head of Joseph, and upon the brow of the man who ruled in the land of Mizraim, and was the brightness of his brothers glory.
Deu 33:17  The birthright, kingdom, and honour are Joseph's: for as it may not be that one should work with the firstling among cattle, nor bring the horns of the reema into servitude; but as the ox and the reema push with their horns, so this people, the sons of the tribe of Joseph, going out to battle against their enemies, will slaughter kings and princes. Myriads of the Amoraah will be slain by Jehoshua bar Nun, who is of the tribe of the Beni Ephraim; thou­ sands of the Midyanee will be slain by Gideon bar Yoash, who is of the tribe of the Beni Menasheh.
Deu 33:18  Mosheh the prophet of the Lord blessed the tribe of Zebulon, and said: Rejoice, O ye of the house of Zebulon, when you go out upon your commerce; and ye of the house of Issakar, rejoice, when you come in unto your houses of learning.
Deu 33:19  Behold, this people of the house of Zebulon will come up together to the mountain of the sanctuary to offer true oblations; for they eat the revenue of the seas, and the treasures hidden in the sands are disclosed unto them.
Deu 33:20  And Mosheh the prophet of the Lord blessed the tribe of Gad, and said: Blessed is he who hath made wide the border of Gad. He reposeth and inhabiteth as a lion and a lioness; nor will there be any kingdom or people who can stand before him; and when he goeth forth in war against his enemies his slaughtered are known among the slain by the head being cut away unto the arm.
Deu 33:21  And he saw at the beginning that a place had been prepared there for a sepulchre, a place strown with precious stones and pearls, where Mosheh the prophet, the scribe of Israel, was to be hidden, (who) as he went in and out at the head of the people in this world, so will he go in and oat in the world to come; because he wrought righteousness before the Lord, and taught the orders of the judgments to the sons of Israel.
