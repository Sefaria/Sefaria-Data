Parah, Chapter Twelve, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
A clean person may hold in the corner of his garment an unclean axe and sprinkle upon it; 
And even though there is on it enough water for a sprinkling he remains clean. 
How much water is necessary for sprinkling? 
Sufficient for the tops of the buds to be dipped and for the sprinkling to be performed. 
Rabbi Judah ruled: they are regarded as though they were on a hyssop of brass. 

Explanation
Section one: It is possible for a person to hold an axe in his garment, for the axe to be sprinkled upon and for him not to become impure by contact or by carrying the hatat waters. Even though there is enough water to perform the sprinkling, he remains pure because once these waters have purified the axe, their mitzvah has been performed and they no longer defile.
Section two: The question is: how much water is necessary to defile one who carries it? According to the first opinion, as long as there is enough water to dip the top buds of the hyssop into the water and to sprinkle some of the water off of them onto the person or thing being sprinkled upon. This quantity of water will defile one who carries it. In other words, there must be enough so that besides that which is absorbed by the hyssop, other water will be sprinkled off. 
Rabbi Judah rules more stringently. We look at the buds as if they were on hyssop made of brass which doesn't absorb water. As long as there is enough to sprinkle some off of the brass, it is of a sufficient amount to defile. This will be a lower amount than the first opinion.
