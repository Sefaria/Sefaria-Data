Parah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Our mishnah continues the description of the ritual of the burning of the cow.

Mishnah Eight
They laid their hands upon him and said, "My Lord the high priest, perform immersion once." 
He went down and immersed himself and came up and dried himself. 
Different kinds of wood were set in order there: cedar wood, pine, spruce and the wood of smooth fig trees. 
They made it in the shape of a tower and opened air holes in it; and its foreside was turned towards the west.

Explanation
Section one: The elders lay their hands on the high priest, telling him to go immerse to prepare for the burning of the red cow. Two notes are in order. 1) This is again similar to the Yom Kippur ritual (see 1:3). 2) This ceremony need not be performed by the high priest. It seems that by according it to him, the ceremony received greater prominence.
Section two: He needed to immerse because they had intentionally defiled him.
Section three: The wood was set to burn the cow. It was made into a tower with air holes so that it would burn more effectively. The wood was set up facing the Temple (which was to the west), meaning it was in rows going from west to east, with the front of the wood towards the west.
