Parah, Chapter Five, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
A reed pipe that was cut [for use as a container] for the hatat: 
Rabbi Eliezer says: it must be immersed immediately. 
Rabbi Joshua ruled: he defiles it and then immerses it. 
All are eligible to prepare the mixture, except a deaf mute, an imbecile and a minor. 
Rabbi Judah says a minor is eligible, but disqualifies a woman and a hermaphrodite. 

Explanation
Section one: A reed pipe was cut and made into a vessel usable for holding water (on reed pipes as vessels see Kelim 17, the end of the chapter). Rabbi Eliezer says that it is to be immersed immediately for the sake of a hatat.
Rabbi Joshua says that it should first be intentionally defiled and then it can be immersed and used immediately. This way the reed pipe will have the status of "tvul yom"—something that is clean but has not yet waited for the sun set. As we saw in 3:7, the rabbis wanted the red cow ritual to be performed by a tvul yom as part of their polemic against the Sadducees who believed that a person was not pure until after the sun had set.
Section two: Anyone, even a non-priest and even a woman, can take the ashes and put them in the water. Numbers 19:9 says that a pure person must collect the ash. The rabbis take this to mean that the person needs to be pure, but that it can be done by anyone. However, he must have "awareness"—meaning the ability to comprehend what he is doing. As we have seen many times throughout the Mishnah, the rabbis considered the deaf mute, the imbecile and the minor to be incapable of such awareness. 
Rabbi Judah says that a minor is capable of putting the ash into the water, but a woman is not allowed to do so. Similarly, a hermaphrodite who is part man/part woman, cannot perform the mixing of the ash and water.
