Parah, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
Whatever causes terumah to be invalid causes liquid to become unclean in the first grade so that it can convey uncleanness at one remove, and render unfit at one other remove, except for a tevul yom. 
Behold [the food] would say [to the liquid], "That which defiled you did not defile me, but you did defile me."

Explanation
Section one: Something that has second degree impurity, meaning it came into contact with something that had first degree impurity, invalidates terumah such that the terumah cannot be consumed. If such a substance comes into contact with liquid, it conveys to the liquid first degree impurity. As we have seen before, liquid amplifies the power of impurity. 
If such liquid comes into contact with food it gives second degree impurity to the food. This is "one remove." And if the food comes into contact with terumah it renders the terumah unfit, although it does not render it impure. 
The one exception is the "tevul yom" a person who has immersed in the mikveh to cleanse his impurity but hasn't waited for the sun to set. Such a person disqualifies terumah, but does not convey first degree impurity to liquids.
Section two: The food now says to the liquid. That which defiled you (that which had second degree impurity) could not defile me (things with second degree impurity only defile liquids). But you (liquid) did defile me (because liquid can defile food).
