Parah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Four

Introduction
If one intends to drink the red cow waters, he invalidates them. Our mishnah discusses at what point they become invalid.

Mishnah Four 
If one intended to drink the hatat water: 
Rabbi Eliezer says: it becomes invalid. 
Rabbi Joshua says: only when one tips the flask. 
Rabbi Yose said: To what does this apply? To water that had not yet been prepared, 
But in the case of water that had been prepared:
Rabbi Eliezer says: it becomes invalid [only] when one tips the flask; 
And Rabbi Joshua says: [only] when one drinks. 
And if it was poured directly into one's throat, it remains valid. 

Explanation
Section one: According to Rabbi Eliezer, intent alone disqualifies the water. So if one intends to drink it, it is already invalid. Rabbi Joshua says that while one does not have to actually drink the water to disqualify it, one must at least perform some action. Tipping the flask to take a drink is sufficient of an action to disqualify the water.
Section two: Rabbi Yose limits this to water that has not yet been prepared, meaning the ashes have not yet been mixed in. If the ashes have been mixed in, then each sage rules slightly more leniently. Rabbi Eliezer says he must tip the water to disqualify it, whereas Rabbi Joshua says that intent alone does not disqualify waters that have already been prepared. They are disqualified only if he actually drinks them. 
Section three: If someone else pours the water directly into a another person's mouth then the waters remain valid (those that have not been drunk, of course). This is because no one had any intent to drink the water and no spit went in, because the water was poured down his throat. Therefore, there is no reason to invalidate the water.
