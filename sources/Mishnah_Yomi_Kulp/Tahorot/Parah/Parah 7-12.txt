Parah, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Twelve

Mishnah Twelve
One who broke down a fence [even] with the intention of putting it up again, the water remains valid; 
But if he put a fence up, the water becomes invalid. 
If he ate figs intending to store some of them, the water is valid; 
But if he stored figs it is invalid. 
If he was eating figs and, leaving some over, threw what was in his hand under the fig tree or among drying figs in order that it shall not be wasted, the water is invalid.

Explanation
Section one: The person broke down a fence to get to where he needed to go after filling up the water. Breaking down the fence obviously does not invalidate the water for it was done in order to put up the fence. 
The mishnah goes a bit further. Even if he intends to put up the fence again, the water is still valid. Although we might have thought that tearing something down in order to rebuild it does count as work, since he needed to tear down the fence, the water is still valid. 
However, if he went even a step further and actually built the fence, this certainly counts as work and the water is invalid.
Section two: If someone eats someone else's figs in between filling and mixing the water, and he intends to repay that person by preparing the other figs for storage (this involves cutting them in order to dry them or press them into a cake) the water is still valid, for eating is considered something done for the mixture itself. The quid pro quo arrangementâ€”eating figs in return for drying them, does not count as work. 
However, if he actually went ahead and stored some figs in between drawing and mixing, the water is invalid.
Section three: In this case he is eating and storing them away for later at the same time. Although eating doesn't invalidate the figs, the storing does.
