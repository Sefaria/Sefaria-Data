Parah, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
One who filled the water with one hand and did some other work with the other hand, or filled the water for himself and for another man, or filled two jars at the same time, the water of both is invalid, for work causes invalidity whether one acts for oneself or for another person.

Explanation
In all of these cases a person is engaged in some sort of work while he is occupied with filling water for the red cow ritual. Either he works with one hand while filling with the other, or fills for himself and another person at the same time, or fills two at the same time. In all cases, all of the water is invalid for as we have learned, one can't perform work and fill the water at the same time.
The general rule is that when one is filling the water and he at the same time does work, the water is invalid not just for him, but even if he is doing it on behalf of another person. This is not true when it comes to mixing, as we saw in mishnah one.
