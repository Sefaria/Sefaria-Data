Parah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
If the ashes floated on the water: 
Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon rule: one may take some of them and use them in another preparation; 
But the sages say: with any ashes that have touched water no other mixture may be prepared from them. 
If he emptied out the water and some ashes were found at the bottom: 
Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon rule: one may dry them and then use them for another preparation; 
But the sages rule: with any ashes that have touched water no other mixture may be prepared.  

Explanation
Section one: According to Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon if there are some ashes that are floating on the water after he has mixed them in, one can take those ashes and reuse them with other water to make more hatat waters. Think of it as red cow recycling. The other sages say that after the process has been performed once with some ashes, it cannot be performed again with the same ashes. 
Section two: This is basically the same dispute as in section one, except here ashes have settled to the bottom of the vessel into which they were mixed.
