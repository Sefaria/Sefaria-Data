Parah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
If valid ashes were mixed up with wood ashes, we follow the majority with regard to uncleanness, but [the mixture] may not be prepared with it. 
Rabbi Eliezer says: the mixture may be prepared with all of them.

Explanation
Section one: The wood ashes are regular wood ashes that were not burned with the red cow. If the valid red cow ashes are mixed up with them, then when it comes to the ability of these ashes to convey impurity, we follow a majority principle. If a majority is red cow ash, it conveys impurity. 
However, the first opinion of the mishnah holds that this mixture cannot be used for the red cow ritual. 
Section two: Rabbi Eliezer is lenient, as he was in mishnah one. Since we know that there is some red cow ash in the entire mixture, it can be used in the ritual.
