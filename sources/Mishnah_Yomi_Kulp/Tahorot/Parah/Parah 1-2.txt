Parah, Chapter One, Mishnah Two

Introduction
There are many occasions when the Torah mandates sacrificing a "par" or a bull. In today's mishnah there are three opinions as to how old the bull must be.

Mishnah Two
Rabbi Yose the Galilean said: bulls must be no more than two years old, for it is said, "And the second bull you shall take for a sin-offering" (Numbers 8:8). 
But the sages say: they may be even three years old. 
Rabbi Meir says: even those that are four or five years old are valid, but old animals are not brought out of respect.

Explanation
Section one: Rabbi Yose the Galilean bases his halakhah on a midrash on Numbers 8:8. The verse says that one should take the "second bull." Since the Torah states elsewhere said to take two bulls and one has already been sacrificed why does it need to say "second." From this "extraneous" word Rabbi Yose the Galilean concludes that the word "second" refers to how old the bull must beâ€”two years.
Section two: The sages say that the bull can even be three years old. There are some versions that don't include the word "even." According to this, the rabbis hold that it must be three years old.
Section three: Rabbi Meir again provides a much higher limit for the age of the animal being discussed (as he did in yesterday's mishnah). However, despite the fact that one can bring a relatively old animal, it is not respectful to do so because it looks as if he is offering this animal only because it will die soon anyway.
