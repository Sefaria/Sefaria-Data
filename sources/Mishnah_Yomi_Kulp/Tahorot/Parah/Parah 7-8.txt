Parah, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight
One who puts the jar away in order that it shall not be broken, or if he inverted it in order to dry it,
[If he did one of these things] so that he might draw more water with it, [the water he had already drawn] is valid; 
But if he intended to carry in it the ashes, it is invalid. 
One who cleared potsherds from a trough:
If in order that it may hold more water, the water is valid; 
But if he intended that they should not hinder him when he pours out the water, it is invalid.  

Explanation
Section one: There are two actions described here, each that can invalidate the water if they were done with a certain intention, but won't invalidate the water if done with another intention. The actions are both done for the sake of the jar—either to protect it or to dry it—and they are both done between the emptying of the water into a trough and the mixing of the water with the ashes.
If he did one of these things with the intention to draw more water for the same mixture, then this is not "work" done in between filling and mixing and the water remains valid for use. However, if he is protecting or drying the jar to use it for any other purpose, even a purpose connected to the mixing of the ashes, such as carrying in it the ashes, the water is invalid.
Section two: The idea of this section is similar to that above. Someone clears potsherds from the trough into which he has put the water to use it for mixing the ashes. If he clears them in order to make more room in the trough, the water is valid. However, if he is removing them because he doesn't want them to bother him when he pours the mixture from the trough into a flask (from which he will sprinkle) then this action counts as work and it invalidates the mixture. Again, although this is done for the sake of the mixture, it still invalidates it.
