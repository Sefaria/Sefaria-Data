Parah, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
A jar of hatat waters that touched a [dead] sheretz, remains clean. 
If the jar was put on it: 
Rabbi Eliezer rules that it remains clean, 
And the sages rule that it becomes unclean. 
If the jar touched foods or liquids or the Holy Scriptures, it remains clean. 
If it was put on them:
Rabbi Yose rules that it remains clean; 
And the sages say that it becomes unclean. 

Explanation
Section one: The jar referred to here is made of a material that is not susceptible to impurity, such as stone (see 3:3). The hatat waters are protected from the impurity of the sheretz (a creeping thing) by the stone and therefore they remain pure. 
Section two: Rabbi Eliezer says that even if the jar is put on top of a sheretz the hatat waters remain pure, since the jar is pure. 
The other sages say that the jar has not been put in a "clean place" and therefore it is impure. Numbers 19:9 states, "A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the cow and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place." Putting the jar on top of a sheretz does not count as putting it in a clean place. 
Section three: As we have seen in the previous two mishnayot, food and liquids convey madaf uncleanness. The Holy Scriptures disqualify terumah if they come into contact with it. Nevertheless, since the jar is made of stone, the contents are protected. 
Section four: Rabbi Yose holds that even if the jar is put on top of food, liquids or the Holy Scriptures it remains pure. He also holds that the sages that ruled in section two that the jar was impure, would agree in this case because the impurity conveyed by food, liquids and the Holy Scriptures is only of rabbinic origin. In contrast, the impurity conveyed by a sheretz is of toraitic origin. 
The other sages disagree with Rabbi Yose and hold that putting it on top of one of these things still doesn't count as putting it in a pure place.
