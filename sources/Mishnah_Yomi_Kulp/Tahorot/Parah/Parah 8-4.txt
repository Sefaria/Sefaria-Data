Parah, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Four

Introduction
The next four mishnayot have nothing to do with the red cow. They are all here because they contain the line, "Behold, that which defiled you did not defile me, but you did defile me." 

Mishnah Four
One that eats of the carrion of a clean bird, while it is yet in his throat, causes garments to be unclean; 
But the carrion itself does not cause garments to be unclean. 
Behold [the garment] would say [to the person], "That which defiled you did not defile me, but you did defile me.  

Explanation
Section one: One who eats carrion (an animal that wasn't slaughtered properly) of a clean bird (like a chicken) is impure. This is stated in Leviticus 17:15. The impurity occurs as soon as the bite he took reaches his throat. We will learn more of the details concerning this law in Tractate Toharot. 
Section two: The carrion itself does not cause impurity. 
Section three: This is the same personification we have seen in the other mishnayot.
