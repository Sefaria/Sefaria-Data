Parah, Chapter Five, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight
If there were two troughs in one stone and the mixture was prepared in one of them, the water in the other is not prepared. 
If a hole of the size of the spout of a water skin passed from one to the other, or if the water overflowed both, even if only [to a depth of] the thickness of garlic peel, and the mixture was prepared in one of them, the water in the other is also prepared.

Explanation
Section one: In this situation there are two troughs set into the stone, neither of which are attached to the ground and therefore both can count as vessels (see yesterday's mishnah). If the mixture of red cow ashes and water is prepared in one, the water in the other is not considered to have been prepared because the two troughs are not connected. 
Section two: However, if there is a connection between the two, either through a hole or by causing the water to overflow from one into the other, then as soon as one is prepared, the other is prepared as well.
