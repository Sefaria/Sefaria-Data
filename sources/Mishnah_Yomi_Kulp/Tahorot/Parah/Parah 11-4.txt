Parah, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
All that require immersion in water according to the rulings of the Torah defile consecrated things, terumah, unconsecrated food, and [second] tithe; 
And he is forbidden to enter the sanctuary. 
After immersion [but before the sun sets] he defiles holy things and invalidates terumah, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
But the sages ruled: he invalidates consecrated things and terumah.
But he is permitted to unconsecrated food and [second] tithe.
And if he entered the sanctuary, whether before or after his immersion, he incurs guilt. 

Explanation
Section one: A person who has been defiled by a "father of impurity" requires immersion in a mikveh. See for instance Leviticus 11:32 with regard to one who has had contact with a sheretz. Such a person defiles any food with which he has had contact, be it consecrated food (kodesh), terumah, unconsecrated food (hullin) or second tithe. 
He is also forbidden from entering the sanctuary (the Temple.)
Section two: According to Rabbi Meir, after he has immersed in the mikveh, the person has the status of "second degree defilement." He causes terumah to have third decree impurity, which causes it to be invalid but not impure. And he causes holy things to have fourth degree impurity.
The other sages say that since he has immersed in the mikveh he does not defile even holy things. He merely invalidates both holy things and terumah.
After having immersed in the mikveh, he causes no defilement or invalidation to common food or to second tithe. 
However, when it comes to entering the sanctuary, he is prohibited even after going to the mikveh. He can't enter the sanctuary until he has immersed in the mikveh and the sun has set.
