Mishnah . If the hyssop was dipped in the daytime and the sprinkling also was done on the same day, it is valid. If one dipped it in the daytime and sprinkled at night, or dipped at night and sprinkled on the following day, (or dipped in the daytime and sprinkled on the following day), the sprinkling is invalid. [the man himself], however, may perform immersion at night and do the sprinkling on the following day, for sprinkling is not allowed until the sun is risen; yet if any of these was done as early as the rise of dawn it is valid.

MISHNAH 1. THIRTEEN RULINGS GOVERN THE CARRION OF A CLEAN BIRD: THERE
MUST BE1 INTENTION2 BUT3 IT NEED NOT BE RENDERED SUSCEPTIBLE;4 IT CONVEYS
FOOD UNCLEANNESS5 IF ITS MINIMUM BULK IS THAT OF AN EGG; AND IT CONVEYS
UNCLEANNESS6 WHEN IN ONE'S GULLET7 IF ITS MINIMUM BULK IS THAT OF AN
OLIVE; HE THAT EATS OF IT MUST WAIT8 UNTIL SUNSET;9 GUILT IS INCURRED ON
ACCOUNT OF IT FOR ENTERING THE SANCTUARY;10 TERUMAH IS BURNT ON
ACCOUNT OF IT;11 HE WHO EATS A MEMBER OF IT WHILE IT IS ALIVE MUST SUFFER
THE PENALTY OF FORTY STRIPES;12 SLAUGHTERING IT13 OR WRINGING ITS NECK14
FREES IT FROM UNCLEANNESS EVEN WHEN IT IS TREFA.15 SO R. MEIR.16 R. JUDAH
RULED: THEY DO NOT FREE IT FROM UNCLEANNESS. R. JOSE RULED: THE
SLAUGHTERING13 DOES FREE IT FROM THE UNCLEANNESS BUT THE WRINGING OF
ITS NECK14 DOES NOT.
MISHNAH 2. THE LARGE FEATHERS17 AND THE DOWN18 CONTRACT
UNCLEANNESS,19 AND20 CONVEY UNCLEANNESS21 BUT DO NOT COMBINE [WITH THE
FLESH TO CONSTITUTE THE PRESCRIBED MINIMUM].22 R. ISHMAEL RULED: THE
DOWN DOES COMBINE [WITH THE FLESH]. THE BEAK23 AND THE CLAWS24
CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS19 AND20 CONVEY UNCLEANNESS AND ALSO
COMBINE[WITH THE FLESH TO CONSTITUTE THE PRESCRIBED MINIMUM].22 R.JOSE
RULED: ALSO THE ENDS25 OF THE WINGS AND THE END25 OF THE TAIL COMBINE
[WITH THE FLESH TO CONSTITUTE THE MINIMUM].22 SINCE THEY ARE LEFT
UNPLUCKED ON FATTENED BIRDS.26
MISHNAH 3. THE CARRION OF AN UNCLEAN BIRD NECESSITATES27 INTENTION28
AND27 IT MUST BE RENDERED SUSCEPTIBLE;29 IT CONVEYS FOOD UNCLEANNESS30 IF
ITS MINIMUM BULK31 IS THAT OF AN EGG; THE CONSUMPTION OF A HALF OF HALF A
LOAF'S BULK32 OF IT33 RENDERS ONE'S PERSON UNFIT TO EAT TERUMAH;34 AN
OLIVE'S BULK OF IT IN ONE'S GULLET CONVEYS NO UNCLEANNESS; HE WHO EATS
OF IT NEED NOT WAIT FOR SUNSET;35 NO GUILT IS INCURRED ON ACCOUNT OF IT36
FOR ENTERING THE SANCTUARY;37 BUT ON ACCOUNT OF IT36 TERUMAH38 MUST BE
BURNT; HE WHO EATS A MEMBER OF IT WHILE IT IS ALIVE IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE
PENALTY OF FORTY STRIPES,39 BUT SLAUGHTERING IT DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY40
RENDER IT FIT.41 THE LARGE FEATHERS AND THE DOWN CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS
AND CONVEY UNCLEANNESS AND COMBINE WITH THE FLESH TO CONSTITUTE THE
PRESCRIBED MINIMUM. THE BEAK AND THE CLAWS CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS AND
CONVEY UNCLEANNESS AND COMBINE [WITH THE FLESH TO MAKE UP THE
PRESCRIBED MINIMUM].
MISHNAH 4. IN THE CASE OF CATTLE, THE HIDE, GREASE, SEDIMENT,FLAYED-OFF
FLESH, BONES, SINEWS, HORNS AND HOOFS COMBINE42 [WITH THE FLESH] TO
CONVEY FOOD UNCLEANNESS43 BUT NOT TO CONVEY CARRION UNCLEANNESS.44
SIMILARLY, IF A MAN45 SLAUGHTERED AN UNCLEAN BEAST FOR AN IDOLATER AND
IT WAS STILL JERKING ITS LIMBS,46 IT CONVEYS FOOD UNCLEANNESS;47 BUT IT
CONVEYS NO CARRION UNCLEANNESS UNTIL IT IS DEAD OR ITS HEAD IS CHOPPED
OFF.48 [SCRIPTURE THUS] LAID DOWN MORE RESTRICTIONS IN REGARD TO THE
CONVEYANCE OF FOOD UNCLEANNESS THAN IN REGARD TO THE CONVEYANCE OF
CARRION UNCLEANNESS.
MISHNAH 5. A FOODSTUFF THAT CONTRACTED UNCLEANNESS FROM A ‘FATHER
OF UNCLEANNESS’ AND ONE THAT CONTRACTED UNCLEANNESS FROM A DERIVED
UNCLEANNESS49 MAY BE COMBINED TOGETHER50 TO CONVEY UNCLEANNESS
ACCORDING TO THE LIGHTER GRADE OF THE TWO.HOW SO? IF THE BULK OF HALF
AN EGG OF FOOD OF A FIRST GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS AND THE BULK OF HALF AN
EGG OF FOOD OF A SECOND GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS WERE MIXED TOGETHER, THE
TWO51 ARE REGARDED AS SUFFERING ONLY SECOND GRADE UNCLEANNESS;52 AND
IF THE BULK OF HALF AN EGG OF FOOD OF A SECOND GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS
AND THE BULK OF HALF AN EGG OF FOOD OF A THIRD GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS
WERE MIXED TOGETHER, THE TWO51 ARE REGARDED AS SUFFERING ONLY THIRD
GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS.53 IF THE BULK OF AN EGG OF FOOD OF A FIRST GRADE OF
UNCLEANNESS AND THE BULK OF AN EGG OF FOOD OF A SECOND GRADE OF
UNCLEANNESS WERE MIXED TOGETHER, BOTH51 ARE REGARDED54 AS SUFFERING
FIRST GRADE UNCLEANNESS;55 BUT IF THEY WERE THEN DIVIDED, EACH PART56 IS
REGARDED AS SUFFERING ONLY A SECOND GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS.57 IF EACH
PART58 SEPARATELY FELL ON A LOAF OF TERUMAH, THEY CAUSE IT TO BECOME
UNFIT,59 BUT IF THE TWO FELL TOGETHER THEY CAUSE IT TO SUFFER SECOND
GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS.
MISHNAH 6. THE BULK OF AN EGG OF FOOD OF A SECOND GRADE OF
UNCLEANNESS AND THE BULK OF AN EGG OF FOOD OF A THIRD GRADE OF
UNCLEANNESS THAT WERE MIXED TOGETHER ARE51 REGARDED AS SUFFERING
SECOND GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS.60 IF THEY WERE THEN DIVIDED, EACH PART61 IS
REGARDED AS SUFFERING ONLY THIRD GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS.62 IF EACH PART
SEPARATELY FELL ON A LOAF OF TERUMAH THEY DO NOT RENDER IT INVALID,63
BUT IF THE TWO FELL TOGETHER THEY CAUSE IT TO SUFFER THIRD GRADE OF
UNCLEANNESS. THE BULK OF AN EGG OF FOOD OF A FIRST GRADE OF
UNCLEANNESS AND THE BULK OF AN EGG OF FOOD OF A THIRD GRADE OF
UNCLEANNESS THAT WERE MIXED TOGETHER ARE64 REGARDED AS SUFFERING
FIRST GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS,65 BUT IF THEY WERE THEN DIVIDED, EACH PART IS
REGARDED AS SUFFERING ONLY SECOND GRADE UNCLEANNESS,60 FOR EVEN THE
THIRD GRADE THAT TOUCHED THE FIRST HAS BECOME ONLY A SECOND GRADE. IF
THE BULK OF TWO EGGS OF FOOD OF THE FIRST GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS AND THE
BULK OF TWO EGGS OF FOOD OF THE SECOND GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS WERE
MIXED TOGETHER THEY ARE REGARDED AS SUFFERING FIRST GRADE OF
UNCLEANNESS. IF THEY WERE THEN DIVIDED, EACH PART IS STILL REGARDED AS
SUFFERING FIRST GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS. BUT IF THEY WERE DIVIDED INTO
THREE OR FOUR PARTS, EACH IS REGARDED AS SUFFERING FROM SECOND GRADE.
IF THE BULK OF TWO EGGS OF FOOD OF THE SECOND GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS AND
THE BULK OF TWO EGGS OF FOOD OF THE THIRD GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS WERE
MIXED TOGETHER, THEY ARE REGARDED AS SUFFERING SECOND GRADE OF
UNCLEANNESS. IF THEY WERE THEN DIVIDED, EACH PART IS STILL REGARDED AS
SUFFERING SECOND GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS. BUT IF THEY WERE DIVIDED INTO
THREE OR FOUR PARTS, EACH IS REGARDED AS SUFFERING ONLY THIRD GRADE OF
UNCLEANNESS.
MISHNAH 7. IF PIECES OF DOUGH66 CLUNG TO EACH OTHER67 OR IF LOAVES
ADHERED TO EACH OTHER,68 AND ONE OF THEM CONTRACTED UNCLEANNESS
FROM A [DEAD] CREEPING THING,69 THEY ALL BECOME UNCLEAN IN THE FIRST
GRADE;70 AND IF THEY WERE THEN SEPARATED THEY ARE STILL REGARDED AS
SUFFERING FIRST GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS. IF ONE OF THEM CONTRACTED
UNCLEANNESS FROM A LIQUID71 THEY ALL SUFFER SECOND GRADE OF
UNCLEANNESS;70 AND IF THEY WERE THEN SEPARATED THEY ARE STILL REGARDED
AS SUFFERING SECOND GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS. IF ONE OF THEM CONTRACTEDUNCLEANNESS FROM THE HANDS,72 THEY ALL BECOME UNCLEAN IN THE THIRD
GRADE; AND IF THEY WERE THEN SEPARATED THEY ARE STILL REGARDED AS
SUFFERING THIRD GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS.
MISHNAH 8. IF TO A PIECE OF DOUGH73 THAT WAS SUFFERING FIRST GRADE OF
UNCLEANNESS OTHERS WERE MADE TO ADHERE,67 THEY ALL BECOME UNCLEAN IN
THE FIRST GRADE;70 AND IF IT WAS SEPARATED, IT STILL REMAINS UNCLEAN IN THE
FIRST GRADE BUT ALL THE OTHERS ARE REGARDED AS SUFFERING ONLY SECOND
GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS.74 IF TO A PIECE OF DOUGH73 THAT WAS SUFFERING
SECOND GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS OTHERS WERE MADE TO ADHERE,67 THEY ALL
BECOME UNCLEAN IN THE SECOND GRADE;70 AND IF IT WAS SEPARATED, IT STILL
REMAINS UNCLEAN IN THE SECOND GRADE BUT ALL THE OTHERS ARE ONLY
UNCLEAN IN THE THIRD GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS. IF TO A PIECE73 THAT WAS
UNCLEAN IN THE THIRD GRADE OTHERS WERE MADE TO ADHERE,67 IT REMAINS
UNCLEAN IN THE THIRD GRADE BUT ALL THE OTHERS REMAIN CLEAN,75
IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THEY WERE SUBSEQUENTLY SEPARATED FROM IT OR
WHETHER THEY WERE NOT SEPARATED.
MISHNAH 9. IF OF HOLY LOAVES76 IN WHOSE HOLLOWS THERE WAS HOLY
WATER77 ONE CONTRACTED UNCLEANNESS FROM A [DEAD]CREEPING THING, THEY
ALL BECOME UNCLEAN.78 IN THE CASE OF LOAVES OF TERUMAH,79 UNCLEANNESS
IS CONVEYED TO TWO LOAVES80 AND INVALIDITY TO ONE.81 IF THERE WAS
DRIPPING LIQUID BETWEEN THEM,82 EVEN IN THE CASE OF TERUMAH ALL82
BECOME UNCLEAN.8
Mishna - Mas. Taharoth Chapter 2
MISHNAH 1. IF A WOMAN WHO1 WAS PRESERVING VEGETABLES2 IN A POT
TOUCHED3 A PROJECTING LEAF OUTSIDE THE POT ON A DRY SPOT,4 EVEN THOUGH
THERE WAS AN EGG'S BULK5 IN THE LEAF,6 IT ALONE BECOMES UNCLEAN7 WHILE
ALL THE REST8 REMAINS CLEAN.9 IF SHE TOUCHED IT10 AT A WET SPOT11 AND
THERE WAS AN EGG'S BULK5 IN THE LEAF,6 ALL12 BECOMES UNCLEAN.13 IF THERE
WAS NOT AN EGG'S BULK5 IN IT,14 IT ALONE BECOMES UNCLEAN BUT ALL THE REST
REMAINS CLEAN. IF IT IS RETURNED INTO THE POT, ALL15 BECOMES UNCLEAN.16 IF
THE WOMAN WAS UNCLEAN17 OWING TO CONTACT WITH ONE WHO CONTRACTED
CORPSE UNCLEANNESS,18 AND SHE TOUCHED THE LEAF EITHER AT A WET SPOT OR
AT A DRY SPOT, ALL19 BECOMES UNCLEAN IF THERE WAS AN EGG'S BULK IN THE
LEAF;20 BUT IF THERE WAS NOT AN EGG'S BULK21 IN IT, IT ALONE BECOMES
UNCLEAN AND ALL THE REST REMAINS CLEAN. IF A WOMAN WHO WAS A
TEBULATH YOM22 EMPTIED OUT THE POT WITH UNWASHED23 HANDS,24 AND SHE
OBSERVED SOME LIQUID ON HER HANDS, AND IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER IT WAS
SPLASHED FROM THE POT OR WHETHER A STALK25 HAD TOUCHED HER HANDS, THE
VEGETABLES ARE INVALID26 BUT THE POT REMAINS CLEAN.27
MISHNAH 2. R. ELIEZER RULED: HE WHO EATS FOOD OF FIRST[GRADE
UNCLEANNESS28 CONTRACTS] FIRST [GRADE UNCLEANNESS];[HE WHO EATS FOOD
OF] SECOND [GRADE UNCLEANNESS28 CONTRACTS] SECOND [GRADE
UNCLEANNESS]; [IF IT WAS] THIRD[GRADE UNCLEANNESS HE CONTRACTS] THIRD
[GRADE UNCLEANNESS]. R. JOSHUA RULED: HE WHO EATS FOOD OF FIRST[GRADE]
OR OF SECOND [GRADE UNCLEANNESS CONTRACTS]SECOND [GRADEUNCLEANNESS]; [IF IT WAS] THIRD [GRADE UNCLEANNESS, HE CONTRACTS]
SECOND [GRADE UNCLEANNESS] IN REGARD TO HOLY THINGS29 BUT NOT IN
REGARD TO TERUMAH.30 ALL THIS APPLIES TO COMMON FOODSTUFFS THAT WERE
PREPARED IN CONDITION OF CLEANNESS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR TERUMAH.31
MISHNAH 3. FIRST [GRADE UNCLEANNESS] IN COMMON FOOD IS UNCLEAN AND
CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS;32 SECOND [GRADE UNCLEANNESS33 ] CONVEYS
INVALIDITY34 BUT DOES NOT CONVEY UNCLEANNESS;35 AND THIRD [GRADE
UNCLEANNESS]36 MAY BE EATEN IN A DISH MIXED WITH TERUMAH.37
MISHNAH 4. FIRST [GRADE] AND SECOND [GRADE UNCLEANNESS] IN TERUMAH
ARE UNCLEAN AND CONVEY UNCLEANNESS;38 THIRD[GRADE UNCLEANNESS]39
CAUSES INVALIDITY40 BUT CONVEYS NO UNCLEANNESS; AND THE FOURTH [GRADE
UNCLEANNESS]41 MAY BE EATEN IN A DISH CONTAINING HOLY FOOD.42
MISHNAH 5. FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD [GRADES OF UNCLEANNESS]IN HOLY
FOODSTUFFS ARE UNCLEAN AND CONVEY UNCLEANNESS;40 THE FOURTH [GRADE
OF UNCLEANNESS] IS INVALID43 AND CAUSES NO UNCLEANNESS; AND THE FIFTH
[GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS]44 MAY BE EATEN IN A DISH CONTAINING CONSECRATED
FOOD.
MISHNAH 6. SECOND [GRADE UNCLEANNESS] IN COMMON FOOD CONVEYS
UNCLEANNESS TO UNCONSECRATED LIQUIDS45 AND CAUSES INVALIDITY TO
FOODSTUFFS OF TERUMAH.THIRD [GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS] IN TERUMAH
CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS TO CONSECRATED LIQUIDS45 AND CAUSES INVALIDITY TO
HOLY FOODSTUFFS IF IT46 WAS PREPARED IN CONDITIONS OF CLEANNESS
APPROPRIATE TO HOLY FOOD; BUT IF IT WAS ONLY PREPARED UNDER CONDITIONS
OF CLEANNESS APPROPRIATE TO TERUMAH, IT CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS AT A FIRST
AND AT A SECOND REMOVE, AND CAUSES INVALIDITY TO HOLY FOOD AT ONE
ADDITIONAL REMOVE.47
MISHNAH 7. R. ELIEZER OBSERVED: THE THREE OF THEM48 ARE ON A PAR IN THE
FOLLOWING CASES. THE FIRST GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS IN HOLY FOOD, IN
TERUMAH OR IN COMMON FOOD CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS AT TWO REMOVES49 AND
CAUSES INVALIDITY AT ONE ADDITIONAL REMOVES IN THE CASE OF HOLY FOOD; IT
CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS AT ONE REMOVE50 AND CAUSES INVALIDITY AT ONE
ADDITIONAL REMOVE47 IN THE CASE OF TERUMAH; AND IN COMMON FOOD IT ONLY
CAUSES INVALIDITY.THE SECOND [GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS] IN THE CASE OF ALL
OF THEM48 CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS AT ONE REMOVE47 AND CAUSES INVALIDITY
AT ONE ADDITIONAL REMOVE51 AS REGARDS HOLY FOOD; IT CONVEYS
UNCLEANNESS TO COMMON LIQUIDS45 AND CAUSES THE INVALIDITY OF
FOODSTUFFS OF TERUMAH. THE THIRD GRADE [OF UNCLEANNESS] IN THE CASE OF
ALL THESE52 CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS TO HOLY LIQUIDS53 AND CAUSES
INVALIDITY TO HOLY FOODSTUFFS.
MISHNAH 8. IF A MAN EATS FOOD OF A SECOND [GRADE OF UNCLEANNESS52 HE
MUST NOT WORK IN AN OLIVE-PRESS.54 COMMON FOODSTUFFS THAT WERE
PREPARED UNDER CONDITIONS PROPER TO THE CLEANNESS OF CONSECRATED
FOOD ARE STILL REGARDED AS COMMON FOOD.55 R. ELIEZER SON OF R. ZADOK
RULED: THEY ARE REGARDED AS TERUMAH TO CONVEY UNCLEANNESS AT TWO
REMOVES56 AND TO RENDER TERUMAH INVALID AT ONE ADDITIONAL REMOVE.57
Mishna - Mas. Taharoth Chapter 3
MISHNAH 1. GREASE, BEAN-MASH AND MILK,1 WHEN IN A CONDITION OF FLUIDITY,2
ARE3 UNCLEAN IN THE FIRST GRADE. IF4 THEY TURNED SOLID THEY5 BECOME
UNCLEAN IN THE SECOND GRADE. IF THEY AGAIN TURNED INTO FLUIDITY THEY
ARE CLEAN IF THEIR BULK WAS EXACTLY THAT OF AN EGG;6 BUT IF IT WAS MORE
THAN THE BULK OF AN EGG THEY REMAIN UNCLEAN, FOR AS SOON AS THE FIRST
DROP ISSUED FORTH IT BECAME UNCLEAN BY CONTACT WITH AN EGG'S BULK.7
MISHNAH 2. R. MEIR RULED: OIL1 ALWAYS8 REMAINS UNCLEAN IN THE FIRST
GRADE;9 AND THE SAGES RULED: HONEY ALSO.9 R. SIMEON OF SHEZUR RULED:
ALSO WINE.9 IF A MASS OF OLIVES1 FELL INTO AN OVEN THAT WAS HEATED10 THE
LATTER REMAINS CLEAN IF THE BULK OF THE OLIVES WAS EXACTLY THAT OF AN
EGG;11 BUT IF IT WAS MORE THAN THAT OF AN EGG THE OVEN BECOMES
UNCLEAN,12 FOR SO SOON AS THE FIRST DROP ISSUED FORTH IT BECAME UNCLEAN
BY CONTACT WITH AN EGG'S BULK. IF THE OLIVES WERE SEPARATED THE OVEN
REMAINS CLEAN EVEN IF THERE WAS A SE'AH OF THEM.13
MISHNAH 3. IF A MAN WHO CONTRACTED CORPSE UNCLEANNESS PRESSED OUT14
THE JUICE OF OLIVES OR GRAPES15 WHOSE BULK WAS EXACTLY THAT OF AN EGG,
THE JUICE REMAINS CLEAN16 PROVIDED HE DOES NOT TOUCH THE PLACE ON
WHICH THE LIQUID IS; BUT [IF THE BULK WAS] MORE THAN THAT OF AN EGG, THE
JUICE BECOMES UNCLEAN,17 FOR SO SOON AS THE FIRST DROP ISSUED FORTH IT
BECAME UNCLEAN BY CONTACT WITH AN EGG'S BULK. IF THE PERSON18 WAS A ZAB
OR A ZABAH [THE JUICE] BECOMES UNCLEAN EVEN IF ONLY ONE BERRY [WAS
PRESSED OUT]. FOR SO SOON AS THE FIRST DROP ISSUED FORTH IT19 BECAME
UNCLEAN20 BY CARRYING.21 IF A ZAB MILKED A GOAT, THE MILK BECOMES
UNCLEAN, FOR SO SOON AS THE FIRST DROP COMES FORTH IT19 BECOMES
UNCLEAN20 BY CARRYING.21
MISHNAH 4. IF AN EGG'S BULK22 OF FOODSTUFFS23 , WAS LEFT IN THE SUN AND IT
SHRANK,24 AND SO ALSO IN THE CASE OF AN OLIVE'S BULK OF CORPSE,25 AN
OLIVE'S22 BULK OF CARRION,25 A LENTIL'S BULK22 OF A DEAD CREEPING THING,25 AN
OLIVE'S22 BULK OF PIGGUL,26 AN OLIVE'S BULK22 OF NOTHAR,26 OR AN OLIVE'S
BULK22 OF FORBIDDEN FAT25 THEY BECOME CLEAN; NOR DOES ONE INCUR GUILT
ON ACCOUNT OF THESE FOR TRANSGRESSING THE LAW OF PIGGUL, NOTHAR OR
UNCLEANNESS.27 IF THEY WERE THEN LEFT OUT IN THE RAIN AND THEY SWELLED,
THEY28 BECOME UNCLEAN AND GUILT IS INCURRED ON ACCOUNT OF THEM FOR
TRANSGRESSING THE LAW OF PIGGUL, NOTHAR OR UNCLEANNESS.
MISHNAH 5. ALL DOUBTFUL CASES OF UNCLEANNESS ARE DETERMINED
ACCORDING TO THEIR APPEARANCE AT THE TIME THEY ARE FOUND: IF THEY WERE
THEN29 UNCLEAN THEY ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE BEEN UNCLEAN [ALL THE TIME]30
AND IF CLEAN29 THEY ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE BEEN CLEAN [ALL THE TIME]; IF
THEY WERE THEN29 COVERED31 THEY ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE BEEN COVERED [ALL
THE TIME] AND IF UNCOVERED29 THEY ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE BEEN UNCOVERED
[ALL THE TIME]; IF A NEEDLE WAS FOUND FULL OF RUST32 OR BROKEN,32 IT IS
CLEAN,33 FOR ALL DOUBTFUL CASES OF UNCLEANNESS ARE DETERMINED
ACCORDING TO THEIR APPEARANCE AT THE TIME THEY ARE FOUND.
MISHNAH 6. IF A DEAF-MUTE, AN IMBECILE OR A MINOR WAS FOUND IN AN ALLEY
WAY34 THAT CONTAINED AN UNCLEANNESS, HE IS PRESUMED TO BE CLEAN;35 BUT
ANY ONE OF SOUND SENSES36 IS PRESUMED TO BE UNCLEAN.37 FURTHER MORE,
WHATSOEVER LACKS UNDERSTANDING38 TO BE INQUIRED OF IS IN A CASE OF
DOUBTFUL UNCLEANNESS PRESUMED TO BE CLEAN.
MISHNAH 7. IF A CHILD39 WAS FOUND AT THE SIDE OF A GRAVEYARD WITH LILIES
IN HIS HAND, AND THE LILIES GREW ONLY IN A PLACE OF UNCLEANNESS, HE IS
NEVERTHELESS CLEAN, FOR IT MAY BE ASSUMED THAT AN OTHER PERSON
GATHERED THEM AND GAVE THEM TO HIM.40 SO ALSO WHERE AN ASS WAS AMONG
THE GRAVES41 HIS HARNESS REMAINS CLEAN.42
MISHNAH 8. IF A CHILD43 WAS FOUND44 BESIDE DOUGH45 WITH A PIECE OF DOUGH
IN HIS HAND, R. MEIR RULES THAT THE DOUGH46 IS CLEAN;47 BUT THE SAGES RULE
THAT IT IS UNCLEAN, SINCE IT IS THE NATURE OF A CHILD TO SLAP DOUGH.48 IF A
DOUGH49 BORE TRACES OF HENS’ PICKINGS AND THERE WAS UNCLEAN LIQUID IN
THE SAME HOUSE, THE LOAVES50 ARE DEEMED TO BE CLEAN IF THERE WAS
DISTANCE ENOUGH BETWEEN THE LIQUID AND THE LOAVES FOR THE HENS TO DRY
THEIR MOUTHS ON THE GROUND;51 AND, IN THE CASE OF A COW OR A DOG, IF
THERE WAS DISTANCE ENOUGH52 FOR IT TO LICK ITS TONGUE;53 AND, IN THE CASE
OF ALL OTHER BEASTS, IF THERE WAS DISTANCE ENOUGH52 FOR THEIR TONGUE TO
DRY. R. ELIEZER B. JACOB HOLDS THE DOUGH TO BE CLEAN IN THE CASE OF A DOG
WHO IS SAGACIOUS; FOR IT IS NOT ITS HABIT TO LEAVE FOOD54 AND GO AFTER THE
WATER.55
Mishna - Mas. Taharoth Chapter 4
MISHNAH 1. IF AN UNCLEAN1 OBJECT WAS THROWN FROM ONE PLACE TO
ANOTHER:2 A LOAF3 AMONG KEYS4 OR A KEY5 AMONG LOAVES,6 [THAT WHICH WAS
CLEAN REMAINS] CLEAN.7 R. JUDAH8 RULED: IF A LOAF3 WAS THROWN AMONG
KEYS4 THE FORMER BECOMES UNCLEAN, BUT IF A KEY5 WAS THROWN AMONG
LOAVES6 THE LATTER REMAIN CLEAN.
MISHNAH 2. IF A DEAD CREEPING THING WAS HELD IN THE MOUTH OF A WEASEL
THAT WAS PASSING OVER LOAVES OF TERUMAH AND IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER
THE CREEPING THING DID OR DID NOT TOUCH THEM, SUCH CONDITION OF DOUBT IS
DEEMED CLEAN.9
MISHNAH 3. IF A WEASEL HELD IN ITS MOUTH A [DEAD] CREEPING THING OR IF A
DOG HAD CARRION IN ITS MOUTH AND THEY PASSED BETWEEN CLEAN [PERSONS]
OR IF CLEAN PERSONS PASSED BETWEEN THEM,10 THEIR CONDITION OF DOUBT IS
DEEMED CLEAN, SINCE THE UNCLEANNESS11 , HAD NO RESTING PLACE.12 IF THEY13
WERE PICKING AT THEM14 WHILE THESE15 LAY ON THE GROUND,16 AND A PERSON
STATED, ‘I WENT TO THAT PLACE BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I DID OR DID NOT
TOUCH IT’,15 HIS CONDITION OF DOUBT IS DEEMED UNCLEAN, SINCE THE
UNCLEANNESS HAD A RESTING PLACE.
MISHNAH 4. IF AN OLIVE'S BULK OF CORPSE WAS HELD IN A RAVEN'S MOUTH AND
IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER IT OVERSHADOWED A MAN OR VESSELS IN A PRIVATE
DOMAIN, THE MAN'S CONDITION OF DOUBT IS DEEMED TO BE UNCLEAN17 BUT THE
VESSELS’ CONDITION OF DOUBT IS DEEMED CLEAN.18 IF A MAN DREW WATER IN
TEN BUCKETS19 AND A DEAD CREEPING THING WAS FOUND IN ONE OF THEM,20 IT
ALONE IS DEEMED UNCLEAN BUT ALL THE OTHERS REMAIN CLEAN.21 IF ONE
POURED OUT FROM ONE VESSEL INTO ANOTHER AND A DEAD CREEPING THING WAS
FOUND IN THE LOWER VESSEL, THE UPPER ONE REMAINS CLEAN.22
MISHNAH 5. ON ACCOUNT OF SIX DOUBTFUL CASES OF UNCLEANNESS IS
TERUMAH BURNT:23 ON ACCOUNT OF THE DOUBT OF A BETH HA-PERAS [GRAVE
AREA],24 ON ACCOUNT OF EARTH25 ABOUT WHICH THERE IS DOUBT WHETHER IT
CAME FROM THE LAND OF THE GENTILES,26 ON ACCOUNT OF A DOUBT ABOUT THE
GARMENTS OF AN ‘AM HA-AREZ,27 ON ACCOUNT OF A DOUBT ABOUT VESSELS
FOUND BY CHANCE,28 ON ACCOUNT OF SPITTLE ENCOUNTERED BY CHANCE,29 ON
ACCOUNT OF A DOUBT ABOUT HUMAN URINE29 THAT WAS NEAR THE URINE OF A
BEAST.30 ON ACCOUNT OF A CERTAINTY OF HAVING TOUCHED THESE, WHICH GIVES
RISE TO THE DOUBTFUL UNCLEANNESS,31 TERUMAH IS BURNT. R. JOSE RULED: ALSO
ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR DOUBTFUL CONTACT32 IN A PRIVATE DOMAIN;33 BUT THE
SAGES RULED: IN A PRIVATE DOMAIN THE TERUMAH IS ONLY HELD IN SUSPENSE34
AND IN A PUBLIC DOMAIN IT IS DEEMED CLEAN.35
MISHNAH 6. IN THE CASE OF TWO KINDS OF SPITTLE, ONE OF WHICH WAS
[POSSIBLY] UNCLEAN36 AND THE OTHER WAS DECIDEDLY CLEAN, [ANY TERUMAH]
IS TO BE HELD IN SUSPENSE IF [TOUCHED BY ONE WHO] TOUCHED OR CARRIED OR
SHIFTED [ONE OF THE TWO KINDS OF SPITTLE] WHILE THEY WERE IN A PRIVATE
DOMAIN, OR, WHO TOUCHED ONE OF THEM IN A PUBLIC DOMAIN WHILE IT WAS
STILL MOIST, OR WHO CARRIED IT IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER IT WAS MOIST OR
DRY. IF THERE WAS BUT ONE [KIND OF POSSIBLY] UNCLEAN Spittle AND A MAN
TOUCHED, CARRIED OR SHIFTED IT IN A PUBLIC DOMAIN, TERUMAH37 IS BURNT ON
ACCOUNT OF IT; AND IT IS STILL MORE EVIDENT THAT THIS IS THE CASE IF IT WAS38
IN A PRIVATE DOMAIN.
MISHNAH 7. THE FOLLOWING CASES OF DOUBTFUL UNCLEANNESS THE SAGES
DECLARED TO BE CLEAN:39 A CONDITION OF DOUBT CONCERNING DRAWN WATER
IN RESPECT OF A RITUAL BATH,40 AND A CONDITION OF DOUBT CONCERNING AN
OBJECT OF UNCLEANNESS THAT FLOATED UPON THE WATER.41 IN THE CASE OF A
CONDITION OF DOUBT CONCERNING LIQUIDS AS TO WHETHER THEY HAVE
CONTRACTED UNCLEANNESS IT IS DEEMED UNCLEAN, BUT IF IT WAS WHETHER
UNCLEANNESS HAS BEEN CONVEYED IT IS DEEMED CLEAN. IF THERE IS DOUBT
CONCERNING THE HANDS AS TO WHETHER THEY HAVE CONTRACTED
UNCLEANNESS, HAVE CONVEYED UNCLEANNESS OR42 HAVE ATTAINED
CLEANNESS, THEY ARE DEEMED CLEAN. [THE SAGES, MOREOVER, DECLARED AS
CLEAN] A CONDITION OF DOUBT THAT AROSE IN A PUBLIC DOMAIN;43 A CONDITION
OF DOUBT CONCERNING AN ORDINANCE OF THE SCRIBES; A CONDITION OF DOUBT
CONCERNING COMMON FOODSTUFFS;41 A CONDITION OF DOUBT CONCERNING
CREEPING THINGS; A CONDITION OF DOUBT CONCERNING LEPROSY SIGNS; A
CONDITION OF DOUBT CONCERNING A NAZIRITE VOW; A CONDITION OF DOUBT
CONCERNING FIRSTLINGS; AND A CONDITION OF DOUBT CONCERNING SACRIFICES.
MISHNAH 8. ‘A CONDITION OF DOUBT CONCERNING AN OBJECT OF UNCLEANNESS
THAT FLOATED UPON THE WATER’44 [IS DEEMED CLEAN] WHETHER45 THE WATER
WAS IN VESSELS OR IN THE GROUND. R. SIMEON RULED: IF IN VESSELS IT IS
DEEMED UNCLEAN46 BUT IF IN THE GROUND IT IS DEEMED CLEAN.47 R. JUDAH
RULED: IF THE DOUBT48 AROSE WHEN THE MAN WENT DOWN INTO THE WATER HE
IS DEEMED UNCLEAN,49 BUT IF WHEN HE CAME UP50 HE IS DEEMED CLEAN. R. JOSE
RULED: EVEN IF THE ROOM AVAILABLE51 WAS NO MORE THAN WHAT SUFFICED FOR
THE MAN AND THE UNCLEANNESS THE FORMER REMAINS CLEAN.
MISHNAH 9. ‘IN THE CASE OF A CONDITION OF DOUBT CONCERNING LIQUIDS AS
TO WHETHER THEY HAVE CONTRACTED UNCLEANNESS IT IS DEEMED UNCLEAN’.52
IN WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES? IF AN UNCLEAN PERSON STRETCHED HIS FOOT
BETWEEN CLEAN LIQUIDS AND THERE IS DOUBT WHETHER HE TOUCHED THEM OR
NOT, SUCH A CONDITION OF DOUBT IS DEEMED TO BE UNCLEAN. IF A MAN HAD AN
UNCLEAN LOAF IN HIS HAND AND HE STRETCHED IT OUT53 BETWEEN CLEAN
LIQUIDS, AND THERE IS DOUBT WHETHER IT TOUCHED THEM OR NOT, SUCH A
CONDITION OF DOUBT IS DEEMED TO BE UNCLEAN. ‘BUT IF IT WAS WHETHER
UNCLEANNESS HAS BEEN CONVEYED, IT IS DEEMED CLEAN’.52 IN WHAT
CIRCUMSTANCE? IF A MAN HAD IN HIS HAND A STICK ON THE END OF WHICH THERE
WAS AN UNCLEAN LIQUID AND HE THREW IT AMONG CLEAN LOAVES AND THERE IS
DOUBT WHETHER IT TOUCHED THEM54 OR NOT, SUCH A CONDITION OF DOUBT IS
DEEMED CLEAN.
MISHNAH 10. R. JOSE RULED: A CONDITION OF DOUBT55 IN THE CASE OF LIQUIDS
IS DEEMED UNCLEAN IN RESPECT OF FOODSTUFFS56 AND CLEAN IN RESPECT OF
VESSELS.57 HOW SO? IF THERE WERE TWO JARS,58 THE ONE UNCLEAN AND THE
OTHER CLEAN, AND A DOUGH WAS PREPARED WITH THE CONTENTS OF ONE OF
THEM AND A DOUBT AROSE AS TO WHETHER IT WAS PREPARED WITH THE
CONTENTS OF THE UNCLEAN, OR OF THE CLEAN ONE, SUCH IS ‘A CONDITION OF
DOUBT IN THE CASE OF LIQUIDS [WHICH] IS DEEMED UNCLEAN IN RESPECT OF
FOODSTUFFS AND CLEAN IN RESPECT OF VESSELS’.
MISHNAH 11. ‘IF THERE IS DOUBT CONCERNING THE HANDS AS TO WHETHER
THEY HAVE CONTRACTED UNCLEANNESS,59 HAVE CONVEYED UNCLEANNESS60 OR
HAVE ATTAINED CLEANNESS, THEY ARE DEEMED CLEAN’.61 ‘ANY CONDITION OF
DOUBT62 THAT AROSE IN A PUBLIC DOMAIN’61 IS DEEMED CLEAN’ ‘A CONDITION OF
DOUBT CONCERNING AN ORDINANCE OF THE SCRIBES’61 [NAMELY, IF A MAN IS
UNCERTAIN WHETHER] HE ATE UNCLEAN FOODSTUFFS OR DRANK UNCLEAN
LIQUIDS, WHETHER HE IMMERSED HIS HEAD AND THE GREATER PART OF HIS BODY
IN DRAWN WATER,63 OR WHETHER THERE FELL ON HIS HEAD AND THE GREATER
PART OF HIS BODY THREE LOG OF DRAWN WATER,64 SUCH A CONDITION OF
DOUBT65 IS DEEMED CLEAN. IF, HOWEVER, A CONDITION OF DOUBT AROSE
CONCERNING A FATHER OF UNCLEANNESS EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ONLY
RABBINICAL, IT IS DEEMED UNCLEAN.
MISHNAH 12. ‘A CONDITION OF DOUBT CONCERNING COMMON FOODSTUFFS’61
REFERS TO THE CLEANNESS PRACTICED BY PHARISEES.66 ‘A CONDITION OF DOUBT
CONCERNING CREEPING THING’67 — [THIS IS DETERMINED] ACCORDING [TO THEIR
CONDITION AT] THE TIME THEY ARE FOUND.68 ‘A CONDITION OF DOUBT
CONCERNING LEPROSY SIGNS’67 — [A LEPROSY SIGN]69 IS DEEMED CLEAN IN THE
BEGINNING BEFORE IT HAD BEEN DETERMINED TO BE UNCLEAN, BUT AFTER IT HAD
BEEN DETERMINED TO BE UNCLEAN, A CONDITION OF DOUBT70 IS DEEMED
UNCLEAN. ‘A CONDITION OF DOUBT CONCERNING A NAZIRITE VOW’67 — [IN SUCH A
CONDITION OF DOUBT71 THE MAN] IS PERMITTED [ALL THAT IS FORBIDDEN TO A
NAZIRITE].72 ‘A CONDITION OF DOUBT CONCERNING FIRSTLINGS’69 — [IN SUCH A
CASE ONE IS EXEMPT FROM GIVING THE FIRSTLINGS TO THE PRIEST] IRRESPECTIVE
OF WHETHER THEY ARE FIRSTBORN OF MEN73 OR FIRSTLINGS OF CATTLE,74
WHETHER THE FIRSTLINGS OF AN UNCLEAN BEAST75 OR A CLEAN ONE, FOR IT IS
THE MAN WHO ADVANCES THE CLAIM76 AGAINST HIS FELLOW THAT MUST
PRODUCE THE PROOF.77
MISHNAH 13. ‘AND A CONDITION OF DOUBT CONCERNING SACRIFICES’67 — IF A
WOMAN HAS EXPERIENCED FIVE DOUBTFUL CASES OF MISCARRIAGE OR FIVE

UNCLEAN,17 BUT THE SAGES RULE THAT HE IS CLEAN.18 R. JOSE RULES THAT HE IS
UNCLEAN IN EVERY CASE19 AND CLEAN ONLY IN THAT OF THE PATH,20 SINCE IT IS
THE USUAL PRACTICE FOR MEN TO GO21 BUT IT IS NOT THEIR USUAL PRACTICE TO
TOUCH.22
MISHNAH 3. IF THERE WERE TWO PATHS,23 THE ONE UNCLEAN24 AND THE OTHER
CLEAN,25 AND A MAN WALKED BY ONE OF THEM AND THEN PREPARED CLEAN
FOODSTUFFS26 WHICH WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CONSUMED AND, HAVING BEEN
SPRINKLED UPON ONCE AND A SECOND TIME27 AND HAVING PERFORMED

ALIVE OR DEAD, BUT IN THE MORNING WHEN HE GOT UP HE FOUND HIM TO BE
DEAD, R. MEIR RULES THAT HE48 IS CLEAN, BUT THE SAGES RULE THAT HE IS

WAS AN UNCLEANNESS IN A CERTAIN FIELD, AND HE STATED, ‘I WENT INTO THAT

DOMAIN IN RESPECT OF THE SABBATH AND AS A PUBLIC DOMAIN IN RESPECT OF
UNCLEANNESS.
MISHNAH 9. A FORUM37 IS REGARDED AS A PRIVATE DOMAIN IN RESPECT OF THE

HANDMILL, ONLY THAT PART OF THE HOUSE IS DEEMED UNCLEAN TO WHICH SHE
CAN STRETCH OUT HER HAND AND TOUCH IT. IF THERE WERE TWO WOMEN,16 THE
HOUSE IS UNCLEAN IN EITHER CASE,17 SINCE, WHILE THE ONE IS GRINDING, THE

MISHNAH 8. IF ONE46 WHO WAS CLEAN HAD GIVEN UP THE THOUGHT OF EATING
[HIS TERUMAH]. R. JUDAH RULES THAT IT47 STILL48 REMAINS CLEAN, SINCE IT IS
USUAL FOR UNCLEAN PERSONS TO KEEP AWAY FROM IT.49 BUT THE SAGES RULE

AKIBA RULES THAT THEY54 ARE UNCLEAN, BUT THE SAGES RULE THAT THEY ARE
CLEAN. SAID R. ELIEZER B. PILA:55 IS BUT WHY DOES R. AKIBA RULE THAT THEY

HA-AREZ.
MISHNAH 4. IF A MAN LEFT HIS HOUSE OPEN AND FOUND IT OPEN,23 OR CLOSED

UNCLEANNESS; BUT IF HE INTENDED IT FOR A DOG IT IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO

UNCLEANNESS. IF A DEAF MUTE, AN IMBECILE OR A MINOR INTENDED IT AS FOOD,34
IT REMAINS INSUSCEPTIBLE; BUT IF THEY PICKED IT UP34 IT BECOMES SUSCEPTIBLE;
SINCE ONLY AN ACT OF THEIRS35 IS EFFECTIVE WHILE THEIR INTENTION IS OF NO
CONSEQUENCE.
MISHNAH 7. THE OUTER PARTS OF VESSELS THAT HAVE CONTRACTED

MISHNAH 6. IF A MAN PUT HIS OLIVES ON A ROOF TO DRY, EVEN THOUGH THEY
ARE PILED UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A CUBIT,46 THEY DO NOT BECOME47 SUSCEPTIBLE
TO UNCLEANNESS.48 IF HE PUT THEM IN THE HOUSE TO PUTRIFY, THOUGH HE
INTENDS TO TAKE THEM UP ON THE ROOF,49 OR IF HE PUT THEM ON THE ROOF THAT
THEY MIGHT OPEN SO THAT THEY COULD BE SALTED,50 THEY BECOME
SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS. IF HE PUT THEM IN THE HOUSE WHILE HE

OLIVES, THE LATTER REMAIN CLEAN.75 IF IT WAS FOUND [ON OLIVES76 THAT WERE
LYING] ON THE ROOF [OF THE VAT],77 [THE OLIVES IN] THE VAT REMAIN CLEAN.75 IF
