Parah, Chapter Twelve, Mishnah Ten

Mishnah Ten
The lid of a kettle which is joined to a chain: 
Bet Shammai say: these are regarded as connected in respect of uncleanness but not in respect of sprinkling. 
Bet Hillel say: if he sprinkled on the kettle, it is the same as if the lid also was sprinkled upon; but if he sprinkled on the lid only it is not the same as if the kettle also was sprinkled upon. 
All are eligible to sprinkle, except a tumtum, a hermaphrodite, a woman, and a child that is without understanding. 
A woman may assist [a man] while he sprinkles, and hold the water for him while he dips and sprinkles. 
If she held his hand, even if only at the time of sprinkling, it is invalid.

Explanation
Section one: The chain is attached to the lid of the kettle. According to Bet Shammai we rule stringently in this case. If either the chain or the lid becomes impure, the other is impure as well. However, to purify them he must sprinkle on both.
Bet Hillel rules that the lid is primary to the chain. Therefore, if he sprinkles on the lid, the chain is made clean. However, if he sprinkles only on the chain, the lid remains unclean.
Section two: Numbers 19:18 says, "18A person (איש) who is clean shall take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle on the tent and on all the vessels and people who were there." The rabbis take the word for person "ish" to mean that anyone who is an "ish" can perform this ritual. It is not limited to priests. However it does limit the following people who do not fall under the rabbinic classification of "ish." A tumtum is a person who lacks the signs of either gender. A hermaphrodite has both male and female organs. A woman is excluded, according to the rabbis, from the category of "ish." A child who is too young to intend to perform the sprinkling is also not considered an "ish."
Section three: A woman can aid the man while he sprinkles, but she can't actually hold his hand, neither while dipping the hyssop nor while sprinkling.
