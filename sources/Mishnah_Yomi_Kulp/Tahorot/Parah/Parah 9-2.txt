Parah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our mishnah addresses what the rule is if insects fall into the mixture. 

Mishnah Two
If insects or creeping things fell into it, and they burst apart or the color [of the water] changed, the contents become invalid. 
A beetle causes invalidity in any case, because it is like a tube. 
Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob ruled: a maggot or a weevil of the grain causes no invalidity, because they contain no moisture.

Explanation
Section one: If the insects or creepy crawly things burst apart or somehow make the color of the water change, then the water is invalid (and yucky). However, if they just fall in, they can be fished out and the water remains valid. 
Section two: According to rabbinic entomology, a beetle is shaped like a tube. Therefore the water in the flask will enter it, mix with the beetle's own emissions and be reemitted back into the water, thereby disqualifying the mixture. This does not occur, evidently, with other types of insects.
Section three: These two sages hold that if a grain maggot or weevil falls into the water, it does not disqualify the water even if it bursts. These insects are dry and therefore will not discharge anything into the water.
