Oktzim, Chapter Two, Mishnah Ten

Mishnah Ten
	•	Vessels made of cattle dung or of earth through which the roots can penetrate, do not render the seeds susceptible. 
	•	A perforated plant-pot does not render seeds susceptible; but if it has no hole, the seeds do become susceptible. 
	•	What should be the hole's dimension? Such that a small root can push its way through. 
	•	If it was filled with earth to its brim, it is deemed as a frame without an edge.

Explanation
Section one: If a pot is made of cattle dung or earth and the pot has been perforated so that roots can penetrate to the ground do not allow the seeds inside to become susceptible to impurity. This means that if rain water falls into this pot, the seeds are not susceptible to impurity.
Section two: Produce growing in perforated pots is considered to be attached to the ground. Therefore, anything in it is not susceptible to impurity. But pots without holes are treated as if they are not "ground" and produce growing in there is susceptible.
To be considered "perforated" the hole must be at least wide enough for a small root to push through.
Section three: If the pot was completely filled up, all the way to the brim, then it is treated like a "frame without an edge" (see Kelim 2:3). This means that there is no "inside" to the frame or in this case the pot. So anything that grows in such a pot is not susceptible to impurity.
