Mikvaot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
If a non-Jewish woman discharged semen from an Israelite, it is unclean. 
If an Israelite woman discharged semen from a non-Jewish man, it is clean. 
If a woman had intercourse and then went down and immersed herself but did not   sweep out the house, it is as though she had not immersed herself.   
If a man who had a seminal emission immersed himself but did not first pass urine, he again becomes unclean when he passes urine.   
Rabbi Yose says: if he was sick or old he is unclean, but if he was young and healthy he remains clean.

Explanation
Section one: In general, non-Jews were considered to be outside the scope of the Israelite purity laws. Only semen from an Israelite is considered halakhically unclean. Therefore, the religion of the woman who discharged the semen is irrelevant; only the religion of the man has any relevance.
Section two: "Sweeping out the house" is a euphemism for a woman cleaning herself out after sexual relations with a man. If she does not clean herself out, the semen defiles her when she immerses from the mikveh.
Section three: Urinating will flush out the semen that remains in the man. Therefore, he should urinate before he immerses in the mikveh. If he does not, he remains unclean. 
Rabbi Yose says that this is so only with an old or sick person, who evidently does not ejaculate with quite as much vigor. A young healthy male expels all of the semen and therefore does not need to urinate in order to clear himself out.
