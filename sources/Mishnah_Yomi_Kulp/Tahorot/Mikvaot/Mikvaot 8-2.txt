Mikvaot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Today's mishnah and tomorrow's deal with what constitutes a seminal emission such that a man must go to the mikveh. I know, you're thinking, doesn't a man know when one has had a emission? I would imagine that this is generally the case. But the rabbis talk about everything like this. They also talk about how a woman can distinguish between menstrual blood and blood from another source, even though most women probably can tell the difference. This is simply part of the way the rabbis talk. 

Mishnah Two
These are the men who had a seminal emission who require immersion: 
If he noticed that his urine issued in drops or was murky: 
At the beginning  he is clean;   
In the middle and at the end, he is unclean;  
From the beginning to the end, he is clean.   
If it was white and viscous, he is unclean.   
Rabbi Yose says: what is white counts like what is murky.

Explanation
Section one: The men listed below require immersion even though we are not one hundred per cent sure that they have had a seminal emission.
Section two: The liquid being emitted is not like urine, which generally doesn't come out in drops, as does semen. But then again, it is not like semen, which is usually white not murky. What is it?
If the stream begins this way, he is clean, for this is not considered semen. It is probably just problematic urination (yes, we've heard of this problem on radio ads).
If it occurs at the middle or end of his urination, then it is considered semen for it is unusual for urine to begin normally and then turn into murky drops.
If it occurs from the beginning to the end, then that's just the way he urinates. Hopefully, things will get better. 
Section three: If the issue was white and viscous, meaning in clumps, not little drops, then it is semen and he is unclean.
Rabbi Yose says that even if it is white, if he sees such a type of emission at the beginning, he is pure, the same as is true with murky liquid.
