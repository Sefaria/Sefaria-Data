Kelim, Chapter Twenty-Nine, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Today's mishnah continues to list how much of various cords and shafts are considered connected to the main vessel, be it a balance or a type of axe, or a type of hammer. 
The principles behind this mishnah are the same as those behind the other mishnayot we have already learned in this chapter. Therefore, there is not much commentary below. 

Mishnah Six
The cord of the balances of wool dealers  or of glass-weighers is regarded as connected up to a length of two handbreadths.
The shaft of a millstone chisel, up to a length of two handbreadths.
The shaft of the battle-axe of the legions, up to a length of two handbreadths.
The shaft of the goldsmithsâ€™ hammer, up to a length of two handbreadths.
And that of the blacksmiths' hammer, up to three handbreadths.
