Mishna - Mas. Kelim Chapter 1

MISHNAH 1. THE FATHERS OF UNCLEANNESS1 ARE A [DEAD] CREEPING THING,2 SEMEN VIRILE, [AN ISRAELITE] WHO HAS CONTRACTED CORPSE UNCLEANNESS, A LEPER DURING THE DAYS OF HIS COUNTING3 AND THE WATERS OF PURIFlcation4 WHOSE QUANTITY IS LESS THAN THE MINIMUM PRESCRIBED FOR SPRINKLING.5 BEHOLD, THESE CONVEY UNCLEANNESS TO MEN AND VESSELS BY CONTACT AND TO EARTHENWARE BY PRESENCE WITHIN THEIR AIRSPACE,6 BUT7 THEY CANNOT CONVEY UNCLEANNESS BY CARRIAGE.

   	MISHNAH 2. ON A HIGHER PLANE8 THAN THESE9 ARE CARRION AND WATERS OF PURIFICATION WHOSE QUANTITY IS SUFFICIENT TO BE SPRINKLED, FOR THESE CONVEY UNCLEANNESS TO MAN BY CARRIAGE,10 SO THAT HE IN TURN11 CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS TO CLOTHING BY CONTACT.12 CLOTHING, HOWEVER,13 IS FREE FROM UNCLEANNESS WHERE THERE WAS14 CONTACT ALONE.15

   	MISHNAH 3. ON A HIGHER PLANE16 IS THE MAN WHO HAD INTERCOURSE WITH A MENSTRUANT, FOR HE CONVEYS TO THAT ON WHICH HE LIES17 THE SAME UNCLEANNESS AS [A ZAB18 CONVEYS] TO THAT19 WHICH LIES ABOVE HIM.20 ON A HIGHER PLANE16 THAN THESE ARE THE ISSUE OF A ZAB, HIS SPITTLE, HIS SEMEN AND HIS URINE, AND THE BLOOD OF A MENSTRUANT, FOR THEY CONVEY UNCLEANNESS21 BOTH BY CONTACT AND BY CARRIAGE.22 ON A HIGHER PLANE16 THAN THESE IS AN OBJECT ON WHICH ONE CAN RIDE,23 FOR IT CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS EVEN WHEN IT LIES UNDER A HEAVY STONE.24 ON A HIGHER PLANE16 THAN THE OBJECT ON WHICH ONE CAN RIDE IS THAT ON WHICH ONE CAN LIE, FOR IN THE LATTER CASE UNCLEANNESS25 IS CONVEYED BY CONTACT AS BY CARRIAGE.26 ON A HIGHER PLANE16 THAN THE OBJECT ON WHICH ONE CAN LIE IS THE ZAB, FOR A ZAB CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS TO THE OBJECT ON WHICH HE LIES27 WHILE THE OBJECT ON WHICH HE LIES28 CANNOT CONVEY THE SAME UNCLEANNESS23 TO THAT UPON WHICH IT LIES.29
MISHNAH 4. ON A HIGHER PLANE16 THAN THE ZAB IS THE ZABAH,30 FOR SHE CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS31 TO THE MAN WHO HAS INTERCOURSE WITH HER.32 ON A HIGHER PLANE THAN THE ZABAH IS THE LEPER, FOR HE CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS33 BY ENTERING INTO A HOUSE.34 ON A HIGHER PLANE THAN THE LEPER IS A BONE35 OF THE SIZE OF A BARLEY GRAIN, FOR IT36 CONVEYS AN UNCLEANNESS OF SEVEN DAYS. MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN ALL THESE IS A CORPSE, FOR IT CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS BY OHEL37 WHEREBY ALL THE OTHERS CONVEY NO UNCLEANNESS.38

   	MISHNAH 5. TEN GRADES OF UNCLEANNESS39 EMANATE FROM MEN: A MAN40 BEFORE THE OFFERING OF HIS OBLIGATORY SACRIFICES41 IS FORBIDDEN TO EAT HOLY THINGS BUT PERMITTED TO EAT TERUMAH AND [SECOND] TITHE. IF HE IS42 A TEBUL YOM43 HE IS FORBIDDEN TO EAT HOLY THINGS AND TERUMAH BUT PERMITTED THE EATING OF [SECOND] TITHE. IF HE42 EMITTED SEMEN44 HE IS FORBIDDEN TO EAT ANY OF THE THREE. IF HE42 HAD INTERCOURSE WITH A MENSTRUANT HE CONVEYS THE SAME UNCLEANNESS TO THAT ON WHICH HE LIES AS [A ZAB CONVEYS] TO THAT WHICH LIES ABOVE HIM.45 IF HE IS42 A ZAB WHO HAS OBSERVED TWO DISCHARGES HE CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS TO THAT ON WHICH HE LIES OR SITS AND IS REQUIRED TO UNDERGO IMMERSION IN RUNNING WATER,46 BUT IS EXEMPT FROM THE SACRIFICE.47 IF HE OBSERVED THREE DISCHARGES HE MUST BRING THE SACRIFICE.48 IF HE49 IS A LEPER THAT WAS ONLY SHUT UP50 HE CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS51 BY ENTRY52 BUT IS EXEMPT FROM LOOSENING HIS HAIR,53 FROM RENDING HIS CLOTHES,53 FROM SHAVING54 AND FROM THE BIRDS OFFERING;55 BUT IF HE WAS A CONFIRMED LEPER56 , HE IS LIABLE TO ALL THESE. IF A LIMB ON WHICH THERE WAS NOT THE PROPER QUANTITY OF FLESH57 WAS SEVERED FROM A PERSON, IT CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT AND BY CARRIAGE BUT NOT BY OHEL; BUT IF IT BEARS THE PROPER QUANTITY OF FLESH IT CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT, BY CARRIAGE AND BY OHEL. A ‘PROPER QUANTITY OF FLESH’ IS SUCH AS IS CAPABLE OF HEALING. R. JUDAH EXPLAINED: IF IN ONE PLACE IT58 HAS FLESH SUFFICIENT TO SURROUND IT58 WITH [THE THICKNESS OF] A THREAD OF THE WOOF59 IT IS CAPABLE OF HEALING.
MISHNAH 6. THERE ARE TEN GRADES OF HOLINESS: THE LAND OF ISRAEL IS HOLIER THAN ALL OTHER LANDS. AND WHAT IS THE NATURE OF ITS HOLINESS? THAT FROM IT ARE BROUGHT THE ‘OMER,60 THE FIRSTFRUITS61 AND THE TWO LOAVES,62 WHICH MAY NOT BE BROUGHT FROM ANY OF THE OTHER LANDS.

   	MISHNAH 7. CITIES63 THAT ARE WALLED64 ARE HOLIER,65 FOR LEPERS MUST BE SENT OUT OF THEM AND A CORPSE, THOUGH IT MAY BE CARRIED ABOUT WITHIN THEM AS LONG AS IT IS DESIRED,66 MAY NOT BE BROUGHT BACK ONCE IT HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT.

   	MISHNAH 8. THE AREA WITHIN THE WALL67 IS HOLIER, FOR IT IS THERE68 THAT HOLY THINGS OF A MINOR DEGREE AND SECOND TITHE MAY BE EATEN. THE TEMPLE MOUNT69 IS HOLler, FOR NEITHER ZABS NOR ZABAHS NOR MENSTRUANTS NOR WOMEN AFTER CHILDBIRTH MAY ENTER IT. THE RAMPART70 IS HOLIER, FOR NEITHER IDOLATERS NOR ONE WHO CONTRACTED CORPSE UNCLEANNESS MAY ENTER IT. THE COURT OF WOMEN71 IS HOLIER, FOR NO TEBUL YOM72 MAY ENTER IT, THOUGH NO SIN-OFFERING IS THEREBY INCURRED. THE COURT OF THE ISRAELITES73 IS HOLIER, FOR A MAN WHO HAS NOT YET OFFERED HIS OBLIGATORY SACRIFICES74 MAY NOT ENTER IT, AND IF HE ENTERS HE INCURS THEREBY A SIN-OFFERING. THE COURT OF THE PRIESTS75 IS HOLIER, FOR NO ISRAELITES MAY ENTER IT EXCEPT WHEN THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO SO76 IN CONNECTION WITH THE LAYING ON OF HANDS,77 SLAYING OR WAVING.78
MISHNAH 9. THE AREA BETWEEN THE ULAM79 AND THE ALTAR IS HOLIER,80 FOR MEN AFFLICTED WITH BLEMISHES OR WITH A WILD GROWTH OF HAIR MAY NOT ENTER IT. THE HEKAL IS HOLIER, FOR NO ONE WHOSE HANDS OR FEET ARE UNWASHED MAY ENTER IT. THE HOLY OF HOLIES IS HOLler, FOR ONLY THE HIGH PRIEST, ON THE DAY OF ATONEMENT, AT THE SERVICE,81 MAY ENTER IT.82 R. JOSE STATED: IN FIVE RESPECTS IS THE AREA BETWEEN THE ULAM AND THE ALTAR ON A PAR WITH THE HEKAL, FOR THOSE AFFLICTED WITH BLEMISHES OR WITH A WILD GROWTH OF HAIR, OR WHO HAVE DRUNK WINE OR WHOSE HANDS OR FEET ARE UNWASHED MAY NOT ENTER THERE,83 AND THE PEOPLE MUST KEEP AWAY FROM THE AREA BETWEEN THE ULAM AND THE ALTAR84 WHEN THE INCENSE IS BEING BURNED.85  
MISHNAH 1. VESSELS OF WOOD, VESSELS OF LEATHER, VESSELS OF BONE OR VESSELS OF GLASS THAT ARE FLAT ARE CLEAN1 AND THOSE THAT FORM A RECEPTACLE ARE UNCLEAN.2 IF THEY WERE BROKEN THEY BECOME CLEAN1 AGAIN. IF ONE REMADE THEM INTO VESSELS THEY ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS HENCEFORTH.3 EARTHEN VESSELS AND VESSELS OF ALUM- CRYSTALS ARE ON A PAR IN RESPECT OF UNCLEANNESS: THEY CONTRACT AND CONVEY4 UNCLEANNESS THROUGH THEIR AIR-SPACE,5 THEY CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS6 THROUGH THEIR [CONCAVE] BOTTOMS BUT NOT7 THROUGH THEIR BACKS;8 AND WHEN BROKEN9 THEY BECOME CLEAN.1
MISHNAH 2. AS REGARDS THE SMALLEST EARTHEN VESSELS, AND THE BOTTOMS AND SIDES [OF THE LARGER BUT BROKEN VESSELS] THAT CAN STAND10 UNSUPPORTED,11 THE PRESCRIBED SIZE12 IS A CAPACITY TO HOLD OIL SUFFICIENT FOR THE ANOINTING OF A LITTLE FINGER OF A CHILD IF13 THEIR FORMER CAPACITY14 WAS THAT OF15 A LOG. IF13 THEIR FORMER CAPACITY14 WAS FROM ONE LOG TO SE'AH THEIR PRESENT CAPACITY12 MUST BE A QUARTER OF A LOG; IF IT WAS14 FROM A SE'AH TO TWO SE'AH IT MUST BE16 HALF A LOG; IF17 FROM TWO SE'AH TO THREE SE'AH OR AS MUCH AS FIVE SE'AH IT MUST BE18 A LOG; SO R. ISHMAEL. R. AKIBA STATED: I DO NOT PRESCRIBE ANY SIZE FOR THE UNBROKEN VESSELS,19 BUT20 THIS IS THE RULE: AS REGARDS THE SMALLEST EARTHEN VESSELS, AND THE BOTTOMS AND SIDES [OF LARGER BUT BROKEN ONES] THAT CAN STAND21 UNSUPPORTED,22 THE PRESCRIBED SIZE23 IS A CAPACITY TO HOLD ENOUGH OIL TO ANOINT THE LITTLE FINGER OF A CHILD. [THIS SIZE IS PRESCRIBED FOR POTS] THAT ARE NOT BIGGER THAN24 THE SMALL COOKING-POTS. FOR SMALL COOKING-POTS AND FOR THOSE BETWEEN THESE AND THE LYDDA JARS THE PRESCRIBED CAPACITY23 IS A QUARTER OF A LOG. FOR THOSE WHICH HAVE A SIZE BETWEEN THAT OF LYDDA JARS AND THE BETHLEHEM JARS THE CAPACITY23 MUST BE THAT OF HALF A LOG. FOR THOSE BETWEEN THE BETHLEHEM JARS AND LARGE STONE JARS THE CAPACITY23 MUST BE THAT OF A LOG. R. JOHANAN B. ZAKKAI RULED: THE PRESCRIBED CAPACITY23 FOR THE FRAGMENTS OF LARGE STONE JARS IS TWO LOGS, AND THAT FOR THE BOTTOMS OF BROKEN GALILEAN CRUSES AND SMALL JARS IS ANY WHATSOEVER, BUT THE FRAGMENTS OF THEIR SIDES ARE IN NO CASE SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS
MISHNAH 3. THE FOLLOWING25 ARE NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS AMONG EARTHEN VESSELS: A TRAY WITHOUT A RIM, A FIRE-PAN WITH BROKEN SIDES, A TUBE FOR ROASTING CORN, GUTTERS EVEN IF THEY ARE BENT26 AND EVEN IF THEY HAVE27 SOME FORM OF RECEPTACLE,28 A BASKET-COVER29 THAT WAS TURNED INTO A BREAD-BASKET,26 A PITCHER30 THAT HAS BEEN ADAPTED31 AS A COVER FOR GRAPES,32 A JAR30 FOR SWIMMERS,33 A SMALL JAR30 FIXED TO THE SIDES OF A LADLE,34 A BED, A STOOL, A BENCH, A TABLE, A SHIP,35 AND AN EARTHEN LAMP, BEHOLD THESE ARE INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS. THE FOLLOWING IS A GENERAL RULE:36 ANY AMONG EARTHEN VESSELS THAT HAS NO INNER PART IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS ON ITS OUTER SIDES.37

   	MISHNAH 4. A LANTERN THAT HAS A RECEPTACLE FOR OIL IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS, BUT ONE THAT HAS NONE IS INSUSCEPTIBLE. A POTTER'S MOULD ON WHICH ONE BEGINS TO SHAPE THE CLAY IS INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS,38 BUT THAT ON WHICH ONE FINISHES IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE.39 A FUNNEL FOR HOME USE40 IS INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS,38 BUT THAT OF PEDLARS IS SUSCEPTIBLE BECAUSE41 IT ALSO SERVES AS A MEASURE;42 SO R. JUDAH B. BATHYRA. R. AKIBA SAID: BECAUSE ONE PUTS IT ON ITS SIDE43 SO AS TO LET THE BUYER SMELL IT.44

   	MISHNAH 5. THE COVERS OF WINE JARS AND OIL JARS AND THE COVERS OF PAPYRUS45 JARS46 ARE INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS, BUT IF THEY WERE ADAPTED FOR USE AS RECEPTACLES THEY ARE SUSCEPTIBLE. THE COVER OF A STEW-POT IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS WHEN IT HAS A HOLE47 OR A POINTED TOP,48 BUT IF IT HAS NEITHER HOLE NOR POINTED TOP IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE BECAUSE SHE49 DRAINS THE VEGETABLES INTO IT. R. ELIEZER B. ZADOK SAID: BECAUSE SHE TURNS OUT THE CONTENTS [OF THE POT] ON TO IT.

	MISHNAH 6. IF A DAMAGED JAR50 WAS FOUND IN A FURNACE,51 BEFORE ITS MANUFACTURE WAS COMPLETE52 IT IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS,53 BUT IF AFTER ITS MANUFACTURE WAS COMPLETE54 IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE.55 AS TO A SPRINKLER,56 R. ELIEZER B. ZADOK HOLDS IT TO BE INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS; BUT R. JOSE HOLDS IT TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE BECAUSE IT LETS THE LIQUID OUT IN DROPS ONLY.57

   	MISHNAH 7. THE FOLLOWING AMONG EARTHEN VESSELS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS: A TRAY WITH A RIM, AN UNBROKEN FIRE-PAN, AND A TRAY MADE UP OF58 DISHES. IF ONE OF THEM59 CONTRACTED UNCLEANNESS FROM A [DEAD] CREEPING THING60 THEY DO NOT ALL BECOME UNCLEAN, BUT IF THE TRAY HAD A RIM THAT PROJECTED ABOVE THE RIMS OF THE DISHES AND ONE OF THEM61 CONTRACTED UNCLEANNESS ALL ARE RENDERED UNCLEAN.62 SIMILARLY WITH AN EARTHEN SPICE-POT63 AND A DOUBLE INK-POT.64 BUT IF ONE CONTAINER OF A WOODEN SPICE-BOX63 CONTRACTED UNCLEANNESS FROM A LIQUID,65 THE OTHER IS NOT RENDERED UNCLEAN.66 R. JOHANAN B. NURI RULED: ITS THICKNESS67 IS DEEMED TO BE DIVIDED68 AND THAT SIDE WHICH SERVES THE UNCLEAN ONE IS UNCLEAN WHILE THAT WHICH SERVES THE CLEAN ONE REMAINS CLEAN. IF ITS RIM PROJECTS ABOVE THE OTHERS AND ONE OF THEM69 CONTRACTED UNCLEANNESS THE OTHER ALSO IS RENDERED UNCLEAN.

   	MISHNAH 8. A TORCH70 IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS,71 AND THE RESERVOIR72 OF A LAMP CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS73 THROUGH ITS AIR- SPACE.74 THE COMB75 OF A COOLER,76 R. ELIEZER RULED, IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS,77 BUT THE SAGES RULED THAT IT WAS SUSCEPTIBLE.
Mishna - Mas. Kelim Chapter 3

MISHNAH 1. THE SIZE OF A HOLE THAT RENDERS AN EARTHEN VESSEL CLEAN1 IS THE FOLLOWING: IF THE VESSEL WAS USED FOR FOODSTUFFS THE HOLE MUST BE BIG ENOUGH FOR OLIVES [TO FALL THROUGH],2 IF IT WAS USED FOR LIQUIDS IT SUFFICES FOR THE HOLE TO BE BIG ENOUGH FOR LIQUIDS [TO BE ADMITTED THROUGH IT],3 AND IF IT WAS USED FOR BOTH IT IS SUBJECTED TO THE GREATER RESTRICTION, VIZ., THAT THE HOLE MUST BE BIG ENOUGH FOR OLIVES [TO FALL THROUGH].4

   	MISHNAH 2. AS REGARDS A JAR THE SIZE OF THE HOLE5 MUST BE SUCH THAT A DRIED FIG [WILL FALL THROUGH];4 SO R. SIMEON. R. JUDAH SAID: WALNUTS.6 R. MEIR SAID: OLIVES.6 THE SIZE OF A HOLE5 IN A STEW-POT OR A COOKING POT MUST BE SUCH THAT OLIVES [WILL FALL THROUGH]; IN A CRUSE AND A PITCHER, SUCH THAT OIL [WILL PENETRATE THROUGH IT];7 AND IN A COOLER, SUCH THAT WATER [WILL PENETRATE THROUGH IT].7 R. SIMEON RULED: THE SIZE OF THE HOLE IN THE CASE OF ALL THREE GROUPS8 MUST BE SUCH THAT SEED [WILL FALL THROUGH IT]. IN A LAMP THE SIZE OF THE HOLE5 MUST BE SUCH THAT OIL [WILL PENETRATE THROUGH IT].7 R. ELIEZER SAID: SUCH THAT A SMALL PERUTAH [WILL DROP OUT THROUGH IT].9 A LAMP10 WHOSE NOZZLE HAS BEEN REMOVED IS CLEAN;11 AND ONE MADE OF EARTH12 WHOSE NOZZLE HAS BEEN BURNT BY THE WICK IS ALSO CLEAN.11

   	MISHNAH 3. IF A JAR13 THAT HAD A HOLE14 WAS MENDED WITH PITCH15 AND THEN WAS BROKEN AGAIN,16 IF THE FRAGMENT THAT WAS MENDED WITH THE PITCH CAN CONTAIN A QUARTER OF A LOG17 IT IS UNCLEAN, SINCE THE DESIGNATION OF VESSEL HAS NEVER CEASED TO BE APPLIED TO IT. IF A POTSHERD HAD A HOLE THAT WAS MENDED WITH PITCH, IT IS CLEAN THOUGH IT CAN CONTAIN A QUARTER OF A LOG, BECAUSE THE DESIGNATION OF VESSEL HAS CEASED TO BE APPLIED TO IT.
ISHNAH 4. IF A JAR WAS CRACKED18 BUT19 , WAS LINED WITH CATTLE DUNG, ALTHOUGH THE POTSHERDS WOULD FALL APART WERE THE DUNG TO BE REMOVED,20 IT IS UNCLEAN,21 BECAUSE22 IT NEVER CEASED TO BEAR THE NAME OF VESSEL. IF IT WAS BROKEN23 AND SOME OF ITS SHERDS WERE STUCK TOGETHER AGAIN,24 OR IF SOME POTTER'S CLAY WAS BROUGHT FOR THE PURPOSE25 FROM ELSEWHERE, AND26 IT WAS ALSO LINED WITH CATTLE DUNG, EVEN THOUGH THE POTSHERDS HOLD TOGETHER WHEN THE DUNG IS REMOVED, IT IS CLEAN,27 BECAUSE IT28 CEASED TO BEAR THE NAME OF VESSEL. IF IT29 CONTAINED ONE SHERD THAT COULD HOLD30 A QUARTER OF A LOG,31 ALL ITS29 PARTS32 CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT,33 BUT THAT SHERD34 CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS THROUGH ITS AIR-SPACE.

   	MISHNAH 5. IF A SOUND VESSEL WAS LINED, R. MEIR AND R. SIMEON RULED: THE LINING35 CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS;36 BUT THE SAGES RULED: A LINING OVER A SOUND VESSEL IS INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS,37 , AND ONLY ONE OVER A CRACKED VESSEL IS SUSCEPTIBLE.38 AND THE SAME DISPUTE39 APPLIES TO THE HOOP40 OF A PUMPKIN SHELL.41

   	MISHNAH 6. AS TO SCUTCHGRASS WHEREWITH THE LARGEST JARS42 ARE LINED, ANY ONE THAT TOUCHES IT43 BECOMES UNCLEAN.44 THE PLUG OF A JAR45 IS NOT REGARDED AS CONNECTED.46 THAT47 , WHICH TOUCHES THE LINING OF AN OVEN48 IS UNCLEAN.49
MISHNAH 7. IF A CAULDRON50 WAS LINED WITh MORTAR AND WITH POTTER'S CLAY, THAT WHICH TOUCHES THE MORTAR IS UNCLEAN51 BUT THAT WHICH TOUCHES THE POTTER'S CLAY52 IS CLEAN.53 IF A KETTLE54 WAS PUNCTURED AND THE HOLE WAS STOPPED WITH PITCH, R. JOSE RULES THAT IT IS CLEAN SINCE IT CANNOT HOLD HOT WATER55 AS COLD.56 THE SAME RULING HE ALSO GAVE57 CONCERNING VESSELS MADE OF PITCH. IF COPPER VESSELS WERE LINED WITH PITCH THE LINING58 IS CLEAN,59 BUT IF THEY ARE USED FOR WINE60 , IT IS UNCLEAN.61

   	MISHNAH 8. IF A JAR WAS PERFORATED AND THE HOLE WAS STOPPED UP WITH MORE PITCH62 THAN WAS NECESSARY, THAT63 WHICH TOUCHES THE NEEDED PORTION IS UNCLEAN, BUT THAT WHICH TOUCHES THE UNNEEDED PORTION64 IS CLEAN. IF PITCH DRIPPED UPON A JAR,65 WHAT TOUCHES THE FORMER66 REMAINS CLEAN. IF A WOODEN OR EARTHEN FUNNEL WAS STOPPED UP WITH PITCH, R. ELEAZAR B. AZARIAH RULES THAT IT IS UNCLEAN.67 R. AKIBA RULES THAT IT IS UNCLEAN WHERE IT IS OF WOOD68 AND CLEAN WHERE IT IS OF EARTHENWARE.69 R. JOSE RULES THAT BOTH ARE CLEAN.70  
MISHNAH 1. A POTSHERD1 THAT CANNOT STAND UNSUPPORTED ON ACCOUNT OF ITS HANDLE,2 OR A POTSHERD WHOSE BOTTOM IS POINTED AND THAT POINT CAUSES IT TO OVERBALANCE, IS CLEAN.3 IF THE HANDLE WAS REMOVED OR THE POINT WAS BROKEN OFF IT IS STILL CLEAN.4 R. JUDAH RULES THAT IT IS UNCLEAN.5 IF A JAR WAS BROKEN6 BUT IS STILL CAPABLE OF HOLDING SOMETHING IN ITS SIDES, OR IF IT WAS SPLIT INTO A KIND OF TWO TROUGHS, R. JUDAH DECLARES IT CLEAN3 BUT THE SAGES DECLARE IT TO BE UNCLEAN.5

   	MISHNAH 2. IF A JAR WAS CRACKED AND CANNOT BE MOVED ABOUT WITH HALF A KAB OF DRIED FIGS IN IT, IT IS CLEAN.7 IF A DAMAGED VESSEL8 WAS CRACKED AND IT CANNOT HOLD ANY LIQUID, EVEN THOUGH IT CAN HOLD FOODSTUFFS, IT IS CLEAN,3 SINCE ONE REMNANT9 IS NOT USED FOR THE SAKE OF ANOTHER REMNANT.10

   	MISHNAH 3. WHAT IS MEANT BY A ‘DAMAGED VESSEL’?11 ONE WHOSE HANDLES WERE REMOVED.12 IF SHARP ENDS PROJECTED FROM IT,13 ANY PART OF IT WHICH CAN CONTAIN OLIVES14 CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT, WHILE ANY UNCLEANNESS OPPOSITE AN END15 CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS TO THE VESSEL THROUGH ITS AIR-SPACE, BUT ANY PART OF IT WHICH CANNOT CONTAIN OLIVES16 CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT. WHILE AN UNCLEANNESS OPPOSITE AN END15 DOES NOT CONVEY UNCLEANNESS TO THE VESSEL THROUGH ITS AIR-SPACE. IF IT17 WAS LEANING ON ITS SIDE18 LIKE A KIND OF CATHEDRA,19 ANY PART OF IT WHICH CAN CONTAIN OLIVES14 CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT, WHILE ANY UNCLEANNESS OPPOSITE AN END CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS TO THE VESSEL THROUGH ITS AIR-SPACE, BUT ANY PART OF IT WHICH CANNOT CONTAIN OLIVES16 CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT, WHILE AN UNCLEANNESS OPPOSITE AN END DOES NOT CONVEY UNCLEANNESS TO THE VESSEL THROUGH ITS AIR-SPACE.20 BOWLS WITH KORFIAN21 [BOTTOMS]22 , AND CUPS WITH ZIDONIAN21 BOTTOMS,23 ALTHOUGH THEY CANNOT STAND UNSUPPORTED, ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS, BECAUSE THEY WERE ORIGINALLY FASHIONED IN THIS MANNER. 

MISHNAH 1. A POTSHERD1 THAT CANNOT STAND UNSUPPORTED ON ACCOUNT OF ITS HANDLE,2 OR A POTSHERD WHOSE BOTTOM IS POINTED AND THAT POINT CAUSES IT TO OVERBALANCE, IS CLEAN.3 IF THE HANDLE WAS REMOVED OR THE POINT WAS BROKEN OFF IT IS STILL CLEAN.4 R. JUDAH RULES THAT IT IS UNCLEAN.5 IF A JAR WAS BROKEN6 BUT IS STILL CAPABLE OF HOLDING SOMETHING IN ITS SIDES, OR IF IT WAS SPLIT INTO A KIND OF TWO TROUGHS, R. JUDAH DECLARES IT CLEAN3 BUT THE SAGES DECLARE IT TO BE UNCLEAN.5

   	MISHNAH 2. IF A JAR WAS CRACKED AND CANNOT BE MOVED ABOUT WITH HALF A KAB OF DRIED FIGS IN IT, IT IS CLEAN.7 IF A DAMAGED VESSEL8 WAS CRACKED AND IT CANNOT HOLD ANY LIQUID, EVEN THOUGH IT CAN HOLD FOODSTUFFS, IT IS CLEAN,3 SINCE ONE REMNANT9 IS NOT USED FOR THE SAKE OF ANOTHER REMNANT.10

   	MISHNAH 3. WHAT IS MEANT BY A ‘DAMAGED VESSEL’?11 ONE WHOSE HANDLES WERE REMOVED.12 IF SHARP ENDS PROJECTED FROM IT,13 ANY PART OF IT WHICH CAN CONTAIN OLIVES14 CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT, WHILE ANY UNCLEANNESS OPPOSITE AN END15 CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS TO THE VESSEL THROUGH ITS AIR-SPACE, BUT ANY PART OF IT WHICH CANNOT CONTAIN OLIVES16 CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT. WHILE AN UNCLEANNESS OPPOSITE AN END15 DOES NOT CONVEY UNCLEANNESS TO THE VESSEL THROUGH ITS AIR-SPACE. IF IT17 WAS LEANING ON ITS SIDE18 LIKE A KIND OF CATHEDRA,19 ANY PART OF IT WHICH CAN CONTAIN OLIVES14 CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT, WHILE ANY UNCLEANNESS OPPOSITE AN END CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS TO THE VESSEL THROUGH ITS AIR-SPACE, BUT ANY PART OF IT WHICH CANNOT CONTAIN OLIVES16 CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT, WHILE AN UNCLEANNESS OPPOSITE AN END DOES NOT CONVEY UNCLEANNESS TO THE VESSEL THROUGH ITS AIR-SPACE.20 BOWLS WITH KORFIAN21 [BOTTOMS]22 , AND CUPS WITH ZIDONIAN21 BOTTOMS,23 ALTHOUGH THEY CANNOT STAND UNSUPPORTED, ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS, BECAUSE THEY WERE ORIGINALLY FASHIONED IN THIS MANNER.
MISHNAH 4. AS REGARDS AN EARTHEN VESSEL THAT HAS THREE RIMS, IF THE INNERMOST ONE PROJECTS ABOVE THE OTHERS ALL OUTSIDE IT IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS;24 IF THE OUTERMOST ONE PROJECTS ABOVE THE OTHERS ALL WITHIN IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS;25 AND IF THE MIDDLE ONE PROJECTS ABOVE THE OTHERS, THAT WHICH IS WITHIN IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS,25 WHILE THAT WHICH IS WITHOUT IT IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS.24 IF THEY26 WERE EQUAL IN HEIGHT, R. JUDAH RULED: THE MIDDLE ONE IS DEEMED TO BE DIVIDED.27 BUT THE SAGES RULED: ALL28 IS INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS.24 WHEN29 DO EARTHEN VESSELS BECOME SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS? AS SOON AS THEY ARE BAKED IN THE FURNACE, THAT BEING THE COMPLETION OF THEIR MANUFACTURE.30  

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

   	MISHNAH 2. AS REGARDS A DOUBLE STOVE12 ITS ORIGINAL HEIGHT13 MUST BE NO LESS THAN THREE FINGERBREADTHS AND WHAT IS LEFT OF IT14 THREE FINGERBREADTHS.15 [ITS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO UNCLEANNESS BEGINS] AS SOON AS ITS MANUFACTURE IS COMPLETED.16 WHAT IS REGARDED AS THE COMPLETION OF ITS MANUFACTURE? WHEN IT IS HEATED TO A DEGREE THAT SUFFICES FOR THE COOKING ON IT OF THE LIGHTEST OF EGGS WHEN BROKEN AND PUT IN A SAUCEPAN. AS REGARDS A SINGLE STOVE,17 IF IT WAS MADE FOR BAKING ITS PRESCRIBED SIZE18 IS THE SAME AS THAT FOR A BAKING-OVEN,19 AND IF IT WAS MADE FOR COOKING ITS PRESCRIBED SIZE18 IS THE SAME AS THAT FOR A DOUBLE STOVE.20 A STONE THAT PROJECTS ONE HANDBREADTH FROM A BAKING-OVEN21 OR THREE FINGERBREADTHS FROM A DOUBLE STOVE20 IS CONSIDERED A CONNECTION.22 FOR ONE THAT PROJECTS FROM A SINGLE STOVE, IF THE LATTER WAS MADE FOR BAKING, THE PRESCRIBED SIZE23 IS THE SAME AS THAT FOR A BAKING-OVEN, AND IF IT IS MADE FOR COOKING THE PRESCRIBED SIZE IS THE SAME AS THAT FOR A DOUBLE STOVE. SAID R. JUDAH: THEY24 SPOKE OF A ‘HANDBREADTH’25 ONLY WHERE THE PROJECTION WAS BETWEEN THE OVEN26 AND A WALL.27 IF TWO OVENS WERE ADJACENT TO ONE ANOTHER28 ONE HANDBREADTH23 IS ALLOWED TO THE ONE AND ANOTHER29 TO THE OTHER WHILE THE REMAINDER30 REMAINS CLEAN.31
	MISHNAH 3. THE CROWN32 OF A DOUBLE STOVE IS CLEAN.33 AS TO THE FENDER AROUND AN OVEN, WHEN IT IS FOUR HANDBREADTHS HIGH IT CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT AND THROUGH ITS AIR-SPACE,34 BUT IF IT WAS LOWER IT IS CLEAN.35 IF IT36 WAS JOINED TO IT,37 EVEN IF ONLY BY THREE STONES,38 IT IS UNCLEAN.39 THE SOCKETS [ON THE STOVE]40 FOR THE OIL CRUSE, THE SPICE-POT, AND THE LAMP CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT41 BUT NOT THROUGH THEIR AIR-SPACE;42 SO R. MEIR. R. ISHMAEL43 RULES THAT THEY ARE CLEAN.44

   	MISHNAH 4. AN OVEN THAT WAS HEATED FROM WITHOUT,45 OR ONE THAT WAS HEATED46 WITHOUT THE OWNER'S KNOWLEDGE, OR ONE THAT WAS HEATED WHILE STILL IN THE CRAFTSMAN'S HOUSE47 IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS. IT ONCE HAPPENED THAT A FIRE BROKE OUT AMONG THE OVENS OF KEFAR SIGNAH,48 AND WHEN THE CASE WAS BROUGHT UP AT JABNEH RABBAN GAMALIEL RULED THAT THEY WERE UNCLEAN.49

   	MISHNAH 5. THE CHIMNEY-PIECE50 ON A HOUSEHOLDER'S OVEN IS CLEAN,51 BUT THAT OF BAKERS IS UNCLEAN BECAUSE ONE RESTS ON IT THE ROASTING SPIT.52 R. JOHANAN HASANDELAR53 SAID: BECAUSE ONE BAKES ON IT WHEN PRESSED [FOR SPACE].52 SIMILARLY THE RIM50 OF A BOILER USED BY OLIVE SEETHERS IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS,54 BUT THAT OF ONE USED BY DYERS55 IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE.
   	MISHNAH 6. IF AN OVEN WAS HALF FILLED WITH EARTH,56 THE PART FROM THE EARTH DOWNWARDS CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT ONLY57 WHILE THE PART FROM THE EARTH UPWARDS CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS FROM ITS AIR- SPACE ALSO.58 IF AN OVEN WAS PLACED OVER THE MOUTH OF A CISTERN OR OVER THAT OF A CELLAR AND A STONE WAS INSERTED AT ITS SIDE,59 R. JUDAH RULED: IF WHEN HEATED BELOW60 IT BECOMES ALSO HEATED ABOVE61 IT62 IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS.63 BUT THE SAGES RULED: SINCE IT WAS HEATED, NO MATTER HOW,64 IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS.65

   	MISHNAH 7. IF AN OVEN CONTRACTED UNCLEANNESS HOW IS IT TO BE CLEANSED? IT MUST BE DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS66 AND THE PLASTERING67 MUST BE SCRAPED OFF SO THAT [THE OVEN] TOUCHES THE GROUND.68 R. MEIR RULED: IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SCRAPE OFF THE PLASTERING NOR IS IT NECESSARY FOR [THE OVEN] TO TOUCH THE GROUND, BUT IT69 NEED ONLY BE REDUCED WITHIN70 TO A HEIGHT OF LESS THAN FOUR HANDBREADTHS. R. SIMEON RULED: IT71 MUST ALSO BE MOVED [FROM ITS POSITION]. IF IT WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS, ONE LARGE AND THE OTHER SMALL, THE LARGER REMAINS UNCLEAN AND THE SMALLER BECOMES CLEAN. IF IT WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS THE OTHER TWO TOGETHER, THE BIG ONE REMAINS UNCLEAN AND THE TWO SMALL ONES BECOME CLEAN.
MISHNAH 8. IF AN OVEN WAS CUT UP BREADTHWISE INTO RINGS THAT ARE EACH LESS THAN FOUR HANDBREADTHS IN HEIGHT, IT IS CLEAN. IF IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY72 PLASTERED OVER WITH CLAY, IT BECOMES SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS WHEN73 IT IS HEATED TO A DEGREE THAT SUFFICES FOR THE BAKING OF SPONGY CAKES. IF THE PLASTERING WAS REMOVED,74 AND SAND OR GRAVEL WAS PUT BETWEEN IT AND THE OVEN SIDES — OF SUCH AN OVEN IT HAS BEEN SAID, ‘A MENSTRUANT AS WELL AS A CLEAN WOMAN MAY BAKE IN IT AND IT REMAINS CLEAN’.75

   	MISHNAH 9. IF AN OVEN CAME IN SECTIONS76 FROM THE CRAFTSMAN'S HOUSE AND HOOPS WERE PREPARED FOR IT AND PUT UPON IT77 WHILE IT WAS CLEAN, AND WHEN78 IT CONTRACTED AN UNCLEANNESS ITS HOOPS WERE REMOVED, IT IS AGAIN CLEAN.79 EVEN IF THEY ARE PUT ON AGAIN THE OVEN REMAINS CLEAN.80 IF, HOWEVER, IT WAS81 PLASTERED WITH CLAY, IT BECOMES SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS AND THERE IS NO NEED TO HEAT IT SINCE IT82 WAS ONCE HEATED.

   	MISHNAH 10. IF AN OVEN WAS CUT UP83 INTO RINGS, AND SAND WAS INSERTED BETWEEN EACH PAIR OF RINGS,84 R. ELIEZER RULES: IT IS CLEAN;85 BUT THE SAGES RULE: IT IS UNCLEAN.86 SUCH AN OVEN IS KNOWN AS THE OVEN OF AKNAI.87 AS REGARDS THE ARABIAN POTS, WHICH ARE HOLES DUG IN THE GROUND AND PLASTERED WITH CLAY, IF THE PLASTERING CAN STAND OF ITSELF IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS;88 OTHERWISE IT IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE. AND THIS KIND OF OVEN IS KNOWN AS THE OVEN OF BEN DINAI.89
MISHNAH 11. AN OVEN OF STONE OR OF METAL IS CLEAN,90 BUT THE LATTER IS UNCLEAN AS A METAL VESSEL.91 IF A HOLE WAS MADE IN IT, OR IF IT WAS DAMAGED OR CRACKED, AND IT WAS PROVIDED WITH A LINING OF PLASTER OR WITH A RIM OF CLAY, IT IS UNCLEAN.92 WHAT MUST BE THE SIZE OF THE HOLE?93 IT MUST BE BIG ENOUGH FOR THE FLAME TO COME THROUGH. THE SAME APPLIES ALSO TO A STOVE. A STOVE OF STONE OR OF METAL IS CLEAN,94 BUT THE LATTER IS UNCLEAN AS A METAL VESSEL.95 IF A HOLE WAS MADE IN IT OR IF IT WAS DAMAGED OR CRACKED BUT WAS PROVIDED WITH PROPS96 IT IS UNCLEAN. IF IT WAS LINED WITH CLAY, WHETHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE, IT REMAINS CLEAN. R. JUDAH RULED: IF [THE LINING WAS] INSIDE IT IS UNCLEAN BUT IF OUTSIDE IT REMAINS CLEAN.  
MISHNAH 1. IF THREE PROPS1 WERE PUT UPON THE GROUND2 AND JOINED TOGETHER WITH CLAY3 SO THAT A POT COULD BE SET ON THEM, [THE STRUCTURE] IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS.4 IF THREE NAILS WERE FIXED IN THE GROUND2 SO THAT A POT COULD BE SET ON THEM, EVEN THOUGH A PLACE WAS MADE ON THE TOP5 WHEREON A POT COULD REST, [THE STRUCTURE] IS INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS.6 IF ONE MADE A STOVE OF TWO STONES, JOINING THEM TOGETHER WITH CLAY, IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS.4 R. JUDAH RULES THAT IT IS INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS,7 UNLESS A THIRD STONE IS ADDED OR [THE STRUCTURE] IS PLACED NEAR A WALL.8 IF ONE STONE WAS JOINED TO THE OTHER WITH CLAY AND THE THIRD WAS NOT JOINED TO IT WITH CLAY, [THE STRUCTURE] IS INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS.9

   	MISHNAH 2. A STONE10 ON WHICH A POT IS SET, [RESTING IT ON IT] AND ON AN OVEN, OR ON A DOUBLE STOVE, OR ON A STOVE,11 IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS. IF THE POT RESTED ON THE STONE10 AND ON ANOTHER STONE,12 ON A ROCK13 OR ON A WALL,14 [SUCH STOVE] IS INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS;15 AND SUCH16 WAS THE STOVE OF THE NAZIRITES IN JERUSALEM17 WHICH WAS SET UP AGAINST A ROCK. AS REGARDS THE STOVE OF THE BUTCHERS,18 WHENEVER THE STONES ARE PLACED SIDE BY SIDE,19 IF ONE OF THE STOVES CONTRACTED UNCLEANNESS ALL THE OTHERS DO NOT BECOME UNCLEAN.20
MISHNAH 3. IF ONE MADE OF THREE STONES TWO STOVES21 AND ONE OF THE OUTER ONES CONTRACTED AN UNCLEANNESS THE HALF OF THE MIDDLE ONE THAT SERVES THE UNCLEAN ONE22 IS UNCLEAN BUT THE HALF OF IT THAT SERVES THE CLEAN ONE REMAINS CLEAN. IF THE CLEAN ONE WAS REMOVED, THE MIDDLE ONE IS REGARDED AS COMPLETELY TRANSFERRED TO THE UNCLEAN ONE.23 IF THE UNCLEAN ONE WAS REMOVED, THE MIDDLE ONE IS REGARDED AS COMPLETELY TRANSFERRED TO THE CLEAN ONE. SHOULD THE TWO OUTER ONES CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS, IF THE MIDDLE STONE WAS LARGE EACH OUTER STONE IS ALLOWED SUCH A PART OF IT AS SUFFICES FOR THE SUPPORT OF A POT22 AND THE REMAINDER IS CLEAN. BUT IF IT WAS SMALL ALL OF IT IS UNCLEAN. SHOULD THE MIDDLE STONE BE REMOVED, IF A BIG KETTLE CAN BE SET ON THE TWO OUTER STONES24 THEY ARE UNCLEAN. IF THE MIDDLE STONE IS RESTORED ALL BECOMES CLEAN AGAIN.25 IF IT WAS PLASTERED WITH CLAY26 IT BECOMES SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS WHEN27 IT IS HEATED TO A DEGREE THAT SUFFICES FOR THE COOKING OF AN EGG.28

   	MISHNAH 4. IF TWO STONES WERE MADE INTO A STOVE AND THEY CONTRACTED AN UNCLEANNESS, AND A STONE WAS SET UP NEAR THE OUTER SIDE29 OF THE ONE AND ANOTHER STONE NEAR THE OUTER SIDE OF THE OTHER,30 [THE INNER HALF] OF EACH [INNER STONES]31 REMAINS UNCLEAN32 WHILE [THE OUTER] HALF OF EACH [OF THESE STONES]33 IS CLEAN. IF THE CLEAN STONES34 ARE REMOVED THE OTHERS35 REVERT TO THEIR UNCLEANNESS.  
MISHNAH 1. IF A DOMESTIC1 FIRE-BASKET2 WAS HOLLOWED OUT3 TO A DEPTH OF LESS THAN THREE HANDBREADTHS,4 IT REMAINS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS, BECAUSE WHEN IT IS HEATED FROM BELOW3 A POT ABOVE WOULD STILL BOIL. IF, HOWEVER, IT WAS HOLLOWED OUT3 TO A LOWER DEPTH IT IS INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS.5 IF SUBSEQUENTLY A STONE OR GRAVEL WAS PUT INTO IT,6 IT IS STILL INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS.7 IF IT WAS PLASTERED OVER8 WITH CLAY, IT MAY CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS HENCEFORWARD.9 THIS WAS R. JUDAH'S REPLY10 IN CONNECTION WITH THE OVEN THAT WAS PLACED OVER THE MOUTH OF A CISTERN OR OVER THAT OF A CELLAR.11

   	MISHNAH 2. A HOB12 THAT HAS A RECEPTACLE FOR POTS13 IS CLEAN AS A STOVE14 BUT UNCLEAN AS A RECEPTACLE.15 AS TO ITS16 SIDES,17 WHATEVER TOUCHES THEM DOES NOT BECOME UNCLEAN AS IF THE HOB HAD BEEN A STOVE,18 BUT AS REGARDS ITS WIDE SIDE,19 R. MEIR HOLDS IT TO BE CLEAN20 WHILE R. JUDAH HOLDS IT TO BE UNCLEAN.21 THE SAME LAW22 APPLIES ALSO WHERE A BASKET WAS INVERTED AND A STOVE WAS PUT UPON IT.23

   	MISHNAH 3. IF A DOUBLE STOVE WAS SPLIT INTO TWO PARTS LONGITUDINALLY IT BECOMES INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS.24 BUT IF CROSSWISE25 IT REMAINS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS. IF A SINGLE STOVE WAS SPLIT INTO TWO PARTS, WHETHER LONGITUDINALLY OR CROSSWISE, IT BECOMES INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS.26 AS TO THE FENDER AROUND A STOVE,27 WHENEVER IT28 IS THREE FINGERBREADTHS HIGH IT CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT AND ALSO THROUGH ITS AIR-SPACE, BUT IF IT IS LESS IT CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS THROUGH CONTACT AND NOT THROUGH ITS AIR- SPACE.29 HOW30 IS THE AIR-SPACE31 DETERMINED?32 R. ISHMAEL SAYS: A SPIT33 IS INCLINED FROM ABOVE34 DOWNWARDS35 AND ALL BELOW IT36 IS THE AIR-SPACE37 THROUGH WHICH UNCLEANNESS IS IMPARTED. R. ELIEZER B. JACOB RULED: IF THE STOVE CONTRACTED UNCLEANNESS THE FENDER38 ALSO BECOMES UNCLEAN, BUT IF THE FENDER CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS THE STOVE DOES NOT BECOME UNCLEAN.
ISHNAH 4. IF THE FENDER WAS DETACHED FROM THE STOVE, WHENEVER IT WAS THREE FINGERBREADTHS HIGH IT CONTRACTS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT AND THROUGH ITS AIR-SPACE, BUT IF IT WAS LOWER OR IF THE FENDER WAS FLAT39 IT IS CLEAN.40 IF THREE PROPS41 ON A STOVE WERE THREE FINGERBREADTHS HIGH, THEY CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT AND THROUGH THEIR AIR-SPACE. IF THEY WERE LOWER THEY CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS ALL THE MORE,42 EVEN WHERE THEY WERE FOUR IN NUMBER.43

   	MISHNAH 5. IF ONE OF THEM44 WAS REMOVED, THE REMAINING ONES CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT BUT NOT THROUGH THEIR AIR-SPACE;45 SO R. MEIR. R. SIMEON RULES THAT THEY REMAIN CLEAN. IF ORIGINALLY ONLY TWO PROPS WERE MADE, ONE OPPOSITE THE OTHER,46 THEY CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT AND THROUGH THEIR AIR-SPACE; SO R. MEIR. R. SIMEON RULES THAT THEY ARE CLEAN. IF THEY WERE MORE THAN THREE FINGERBREADTHS HIGH, THE PARTS THAT ARE THREE FINGERBREADTHS HIGH AND DOWNWARDS47 CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT AND THROUGH THEIR AIR-SPACE BUT THE PARTS THAT ARE MORE THAN THREE FINGERBREADTHS HIGH CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT AND NOT THROUGH THEIR AIR-SPACE; SO R. MEIR. R. SIMEON RULES THAT THEY48 ARE CLEAN. IF THEY WERE WITHDRAWN FROM THE RIM,49 THE PARTS WHICH ARE WITHIN THREE FINGERBREADTHS49 CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT AND THROUGH THEIR AIR-SPACE, AND THOSE PARTS THAT ARE REMOVED MORE THAN THREE FINGERBREADTHS49 CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT BUT NOT THROUGH THEIR AIR-SPACE; SO R. MEIR. R. SIMEON RULES THAT THEY ARE CLEAN.
MISHNAH 6. HOW IS THEIR AIR-SPACE50 MEASURED?51 R. SIMEON B. GAMALIEL SAYS: THE MEASURING-ROD52 IS PLACED BETWEEN THEM,53 AND ANY PART THAT IS OUTSIDE THE MEASURING-ROD IS CLEAN WHILE ANY PART INSIDE THE MEASURING-ROD, INCLUDING THE PLACE OF THE MEASURING-ROD ITSELF, IS UNCLEAN.
