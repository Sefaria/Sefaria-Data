Kelim, Chapter Twenty-Two, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
A table one of whose legs was removed is clean.   
If a second leg was removed it is still clean. 
But if a third was removed it becomes unclean where the owner has the intention of using it.     
Rabbi Yose says: no intention is necessary.     
The same law applies also to the side-board.

Explanation
Section one: If one of a three-legged table's legs is removed, it is no longer functional and therefore it is clean.
Section two: If the second leg is removed it is still clean, because it can still not be used. However, if the third leg is removed, then all that remains is a board. If he intends to use the board without the legs, then it becomes susceptible to impurity.
Section three: Rabbi Yose says that since the board can be used, it is automatically susceptible to impurity. He need not even intend to use it.
Section four: The same debate occurs in reference to a side-board (mentioned also in yesterday's mishnah).
