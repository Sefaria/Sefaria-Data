Kelim, Chapter Twenty-Four, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
There are three different types of leather covers:      
That of barbers is susceptible to midras uncleanness;     
That on which people eat is susceptible to corpse uncleanness.
And that for [spreading out] olives is free from all uncleanness.

Explanation
Section one: The leather cover that barbers use is meant to be sat upon, therefore it is susceptible to midras.
Section two: The leather cover people eat on is not meant for sitting but it is considered a vessel. Therefore, it is susceptible to corpse uncleanness.
Section three: The leather cover used to spread out olives isn't even considered a vessel, and therefore it is pure
