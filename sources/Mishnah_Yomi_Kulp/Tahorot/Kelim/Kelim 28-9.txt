Kelim, Chapter Twenty-Eight, Mishnah Nine

Mishnah Nine
A porter's pad is susceptible to midras uncleanness. 
A wine filter is not susceptible to uncleanness as a seat.     
An old woman's hair-net is susceptible to uncleanness as a seat.     
A prostitute's shirt which is woven like a net is not susceptible to uncleanness.     
A garment made of fishing net is not susceptible to uncleanness, but one made of its bag is susceptible. 
Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: if a garment is made out of a fishing net but is made double it is susceptible to uncleanness.

Explanation
Section one: A porter's pad is what the porter places on his back to help him carry his load. Since he sometimes sits on it while resting, it is susceptible to midras impurity. 
Section two: People donâ€™t sit on wine filters, so they are not susceptible to uncleanness as seats.
Section three: An old woman might sit occasionally on her hair net. Therefore, it is susceptible to uncleanness as a seat. Note that this mishnah disagrees with a mishnah that we learned in 24:16.
Section four: A prostitute's shirt is not considered clothing. I guess it was simply too revealing. Therefore, it is not susceptible to uncleanness, just as her hair covering is not susceptible (see 24:16).
Section five: The garment made of fishing net is not substantial enough to count as clothing, therefore it is not susceptible. But the bag at the bottom (see 23:5) is closed and therefore if one makes a garment out of it, the garment is susceptible.
Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says that if the fishing net is doubled over, then it too is substantial enough for a garment made of it to be susceptible.
