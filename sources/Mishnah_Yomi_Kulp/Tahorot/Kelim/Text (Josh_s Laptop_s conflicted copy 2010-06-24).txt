Mishna - Mas. Kelim Chapter 1

MISHNAH 1. THE FATHERS OF UNCLEANNESS1 ARE A [DEAD] CREEPING THING,2 SEMEN VIRILE, [AN ISRAELITE] WHO HAS CONTRACTED CORPSE UNCLEANNESS, A LEPER DURING THE DAYS OF HIS COUNTING3 AND THE WATERS OF PURIFlcation4 WHOSE QUANTITY IS LESS THAN THE MINIMUM PRESCRIBED FOR SPRINKLING.5 BEHOLD, THESE CONVEY UNCLEANNESS TO MEN AND VESSELS BY CONTACT AND TO EARTHENWARE BY PRESENCE WITHIN THEIR AIRSPACE,6 BUT7 THEY CANNOT CONVEY UNCLEANNESS BY CARRIAGE.

   	MISHNAH 2. ON A HIGHER PLANE8 THAN THESE9 ARE CARRION AND WATERS OF PURIFICATION WHOSE QUANTITY IS SUFFICIENT TO BE SPRINKLED, FOR THESE CONVEY UNCLEANNESS TO MAN BY CARRIAGE,10 SO THAT HE IN TURN11 CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS TO CLOTHING BY CONTACT.12 CLOTHING, HOWEVER,13 IS FREE FROM UNCLEANNESS WHERE THERE WAS14 CONTACT ALONE.15

   	MISHNAH 3. ON A HIGHER PLANE16 IS THE MAN WHO HAD INTERCOURSE WITH A MENSTRUANT, FOR HE CONVEYS TO THAT ON WHICH HE LIES17 THE SAME UNCLEANNESS AS [A ZAB18 CONVEYS] TO THAT19 WHICH LIES ABOVE HIM.20 ON A HIGHER PLANE16 THAN THESE ARE THE ISSUE OF A ZAB, HIS SPITTLE, HIS SEMEN AND HIS URINE, AND THE BLOOD OF A MENSTRUANT, FOR THEY CONVEY UNCLEANNESS21 BOTH BY CONTACT AND BY CARRIAGE.22 ON A HIGHER PLANE16 THAN THESE IS AN OBJECT ON WHICH ONE CAN RIDE,23 FOR IT CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS EVEN WHEN IT LIES UNDER A HEAVY STONE.24 ON A HIGHER PLANE16 THAN THE OBJECT ON WHICH ONE CAN RIDE IS THAT ON WHICH ONE CAN LIE, FOR IN THE LATTER CASE UNCLEANNESS25 IS CONVEYED BY CONTACT AS BY CARRIAGE.26 ON A HIGHER PLANE16 THAN THE OBJECT ON WHICH ONE CAN LIE IS THE ZAB, FOR A ZAB CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS TO THE OBJECT ON WHICH HE LIES27 WHILE THE OBJECT ON WHICH HE LIES28 CANNOT CONVEY THE SAME UNCLEANNESS23 TO THAT UPON WHICH IT LIES.29
MISHNAH 4. ON A HIGHER PLANE16 THAN THE ZAB IS THE ZABAH,30 FOR SHE CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS31 TO THE MAN WHO HAS INTERCOURSE WITH HER.32 ON A HIGHER PLANE THAN THE ZABAH IS THE LEPER, FOR HE CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS33 BY ENTERING INTO A HOUSE.34 ON A HIGHER PLANE THAN THE LEPER IS A BONE35 OF THE SIZE OF A BARLEY GRAIN, FOR IT36 CONVEYS AN UNCLEANNESS OF SEVEN DAYS. MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN ALL THESE IS A CORPSE, FOR IT CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS BY OHEL37 WHEREBY ALL THE OTHERS CONVEY NO UNCLEANNESS.38

   	MISHNAH 5. TEN GRADES OF UNCLEANNESS39 EMANATE FROM MEN: A MAN40 BEFORE THE OFFERING OF HIS OBLIGATORY SACRIFICES41 IS FORBIDDEN TO EAT HOLY THINGS BUT PERMITTED TO EAT TERUMAH AND [SECOND] TITHE. IF HE IS42 A TEBUL YOM43 HE IS FORBIDDEN TO EAT HOLY THINGS AND TERUMAH BUT PERMITTED THE EATING OF [SECOND] TITHE. IF HE42 EMITTED SEMEN44 HE IS FORBIDDEN TO EAT ANY OF THE THREE. IF HE42 HAD INTERCOURSE WITH A MENSTRUANT HE CONVEYS THE SAME UNCLEANNESS TO THAT ON WHICH HE LIES AS [A ZAB CONVEYS] TO THAT WHICH LIES ABOVE HIM.45 IF HE IS42 A ZAB WHO HAS OBSERVED TWO DISCHARGES HE CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS TO THAT ON WHICH HE LIES OR SITS AND IS REQUIRED TO UNDERGO IMMERSION IN RUNNING WATER,46 BUT IS EXEMPT FROM THE SACRIFICE.47 IF HE OBSERVED THREE DISCHARGES HE MUST BRING THE SACRIFICE.48 IF HE49 IS A LEPER THAT WAS ONLY SHUT UP50 HE CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS51 BY ENTRY52 BUT IS EXEMPT FROM LOOSENING HIS HAIR,53 FROM RENDING HIS CLOTHES,53 FROM SHAVING54 AND FROM THE BIRDS OFFERING;55 BUT IF HE WAS A CONFIRMED LEPER56 , HE IS LIABLE TO ALL THESE. IF A LIMB ON WHICH THERE WAS NOT THE PROPER QUANTITY OF FLESH57 WAS SEVERED FROM A PERSON, IT CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT AND BY CARRIAGE BUT NOT BY OHEL; BUT IF IT BEARS THE PROPER QUANTITY OF FLESH IT CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS BY CONTACT, BY CARRIAGE AND BY OHEL. A ‘PROPER QUANTITY OF FLESH’ IS SUCH AS IS CAPABLE OF HEALING. R. JUDAH EXPLAINED: IF IN ONE PLACE IT58 HAS FLESH SUFFICIENT TO SURROUND IT58 WITH [THE THICKNESS OF] A THREAD OF THE WOOF59 IT IS CAPABLE OF HEALING.
MISHNAH 6. THERE ARE TEN GRADES OF HOLINESS: THE LAND OF ISRAEL IS HOLIER THAN ALL OTHER LANDS. AND WHAT IS THE NATURE OF ITS HOLINESS? THAT FROM IT ARE BROUGHT THE ‘OMER,60 THE FIRSTFRUITS61 AND THE TWO LOAVES,62 WHICH MAY NOT BE BROUGHT FROM ANY OF THE OTHER LANDS.

   	MISHNAH 7. CITIES63 THAT ARE WALLED64 ARE HOLIER,65 FOR LEPERS MUST BE SENT OUT OF THEM AND A CORPSE, THOUGH IT MAY BE CARRIED ABOUT WITHIN THEM AS LONG AS IT IS DESIRED,66 MAY NOT BE BROUGHT BACK ONCE IT HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT.

   	MISHNAH 8. THE AREA WITHIN THE WALL67 IS HOLIER, FOR IT IS THERE68 THAT HOLY THINGS OF A MINOR DEGREE AND SECOND TITHE MAY BE EATEN. THE TEMPLE MOUNT69 IS HOLler, FOR NEITHER ZABS NOR ZABAHS NOR MENSTRUANTS NOR WOMEN AFTER CHILDBIRTH MAY ENTER IT. THE RAMPART70 IS HOLIER, FOR NEITHER IDOLATERS NOR ONE WHO CONTRACTED CORPSE UNCLEANNESS MAY ENTER IT. THE COURT OF WOMEN71 IS HOLIER, FOR NO TEBUL YOM72 MAY ENTER IT, THOUGH NO SIN-OFFERING IS THEREBY INCURRED. THE COURT OF THE ISRAELITES73 IS HOLIER, FOR A MAN WHO HAS NOT YET OFFERED HIS OBLIGATORY SACRIFICES74 MAY NOT ENTER IT, AND IF HE ENTERS HE INCURS THEREBY A SIN-OFFERING. THE COURT OF THE PRIESTS75 IS HOLIER, FOR NO ISRAELITES MAY ENTER IT EXCEPT WHEN THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO SO76 IN CONNECTION WITH THE LAYING ON OF HANDS,77 SLAYING OR WAVING.78
MISHNAH 9. THE AREA BETWEEN THE ULAM79 AND THE ALTAR IS HOLIER,80 FOR MEN AFFLICTED WITH BLEMISHES OR WITH A WILD GROWTH OF HAIR MAY NOT ENTER IT. THE HEKAL IS HOLIER, FOR NO ONE WHOSE HANDS OR FEET ARE UNWASHED MAY ENTER IT. THE HOLY OF HOLIES IS HOLler, FOR ONLY THE HIGH PRIEST, ON THE DAY OF ATONEMENT, AT THE SERVICE,81 MAY ENTER IT.82 R. JOSE STATED: IN FIVE RESPECTS IS THE AREA BETWEEN THE ULAM AND THE ALTAR ON A PAR WITH THE HEKAL, FOR THOSE AFFLICTED WITH BLEMISHES OR WITH A WILD GROWTH OF HAIR, OR WHO HAVE DRUNK WINE OR WHOSE HANDS OR FEET ARE UNWASHED MAY NOT ENTER THERE,83 AND THE PEOPLE MUST KEEP AWAY FROM THE AREA BETWEEN THE ULAM AND THE ALTAR84 WHEN THE INCENSE IS BEING BURNED.85  
MISHNAH 1. VESSELS OF WOOD, VESSELS OF LEATHER, VESSELS OF BONE OR VESSELS OF GLASS THAT ARE FLAT ARE CLEAN1 AND THOSE THAT FORM A RECEPTACLE ARE UNCLEAN.2 IF THEY WERE BROKEN THEY BECOME CLEAN1 AGAIN. IF ONE REMADE THEM INTO VESSELS THEY ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS HENCEFORTH.3 EARTHEN VESSELS AND VESSELS OF ALUM- CRYSTALS ARE ON A PAR IN RESPECT OF UNCLEANNESS: THEY CONTRACT AND CONVEY4 UNCLEANNESS THROUGH THEIR AIR-SPACE,5 THEY CONTRACT UNCLEANNESS6 THROUGH THEIR [CONCAVE] BOTTOMS BUT NOT7 THROUGH THEIR BACKS;8 AND WHEN BROKEN9 THEY BECOME CLEAN.1
MISHNAH 2. AS REGARDS THE SMALLEST EARTHEN VESSELS, AND THE BOTTOMS AND SIDES [OF THE LARGER BUT BROKEN VESSELS] THAT CAN STAND10 UNSUPPORTED,11 THE PRESCRIBED SIZE12 IS A CAPACITY TO HOLD OIL SUFFICIENT FOR THE ANOINTING OF A LITTLE FINGER OF A CHILD IF13 THEIR FORMER CAPACITY14 WAS THAT OF15 A LOG. IF13 THEIR FORMER CAPACITY14 WAS FROM ONE LOG TO SE'AH THEIR PRESENT CAPACITY12 MUST BE A QUARTER OF A LOG; IF IT WAS14 FROM A SE'AH TO TWO SE'AH IT MUST BE16 HALF A LOG; IF17 FROM TWO SE'AH TO THREE SE'AH OR AS MUCH AS FIVE SE'AH IT MUST BE18 A LOG; SO R. ISHMAEL. R. AKIBA STATED: I DO NOT PRESCRIBE ANY SIZE FOR THE UNBROKEN VESSELS,19 BUT20 THIS IS THE RULE: AS REGARDS THE SMALLEST EARTHEN VESSELS, AND THE BOTTOMS AND SIDES [OF LARGER BUT BROKEN ONES] THAT CAN STAND21 UNSUPPORTED,22 THE PRESCRIBED SIZE23 IS A CAPACITY TO HOLD ENOUGH OIL TO ANOINT THE LITTLE FINGER OF A CHILD. [THIS SIZE IS PRESCRIBED FOR POTS] THAT ARE NOT BIGGER THAN24 THE SMALL COOKING-POTS. FOR SMALL COOKING-POTS AND FOR THOSE BETWEEN THESE AND THE LYDDA JARS THE PRESCRIBED CAPACITY23 IS A QUARTER OF A LOG. FOR THOSE WHICH HAVE A SIZE BETWEEN THAT OF LYDDA JARS AND THE BETHLEHEM JARS THE CAPACITY23 MUST BE THAT OF HALF A LOG. FOR THOSE BETWEEN THE BETHLEHEM JARS AND LARGE STONE JARS THE CAPACITY23 MUST BE THAT OF A LOG. R. JOHANAN B. ZAKKAI RULED: THE PRESCRIBED CAPACITY23 FOR THE FRAGMENTS OF LARGE STONE JARS IS TWO LOGS, AND THAT FOR THE BOTTOMS OF BROKEN GALILEAN CRUSES AND SMALL JARS IS ANY WHATSOEVER, BUT THE FRAGMENTS OF THEIR SIDES ARE IN NO CASE SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS
MISHNAH 3. THE FOLLOWING25 ARE NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS AMONG EARTHEN VESSELS: A TRAY WITHOUT A RIM, A FIRE-PAN WITH BROKEN SIDES, A TUBE FOR ROASTING CORN, GUTTERS EVEN IF THEY ARE BENT26 AND EVEN IF THEY HAVE27 SOME FORM OF RECEPTACLE,28 A BASKET-COVER29 THAT WAS TURNED INTO A BREAD-BASKET,26 A PITCHER30 THAT HAS BEEN ADAPTED31 AS A COVER FOR GRAPES,32 A JAR30 FOR SWIMMERS,33 A SMALL JAR30 FIXED TO THE SIDES OF A LADLE,34 A BED, A STOOL, A BENCH, A TABLE, A SHIP,35 AND AN EARTHEN LAMP, BEHOLD THESE ARE INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS. THE FOLLOWING IS A GENERAL RULE:36 ANY AMONG EARTHEN VESSELS THAT HAS NO INNER PART IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS ON ITS OUTER SIDES.37

   	MISHNAH 4. A LANTERN THAT HAS A RECEPTACLE FOR OIL IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS, BUT ONE THAT HAS NONE IS INSUSCEPTIBLE. A POTTER'S MOULD ON WHICH ONE BEGINS TO SHAPE THE CLAY IS INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS,38 BUT THAT ON WHICH ONE FINISHES IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE.39 A FUNNEL FOR HOME USE40 IS INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS,38 BUT THAT OF PEDLARS IS SUSCEPTIBLE BECAUSE41 IT ALSO SERVES AS A MEASURE;42 SO R. JUDAH B. BATHYRA. R. AKIBA SAID: BECAUSE ONE PUTS IT ON ITS SIDE43 SO AS TO LET THE BUYER SMELL IT.44

   	MISHNAH 5. THE COVERS OF WINE JARS AND OIL JARS AND THE COVERS OF PAPYRUS45 JARS46 ARE INSUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS, BUT IF THEY WERE ADAPTED FOR USE AS RECEPTACLES THEY ARE SUSCEPTIBLE. THE COVER OF A STEW-POT IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCLEANNESS WHEN IT HAS A HOLE47 OR A POINTED TOP,48 BUT IF IT HAS NEITHER HOLE NOR POINTED TOP IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE BECAUSE SHE49 DRAINS THE VEGETABLES INTO IT. R. ELIEZER B. ZADOK SAID: BECAUSE SHE TURNS OUT THE CONTENTS [OF THE POT] ON TO IT.
