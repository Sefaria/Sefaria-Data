Kelim, Chapter Fifteen, Mishnah Five

Introduction
The general rule expressed in section three summarizes this halakhah well. A shovel is susceptible to impurity if it is used to hold things, even temporarily. This is enough to fill the requirement that the vessel have a receptacle.
However, if the shovel is used only to move things around, then it is clean because it is not considered to have a receptacle. 
The rest of the mishnah is straightforward, so there is no commentary below. 

Mishnah Five
The grist-dealersâ€™ shovel is susceptible to impurity but the one used in grain stores is clean. 
The one used in wine- presses is susceptible to impurity but that used in threshing- floors is clean. 
This is the general rule: [a shovel] that is intended to hold anything is susceptible to impurity but one intended only to heap stuff together is clean.
