Kelim, Chapter Twenty-Nine, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with the susceptibility to impurity of a hair-net.

Mishnah Ten
A hair-net that one began to make from its upper hem remains pure until its bottom section is finished.
If one began from its bottom section, it remains pure until its hem is finished. 
Its head band is susceptible to uncleanness in itself.     
Its strings are susceptible to uncleanness because they are connected.     
A hair-net that is torn becomes pure if it cannot contain the greater part of the hair. 

Explanation
Section one: When making a hair-net, it is not considered completed until both the top hem and bottom hem are finished, and it doesn't matter whether one begins to sew from top to bottom or bottom to top.
Section two: The head band is considered a vessel independent of the rest of the hair-net and therefore is susceptible even if separate. Furthermore, it is not considered connected to the head band and if it is impure, the hair-net can still be pure.
Section three: The strings which come out of the hair-net are considered connected, because they cannot be removed. Therefore, if the hair-net is impure, the strings are impure as well.
Section four: Once the hair-net is torn enough such that it cannot contain the greater part of the hair, it is no longer functional and it is not susceptible to impurity.
