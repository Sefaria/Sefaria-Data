Ohalot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
The following bring [impurity] but do not protect against it: 
A chest, a box, a cupboard, a beehive of straw, a beehive of reeds, or the water tank of an Alexandrian ship, such of which [objects] have [flat] bottoms but cannot contain forty se'ahs of liquid measure or two kors dry measure.   
A curtain, a leather apron, a leather undercover, a sheet, a matting underlay or a mat when not made into tents.
Cattle or wild animals when they are dead, and foodstuffs that are [liable to become] unclean.   
In addition to these, a human-powered mill.

Explanation
Section one: Today's mishnah deals with objects that bring impurity but do not serve as a barrier against it.
Section two: This is the same as the list in mishnah one except the boxes are smaller. Since they cannot contain forty seahs of liquid or two kors of dry goods, they are susceptible to impurity. Things that are susceptible to impurity do not act as barriers to impurity. 
Section three: This is also the same list as in mishnah one except here the curtains are are laying flat over the hatch between an upper story and a bottom floor and they are not set up as a tent. As we learned in 7:2, in such a situation these things can bring impurity, but they do not act as a barrier against it.
Section four: Since these animals or foods are unclean, they do not protect against impurity.
Section five: Hand-mills which can be carried from place to place are susceptible to impurity, and therefore cannot act as a barrier. In contrast, mills operated by animals are heavy and immovable. Therefore they can act as a barrier against impurity.
