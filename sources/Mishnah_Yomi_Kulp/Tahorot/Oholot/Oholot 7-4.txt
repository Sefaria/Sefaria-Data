Ohalot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Today's mishnah deals with a woman who gives birth to a stillborn, but while doing so moves from house to house. The question is: when do we consider her womb to have opened such that the fetus would defile the contents of the house?

Mishnah Four
If a woman was having great difficulty giving birth and they carried her out from one house to another, the first house is doubtfully unclean and the second is certainly unclean. 
Rabbi Judah said: When is this so? When she is carried out [supported] by the armpits, but if she was able to walk, the first house remains clean, for after the "tomb" has been opened there is no possibility of walking, 
For stillborn children are not [deemed to have] opened the "tomb" until they present a head rounded like a spindle-knob.    

Explanation
Section one: The first house is only doubtfully impure, because we don't know if the woman's womb "opened up" there such that the stillborn could defile the house. The second house is certainly impure because that is where she gave birth.
Section two: Rabbi Judah says that if she was able to walk out of the first house on her own, then the first house is certainly not impure because a woman whose womb has opened up cannot walk on her own. The first house is impure only if she was helped out by being carried by the armpits. The mishnah calls the womb a "tomb" probably because in this case, the fetus died there. 
Section three: This section is usually explained as the continuation of Rabbi Judah's words. When he said that once the womb (tomb) has been opened a woman cannot walk, that is only the case if the head is round like a spindle-knob. But if the head is smaller, then a woman might be able to walk around even after the womb-tomb has been opened. In such a case, even if she walked from one house to the other, we would have to be concerned lest the first house is also defiled.
