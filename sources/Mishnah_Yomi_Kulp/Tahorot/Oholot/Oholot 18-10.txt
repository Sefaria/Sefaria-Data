Ohalot, Chapter Eighteen, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
Our mishnah, the final in the tractate (have we really reached the end?), lists places owned by non-Jews that are not considered impure. These places are all for temporary dwelling and therefore there is no assumption that fetuses would have been buried there. 

Mishnah Ten
Ten places are not [subject to the laws] of non-Jewish dwelling-places: 
Arabs’ tents,   
Field-huts (sukkot), 
Triangular field-huts, 
Fruit-shelters,   
Summer shelters,   
A gate-house, 
The open spaces of a courtyard, 
A bath-house, 
An armory,   
And the place where the legions [camp].  

Congratulations! We have completed Tractate Ohalot!
Another long and difficult tractate under our belts—congrats!
As I always write, it is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives.
Ohalot is a complicated tractate, one which deals with one of the most important topics with regard to the purity laws—the impurity transmitted by a corpse. Corpse impurity is far and away the most serious of the forms of impurity and it is the only type of impurity that is conveyed through overshadowing. Through the topic of ohalot we also have had a glimpse into how the rabbinic thought process can work, expanding the concrete verse, "When a person dies in a tent" mentioned in the Torah, to the abstract notion of the rabbinic ohel, which refers to certain types of things that "overhang." Indeed, according to one opinion, even a person's body can be an ohel!
Tomorrow our learning continues with Tractate Negaim. Good luck to everyone and congratulations on your amazing commitment to learning.
