Ohalot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five 
When do these rules apply? When the mouth [of the hive is pointing] outwards
If the mouth is [pointing] inwards [towards the house]: 
If an olive-sized portion of the corpse is placed below or above [that part of the hive which is] outside, everything directly below or above that olive-sized portion becomes unclean, and everything not directly [below or above it] and whatever is within [the hive] and the house, remains clean. 
[If the uncleanness is] within the hive or the house, everything becomes unclean.

Explanation
Section one: Our mishnah changes the scenario that we have been examining from mishnayot 1-4 so that the mouth of the hive is open inwards towards the house instead of to the outside. The mishnah now goes through all of the scenarios that we have already seen in the first four mishnayot. Instead of referring the reader to these mishnayot, for ease of reference, when the rules are the same, I have copied the commentary from there.
Section two: The hive is totally blocking the house, with the opening of the hive facing inward. If impurity is found above or below, it will defile anything that is directly above or below it, but it won't spread to the sides because it is not in an ohel. It also does not defile inside the hive because the hive is not susceptible to impurity (see mishnah one).
Section three: If the uncleanness is within the hive everything is impure, meaning anything found in the hive, on top or below the hive or in the house. While the hive does not act as an ohel to block the impurity but it does bring the impurity. This was stated explicitly in 8:3, where the mishnah listed things that bring impurity but do not block against it.
