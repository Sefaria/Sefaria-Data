Ohalot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Ten

Mishnah Ten
If it was standing upright in the doorway and there was not a space of one handbreadth between it and the lintel: 
If there is uncleanness within it, the house remains clean.
But if there is uncleanness in the house, what is within [the hive] becomes unclean,   for the manner of the uncleanness is to go out and not to go in.    

Explanation
Section one: In this scenario, the hive is standing upright in the doorway, and there is no significant space between the lintel and the opening of the hive.
Section two: If there is uncleanness inside the hive, it protects it from going out and defiling the contents of the house. 
Section three: However, if there is uncleanness inside the house, it will go out the door and travel through the hive on its way. Therefore, the contents of the hive will be defiled. This is similar to the situation in 4:3â€”see there for a comparison.
