Ohalot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
A house serving a wall is subject to the principle of garlic-skin. 
How so? [In the case of] a wall between two tomb-niches or two caverns, 
If there is uncleanness in them and vessels in the walls, and there is a covering thin as garlic-skin over them, they remain clean. 
If the uncleanness is in the wall and the vessels are in them, and there is a covering thin as garlic-skin over the uncleanness, they remain clean. 
If there is uncleanness beneath a pillar, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards.  

Explanation
Section one: Today's mishnah deals with a case where some sort of natural wall, such as a wall of rocks in the ground, existed before the building of the house adjacent to it. This is different from a case in which a wall was built in order to serve a house, a case discussed in mishnah three.
Section two: The wall described here exists between two structures hewn in the ground, either two tomb-niches, places in which people used to bury the dead, or two caverns. 
Section three: If there is a source of uncleanness in one of these places, and there are vessels in the wall, even a covering as thin as the skin of garlic will protect them from becoming unclean. Note that if this was a wall built to be part of a house, the vessels would be impure. Since this wall was not built to be part of the house, as long as it is separate, the contents found inside the wall are not actually part of the house.
Section four: The same is true in the opposite case, when the source of impurity is found in the wall and the vessels are in the tomb-niches or in the caverns.
Section five: If there is a source of uncleanness beneath a pillar it spreads up and down so that anything inside the pillar or on top of it or buried further beneath it is impure. However, it does not defile things found on the side because the pillar is not like a wall serving to close in another structure.
