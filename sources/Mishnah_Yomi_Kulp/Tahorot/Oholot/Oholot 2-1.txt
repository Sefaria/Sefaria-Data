Ohalot, Chapter Two, Mishnah One

Introduction
Our mishnah lists what things cause impurity through overshadowing (an ohel). These things defile even if they are not touched or are not carried.
Below I have explained only terms that are not clear through translation.

Mishnah One
These things defile by overshadowing: 
a corpse,  
an olive-sized [portion of flesh] of a corpse, 
an olive-sized [portion] of nezel, 
a ladleful of corpse-mold,  
the spine or the skull,  
[a] full limb of a corpse, or [a full] limb [severed] from a living person with the appropriate amount of flesh, 
a quarter  [of a kav] of bones from the structural majority  or numerical majority, 
and the structural majority or numerical majority [of the bones] of a corpse even though they do not amount to a quarter [of a kab]; 
[all these] are unclean. 
How many [bones] form the numerical majority? One hundred and twenty-five. 

Explanation
c) Nezel refers to flesh from a corpse that has begun to decompose. It can also refer to liquid that was emitted from the dead body that has begun to congeal. Hope you're not reading this while eating! 
d) Corpse-mold is a later stage of decomposition. The amount required to defile is greater than that for regular flesh or nezel. 
e) The spine or the skull causes impurity even if there is no flesh on it. 
g + h) Bones can cause impurity even without the flesh on them as long as one of two requirements is met. 1) There is a quarter kav (about half of a liter) of bones collected from the structural or numerical majority of the body. The "structural majority" refers to the large leg bones, the ribs and the spine. In other words, it doesn't include most of the smaller bones. 2) The structural or numerical majority is actually present, even if there is not a quantity of a quarter of a kav of bones.
Section two: The mishnah assumes you're not too good at math, so it lets you know that a majority of 248 is 125. Thanks!
