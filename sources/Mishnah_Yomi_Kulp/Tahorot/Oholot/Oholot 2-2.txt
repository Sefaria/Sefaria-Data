Ohalot, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our mishnah continues to list substances that defile through overshadowing. 

Mishnah Two
[The following likewise defile:] 
A quarter [of a log] of blood,   
A quarter [of a log] of mixed blood from one corpse. 
Rabbi Akiva says: [even] from two corpses.   
[With regard to] the blood of a child that has completely flowed forth:
Rabbi Akiva says: [it defiles] in even the smallest quantity,   
But the sages say: [there must be] a quarter [of a log].   
[With regard to] an olive-sized [portion] of [corpse] worms whether alive or dead:
Rabbi Eliezer declares [it] unclean, like the flesh, 
But the sages declare [it] clean. 
[With regard to] the ashes of burnt persons:
Rabbi Eliezer says: the [minimum] quantity [for defilement is] a quarter [of a kav].
But the sages declare [them to be] clean. 
A ladleful and [a little] more of grave-dust is unclean. 
Rabbi Shimon declares [it to be] clean. 
A ladleful of corpse-mold mixed with water is not [regarded as] joined [into one mass] for [the purposes of] defilement.

Explanation
Section one: A quarter of a log is about 1/8 of a liter. Less than half a can of coke, for those of you who drink the stuff (coke, not blood).
Section two: Mixed blood is a mixture of blood from a corpse with blood from a living person (that doesn't defile). If there is a quarter of a log of such blood, it too defiles. 
Rabbi Akiva says that even blood that comes from two different corpses defiles, if there is a minimum mixture.
Section three: A small child does not have nearly as much blood as an adult. Therefore, Rabbi Akiva says that even the smallest quantity of blood will cause impurity. However, the other rabbis do not make such a distinction. There must always be a quarter of a log for it to cause impurity through an ohel. 
Section four: You're going to love this one. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the worms that come and out of a corpse are treated as if they were part of the corpse itself and if there is the minimum amount, they convey impurity like the corpse. 
The other rabbis say that these worms are clean (but you might still want to wash your hands after handling them). 
Section five: Rabbi Eliezer holds that even the ashes of human remains can defile, if there is the same minimum amount as there is of flesh. But the other rabbis disagree. They seem to hold that burning the body obliterates the source of impurity. Perhaps we could even extend this opinion and explain that according to the rabbis burning destroys any of the once-alive spirit that remains in the body (perhaps this is also at least one of the reasons that cremation is prohibited.)
We should also note that Rabbi Eliezer seems to hold what we have deemed elsewhere a "realistic" position. The corpse is found in the worms, therefore they defile. The ashes contain the corpse, therefore they too defile. The rabbis hold more of a "nominalistic" position. The worms are not considered by definition to be a corpse, nor are ashes. 
Section six: In yesterday's mishnah we learned that a ladleful of corpse mold transmits impurity. According to Rabbi Shimon, a ladleful plus a little more of earth taken from under a corpse will contain a ladleful of corpse. Therefore, it transmits impurity.
Section seven: This section contains a special rule concerning a ladleful of corpse mold. The pieces of corpse in such mold are considered to be separate from each other, even if they have been mixed in with water. Therefore, if one touches such mold he is not impure, because he has touched a piece of corpse that is less than an olive's worth. However, the ladleful still transmits impurity through overshadowing and carrying because there is a total amount of corpse sufficient to transmit impurity.
