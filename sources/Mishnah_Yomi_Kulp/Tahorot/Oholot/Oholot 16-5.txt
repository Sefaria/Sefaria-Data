Ohalot, Chapter Sixteen, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
If he was searching and came to a river bed, or a pool or a public road, he may end [his search]. 
A field in which men have been slain, he may gather the bones one by one, and all [the area] may be accounted clean.   
One who removes a grave from his field, he may gather the bones one by one, and all [the area] may be accounted clean. 
A pit into which they throw fetuses or people that had been slain, he may gather the bones one by one, and all [the area] may be accounted clean. 
Rabbi Shimon says: if it had been prepared as a grave in the first place, there is [blood-] saturated earth.   

Explanation
Section one: If one is searching an area of twenty cubits (mishnah three) to see if there are any more dead bodies, and he gets to a river bed, a pool of water or a public road, he can use that landmark as the end of his search because it is obvious that people don't build a cemetery through or in a river bed, a pool or a public road.
Section two: The mishnah now deals with cases where a person need not remove the earth with the bones that he finds. If he finds a field in which people were killed, he can remove just the bones and the area will be clean. He need not remove the earth.
Section three: A person may remove a grave from his field if originally there was a grave outside of his field and the grave broke open into his field. In this case he can also remove the bones without removing the ground.
Section four: Similarly, if one is clearing out a pit into which either fetuses (miscarriages) or dead bodies had been thrown, he need not remove the ground.
From all of this we can see that the rule concerning the removal of the ground applies only if the area was originally designated a burial ground.
Section five: This is confirmed by Rabbi Shimon who says that if the pit was originally designated to be a burial ground, then when he removes it, he must remove the ground as well.
