Ohalot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Eleven

Mishnah Eleven
If it was lying on its side in the open air:
If an olive-sized [portion] of a corpse was placed below it or above it, everything directly below or above the olive-sized [portion] becomes unclean; but everything that is not directly below or above, and what is within [the hive] remains clean.
[If the uncleanness is] within [the hive] everything becomes unclean.  

Explanation
Section one: In this scenario, our beloved hive is outside of the house, so the contents of the house need not worry about being defiled.
Section two: The rules here are exactly the same as in 1-4. If the impurity is above or below the hive, it goes down to the depths and up to the heavens, but it doesn't spread to the side because it is not found in any sort of ohel. See mishnah one.
Section three: But if the impurity is inside the hive, it spreads the impurity around inside, but it doesn't act as an ohel to prevent it from spreading above and below. Thus everything inside, above and below the entire hive will be impure.
