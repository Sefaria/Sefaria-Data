Ohalot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
When do these rules apply? When the hive is a vessel and it is loosely placed in the door.  
If it is defective, although [it may be] stopped up with straw or it is stuck to the side of the door—What is "stuck? Anything which has no opening of one handbreadth—:
Then, if an olive-sized [portion] of a corpse is placed below it, [everything] directly [below the portion] to the depths becomes unclean;   
[If placed] above [the hive everything] directly above to the sky becomes unclean. 
[If the uncleanness is] in the house or in the hive, whatever is in the house or hive becomes unclean.

Explanation
Section one: The rules in the above two mishnayot apply only if the hive is a complete and unbroken vessel and it is loosely placed into the doorway. 
Section two: If the hive is defective, meaning a piece is missing, or it is stuck tightly into the door, then the rules are different. The rest of the mishnah outlines how the impurity spreads if these conditions hold.
Section three: If there is impurity below, the impurity will defile all the way down to the depths, but it will not defile above. Since the hive is not a vessel, it acts as a barrier against the impurity. 
Section four: The same is true if the impurity is above the hive. It will defile anything above it, but the hive acts as a barrier and things that are below are pure. 
Section five: This is where the rule differs from mishnah three. Since the hive is opened to the inside, if there is uncleanness inside the hive or inside the house, it defiles whatever is in either place. Above and below are pure for a broken hive acts as an ohel and prevents the impurity from spreading above and below.
