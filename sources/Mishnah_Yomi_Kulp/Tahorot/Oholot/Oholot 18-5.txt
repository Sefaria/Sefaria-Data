Ohalot, Chapter Eighteen, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Today's mishnah deals with various ways that a bet peras can be purified.

Mishnah Five
How is a bet haperas purified? 
They remove [soil to a depth of] three handbreadths, or [soil to a height of] three handbreadths is placed upon it. 
If they removed [soil from a depth of] three handbreadths from one half [and upon the other half they placed three hand breadths [of soil], it becomes clean. 
Rabbi Shimon says: even they removed one handbreadth and a half and placed upon it one handbreadth and a half from another place, it becomes clean. 
One who paves a bet peras with stones that cannot [easily] be moved, it becomes clean. 
Rabbi Shimon says: even if one digs up [the soil of] a bet peras [and doesnâ€™t find any bones] it becomes clean.

Explanation
Section one: Basically, the way to purify a bet peras is to either remove the top soil or to add new top soil. Each of these must be done to a depth of three handbreadths, which is the depth of soil that a typical plow overturns.
Section two: It is possible to purify half the field by adding topsoil and half the field by removing topsoil.
Section three: Rabbi Shimon is even more lenient. It is possible to remove 1.5 handbreadths of topsoil and then add 1.5 handbreadths of new topsoil. Note that in reality, when he plows he will plow into the old topsoil because the plow goes to a depth of three handbreadths. In other words, Rabbi Shimon's rule is basically a legal fiction. As long as the adding/removing totals up to a sum of 3 handbreadths, it purifies the field.
Section four: If one paves a bet peras with stones, the soil underneath will not be easily moved. Therefore, the field which was a bet peras can be considered pure. 
Section five: According to Rabbi Shimon if one digs up a bet peras and finds no bones, the field is pure, for this is considered the best kind of check possible.
