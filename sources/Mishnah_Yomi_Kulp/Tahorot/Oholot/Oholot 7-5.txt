Ohalot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with a woman who gives birth to twins, one alive and one a stillborn. The question is: does the stillborn defile the live child?

Mishnah Five
If [at the birth of twins] the first came out dead and the second came out alive, the [live one] is clean.   
If the first was alive and the second dead, the [live child] is unclean.   
Rabbi Meir says: if they were in one sac, [the live child] is unclean,  but if there were two sacs, it remains clean.

Explanation
Section one: If a woman gives birth to twins and the first comes out dead, the second is pure because before the womb was opened, the dead fetus does not convey impurity. The live child was not made impure in the womb. 
[Note that they would have had to remove the stillborn from the house before the second child was born, otherwise the live child would be defiled by being in the same house as the dead child.]
Section two: If the first was alive, and then the dead child was born, the live child is impure because once the womb has been opened, the dead child defiles things outside of the womb. Thus as soon as the first child is born, it is immediately defiled.
Section three: Rabbi Meir qualifies the halakhah in section two. It is only correct if both children were in one sac, because in that case, when the womb for the live child has opened, the womb for the stillborn has also opened. But if the two children are in different sacs, then the first child remains clean because the dead child is still sealed in the womb when the first child is born alive.
