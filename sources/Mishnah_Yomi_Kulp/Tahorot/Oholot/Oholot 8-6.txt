Ohalot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
Two [earthenware] jars in which there are two pieces of corpse the size of half an olive, sealed with tightly fitting lids, lying in a house, they remain clean, but the house becomes unclean.
If one of them was opened, that [jar] and the house become unclean, but the other remains clean. 
A similarly with to two rooms that open into a house.   

Explanation
Section one: I bet you read this situation and said to yourself, yes, that's happened to me. Two tightly sealed jars, with two pieces of corpse less than the size of an olive in each, sure, common situation ÔÅä. 
In all seriousness, the tightly sealed jar does not prevent impurity from coming out in an ohel. Since between the two jars there is the necessary olive's worth of corpse, the house is unclean. However, each jar remains clean because a tightly sealed lid prevents impurity from defiling an earthenware jar.
Section two: If one jar was opened, that jar is unclean by virtue of being in the house. However, the other jar remains pure. The house is unclean as it was in section one.
Section three: If there is half of an olive's worth of corpse in each room, and the doors to the house are both locked, they join together to defile the house, because eventually these pieces of corpse will be brought out through the house. However, the rooms themselves remain pure because there is less than an olive's worth in each.
