Niddah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Eleven

Introduction
This mishnah and the next mishnah (10:1) really refer back to 1:7 which teaches that blood of virginity is pure. Today's mishnah compares women to wine, that just as wine has different colors, so too does blood of virginity.

Mishnah Eleven
Women in regard to their virginity are like vines:
One vine may have red wine, while another has black wine. 
One vine may yield much wine while another yields little.  
Rabbi Judah stated: every vine yields wine, and one that yields no wine is but a dorketi.

Explanation
Section one: The mishnah notes that the color of virginal blood and menstrual blood can be either red or black. Either can be pure, if we think it is virginal blood, and either could be impure, if we think it is menstrual blood. 
Section two: Similarly, some women bleed a lot, just like some vines yield a lot of wine. And some bleed little, just like some vines yield little wine.
Section three: Rabbi Judah adds that vines that don't yield wine are "dorketi" which is a Greek word for barren. A woman who does not menstruate will not be able to have children.
