Niddah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Today's mishnah deals with what happens if blood is found on one of the testing-rags after a couple have intercourse.

Mishnah Two
If [blood] is found on his rag they are both unclean and they are liable to bring a sacrifice.   
If any blood is found on her rag immediately after their intercourse, they are both unclean and must bring a sacrifice. 
If [blood] is found on her rag after a time, they are unclean due to doubt but they are exempt from a sacrifice.

Explanation
Section one: If any blood is found on the rag which the man uses to check himself then we can be sure that it came from the woman. They are both unclean for seven days as is the rule for a menstruant and the man who has relations with her (see Leviticus 15:24). In addition, they must both bring a sin-offering, which is the rule for any unintentional transgression which when done intentionally carries with it the penalty of "karet." 
Section two: If blood is found on her rag and it is found immediately after intercourse, then we can be assured that it is menstrual blood that was there during intercourse. Both are impure and liable for a sacrifice.
However, if it is found later on, since she didn't clean herself immediately, then we can't be sure that it was there during intercourse. Perhaps she only began to bleed later. In such a case the man is "doubtfully" impure, which means that if he touched terumah it can't be eaten but it also is not burned because we are not sure he is impure. She is impure in any case. They are exempt from bringing a sin-offering because sin-offerings are not brought unless one is certain of a transgression, and it is not certain that she was menstruating when they had intercourse.
