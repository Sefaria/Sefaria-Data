Niddah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
Whatsoever is subject to tithes is susceptible to food-uncleanness.
But there are foods that are to food-uncleanness and not subject to tithes. 

Explanation
Section one: Only food is subject to tithes and terumah. Therefore, anything that is subject to tithes must be a food.
Section two: However, not all food is subject to tithes and terumah, for instance things that don't grow from the ground (see Maasrot 1:1). Therefore, there can be food that is subject to impurity but not liable for tithes and terumah.
