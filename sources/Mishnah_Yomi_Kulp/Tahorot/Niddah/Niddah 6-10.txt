Niddah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Ten

Mishnah Ten
Whatever requires a blessing after it requires one before it;
But there are things that require a blessing before them and not after them.

Explanation
One must recite a blessing before eating anything, even of the smallest amount. One also must recite a blessing before the performance of a mitzvah. But in both of these cases, there is no blessing recited after. 
However, anything that one blesses after it, such as a sufficient portion of food, one would certainly have to bless before it as well.
