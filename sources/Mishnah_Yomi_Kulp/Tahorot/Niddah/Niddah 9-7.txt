Niddah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Today's mishnah relates to the seven substances used as detergents to remove stains from clothing. 

Mishnah Seven
What is meant by tasteless spittle? From one who had eaten nothing [that day]. 
The liquid of crushed beans? The chewing of split beans, ready to be swallowed. 
Urine? That has fermented. 
One must scour the stain three times with each of the substances. 
If he applied them out of the prescribed order, or if he applied the seven substances simultaneously, he has done nothing. 

Explanation
Section one: The "tasteless spittle" refers to the saliva excreted by a person who had not yet eaten that day.
Section two: The "liquid of crushed beans" refers to beans that have been very well chewed in a person's mouth, so chewed up that the person is ready to swallow them. 
Section three: According to the Tosefta, it takes three days for urine to ferment. Ymm!
Section four: Each of the substances must be applied to the garment three times in the order of the appearance of the substance on the list. If they are not applied three times in the correct order then the stain must be considered blood, even if it didn't disappear.
