Niddah, Chapter Five, Mishnah One

Mishnah One
For a fetus born from its mother's side, she does not sit the prescribed days of uncleanness  nor the days of cleanness, nor does one incur on its account the obligation to bring a sacrifice.  
Rabbi Shimon says: it is regarded as a regular birth. 
All women are subject to uncleanness  [as soon as the blood appears] in the outer chamber, as it says, "her discharge being blood in her body" (Leviticus 15:19).
But a zav and one who emitted semen convey no uncleanness unless the discharge   came out of the body.

Explanation
Section one: A fetus born from its mother's side is one born through a caesarean section. I am not sure how frequently a mother would even live through such an operation in the ancient world, but if she did, she is not impure (1 week for a male or two weeks for a female) nor does she have any days in which discharged blood is pure. Basically, if the child is not born in the normal way, it is not considered a birth and the purity rules relevant to childbirth do not apply.
Rabbi Shimon disagrees and says that a caesarean section is considered a normal birth.
Section two: A woman (niddah or zavah) is impure as soon as the blood reaches the outer chamber, which I assume means the vagina. The blood need not flow out for her to be impure. This is midrashically read into the word "in her body."  In contrast, men are impure only when the semen or other discharge has left the penis.
