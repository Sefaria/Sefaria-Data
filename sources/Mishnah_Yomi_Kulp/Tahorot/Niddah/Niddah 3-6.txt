Niddah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
If a woman miscarried and it is unknown what it was, she sits for both a male child and a female child.   
If it is unknown whether it was a child or not, she sits for both a male and a female   and as a menstruant.  

Explanation
Section one: This is the same rule we have learned in previous mishnayot. 
Section two: In this case, she isn't even sure if she miscarried or whether she menstruated. The rule is a bit more complicated here because she must also observe the laws of menstrual purity. This means that there will be no days of pure blood, as there would be if she had given birth to either a male or female. The first 14 days after the event, she will be impure as if she had given birth to a female. If she sees blood immediately after that, it is considered menstrual blood, because this is more than 11 days after her previous blood. 
If she sees blood on the 34th day, the rule is a bit complicated, for in this case we must be concerned that she had given birth to a male. If she sees blood on the 34th day and then again on the 41st day, if we considered her as a niddah at the outset, then at the time of the blood on the 41st she would not be in niddah, because it is within 11 days of the previous blood (on the 34th day), and she would observe only one day of impurity for every day she sees blood (up to three days). If she had given birth to a girl, then she would pure throughout the whole period (she would be pure from days 15-80).  However, if she gave birth to a male, then the blood on the 34th day would be pure because it was within the 33 days of purity after the week of impurity. The blood on the 41st day would be menstrual blood because it was more than 11 days after he previous menstrual blood. Therefore, in this case she must be concerned that the blood is menstrual and she would have to observe the rules of menstrual impurity.
