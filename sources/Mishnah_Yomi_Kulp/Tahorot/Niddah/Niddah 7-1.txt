Niddah, Chapter Seven, Mishnah One

Introduction
Our mishnah teaches which substances defile when both dry and wet and which defile only while still wet or moist. 

Mishnah One
The blood of a menstruant and the flesh of a corpse convey uncleanness when wet and when dry. 
But the discharge [of a zav], and the phlegm [of a zav] and the spittle [of a zav], a dead sheretz, a nevelah and semen convey uncleanness when wet but not when dry. 
If they can be soaked and then revert to their original condition they convey uncleanness when wet and when dry. 
And how long must they be soaked?   In lukewarm water for a period of twenty four hours.   
Rabbi Yose says: If the flesh of a corpse is dry, and it cannot be soaked and brought back to its original condition, it is clean.

Explanation
Section one:  There are two substances which are treated strictly and defile whether moist or dryâ€”the blood of a menstruant and the flesh from a corpse. 
Section two: In contrast, the substances that come from the body of a zav (a man who had an abnormal genital discharge) are impure only while still moist. The same is true for a dead sheretz (creepy crawly thing), a nevelah (an animal not slaughtered in the proper manner) and semen.
Section three: However, if one can soak these substances in lukewarm water for a period of up to 24 hours and they return to being moist as they were previously, then they are still impure. In other words, for something to be considered all dried up and therefore pure, it must be irrevocably dried up.
Section four: Rabbi Yose says that the flesh of a corpse is also pure if it becomes irrevocably dry.
