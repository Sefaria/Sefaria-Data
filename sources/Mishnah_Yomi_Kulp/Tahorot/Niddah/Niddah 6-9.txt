Niddah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Nine

Mishnah Nine
Whatever has scales has fins, 
But there are fish that have fins and no scales. 
Whatever has horns has [split] hooves; 
But there are animals that have [split] hooves and no horns. 

Explanation
Section one: For fish to be kosher they need fins and scales. Some fish have fins but no scales, but if a fish has scales, for sure it has fins (see Hullin 3:7). 
Section two: Animals need split hooves to be kosher. Any animal with horns must have split hooves. However, there are animal that have split hooves, such as a pig, but do not have horns.
