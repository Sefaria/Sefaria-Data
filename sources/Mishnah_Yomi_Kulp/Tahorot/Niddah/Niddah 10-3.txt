Niddah, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
If a zav or a zavah examined themselves on the first day and found themselves clean and on the seventh day and found themselves clean, but did not examine themselves during the other intervening, days:
Rabbi Eliezer says: they are in a presumptive condition of cleanness. 
Rabbi Joshua says: they are entitled [to count as clean] only the first day and the seventh day. 
Rabbi Akiva says: they are entitled to reckon as clean the seventh day alone.   

Explanation
Section one:  A zav or a zavah (people who have experienced unnatural genital discharge, i.e. not semen or menstrual blood) need to be free of discharge for seven days before they become pure. They are supposed to examine themselves every day. However, instead of checking themselves every day, they checked themselves only on the first and last day of their impurity.
Section two: Rabbi Eliezer rules the most leniently. Since they checked at the beginning and at the end of their impurity, they are assumed to be clean during the intermediary days. 
Section three: Rabbi Joshua says that only the first and last days count as days of purity. They need to count five more pure days. This seems to be some sort of penalty because if they had truly been impure during the intermediary days, the first day would not have counted towards the seven.
Section four: Rabbi Akiva says exactly thisâ€”they can only count the last day because they may have been impure for all of the intermediary days. In other words, the fact that they were pure for the first day counts for nothing.
