Niddah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Six

Introduction
The next two mishnayot deal with substances that could be used to remove stains, but not bloodstains, from garments. 

Mishnah Six
Seven substances should be applied to a stain: tasteless spittle, the liquid of crushed beans, urine, lye, soapwort, cimolian earth, and potash. 
If one immersed it and then handled clean things on it, and then applied to it the seven substances and the stain did not fade away it must be a dye, and the clean things remain clean and there is no need to immerse it again. 
If the stain faded away or grew fainter, it must be a bloodstain and the clean things are unclean and it is necessary to perform immersion again.

Explanation
Section one: These seven substances are considered to be some form of ancient detergent. They are strong enough to remove a bloodstain, but not strong enough to remove dye.
Section two: A woman had a garment with a stain on it and then immersed it to make it clean. Then she handled clean objects and only after that she decided she better test the object to see if the stain was blood or dye. If she applied all seven substances to the stain and it remained, then it is clearly dye. The impure things that she touched remain pure and she need not immerse the garment again.
Section three: However, if the stain faded or disappeared due to the application of the seven substances, then it is to be considered blood. The pure things she handled are considered impure and she must immerse the garment again.
