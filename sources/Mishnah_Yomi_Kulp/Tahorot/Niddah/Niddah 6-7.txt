Niddah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
Whatever [beast] is subject to the laws of the first of the fleece is also subject to that of the priestly gifts.
But there may be [a beast] that is subject to the law of the priestly gifts and not to that of the first of the fleece.

Explanation
There are two mitzvot mentioned in this mishnah: the "first of the fleece" and "priestly gifts." A person must give the first of the fleece that he shears to the priest. When he offers a sacrifice that doesn't entirely go to the priest, he gives the priest the shoulder, the cheeks and the stomachâ€”the "priestly gifts." Only female sheep are liable to the first of the fleece, but all beasts offered as a sacrifice are liable for the priestly gifts.
