Tevul Yom, Chapter Three, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
	•	If a beaten egg was on top of vegetables of terumah, and a tevul yom touches the egg, then he disqualifies only that stalk [of the vegetables] that is opposite the part [of the egg] he touched.  
	•	Rabbi Yose says: the entire upper layer.
	•	But if it was arranged like a cap  it does not serve as a connective.  

Explanation
Section one: The mishnah discusses an egg that was fried and put on top of some terumah vegetables. If the tevul yom touches the egg, he doesn't disqualify all of the vegetables—just the stalk that was directly below the part of the egg he touched.
Rabbi Yose says that he disqualifies the entire upper layer of vegetables which touch the egg.
Section two: If the egg was arranged like a hat over the vegetables, and the egg did not touch them, then touching the egg doesn’t count as touching the vegetable. They remain pure.
I think I'm going to go make myself an egg (I'm writing this on Pesah, and there really isn't much else to eat).
