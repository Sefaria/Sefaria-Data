Tevul Yom, Chapter One, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Today's mishnah contains mostly the opposite scenarios of yesterday's mishnah—objects that are considered to be connected, such that if the tevul yom touches one of them, they are all defiled. 

Mishnah Two
	•	If one had collected pieces of hallah without the intention of separating them afterwards, 
	•	or a batter-cake that had been baked on another after a crust had formed in the oven,  
	•	or froth had appeared in the water prior to its bubbling up, 
	•	or the second scum that appeared in the boiling of groats of beans, 
	•	or the scum of old wine, 
	•	or that of oil of all kinds,  
	•	or of lentils,
	•	Rabbi Judah says: also that of beans;
	•	All these are defiled when touched by a tevul yom. 
	•	And there is no need to say, [this is the case if touched] by other sources of uncleanness.  

Explanation
Section one: Since he didn't intend to separate them, they count as connected.
Section two: Since the crust had already formed he won't separate them so that they bake better.
Section three: Prior to boiling the froth is considered connected to the water. 
Section four: The second scum that rises on the surface of boiling groats is connected to the dish.
Section five: The scum on top of old wine is considered connected—only the new scum was considered separate.
Section six: The scum that emerges on the top of boiling oil is always considered connected to the oil. 
Section seven: The same is true with lentils and beans, according to Rabbi Judah. 
Section eight: A tevul yom, and all the more so a truly impure person, who touches any of these things defiles the whole thing because all of the parts are considered to be connected.
