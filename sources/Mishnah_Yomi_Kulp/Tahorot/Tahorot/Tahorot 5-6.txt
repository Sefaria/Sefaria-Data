Toharot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah contains the same ruling as yesterday's mishnah, it just refers to a different case of doubtful impurity. Whereas yesterday's case discussed a situation in which we are not sure which of two men walked down an impure path, today's mishnah discusses a case where we are not sure which of two men ate an impure loaf of bread. Other than that, the mishnah is the same, so look at yesterday's mishnah for an explanation. 

Mishnah Six
If there were two loaves, the one unclean and the other clean, and a man ate one of them and then prepared clean food, and afterwards another man came and ate the second loaf and then prepared clean food:
Rabbi Judah ruled: if each by himself asked for a ruling they are both to be declared clean, but if they asked simultaneously both are to be declared unclean. 
Rabbi Yose ruled: in either case they are both unclean.
