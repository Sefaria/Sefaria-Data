Toharot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah continues to explore the distinction between cases where one wants the olives to sweat and cases where he does not. 

Mishnah Six 
If one put his olives on a roof to dry, even though they are piled up to the height of a cubit, they do not become susceptible to uncleanness.   
If he put them in the house to putrify, even though he intends to take them up on the roof, or if he put them on the roof so that they might open so that they could be salted,  they become susceptible to uncleanness. 
If he put them in the house while he secured his roof or until he could take them elsewhere, they do not become susceptible to uncleanness.   

Explanation
Section one: If he put them on the roof to dry they are not susceptible to impurity because he does not want them to sweat. This is true even if they are piled high enough that the bottom ones definitely will sweat. Again, the issue is not whether they sweat, but whether he wants them to. 
Section two: In these cases, he put them somewhere for them to start to soften or go bad so that he could crush them and make oil. Or he put them on the roof so that they would split open so he could salt them. In all of these cases, he wants them to sweat. Therefore, the liquid that they emit makes them susceptible to impurity.
Section three: In this case he put them in his house temporarily, just until he could bring them somewhere else to soften them. Even though he does want the olives to be softened, they are not susceptible because he doesn't really want them to start this process in the house, where he is currently storing them.
