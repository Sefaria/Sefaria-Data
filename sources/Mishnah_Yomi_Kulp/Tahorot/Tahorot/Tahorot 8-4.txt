Toharot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
One who left his house open and found it open, or locked and found it locked, or open and found it locked, it remains clean.
But if he left it closed and found it open:
Rabbi Meir says that it is unclean;
But the sages say that it remains clean, since, though thieves had been there, they may have changed their mind and gone away. 

Explanation
Section one: One doesn't assume that someone had broken into one's house and defiled the things in there without some sign of breaking and entering. So if he left the house open or locked and returned and found it in the same state, the house and its contents remain pure. Even if he left it open and found it locked, we don't assume that someone came in and locked the door when he went out. 
Section two:  If he left it closed and found it open and then looked around and even it didn't look like anyone had been there, Rabbi Meir says that he must assume that impure thieves touched the objects in the house. Therefore, all of the contents must be regarded as defiled. Obviously, if he could see that people had touched the stuff, he would have to treat it as impure. 
The other sages say that there is a possibility that no one touched the contents of the house, and therefore the contents remain pure. After all, if thieves had really touched the stuff, one might ask why they didn't steal it.
