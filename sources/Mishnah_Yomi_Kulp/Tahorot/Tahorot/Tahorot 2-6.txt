Toharot, Chapter Two, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Today's mishnah builds on the three previous mishnayot but adds in the factor of liquids, which as we have seen on many occasions, amplify impurity.

Mishnah Seven
Second [degree uncleanness] in common food conveys uncleanness to unconsecrated liquids and causes invalidity to terumah food.
Third [degree of uncleanness] in terumah conveys uncleanness to consecrated liquids and causes invalidity to holy food that was prepared in conditions of cleanness appropriate to holy food; 
But if it was only prepared under conditions of cleanness appropriate to terumah, it conveys uncleanness at a first and at a second remove, and causes invalidity to holy food at one additional remove.

Explanation
Section one: We learned before that food with second degree impurity invalidates terumah. This mishnah teaches a rule: anything that invalidates terumah also conveys impurity to non-sacred liquids, even if the food wouldn't defile common food. So common food (hullin) with second degree impurity defiles all liquids, but when it comes to food, it only disqualifies terumah.
Section two: The same is true with terumah food that has third degree uncleanness. It conveys first degree impurity to holy liquids, because terumah with third degree uncleanness does invalidate holy food.
The mishnah now adds a caveat to this previous rule. If the terumah food was prepared in order to have the sanctity of holy food, then if it has third degree impurity it disqualifies holy food but doesn't cause it to be defiled.
But if it was prepared under the conditions of purity appropriate to terumah, it is not considered to have been guarded for the purpose of being used with holy food. Therefore, it is treated as if it has first degree impurity. It will defile the first thing it touches, and that will defile something else, giving it third degree impurity. The third thing will invalidate holy food.
