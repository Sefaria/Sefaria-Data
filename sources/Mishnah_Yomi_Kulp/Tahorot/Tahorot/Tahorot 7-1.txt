Toharot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah One

Mishnah One
A potter who left his pots and went down to drink:  the innermost pots remain clean but the outer ones are unclean.  
Rabbi Yose says: When is this so? When they are not tied together, but when they are tied together, all the pots  are clean.  
One who gave over his key to an "am haaretz" the house remains clean, since he only gave him the guarding of the key. 

Explanation
Section one: A potter who wished to preserve the purity of his pots, left them for a few moments in the public domain unguarded. When he returns he must regard the outer ones as defiled lest an am haaretz, a Jew who does not preserve his purity, touched them with his cloaks which are considered impure. Note that the am haaretz might have done so accidentally for when the potter left his pots in the public domain, the path became a bit narrower. However, the inner pots are pure.
Section two: Albeck explains that Rabbi Yose thinks that the concern is that the am haaretz picked up one of the pots to inspect it. If the pots are tied together, then he could not have done so and they remain pure.
Section three: A person who preserves the purity of the objects in his house who has given over his key for guarding to a person who does not observe the laws of purity need not worry that the am haaretz went into his house and defiled the things there. Just as is the case today, when one gives his key to his neighbor the understanding is that he is only giving him the key. He does not expect him to enter the house.
