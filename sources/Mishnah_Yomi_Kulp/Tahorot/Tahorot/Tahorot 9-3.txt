Toharot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
When their preparation is finished behold they are susceptible to uncleanness. 
If an unclean liquid fell upon them they become unclean.   
The sap that issues from them:
Rabbi Eliezer says it is clean,   
But the sages say that it is unclean. 
Rabbi Shimon says: they did not dispute the ruling that sap that issues from olives is clean.
But about what did they dispute? About that which comes from the vat:
That Rabbi Eliezer says is clean 
And the sages say is unclean.

Explanation
Section one: Once the preparation of the olives has been completed, they are susceptible to impurity for they have had contact with the sap that flows out of them. What this means is that if unclean liquid falls on them, it renders all of the olives impure, not just the place it touched. This is because the independent olives have now become one lump of olives, all connected to one another.
Section two: Rabbi Eliezer disagrees with the opinion in section one. The sap that issues from the olives does not render them susceptible to impurity. It is not yet considered oil.  
The sages agree with section one. This sap renders them susceptible and once they are impure it will also defile other olives.
Section three: Rabbi Shimon gives another version of the debate found in sections one and two. According to Rabbi Shimon, all of the sages agree that the sap that comes forth from the olives does not render them susceptible. They disagree about the liquid that comes out of the vat. The olives are placed in this vat after they have been crushed and before they are to be squeezed. This sap contains some oil and therefore the sages say it makes them susceptible to impurity. But the sap that flows before they have been placed in the vat is not "oil" and does not make them susceptible.
