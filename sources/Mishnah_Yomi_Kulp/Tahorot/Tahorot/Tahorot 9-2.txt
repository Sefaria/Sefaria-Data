Toharot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our mishnah is a continuation of Rabban Gamaliel and the sages' opinion from yesterday's mishnah, that the olives are not susceptible to impurity until he has decided to take them to the olive press.

Mishnah Two
If he finished the gathering but intended to buy some more, or if he had finished buying but intended to borrow some more, or if  a time of mourning, a wedding feast or some other hindrance befell him then even if zavim and zavot trampled over them   they remain clean.   
If any unclean liquids fell upon them, only the place where it touched them becomes unclean. 
Any liquid that comes out of them is clean.

Explanation
Section one: In all of these cases, the owner of the olives does not want more liquid to flow from the olives because he either intends to add more olives later, or he is going to be delayed from pressing due to some unforeseen circumstance (a relative died, he was invited to a wedding or something of that nature). In these cases the olives are not susceptible to impurity. So if a zav or a zavah (people with abnormal genital discharge) trample over the olives, they do not become impure.
Section two: Unclean liquids that fall on produce cause it to become susceptible to impurity and impure simultaneously. If some unclean liquid falls on these olives, only the part upon which the liquid fell is impure. The remaining olives are still clean.
Section three: Any liquid that comes out of the olives whose processing has not been completed is clean. This rule is obvious and is already stated in section one. It is only here to be contrasted with the cases we will learn tomorrow in mishnah three. So stay tuned!
