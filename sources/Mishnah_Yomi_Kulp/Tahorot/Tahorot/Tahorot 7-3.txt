Toharot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
One who left craftsmen in his house, the house is unclean, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
But the sages say: the only part that is unclean is where they can stretch out their hand and touch it.

Explanation
Section one: The craftsmen that he left in his home are amei haaretz (plural of am haaretz). Just as he held in yesterday's mishnah, so too here Rabbi Meir holds that all of the items in the house are considered defiled. The owner of the house does not sit there and guard them to make sure they don't touch anything.
Section two: This is the same as their opinion in yesterday's mishnah. Only the things that they can reach out and touch from the place where they are doing their work are impure.
