Toharot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
One who had finished [the gathering of his olives] and put aside one basketful, let   him put it [in the container] in front of a  priest, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
Rabbi Judah says: he must hand him over the key immediately.   
Rabbi Shimon says:   within twenty-four hours.

Explanation
Section one: The mishnah refers to an am haaretz who has crushed all of his olives in the crushing container but left over one container so that the olives would not become susceptible to impurity. From these olives he intended to separate terumah. Note that an am haaretz does seem to separate terumah and to respect the purity of the terumah so that a priest could make use of it. However, he doesn't separate tithes, nor does he preserve the purity of his common food.
The question that the sages ask is what must he do to make sure that the olives remain pure?
Rabbi Meir says that he should put the olives in the container in which they are crushed in front of the priest. This way the priest can make sure they stay pure.
Section two: Rabbi Judah says that the am haaretz must immediately give over to the priest the key to the container. Evidently, he affords little trust to the am haaretz.
Rabbi Shimon gives him a little leewayâ€”he has twenty-four hours in which to give over the key.
