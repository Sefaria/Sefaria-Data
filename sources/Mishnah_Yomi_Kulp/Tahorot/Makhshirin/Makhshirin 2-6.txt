Makhshirin, Chapter Two, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Our mishnah is a continuation of yesterday's mishnah, dealing with a city in which Jews and Gentiles live mixed. 

Mishnah Six
If one found in that city vegetables sold [on Shabbat]: 
If the majority [of the inhabitants] were non-Jews, one may buy them immediately   [after the conclusion of Shabbat]; 
If the majority were Israelites, one must wait until [vegetables] can arrive from the nearest place;   
If they were half and half, one must [also] wait until [vegetables] can arrive from the nearest place; 
If there was there a [non-Jewish] authority, one may buy them immediately [after the conclusion of Shabbat].

Explanation
Section one: The person finds vegetables in such a city and doesn't know whether they were picked that day and transported by a Jew or by a non-Jew. If they were picked by a Jew then they are prohibited because it is prohibited for a Jew to pick vegetables on Shabbat. 
Section two: This is the same as the clauses found in yesterday's mishnah.
Section three: As in yesterday's mishnah, we learn here that if there are some non-Jewish authorities in town we can assume that the special resources (vegetables, warm bath water) were designated for them. In this case, the Jew can buy the vegetables immediately after Shabbat.
