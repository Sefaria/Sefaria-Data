Negaim, Chapter Thirteen, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
If a house overshadowed a house with a nega and so also if a tree overshadowed a house with a nega, anyone who enters the outer [of the two] remains clean, the words of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah. 
Rabbi Eliezer said:  if one stone of it causes uncleanness by entering, should not the house itself cause uncleanness by entering?  

Explanation
Section one: This mishnah discusses a house that overshadows another house with a nega or a tree that overshadows a house with a nega. According to Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah one who enters the outer house or goes under the tree, meaning the structure that overshadows, is not impure. 
Section two: Rabbi Eliezer disagrees, drawing a sort of "a fortiori" argument. If the impurity of an afflicted house is strong enough that if one enters the house he is impure, then all the more so it should cause one who enters an "ohel," an overshadowing structure, to be impure.
