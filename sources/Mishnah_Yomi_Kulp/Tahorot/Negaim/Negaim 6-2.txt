Negaim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
If a bright spot was of the size of a split bean and in it there was quick flesh of the size of a lentil:
If the bright spot grew larger it is unclean, but if it grew smaller it is clean.
If the quick flesh grew larger it is unclean, and if it grew smaller it is clean. 

Explanation
Section one: The bright spot is large enough to be impure and inside it there is quick flesh, which is one of the signs of impurity. The quick flesh is the size of a lentil, which is also the minimum size it needs to be in order to be impure.
Section two: It is obvious that if the bright spot grew larger, it is unclean. It was already unclean due to the quick flesh. This line is here because of the second half. If the bright spot grew smaller, it is pure because it is now less than the size of a split bean.
Section three: If the quick flesh grew larger, the nega is still impure, as long as it is still surrounded by the nega itself. However, if the quick flesh grew to be smaller than a lentil, the nega is pure, because that is the minimum size for the quick flesh.
