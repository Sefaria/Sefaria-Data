Negaim, Chapter Four, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight
A bright spot the size of a split bean, and it spreads to the extent of half a split bean, while of the original spot there disappeared as much as half a split bean: 
Rabbi Akiba says: it must be inspected as a new one,   
But the sages say: it is clean. 

Explanation
At the outset, the bright spot (the nega) is the requisite size, the size of a split bean. It then spreads, but the original spot contracts an equal amount. It is almost as if the nega shifted a bit. 
Rabbi Akiva says that this is considered a new nega. This means that he will have to be isolated, as at the outset.
The other sages say that since the nega remained the same size as it was in the beginning, it is treated as if it didn't grow and he is pronounced clean (because it didn't spread), if he is at the end of the second week of isolation. If he is at the end of the first week of isolation, he will be isolated for a second week.
We should note that others explain that since there is less than the size of a split bean left of the original nega, it is pure. The part that remains does not join together with the spreading to make it impure.
