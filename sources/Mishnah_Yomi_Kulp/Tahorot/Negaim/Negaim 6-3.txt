Negaim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
A bright spot the size of a split bean and in it there was quick flesh less than the size of a lentil: 
If the bright spot grew larger it is unclean, but if it grew smaller it is clean. 
If the quick flesh grew larger it is unclean, but if it grew smaller,  
Rabbi Meir rules that it is unclean;   
But the sages rule that it is clean, since a nega cannot spread within itself. 

Explanation
Section one: In this case, the nega is large enough to be impure, but the quick flesh is too small. 
Section two: This section is obvious. It is only here to be contrasted with the other sections. 
Section three:  If the quick flesh grows larger it is obviously unclean. However, if it grows smaller that would mean that the nega (the bright spot) itself had spread into the place where the quick flesh used to be. Rabbi Meir says that since the nega spread, it is impure because spreading is a sign of impurity. But the other sages say that the nega must spread out beyond its previous borders in order to be impure. Spreading into itself does not count as "spreading."
