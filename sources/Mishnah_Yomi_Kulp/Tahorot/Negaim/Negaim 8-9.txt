Negaim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Nine

Mishnah Nine
If one came with his whole body white, and on it there was quick flesh to the extent of a lentil, and then the nega spread out covering all his skin, and then the ends of his limbs reappeared:
Rabbi Ishmael says: this is the same as when the ends of the limbs reappear in that of a large bright spot.   
Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah ruled: as when the ends of the limbs  reappeared in a small bright spot. 

Explanation
Section one: I will chart out the stages in this scenario one by one:
Stage one: His whole body was covered with a nega except for a spot with quick flesh. This means he is impure.
Stage two: The nega then spreads over the quick flesh. He is now pure.
Stage three: The ends of his limbs reappear. 
Section two: Rabbi Ishmael says that this is similar to a case we learned about in mishnah seven. A person comes in front of a priest with a nega already covering his whole body and then signs of impurity appear (he is impure) and then they disappear (he is pure). If the ends of his limbs reappear, he remains pure as he was before. So too here when the nega spread to his whole body we consider it as if he is beginning with a large bright spot, one that covers his whole body. The reappearance of natural color in his limbs is not a sign of impurity.
Section three: Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah says that since at the outset there was some quick flesh in his nega (the one that covered the rest of his body) this person is not considered to be like someone who was totally covered at the outset. Rather this person is like someone who had a nega that made him impure, and then it spread to his whole body, thereby making him pure. When his limbs reappear he returns to being impure.
