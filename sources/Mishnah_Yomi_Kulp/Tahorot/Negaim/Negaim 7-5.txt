Negaim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Today's mishnah deals with a nega (the bright spot) that is cut off intentionally or unintentionally. 

Mishnah Five
If one had a bright spot and it was cut off, he becomes clean; 
If he cut it off intentionally: 
Rabbi Eliezer says: [he is clean] only after another nega arises in him and he has attained cleanness after it.
But the sages say: only after it has spread over all his body. 
If it was on the tip of one's foreskin, he should be circumcised.   

Explanation
Section one: If the bright spot was cut off unintentionally we treat it as if it just disappeared and he is pure.
Section two: If he cut it off intentionally after he was already impure, he is in the same situation as described in yesterday's mishnah. Rabbi Eliezer says he must wait until another nega appears and he is purified from that nega. The sages say that he must wait until the nega spreads over his whole body. Until then he is impure. Note that this mishnah can't say "until the nega becomes smaller than a bean" because it has already disappeared.
Section three: Circumcision is a positive commandment. It overrides the prohibition not to cut off a nega. Therefore if a nega appears on the tip of the foreskin that is about to be circumcised, the circumcision is still performed.
