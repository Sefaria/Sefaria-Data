Negaim, Chapter Two, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
A priest who is blind in one eye or the light of whose eyes is dim should not inspect negaim; for it says, "Wherever the priest's eyes can see" (Leviticus 13:12).   
In a dark house one may not open up windows in order to inspect his nega.   

Explanation
Section one:  The priest must have two fully functioning eyes in order to examine negaim. 
Section two:  A "dark house" is a house that doesn't have any windows. One should not open up new windows in such a house in order to examine a nega. However, Albeck notes that if a house already has windows, they may be opened to examine the nega.
