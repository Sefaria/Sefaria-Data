Negaim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight
If it broke out covering all of his skin all at once: 
If this originated in a condition of cleanness, he is unclean;
But if it originated in a condition of uncleanness, he is clean.   
One who becomes clean after having been isolated is exempt from the uncovering his head and rending his clothes, from shaving his hair and from bringing the birds.   
If he becomes clean after he had been certified unclean, he is liable to all these. 
Both convey uncleanness by entering.

Explanation
Section one: As we have learned, sometimes if a nega breaks out and covers someone's whole body he is impure. For instance, if he comes in front of a priest already covered in a nega, he is isolated. And then, the natural color returns to the ends of his limbs and then the nega spreads back to cover his entire body, he becomes impure.
However, if someone comes in front of the priest when he is totally covered and a sign of impurity comes up (white hair or quick flesh) he is impure. When the ends of the limbs reappear he stays impure. If the nega now spreads to his whole body, he becomes pure. 
Section two: The end of this mishnah compares a person who becomes clean after having been isolated with one who becomes clean after having been declared unclean. The former is not liable to uncover his hair or rend his clothes (see Leviticus 13:45), nor is he liable to shave his body or bring bird sacrifices (see Leviticus 14:1-9). Only one who was certified unclean is liable to do so.
However, both a metzora (one who had a nega) who had been isolated and one who had been declared unclean convey uncleanness by entering a house. This is a topic to which we will return in chapter 13 (so stay tuned!).
