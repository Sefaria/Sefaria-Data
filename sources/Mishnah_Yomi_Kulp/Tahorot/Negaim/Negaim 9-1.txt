Negaim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah One

Introduction
Chapter nine deals with a nega that forms in a boil or a burn. This is dealt with in Leviticus 13:18-28.

Mishnah One
A boil or a burn may become unclean in a week and by two signs: by white hair or by a spreading.  
What is a "boil"? An injury received from wood, stone, peat, or the waters of Tiberias, of from any other object whose heat is not due to fire is a  boil. 
What exactly is a "burn"? A burn caused by a live coal, hot embers, or any object whose heat is due to fire is a burning. 

Explanation
Section one: As we learned in 3:4, when it comes to a nega in a boil or burn, only white hair and spreading are signs of impurity. Quick flesh is not. And there is only one week of isolation, not two as there are with other negaim. 
Section two: What I have translated as "boil" is really an inflammation due to contact with something hot other than fire. "Peat" is the refuse from the pressing of olives and it can be very hot when removed from the press. The waters of Tiberias are hot springs.
Section three: A burn is from contact with something that had contact with fire.
