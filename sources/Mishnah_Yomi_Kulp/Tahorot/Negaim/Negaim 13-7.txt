Negaim, Chapter Thirteen, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
In yesterday's mishnah we discussed the topic of "overhanging (ohel)" in connection with a house that has a nega. Today's mishnah deals with impurity conveyed by overhanging in connection with a person that has a nega. 
 
Mishnah Seven
If an unclean person stood under a tree and a clean person passed by, the latter becomes unclean. 
If a clean person stood under a tree and an unclean one passed by, the former remains clean.
If the latter stood still, the former becomes unclean. 
Similarly in the case of a leprous stone he remains clean.
But if it was set down he becomes unclean.

Explanation
Section one: The unclean person has a nega and has either been isolated or declared unclean. He stands under a tree and a clean person passes under the tree without stopping. Despite the fact that he didn't stop, the clean person is defiled.
Section two: However, if a clean person stands and the unclean person passes under the tree without stopping, the clean person remains clean. This is a special rule with regard to those who have a nega—he only conveys impurity if he stops or sits under the ohel (the tree). See next section. 
Section three: As stated above, if the unclean person stands under the tree and the clean person is standing there at the same time, the uncleanness is conveyed to the clean person by the overshadowing tree. This halakhah is derived from Leviticus 13:46 which states, "Outside of the camp shall be his sitting place"—according to rabbinici interpretation he must "sit" or at least stop moving, for him to convey uncleanness through overshadowing.
Section four: The same rules as above apply to a stone that has been removed from a building because it has a nega in it. If the stone is carried by a person who is moving, it does not convey uncleanness. But once it has been set down, it does convey uncleanness.
