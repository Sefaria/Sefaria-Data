Negaim, Chapter One, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Leviticus 19:12-13 states:
18 When an inflammation appears on the skin of one's body and it heals, 19 and a white swelling or a white discoloration streaked with red develops where the inflammation was, he shall present himself to the priest.
Our mishnah deals with the color of this red, called the patukh, which is translated as "variegation." Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Akiva disagree as to the color of this variegation.  

Mishnah Two 
The variegation of the snow-like whiteness is like wine mixed with snow.   
The variegation of the lime-like whiteness is like blood mixed with milk, the words of Rabbi Ishmael. 
Rabbi Akiva says: the reddishness in either of them is like wine mixed with water, only that in the snow-like whiteness the color is bright while in that of lime-like whiteness it is duller. 

Explanation   
Section one: The "snow-like whiteness" refers to the archetype of the baheret mentioned in yesterday's mishnah. If the red is found in such a nega, it must be the color of wine mixed with snow. But if it is found in the duller white spot, the one that is the color of the lime plaster in the Temple, it must be like the color of blood mixed with milk, which I would assume is brighter.
Section two: Rabbi Akiva says that in both cases, that of the snow-white baheret, and the lime-white baheret, the variegation must be noticeable, like the color of wine mixed with water. The only difference is that in the case of the snow-white baheret the color must be bright, whereas in the lime-white baheret it can be duller.
