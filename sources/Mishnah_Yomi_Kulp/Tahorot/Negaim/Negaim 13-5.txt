Negaim, Chapter Thirteen, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
If one who builds in cleanliness with stones from a house that was isolated and the nega returned to the [former] house, the stones must be taken out. 
If it returned to the stones, the first house must be torn down, and the stones serve the second house while the signs are under observation.  

Explanation
Section one: The stones were taken out of a house that was isolated and then used to build a clean house elsewhere. If the nega returns to the former house, the stones in the new house are still considered part of the afflicted house and therefore they must be removed from the new house and discarded.   
Section two: If the nega reappears in the stones themselves, then the first house must still be torn down, as if the nega returned to the house itself. The second house now begins the process of a house afflicted by a nega. The stones remain in the house and they serve as the basis to see if the nega spreads at the end of the second week.
