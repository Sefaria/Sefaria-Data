Negaim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Ten

Mishnah Ten
There is one who shows his nega [to the priest] and thereby gains advantage, while there is one who shows and loses. 
How so? If one was certified unclean and the signs of his uncleanness disappeared, and before he could show it to the priest the nega broke out covering all his skin, he is clean; whereas if he had shown it to the priest he would have been unclean.   
If he had a bright spot in which there was nothing else, and before he could show it to the priest it broke out covering all his skin, he is unclean; whereas if he had shown it to the priest he would have been clean.     

Explanation
Section one:  The mishnah notes the paradox that sometimes a person can benefit by showing his nega to a priest and sometimes he loses out.
Section two: He benefits in the following situation. He was already certified unclean and then the signs of his uncleanness (white hair, quick flesh or spreading) disappeared. Had he gone to see the priest now the priest would have declared him pure. The nega then spreads to his whole body. Since he did not go to the priest to be purified, this is a case of a nega covering a person who is already unclean. He is now clean. Had he gone to the priest, then this would be a case of a nega covering a clean person, in which case he would be impure.
Section three: He has a bright spot with no sign of impurity. Had he gone to the priest he would have isolated him. But before he can go to the priest it spreads over his whole body. He now requires isolation, as we learned in mishnah seven. Had he gone to see the priest when the bright spot first appeared, he would have been isolated and then when the nega spread he would have been declared pure, because a nega that spreads over a person who has been isolated causes him to be declared pure.
