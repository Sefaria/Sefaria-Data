Negaim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
According to the rabbis, for a nega to be impure, it must be on a place on the body that it can be seen entirely at once. Therefore, if the nega is found on the tip of a limb with two sides (such as a finger) such that if one were to look at half the nega, the other half wouldn't be seen, the nega is not impure. Our mishnah lists which "tips of limbs" do not become unclean even if there is a nega on them. 

Mishnah Seven
There are twenty-four tips of limbs in the human body that do not become unclean on account of quick flesh: the tips of the fingers and the toes, the tips of the ears, the tip of the nose, the tip of the penis; and also the nipples of a woman. 
Rabbi Judah says: also those of a man. 
Rabbi Eliezer says: also warts and warts with thin necks do not become unclean on account of quick flesh. 

Explanation
Section one: The twenty-four tips of limbs include the tips of all the fingers and toes, the tips of the ears, nose and penis. That equals twenty four. Added to that on a woman are the tips of her nipples.
Section two: Rabbi Judah adds the nipples of men. [I knowâ€”this might be a bit funny, and I could make some comments, but I will refrain].
Section three: Rabbi Eliezer adds in various types of warts. Albeck explains that "warts with thin necks" are warts that appear on a limb that has been partially severed from a person. Does not sound pleasant.
