Negaim, Chapter Thirteen, Mishnah Eight

Mishnah Eight
If a person who was clean put his head and the greater part of his body inside an unclean house, he becomes unclean.
And if an unclean man put his head and the greater part of his body inside a clean house he causes it to be unclean. 
If he put three fingerbreadths square of a clean cloak into an unclean house, the cloak becomes unclean; 
And if he put even the size of an olive of an unclean [cloak] into a clean house, the house becomes unclean.

Explanation
Section one: For the clean person to become unclean by entering a house afflicted with a nega he must enter his head and the greater part of his body.
Section two: Similarly, for an unclean person to defile the contents of a house through overshadowing, he must enter his head and the greater part of his body.
Section three: A piece of cloth smaller than three by three fingerbreadths is not susceptible to impurity. Therefore, if he puts at least this much of a cloak into an impure house, it becomes impure. 
Section four: However, to convey impurity the piece of cloth need not be three by three fingerbreadthsâ€”a piece the size of an olive is sufficient. Therefore, all he has to do is put a piece of the impure cloak the size of an olive into the house and it will defile the contents through overhanging.
