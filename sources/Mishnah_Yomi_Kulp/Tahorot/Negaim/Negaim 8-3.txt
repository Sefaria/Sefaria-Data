Negaim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
A bright spot in which there was white hair and then it broke out covering his entire skin, even though the white hair remained in its place, he is clean. 
A bright spot in which there was a spreading and then it broke out covering his entire skin, he is clean.  
But in all of these cases if [even] the ends of the his limbs reappeared [in their natural color], he is unclean. 
If it broke out covering a part of his skin he is unclean; 
If it broke out covering all his skin he is clean.

Explanation
Section one: Even though the white hair remains, the fact that the bright spot spread to cover his entire body means that he is pure. In this case even Rabbi Joshua, who holds that if a white hair appeared in a body-covering nega he is impure, agrees that since the white hair was there before the nega covered his entire body, he is pure. The rule that we learned in mishnah one applies hereâ€”if a person is declared impure and then a nega breaks out and covers his entire body, he is pure. 
Section two: Again, if a nega breaks out and covers the entire body after one has been declared impure (here because the nega had already spread), he is pure. 
Section three: If even the ends of his limbs return to their natural color, he becomes impure again. This halakhah is the same as that found in mishnah one.
The last two lines of this mishnah are a type of explanation for section three. Since he is unclean if the nega spreads to only part of his body, he is unclean if the ends of his limbs reappear in their natural color. He is clean only if the nega covers his entire body.
