Negaim, Chapter Twelve, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
The last mishnah of chapter twelve concludes the discussion of the procedure of declaring a house unclean due to a nega. 

Mishnah Seven
He comes again at the end of the week and inspects the nega. 
If it has returned, "He shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them out of the city into an unclean place" (Leviticus 14:45).    
A spreading that adjoins [the original nega] is effective however small it may be; 
One that is distant must be no less than the size of a split bean.
And a nega that returns in houses must be no less than the size of two split  beans.  

Explanation
Section one: After the end of the second week, the priest returns to the house to see if the nega has returned. Remember, the affected stones were removed at the end of the first week.
Section two: If the nega has returned, then the whole house is condemned. 
Section three: If at the end of the first week of isolation the nega has spread, the priest removes only the affected stones, as we learned in yesterday's mishnah. Here we learn that if it spread adjacent to the original nega, the spreading does not have to be of any minimum size. Any spreading is sufficient to mandate the removal of the stones. However, if the nega appears elsewhere in the house, the spreading must be the size of a split bean. 
Section four: If after the originally affected stones are removed the nega returns (in the second week), the renewed nega must be the size of two split beans for there to be a requirement to tear down the entire house.
