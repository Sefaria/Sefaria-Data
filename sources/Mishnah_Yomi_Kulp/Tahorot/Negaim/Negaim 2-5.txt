Negaim, Chapter Two, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Today's mishnah teaches that a person is not allowed to rule on a situation that effects his own status or possessions.

Mishnah Five 
All negaim may be examined by a person, except his own. 
Rabbi Meir ruled: not even the negaim of his relatives.   
All vows may be released by a person, except his own. 
Rabbi Judah says: not even those vows of his wife that affect relationships between her and others.   
All firstlings may be examined by a person, except his own firstlings. 

Explanation
Section one: According to the first opinion, a priest can examine all negaim except his own. 
Rabbi Meir adds that he may also not inspect his relatives' negaim. Since being determined to have a nega would entail becoming impure for a potentially long period of time, allowing one to rule on his own negaim or those of his family would create a serious conflict of interest.
Section two: A sage has the ability to release others from their vows. However, he cannot release his own vows.
Rabbi Judah says that he can't release his wife's vows either, unless they are concerning matters that would affect their relationship. This is a topic that is discussed at length in Tractate Nedarim.
Section three: First-born animals are examined to see if they have a blemish. If they do, they may be slaughtered and eaten as if they were non-sacred animals. One may not examine his own first-born animals because this is an obvious conflict of interest.
