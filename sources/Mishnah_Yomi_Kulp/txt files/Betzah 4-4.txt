Betzah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah deals with several laws concerning the use and production of lamps on Yom Tov.

Mishnah Four
1) One may not make a hole in a [lump of clay for use as a] lamp because that is making a vessel.
2) One may not make charcoal on Yom Tov.
3) And one may not cut a wick into two.
a) Rabbi Judah says:  he may cut it into two lamps using a fire.

Explanation
Section one:  Lamps in mishnaic times were basically lumps of clay with a receptacle for oil and a small hole in which one could put a wick.  While lighting a lamp is allowed on Yom Tov, making a lamp is not.  One may not make a hole in a lump of clay in order to make it into a lamp because making a vessel is forbidden on Yom Tov.
Section two:  Charcoal is also considered to be a vessel, or at least as important as a vessel.  Therefore it is forbidden to make charcoal on Yom Tov.
Section three:  Cutting a piece of twine or other material into two in order to make two wicks is also considered similar to making a vessel and is therefore prohibited on Yom Tov.  Rabbi Judah says that while one cannot cut the twine into two with a knife or scissors, he can cut it into two by using fire. The Talmud explains that he places two lamps next to each other and one wick in the two lamps, one end in each.  He then lights the wick in the middle and it will split in two.
