Parah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah deals with various bodily issues that could potentially disqualify the red cow. 

Mishnah Two
1) If the horns or the hoofs of the [red] cow are black they are chopped off. 
2) The eye ball, the teeth and the tongue cause do not invalidate the [red] cow. 
3) One that is dwarf-like is valid. 
4) If there was on it an extra digit and it was cut off:
a) Rabbi Judah says that it is invalid. 
b) Rabbi Shimon says: wherever, if removed, no red hair grows in its place is it invalid.

Explanation
Section one: The red cow must have only red hairs. If it has black hairs, they cannot be removed to make it valid. However, if it has black non-hair parts, parts that can be removed without killing or maiming the animal, they may be removed. These include the horns and hoofs. 
Section two: Some parts need not even be removed if they are black. These include the eye ball, the teeth and the tongue. Removing these "live" parts of the cow would severely damage the cow and therefore this is not done.
Section three: In Bekhorot 7:6 we learned that dwarf-like animals are not disqualified from sacrifices. Here we learn that this includes the red hatat cow.
Section four: Bekhorot 7:6 teaches that if a priest had an extra finger and he cut it off, he can't serve on the altar. Rabbi Judah applies this to the red hatat cow as well. In contrast, Rabbi Shimon says that the cow is invalid only if no red hair grows in its place. If red hair takes its place, it is valid.
