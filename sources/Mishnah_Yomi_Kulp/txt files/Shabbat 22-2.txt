Shabbat, Chapter Twenty-Two, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah deals with soaking food in hot water on Shabbat.  

Mishnah Two
1) Whatever was put into hot water before Shabbat, may be soaked in hot water on Shabbat; 
2) But whatever was not put into hot water before Shabbat may [only] be rinsed with hot water on Shabbat, except old salted fish, small salted fish, and Spanish colius, because their rinsing completes their preparation.  

Explanation
Section one:  Things that are already cooked cannot be again “cooked”, since the definition of “cooking” is using heat to turn something raw into something not raw.  Therefore, if something was already cooked before Shabbat, it can be put back in hot water on Shabbat without this being considered “cooking.”  In other words, “there is no cooking something that has already been cooked.”
Section two:  If it was not cooked in hot water before Shabbat, then it may not be soaked in hot water on Shabbat, because that would be cooking.  However, it still may be rinsed in hot water because rinsing is generally not considered to be cooking.  
The mishnah lists a few exceptions to this rule.  These are all small fish which have thin skins and can be cooked by merely rinsing them in hot water.  Since “their rinsing completes their preparation” they may not even be rinsed in hot water.
