Toharot, Chapter Four, Mishnah One

Introduction
In the cases in this mishnah a clean loaf of bread is thrown among an unclean pile of keys, or an unclean key is thrown among a pile of clean loaves of bread. The question is: are the loaves or loaf made impure. 

Mishnah One
1) One who throws an unclean  object from one place to another: [for instance] a loaf  among keys  or a key  among loaves,  [that which was clean remains] clean.  
2) Rabbi Judah  says: if a loaf  was thrown among keys  the former becomes unclean, but if a key was thrown among loaves  the latter remain clean. 

Explanation
Section one: According to the first opinion we can assume that the clean loaf did not touch the unclean keys, and therefore it remains pure.  According to this opinion it doesn't matter which was thrown and which remained stationary. In either case, the loaf remains pure. 
Section two: Rabbi Judah holds that in cases where something pure is thrown and we don't know if it became impure, it is deemed impure. This is because the source of impurity is stationary. But in cases where something impure is thrown and we don't know whether it defiled something else, the other thing remains pure for the impurity was moving.
