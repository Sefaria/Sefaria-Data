   . A cup   the greater part of which is broken off is  insusceptible to uncleanness. If it was broken in three places      extending over its greater part it is also insusceptible to uncleanness.  R. Simeon ruled: if it lets the greater part of the water leak out it is  insusceptible to uncleanness. If a hole appeared in it and it was mended  with tin or pitch it is still insusceptible to uncleanness.     R. Jose ruled:  if with tin it is susceptible to uncleanness,     but if with pitch it is  insusceptible.

   . A small flask whose neck     was removed remains  susceptible to uncleanness,     but a large one whose neck was removed  becomes insusceptible.     One of spikenard oil whose neck     was removed  becomes insusceptible to uncleanness, since it     scratches the hand.  Large flagons     whose necks were removed remain susceptible to  uncleanness, since they are adapted for the use of holding pickled  foodstuffs. A glass mill-funnel is clean.     R. Jose observed: ‘blessed art  thou, o kelim; for, though thou didst enter with uncleanness,     thou  art gone forth in cleanness’.
