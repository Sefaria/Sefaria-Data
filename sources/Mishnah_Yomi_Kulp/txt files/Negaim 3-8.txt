Explanation
Section one: A house has a three week period of impurity and not two like most human negaim and negaim found in clothes (see Leviticus 14:35ff). House impurity will be discussed in chapter twelve.
The signs of a house nega are green or red colored spots, or a spreading after the initial nega has been identified.
Sections two-four: Same as in previous mishnayot.
Section five: This is a summary of all of the laws in most of this chapter. The shortest period is for the nega found in a boil or burn (mishnah four) and the longest period is for negaim found in a house.
