Pesahim, Chapter Five, Mishnah Six

Introduction
The mishnah continues to describe the slaughtering process.

Mishnah Six
1) The Israelite killed [the lamb]; 
2) And the priest caught [the blood].  
3) He would hand it to his colleague and his colleague [would hand it] to his colleague.  And he would receive the full [basin] and give back the empty one.  The priest nearest the altar would sprinkle it once over against the base [or the altar]. 

Explanation
Section one:  If an Israelite wishes to slaughter his own pesah he may do so.  Most other sacrifices are slaughtered only by priests.  However, in Ezra 6:20 and II Chronicles 30:17, 35:6,11, the Levites are those who slaughter the pesah.  
Section two:  Only the priest is allowed to catch the blood in the basin, not the Israelite.
Section three:  To expedite the process the priests would pass the blood down the rows which we encountered in yesterday’s mishnah.  The priest at the end of row would sprinkle the blood over the base of the altar and then pass the empty basins back so that more blood could be received in them.  We should note that the mishnah is precise in the order of activities. The priest should first take the full basin and then give back the empty one.  This is because the full basin is one with which a commandment will be performed and one should not pass over the opportunity, even for a moment, to perform a commandment.
