Introduction to Sukkah

Tractate Sukkah can be divided into several sections.  The first two chapters deal with the laws of the sukkah, how one builds a sukkah and how one observes the commandment of dwelling in a sukkah.

The third chapter deals with the laws of the lulav, the four species that one picks up every day during the holiday.  

The fourth and fifth chapters deal with several ceremonies or rituals connected to Sukkot that were observed in the time of the Temple.  They are the beating of the willows, the water libation, and the celebration known as “simhat bet hashoevah.”  We will discuss these in greater detail when we come across them.

Sukkah is perhaps the tractate in Seder Moed whose halakhot most directly correspond to halakhah as it is observed today.  Jews still build sukkot and still take up a lulav, willow (aravah), myrtle (hadas) and etrog every year on Sukkot.  While there are, as always, many differences between the precise manner in which we observe halakhah today and the way it was observed during the time of the Mishnah, they are, in my opinion, lesser in this area of halakhah than in others.  This makes Sukkah a somewhat easier tractate to learn—we can more often picture what they are doing.

We should note that in the Second Temple period and in the time of the rabbis Sukkot was a holiday of great importance.  Many Jews probably made a pilgrimage to the Temple at this time, there were many exciting rituals taking place at that time and the holiday is full of commandments to be observed. Furthermore, the theological importance of Sukkot is as a holiday in which people would pray for rain in the coming year.  Sukkot is called “The Festival” in rabbinic literature, and this may be another expression of its centrality.
