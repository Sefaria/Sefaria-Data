Bekhorot, Chapter Two, Mishnah One

Introduction
Chapter two begins to discuss the first-born of a pure animal, such as a cow. This first-born is holy and must be sacrificed and the meat is eaten by the priests. If it is blemished, it must still be given to the priest, but it need not be sacrificed. 

Mishnah One
1) [An Israelite] who buys a fetus of a cow belonging to a non-Jew or who sells one to him, although this is not permitted, or who forms a partnership with him, or who receives [an animal] from him to look after or who gives [his cow] to him to look after, is exempt from the [law of the] bekhor, for it says: [“I sanctified to Me all the firstborn] in Israel,” (Numbers 3:13) but not in non-Jews.
2) Priests and Levites are subject [to the law of the first-born pure animal]. They are not exempt from [the law of] the first-born of a clean animal, but only of a first-born son and the first-born of a donkey.

Explanation
Section one: This is the same exact halakhah as was taught in the 1:1. See there for commentary.
Section two: Priests and Levites are exempt from two of the three types of bekhorot—the first born of a donkey and their own first-born son. They are, however, liable for the first-born of a pure animal. If a priest or Levite owns a pure animal and it gives birth for the first time and the offspring is male, it must be sacrificed. Then the priest eats the meat, as is always the case.
