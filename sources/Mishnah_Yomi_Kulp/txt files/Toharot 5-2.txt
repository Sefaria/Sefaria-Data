Toharot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Today's mishnah is a direct continuation of yesterday's mishnah, in which a person was not sure if he had been defiled in the public domain. 

Mishnah Two
1) One who said, "I touched an object but I do not know whether it was unclean or clean," or "I touched one but I do not know which of the two I touched": 
a) Rabbi Akiva rules that he is unclean,   
b) But the sages rule that he is clean.   
2) Rabbi Yose says that he is unclean in every case  and clean only in that of the path,   since it is the usual custom for people to walk but it is not their usual practice to touch.

Explanation
Section one: This section refers to the frog and sheretz (dead creepy crawly thing) case from section one in yesterday's mishnah. The person knows that he touched one of the two, but isn't sure which one he touched. Some commentators point out that a turtle, which does count as a sheretz, might be considered to look a little like a frog. This might be especially true when they are dead, which is when the sheretz defiles. 
The positions of the sages and R. Akiva are the same as they were above—Rabbi Akiva says that he is impure and the sages say that he is pure.
Section two: Rabbi Yose distinguishes between the person who walked down the path but doesn't know whether it was the pure or impure path and the other cases. Walking down a path is a normal activity. Therefore, we can assume he might not remember which path he walked down. But randomly touching things (like bones or dead flesh!) is not normal. He could live without touching these things. Therefore, he is considered impure.
