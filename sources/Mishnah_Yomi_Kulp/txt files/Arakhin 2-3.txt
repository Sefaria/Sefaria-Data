Mishnah Three 
1) There are never less than twenty-one blasts in the Temple and never more than forty-eight. 
2) There are never less than two harps, nor more than six. 
3) There are never less than two flutes, nor more than twelve. 
4) On twelve days in the year the flute was played before the altar:  
a) At the slaughtering of the first pesah, 
b) At the killing of the second pesah,  
c) On the first festival day of Pesah, 
d) On the festival day of Atzeret (Shavuot), 
e) And on the eight days of Sukkot. 
5) And they did not play on a pipe [abuv] of bronze but on a pipe of reed, because its tune is sweeter. 
6) Nor was anything but a single pipe used for closing a tune, because it makes a pleasant finale.

Explanation
Section one: There was a minimum of 21 daily trumpet blasts in the Temple and a maximum of 48. The explanation of this section can be found in Sukkah 5:5. The maximum number of blasts was sounded on erev Shabbat during Sukkot.
Section two:  The harps were played to accompany the singing of the Levites.
Section three: The flutes were played on special occasions, namely holidays, as the rest of the mishnah explains. 
Section four: The flute was played on the first day of each holiday, and also on any day that a pesah sacrifice was slaughtered (the fourteenth of Nissan, and the fourteenth of Iyyar). During Sukkot it was played every day.
Section five: The flute that they played was a pipe made of reed, for its sound is sweeter (according to rabbinic tastes) than the bronze pipe. 
Section six: At the conclusion of the song, they would end with a single pipe (flute) which is more pleasant than completing with two (or more) at the same time.
