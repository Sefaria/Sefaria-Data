Avoth, Chapter One, Mishnah Fourteen

Introduction
This mishnah contains one of the most famous statements of Hillel.  Its poetry and its succinct message still make this, in my mind, one of the most memorable of rabbinic sayings.  

Mishnah Fourteen
He [also] used to say: 
If I am not for myself, who is for me? 
But if I am for my own self [only], what am I? 
And if not now, when?  

Explanation
This first statement of Hillel’s is not a statement lauding selfishness, but rather a statement which places a person’s character and qualities squarely on his own two shoulders. A person must work in this world to acquire his own merits, for no one else can do this on his behalf.  
The second statement balances out the first.  Although a person must be concerned for himself, his responsibilities do not end there.  One who does only for himself does not contribute to his people and to the world.  He is not important, for when he passes away, no one else will be effected.  
Finally, if a person puts off his responsibilities, when will he find time to carry them out.  As we say in English, “now is as good a time as ever”.
