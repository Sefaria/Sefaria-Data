Pesahim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Thirteen

Introduction
As we have stated before, people would divide into “companies” in order to eat the pesah, and each company would eat one pesah.  It is forbidden for a person to eat the pesah with two different companies and it is also forbidden for one company to eat in two places.  Our mishnah deals with how two companies can share one house.
I should note that I have explained the mishnah according to the Rambam’s explanation, one which is adopted by Albeck.  Others explain it differently.
 
Mishnah Thirteen
1) Two companies which are eating in one room, these turn their faces in one direction and eat and they turn their faces in another direction and eat, and the boiler is in the middle.   
2) When the servant rises to mix [the wine], he must shut his mouth and turn his face away [from the other company] until he reaches his own company and [there] he eats.   
3) But a bride may turn her face away and eat.

Explanation
Section one:  In order for it not to seem that the two companies are mixed and are sharing two different pesah sacrifices, each company faces in a different direction. The mishnah allows one boiler to be placed in the middle, even though this would contribute to the impression that the two are sharing their pesahim.  The boiler is a pot of hot water with which to mix the wine.
Section two:  Although the servant, a Jew, can serve both groups, he may be registered with only one of them.  So that it is clear that he is not eating from the other group, when he mixes wine for a group other than his own he must close his mouth and not swallow.  He must also turn his mouth towards his own group so that they don’t think that he is eating with the other group.  
Section three:  A bride, who may be embarrassed to eat in front of others, is allowed to turn her face away from her own group.  This will not seem like she is eating with two groups.
