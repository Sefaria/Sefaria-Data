Kelim, Chapter Sixteen, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with various types of baskets and when they become susceptible to impurity. 

Mishnah Three
1) Small reed baskets and baskets [become susceptible to impurity] as soon as their rims are rounded off and their rough ends are smoothed off.
2) Large reed baskets and large hampers, as soon as two rows have been made round their sides.
3) The container of a sifter or a sieve and a cup of the balances, as soon as one circling band has been made round their sides.
4) A willow basket, as soon as two twists have been made around its wide sides.
5) And a rush basket, as soon as one twist has been made round it.

Explanation
Section one: These small baskets are ready for use and therefore susceptible as soon as their ends are tied and the loose pieces cut off, as was the rule with regard to the baskets mentioned in yesterday's mishnah. 
Section two: Larger baskets are susceptible as soon as they have a bottom and they are built up two rows from the bottom. It seems that since they were large in their width, their sides did not need to be too high.   
Section three: These containers don't even need to be built up two rows—one row is sufficient for them to be of minimal use.
Section four: The word "twists" which I have translated here reflects the fact that the Hebrew uses a different word for rows and twists. However, commentators interpret them to mean basically the same thing, the only difference being that willow and rush baskets are made in a slightly different fashion. Nevertheless, if they are built up two rows/twists, they are susceptible.
Section five: The rule regarding rush baskets is the same as that regarding the containers mentioned in section three.
