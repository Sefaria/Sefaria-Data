Yevamoth, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah says basically the same thing as the previous one, but in a reverse order.  

Mishnah Six
The daughter of a priest who was married to an Israelite may not eat terumah.  
If he died and she had a son by him she may not eat terumah. 
If she was [subsequently] married to a Levite she may eat tithe. 
If he died and she had a son by him she may eat tithe. 
If she was [subsequently] married to a priest she may eat terumah. 
If he died and she had a son by him she may eat terumah. 
If her son by the priest died she may not eat terumah. 
If her son by the levite died she may not eat tithe. 
If her son by the Israelite died she returns to the house of her father; 
And it is concerning such a woman that it is said, “And she returns to her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13).

Explanation
This mishnah is the exact reverse of yesterday’s mishnah.  The woman starts in a situation where she can eat terumah, but then loses that right when she marries an Israelite.  If he dies, and she has had a son with him, she still cannot eat terumah.  If she marries a Levite, she may now eat tithe.  If he dies, and she has had a son with him, she can still eat tithe.  If she now marries a priest, she can eat terumah. .  If he dies, and she has had a son with him, she can still eat terumah.  If this son dies, she goes back to eating tithe.  If this son dies, she goes back to not being able to eat either, because of her son from the Israelite.  If this son dies, she goes back to her original situation and she may eat terumah.  As the verse says, she goes back to the situation of her father’s house.
