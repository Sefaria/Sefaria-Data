Tamid, Chapter Five, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
1) When they came between the Sanctuary and the altar, one took the magrefah and threw it between the Sanctuary and the altar. 
2) People could not hear one another speak in Jerusalem from the noise of the magrefah. 
3) It served three purposes:
i) When a priest heard the sound of it he knew that his fellow priests were going in to bow down, and he would run to join them. 
ii) When a Levite heard the noise he knew that his fellow Levites were going in to sing, and he would run to join them. 
iii) And the head of the Ma’amad used to make the unclean stand in the east gate.

Explanation
Section one: The two priests, one who had won the right to offer the incense and the other who had won the right to the firepan, now came between the Sanctuary and the altar. They would take the magrefah, which was a musical instrument shaped like a shovel (see 3:8) and throw it. This loud noise served as a warning to the other priests, as the mishnah explains. 
Section two: The noise of the throwing of the magrefah was so great that all over Jerusalem people could not hear one another speak. I’m assuming this is a bit of an exaggeration.
Section three: The mishnah now lists the three functions that this loud noise would serve. 
First of all, it would warn the priests that it was time to enter the Sanctuary to bow down. We shall learn more of this in tomorrow’s mishnah.
Second, it would warn the Levites that it was time to sing. We shall see more of this in 7:3.
Third, the priests and Levites were split into twenty-four watches or Ma’amad’s, each serving for a week in the Temple (see Taanit 4:2). The priest who stood at the head of each Ma’amad would make the unclean priests and Levites stand at the east gate so that they could go through their purification rituals, which might allow them to serve later during the week in the Temple.
