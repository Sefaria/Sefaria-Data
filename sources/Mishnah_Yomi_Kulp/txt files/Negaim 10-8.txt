Mishnah Eight
1) One who has a scall with yellow hair within it is unclean.   
2) If subsequently black hair grew in it, he is clean; even if the black hair disappeared again he remains clean. 
3) Rabbi Shimon ben Judah says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: any scall that has once been pronounced clean can never again be unclean.   
4) Rabbi Shimon says: any yellow hair that has once been pronounced clean can never again be unclean.

Explanation
Section one: If one has a scall with a yellow hair in it, whether that yellow hair preceded the scall or developed after the scall, he is impure.
Section two: Even if the black hair subsequently disappears, once he is pronounced clean he stays clean.
Section three: Rabbi Shimon ben Judah formulates a general principle that reflects what he believes the previous opinion had stated. Any scall that was unclean, whether because it had spread or because it had a yellow hair, and then became clean because the spreading disappeared or because the yellow hair disappeared, the scall can never become unclean again.
Section four: Rabbi Shimon himself gives a more limited general rule. If the yellow hair was pronounced clean because of the black hair, that yellow hair can itself never serve as a sign of impurity. However, if yellow hair forms and then disappears, and then other yellow hair forms or the scall spreads, then the scall can again become impure.
