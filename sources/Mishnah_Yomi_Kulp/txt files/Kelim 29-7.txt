Kelim, Chapter Twenty-Nine, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Another mishnah discussing the lengths of shafts. If you're getting a bit bored with this (and I'm sure you're not) don't worry, we are almost done with the tractate!
As with yesterday's mishnah, I have commented below on the sections that I believe need some extra clarification.

Mishnah Seven 
1) The remnant of the shaft of an ox-goad at its upper end is regarded as connected up to a length of four [handbreadths].
2) The shaft of a spade, to a length of four [handbreadths].
3) The shaft of a weeding-spade, to five handbreadths.
4) The shaft of a small hammer, to five handbreadths.
5) That of a common hammer, to six handbreadths.
6) The shaft of an axe used for splitting wood or of one used for digging, to  six [handbreadths].
7) The shaft of the stone-trimmers’ axe, up to six handbreadths. 

Explanation
Section one: We discussed the ox-goad briefly in 25:2. This shaft seems to work similarly to the shaft of an ax. The mishnah discusses the "remnant" which is the part that sticks upward out of the ox-goad. It is considered connected up to a length of four handbreadths.
I am trying to put a picture in here that I found on the web, but I'm not sure that you will all receive it. If you don't google "oxgoad" and you should be able to find some pics.
