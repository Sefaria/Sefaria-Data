Berakhot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a case where a person has several different types of foods in front of him and wants to eat them all.  The question is which should he eat first so that its blessing will be recited first.

Mishnah Four
There were several kinds of food before him: 
Rabbi Judah says that if there is among them one of the seven species, he blesses over that. 
But the sages say: he may bless over which ever one he wants.

Explanation
According to Rabbi Judah, he should first bless over any food that comes from one of the seven species with which the land of Israel is blessed (Deuteronomy 8:8):  wheat, barley, grapes (for wine), figs, pomegranates, olive (oil) and dates (used to make date honey).  In other words, certain foods have intrinsic value and therefore their blessing should be recited first.
The other sages, on the other hand, hold that the value of the food is in the eye of the eater, therefore one can bless over which ever food one wishes to eat first.
