
Mishnah Six
1) If a man deposited produce with his fellow, even if it should perish he may not touch it.  
a) Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  “He may sell it before a court of law, since he is like someone who returns a lost object to its owners.”

Explanation
In the scenario in our mishnah Reuven leaves his produce with Shimon to watch until he comes back.  When Reuven doesn’t return for an extended period Shimon is left with a dilemma.  On the one hand, a person guarding someone else’s possessions generally may not use the possessions.  However, if he does nothing with the produce the produce will rot.  According to the first opinion in the mishnah, Shimon should just leave the produce even at the risk of it perishing.  The reason is that Reuven may want his produce back, since that was the produce he worked so hard to grow.  If you have your own backyard garden you know that this is often true.  Even if the fruit objectively is not better than the fruit in the store, to the person who grew it, it will taste better.  
According to Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, better for Shimon to sell the produce and hold the money for the owner.  This sale must be done in front of a court of law in order to prevent the person watching from selling the produce at too low of a price.
