Negaim, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah deals with two scalls that are next to each other, with a line of hair separating the two of them. The mishnah is concerned with determining how to tell if one of the scalls has spread.   

Mishnah Six
1) Two scalls side by side and a line of hair separating between them: 
a) If a gap opened up in one place he is unclean,   
b) But if it opened up in two places he is clean.   
2) How big should the gap be?  The space of two hairs. 
3) If there was a gap in one place, even though it is as big as a split bean, he is unclean. 

Explanation
Section one: If one gap opens up between the two scalls then we can say that one of the scalls spread and he is impure.
However, if two gaps open up between them then we look at both scalls as having joined together. Since there are black hairs now within the scall, they prevent the person from being considered impure. 
Section two: The gap that opens up in the line of hair must be the size of two hairs for the two scalls to be considered as one. 
Section three: This section is superfluous for we have already learned that if there is only one gap he is unclean. The section is here because of it is opposite of the last section in mishnah seven which we will learn tomorrow.
