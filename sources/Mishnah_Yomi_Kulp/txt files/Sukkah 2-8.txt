Sukkah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Most of this mishnah is concerned with the obligation of children to observe the commandment of dwelling in the sukkah.

Mishnah Eight
1) Women, slaves and minors are exempt from the [commandment] of the sukkah.
a) A minor who no longer relies on his mother is obligated in the [commandment] of the sukkah.
2) It happened that the daughter-in-law of Shammai the elder gave birth and he opened up the ceiling and put skhakh on top of the bed[posts] on behalf of the minor.  

Explanation
Section one:  Dwelling in the sukkah is a positive time-bound commandment, similar to hearing the shofar.  As such, women and slaves are exempt.  Children are also exempt, as long as they rely on their mothers and need to be with them most of the time.  According to the Talmud, a child who wakes up in the middle of the night and still cries for his mother is not obligated to dwell in the sukkah.  Such a child sleeps where his mother sleeps—outside of the sukkah.  But if he wakes up and doesn't need his mother, then he is obligated to sleep in the sukkah. 
Section two:  In this fascinating story, Shammai the elder opens up a hole in the roof of his house so that his newborn grandson can sleep in the sukkah.  Shammai obviously disagrees with the halakhah in the previous section.  Shammai the elder is also known to have made his son fast on Yom Kippur, far before he would have understood the meaning of fasting.  It seems that Shammai’s concept of commandment is not that one must perform an act with intent in order to affect one’s inner life (what we call “kavvanah”), rather the act must be performed regardless of whether one understands what one is doing. Children must perform mitzvot despite the fact the fact that they clearly don’t understand what they are doing.
