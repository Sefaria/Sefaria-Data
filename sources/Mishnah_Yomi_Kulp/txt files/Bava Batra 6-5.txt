Bava Batra, Chapter Six, Mishnah Five

Introduction
The mishnah which we will learn today deals with a person who owns a cistern behind another person’s property and hence requires a passage through the other’s property to get to his cistern or garden.  The mishnah provides rules to both the property owner and the cistern owner to ensure that the latter receives access without trespassing on the former.

Mishnah Five
1) If he had a cistern behind his fellow’s house, he may go in and out only at the time when others are accustomed to go in and out. 
a) And he may not bring in his cattle and let them drink from his cistern, rather he must draw water and let them drink outside.
b) He and the owner of the house should each make themselves a lock.  

Explanation 
This mishnah discusses the case where a person owns a cistern that exists behind another person’s property.  In such a case the person is allowed to enter the other’s property in order to reach his cistern, but he must do so at the time when people customarily draw water from their cisterns.  He is further restricted from bringing his cattle or other animals onto the other’s property.  Rather he must draw the water and carry it outside.  Finally, the mishnah demands that each of them make a lock.  The cistern owner should make a lock for the cover of the cistern so that the house owner doesn’t steal any water.  The house owner should make a lock on his door so that the cistern owner doesn’t enter when he is not allowed to.
