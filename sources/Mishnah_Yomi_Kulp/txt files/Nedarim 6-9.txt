Nedarim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
This mishnah teaches that if a person vows to abstain from a type of food, he may still eat another type of food that bears the same name, if that other food also has an accompanying name and is not called by the name itself.  This rule will be clear from the examples.  

Mishnah Nine
He who vows abstinence from wine is permitted apple-wine; from oil, is permitted sesame oil; from honey, is permitted date honey; from vinegar, is permitted winter grape vinegar; from leeks, is permitted porrets; from vegetables, he is permitted field-vegetables, because it is an accompanying name.

Explanation
In all of the cases in this mishnah, a person vows abstinence from a certain food, but may still eat another food that has the same name, but also has an accompanying name.  For instance, when a person vows to abstain from wine, his intention is grape wine and not apple wine.  The same is true for honey, which is normally from bees and therefore date honey, which is not called “honey” is permitted.  
Porrets are a type of leek, but are not called “leeks”.  
Field-vegetables are vegetables that grow on their own in the fields.  They are not called “vegetables”, whereas garden-grown vegetables are called “vegetables”.
