Betzah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Four

Introduction
A first-born animal may not be eaten until it becomes blemished (Deuteronomy 15:21-22).  Experts would determine whether an animal was blemished.  Our mishnah deals with a first-born that fell into a pit on Yom Tov and may have been blemished there.  The debate is over whether they may send down an expert to see if the animal had become blemished and if so, bring it up and slaughter it on Yom Tov. 

Mishnah Four 
A first-born beast that fell into a pit:   
1) Rabbi Judah says: let an expert go down and inspect [it].  If it had a blemish he may bring it up and slaughter it, but if not, he may not slaughter it. 
2) Rabbi Shimon says: any animals whose blemish was not observed on the day before the Yom Tov, it is not prepared (mukhan). 

Explanation
Section one:  Rabbi Judah allows the expert to go down into the pit to examine the animal.  If the animal is blemished they may bring the animal out of the pit and slaughter it on Yom Tov.  But if there is no blemish he may not slaughter it nor may he even bring it up from the pit.
Section two:  Rabbi Shimon holds that even if the animal should be found to have a blemish, they still may not bring it out of the pit and slaughter it on Yom Tov because when Yom Tov began that animal could not be slaughtered.  The animal was not “mukhan”, or ready.  Mukhan is the opposite muktzeh.  The animal is muktzeh because when Yom Tov began it could not be used for food because it was still a first-born on whom no blemish had been found.
