Hallah, Chapter Three, Mishnah One
 
Introduction
Our mishnah deals with the question of when one can eat dough without separating hallah.

Mishnah One
1) One may snack from dough, until it is rolled, in [the case of] wheat [flour], or before it is made into a solid mass, in [the case of] barley [flour].  
2) [Once] one has rolled it [in the case of] wheat [flour], or made it into a solid mass, in [the case of] barley [flour], one who eats it is liable for death [at the hands of heaven].  
3) As soon as she puts in the water she should lift out the hallah, provided that there are not five-fourths [of a kav] of flour left there. 

Explanation
Section one: A person can eat a piece of dough as a snack even though hallah has not yet been removed from it. This is true as long as long as it has not yet been rolled, if the flour was made of wheat, or made into a solid mass, in the case of barley. Wheat flour is finer and therefore, it is considered dough once it has been kneaded well and rolled out to make loaves of bread (flat like pita). Barley flour is coarser and therefore it is considered dough once she gets it to stick together into a lump. 
This rule should be familiar if you have already learned Tractate Maasrot. There we learned that in general one can snack from produce before its processing has been completed.  
Section two: After it has been either rolled or made into a solid mass, a non-priest who eats it is liable for “death at the hands of heaven.” This is the same penalty for a non-priest who eats terumah, and as we have seen, the laws of hallah are frequently derived from the laws of terumah, because the Torah calls both “holy.”
Section three: The way to avoid this severe penalty is for the woman to remove the hallah from the dough as soon as she puts water in the flour. Even though one could snack on it until it is rolled or made into a solid mass, this is not advisable, because it might lead one to snack on it at a later point. 
The version of our mishnah reads “provided that there are not five-fourths [of a kav] of flour left there.” This is interpreted to mean that if even after she removes hallah before it has been kneaded, there remain 5/4 of a kav, then the problem has not been solved, because she took out hallah to early—she should only take it out once it has been kneaded, and not as soon as the water has been mixed in with the flour.
Another version of this section reads, “as long as there are 5/4 of a kav of flour there.” If there is not such a measure, she should not take out hallah, even if she will add more flour later on.
