Eruvin, Chapter Eight, Mishnah One

Introduction 
Today’s mishnah deals with how one can set up a collective Shabbat border limit eruv, meaning an eruv that will allow many people to extend their Shabbat border limit by 2000 cubits to one direction.

Mishnah One
How does one effect participation in connection with Shabbat limits?   
One sets down a jar and says, “Behold this is for all the inhabitants of my town, for anyone who may desire to go to a house of mourning or to a house of feasting”.  
Any one who accepted [the eruv] while it was still day is permitted [to enjoy its benefits] but if one did it after dusk he is forbidden, since they do not set up an eruv after dusk.

Explanation
The language of this mishnah is parallel to that of 7:6 above, which discussed alley partnerships.  Again, a person takes a jar of food and brings it to wherever he wants to establish his “Shabbat resting place”.  It is from this place that his 2000 cubit radius will be counted.  He announces that this eruv will count for anyone who wishes to make use of it.  
However, unlike alley partnership eruvin, Shabbat border eruvin require the person to accept the eruv actively.  This is because by accepting the extension on one side of town, he loses on the other side of town. 
The person must accept the eruv before Shabbat begins, since this is the determinative moment for the establishment of eruvin.  He cannot accept the eruv after Shabbat has already begun.
Note that the mishnah mentions two common reasons why one would set up a border eruv—to pay a shivah call or to visit a house of feasting, a place where a wedding was being celebrated (a wedding which took place before Shabbat).  The reason why the mishnah mentioned these examples is that the mishnah holds that one can set up a border eruv only in order to attend to a mitzvah.
