Peah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Eight

Introduction 
This mishnah teaches a very similar ruling to the mishnah that we learned yesterday, regarding one who dedicates his agricultural produce and then redeems it. Today’s topic is tithes, whereas yesterday we learned about the gifts that go to the poor.

Mishnah Eight
1) Similarly one who dedicates his produce prior to the stage when they are subject to tithes   and then redeemed them, they are liable [to be tithed]. 
2) If [he dedicated them] when they had already become subject to tithes and then redeemed them, they are liable [to be tithed].   
3) If he dedicated them before they had ripened, and they became ripe while in the possession of the [Temple] treasurer, and he then redeemed them, they are exempt, since at the time when they would have been liable, they were exempt.  

Explanation
Section one:  Produce becomes liable to be tithed once it has been harvested, processed and made into a pile.  Before this point he may eat of it without tithing.  In the scenario in this section, he dedicates it before it becomes liable to be tithed and then he redeems it before it comes liable to be tithed.  He is then liable to tithe the produce when it becomes liable for tithes.
Section two:  In this case he dedicated it and redeemed it after he became liable for tithing, so again, he is liable to tithe the produce before he goes ahead and uses it.
Section three:  In this case, he dedicates it before it is even a third ripe and then the produce ripens, is harvested and the Temple treasurer makes the grain into a pile.  Since the grain was in the legal possession of the Temple when it became liable for tithes, he is not liable for tithes when he redeems it.
