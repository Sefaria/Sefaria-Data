Nazir, Chapter Five, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah again deals with the debate between Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel over mistaken nazirite vows.

Mishnah Five
If [people] were walking along the road and [saw] someone coming towards them, and one said, “Behold, I am a nazirite if it is so-and-so,” and the other said, “Behold, I am a nazirite if it is not so-and-so,” [and a third said,] “Behold I am a nazirite if one of you is a nazirite,” [and a fourth said, “Behold I am a nazirite] if neither of you is a nazirite,” [and a fifth said, “Behold I am a nazirite] if both of you are nazirites,” [and a sixth said, “Behold I am a nazirite] if all of you are nazirites”: 
a) Beth Shammai says:  all of them are nazirites. 
b) Beth Hillel says only those whose words were [not] fulfilled are nazirites.   
c) Rabbi Tarfon says: not one of them is a nazirite.

Explanation
Obviously, not all of the people who vowed these nazirite vows can be correct.  For instance, if it is “so and so”, only the first and third people are correct.  If it is not “so and so”, the second and third people are correct.  
Nevertheless, Beth Shammai holds that they are all nazirites, because even nazirite vows taken under a mistaken premise are binding.  
Beth Hillel says that only those whose words were actually fulfilled, that is whose words turn out to be correct, are nazirites.  Note that the mishnah actually says “not fulfilled”.  The Talmud emends the mishnah to read “fulfilled.”  Albeck explains that either version leads to the same conclusion, for Beth Hillel holds that a nazirite vow made under a mistaken premise is not valid.  
Rabbi Tarfon holds that unclear nazirite vows are not binding.  Even if it turns out that what he thought was indeed correct, a person must have full awareness of the facts at the time of his vow for his vow to be valid.
