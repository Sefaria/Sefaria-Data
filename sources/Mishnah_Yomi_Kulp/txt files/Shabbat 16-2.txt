Shabbat, Chapter Sixteen, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah deals with how much food may be saved from a fire on Shabbat.

Mishnah Three 
1) Food for three meals may be saved, that which is fit for a person, for a person, that which is fit for a beast, for a beast.  
2) How is this so? 
a) If a fire breaks out on the eve of Shabbat, food for three meals may be saved. 
b) If in the morning, food for two meals may be saved.
c) If at [the time of] minhah, food for one meal.  
3) Rabbi Yose says: at all times we may save food for three meals. 

Explanation
Section one:  If a fire breaks out and threatens to destroy food, one may save only enough food for Shabbat itself.  It is forbidden to save food that will not be used until after Shabbat.  It is permitted to save three meals for a person if the food is fit for a person and sufficient food for animals, if the food is fit for animals.  
Section two:  The mishnah now illustrates when three meals may be saved.  The principle is simple:  one can save food for as many meals as will be eaten on Shabbat, assuming that a person will eat three meals.  Therefore, if the fire breaks out before the evening meal, then three meals may be saved.  If in the morning, then two meals may be saved and if at minhah time (in the afternoon) then only enough for one meal may be saved.
Section three:  Rabbi Yose holds that the measure of food which may be saved remains the same no matter when the fire breaks out.
