Kilayim, Chapter Five, Mishnah Eight

Introduction 
Our mishnah returns to discuss what types of species are considered to be kilayim in a vineyard.

Mishnah Eight
1) One who allows thorns to remain growing in a vineyard:
a) Rabbi Eliezer says: he [thereby] prohibits [the vineyard]. 
b) But the sages say: he does not prohibit except if it something that is generally allowed to grow.   
2) Iris, ivy, and the king’s lily, and all manner of seeds are not kilayim in a vineyard.
3) [As for] hemp: Rabbi Tarfon said: it is not kilayim, 
a) But the sages say it is kilayim.   
4) Artichokes are kilayim in a vineyard.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Rabbi Eliezer, thorns are considered to be kilayim in a vineyard because in certain regions, according to the Talmud in Arabia, they grow thorns in the fields as camel fodder.  Therefore, one who sees thorns growing in his vineyard and doesn’t remove them has caused the vineyard to become prohibited.  The sages disagree and hold that unless that species is generally allowed to grow, then it cannot be considered kilayim in a vineyard. Since most people do not allow thorns to grow, they are not considered kilayim in a vineyard.
Section two:  This section further illustrates this principle. Iris, ivy and king’s lily are not generally grown for food, even for animal food, and hence they are not kilayim in a vineyard.  Neither are any other types of seeds—only grain and vegetables count as kilayim in a vineyard.
Section three:  Hemp is not kilayim in a vineyard according to Rabbi Tarfon but it is according to the sages.  Assumedly the sages think that it does count as food and that most people would grow it, and therefore it can be kilayim in a vineyard.
Section four:  Artichokes count as a vegetable and are therefore kilayim in a vineyard.  They are also one of my favorite Friday night appetizers, but that is not why they are kilayim.
