Parah, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
1) An earthenware vessel does not defile another such vessel, but [it does defile] a liquid.
2) And when the liquid becomes unclean it defile the vessel. 
3) Behold [the vessel] would say [to the liquid], "That which defiled you did not defile me, but you did defile me."

Explanation
Section one: This mishnah is nearly the same as yesterday's mishnah, but with a slightly different subject. An impure earthenware vessel does not convey impurity to another earthenware vessel. 
Section two: However, it does convey impurity to a liquid, which will in turn defile the other vessel.
Section three: This time the vessel is talking. Kind of like Beauty and the Beast!
