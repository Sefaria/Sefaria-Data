
Mishnah Two
1) How is this so?
a) If [the buyer] drew the produce away from [the seller] but did not give over the money, he cannot retract.
b) If [the buyer] gave the money but did not draw the produce away from [the seller], he can retract.
(1) But they said:  “He that exacted punishment from the generation of the flood and the generation of the dispersion (at the time of the Tower of Babel) will exact punishment from one who does not keep by his word.
2) Rabbi Shimon says:  “He that has the money has the upper hand.”

Explanation
The examples given in section one demonstrate the rules learned in the previous mishnah.  For instance if Reuven is selling produce to Shimon and Reuven takes the produce into his possession but Shimon does not pay the money, neither of them can retract.  Even if for example the price should go way down, Reuven still owes Shimon the money that was agreed upon at the time of the sale.  If, however, Reuven paid Shimon and Shimon did not give him the produce, either can retract the sale. If, for instance, the price of the produce should go up, Shimon can renegotiate the sale.  However, the mishnah adds that although reneging is legal, God will eventually punish those who do not keep their word.  
Rabbi Shimon disagrees with part of the opinion in section one. According to Rabbi Shimon the one who holds the money, i.e. the seller, can change his mind until the  buyer draws the produce to him.  The buyer may not, however, change his mind once he has paid the money.  According to the previous opinion (section one) if the produce had not been given over to the buyer, either the buyer or seller could change their mind.  

Questions for Further Thought:
 If the Rabbis thought that God will punish those who do not stand by their word, why didn’t they say that if one had already paid the money he cannot retract the sale?  
 What might be a possible connection between those of the generations of the Flood and the Dispersion and those who don’t keep their word?
