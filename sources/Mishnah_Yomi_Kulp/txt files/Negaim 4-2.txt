Negaim, Chapter Four, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Today's mishnah compares the rules regarding the sign of "quick flesh" with the sign of spreading.

Mishnah Two
1) There are [laws] that apply to the quick flesh that do not apply to the spreading, while other restrictions apply to the spreading  and do not apply to the quick flesh. 
2) That quick flesh causes uncleanness at the beginning, it causes uncleanness whatever its color, and it is never a sign of cleanness.  
3) There are [laws] that apply to the spreading, for the spreading causes uncleanness however small  its extent, it causes uncleanness in all forms of negaim and also where it is outside the leprosy sign, and these laws do not apply to the quick flesh. 

Explanation
Section one: An introductory statement.
Section two: Quick flesh can be an initial sign of a nega. The color can be any color, even black. And even if the entire body is covered with quick flesh, he is still impure, whereas if the spreading covers the whole body, he is pure (see yesterday's mishnah).
Section three: For quick flesh to be a sign of impurity it must be at least the size of a lentil, whereas the spreading can be even to the smallest extent. Quick flesh is a sign of impurity only in skin negaim and those found on the bald head or forehead. Finally, quick flesh is a sign only if it appears in the nega. Appearance of quick flesh elsewhere on the body is not a sign of a nega.
