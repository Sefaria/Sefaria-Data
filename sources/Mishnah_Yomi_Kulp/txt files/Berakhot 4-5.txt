Berakhot, Chapter Four, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a person who is traveling on a donkey when it comes time to recite the Shmoneh Esrei.
As an aside, it is in this mishnah that we learn that while praying one should face Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. This is connected to I Kings 8:44, “When Your people take the field against their enemy by whatever way You send them, and they pray to the Lord in the direction of the city which You have chosen and of the House which I have built to Your name.”  

Mishnah Five
1) If he is riding on a donkey, he gets down [and prays.] 
2) If he is unable to get down he should turn his face [towards Jerusalem], and if he cannot turn his face.

Explanation
Section one:  It is preferable, if possible, to pray while standing still.  Therefore, he should get off the donkey before praying.
Section two:  If he cannot, he should at least try to face Jerusalem.  If he can’t even do this, he should at least direct his heart towards Jerusalem and to the Holy of Holies, the most important part of the Temple.
