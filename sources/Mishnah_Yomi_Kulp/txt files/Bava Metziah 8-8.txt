Mishnah Eight
1) If one rented a house to his fellow by the year and the year was made a leap year, the extra month goes to the tenant.
a) If he rented it by the month and the year was made a leap year, the extra month goes to the owner.  
b) It once happened in Tzippori that a person leased a bath-house from his fellow at “twelve golden dinars a year, one dinar per month”, and [when the year became a leap year] the case came before Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel and Rabbi Yose, and they said:  “Let them share the extra month.”

Explanation—Mishnah Eight
In the time of the mishnah there was no fixed calendar as we have in our day.  Rather each year they would decide whether to make a leap year of 13 months or not.  The Hebrew months are lunar months, of either 28 or 29 days, making a total of 354 days per year.  Since this is 11 days short or a regular solar year, the Hebrew year must receive an additional month about once every three years.  
If one leased a house by a yearly wage and the year became a leap year, the tenant benefits by receiving an extra month for free.  Since the terms of the contract were for a year, the tenant receives a year, whether it is a leap year or not.  If, however, he leased the house by the month, and the year became a leap year, he must pay for the extra month.
In the story (1c), the rental agreement for the bath-house contained ambiguous language, stating both the yearly rate and the monthly rate.  Since it was unclear whether the owner had rented the house on a yearly or monthly rate, they split the cost of the extra month.
