Mishnah Two
1) If a ladleful of corpse-mold was scattered about in a house, the house is unclean   
a) But Rabbi Shimon declares it clean.   
2) If a quarter [of a log] of blood was absorbed in [the ground] of a house, the house is clean. 
3) If it was absorbed by a garment: if the garment is washed and a quarter [of a log] of blood emerges from it, it is unclean, if not, it is clean, since anything absorbed that cannot emerge is clean.

Explanation
Section one: In 2:1we learned that a ladleful of corpse mold causes impurity in an ohel. The sages say that even though the mold was mixed in with the dust and dirt of the house, as long as the requisite quantity of corpse is found, the house is unclean. Rabbi Shimon, however, holds that since there is a mixture of corpse-mold and dust, the house is clean.
Section two: The sages agree that if blood is mixed in with the ground of the house, the house is clean. As we shall learn in section three, if blood is absorbed in something from which it cannot be expelled, the blood no longer transmits impurity. 
Section three: The purity of the garment into which the blood has been absorbed depends on whether the blood can be removed from the garment. If it can be removed by laundering the garment, then the garment does not defile in an ohel. However, the garment itself is impure because it came into contact with a quarter of a log of blood. 
As far as how one can test if a quarter of a log of blood came out of the garment, one would take a measured amount of water and launder the garment in it. Then he would bring the same measure of water, less a quarter of a log, and put in that water a quarter of a log of blood. If the water looks the same, then a quarter of a log emerged. If the water that was used for laundering has less of a red color, then the garment with the blood does not defile in an ohel.
