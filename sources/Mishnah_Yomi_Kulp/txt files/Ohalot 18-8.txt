Ohalot, Chapter Eighteen, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
In yesterday's mishnah we learned that a Jew wishing to buy a home from a non-Jew must examine the home to make sure that the non-Jew had not buried there a miscarried fetus. Today's mishnah discusses where they must check. 
Warning: there is a strong "yucky" factor to this mishnah. 

Mishnah Eight
1) What do they examine? Deep drains and foul-smelling waters. 
2) Bet Shammai say: even garbage dumps and crumbled earth.   
3) Bet Hillel say: any place where a pig or a weasel can go requires no examination.    

Explanation
Section one: The first opinion seems to imply that the fetus might be cast into drains and other types of drainage ditches.
Section two: Bet Shammai adds garbage dumps and soft crumbled earth. Note that both opinions agree that the non-Jew would not actually bury the fetus in the floor of the house, for digging up such a floor would not be easy. 
Section three: Bet Hillel adds a leniency that doesn't seem to disagree with the above opinion (this is unusual). The Jew need not check any place where a pig or weasel might go, because if the fetus had been buried there we could assume that a pig or weasel either ate it or dragged it somewhere else [I told you this was yucky].
