Niddah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four 
1) Anyone who is fit to try capital cases is also fit to try monetary cases.
a) But there are those who are fit to try monetary suits and and unfit to try capital cases.
2) Anyone who is eligible to act as judge is eligible to serve as a witness.
a) But there may be one who is eligible to act as witness and not as judge.

Explanation
Section one: The laws regarding who may adjudicate a capital case are more stringent than those for monetary cases. For instance, a convert or a mamzer cannot judge capital cases (see Sanhedrin 4:2). 
Section two: Similarly, the laws regarding who can serve as a judge are stricter than those for a witness.  For instance, an unlearned person can serve as witness, but not as a judge.
