Mishnah Six
1) One who carries the rope in his hand, 
a) If in his usual manner, the mixture is valid; 
b) But if not in his usual manner, it is invalid. 
2) The question was sent on to Yavneh on three festivals and on the third festival, it was ruled that the mixture was valid, as a temporary measure.  

Explanation
Section one: If after filling the water into a jar that was hanging from a rope he returned in his usual way and didn't go out of the way to return the rope somewhere else, the mixture remains valid.
But if he went out of his way to carry the rope somewhere else, the mixture is invalid because this is considered work.
Section two: The question about walking the rope out of its way and was asked (according to the Tosefta by pilgrims from Asia Minor) for three consecutive festivals in the yeshiva in Yavneh and finally on the third festival they gave an answer. The answer was that as a temporary measure they will validate cases in which this was done in the past, but in the future if one carries the rope out of its way, it will invalidate the water. 
As an aside, this mishnah is, according to some scholars (notably Gedaliah Alon), evidence that there was a center of rabbinic learning in Yavneh before the destruction of the Temple. Yavneh's ascent as a famous and legendary rabbinic academy seems to have largely occurred after the destruction (this was where R. Yohanan ben Zakkai went after the destruction) but it seems that there were some sages there even before the destruction and that some Jews turned to those sages with questions on their way to the Temple in Jerusalem. However, beyond these scant details, there is little we really know.
