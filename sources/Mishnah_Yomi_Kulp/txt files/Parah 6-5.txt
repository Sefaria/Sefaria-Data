Mishnah Five
1) One who diverts a spring into a wine vat or into pools, the water is invalid for zavim and metzoraim.
2) And also for the preparation of the hatat water.
3) Because it was not drawn into a vessel.

Explanation
Section one: In this situation, a person diverts water from a spring into a wine vat or into some pools and after the vat or pools are full, he stops the connection with the spring such that the water is no longer connected to its source.
Zavim—people with abnormal genital discharge, cannot use this water because they need living water. 
For metzoraim, people with skin afflictions, they slaughter a bird above living water and sprinkle him with the water. This also requires living water. 
Section two: It is also not valid for the preparation of hatat water.
Section three: This is the reason why this water cannot be used for any of these three rituals. The water in the vat or pools is no longer live water as it was when it was in the spring. And, the water is also not considered to be in a vessel for vats and pools are not vessels. Therefore, this water is invalid for any ritual requiring "living waters."
