Mishnah Ten
1) The waters of the Karmiyon and the waters of Pugah are unfit, because they are marsh waters. 
2) The waters of the Jordan and the waters of the Yarmuk are unfit, because they are mixed waters. 
a) And the following are mixed waters: a fit kind and an unfit kind that were mixed together. 
3) If two kinds that are fit were mixed together both remain fit: 
a) Rabbi Judah says that they are unfit.

Explanation
Section one: According to Albeck, who bases his interpretation on a medieval Talmudic dictionary (the Arukh), the Karmiyon and the Pugah are the same rivers as the Amanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, mentioned in II Kings 5:12. The mishnah rules that these rivers are too marshy to be considered "living waters."
Section two: The Jordan and the Yarmuk are mixtures of valid living waters and marshy waters, therefore they cannot be used in the red cow or other rituals.
Section three: If two rivers both of which contain "living waters" mix together their water can be used. Rabbi Judah disagrees because he holds that "mixed waters" are always invalid. It seems that Rabbi Judah here sticks to some received tradition. He received the tradition that mixed waters are invalid, and he says that this tradition is true even if the mixture was made by two rivers of living waters. In other words, he remains true to the received tradition even if it doesn't really make any rational sense.
