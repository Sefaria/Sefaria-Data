2) They transgress the commandment, (1) “You will not give him your money upon interest” (Leviticus 25:37), and (2  “You shall not take usury from him” (Leviticus 25:36) and (3) “You shall not be to him as a creditor” (Exodus 22:24), and (4) “Nor shall you place upon him usury” (ibid.) and (5) “You shall put a stumbling block before the blind, and you will fear your God, I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:14).

Explanation
Section one:  When a loan with interest is executed it is not only the lender and borrower who violate a negative commandment but everyone involved in the loan.  According the Sages, even the scribe transgresses a negative commandment if he draws up a document which contains in it a usurious loan. 
Section two:  The mishnah now lists the specific transgressions that a person commits when a loan with interest is executed.  Since there are several verses in the Torah that forbid lending in interest the Rabbis understood that each verse added another commandment.  One loan with interest can therefore cause a person to violate several commandments.
In the Talmud it is explained that the lender violates all of these commandments, the borrower violates the first two and number five.  The witnesses violate number four and according to the sages the scribe violates number four as well.    

Questions for Further Thought:
