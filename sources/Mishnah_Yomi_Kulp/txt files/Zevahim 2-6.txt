Zevahim, Chapter Three, Mishnah One
 
Introduction
In chapter two mishnah one we learned that only a fit priest can receive the blood, carry it to the altar and sprinkle it on the altar. Today we learn that anyone can slaughter the animal. 

Mishnah One
1) All unfit persons who slaughtered, their slaughtering is valid, for slaughtering is valid [even when performed] by non-priests, and by women, and by slaves, and by the unclean, even in the case of most-holy sacrifices, provided that unclean [persons] do not touch the flesh.
2) Therefore they invalidate [the sacrifice] by an [illegitimate] intention.
3) And in all of these cases, if they received the blood [in order to eat the sacrifice] after the prescribed time, or outside of the prescribed place, if there remains [in the animal] life-blood, a fit person should go back and receive the blood.

Explanation
Section one: The first action in the process of sacrificing an animal can be performed by anyone, and not necessarily just a male priest. This is true for all sacrifices, even most holy sacrifices. There is one caveat—if an unclean person slaughters the animal, they must not touch the flesh. The animal is not susceptible to uncleanness but once it has been slaughtered, its flesh is.
Section two: Since anyone can slaughter the animal, if such a person has an illegitimate intention he/she invalidates the sacrifice. In other words, since they can perform these actions, the same rules apply to them as apply to priests when performing the other three actions.
Section three: Those people listed in section one cannot receive the blood of the sacrificed animal. Therefore, if they do receive the blood and while doing so have an illegitimate intention, it does not automatically render the sacrifice invalid. If there is still blood flowing from the animal’s neck, the life-blood, then a valid priest can come and receive the blood and bring it to the altar and thereby preserve the validity of the sacrifice.
