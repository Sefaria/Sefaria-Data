Orlah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Fifteen

Introduction
This mishnah contains the same debate that was found in yesterday’s mishnah, except yesterday the mishnah dealt with leaven and fermentation, and today the mishnah deals with seasonings. Again the majority view holds that the two forbidden substances, terumah and kilayim, combine to cause the dish to be prohibited to non-priests, whereas Rabbi Shimon holds that the substances do not join together and the dish is permitted even to priests.
Since the mishnah is basically exactly the same as yesterday’s mishnah, there is new commentary below—just look at yesterday’s commentary. 

Mishnah Fifteen
Seasonings of terumah and of kilayim of the vineyard that fell into a dish, and there is not enough of one to season, nor is there of the other to season, but together they seasoned:
1) It [the dish] is prohibited to non-priests but permitted to priests.   
2) Rabbi Shimon declares it permitted to non-priests and to priests.
