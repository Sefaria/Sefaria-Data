Mishnah Three
1) The insides of a melon and the discarded leaves of a vegetable of terumah: 
a) Rabbi Dosa permits [their] use to non-priests, and the Sages forbid it.   
2) Five ewes, their fleeces weighing each a mina and a half, are subject to [the law of] the first of the fleece, according to Rabbi Dosa. 
a) But the Sages say: “Five ewes [are subject] whatever [their fleeces weigh].”

Explanation
Section one:  Terumah, one of the agricultural offerings, may be eaten only by priests.  According to Rabbi Dosa, the parts of terumah produce that are not commonly eaten are permitted to non-priests.  Since these are not considered food, and the laws of terumah are only applicable to food, these things may be eaten by non-priests.  The Sages forbid this.  Presumably, according to the Sages since people do occasionally eat these things, the laws of terumah apply to them as well.
Section two:  According to Deuteronomy 18:4, the first shearings of a sheep must be given to the priest.  In our mishnah Rabbi Dosa and the Sages disagree about the minimum weight of the fleeces of the sheep which would cause them to be subject to these laws.  According to Rabbi Dosa a person is not liable to give these shearings to the priest unless he has five female sheep and each fleece weighs a mina and a half, about 150 grams.  Less than this is not even considered “shearings”.  The Sages disagree.  According to them as long as five female sheep are sheared, he must give the first shearings to the priest, no matter what the weight of the wool.
