Explanation—Mishnah Nine
In the previous mishnah we learned that one who hirers an animal or one who is being paid to watch it is not liable if it was injured, taken captive or died a natural death.  In our mishnah we learn that the hirer or paid guardian are not liable in any case where something happened to the animal that was beyond his control. This is called “ones” in Hebrew, and it means an unavoidable accident.  This mishnah deals with attacks by wild animals on a flock that are out of the hirer or paid guardian’s control to stop. 
Section one:  An attack made by one wolf is not considered to be an unavoidable accident for the shepherd should have been able to fend him off.  A shepherd could not, however, fend off two wolves and therefore an attack made by two wolves is considered unavoidable.  Rabbi Judah adds that if even one wolf attacked at a time when wolves were commonly attacking, the shepherd would not be able to fend it off and it would be therefore be considered an unavoidable accident.
Section two:  Dogs are less dangerous than wolves and therefore even two dogs are not considered to be an unavoidable accident.  Yadua (the name of a Sage) the Babylonian in the name of Rabbi Meir qualifies this law to a situation where both dogs attacked from the same direction.  If they attacked from different directions it is considered to be an unavoidable accident.
Section three:  An attack by bandits is considered to be an unavoidable accident.  When the previous mishnah stated that a hirer and an unpaid guardian are liable if the object was stolen the meaning is that they are liable if it was stolen by thievery.  If the animal was stolen by an armed robber that is similar to the case where it was taken captive and they are not liable.
Section four:  An attack by any of the predatory wild animals listed here is considered to constitute an unavoidable accident.  
Section five:  The mishnah clarifies that an unavoidable accident is only when the animal or bandit attacked the flock when the flock was grazing in a safe area.  If, however, the paid guardian or hirer took the flock to an area known to be unsafe and then the flock was attacked, they are liable.  Since they were the ones who brought the animal to danger, they are liable.
