Mishnah Two
1) Anything that is doubtfully pure in the case of terumah is regarded as clean in the case of the hatat waters. 
2) Anything that is "suspended" where terumah is concerned, the hatat waters are poured out. 
a) If clean things were handled on account of it, they must be "suspended." 
3) Wooden lattice work is clean in respect of holy food, terumah, and the hatat waters. 
4) Rabbi Eliezer says: Loosely connected wood is unclean in respect of hatat waters. 

Explanation
Section one: There are cases in which terumah is doubtfully pure/impure (we shall learn of these in Toharot (next tractate) 4:2. In these cases the terumah must be burned. If the same type of doubt occurs with regard to hatat waters, they remain pure.
Section two: There are cases in which the terumah is "suspended" meaning it is neither burned nor eaten. If the same type of issue occurs with hatat waters, the waters must be poured out. 
If these hatat waters that were supposed to be poured out were used to purify a person, and then he touched clean food, this too must be "suspended." The food cannot be eaten or burned, as if it was terumah.
Section three: Wooden lattice work is not considered to be a vessel, nor is it made for sitting or lying upon. Therefore, it is not considered impure with regard to matters of holy food, terumah or hatat waters.
Section four: According to Rabbi Eliezer, occasionally a person will sit on a configuration of loosely connected wood. Since people sit on this wood work, one who does is impure with regard to the preparation of hatat waters. That is to say, a person who touches this wood will be invalid, even if the wood has not been defiled.
There are other interpretations of what "loosely connected wood" is. Albeck explains that it is the same thing referred to in section three, and that Rabbi Eliezer disagrees with that opinion
