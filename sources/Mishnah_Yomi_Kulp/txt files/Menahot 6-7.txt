Menahot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah deals with how well the flour must be sifted for certain minhah offerings. 

Mishnah Seven
1) The omer was sifted through thirteen sieves, the two loaves through twelve, and the showbread through eleven.  
2) Rabbi Shimon says: there was no prescribed number for them, rather they brought fine flour and sifted it as much as was necessary, as it is said, “You shall take fine flour and bake it” (Leviticus 24:5) [you should not bake it] until it is sifted as much as is necessary.  

Explanation
Section one: The omer was sifted thirteen times, each time making the flour a bit finer. The two loaves for Shavuot were sifted a bit less and showbread was sifted only (!) eleven times. This accords with what we learned in yesterday’s mishnah—the greatest amount of grain was needed for the omer, a little bit less for the two loaves and the least for the showbread.
Section two: Rabbi Shimon holds that there was no prescribed amount for how much the showbread had to be sifted or how much grain had to be used (yesterday’s mishnah). Rather, whatever was needed was used. He proves this from a verse which states that the flour must be fine, but does not give a prescribed amount.
