Introduction
Our mishnah deals with a dead sheretz found among the olives of the olive press. 

Mishnah Eight
1) If a [dead] sheretz was found in the milling stones, only the place that it has touched becomes unclean.
a) But if moisture was running, all become unclean.   
2) If it was found on the leaves, the olive-press men shall be asked whether they can say, "we did not touch it." 
3) If it touched the mass [of olives], even by as little as the bulk of a barley grain, [the mass becomes] unclean. 

Explanation
Section one: If a dead sheretz, which causes impurity, is found in the milling stones which are used to crush the olives before they are pressed, only the olives that the sheretz touches is impure. The rest of the olives that touch these olives remain pure because each olive is not the size of an egg such that it could transmit impurity to the other olives. Furthermore, each olive is considered to be a separate entity. 
However, if the moisture is running over all the mill stones it transmits purity to everything and all of the olives are impure. This is because all of the olives are considered one lump. 
Section two: In this case the sheretz is found on the leaves that cover the olives. These leaves are not food and they are not susceptible to impurity. Therefore, they themselves are not the problem. The problem is that the leaves were put there by somebody.  We must ask the men who work at the olive press whether they touched the sheretz. If they admit that they did not, then the olives are pure. In other words, these men are trusted.
Section three: However, if the sheretz touched the mass of olives that are all stuck together, then all of the olives are considered unclean. This is because they are all considered to be connected.
