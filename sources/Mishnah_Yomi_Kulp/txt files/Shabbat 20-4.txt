Shabbat, Chapter Twenty, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah discusses cleaning out a trough for an animal on Shabbat.  The mishnah is placed here due to the end of yesterday’s mishnah which also discussed a trough.

Mishnah Four 
1) One may rake out [the trough] for a stall ox, and move [the remnants] aside for the sake of a grazing [ox], the words of Rabbi Dosa.
a) But the sages prohibit it. 
2) One may take [food] from one animal and place it before another animal on Shabbat.

Explanation
Section one:  One may sweep out the trough of the remnants that are left over after the a previous feeding so that the old food the ox would not eat before doesn’t become mixed with the food given to it in the current feeding.  A “stall ox” is one that is being fattened up by giving it high quality food. Since it is rather “fussy”, Rabbi Dosa allows its trough to be cleaned out on Shabbat.  A “grazing” ox is less fussy and used to dirtier food and hence one may not completely rake out the trough on its behalf.  However, one may move the remnants to the side so that they don’t get mixed up with the next feeding.
The sages prohibit both of these things because of sweeping and raking on Shabbat. The problem is that by sweeping or raking one may come to fill up a hole, an activity prohibited on Shabbat.
Section two:   One may move food from one trough to another on Shabbat.  We might have thought that this is prohibited because it is carrying without purpose.  However, since one animal will generally eat food which has already been put in front of another animal, this is not considered “carrying without a purpose” and it is permitted.
