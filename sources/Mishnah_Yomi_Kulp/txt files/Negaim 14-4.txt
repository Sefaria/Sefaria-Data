Negaim, Chapter Fourteen, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four 
1) There are three who must shave their hair, and their shaving of it is a commandment: the nazirite, the metzora, and the Levites.   
2) If any of these cut their hair but not with a razor, or if they left even two remaining hairs, their act is of no validity.

Explanation
Section one: The Torah commands three categories of people to shave their hair. The metzora, whom we have been discussing in the previous mishnayot.
The Nazirite at the end of his term of naziriteship. See Numbers 6:18 and Mishnah Nazir 6:7.
The Levites when they were first dedicated to service. See Numbers 8:7.
Section two: They must all shave their hair with a razor and not cut it with scissors. And if even two hairs are left behind, they have not fulfilled the mitzvah.
