Mishnah Ten
1) If one gave over his water to someone who was unclean, it is invalid.
a) But if to a clean one it is valid. 
2) Rabbi Eliezer says: even if it was entrusted to an unclean man it is valid, provided the owner did no other work in the meantime.

Explanation
Section one: If a person gives over the water he is watching to an unclean person to watch, the water is invalid because we can't trust that it remained pure. However, if he gives it to a clean person the water remains valid. In addition, the clean person can perform work while watching the water since it is not his water.
Section two: According to Rabbi Eliezer, if he gives the water to an unclean person, the water remains valid, for we consider the water to have stayed in the possession of the owner. However, this leniency is accompanied by a stringency. Since the water is still in the possession of the owner, if he does work before the mixing, he renders it invalid.
In contrast, if he gave it to a clean person, the clean person assumes possession and if the owner does work, it does not render it invalid.
