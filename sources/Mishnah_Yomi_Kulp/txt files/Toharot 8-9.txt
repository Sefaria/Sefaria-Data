Toharot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Nine

Mishnah Nine
1) If a stick is completely covered with unclean liquid, as soon as it has touched the [water in the] mikveh, it becomes clean, the words of Rabbi Joshua. 
a) But the sages say: only when the whole of it is immersed.   
2) A flow from one vessel to the other or a slope of dripping moisture does not serve as a connective either for uncleanness or for cleanness.   
a) A pool of water serves as a connective in respect both of uncleanness and cleanness.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Rabbi Joshua as soon as any part of the stick covered with impure liquids is put in the mikveh, it is pure. The water of the mikveh "flows" through the impure liquids on the stick and purifies them, even before it actually touches them. 
The sages rule more strictly. The entire stick must be immersed for it to be pure.
Section two: "Flow" refers to liquid that is being poured from an upper vessel to a lower vessel. The slope is the sides of the vessel, as we learned in yesterday's mishnah. In both of these cases we do not consider the lower liquid to be attached to the upper liquid.
As an aside, the purity of "flow" was a big debate among ancient Jews. In one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, called Miktzat Maase Torah, the author complains that "you" (this refers to the other Jews with whom he doesn't agree) say that a "flow" is pure. The fact that in our Mishnah the rabbis do indeed say that the "flow" is pure, has been a major proof for scholars who wish to say that the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls opposed the Pharisees (with whom the rabbis certainly did identify).
While the sloping or flowing liquid does not serve as a connective, a standing pool of water does. If one side is impure, the entire body is pure.
