Negaim, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Nine

Mishnah Nine
1) One who winds [a thread] from one coil to another, or from one spool to another, or from the upper beam to the lower beam, and so also in the case of the two sides of a shirt, if a nega appears on the one, the other remains clean. 
2) If it appears on the shedded woof or on the standing warp, they become susceptible to the uncleanness of negaim immediately. 
a) Rabbi Shimon says: the warp may contract uncleanness only if it is closely ordered.

Explanation
Section one: If one winds a thread from one coil to another, and a nega appears on one coil, the other is still clean. The same is true if a thread connects two spools or the upper and lower beams of a loom. Shirts were made by sewing together two sides. If a thread connects the two sides, and one side is impure through a nega, the other side remains clean. In other words, in all of these cases, a thread does not serve to connect the two items at hand. 
Section two: The "shedded woof" refers to the woof threads that have already been woven into the warp but have not yet been straightened and tightened together. The "standing warp" are the threads that lie on the loom and wait for the woof. According to the first opinion, these threads are now susceptible to impurity.
Rabbi Shimon says that the threads must be closely ordered before they are susceptible to uncleanness.
