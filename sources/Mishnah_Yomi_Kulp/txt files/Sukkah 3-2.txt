Sukkah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Two

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with the hadas, the myrtle.  Many of the details of this mishnah are the same as those in yesterday’s mishnah concerning the lulav.  I will comment only on aspects of the hadas that differ from those of the lulav.

Mishnah Two
1) A stolen or withered hadas is invalid.
2) One [that came from] an asherah or a condemned city is invalid. 
3) If its tip was broken off, or its leaves were detached, or its berries were more numerous than its leaves, it is invalid. 
a) But if he diminished them it is valid. 
b) But many not diminish them on the festival.

Explanation
Sections one and two:  See sections one and two of yesterday’s mishnah.
Section three:  The first two rules of this section are the same as that in section three of yesterday’s mishnah.  The third is unique to the hadas.  Some hadasim have berries attached to them.  While hiking last week I think I actually saw a wild hadas that had many berries (I’m not a botanist, so I’m not sure it really was a hadas). They weren’t really berries as much as little black things that looked liked capers.  In any case, too many of these berries renders the otherwise valid hadas invalid.  However, the hadas is invalid only if the berries are still on the branch. If he removes the berries, the hadas again becomes valid.  Finally, the mishnah states that he may not remove the berries on the festival itself.  This is because it is forbidden to “make a vessel” on a festival or on Shabbat and by making an invalid hadas valid, he is making a vessel.
