Parah, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a person who wants to draw water for a hatat mixture and at the same time draw some water for himself. How can he do it without invalidating the hatat water?

Mishnah Five
1) One who is drawing water for his own use and for the mixture of the hatat, he must draw for himself first and fasten [the bucket] to the carrying pole and then he can draw the water for the hatat. 
a) If he drew first the water for the hatat and then he drew the water for himself, it is invalid. 
2) He must put his own behind him and that for the hatat before him, and if he put that for the hatat behind him it is invalid. 
3) If both were for the hatat, he may put one before him and one behind him and both are valid, since it is impossible to do otherwise. 

Explanation
Section one:  First he must draw his own water and then attach it to the pole that he uses to carry the water, and then he can draw the water for the hatat.  
If he drew water first for the hatat and then drew for himself, the hatat water will be invalid because he performed work in between drawing the hatat water and mixing it with the ashes.
Section two: The hatat waters have to go in front of him where they can be better watched. This is derived from the word, "for a watch" found in Numbers 19:9. 
Section three: If he has two jars of hatat water that he needs to carry then he has no choice but to carry one behind him. Both remain valid.
