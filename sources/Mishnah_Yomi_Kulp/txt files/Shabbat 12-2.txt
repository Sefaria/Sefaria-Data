Shabbat, Chapter Twelve, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah deals with plowing, reaping and binding sheaves. 
 
Mishnah Two 
1) He who plows any amount, or who weeds, or who prunes [trees], or who cuts off young shoots, no matter the amount, is liable. 
2) He who gathers wood:  
a) if in order to effect an improvement, [he is liable] for any amount; 
b) if for lighting a fire, as much as is required for boiling a light egg. 
3) He who collects grasses: 
a) if to effect an improvement, [he is liable] for any amount; 
b) if for an animal, as much as fits in a kid’s mouth.  

Explanation
Section one:  Plowing is one of the categories of forbidden labor mentioned in 7:2.  Weeding, pruning or cutting off young shoots are not listed in that mishnah.  According to some commentators, these are prohibited because they are similar to “plowing”. According to others they are similar to “planting” because they are means by which a person helps her plants grow.  In all of these cases, a person is liable no matter how much work they perform.  
Section two:  Gathering wood is considered by commentators to be forbidden because of “binding sheaves”, a forbidden labor listed in 7:2.  If she gathers wood from a tree in order to improve the tree, then she is liable for any amount, similar to those labors listed above.  However, if she gathers wood in order to light a stove, she is only liable if she gathers enough wood to light a fire sufficient to cook an egg (see above, 8:5).
Section three:  If a person gathers grasses in order to improve the land, then she is liable for “plowing” and she is therefore liable for any amount.  However, if she does so in order to feed an animal, then she needs to collect enough to fill the mouth of a kid (a young goat, as in “had gadya”).  As above, she is liable because of “binding sheaves.”
