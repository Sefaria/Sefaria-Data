Mikvaot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah One

Introduction
The ninth chapter deals completely with the issue of what blocks immersion.
Today's mishnah begins with what blocks immersion for a person. The end of the chapter (5-7) deals with what blocks immersion in vessels. 

Mishnah One
1) The following block [immersion] in the case of a person: threads of wool, threads of flax and the ribbons on the heads of girls.  
2) Rabbi Judah says: those of wool or of hair do not interpose, because water enters through them. 

Explanation
Section one: If a girl wears threads of wool, flax or other types of ribbons in her hair, they block her immersion. 
Section two: According to Rabbi Judah, threads of wool or hair do not block the water from entering. Therefore, her immersion is successful
