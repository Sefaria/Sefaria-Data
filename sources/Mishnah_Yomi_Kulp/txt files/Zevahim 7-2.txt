Zevahim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah is similar to yesterday’s mishnah, but the topic here is the olah. 
 
Mishnah Two
1) If an olah of a bird is offered above [the red line], with the rites of an olah [and] in the name of a olah, it is fit.
2) With the rites of an olah [but] in the name of a hatat, it is fit, but does not count for its owner’s obligation.   
3) [If he offers it] with the rites of a hatat [and] in the name of a olah; 
4) [Or] with the rites of a hatat [and] in the name of a hatat, it is unfit. 
5) If he offers it below, [even] with the rites of any of these, it is unfit.

Explanation
Section one: This olah is offered in the manner in which it is supposed to be offered and therefore it is valid.
Section two: If an olah is offered with the rites of an olah but for the sake of it being a hatat, it is still fit and can be burned on the altar. However, it doesn’t count for discharging the owner of his obligation, as we explained in chapter six, mishnah seven. The owners will need to bring another hatat.
Sections three and four: However, if he uses the rites of a hatat, it is invalid.
Section five: As with the hatat, if he sprinkles the blood in the wrong place, it is invalid, even if he uses the rites of the olah and does it for the sake of an olah.
