Parah, Chapter Five, Mishnah One

Introduction
Our mishnah talks about measures taken to ensure the purity of the vessel into which the ashes and water were mixed.

Mishnah One
1) He who brings the earthen vessel for the hatat must immerse, and spend the night by the furnace. 
a) Rabbi Judah says: he may also bring it from the house and it is valid, for all are deemed trustworthy in regard to the hatat. 
2) In the case of terumah one may open the furnace and take out [the vessel]. 
a) Rabbi Shimon says: from the second row. 
b) Rabbi Yose says: from the third row.

Explanation
Section one: The person who is going to bring the earthenware vessel to be used for the hatat (the red cow) must first immerse himself in a mikveh. When doing so, he must have the specific intent that he will be occupied with the hatat (see Hagigah 2:6). He must sleep next to the furnace in which the vessel is being made to make sure that it is not touched by someone impure. 
Rabbi Judah rules much more leniently for he believes that people can be trusted to preserve the purity of anything to do with the hatat. People recognize the sanctity of the red cow and would not claim that a vessel was pure if it was not.  Therefore, he can even bring it directly from the house in which it was made, without sleeping next to the furnace (might not be so comfortable in the summer).
Section two: When it comes to a vessel made for holding terumah, one need not sleep next to the furnace. However, he should go to the furnace, open it up and take it out himself. He should be able to tell by looking at the vessel whether it had yet been touched. He should not trust the potter's purity.  
Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yose rule more strictly saying that he should take from either the second row of vessels in the furnace or the third row, for it is more likely that these rows have not been touched and therefore have not been defiled.
