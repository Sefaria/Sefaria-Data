Middot, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two 
1) All who entered the Temple Mount entered by the right and went round [to the right] and went out by the left, save for one to whom something had happened, who entered and went round to the left. 
2) [He was asked]: “Why do you go round to the left?” 
a) [If he answered] “Because I am a mourner,” [they said to him], “May He who dwells in this house comfort you.” 
3) [If he answered] “Because I am excommunicated” [they said]: “May He who dwells in this house inspire them to draw you near again,” the words of Rabbi Meir. 
a) Rabbi Yose to him: you make it seem as if they treated him unjustly.  
b) Rather [they should say]: “May He who dwells in this house inspire you to listen to the words of your colleagues so that they may draw you near again.”

Explanation
Section one: Most people would enter the Temple Mount on the right side of the Southern Gates, and they would turn right and eventually come out on the left. The exception was one who was either a mourner or had been excommunicated. They would enter the same way, but they would go around to the left. This seems to have served as a means by which others could tell that something had happened to them and could offer them comfort.
Section two: When people would see others walking around to the left, they would know to ask them what had happened. If the person answered that he was a mourner, they would offer him comfort.
Section three: Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Meir debate what words they would say to a mourner. According to Rabbi Meir they would offer hope that God would inspire the people who had excommunicated him to restore him to his status. Rabbi Yose complains that such a formulation gives the impression that those who had excommunicated him had done so unjustly. Instead, Rabbi Yose formulates words of consolation that place the blame on the excommunicated party, that he should mend his ways in order to be restored to his prior place.
