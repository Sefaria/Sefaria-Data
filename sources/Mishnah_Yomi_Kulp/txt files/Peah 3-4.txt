Peah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Four

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with some more questions that arise concerning giving peah from onions.

Mishnah Four
1) Onions grown for their seed are liable for peah. 
a) But Rabbi Yose exempts them.   
2) Plots of onions [growing] between vegetables: 
a) Rabbi Yose says: peah must be given from each [plot].   
b) But the sages say: from one [plot] for all.

Explanation
Section one:  According to the first opinion, although these onions are harvested not to be food but for their seed to be used to grow more onions, they are still liable for peah. Rabbi Yose disagrees and holds that since when they are harvested they can’t be used for food they are not exempt from peah.
Section two: This is similar to the rules found in mishnah one of our chapter.  Plots of onions are planted between rows of vegetables.  According to Rabbi Yose the vegetables serve to break up the field, making him liable to give peah separately from each plot of onions. According to the other sages, since the vegetables are not liable for peah (since they cannot be stored) and the onions are liable for peah, the vegetables do not serve to break up the field of onions.
