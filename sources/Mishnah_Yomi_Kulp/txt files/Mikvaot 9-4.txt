Mikvaot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Today's mishnah continues the list of things that do not block immersion.

Mishnah Four
1) Pus within the eye, hardened pus within a wound, juice that is moist, moist excrement on the body, excrement inside the finger nail, and a dangling finger nail and the downy hair of a child.
2) [These] are not liable to uncleanness   and do not cause uncleanness. 
3) The membrane which forms over a wound is liable to uncleanness and causes uncleanness. 

Explanation
Section one: All of the things listed here do not cause immersion to be blocked. Note that some of these should be contrasted with the list in mishnah one, for instance moist excrement, which does not block, and dry excrement, which does.
Section two: In addition, all of the items listed above are not considered to be attached to the body. Thus if the body became impure, these things remain pure. And if these things contracted impurity, the rest of the body remains pure.
Section three: In contrast, the scab of a wound is part of the body and its purity status goes along with the rest of the body. If it contracts impurity, a person's whole body is impure and if the body is defiled, it too is defiled.
