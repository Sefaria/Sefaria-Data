Mishnah Six
1) A potters’ egg is fit [as a vessel]. 
a) Rabbi Yose rules that it is unfit. 
2) A hen's egg: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Judah rule it is fit [as a vessel]; 
a) But the sages rule that it is unfit.  

Explanation
Section one: A "potters' egg" is an egg shaped piece of plaster made by the potter and from which he will form a vessel. It has a receptacle. The first opinion holds that this egg is usable for mixing the ashes and water and to sprinkle from it for it is already considered a vessel. Rabbi Yose says that it is not yet a vessel and therefore cannot be used.
Section two: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Judah hold that even a hen's egg is considered a vessel and therefore can be used. However, the other sages (understandably, in my opinion) disagree.
