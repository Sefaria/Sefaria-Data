Niddah, Chapter One, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Today's mishnah offers a qualification to the rule that the women mentioned in mishnayot 3-5 defile only the things that they touched after they noticed that they had their period.

Mishnah Six
1) And of what did they speak  when they said  that "it suffices [for them to reckon] their period of uncleanness from the time [of their discovering of the flow]"? 
a) [This refers to] the first observation,  but after a second observation she defiles retroactively for a period of twenty-four hours. 
2) If she saw the first flow on account of an accident even it suffices for her even a subsequent observation [to reckon her uncleanness from] the time of her [observing of the flow].

Explanation
Section one: The first time one of these women (virgin, nursing woman, pregnant woman or old woman) sees a blood flow, she doesn't retroactively defile anything. But the second time she does, she reverts to the law found in mishnah one of this chapter. Everything she has touched during the previous twenty four hours, or since the last time she examined herself, is considered defiled. 
Section two: However, if her blood began to flow through some sort of unusual accident (Albeck mentions jumping or out of fright), then the second time she sees blood flow (assumedly not due to an accident) she doesn't retroactively defile things. In other words, since the first occurrence was "accidental" the second blood flow is treated as if it was the first.
