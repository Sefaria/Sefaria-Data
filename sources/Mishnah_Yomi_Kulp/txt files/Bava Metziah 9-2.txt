Mishnah Two
1) If one leased a field from his fellow and it was an irrigated field or a field with trees, and the spring dried up or the trees were cut down, he may not give [the owner] less than his agreed rental.  
2) But if he had said, “Lease me this irrigated field, or this field with trees”, and the spring dried up or the trees were cut down, he may give less than the prescribed rental.

Explanation—Mishnah Two
In the scenario in this mishnah a sharecropper receives a field from the owner, and the field contains either a spring (an irrigated field) or it has some trees in it.  Evidently the sharecropper will be growing grain in the field, but as an added bonus it has a spring, from which he can more easily water the field, or trees from which he may eat.  After he makes his agreement with the owner, the spring dries up or the trees are cut down (assumedly by someone either than owner or the sharecropper).  If the sharecropper had not explicitly stated that he was renting the field since it had on it a spring or some trees, he must still give the owner of the field the same amount of grain that was stated in the original agreement.  Although the sharecropper will have to work harder to water the field (if the field had a spring) or he will lose the added benefit of the trees (if it was a field with trees), since he did not specifically stipulate that he was renting the field on account of the spring or the trees, the agreement is not effected.  If, however, he specifically stipulated that he was renting a field with a spring or trees, he may reduce his payments if the spring dries up or the trees are cut down. 

Questions for Further Thought:
Mishnah two:  Why can we assume that neither the owner nor the sharecropper cut down the trees?
