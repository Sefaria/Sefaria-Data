Eduyoth, Chapter Three, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
1) Food which is in separate pieces does not combine together [to receive impurity], according to Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas. 
a) But the Sages say: “It does combines together.” 
2) One may exchange [ produce of] second tithe for uncoined metal, according to Rabbi Dosa. 
a) But the Sages say: “One may not so exchange it.” 
3) The hands [alone] need to be immersed for the waters of purification according to Rabbi Dosa. 
a) But the Sages say: “If his hands have become unclean his whole body becomes unclean.”

Explanation
Section one:  For food to become impure it must be the size of an egg.  According to Rabbi Dosa food which is broken up into pieces smaller than the size of an egg does not join to receive impurity, whereas according to the Sages it does.
Section two:  The second tithe may be redeemed with money and brought to Jerusalem.  According to Rabbi Dosa one may redeem this second tithe even with a coin that does not have a stamp upon it.  According to the Sages it must have a stamp.  This is learned from Deuteronomy 14:25, which says “money” in connection with second tithe.  
Section three:  A person whose hands have become impure by touching impure food (but not a corpse, which would cause impurity to the whole body), need only wash his hands before touching the waters of purification which are used to purify someone who has contracted corpse impurity.  This is according to Rabbi Dosa.  The Sages disagree and say that with regards to touching waters of purification, if his hands are impure his whole body is impure.  To become pure he would need to take a ritual bath (mikveh).
