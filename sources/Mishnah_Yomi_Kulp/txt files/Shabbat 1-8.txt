Shabbat, Chapter One, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This is the final debate between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel over work that is begun on Friday.

Mishnah Eight
Bet Shammai says: hides must not be given to a [non-Jewish] tanner, nor clothing to a non-Jewish launderer, unless they can be done while it is yet day; 
But in all these [cases] Bet Hillel, permits as long as the sun is still shining.  

Explanation
Like yesterday’s mishnah, this mishnah continues to deal with a Jew giving things to a gentile with which the gentile will work on the Sabbath.  In the case of today’s mishnah we might have thought that Bet Hillel would prohibit because it looks like the non-Jew will be doing work for the Jew on the Sabbath.  
The last part of the mishnah refers to all of the debates above.  In all of these cases, Bet Hillel permits the Jew to set the motion in process as long as the sun has not yet set.  The addition of “as long as the sun is still shining” also signals that this is the end of the series of debates.
