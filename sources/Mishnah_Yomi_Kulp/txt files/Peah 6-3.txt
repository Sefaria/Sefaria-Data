Peah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah continues to define when something is considered to be a forgotten sheaf.

Mishnah Three 
1) [With regard to sheaves forgotten] at the end of the row, the sheaf lying across from it proves [that the first sheaf has not been forgotten.]   
2) [As for] a sheaf that [the owner] took to bring it to the city and forgot it, all agree that it is not considered a “forgotten sheaf.”

Explanation
Section one:  This section deals with a sheaf that was forgotten at the beginning of a row. Tomorrow’s mishnah will define what exactly “the beginning of a row” means.  The mishnah teaches that if there is another sheaf lying in the row across from it, it proves that the sheaf has not been forgotten.  To illustrate this, let’s say that someone has ten rows of ten sheaves of wheat.  He begins to go from north to south to gather the sheaves to bundle them up and make a pile.  If he gets to the end of the row and leaves a sheaf there, it is not forgotten if the sheaf to its side is still there, because we can assume that his intention was to gather that sheaf when walking from east to west.  The only way that something can be considered forgotten at the end of a row is if he left it lying and there is no other sheaf to the east or west.
Section two:  A sheaf that has already begun to make its way to the city can no longer be considered forgotten.  In this case, and in the case in section one above, even Bet Hillel, who held in yesterday’s mishnah that a sheaf left near a fence or other identifiable place is considered forgotten, in the two cases in our mishnah Bet Hillel agrees that it is not considered forgotten because there is something that “proves” that he intended to leave it there.
