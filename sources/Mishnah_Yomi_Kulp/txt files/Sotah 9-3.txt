Sotah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Three

Introduction   
Our mishnah deals with a case where the head and body of the corpse were found in separate places.  There are two potential issues involved:  first of all, from where do they measure in order to determine which city must bring the heifer?  Secondly, where do they bury the body?  According to halakhah, an unidentified corpse is buried in the very place that it is found.  This is called a “met mitzvah”, a “commanded corpse”.  This corpse which is perhaps unidentified, is buried in its place.    

Mishnah Three
If the head was found in one place and the body in another place, they bring the head to the body, the words of Rabbi Eliezer.   
Rabbi Akiva says: [they bring] the body to the head.

Explanation
The debate in this mishnah is simple to understand but perhaps difficult to fully comprehend.  Rabbi Eliezer implies that the body is the important part, and therefore the head is brought to it, whereas Rabbi Akiva implies that the head is the important part, and therefore the body is brought to it.  
What seems certain to me is that there is a level to this debate deeper than the mere technical details.  In other words in this halakhah Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva are expressing deeper values.  What is uncertain is what those values are.  One suggestion which occurred to me is that Rabbi Eliezer is operating according to a principle of “quantity”.  Since the body is larger than the head, the head is brought to the body.  In contrast, Rabbi Akiva operates according to a principle of essentiality/quality.  The head is what governs the body.  The head governs the remainder.  Furthermore, it is what generally gives human beings their identity; people are recognized by their faces.  Therefore, the body is brought to their head.
