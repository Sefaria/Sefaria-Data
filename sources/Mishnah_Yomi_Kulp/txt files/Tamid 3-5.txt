Tamid, Chapter Three, Mishnah Five

Introduction
The mishnah now describes the bringing of the tamid to the slaughter house, and provides a description of the slaughter house.

Mishnah Five
1) The priest who had won the right to slaughter the tamid takes it along with him to the slaughter house, and those who had won the right to bring the limbs up followed after him. 
2) The slaughter house was to the north of the altar, and on it were eight small pillars on top of which were blocks of cedar wood, in which were fixed hooks of iron, three rows in each, upon which they would hang [the tamid] and they would strip its hide on tables of marble that stood between the pillars.

Explanation
Section one: The priest who won the right to slaughter and the priests who will bring the various parts of the sacrifice onto the ramp leading up to the altar all go to the slaughter house.
Section two: The mishnah describes the slaughterhouse, especially the hooks on which they would hang the meat after the tamid was slaughtered. It is also describes the tables upon which the meat would be washed. These processes will be described later in the mishnah.
