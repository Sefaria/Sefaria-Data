Mishnah Four
1) One who was clean for the hatat waters and then touched an oven: 
a) With his hand becomes unclean, 
b) With his foot he remains clean. 
2) If he stood on an oven and put out his hand beyond the oven with the flask in his hand, 
a) And so also in the case of a carrying-yoke which was placed over the oven and from which two jars were suspended one at either end:
i) Rabbi Akiva says that they remain clean; 
ii) But the sages say that they are unclean.  

Explanation
Section one: An oven is susceptible to midras impurity. However, it is not susceptible to corpse impurity and does not become a "father of impurity"which would cause it to defile people and vessels (see Kelim 8:6). Since the purity rules regarding an oven are different from other vessels, it does not have "madaf impurity" as do other vessels (see mishnah one). It is treated like food and liquids. If a person touches it with his hand, he is disqualified from performing the hatat ritual, but if with his foot, he is still qualified.
Section two: In both of these cases, the person is standing on the oven but the flasks that contain the hatat waters are not directly over the oven. Rabbi Akiva holds that since they are not over the oven, they remain pure. 
The other sages treat the flasks as if they were directly over the oven. This puts them in an "impure place" and as we have seen elsewhere, if the ashes are in an impure place, they are defiled, even if technically the defilement should not have reached them.
