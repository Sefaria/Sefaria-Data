2) If one leased a field from his fellow with the condition that he sow grain, he may not sow beans;

i) Rabban Gamaliel forbids this.

Explanation—Mishnah Eight
Both sections of this mishnah in essence teach the same law, so we will explain them together.  If one leased a field with the stipulation that he sow a certain type of produce he may not sow something else that is more damaging to the soil of that field.  He may, however, sow something that is less damaging to the soil.  For instance, if he promised to sow barley he may not sow wheat since wheat is more damaging; but if he promised to sow wheat he may sow barley, since barley is less damaging.  Similarly, if he promised to sow grain he may not sow beans which are more damaging; but if he promised to sow beans he may sow wheat which is less damaging.  This is the anonymous opinion expressed in the first two clauses of each section.  Rabban Gamaliel disagrees and states that one may not change the condition under any circumstance, even if the new seed will be less damaging to the field.  Although there may not be exist a specific reason why in certain cases one should not change the conditions of the agreement, one is in general forbidden to do so.

Questions for Further Thought:
 Mishnah eight:  What do you think Rabban Gamaliel would say if the renter asked the owner’s permission to change the type of seed?  Would he still forbid?
