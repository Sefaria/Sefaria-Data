Sheviit, Chapter Five, Mishnah Three

Introduction
During the sabbatical year any one can come and take the produce. Our mishnah deals with luf which has remained in the ground during the seventh year and is not picked until the eighth year.

Mishnah Three 
Luf which has remained [in the ground until] after the passing of the seventh year: 
1) Rabbi Eliezer says: if the poor had gathered its leaves, then they have gathered. If not, then an account must be made with the poor.   
2) Rabbi Joshua says: if the poor had gathered its leaves, then they have gathered. If not, the poor have no account with him (the field owner).

Explanation
Section one: Luf can remain in the ground for several years before it needs to be picked. Our mishnah talks about luf that could have been picked during the seventh year, but was left in the ground until the eighth year, thereby giving it time to grow. Rabbi Eliezer rules that if the poor people gathered it during the seventh year, then it is theirs and they need not compensate the field owner for the fact that he was planning on leaving the luf in the ground until the eighth year. If the poor people don’t gather the luf, then the field owner owes them for the benefit he gained by having the luf remain in the ground during the seventh year. In other words, the luf during the seventh year really belongs to the poor people and if they don’t collect it the field owner must compensate them, at least partially, for the fact that they did not do so. 
Section two: Rabbi Joshua agrees that the poor have the right to gather its leaves during the sabbatical year. However, if they don’t gather them, then they have no right to request from the field owner the amount that they had lost.
