Pesahim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah continues to teach the laws regarding the hagigah: what animals can be used for the hagigah and for how long it may be eaten.  

Mishnah Four
The hagigah was brought of flocks, herds, lambs or goats, of the males or the females. 
And it is eaten two days and one night.  

Explanation 
Section one:  Any animal, be it a sheep, goat, cow or bull will do for the hagigah. It can also be either male or female. This is contrasted with the pesah which must be a male flock animal (sheep or goat).  
Section two:  The hagigah may be eaten on the day it is sacrificed, the night afterwards and the whole following day.  This is the same rule as for all sacrifices of well-being (shelamim).  In contrast, the pesah sacrifice can only be eaten that very night, and it must be completed before midnight.
