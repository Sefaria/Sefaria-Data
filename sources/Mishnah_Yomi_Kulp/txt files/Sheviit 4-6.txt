Sheviit, Chapter Four, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with the subject of keeping trees healthy on Sheviit.

Mishnah Six
1) One who trims grape vines, or cuts reeds: 
a) Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: he must leave [uncut at least] one handbreadth.   
b) But Rabbi Akiba says: he may cut them in the usual manner, with the axe, sickle or saw, or with whatever he pleases. 
2) A tree that had split may be tied up in the seventh year, not that it may heal, but only that it should not widen.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Rabbi Yose the Galilean when one trims grape vines or cuts down reeds in a marshy area, he must leave a handbreadth from where he trims or cuts to make sure that it doesn’t look like he is either pruning the grape vine or preparing the land for planting. Pruning is prohibited because it is done to improve the vine and preparing the land for planting is similarly prohibited. When he leaves the handbreadth it is clear that he is only cutting down in order to get the stuff out of the way.
Rabbi Akiba is not concerned with this and allows him to trim the grape vines and cut the reeds in a normal manner.
Section two: If a tree somehow split during the sabbatical year, it is permitted to tie it back together.  However, the intent should not be so that the tree will heal because this would be improving the tree. Rather, the intent must be just to prevent worse damage from occurring.  Again, improving is prohibited whereas maintaining is permitted.
