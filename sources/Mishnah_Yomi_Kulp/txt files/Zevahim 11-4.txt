Zevahim, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
1) Whether a garment, a sack, or a hide, it requires washing in a holy place.
2) The breaking of an earthen vessel must be in a holy place.
3) And the scouring and rinsing of a copper vessel must be in a holy place.   
4) In this the hatat is more stringent than [other] sacrifices of higher sanctity.

Explanation
Section one: No matter the material of the garment, whether it be normal cloth, probably made of wool or linen, or coarse sack-cloth or a hide, it must be washed in the holy place, which means in the Temple courtyard. This is stated explicitly in Leviticus 6:20. 
Section two: Leviticus 6:21 states, “An earthen vessel in which it [the hatat] was boiled shall be broken.” The mishnah teaches that just as the washing of the garment must be in the Temple courtyard, so too the breaking of the copper vessel must be done there. In both cases the hatat contaminates, and therefore the contamination must be cleansed.
Section three: The continuation of the verse states, “If it was boiled in a copper vessel, [the vessel] shall be scoured and rinsed with water.” This too must be done in the Temple courtyard.
Section four: In this regard, the laws concerning the hatat are more stringent than the laws concerning other sacrifices, even most holy ones. In cases involving other sacrifices, the garment can be washed, the earthen vessel can be broken and the copper vessel can be rinsed and scoured in places other than the Temple courtyard.
