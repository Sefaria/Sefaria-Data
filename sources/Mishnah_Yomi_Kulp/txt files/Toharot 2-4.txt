Toharot, Chapter Tow, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Today's mishnah is the same pattern as yesterday's mishnah, except it deals with terumah. As we shall see, the rules governing terumah are one degree stricter than those governing common food.

Mishnah Four
1) First [degree] and second [degree uncleanness] in terumah are unclean and convey uncleanness;   
2) Third [degree uncleanness] causes invalidity but does not convey uncleanness.
3) And fourth [degree uncleanness] may be eaten in a dish containing holy food.

Explanation
Section one: When it comes to terumah, even something with second degree uncleanness can defile other terumah.
Section two: Terumah with third degree impurity is invalid but it does not convey uncleanness to other terumah with which it comes into contact.
Section three: Basically, there is no such thing as fourth degree uncleanness when it comes to terumah. Something that has been in contact with third degree uncleanness can be eaten in a dish with holy food.
