Ohalot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
The mishnah now explores other possible spatial relationships between the house and the hive. Today's mishnah discusses what happens if the hive is entirely within the house. 

Mishnah Nine
1) [In the case when the hive] was entirely within the house and there is not a space of a handbreadth between it and the roof beams, if there is uncleanness within [the hive], the house becomes unclean.
2) But if there is uncleanness in the house, what is within [the hive] remains clean, for the manner of the uncleanness is to go out and not to go in.   
3) [Whether [the hive] is standing upright, or lying on its side, whether there is one [hive] or two.    

Explanation
Section one: The hive is fully inside the house and its opening is less than one handbreadth's from the ceiling. If there is uncleanness is in the hive, then it will leave the hive and go out and defile the contents of the house.
Section two: However, the uncleanness will not enter the smaller space of the hive if it is found in the house. This accords with the principle we learned in mishnah 4:1, that impurity goes out to the outer space, but does not travel in to the inner space.
Section three: The same is true if the hive is lying on its side, with its mouth up against the wall. It is similarly true if there are two hives, one on top of the other and there is less than a handbreadth between the two hives, and less than a handbreadth between the top hive and the ceiling.
