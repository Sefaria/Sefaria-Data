Bava Kamma Chapter Eight Mishna Five

Mishnah Five
1) If a man struck his father or mother and left a wound, or if he wounded his fellow on the Sabbath, he is not liable for any of the [five] counts because he is liable for his life.
2) If a man wounded his Canaanite (non-Jewish) slave he is not liable on any of the five counts.

Explanation
Striking one’s father or mother and causing a wound or wounding another person on the Sabbath are all capital crimes.  Since the person is sentenced to death, he is not obligated for the death penalty.  (For more on this clause see the explanation to Mishnah three).
A non-Jewish slave is considered the property of his owner and cannot own any money.  Therefore one who injures his own non-Jewish slave does not make any payment, since he would pay the money to himself in any case.
Note that this is not a license to injure non-Jewish slaves.  According to Exodus 21:26-27 if a man should strike his slave and cause him to lose his eye or tooth the slave must be set free. The Rabbis expanded this law to include losses of other body parts.
