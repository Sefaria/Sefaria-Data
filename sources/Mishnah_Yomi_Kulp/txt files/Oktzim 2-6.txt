Mishnah Six
1) [The shell of] a roasted egg [is considered connected] until it is cracked.
a) That of a hard-boiled egg [is considered connected] until it is entirely broken up. 
2) A marrow-bone serves as connected until it is wholly crushed.
3) A pomegranate that has been divided into sections is connected until it has been knocked with a stick. 
4) Similarly, loose stitches of laundrymen or a garment that had been stitched together with threads of kilayim, are connected until one begins to loosen them.  

Explanation
Section one: The shell of a roasted, soft-boiled egg is considered connected to the egg until the egg is cracked so that someone could scoop out or suck out the egg itself.
If the egg was hard-boiled, then the shell is connected until it's all broken up. At this point it no longer guards the eggs. But it is already not considered connected even though it hasn't been removed.
Section two: Until he crushes the bone to get out the marrow, the whole bone is considered connected.
Section three: It seems that they would remove the seeds of the pomegranate by hitting it with a stick. This is a trick that I would like to learn. In any case, until he knocks on the pomegranate to separate the seeds, it is considered connected.
Section four: If a laundrymen or clothier sold strung garments together with string that are "kilayim" with each other—meaning the garment is wool and the string is linen or vice versa then they are connected and therefore forbidden from use until he begins to loosen them.
