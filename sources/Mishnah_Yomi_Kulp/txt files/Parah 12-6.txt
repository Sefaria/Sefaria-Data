Parah, Chapter Twelve, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
1) One who sprinkles with unclean hyssop: if [the hyssop] was the amount of an egg the water becomes invalid, and the sprinkling is invalid.
a) If it was less than the amount of an egg, the water remains valid but the sprinkling is invalid. 
2) It also defiles other hyssop, and that other hyssop to other, even if they be a hundred.

Explanation
Section one: The hyssop needs to be the volume of an egg in order to convey impurity (see 11:3). If one dips the unclean hyssop into the water it defiles the remaining water and the sprinkling is invalid.
However, if there is less than an egg in volume, the water remains valid because less than an egg is insufficient to convey impurity. However, the sprinkling is still invalid because the hyssop was not pure.
Section two: If there is an egg's worth of hyssop it defiles other hyssop by contact such that the other hyssop also cannot be used for the hatat ritual. Similarly, the newly defiled hyssop will defile any hyssop with which it has contact and it too will not be valid for the hatat ritual. The reason is that when it comes to the hatat ritual, there is no such thing as "first degree impurity" "second degree impurity" etc, as there is with other matters of purity. Rather, the level of impurity is never reduced.
