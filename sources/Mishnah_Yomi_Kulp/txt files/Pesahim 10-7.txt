Pesahim, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Seven

Introduction 
This mishnah discusses the third and fourth cups of wine and the conclusion of the meal.

Mishnah Seven
1) They poured him a third cup, blesses over his meal. 
2) A fourth [cup], he concludes the Hallel, and recites over it the blessing of song.   
3) Between these cups if he wants he may drink; between the third and the fourth he may not drink.

Explanation
Section one:  The Grace after the Meal, or Birkat Hamazon, is recited over a third cup of wine. We should note that according to the Mishnah and Talmud Birkat Hamazon is normally recited over a cup of wine, meaning that one holds a cup of wine while reciting the Birkat Hamazon, then recites a blessing over drinking wine (borei peri hagefen) and then drinks the cup at the end.  Some people still have this custom today, at least on Shabbat and festivals.  
Section two:  The fourth cup is recited over the recitation of the Hallel.  In the Talmud there is a debate over what the “blessing of the song” is.  Some say it is “Nishmat Kol Hai”, a prayer recited during the morning prayers of Shabbat and festivals.  Others say it is “Yehallukhah Adonai Elohenu”, which is a prayer recited at the end of Hallel on other occasions.  Today we recite both.
Section three:  Between the second and third cups it is permitted to drink more wine.  This is the time when the meal is consumed and it was allowed to drink extra cups during the meal itself.  However, it is forbidden to drink between the third and fourth cups lest he gets drunk and is not able to complete the seder.  The rabbis thought that drinking alcohol while eating would not cause one to get drunk.
