Nazir, Chapter Two, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
The final mishnah of chapter two continues to deal with nazirite vows made on the condition that the one vowing will have a son.

Mishnah Ten
[If one says] “Behold, I am a nazirite when I shall have a son, and I will be a nazirite for one hundred days [on my own account],”:  if a son was born to him before the expiration of seventy days, he loses none of this period;  but if after seventy days, it voids [anything over the] seventy days, since there can be no shaving for a period of less than thirty days. 

Explanation
A person vows to serve a regular naziriteship of thirty days if he has a son, and he also vows to be a nazirite for 100 days.  This situation is similar to that described at the end of yesterday’s mishnah. He begins to serve his own naziriteship immediately, as we learned yesterday.  If his son is born before he serves seventy days of his own naziriteship, then he will lose nothing of the days that he has already served.  What he will do in this case is serve a thirty day naziriteship for his son, and then go back and serve the remaining days of his own naziriteship.  However, if his son is born after he has served seventy days, he will lose credit for some of the days which he has served towards his own 100 day naziriteship.  In this case he will serve the thirty days for his son’s naziriteship and then complete his naziriteship with another thirty days.  If he had previously served eighty days, he will serve a term of 110 days for his own naziriteship, thereby serving an extra ten days.  This is because a term of naziriteship can never be less than thirty days.  
According to the Rambam, this mishnah clarifies the end of yesterday’s mishnah.  There, when we learned that he goes back and counts his own naziriteship, the intention was that he must in all cases count at least thirty days.
