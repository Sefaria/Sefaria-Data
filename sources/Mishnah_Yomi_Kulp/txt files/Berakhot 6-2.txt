Berakhot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Two

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with blessings that are valid in a default sense—that is to say they are not the preferable blessing to be recited over various food items, but nevertheless if one recites them one has fulfilled his obligation to recite a blessing.

Mishnah Two
1) If one blessed over fruit of the tree the blessing, “Who creates the fruit of the ground,” he has fulfilled his obligation. 
a) But if he said over produce from the ground, “Who creates the fruit of the tree,” he has not fulfilled his obligation. 
2) If over anything he says “By Whose word all things exist”, he has fulfilled his obligation.

Explanation
Section one:  Trees grow from the ground (didn’t need me to tell you that, did you).  Therefore, if one recites “Bore pri ha’adamah” over a fruit that grows from the tree, the obligation to recite the blessing has been fulfilled.  
This does not work in the opposite way. Things can grow from the ground without being from trees (I suppose you knew that as well). Therefore, if one recites “Bore pri haetz” over something that grows from the ground but not from a tree, say a cucumber, one has not fulfilled one’s obligation and he must go back and recite the correct blessing.
Section two:  There is a default blessing that works for all foods—“shehakol niheye bedvaro.”  In this generalized blessing, we acknowledge God as the source of everything in the world through the words God used at the moment of creation.  As we shall see in the following mishnah, this is also the blessing which we recite over foods that don’t grow from the ground.
