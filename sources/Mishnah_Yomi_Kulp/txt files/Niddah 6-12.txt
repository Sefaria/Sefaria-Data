Niddah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Twelve

Introduction
Today's mishnah clarifies how long a hair must be for it to count as a hair. 

Mishnah Twelve
1) The two hairs spoken of in regard to the red heifer and in regard to leprosy as well as those spoken of anywhere else must be long enough for their tips to be bent to their roots, the words of Rabbi Ishmael. 
2) Rabbi Eliezer says: long enough to be grasped by a finger-nail.
3) Rabbi Akiva says: long enough to be taken off with scissors. 

Explanation
Section one: Besides the context of our chapter—hairs that are a sign of human puberty—there are several other "halakhic hairs." The first is that black or white hairs can disqualify a red heifer from being used in the purification ritual (see Parah 2:5). The second is that two hairs are a sign of impurity in a leprous spot (see Negaim 4:4, 10:2-3). The issue of hair also comes up in the commandment that a nazirite shave all of his hairs at the end of his naziriteship, and that a metzora (a person with skin disease) shave when becoming pure. If either of them leaves two hairs, the shaving doesn't count. 
In all of these cases, Rabbi Ishmael holds that the hair must be long enough that one could take the tip and bend it back to the root.
Rabbi Eliezer says that it need only be possible to grasp the nail with one's finger nail. Rabbi Akiva says that it must be long enough that one could cut it with scissors. According to commentators, this is the smallest measure.
