Bava Metziah Chapter Four Mishna Five 

Introduction
Mishnah five deals with the amount that may be missing in the weight of a coin before the use of the coin constitutes fraud.
Mishnah six deals with how long a seller has to return a coin to the purchaser if the coin is missing weight.

Mishnah Five
1) How much may be missing from a sela and still not fall within the rule of fraud?
a) Rabbi Meir says:  “Four issars, one issar per dinar.”
b) Rabbi Judah says:  “Four pondions, one pondion per dinar.”
c) Rabbi Shimon says:  “Eight pondions, two pondions per dinar.”

Explanation
In order to understand this mishnah we need to understand the coinage mentioned in it.  One sela = four dinars = 48 pondions = 96 issars
Rabbi Meir holds that if the weight of a sela is missing the weight of four issars then its use is considered to be fraud.  This is a ratio of 1/24.  Rabbi Judah holds that a ratio of 1/12 constitutes fraud and Rabbi Shimon that a ratio of 1/6 constitutes fraud, which is the same as regular fraud as we learned in the previous mishnayoth.

Questions for Further Thought:
 Mishnah five:  If the normal ratio of fraud is 1/6 why would Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Judah hold a stricter standard with regards to the weight of coins?
