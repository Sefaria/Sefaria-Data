Explanation
Section one: Today's mishnah deals with negaim that are found on the head or beard. This topic is dealt with directly in Leviticus 13:29. Such negaim are identified by a thin yellow hair (Leviticus 13:30) or by spreading.
Section two: The yellow thin hair can serve as an identifying mark at the beginning of the examination period, or at the end of any of the weeks of isolation.
Section three: The spreading must occur at the end of at least one of the weeks.
Section four: Same as mishnah three.
