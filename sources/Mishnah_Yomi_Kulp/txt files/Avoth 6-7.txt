Avoth, Chapter Six, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah is basically a series of prooftexts taken from Proverbs, and used to prove the life-giving qualities of Torah.  The book of Proverbs was an especially rich source for quotes in rabbinic literature.  Note that there are seven prooftexts, a number that is surely not accidental.

Mishnah Seven
Great is Torah for it gives life to those that practice it, in this world, and in the world to come, 
1) As it is said:  “For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh” (Proverbs 4:22), 
2) And it says:  “It will be a cure for your navel and marrow for your bones” (ibid. 3:8) 
3) And it says: “She is a tree of life to those that grasp her, and whoever holds onto her is happy” (ibid. 3:18), 
4) And it says:  “For they are a graceful wreath upon your head, a necklace about your throat” (ibid. 1:9), 
5) And it says:  “She will adorn your head with a graceful wreath; crown you with a glorious diadem” (ibid. 4:9) 
6) And it says:  “In her right hand is length of days, in her left riches and honor” (ibid. 3:16), 
7) And it says:  “For they will bestow on you length of days, years of life and peace” (ibid. 3:2).   

Explanation
This mishnah is a series of quotes from Proverbs, each of which proves that Torah is beneficial, that it bestows life and wealth.  I will only comment on a few of these texts.
Section three:  The Torah is a tree of life, but only for those who “grasp her”.  This means that the words of Torah require reinforcement, that is continuous study.  
Section four:  According to the commentators, the head mentioned in this verse refers to thought and the throat refers to speech.  Torah learning is only acquired by engaging both one’s head and one’s throat.  
Section seven:  Just as the Amidah prayer concludes with a request for peace, so too does this mishnah.
