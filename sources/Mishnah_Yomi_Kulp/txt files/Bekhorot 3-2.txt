Bekhorot, Chapter Three, Mishnah Two

Introduction
In this mishnah Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel teaches that when one sees an animal nursing, he can assume that it is nursing its own offspring. As we shall see, this has certain halakhic ramifications for determining which animal is a first born.

Mishnah Two 
1) Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel says: if one buys a nursing animal from a non-Jew, he need not fear that perhaps the offspring belongs to another [animal].   
2) If he went among his herd and saw animals which had given birth for the first time nursing and animals which had not given birth for the first time nursing, we need not fear that perhaps the offspring of this one came to the other or perhaps the offspring of the other came to this one. 

Explanation
Section one: If one buys a nursing animal from a non-Jew, one can assume that it is nursing its own animal and therefore, one does not have to treat the next born animal as a first born. 
Section two: Similarly, if one sees animals in his own herd nursing, he can assume that they are nursing their own offspring. For instance, if he sees an animal that he knows has already given birth nursing a female and an animal that has not given birth is nursing a male, he can be sure that the male is a first born. If the offspring of the one that has given birth is a male, he can be sure that it is not a first born.
