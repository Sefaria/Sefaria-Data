Mishnah Six
1) If one leased a field from his fellow and the locusts devoured the crop or it was blasted [by strong winds which caused the grain to be prematurely separated from the stalks], if it was a region-wide mishap he may reduce the amount of the rental agreement.
a) If it was not a region-wide mishap, he may not reduce the amount of the rental agreement.
b) Rabbi Judah says: “If he had leased it from him for a fixed amount of money, in neither case may he reduce the amount of the rental agreement.”

Explanation—Mishnah Six
In the scenario in our mishnah, the sharecropper’s crops are destroyed by either locusts or strong winds.  If the sharecropper had promised to give the owner a percentage of the crops, then he may continue to do so, even if it turns out that the owner received nothing.  This scenario is not even discussed in our mishnah.  If, however, he promised the owner a fixed amount in return, in either crops or money, he will have a problem, since he did not grow enough crops to pay back the owner.  This is the scenario discussed in the mishnah.  According to the mishnah, if the locusts or the strong winds effected the entire region he may reduce the amount paid back.  If, however, the locusts or strong winds effected only his field, he must still pay the owner back the full amount.
According to Rabbi Judah, if the amount owed to the owner was fixed in money and not in crops, then the sharecropper must pay his full share in any case, even if the crops were destroyed by a region-wide plague.  Since the money is considered to be separate from the field, it is unaffected by what happens to the field.  

Questions for Further Thought:
 Mishnah six:  Why is the sharecropper allowed to reduce the payments to the owner only if it was a region wide problem that ruined his crops?  What might the mishnah be suspicious of if the locusts or winds ruined only his crops?
