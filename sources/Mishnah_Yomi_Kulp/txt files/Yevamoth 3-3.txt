Yevamoth, Chapter Three, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This is the final mishnah which deals with the subject raised in mishnah one.  

Mishnah Two
I) If one of the sisters was forbidden to one brother under the prohibition of incest and the other sister was forbidden to the other under the prohibition of incest, she who is forbidden to the one is permitted to the other and she who is forbidden to the other is permitted to the first. 
II) This is what they said: when her sister is her sister-in-law she may either perform halizah or be taken in yibbum.

Explanation
Section one:  If each sister is prohibited to one brother due to an incest prohibition, for instance Levi is married to Rachel’s daughter and Judah is married to Leah’s daughter, Levi may have yibbum with Leah and Judah may have yibbum with Rachel.  This is because each sister is a z’kukah to only one brother.  Rachel is a z’kukah only to Judah and Leah only to Levi.  When yibbum is performed neither brother is having relations with the sister of his z’kukah.
Section two:  This refers to the end of mishnah 2:3.  Rachel and Leah are both sisters and were sisters-in-law before Reuven and Shimon died.  The only time that both Rachel and Leah could have yibbum with a brother is when both are forbidden to one brother through a prohibition of incest, as our mishnah describes. 
Note that our mishnah is actually quoting an earlier mishnah and explaining it.  This phenomenon of mishnah explaining an older mishnah does occasionally occur in the Mishnah.
