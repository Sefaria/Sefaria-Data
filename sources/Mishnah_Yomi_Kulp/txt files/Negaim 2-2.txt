Negaim, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
1) Negaim may not be inspected in the early morning or in the evening, nor in a house, nor on a cloudy day, because then the dull white appears like bright white; nor may they be inspected at noon, because then the bright white appears like dull white. 
2) When are they to be inspected? During the third, fourth, fifth, eighth or ninth hour, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
a) Rabbi Judah ruled: during the fourth, fifth, eighth or ninth hour.  

Explanation
Section one: If the nega is inspected in weak light or in too strong light it will be difficult to assess its true color.
Section two: Therefore it must be inspected in either the early part of the day or the later part of the day, but not at dawn or dusk. 
The day was divided into twelve hours. Roughly speaking, Rabbi Meir would say that the nega must be examined during the third, fourth and fifth hours of the day, and then later, from the eighth and ninth hours. Rabbi Judah says three is too early.
