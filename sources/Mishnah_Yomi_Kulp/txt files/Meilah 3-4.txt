Mishnah Four
1) The ashes of the inner altar and [of the wicks of] the menorah may not be used but they are not subject to the law of sacrilege. 
2) If one dedicates ashes they are subject to the law of sacrilege. 
3) Turtle-doves which have not reached the right age and pigeons which have exceeded the right age may not be used but they are not subject to the law of sacrilege.
4) Rabbi Shimon said: turtle-doves which have not yet reached the right age are subject to the law of sacrilege, while pigeons which have exceeded the right age are not allowed for use, but are exempt from the law of sacrilege.

Explanation
Section one: The incense was burned on the inner altar, inside the Sanctuary. It is forbidden to use the ashes from this altar, and to use the wicks of the menorah. However, since their mitzvoth had already been performed, they are not subject to the law of sacrilege, as we learned in yesterday’s mishnah.
Section two: If after the ashes were removed from the Temple, someone picked them up and dedicated them to the Temple, they would then become subject to sacrilege. In other words, they would remain forbidden but one who did use them would be liable to compensate the Temple.
Section three: Turtle-doves can be used as sacrifices when they are mature. Pigeons can only be used when they are young. If one dedicates them before they have reached the right age, or after they have passed their age they may not be used, but they are not subject to the law of sacrilege, because they are not fit to be put on the altar. 
Section four: Before turtle-doves reach the right age, they are subject to the law of sacrilege, because they will eventually become fit for the altar. However, he agrees with the previous opinion that once pigeons have passed the age at which they can be sacrificed, they are no longer subject to sacrilege.
