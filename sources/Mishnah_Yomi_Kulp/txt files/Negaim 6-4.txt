Negaim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
If a bright spot was larger in size than a split bean and in it there was quick flesh larger than a lentil, irrespective of whether they increased or decreased, they are unclean, provided that they do not decrease to less than the prescribed minimum. 

Explanation
This case is quite straightforward—both the nega and the quick flesh are larger than the required size for them to be impure. Therefore, they are immediately impure and it doesn't matter whether they increase or decrease. They will only become pure if they decrease to smaller than the prescribed size.
