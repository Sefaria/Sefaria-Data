Bava Metziah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Nine 

Introduction
Mishnah nine states some legal differences with regards to the rights of a sharecropper who receives a field for less than seven years versus one who receives the field for more than seven years.
Mishnah ten deals with the issue of including the sabbatical year in the rental agreement.

Mishnah Nine
1) If one leased a field from his fellow for but a few years he may not sow flax and he has no right to cut beams from the sycamore tree.
a) If he leased it for seven years he may sow flax the first year and he has a right to cut beams from the sycamore tree.

Explanation
When one rents a field he is expected to return the field and everything in it to its owner in a state similar to that that in which he received it.  If he were to sow the field with flax which damages the soil and then return the field, the field would still bear the damage of the flax.  Therefore, if he wishes to plant flax he must plant it at least seven years before the end of the rental agreement.  If he rents the field, therefore, for seven years, he may plant flax during the first year.  Similarly, he must return the trees that were on the field in the same condition in which he received them.  If he were to cut down the thick branches of the sycamore, they would take a long time to grow back.  Therefore, he may only cut down these types of branches if there are seven years left before the end of the rental agreement.
