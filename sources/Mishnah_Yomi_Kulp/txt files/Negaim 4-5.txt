Negaim, Chapter Four, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
1) If a bright spot was of the size of a split bean and a string extended from it, if it was two hairs in breadth, it is subject to the restrictions in respect of white hair and spreading, but not to that in respect of its quick flesh.   
2) If there were two bright spots and a streak extended from one to the other, if it was two hairs in breadth, it combines them; but if not, it does not combine them.

Explanation
Section one: The mishnah discusses a nega (a bright spot or baheret in Hebrew) from which a line of some sort extends. If this line is thick enough, then the line is considered part of the nega in that if a white hair comes out of the line or if the line spreads, it is a sign of impurity. However, if quick flesh appears in the line it is not a sign of impurity unless the quick flesh itself is the size of a split bean. 
Section two: A line (a streak) between two negaim serves to join them if it is wide enough. In such a case they are treated as one nega, and if a white hair or spreading appears in one, both are judged to be impure.
