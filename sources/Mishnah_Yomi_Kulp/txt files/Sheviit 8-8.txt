Sheviit, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Our mishnah contains a list of things that one may not purchase or do with sheviit money (money used to buy sheviit produce). It also explains what one must do if one did buy such things with sheviit money.

Mishnah Eight
1) One might not buy slaves, land, or an unclean beast with sheviit money.  
2) If he did buy he must [buy and] eat [food] for their equivalent.   
3) One may not bring the bird-offerings of a zav or a zavah, or of a woman after childbirth with sheviit money.
4) If he did bring he must [buy and] eat [food] for their equivalent. 
5) One may not anoint vessels with oil of seventh year produce.
6) If he did annoint he must [buy and] eat [food] for their equivalent.

Explanation 
Section one: Since these are not food items, it is forbidden to buy them with money that one received from the proceeds of selling sheviit produce.
Section two: There is however a remedy for having done so. One should buy an amount of produce equivalent to the amount one paid for the land, slaves or unclean beast. Then one must eat this food as if it had the sanctity of sheviit. 
Section three: A zav or a zavah is a man or woman who has had an abnormal genital discharge. After a period of uncleanness the person must bring two birds as sacrifices (Leviticus 15:14, 29). The same sacrifices are brought by a woman after she gives birth (Lev. 12:8). One cannot purchase these sacrifices with sheviit money. Albeck explains that one cannot bring any sacrifices with sheviit money. It is not entirely clear why, then, the mishnah mentions these sacrifices. 
Section four: same as section two.
Section five: Sheviit oil may be used to anoint one’s body, but not one’s vessels. 
Section six:  same as section two.
