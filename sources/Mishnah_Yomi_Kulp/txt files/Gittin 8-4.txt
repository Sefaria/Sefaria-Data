Gittin, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Four

Introduction
In this mishnah Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel disagree over whether or not a get is valid if after its being written but before its being given the husband was secluded with his wife.

Mishnah Four
Bet Shammai says:  a man may divorce his wife with an old get, 
But Bet Hillel forbids this. 
What is meant by an old get? 
One where he was secluded with her after he wrote it.

Explanation
Bet Hillel forbids a man to use an “old get” to divorce his wife.  Bet Hillel is concerned lest while secluded the couple has sexual relations, she becomes pregnant and people think that the child was conceived after she was divorced, assuming that the divorce occurred only on the date written on the get.  For instance, let’s say he had the get written in November, continued to live with her and she became pregnant in February, and he gave her the document in March before they knew that she was pregnant.  People will think that he divorced her in November, the date written on the get, and that the kid was conceived after she was divorced.  Therefore, Bet Hillel prohibits the use of an “old get.”  
Bet Shammai does not assume that just because they were secluded, they had sex.  Therefore, he allows the husband to use the get so long as they were only secluded but did not actually have sex.  We shall see at the end of the tractate, that Bet Shammai rules that a husband may divorce his wife only on the grounds of adultery. Since divorce is possible only under such circumstances, it is unlikely, and indeed forbidden, for the couple to have relations after he writes out a get.
