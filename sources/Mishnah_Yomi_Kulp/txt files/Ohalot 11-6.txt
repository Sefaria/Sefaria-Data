Ohalot, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Today's mishnah is the final one in the series of debates between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel concerning a person acting as an ohel. 

Mishnah Six
[In the case] where the uncleanness was in the house and clean persons overshadowed him:
Bet Shammai declares them clean, 
But Bet Hillel declares them unclean.

Explanation
As was the case in yesterday's mishnah, the person is again lying on the threshold. In this case, the impurity is in the house and then clean people overshadow him. Since Bet Shammai thinks that the person does not form an ohel to bring the impurity out of the house; they remain clean. Bet Hillel again holds that the person is hollow and that he brings the impurity out of the house, thereby defiling those who overshadow him.
