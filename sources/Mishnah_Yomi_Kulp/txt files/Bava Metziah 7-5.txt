Mishnah Five
1) A laborer may eat cucumbers even to a denar’s worth, and dates even to a denar’s worth.
a) Rabbi Elazar ben Hisma says:  “A laborer may not eat more than the value of his wages.
b) But the Sages permit it, but they teach a man not to be gluttonous as to close the door against himself.

Explanation—Mishnah Five
According to the anonymous opinion in section one of the mishnah, a laborer may eat as much food as he wants.  Rabbi Elazar ben Hisma disagrees and states that by law a laborer may not eat more than he earns.  The Sages, who are the same Rabbis who held the opinion in the first clause, permit a laborer to eat more than he earns.  However, they state that for the laborer’s own good we teach him not to eat too much for if he does he will not be rehired.  In other words while it may be legal for him to eat gluttonously, it will damage his reputation and in the future prevent him from being able to earn an income.
