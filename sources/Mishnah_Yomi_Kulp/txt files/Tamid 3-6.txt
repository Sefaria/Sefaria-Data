Tamid, Chapter Three, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
1) Those who had won the right to clear the ashes from the inner altar and from the candlestick would go first with four vessels in their hands — the teni, the kuz and two keys. 
2) The teni resembled a large tarkav of gold and held two and a half kavs. 
a) The kuz resembled a large gold pitcher. 
3) And two keys: 
a) One of the two keys would reach down to the “amah of the armpit” and the other opens immediately. 

Explanation
Section one: Before the people described in yesterday’s mishnah would go to bring the animal to the slaughterhouse, the priests who had won the right to clear the ashes would first go in to do their work. The mishnah describes the four objects that they would carry with them. [This mishnah does seem to be out of order. Indeed, in the Talmud it comes before the previous mishnah]. 
Section two: The first two objects were used to carry out the ashes. One was called the teni, and it was the size of a basket that could hold two and a half kavs (about five liters). The kuz resembled a gold pitcher. The mishnah does not state how large the kuz was.
Section three: They also held two keys to open the two locks on the first door. With one key they would open a lock below called the “amah of the armpit.” There are two reasons given for why it has this name. First of all, the priest unlocking the lock might have had to bend down a cubit (an amah) until he opened it. Alternatively, he had to stick his hand into the door until it was up until his armpit. Once the bottom lock was opened, he could open the top lock with the other key immediately.
