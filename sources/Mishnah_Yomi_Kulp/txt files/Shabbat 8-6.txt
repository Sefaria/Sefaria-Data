Shabbat, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Six

Introduction
This mishnah deals with harder materials:  bone, glass, pebbles and stones.

Mishnah Six
1) Bone, is as much as is required for making a spoon.   
a) Rabbi Judah says: enough for making a tooth [of a key] with it; 
2) Glass, enough for scraping the end of a shuttle.
3) A pebble or a stone, large enough to throw at a bird; 
a) Rabbi Elazar ben Yaakov says: large enough to throw at an animal.

Explanation
Section one:  According to the first opinion, the minimum amount of bone for which one is liable for carrying must be enough to make a large spoon.  Rabbi Judah sets a smaller amount—enough to make part of a key which was typically made from bone. 
Section two:  A small piece of glass would be used to scrape the end of the spinning shuttle (used in weaving).  Therefore, one who carries a piece of glass large enough for this purpose is liable.
Section three:  Pebbles and stones were used to kill birds and small animals (although for Jews these animals would not be edible.)  According to the first opinion the pebble or stone need only be large enough to throw at a bird, whereas Rabbi Elazar ben Yaakov holds that it needs to be large enough to throw at an animal.
