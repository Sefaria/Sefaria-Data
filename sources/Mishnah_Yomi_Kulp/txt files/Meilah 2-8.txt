Meilah, Chapter One, Mishnah Eight

Our mishnah discusses how the law of sacrilege relates to menahot.

Mishnah Eight
1) The law of sacrilege applies to menahot (grain offerings) from the moment of their dedication. 
2) Once they have become sacred by being put in the vessel [of service] they become susceptible for unfitness through contact with a tevul yom or one who still requires atonement, or by remaining overnight. 
3) Once the handful has been offered they are subject to [the law of] piggul, notar and defilement, and the law of sacrilege no longer applies to the remnants, but it applies to the handful until its ashes have been removed to the place of the ashes. 

Explanation
Section one: See every other mishnah in this chapter.
Section two: Once the minhah is placed in a vessel it can be disqualified. The rest of the categories are the same as those in every other mishnah in this chapter.
Section three: Once the handful has been removed and placed on the altar, the minhah can be eaten by the priests, and therefore the law of sacrilege no longer applies. However, one who eats it in a disqualified state is now liable for the three prohibitions mentioned in all of the mishnayot above.
