Taanit, Chapter One, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah continues with the next series of fasts.

Mishnah Five
If Rosh Hodesh Kislev came and no rain fell the court ordains upon the community three fasts; they may eat and drink while it is still dark and it is permissible to do work, to bathe, to anoint oneself with oil, to wear shoes, and to have marital relations.

Explanation
The only difference between these fasts and the previous three is that these are observed by the entire community.  Other than that, everything is still the same.  They eat and drink the night before, and only eating and drinking is prohibited.
