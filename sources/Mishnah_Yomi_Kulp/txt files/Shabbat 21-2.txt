Shabbat, Chapter Twenty-One, Mishnah Two

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with retrieving things that have on them something that is muktzeh.

Mishnah Two
1) If a stone is on the mouth of a cask [of wine], one tilts it to its side and it falls off.  
2) If it [the cask] is [standing] among [other] casks, he lifts it up, tilts it on its side, and it falls off. 
3) If money is lying on a cushion, one shakes the cushion, and it falls off. 
4) If snot is on it, one wipes it off with a rag;  
5) If it is on leather, one pours water over it until it disappears.

Explanation
Section one:  She can’t just pick up the stone because it is muktzeh.  However, she can tilt the cask of wine and thereby cause the stone to fall off.
Section two:  In this case she is afraid that if she tilts the cask the stone may fall off and break the other cask.  Alternatively, there may not be room to tilt the cask to the side.  In such a case she can pick the cask up and then let the stone fall off.
Section three:  Money is muktzeh since it cannot be used on Shabbat.  As an aside, the reason that it can’t be used on Shabbat is lest one write a receipt or an account of the money spent.  To move the money one merely tilts the cushion and the money falls off.  Again, we see that if something which is “muktzeh” rests on something that is not muktzeh, the bottom item may be moved to get the muktzeh item to fall off.
Section four:  “Snot” may alternately be translated as “feces”, or some other type of disgusting material.  This “snot” is on a cushion which she wants to use.  To clean it off she must wipe it with a rag.  She can’t pour water over it because this is prohibited due to “laundering.”
Section five:  However, if the snot is on leather, she may pour water over it, because putting water over leather is not considered “laundering”. However, to actually launder the leather is prohibited.
