Mishnah Two
1) Shammai says:  “[Dough] of a kav or more is subject to the law of hallah.”   
a) And Hillel says: “Of two kavs or more.” 
b) But the Sages say: “Neither according to the opinion of this one nor according to the opinion of this one, but [dough of] a kav and a half is subject to the law of hallah.” 
2) And after they increased the measures they said:  “[Dough of] five quarters is subject. 
a) Rabbi Yose said:  “Five are exempt, five and more are liable.”

Explanation
Section one:  Numbers 15:20-21 commands Jews to set aside some of their dough and give it to the priests.  This is called “hallah”.  The question is how big of a batch of dough makes a person liable to separate hallah?  According to Shammai, if one mixes one kav of dough he must separate hallah to give to the priests.  A kav is about 1 ½ liters. According to Hillel, two kavs of dough make one obligated to separate hallah.  The Sages compromise between the two positions and state that 1 ½ kavs is sufficient to obligate for hallah.
Section two:  Later in the Mishnaic period, in Tsippori which is in the Galilee, the measure of weights were increased so that a kav was now larger than it used to be.  Therefore, the amount that obligates one to separate hallah became 1 1/5 kavs.  According to Rabbi Yose, exactly 1 1/5 kavs does not obligate one to separate hallah, but anything over that amount does.

Questions for Further Thought:
 Why should there be a minimum amount of dough to make one liable to separate hallah?  Why shouldn’t a person have to separate hallah from even a small amount of dough?
