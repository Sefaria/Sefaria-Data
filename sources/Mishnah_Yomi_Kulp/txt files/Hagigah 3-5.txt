Hagigah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Five

Introduction
The previous mishnah discussed when a person is trusted with regard to the purity of his things.  Today’s mishnah discusses another such rule—when is a pottery maker trusted that he has preserved the purity of his pots.

Mishnah Five
1) From Modi’im inwards [the potters] are trusted in regard to [the purity of] earthenware vessels; from Modi'im outwards they are not trusted.   
2) How so?  A potter who sells the pots entered inwards of Modi'im, then the same potter, the same pots and the same buyers are trusted [to be pure]. 
a) But if he went out [from Modi’im outwards] he is not trusted.

Explanation
Section one:  Modiim is famous for being the city where the Maccabees lived.  It is about 30 kilometers northwest of Jerusalem, about a day’s travel by foot.  (It is also where I live, but that won’t really help you understand this mishnah).  The closer a pottery maker is to Jerusalem the more it will be in his best interests to preserve the purity of his pottery because it is likely that people buying his goods may want to use them in connection with the sacrificial service.  Therefore, if the pottery-maker lives from Modiim and inwards toward Jerusalem, he is believed to say that his pots are pure. We should note that the Temple would have required many clay pots because they could be used only one time.  Once a clay pot was used to cook sacrificial meat it could no longer be used because the meat that was absorbed into the pot would become remnant (leftover sacrifice) which is forbidden. Therefore the pots had to be disposed of after one use.
Section two:  In this section we learn that the rule that the potter is believed when he is inside of the Modiim border is an absolute rule.  The same potter, pots and buyers that are trusted to be pure when they are between Modiim and Jerusalem are no longer believed to be pure when they go out beyond Modiim.
