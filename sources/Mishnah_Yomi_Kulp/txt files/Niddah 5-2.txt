Niddah, Chapter Five, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
1) If he was eating terumah when he felt that his limbs shook, he should take hold of his member and swallow the terumah. 
2) And it conveys uncleanness however small the quantity, even if it is only of the size of a mustard seed or less.

Explanation
Section one: If a man is eating terumah and he feels himself about to ejaculate (his limbs are shaking) he should squeeze his penis so that he doesn't ejaculate quite yet and then swallow the terumah. If he ejaculates while terumah is still in his mouth, the terumah will become impure. [I realize, this is a bit strange and I'm not sure if it's realistic. It would also take a large degree of control to accomplish this, but I guess anything's possible.]
Section two: Any amount of genital discharge (zivah, menstrual blood and semen), even an amount smaller than a mustard seed, defiles.
