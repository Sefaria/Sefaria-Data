Toharot, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Six

Mishnah Six
One who was standing and speaking by the edge of the cistern and some spittle squirted from his mouth, and there arises the doubt whether it reached the cistern or not, the condition of doubt is regarded as clean.

Explanation
If the spit went into the vat and reached the wine, the wine would be impure. However, the Tosefta explains that the Mishnah rules that the wine is pure because the spit may have been absorbed into the walls of the vat and it may not have reached the wine. Therefore, the vat is pure.
