Toharot, Chapter One, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Today's mishnah deals with loaves or pieces of dough that are stuck together. The principle is that if one loaf or piece of bread is defiled, they are all regarded as defiled. They retain this impurity even if they are later separated. 

Mishnah Seven
1) Pieces of dough which are stuck to each other  or loaves stuck to each other, if one of them was defiled from a sheretz, they all become unclean in the first degree;   
a) If they were then separated they are still regarded as having first degree uncleanness. 
2) If one of them was defiled by a liquid they all have second degree uncleanness;   
a) If they were then separated they are still regarded as have second degree uncleanness. 
3) If one of them was defiled from the hands, they all become have third degree uncleanness; 
a) If they were then separated they are still regarded as having third degree of uncleanness. 

Explanation
Section one: All of the loaves have first degree impurity because one had contact with the sheretz. They retain this even when they are separated.
Section two: Impure liquids always have first degree impurity. Therefore, the loaves or dough has second degree impurity.
Section three: Hands are considered to have second degree impurity. If the loaves are of terumah, they will be invalidated but not made impure. If the loaves were holy, then they are impure.
