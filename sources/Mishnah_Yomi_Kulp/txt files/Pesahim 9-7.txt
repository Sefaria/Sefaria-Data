Pesahim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Seven
 
Introduction
This mishnah deals with cases where an animal set aside to be a pesah offering cannot be offered as such.

Mishnah Seven
1) If a man sets aside a female for his pesah or a two-year old male, it should be left to graze until it becomes unfit, then it should be sold, and its money is spent on a voluntary sacrifice.
2) If a man separates his pesah and dies, his son after him should not bring it as a pesah but rather as a wellbeing offering.

Explanation
Section one:  The pesah offering must be brought from a one year old male goat or sheep (Exodus 12:5).  A female animal or a two-year old male animal is unfit for a pesah.  If a person set aside such an animal to be his pesah, then the animal is sacred despite the fact that it cannot be a pesah.  The animal should be left to graze until it becomes unfit, meaning it becomes blemished in such a way that it could not be offered as a pesah. Then it is sold and the proceeds are used to purchase voluntary sacrifices.  There is a variant reading of this mishnah according to which the proceeds of the sale are used to buy offerings of well-being, the offering that is usually brought in place of an unfit pesah.
Section two:  The father who set aside his pesah dies before he can offer it and there are no others registered to eat this pesah.  (Had others been registered there would have been no problem.)  The pesah now has no owners and therefore cannot be offered as a pesah.  The mishnah teaches that even the son who inherits from his father cannot offer it as a pesah.  In other words the son does not inherit his father’s registration for that sacrifice. Therefore it is sacrificed as a sacrifice of wellbeing.
