Shabbat, Chapter Six, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
The final mishnah of chapter six deals with carrying things which were believed to have healing powers.

Mishnah Ten 
One may go out with a locust’s egg, a fox’s tooth, and a nail from [the cross of] a crucified convict for purposes of healing, the words of Rabbi Meir’s view. 
But the sages say: even on weekdays this is forbidden on account of “the ways of the Amorite” [which Israelites are forbidden from adopting]. 

Explanation
The three things listed in this mishnah were believed to have healing powers.  The locust’s egg was believed to aid in healing the ear, the fox’s tooth helped people who slept too much and the nail was believed to heal wounds.  According to Rabbi Meir a person can carry these items on Shabbat since they were used for healing.  Wearing them is therefore not considered “carrying.”
The sages don’t really disagree that wearing these things is not considered “carrying.”  Rather, the sages say that it is always forbidden to use these things because they are “the ways of the Amorite.”  This refers to Leviticus 18:3 according to which Israelites should not imitate the nations that occupied Canaan.  The Rambam explains that anything which doctors state has medicinal value cannot be prohibited because of the “the ways of the Amorite.”  The only things that are prohibited are things which doctors say have not medicinal value but are believed by other nations to aid in healing.  We should note that in the ancient world, the distinction between medicine and superstition was far less clear than is the distinction today (and even today the line between the two is not always so clear.)
