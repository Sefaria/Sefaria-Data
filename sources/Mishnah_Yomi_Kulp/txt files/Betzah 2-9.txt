Betzah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
This mishnah is brought here on account of section three in yesterday’s mishnah which dealt with using a pepper-mill on Yom Tov.  As an aside, the mishnah teaches the susceptibility of a pepper-mill to impurities.

Mishnah Nine
A pepper-mill is susceptible to impurity on account of [it consisting of] three [separate] utensils; on account of a receptacle, on account of a metal utensil and on account of a sifting utensil.

Explanation
A pepper-mill has three separate parts. Our mishnah teaches that each part is itself considered a “vessel” and therefore each part on its own can receive impurities.  If one of the parts should break, while it can no longer become impure, because broken vessels are not receptive to impurities, the other two parts can still become impure.  
The bottom part of the pepper-mill is a wooden receptacle for the ground pepper.  All vessels which have a receptacle are susceptible to impurity.
The top part is made of metal. This is the part that grinds the pepper.  It is susceptible to impurity because it is metal and all metal vessels are susceptible to impurity, even if they don’t have a receptacle.
The middle part of the pepper-mill sifts the ground pepper.  Some commentators explain that since some of the pepper gets stuck here, this part is also considered to be a receptacle and hence susceptible to impurity.
