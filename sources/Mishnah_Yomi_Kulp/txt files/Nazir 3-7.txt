Nazir, Chapter Three, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah, while ostensibly discussing nazirite laws, is really discussing the laws of testimony.  Generally, when two sets of witnesses disagree, two saying one thing and two saying the other, the testimony is invalid.  However, if one set says that the defendant owes two hundred, and the other set says he owes five hundred, there is a dispute whether the defendant is liable for the lower amount, based on the principle that all witnesses agree that he owes at least two hundred.  Our mishnah deals with a similar case, except it uses naziriteships instead of money.

Mishnah Seven
One who has two sets of witnesses testifying about him:  one says that he vowed two [naziriteships] and the other that he vowed five: 
Beth Shammai says: the evidence is conflicting, and there is no naziriteship at all. 
But Beth Hillel says:  “five” includes “two”, so that he becomes a nazirite for two [naziriteships].

Explanation
According to Beth Shammai, the testimony is conflicting and therefore it is as if there is no testimony at all. However, Beth Hillel says that there is testimony from all sets regarding two naziriteships, and therefore he must observe two.
