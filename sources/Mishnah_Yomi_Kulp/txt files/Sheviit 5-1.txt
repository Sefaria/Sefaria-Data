Sheviit, Chapter Five, Mishnah One

Introduction 
When determining whether fruit is considered to be “fruit of the sabbatical year,” we go after the time that the fruit begins to appear on the tree.  Therefore, a fruit that begins to appear in the seventh year and is not picked for another two years is considered to be “sabbatical fruit” and all of the laws governing this “sabbatical fruit” will apply to this fruit, even though it is picked long after the seventh year is over.

Mishnah One
1) White figs: their “sheviit” is in the second year [of the sabbatical year], since they ripen once in three years. 
2) Rabbi Judah says: Persian figs, their “sheviit” is in the year following the seventh year, since they ripen once in two years. 
a) Thereupon they said to him: this was said only of the species of white figs.

Explanation 
Section one: White figs take three years to ripen. Hence, white figs that begin to appear on the tree during the seventh year will be picked three years later during the second year of the sabbatical cycle. This fruit will have the status of “sabbatical fruit.”
Section two: Rabbi Judah says that a similar law applies to Persian figs which take two years to ripen. The other rabbis respond that the law stated in section one was stated only in regard to the white figs. All other fruit ripen in one year. It seems that they are disagreeing here about reality. The other rabbis seem to say that all fruit (at least the fruit which were known to them) is fully ripe the same year that it begins to grow, with the one exception of the white fig. Rabbi Judah says that there are other species to which this halakhah applies, including the Persian fig.
