Mishnah Four
1) [With regard to] a flagon that is full of pure liquid, the flagon is defiled with seven days' impurity but the liquid remains clean.   
a) But if one poured it out into another vessel, it becomes unclean.   
2) If a woman was kneading [in the upper story] at a trough, the woman and the trough become unclean with seven days impurity, but the dough remains clean
a) But if one turned it out into another vessel, it becomes unclean. 
3) Bet Hillel changed their opinion and taught as Bet Shammai.  

Explanation
Section one: In this scenario there is a flagon (a small jar) made of metal or wood that is found in the upper story of a house where a pot is blocking the hatch and there is a source of corpse impurity in the lower story. Our mishnah rules like Bet Shammai (and like Bet Hillel after they too began to rule like Bet Shammai). Since this flagon can be purified in a mikveh, it is defiled by the corpse impurity found in the bottom floor. The liquid remains clean. 
However, if he pours the liquid out into another vessel that is found in the upper story, the liquid is defiled by contact with the other vessel.
Section two: In this scenario, a woman is found kneading in the upper story. The woman and the kneading trough are impure because they can be cleansed in a mikveh. However, the dough cannot be cleansed in a mikveh so it is pure. 
Again, if he moves the dough to another vessel, it too is unclean.
Section three: Bet Hillel would have originally opposed the above halakhot, but they changed their mind and ruled like Bet Hillel, just as they did in yesterday's mishnah.
