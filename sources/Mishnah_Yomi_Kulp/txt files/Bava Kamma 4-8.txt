Bava Kamma Chapter Four Mishnah Eight


Mishnah Eight
1) If an ox goes out to be stoned, and its owners dedicated it to the Temple, it is not considered dedicated.
a) If he slaughtered it, its flesh is forbidden.
2) But if before its sentence was complete its owner dedicated it, it is dedicated.
a) If he slaughtered it, its flesh is permitted.

Explanation

Mishnah Eight deals with an owner of a goring ox who tried to “cheat the system” by either dedicating the ox to the Temple, and thereby getting credit for a sacrifice, or by ritually slaughtering the ox, and thereby getting food to eat and the leather from the hide.  We learned in the aforementioned verses in Exodus that the ox must be executed and its meat is forbidden for use.  Our mishnah tells us that this is so only if its sentence has already been pronounced by the court.  If it has not, and a person should either dedicate it or slaughter it, the person’s actions are valid and either the Temple or the person himself may derive benefit from the ox.
