Sheviit, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah deals with various other halakhot that have to do with “the second rainfall.”

Mishnah Seven 
1) Similarly, if one rents a house to someone “until the rains,”—he means until the second rainfall.
2) Or if one had vowed not to derive any benefit from his friend “until the rains”—[he is prohibited] until the second rainfall. 
3) Until when may the poor enter the orchards?  Until the second rainfall.   
4) And when may one begin to enjoy or burn the straw and stubble of sabbatical produce?   After the second rainfall. 

Explanation
Sections one and two:  The meaning of “until the rains” is established by our mishnah as being until the second rainfall.
Section three: In non-sabbatical years the poor can enter the orchards to collect various types of produce that are given to the poor (forgotten foods, corners of the fields, dropped food—all of this was discussed at length in Peah). They can enter the orchard after the second rains have fallen. 
Section four: Straw and stubble that are animal food cannot be burned during the sabbatical year. However, once the second rainfall has come and ruined the straw and stubble which is still found in the field, one can burn that which remains in his home and even derive benefit from such burning.
