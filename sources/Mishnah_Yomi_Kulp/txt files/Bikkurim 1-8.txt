Bikkurim, Chapter One, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah deals with a person whose bikkurim are either lost or ruined.

Mishnah Eight
1) If one set aside his bikkurim and they were robbed, or rotted, were stolen or lost, or became unclean, he must bring others in their place, but does not recite [the declaration].
2) These others are not subject to the law of the [added] fifth.   
3) If they become unclean while in the Temple court, he must scatter them and he does not recite.

Explanation
Section one: Once a person sets aside his bikkurim he is responsible for them and if they are lost or ruined by either rotting or becoming impure, he must bring new bikkurim in their place. We shall learn the reason for this in tomorrow’s mishnah. However, when he brings the second set of bikkurim he cannot make the recitation because these are not actually “the first of his fruits.”
Section two: The rules governing bikkurim are like the rules governing terumah. If a non-priest eats them he must bring an added fifth. We will return to this subject in 2:1. Our mishnah teaches that this is so only with regard to the original first fruits. If a non-priest eats the replacement fruits, he is not liable to replace what he ate, but not to bring an added fifth. In essence, what the mishnah is saying is that the replacement fruits are not really bikkurim.
Section three: Once he brings the fruit to the Temple court he is no longer responsible to replace them if they are lost or stolen. If they are become impure he cannot present them to the priest so what he should do is shake out the basket.
