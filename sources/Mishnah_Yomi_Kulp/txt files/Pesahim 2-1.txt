Pesahim, Chapter Two, Mishnah One

Introduction
The second chapter continues chronologically where the first chapter left off—with rules concerning the removal of chametz.  

Mishnah One
1) Any hour in which one is permitted to eat [chametz], one may feed it to cattle, beasts and birds, and one may sell it to a gentile, and benefit from it is permitted. 
a) When its time has passed benefit from it is forbidden, and he may not [even] fire an oven or a stove with it. 
2) Rabbi Judah says: there is no removal of chametz except by burning;
a) But the sages say: he may also crumble it and throw it to the wind or cast it into the sea.

Explanation 
Section one:  As long as one may eat chametz on the day before Pesah, one may still derive benefit from it (see 1:4).  This mishnah is opposed to Rabbi Judah’s opinion above in 1:4, where he states that during the fifth hour it is forbidden to eat chametz, but it is still permitted to derive benefit from it.  The mishnah lists two of the most common ways to derive benefit from a food item without eating it—giving it to animals and selling it to non-Jews.
Once the time has passed, he may derive no benefit from the chametz.  Even while he is burning it in order to destroy it, he may not put it in an oven or stove to use it as fuel.  In other words, he must burn it in such a way that he derives no benefit. 
Section two:  In this section the rabbis dispute how chametz is to be removed in order to fulfill the commandment found in Exodus 12:15, “you shall remove leaven from your house.”  According to Rabbi Judah the chametz must be burned.  This is how he interprets the word “remove” in the verse.  The sages are more flexible and accept other means by which to remove/destroy the chametz—casting it into the sea or by crumbling it up and throwing it into the wind.  The important thing is that he not be able to recover the chametz and eat it, or even possess it.
