Kilayim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah deals with reed canes that protrude from an aris but that don’t have vines hanging on them.

Mishnah Eight
1) Canes which protrude from the aris and one is too concerned for them to cut them short, it is permitted to sow directly beneath them. 
2) If he made them [long] so that the new [growth] might spread along them, it is forbidden [two sow underneath].

Explanation
Section one:  In this case the only reason that he hasn’t cut the unused canes down is that he doesn’t want to destroy them.  He has no plans to train the vines over these canes. Therefore, he may sow seeds directly beneath them.
Section two: In this case, he does plan to use the canes as part of the aris.  Hence, even before he does use them, it is forbidden to sow seeds underneath.
