Mishnah Six
1)   She may go out with the sela on a callus. 
2)   Young girls may go out with threads, and even with chips in their ears.     
3)   Arabian women may go out veiled.
4)   Medean women may go out with their cloaks thrown over their shoulders.     
5)   Indeed, all people [may do likewise] but that the sages spoke of prevailing custom. 

Explanation
Section one:  They would put a coin on a callus to help heal it.  Since it was tied to the foot, the rabbis were not concerned lest it be removed and the owner carry it in the public domain.
Section two:  Threads and chips were used in piercing girls’ ears.  After the initial piercing, they would put a thread in to begin the hole and eventually they would put in a wood chip to widen the hole.  When the hole was large enough they would put in an earring.  Since the strings and chips are not regularly removed, they may be worn in the public domain.  
Sections 3-4:  These sections refer to the customs of certain women from certain origins.  Women from Arab lands would wear veils and those from Medea (Persia) would wear cloaks over their shoulders (like capes).  The straps of the cloaks were connected by a tie with a nut, coin or small stone.    
Section five:  Although sections three and four single out Arabian and Medean women, anyone may wear these things.  The only reason that these women were singled out is that these were commonly worn by certain women.
