Sotah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This is the final mishnah which deals with the neck-breaking regulations.  It discusses a case where there is some but not full testimony about the identity of the murderer.  

Mishnah Eight
1) If one witness says “I saw the murderer” and one witness says “You did not see him”; or if a woman says “I saw him” and another woman says “You did not see him”, they break its neck. 
2) If one witness says “I saw him” and two say “You did not see him”, they break its neck. 
3) If two say “We saw him” and one says to them “You did not see him”, they do not break its neck.  

Explanation
This mishnah is nearly identical to that which we saw regarding adultery and the drinking of the sotah waters above (mishnah 6:4).  
Section one:  The testimony of the first witness is contradicted by that of the second witness; each witness’s testimony nullifies that of the other.  Since there is no testimony regarding the identity of the murderer, the heifer’s neck must be broken.  The same is true if both witnesses are women.  
Section two:  In this case, after one witness testifies to the identity of the murderer, two witnesses that the first witness did not see the murder.  The testimony of the two outweighs that of the single witness, and the heifer’s neck must be broken.
Section three:  Since two witnesses say they saw the murder, a single witness who says they did not see the murder cannot nullify their testimony.  Hence, the identity has been established, and the heifer’s neck is not broken.
