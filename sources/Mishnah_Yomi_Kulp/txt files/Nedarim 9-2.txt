Nedarim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Two

Introduction
The debate in this mishnah is over whether or not a vow can be released if the one who vowed regrets his vow because of something that happened since the vow was made.  The mishnah brings two examples of these types of situations.  As in yesterday’s mishnah the Sages argue with Rabbi Eliezer.

Mishnah Two
Rabbi Eliezer also said: They release a vow by reference to a new fact; but the Sages forbid it. 
How is this so?
If one said, “Konam that I will not benefit from so and so,” and he [the latter] then became a scribe, or was about to give his son in marriage, and he said, “Had I known that he would become a scribe or was about to give his son in marriage, I would not have vowed;” 
[Or if he said,] “Konam, is this house that I will not enter,” and it became a synagogue, and he declared, “Had I known that it would become a synagogue, I would not have vowed,”—Rabbi Eliezer permits [the vow to be released],but the Sages forbid it.

Explanation
According to Rabbi Eliezer if something new happens since the vow was taken, the recent occurrence may be grounds to release the one who vowed from his vow.  The mishnah illustrates this with two examples.  In the first, a person vows that a certain so-and-so should not benefit from him, but then later on so-and-so either becomes a scribe, meaning a teacher of Bible, or is about to give his son in marriage.  Similarly, one vows that he will not enter a certain house, and then it becomes a synagogue.  The one who vowed claims that had he known these things would happen, he would not have made his vow.  Rabbi Eliezer allows this new fact to be grounds for the release of the vow, but the sages do not.  The Sages reason that since the new fact did not exist when he vowed, we cannot say that the vow was made by mistake.  Rather the one who vowed did not take into account all future possibilities.  That is not sufficient grounds for releasing the vow.
