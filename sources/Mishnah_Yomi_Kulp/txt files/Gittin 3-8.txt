Gittin, Chapter Three, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
The previous several mishnayoth taught that a person need not be concerned lest someone might have died.  Our mishnah teaches that a person need not be concerned lest some produce that he set aside has spoiled.  

Mishnah Eight
1) If a man sets aside produce in order to count it as terumah and tithe, or money in order to count it as second tithe, he may continue to count it as such in the presumption that they still exist. 
2) If they are lost, he must be concerned from time period to time period, the words of Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua. 
a) Rabbi Judah says: at three seasons they check the wine: when the east wind begins to blow at the end of Sukkot, when the buds first appear [on the vine], and when the juice begins to form in the grapes.

Explanation
Section one: The person here set aside some produce in another place for it to count as tithe so that he could eat other produce without tithing it. Or he set aside some money to count it as the redemption money for second tithe. This redemption money will eventually be brought to Jerusalem and consumed there. He may continue to eat his produce, assuming that the things he set aside still exist.
Section two: According to R. Elazar b. Shammua, if he comes back and discovers that the produce is lost, meaning it has gone bad, he must assume that it was lost within the last 24 hours. This means that he had unwittingly eaten untithed produce for the last 24 hours, and will have to repay that amount to the priests.
R. Judah says that they check the wine at only three seasons to ensure that it has not gone bad. Thus he would have to assume that any wine he had left over in order for it to count as tithes and terumah had spoiled some time between the last check and the current period.
