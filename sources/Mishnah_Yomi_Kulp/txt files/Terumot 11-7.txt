Terumot, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Yesterday we learned that when one is cleaning out a storehouse of terumah wheat, one can clean it out in a normal fashion and he need not be worried about cleaning out every last grain of terumah. In today’s mishnah we learn that the same halakhah is true when one comes to clean up a spill of terumah oil.

Mishnah Seven
Similarly, if a jar of oil is upset, they do not need to force him to sit down and scoop it up [with his fingers], but he may deal with it as he would in a case of hullin.
