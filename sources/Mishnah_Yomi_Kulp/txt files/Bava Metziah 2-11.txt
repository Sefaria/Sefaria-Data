Explanation
In the beginning of this mishnah we learn that one’s own financial loss takes priority even over that of a father or a teacher (of Torah).  The Torah expects people to help others but it also understands that people have a natural desire to help themselves.  
The remainder of the mishnah deals with conflicts between helping his father and helping his teacher.  In all of them we learn that his teacher (one who teaches him Torah) takes priority.  Through this mishnah we can see how much the Rabbis valued learning and Torah study.  His father brings him into this world and for that the Torah commands that he respect and fear his father.  However, the teacher brings him into the world to come, and this is a greater responsibility even then being a father.  Therefore the teacher receives even more respect than the father.  However, if his father is a Sage, meaning learned in Torah, he deserves greater respect from his son than does another teacher/Sage, and he therefore takes priority.  

Questions for Further Thought:
Mishnah eleven:  Why do you think that his own lost object always takes priority?  Is this not selfishness?
