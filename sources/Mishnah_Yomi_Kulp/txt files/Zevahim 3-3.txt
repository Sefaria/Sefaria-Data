Zevahim, Chapter Three, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah lists cases in which a person has an improper intention while sacrificing the animal but this improper intention does not render the sacrifice invalid.

Mishnah Three
1) If one slaughters the sacrifice [intending] to eat what is not normally eaten, or to burn [on the altar] what is not normally burned [outside of the time or place the sacrifice must be eaten or burned], it is valid; 
a) But Rabbi Eliezer invalidates [the sacrifice].   
2) [If he slaughters it intending] to eat what is normally eaten and to burn what is normally burned [outside of the time or place the sacrifice must be eaten or burned], [but] less than the size of an olive, it is valid. 
3) To eat half as much as an olive and to burn half as much as an olive [outside of the time or place the sacrifice must be eaten or burned], it is valid, because [intentions concerning] eating and burning do not combine. 

Explanation
Section one:  Normally, having an intention to eat or burn something outside of the place or time it should be eaten or burned will invalidate a sacrifice. However, here he intends to burn or eat something that is not normally burned or eaten. Therefore, this improper intention does not render the sacrifice invalid. Rabbi Eliezer disagrees and holds that an improper intention even concerning that which is not normally eaten or burned will still render the sacrifice invalid. 
Section two: Here his improper intention was to do the action with less than an olive’s worth of the sacrifice, and therefore the sacrifice is still valid.
Section three: As we learned in 2:5, improper intentions with regard to eating a sacrifice and burning a sacrifice do not join together to add up to the requisite olive’s worth. Therefore, the sacrifice is still valid.
