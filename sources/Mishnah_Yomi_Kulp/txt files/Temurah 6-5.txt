Temurah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
1) With regard to any animals that are disqualified for the altar, their offspring are permitted for the altar. 
2) The offspring of a terefah: Rabbi Elazar says it may not be offered on the altar.   
3) Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: a ritually clean animal which nursed from a terefah is disqualified from the altar. 
4) Any dedicated animal which became terefah one may not dedicate them, since we may not redeem dedicated [animals] in order to give them to dogs to eat.

Explanation
Section one: If an animal cannot be offered for the altar, for instance an animal given as prostitute’s fee or the price of a dog (see mishnah three), its offspring can still be offered.
Section two: Rabbi Elazar says that when it comes to a terefah, an animal with a physical defect that will eventually cause it to die, the offspring cannot be offered. Evidently, according to Rabbi Elazar, such a defect is inherited.
Section three: The milk in this animal’s stomach is prohibited because it comes from a terefah. Therefore, according to Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus, it is prohibited from the altar. 
Section four: One cannot dedicate a living terefah to be a sacrifice because there would be nothing to do with that animal. It cannot be offered on the altar because it is a terefah. It cannot be redeemed, because the only thing one could do with it after it is redeemed is feed it to the dogs, and this is considered disgraceful to a formerly holy thing. Therefore, one should not dedicate it in the first place.
