Niddah, Chapter One, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
1) How [does the rule that] it suffices [to reckon her period of uncleanness from] the time she discovers the flow work?
2) If she was sitting on a bed and was occupied with ritually clean objects and then she leaves [the bed] and then sees [blood flow] she is unclean but the objects are clean.
3) Even though they have said that she conveys uncleanness for a period of twenty-four hours [retroactively]   she counts [the seven days of her menstruation]   only from the time she observed the flow.

Explanation
Section one: This refers to a woman that has a regular menstrual cycle. As we learned in yesterday's mishnah, she is considered to be impure only from the moment in which she observes a blood flow. She doesn’t retroactively defile anything. 
Section two: Although in this case it is exceedingly likely that the blood flow started while she was still in bed, since she has a regular cycle, only the things that she touched after she discovered the blood flow are impure. The bed and any other pure things she touched earlier remain pure. This seems to be a case in which the rabbis rule created an intentional leniency, one that might even be seen as ignoring what likely happened. 
Section three: This section addresses a woman who does not have a regular menstrual cycle and therefore retroactively defiles anything she touched in the 24 hour period before she discovered that she was bleeding. Nevertheless, when it comes to counting the days of her menstruation during which she is impure, she does not count from the earlier time period. She counts from when she noticed that she was bleeding. This is because the 24 hour period is a stringency—she may have been bleeding as early at that period therefore anything she touched must be considered impure. But since she only knows that she began menstruating at a later time, she counts her days only from then.
