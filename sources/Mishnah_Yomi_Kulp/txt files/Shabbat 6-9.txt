Mishnah Nine 
Boys may go out with garlands and children of royalty children may go out with bells, and all people [may do likewise], but the sages spoke of the usual practice.

Explanation
Boys may go out with garlands, which according to the Talmud were made to protect them from evil.  Children of royalty may go out with bells.  The mishnah adds that anyone may go out with a bell. The mishnah mentioned royalty because they were the ones who typically did so.
