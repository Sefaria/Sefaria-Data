Temurah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three 
What is meant by the “price of a dog”?   
1) If one says to his fellow, here is this lamb instead of [this] dog.   
2) And similarly if two partners divided [an estate] and one took ten lambs and the other nine and a dog, all those taken in place of the dog are forbidden [for the altar], but those taken with a dog are valid [for the altar]. 
3) An animal that is the fee of a dog and the price of a prostitute are permitted [for the altar], since it says: “[For] both [of these]” (Deuteronomy 23:19): both’ but not four.   
4) Their offspring are permitted [for the altar since it says]: “[Both of these]” implying they but not their offspring.

Explanation
Section one: The price of a dog means an animal used to pay for a dog. Such an animal cannot be used as a sacrifice. Assumedly, the dog was considered a lowly animal in the biblical world and therefore something used to buy a dog itself had a lowly status and could not be used a sacrifice.
Section two: The lamb taken by one partner in exchange for the dog taken by the other partner is considered to be the “price of a dog.” 
Section three: The mishnah here reverses the biblical “prostitute’s fee and price of a dog” and comes up with “the fee of a dog and price of a prostitute.” The “fee of a dog” is when someone gives a lamb to his fellow in return for a dog to be used for sexual relations (I know, a bit sick, but that’s what it says). The “price of a prostitute” refers to a case where one exchanges a prostitute for a lamb. These lambs are not prohibited because the Torah prohibits only two things—the prostitute’s fee and the price of a dog. Any other combo, no matter how morally troubling, does not cause the lamb to become prohibited.
Section four: Only the animal itself is prohibited, not their offspring.
