Shabbat, Chapter One, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah does not actually teach any halakhah.  Rather it places the halakhot which we learned above in an historical context.
 
Mishnah Four
And these are of halakhot which they stated in the upper chamber of Hananiah ben Hezekiah ben Gurion, when they went up to visit him. 
They took a count, and Bet Shammai outnumbered Beth Hillel and on that day they enacted eighteen measures.

Explanation 
This mishnah begins by teaching that the halakhot which were taught in the previous several mishnayot were stated on a famous, somewhat legendary and obscure, day in the history of the rabbis when the Sages visited the upper chamber of Hananiah ben Hezekiah ben Gurion.    
According to the Rambam, the “eighteen measures” mentioned in section two refer to eighteen halakhot stated from the beginning of the tractate until this point.  According to this interpretation, these were eighteen prohibitions about which Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel agreed. Mishnah 1 lists eight things, and there are five in both mishnayot 2 and 3 (these could be counted in different ways).  The Rambam holds that on that day they made eighteen enactments, which are not listed in our mishnah.  They also disagreed over eighteen issues, and thirteen of these will be listed in the upcoming mishnayot.  The remainder of the disagreements are listed elsewhere.  
There are several other ways to understand this mishnah, but the Rambam’s seems to be straightforward.  Some explain that the mishnah does not refer to those things halakhoth that are found in the above mishnayot but that it refers to a list preserved in the Talmud.  
However, we understand the mishnah, we should note how unusual it is.  Rarely do mishnayoth provide us with information about where or when they were taught.  Although we cannot be sure of what happened on that day in the upper chamber, it certainly was a day that became legendary in the mind of the rabbis.
