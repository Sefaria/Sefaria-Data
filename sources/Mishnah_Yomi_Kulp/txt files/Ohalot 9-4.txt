Ohalot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Today's mishnah continues to discuss the hive that is either defective or stuck firmly into the doorway of the house. Similar to mishnah two, it adds in the scenario of the hive being slightly above ground level. 

Mishnah Four
[In the case of such a hive] being [placed] one handbreadth high off the ground: 
1) If there is uncleanness below it or in the house, [the space] below it and the house become unclean,   but [the space] above and within remains clean.   
2) [If the uncleanness is] in the hive, nothing is unclean except what is within; 
3) If above [the hive] what is directly above up to the sky becomes unclean. 

Explanation
Section one: Since there is the space of a handbreadth beneath the hive, the hive acts as an ohel and conveys the impurity to the sides and it also enters the house. However, the inside of the hive and the space above it remain pure because the ohel acts as a barrier to impurity. 
Section two: If the impurity is within the hive, only the inside is unclean (as in mishnah three).
Section three: As in yesterday's mishnah, if the impurity is above the hive, the impurity travels up but not down.
