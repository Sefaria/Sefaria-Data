Mishnah Ten
1) If one leased a field from his fellow for “a week of years” (seven years) for 700 zuz, the Seventh Year is included in the number.
a) If he leased it for “seven years” for 700 zuz, the Seventh Year is not included in the number.

Explanation—Mishnah Ten
During the Seventh Year Jews living in the Land of Israel are not allowed to work their fields (See Exodus 23:10-11, Leviticus 25:1-7).  If a Jew rented a piece of land in the Land of Israel he would not, therefore, be able to work it or derive benefit from it during the Seventh Year.  Our mishnah states that the inclusion of the Seventh Year as one of the years in the rental agreement depends on the language of the agreement.  If he used inclusive language, stating “a week of years” then the Seventh Year is included.  If however, he merely stated “seven years” then he receives seven years in which he would be allowed to plant and harvest.  In such a case he would actually keep the land through the eighth year.

Questions for Further Thought:
 Mishnah Ten:  What would happen if someone rented a piece of land on the fifth year of a Sabbatical cycle and the agreement was for four years?  Would the Seventh (Sabbatical) Year count as one of the years or not?
