Betzah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Introduction
In mishnaic times it was customary for people who observed the laws of purity to immerse vessels and for people to immerse before Yom Tov so that everything would be pure.  In our mishnah Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel debate whether or not one can immerse on Shabbat in preparation for a Yom Tov which falls on Sunday.

Mishnah Two 
If [Yom Tov] fell on the day after Shabbat:
1) Bet Shammai says: one must immerse everything [unclean] before Shabbat.
2) But Bet Hillel says: vessels [must be immersed] before Shabbat but people [may immerse] on Shabbat.

Explanation
Section one:  According to Bet Shammai both vessels and people must be immersed before Shabbat.  They hold that it is forbidden to immerse on Shabbat.
Section two:  Bet Hillel holds that it is permitted to immerse on Shabbat but that one should nevertheless immerse the vessels before Shabbat.  The reason not to immerse the vessels on Shabbat is that by immersing the vessels he makes them usable. This is like “completing a vessel” which is forbidden on Shabbat.  However, when a person immerses him/herself it might just look like she/he is washing, and hence it is permitted.
