Shevuoth, Chapter Three, Mishnah Eleven

Introduction
This mishnah is similar to the previous mishnah except that it discusses the vain oath.  The end of the mishnah discusses a similarity between the two oaths: in both cases one person can adjure another person.
 
Mishnah Eleven
1) A vain oath applies to men and women, to relatives and non-relatives, to those qualified [to bear witness] and those not qualified, [whether uttered] before the court, or not before the court, [but it must be uttered] with a man's own mouth.   
a) And he is liable, for intentional transgression, stripes, and for unintentional transgression he is exempt. 
2) [In the case of] both this and that [oath], if he was adjured by the mouth of others, he is liable.  
a) How so? 
b) If he said, “I have not eaten today,” or, “I have not put on tefillin today” [and the another person said,] “I adjure thee,” and he said, “Amen!”, he is liable [if his oath was false].

Explanation
Section one:  This section is the same as the previous mishnah.  It is here only to contrast it with the rules of the testimonial oath taught in the next chapter.
Section two:  A person need not utter the entire oath on his own in order for it to be valid.  If he makes a statement without using the language of an oath, and then another person adjures him with regards to the truth of his words, and he answers “amen”, he has sworn an oath.  In this case his answer “amen” to another person using the language of an oath makes it as if he himself swore.  If his oath is false he will be liable.
