Mishnah Eleven
1) Two men who were drawing water for the hatat and one assisted the other to raise it or one pulled out a thorn for the other:
a) For one mixture, it is valid; 
b) For two mixtures, it is invalid. 
2) Rabbi Yose says: even if there are to be two mixtures it is valid if they had made a mutual agreement between them.

Explanation
Section one: Two men help each other in drawing the water for the hatat red cow ritual. They help each either in raising the buckets or in pulling thorns out of each other's hands while the other raises the bucket. If they are making one mixture, then the water is valid because these "labors" are both for the mixture being prepared. Neither man does any work to draw water that will not be used in the mixture he is preparing. However, if they are making two separate mixtures then each man's helping the other is considered an interruption and the water is invalid.
Section two: Rabbi Yose says that if they made a prior arrangement to help each other then both drawings are valid. This is because when A helps B he is really helping to get help in return. It turns out that his help of A was really for his own drawing, and in such a case the water remains valid.
