Niddah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Our mishnah is related to yesterday's mishnah where we learned that if the woman sees blood some time after having had intercourse she only defiles her husband from "doubt." The mishnah explains how long is considered "after time." 

Mishnah Three
1) What is meant by "after a time"? As long as it takes to get down from the bed and wash her "face."   
2) [If blood was found some time] after she causes uncleanness retrospectively for a period of twenty-four hours but she does not cause the man who had intercourse with her to be unclean.   
a) Rabbi Akiva says: she also causes the man who had intercourse with her to be unclean.
3) And the sages agree with Rabbi Akiva that one who saw a bloodstain defiles the man who had intercourse with her.

Explanation
Section one: "After a time" is considered to be as long as it would take the woman to get down from the bed and wash her "face." The word "face" here is another euphemism for the woman's vagina.   
Section two: If she finds blood after this time, then she is still impure in the usual way. Everything she has touched in the last 24 hour period (or less if she examined herself during this period) is impure. However, she does not cause her husband to be defiled. In other words there are three time periods. If she finds blood immediately, he is certainly impure. If she finds it "after a time" meaning during the time period in which she could get off the bed and clean herself, he is doubtfully impure. If she finds it later, he is not impure. 
Rabbi Akiva says that he is impure. Evidently, Rabbi Akiva does not believe that there is much doubt here that she was already menstruating when they had intercourse. 
Section three: The sages agree with Rabbi Akiva in a case where she finds a bloodstain on her clothing or on the sheet. This bloodstain is a more certain sign that she was menstruating when they had intercourse. Therefore the rabbis rule stringently.
