Shabbat, Chapter Sixteen, Mishnah Eight

Introduction 
The central point of this mishnah is that if a Gentile does a prohibited labor on Shabbat for his own benefit, then an Israelite may make use of what the Gentile did.  However, if the Gentile does on the Israelite’s behalf, it is prohibited for the Jew to benefit from it.  A Jew can certainly not tell a non-Jew to perform for the Jew on Shabbat an activity which the Jew himself may not perform.  According to the mishnah, even if the Gentile did it without being told, if he did it on the Jew’s behalf it is forbidden.  

Mishnah Eight
1) If a Gentile lights a lamp, an Israelite may make use of its light.
a) But if [he does it] for the sake of the Israelite, it is forbidden. 
2) If he draws water to give his own animal to drink, an Israelite may water his [animal] after him.
a) But if [he draws it] for the Israelite’s sake, it is forbidden. 
3) If a Gentile makes a plank to descend [off a ship by] it, an Israelite may descend after him; 
a) But if on the Israelite’s account, it is forbidden. 
b) It once happened that Rabban Gamaliel and the elders were traveling in a ship, when a Gentile made a plank for getting off, and Rabban Gamaliel, and the elders descended by it.

Explanation
Section two:  The reason that drawing water is prohibited is that the cistern from which the water is drawn is considered a “private domain” and the cistern itself is found in the public domain.  Taking water out of the cistern is therefore prohibited because of “carrying.”
Section three:   Laying down the plank is forbidden because it is considered “building.”  Rabban Gamaliel and the other elders descended because the Gentile had made the plank for his own use, or at least for his own use as well as the use of others.
