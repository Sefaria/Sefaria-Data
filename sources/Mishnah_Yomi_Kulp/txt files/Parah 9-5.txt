Parah, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
1) Hatat water that became invalid, it may not be mixed into the mud since it might become a snare for others. 
a) Rabbi Judah says: it becomes neutralized. 
2) A cow that drank of the hatat water, its flesh becomes unclean for twenty-four hours. 
a) Rabbi Judah says: it becomes neutralized in its bowels.  

Explanation
Section one: Hatat water causes someone who comes into contact with it to become impure, even after the water has been disqualified from use. So if one takes disqualified hatat waters and mixes them in mud (to use them, I assume) anyone who touches the mud will be impure but he won't know that he is. Then he might go eat terumah while impure, which is forbidden.
Rabbi Judah says that the hatat waters are neutralized by being in the mud. They no longer convey impurity, so he may mix them up.
Section two: The assumption is that the water remains in the cow for 24 hours. So if the cow is slaughtered within that time period, its flesh is impure. If he slaughters it afterwards, the flesh is pure.
Again, Rabbi Judah says that the waters are neutralized when they are absorbed into something larger. The flesh does not convey impurity, even if the animal is slaughtered immediately.
