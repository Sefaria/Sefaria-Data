Betzah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah deals with bringing certain sacrifices on Yom Tov and laying one’s hands upon them (see Leviticus 3:2).

Mishnah Four 
1) Bet Shammai says: one may bring peace-offerings [on Yom Tov] but may not lay [hands] upon them, but one may not bring burnt-offerings [on Yom Tov].
2) Bet Hillel says: one may bring peace-offerings and burnt-offerings and also lay hands upon them.

Explanation
Section one:  One of the sacrifices which a person would bring on Yom Tov was a peace-offering.  Part of the sacrifice would be offered on the altar, part would be eaten by the priests and part would be eaten by those who brought the sacrifice. Since this sacrifice is eaten, Bet Shammai allows one to offer it on Yom Tov.  As we have learned before one is allowed to prepare food on Yom Tov, and this includes offering edible sacrifices. However, Bet Shammai holds that one cannot lay his hands on the sacrifice because leaning on an animal is considered using the animal and this is prohibited on Yom Tov.  Bet Shammai holds that the laying of the hands must be done the day before. Furthermore, Bet Shammai does not allow the sacrifice of burnt-offerings on Yom Tov, because burnt offerings are completely consumed on the altar.  Since they are not eaten they cannot be offered.  One who wants to bring a burnt-offering would have to do so on Hol Hamoed, the intermediate days of the festival.
Section two:  Bet Hillel allows the laying of the hands on the animal since this is part of the sacrificial process. The Talmud also explains that according to Bet Hillel the laying of the hands must be done right before it is offered, and therefore he could not do it before Yom Tov.  Bet Hillel also allows burnt offerings to be brought even though they are not eaten, since they are brought in fulfillment of the commandments of the festival.
