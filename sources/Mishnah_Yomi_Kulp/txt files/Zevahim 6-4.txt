Mishnah Four
How was the hatat of a bird sacrificed?  
1) He pinches off its head behind its neck, but he did not sever it.
2) And he would sprinkle its blood on the wall of the altar.
3) The residue of the blood was drained out on the base. 
4) Only the blood belonged to the altar, while the rest of it belonged to the priests.

Explanation
Section one: Birds are not slaughtered to be sacrifices in the same way that birds are slaughtered to be eaten. To make a bird kosher, the shochet slices its neck, the same way that he does for an animal. But for sacrificing, the priest pinches off its head off with his thumbnail from the back of the bird’s neck. See Leviticus 5:8-9. He does not sever the head entirely from the body, just separates it by pinching it off. 
Sections two-three: After pinching off its head, he sprinkles the blood out of the bird onto the wall of the altar. Note that its blood is not received in a ministering vessel. The residue of the blood is squeezed out of the bird onto the base of the altar.
Section four: The rest of the bird was eaten by priests—only the blood was put on the altar.
