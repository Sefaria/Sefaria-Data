Berakhot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Four

Introduction 
Our mishnah teaches that if people are eating a meal together they may not separate to recite Birkat Hamazon if this will cause them to recite a lesser zimun , or no zimun at all.

Mishnah Four
1) Three persons who have eaten together may not separate [to recite Birkat Hamazon].   
a) Similarly four and similarly five.   
2) Six may separate, up until ten. 
3) And ten may not separate until there are twenty.

Explanation
Section one:  A group of three, four or five people eating together cannot separate into two groups to recite Birkat Hamazon because that will leave some people without the ability to say any zimun.  
Section two:  A group of six to ten, but not including ten, can separate because their zimun will not change, provided that each group still has at least three.  
Section three: Once the group reaches ten it can’t separate because if it does, not everyone will be able to say God’s name as part of the zimun.  Since the zimun for ten is greater than the zimun for three, the group of more than ten people cannot split up until there are ten left for each group, meaning there are twenty.
