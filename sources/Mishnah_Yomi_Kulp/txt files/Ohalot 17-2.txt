Ohalot, Chapter Seventeen, Mishnah Two

Mishnah Two
1) If a person was plowing and struck against a rock or a fence, or if he shook the plowshare, he only makes a bet peras up until that spot. 
2) Rabbi Eliezer says: one bet peras can form another bet peras.   
3) Rabbi Joshua says: sometimes it can, but at other times it cannot. 
a) How so? If he plowed for half a furrow's length and then returned and plowed a [further] half, or similarly [if he plowed] to the side, he makes a bet peras. 
b) If he plowed a full furrow's length and then returned and plowed from that point beyond, he does not make this a bet peras.  

Explanation
Section one: If a person comes up against an obstacle when plowing, the obstacle will shake any bones off of the plow. The same is true if he shakes out the plowshare. Therefore, even if he has only plowed a little bit, he will not make a bet peras at any point further than this.
Section two: According to Rabbi Eliezer, if one plows a bet peras and then continues on, even well beyond a hundred cubits from where the original grave was located, the second field is also a bet peras. In other words, just as plowing a burial ground makes a bet peras, so too plowing a bet peras can make a new bet peras. 
Section three: Rabbi Joshua says that sometimes plowing a bet peras makes a new one, but sometimes it does not. It all depends on whether the second field is more than fifty cubits beyond the first.
In the first set of cases he plows for less than the 100 cubits and then goes back and plows that area again, either in a different direction or in the same direction but further than his first plowing. Since in his first plowing he didn't reach the 100 cubit limit in which a bet peras is formed, he makes a new bet peras. 
However, if he plows a full 100 cubits and then continues to plow from that point and onward, he doesn't make a new bet peras.
