Zevahim, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Our mishnah returns to the discussion of what sacrifices take precedence over other sacrifices.

Mishnah Five
1) Just as they take precedence in being offered, so they take precedence in being eaten.   
2) Yesterday’s shelamim and today’s shelamim, yesterday’s takes precedence. 
3) Yesterday’s shelamim and today’s hatat and asham, yesterday's shelamim takes precedence, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
a) But the sages say: the hatat takes precedence, because it is a most sacred sacrifice.

Explanation
Section one: Until now our chapter of mishnah has been discussing precedence with regard to sacrificing an animal (or meal-offering). Now the mishnah adds that if someone has two or more sacrifices to eat, the rules of precedence continue to apply. The hatat precedes the asham, the asham precedes the todah, etc.
Section two: A shelamim can be eaten the day it is sacrificed, the following night and the following day. Since yesterday’s shelamim must be eaten before the day is over, it takes precedence over today’s shelamim, which has longer in which to be eaten. 
Section three: Yesterday’s shelamim must be eaten by the end of the day, whereas the hatat and the asham that were offered today can be eaten today and tonight. To Rabbi Meir, the fact that the shelamim must be eaten earlier than the hatat or asham means that it takes precedence, despite the general rule that the asham and hatat take precedence over the shelamim. 
The sages rule that today’s hatat takes precedence over yesterday’s shelamim, and the same would hold true for today’s asham. Since they are most holy sacrifices their innate holiness overrides any consideration of how much longer the sacrifice can be eaten.
