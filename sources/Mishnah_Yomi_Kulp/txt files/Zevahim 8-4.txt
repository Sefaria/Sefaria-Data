Zevahim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four 
1) Limbs of a hatat which were mixed up with limbs from an olah: 
a) Rabbi Eliezer says: he must place [them all] on the top [of the altar], and regard the flesh of the hatat on top as though it were wood.   
b) But the sages say: they must become disfigured, and then go out to the place of burning.  

Explanation
In this mishnah a hatat and an olah have been slaughtered and cut up and then the limbs of the two animals get mixed up. As a reminder, a hatat can be eaten by male priests while an olah is completely burned on the altar. The problem is that the limbs cannot be eaten, because of the olah. The debate is over whether the hatat can be burned with the olah meat. 
Rabbi Eliezer says that he can burn the hatat flesh as long as his intent is not to “turn it into smoke” as is done with sacrifices, but rather to burn it as if it was wood.
The other rabbis say that this is not possible. Rather they must leave all the meat until the following morning, when it becomes “disfigured” by being left over. At this point it becomes remnant and it must be burned as is always the rule with remnant sacrifices.
