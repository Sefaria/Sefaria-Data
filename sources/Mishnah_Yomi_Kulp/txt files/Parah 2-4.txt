Parah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Today's mishnah teaches that if something rests upon the red cow it only disqualifies it from use as a hatat if it is done according to the owners wishes. 

Mishnah Four
1) If a bird rested on it, it remains valid. 
2) If a male beast mounted it, it becomes invalid. 
a) Rabbi Judah says: if the male was made to mount, it becomes invalid; but if it did so of itself, it remains valid.

Explanation
Section one: A bird sitting on the red cow does not disqualify it from use as a hatat. This does not count as the bird having performed work for it was not something that the owners wanted to happen. 
Section two: According to the first opinion, if a male animal mounts the red cow to mate with it the red cow has been invalidated because this is something that the owners would want to happen. And although they would not want it to happen to that particular cow, for this would invalidate it for use as a red cow hatat (worth lots of cash), since they would want it to happen to their other cows, this counts as something that was done with the consent of the owners. 
Rabbi Judah distinguishes between a case where the owners caused the male to mount the red cow and cases where the bull mounted on its own. For this act to be considered something done according to the owners' wishes, they must take an active part in the act. If they do not, then we cannot consider it an act that disqualifies the red cow.
