Meilah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Today’s mishnah deals with the showbread that is placed on the table in the Sanctuary every Shabbat. 

Mishnah Seven
1) The law of sacrilege applies to the showbread from the moment of its dedication. 
2) Once it has formed a crust in the oven it becomes susceptible to be disqualified through contact with a tevul yom or one who still requires atonement, and it may be arranged upon the table [of the Sanctuary]. 
3) Once the dishes of incense have been offered it is subject to [the laws of] piggul, notar and defilement, and the law of sacrilege no longer applies to it.

Explanation
Section one: See above mishnayot. 
Section two: As with the two loaves in yesterday’s mishnah, the showbread can become disqualified once it has become crusted. It is also at this point that it can be taken out of the oven and arranged on the table.
Section three: Two dishes of incense were placed over the showbread. If the bread was “piggul”— while he was burning the incense he had the intent of eating the bread on the next day—he would be liable for eating it. Similarly, if he waited until it was remnant (notar) or ate it after it was defiled he would be liable. As is always the case, once the bread has become defiled, it is no longer subject to the law of sacrilege.
