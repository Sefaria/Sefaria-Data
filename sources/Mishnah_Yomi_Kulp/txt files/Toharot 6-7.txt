Toharot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
1) A valley: in summer time  is a private domain in respect of the laws of Shabbat, but as a public domain in respect of those of uncleanness; 
2) And in the rainy season it is regarded as a private domain in both respects. 

Explanation
Section one: In the summer there are more people in the valley working the fields. Therefore, for matters of uncleanness it is considered a public domain. When it comes to Shabbat it is still a private domain, or, as we explained in yesterday's mishnah, at least not a public domain. 
Section two: In the rainy season people can't work the land in the valleys. Therefore, it is not considered a public domain for either purpose.
