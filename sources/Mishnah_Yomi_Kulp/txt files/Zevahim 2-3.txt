Zevahim, Chapter Two, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
1) This is the general rule: anyone who slaughters or receives [the blood], or carries [it] or sprinkles [it] [intending] to eat as much as an olive of that which is normally eaten or to burn [on the altar] as much as an olive of that which is normally burned outside its prescribed place, [the sacrifice] is invalid, but it does not involve karet; 
a) [Intending to eat or burn] after its designated time, it is piggul and it involves karet.
2) Provided that the mattir is offered in accordance with the law.  

Explanation
Section one: This is the general rule that explains the details in mishnah two. If while performing one of the four essential activities he had the intent to eat or burn part of the sacrifice outside of the place where it must be eaten or burned, the sacrifice is invalid, but one who eats it is not punished by karet. This is not the “piggul” referred to in the Torah.
In contrast, if the priest has the intent of eating or burning its innards on the altar after the time in which it must be eaten or burned, the sacrifice is “piggul” and one who eats of it is liable for karet, as we explained in yesterday’s mishnah. 
Section two: The sprinkling of the blood onto the altar is what permits the sacrifice to be eaten. The word for “permit” in Hebrew is “mattir” so the blood is called the “mattir.” This section teaches that for the previous halakhot to hold true, the blood must have been properly sprinkled on the altar. This will be explained more fully in tomorrow’s mishnah.
