1) If one gave a loan and took a pledge he is accounted a paid guardian.
a) Rabbi Judah says:  “If he lent him money he is accounted an unpaid guardian; if he lent him produce he is accounted a paid guardian.”
2) Abba Shaul, “One may hire out a poor man’s pledge and thereby reduce the debt, for in such a way he is like one who returns lost property.”

Explanation—Mishnah Seven
Section one:  If one gave a loan to another person and took from that person a pledge to guarantee the loan, the lender is considered to be a paid guardian vis a vis the pledge.  Since by keeping the pledge he is getting in return a guarantee on his loan he has the added liability of being a paid guardian.  Rabbi Judah refines this law.  According to Rabbi Judah one who loans money is accounted an unpaid guardian over a pledge.  Since Jews cannot lend other Jews with interest, lending money is a total favor to the borrower.  Therefore, in compensation, the lender has less liability over the pledge.  However, one who lends produce actually benefits by lending it, since the produce may have gone bad while in his possession.  Since he receives benefit he is a paid guardian over the pledge.  
Section two:  Abba Shaul states that if a lender takes a pledge from a poor person he should rent out the pledge and keep the money in order to gradually reduce the amount of the pledge.  In this way he is able to return the pledge to the poor person without the poor person actually having to pay back his loan.
