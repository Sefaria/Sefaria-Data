Orlah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Introduction
In this mishnah we learn that if terumah and orlah are mixed in together, each counts with regard to creating the necessary ratio for the other to be voided. 

Mishnah Two
1) Terumah can void orlah, and orlah can void terumah. 
2) How so? 
a) [For instance] a seah of terumah fell into one hundred, and afterwards three kavs of orlah or three kavs of mixed-seeds of the vineyard [fell in]. This is [an instance] where terumah goes towards neutralizing orlah, and orlah terumah.

Explanation
Section one: If terumah and hullin are mixed in together, they can join together to create the necessary 200 to 1 ratio in order to neutralize any orlah or kilayim that are in the mixture. Similarly, orlah can join together with hullin to create the necessary 100 to one ratio to neutralize terumah.
Section two: The mishnah now illustrates how this works. If a seah of terumah falls into one hundred (actually ninety-nine) of hullin, and then three kavs, which is half a seah, of orlah or kilayim (mixed-seeds) fall in, the orlah or kilayim is neutralized. If we count the terumah with the hullin then there is a 200 to one ratio to neutralize the orlah or kilayim. Similarly, if a seah of orlah is mixed up with 200 seahs of hullin, and then terumah fell into the mixture, if the orlah and hullin are more than 100 to 1 of the terumah, the terumah is neutralized.
