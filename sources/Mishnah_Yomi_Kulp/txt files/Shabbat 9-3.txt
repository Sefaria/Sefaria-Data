Shabbat, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Three

Mishnah Three
1) How do we know that if one [a woman] discharges semen on the third day she is unclean? 
a) Because it is said, “Be ready for the third day” (Exodus 19:15).  
2) How do we know that one who has been circumcised may be bathed on the third day [after circumcision] which falls on Shabbat? 
a) Because it is said, “And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain” (Genesis 34:25).  
3) How do we know that a crimson-colored strap is tied to the head of the goat that is sent [to Azazel]?  
a) Because it is said, “If your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow” (Isaiah 1:18).

Explanation
Section one:  Semen imparts ritual impurity. A woman who discharges semen up until three days after having intercourse is made unclean by this semen.  This is why Moses told the people of Israel not to have intercourse for three days before receiving the Torah.  If the woman would have a discharge of semen after the third day, the semen would no longer transmit impurity.
Section two:  It is permitted to warm water (but not to light a fire) in order to bathe someone who has just been circumcised.  The mishnah assumes that we know that it is permitted to do so on the first and second days after the circumcision.  It is permitted up until the third day. This is derived from what it says about the people of Shechem who were still in pain three days after their circumcision.   
Section three:  According to rabbinic sources, (see Yoma 6:6) the priests would tie a crimson ribbon to the horns of the goat sent to Azazel on Yom Kippur. If the ribbon turned white, it was a sign that the children of Israel’s sins had been forgiven.  This is connected in our mishnah to the verse from Isaiah.
