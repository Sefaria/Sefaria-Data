
Mishnah Three
1) If a man sold a field, and the buyer gave him part of the price and he said to the buyer, “Pay me the rest of the price whenever you wish and then take what is yours”, this is forbidden.
2) If a man lent another money on the security of his field and said to him, “If you do not pay me within three years it will be mine”, then it becomes his.  
a) This is what Boethus the son of Zunin used to do with the consent of the Sages.

Explanation
Section one:  The scenario described in this case is forbidden because the seller gets the use and benefit from the field in return for allowing a delayed payment from the buyer.  In other words the buyer in essence loans the seller the field in return for waiting until he can gather the remainder of the money to complete the sale.  This is usury. 
Section two:  A person may loan another person money and use the other person’s field as collateral.  Even though this may look as if the borrower is selling him his field in return for the loan, the Sages did not consider this to be usury.

Questions for Further Thought:
Mishnah three, section one:  Would it be forbidden for Reuven to sell a field to Shimon and for Reuven to continue to use the field until Shimon brought him the money?
