Meilah, Chapter One, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Today’s mishnah deals with the innards of sacrifices of a lower degree of holiness. These innards are burned on the altar after the blood has been spilled. As in yesterday’s mishnah, today we discuss a case where these innards left the Temple courtyard. This disqualifies them from being able to be placed on the altar.  
As in yesterday’s mishnah, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi disagree about whether the laws of sacrilege apply. Their opinions are consistent with those found in yesterday’s mishnah. 

Mishnah Three
If the innards of sacrifices of that have a lower degree of holiness were taken out [of the Temple court] before the blood was sprinkled: 
1) Rabbi Eliezer says: they are not subject to the laws of sacrilege and one cannot become guilty of [transgressing with them the laws of] notar, piggul and defilement. 
2) Rabbi Akiva says: they are subject to the laws of sacrilege and one can become guilty of [transgressing with them the laws of] notar, piggul and defilement.

Explanation
Section one: Rabbi Eliezer holds that when it comes to the rules of sacrilege, the same rules that applied in yesterday’s mishnah to the flesh of most holy sacrifices, apply to the innards of less holy sacrifices. Once they were taken out of the Temple, they became disqualified from being subsequently placed on the altar. The laws of sacrilege therefore do apply, even after the blood was spilled. The other laws do not apply because this flesh was never able to have been placed on the altar. 
Section two: Rabbi Akiva holds that even though the innards were removed from the Temple before the blood was sprinkled, the sprinkling does make them subject to the laws of sacrilege, the same as it did for the flesh in yesterday’s mishnah.
