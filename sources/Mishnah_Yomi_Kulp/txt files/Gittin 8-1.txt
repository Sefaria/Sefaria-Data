Gittin, Chapter Eight, Mishnah One

Introduction
The first three mishnayoth of this chapter discuss a husband who throws his get to his wife.  While a woman need not consent to being divorced, the husband must deliver the get into her possession and make her aware of the fact that she is being divorced.  These mishnayoth define what it takes to fulfill these two requirements. 

Mishnah One
1) If a husband throws a get to his wife, and she is in her house or in her courtyard, she is divorced. 
2) If he throws it to her in his house or in his courtyard, even though it is with her on the same bed, she is not divorced. 
3) If he throws it into her lap or into her basket, she is divorced.

Explanation
Section one:  The Torah states that the husband “puts the get in her hand” (Deuteronomy 24:1).  The rabbis expand this requirement and allow the husband to put the get into any place which is in her possession.
Section two:  In this case, she is on his property and hence he cannot just throw the get at her.  This is true even if the husband puts the get into her bed, if the bed belongs to the husband, she is not divorced.
Section three:  If he puts the get into her lap or into her basket she is divorced.  This is true even if she is standing on his property.  Since her lap and basket belong to her, it is sufficient if he delivers the get to one of these places.
