Sheviit, Chapter Five, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah and the next three mishnayot all deal with the “luf,” a type of onion. The practice was to store the luf underground in order to preserve it. The problem on Sheviit is that this might look like planting, which is forbidden on sheviit.

Mishnah Two
One who buries luf (a type of onion) in the soil during the sabbatical year: 
1) Rabbi Meir says: it must be not less than two seahs in quantity, three handbreadths in height, and covered with earth one handbreadth deep.  
2) The sages say: it must be not less than four kabs in quantity, one handbreadth high, and covered with earth one handbreadth deep. 
3) And he should bury it in a place where people walk.

Explanation
Section one:   According to Rabbi Meir, he needs to bury at least two seahs worth of luf-onions (=12 kab). The heap of luf that he is going to bury must be at least three handbreadths high and he must cover it with at least one handbreadth deep of soil. If he fulfills these three conditions, then he can bury the luf without it looking like he is planting it, because no one would plant in such a manner.
Section two: The sages rule more leniently than does Rabbi Meir. The quantity of luf that must be buried can be lower and the heap need not be as large. However, they agree that it must be covered with earth at least one handbreadth deep.
Section three: In order to prevent the luf from sprouting and growing they should plant it in a place where people walk. This would also seem to serve well in distinguishing between storing and planting—one does not plant in a place where people will trample the plants.
