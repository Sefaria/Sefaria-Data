Negaim, Chapter Thirteen, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Today's mishnah deals with the impurity of the afflicted house.

Mishnah Four
1) A house that has been isolated conveys uncleanness from its inside;   
2) And one that has been certified unclean, both from its inside and from its outside.
3) Both convey uncleanness  if one enters in.

Explanation
Section one: Someone who touches the inside of a house that has been isolated is impure, even if he doesn't go into the house. However, if he touches the outside, he remains pure.
Section two: A house which is certified unclean also conveys uncleanness from its outside.
Section three: In both cases, if one enters the house he is unclean, even if he doesn't touch the walls of the house (see Leviticus 14:46).
