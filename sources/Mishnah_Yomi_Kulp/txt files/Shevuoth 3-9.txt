Shevuoth, Chapter Three, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
Mishnah nine discusses one who takes two oaths, the second oath being the exact opposite of the first oath.


Mishnah Nine
1) [If one said:] “I swear I shall eat this loaf”; [and then he said,] “I swear I shall not eat it,” the first is an oath of utterance,  and the second is a vain oath.   
a) If he ate it, he transgressed the vain oath; if he did not eat it, he transgressed the oath of utterance.

Explanation
In the case in our mishnah a person swears two oaths, the second oath contradicting the first.  The first oath is considered to be a normal oath of utterance, which he must observe or be liable for breaking his oath.  The second oath is considered a vain oath, since it is forbidden to observe the oath.  In other words, similar to one who swears not to observe a commandment, this person has sworn to do that which is forbidden for him to do.
If he eats the loaf, as he swore to do in the first oath, he is liable for having broken the second oath.  If he does not eat it, he is liable for having broken his oath of utterance.  In the Talmud it is explained that if he does not eat the loaf he has transgressed not only his oath of utterance but he has also made a vain oath, despite the fact that he kept the oath.  Since at the time that he made the oath it was forbidden to keep, he is liable for having made a vain oath even if he does keep it.
