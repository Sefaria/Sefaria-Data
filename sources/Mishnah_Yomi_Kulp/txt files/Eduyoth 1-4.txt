Introduction

Mishnah Four 
1) And why do they record the opinions of Shammai and Hillel for naught?
a) To teach the following generations that a man should not [always] persist in his opinion, for behold, the fathers of the world did not persist in their opinion.

Explanation
This mishnah, and the two mishnayoth which we will learn tomorrow ask deep questions about the nature of the Mishnah in its totality.  In the previous two mishnayoth we learned statements of Shammai and Hillel that were not accepted as normative law.  Indeed, throughout this year of learning we have read and discussed many statements that are not law in our days, nor in the days in which those statements were recited.  Why then does the Mishnah record and do we continue to learn these statements?  One answer, the answer that our mishnah provides, is to teach that just as Shammai and Hillel compromised and changed their minds when they saw they were contradicted, and they were the “fathers of the world”, the founders of Rabbinic Judaism, all the more so should lesser people change their mind when they realize that they may be wrong.  The mishnah then becomes a lesson not in argumentation, but in compromise and unity.  The mishnah records minority opinions to show that even great teachers change their mind when wrong.  We will learn other reasons tomorrow.
