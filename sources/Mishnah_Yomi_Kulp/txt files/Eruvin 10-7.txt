Eruvin, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Seven

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with drawing water from a nearby cistern into a house or pouring water out from a house into a nearby garbage heap.  In both cases this is allowed so long as both areas are private domains.    

Mishnah Seven
1) If a cistern in a public domain had an embankment ten handbreadths high, it is permitted to draw water from it on the sabbath through a window above it. 
2) If a garbage heap in a public domain was ten handbreadths high, it is permitted to pour water on it on Shabbat from a window above it.

Explanation
Section one:  Around a cistern they would make a rim of earth.  If this rim was higher than ten handbreadths, then it and all of the area from the ground and above is considered to be a private domain.  The window is also a private domain and therefore, one could draw water from the cistern through the window. 
Section two:  This is basically the same situation as in the previous section.  If the garbage heap is ten handbreadths high then it is a private domain, and again he is taking something (the water) from one private domain and pouring it into another private domain.
