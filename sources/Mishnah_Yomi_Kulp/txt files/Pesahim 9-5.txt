Pesahim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Five

Introduction
There are certain requirements for offering the pesah sacrifice which were only mandated during the first pesah, that which was observed on the night on which the Israelites left Egypt.  These requirements were not observed in subsequent years.  Our mishnah lists some of the differences between this first pesah and that offered and obligatory for the generations that followed.
 
Mishnah Five
What is the difference between the pesah [which was offered] in Egypt and the pesah of [subsequent] generations? 
1) The pesah in Egypt was taken on the tenth [of Nisan], 
2) And it required sprinkling with a bunch of hyssop on the lintel and on the two door-posts, 
3) And it was eaten in haste on one night, whereas the pesah of [subsequent] generations is kept the whole seven [days].

Explanation
Section one:  The first lamb or kid which was to be used for the first pesah was separated out of the flock by the Israelites on the tenth of Nisan (Exodus 12:3).  This early separation was only required for that year.
Section two:  The Israelites were required to apply the blood of the pesah on the lintel and two door-posts, using a bunch of hyssop (zatar in Arabic—still commonly used in the Middle East) as a sort of paintbrush (v. 22).  In subsequent years this was not done. 
Section three:  The original pesah was to be eaten in haste (v. 11).  It was only eaten on one night.  This last statement is somewhat puzzling because in subsequent years the same was true—the pesah was eaten for only one night.  The Talmud therefore adds here that in Egypt the prohibition of chametz was only for one night.  In subsequent years the prohibition of chametz was observed for a full seven days (v. 8).
