Arakhin, Chapter Five, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah deals with someone who dedicates half of his worth or value.

Mishnah Three
1) [If one said:] “Half my value is upon me,” he must pay half his evaluation.
2) [But if he said,] “The value of one half of me he is upon me,” he must pay his full value. 
3) [If he said] “Half of my worth is upon me,” he must pay half his worth. 
4) [If he said,] “The worth of half of me is upon me,” he must pay his whole worth. 
5) This is the general rule: Anything on which his life depends, he must pay his whole worth.

Explanation
Section one: In this case, he pays half of his value, which is what he intended when he made his vow.
Section two: Here he phrased his vow slightly differently. Saying “the value of one half of me is upon me,” is like saying “the value of my head is upon me” because no one can live without half of his body. Therefore, as we learned in yesterday’s mishnah, he must pay his full value.
Section three: Similar to section one, in this case he pays only half of his worth.
Section four: Although one can estimate how much a slave missing a hand would be worth, there is no way to estimate how much a slave missing half his body would be worth, because he would be worth nothing. Therefore, the worth of half of his body is synonymous with the worth of his whole body and he must pay his entire worth.  
Section five: This is a similar rule to that which we saw in mishnah two concerning vows of value. If someone vows the worth of a body part that he can’t live without, he must pay his entire worth.
