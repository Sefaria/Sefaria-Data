Peah, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with poor man’s tithe, the tithe given to the poor in the third and sixth year of a sabbatical cycle.  As we have seen above, there is a difference between poor man’s tithe and the other agricultural gifts.  Whereas the other agricultural gifts (peah, leket, forgotten sheaves etc.) are collected by the poor themselves, the field owner gives poor man’s tithe directly to the poor.  Our mishnah instructs how much of the poor man’s tithe the owner should give to each poor person.  He doesn’t just give all of his tithes to the first poor person that he sees. Rather he gives a minimum amount to each poor person who comes his way—this way there will be tithes left over for others who come later.
The mishnah itself should be easily understood and hence I have refrained from commenting below.
