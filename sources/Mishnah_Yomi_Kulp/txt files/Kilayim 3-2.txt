Kilayim, Chapter Three, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah is a direct continuation of yesterday’s mishnah.

Mishnah Two
1) They may not sow different species of seeds in one bed, but they may sow different species of vegetables in one bed.   
2) Mustard and small polished peas are a species of seed; large peas are a species of vegetable.
3) If a border was originally a handbreadth high and then it fell in height, it remains valid,   since it was valid at the beginning.  
4) A furrow or water channel which are a handbreadth deep, it is permitted to sow three different species of vegetables, one on one side, one on the other side, and one in the middle. 

Explanation
Section one:  In yesterday’s mishnah we learned that in some cases it is permitted to plant five different species in one furrow, six handbreadths by six handbreadths.  Our mishnah says that this refers only to vegetables, because it is customary to plant small patches of vegetables.  However, it does not apply to seeds, because it is customary to plant them in larger areas, and therefore planting many seeds in one small patch is forbidden because it looks too much like kilayim.
Section two:  The mishnah identifies mustard and a certain small species of peas as being species of seeds, whereas it identifies larger peas as being a species of vegetable.
Section three: If the border wall was originally high enough to plant on top of it twelve species and then it started to deteriorate, he does not have to uproot all of the seeds which he planted there, since he planted them with permission.
Section four:  If there is a furrow or water channel that is one handbreadth deep he can plant one species on each side of the furrow, and one species in the middle, because the depth is considered a separation.
