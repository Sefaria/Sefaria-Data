Bekhorot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah One

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with various defects concerning the hair on one’s head.

Mishnah One
1) A bald-headed person is unfit [for the priesthood]. 
a) What is considered bald-headed? One who does not have a line of hair from ear to ear. 
b) If he has one, then he is fit.
2) One who has no eyebrows or has only one eyebrow [is unfit], this being the gibben mentioned in the Torah.   
a) Rabbi Dosa says: one whose eyebrows lie flat [overshadowing the eyes]. 
b) Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: one who has a double back or a double spine. 

Explanation
Section one: One who is bald cannot serve in the Temple. However, this is limited to one who is really bald, a man who doesn’t even have a line of hair from one ear to the other. Those, like me, who are bald but have a little bit of hair, can, thankfully, fulfill their role as priests (now if only my father was a kohnen..).
Section two: In the chapter dealing with the blemishes of the priest, the Torah lists the “gibben” (Leviticus 21:20). The rabbis debate what this word means. According to the first opinion, a “gibben” has a problem with his eyebrows. He either has no eyebrows, or only one. 
Rabbi Dosa says that the problem is slightly different—his eyebrows are long and hang over his eyes. 
Rabbi Hanina believes that the problem has nothing to do with eyebrows, but rather with the back. The person looks as if he has two backs or two spines.
