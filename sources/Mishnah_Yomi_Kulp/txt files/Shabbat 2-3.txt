Shabbat, Chapter Two, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah returns to discussing what may be used as wicks for Shabbat lights.

Mishnah Three
1)   Whatever comes from a tree they may not light [the Shabbat light] except for flax. 
2)   And whatever comes from a tree cannot be defiled with tent-uncleanness except linen.  
3)   A wick made of cloth which was twisted but not singed:
i) Rabbi Eliezer says: it is unclean, and one may not light with it; 
ii) Rabbi Akiva says: it is clean and one may light with it.

Explanation
Section one:  The only type of material which comes from a tree which may be used as a wick is flax, which is used to make linen.  Although we would not consider flax to be a tree, it is called a tree in Joshua 2:6.
Section two: There is a connection between what type of material can be used as a Shabbat candle wick and what type of material contracts tent-uncleanness.  If a corpse or piece thereof is under a tent and something else is under the tent is well, the corpse transmits its impurity to the other thing under the tent.  Any type of material except linen which covers both the corpse and the other thing will carry the impurity but it itself will remain pure.  A tent made of linen not only causes the impurity to go from the corpse to the other thing but it itself becomes impure.
Section three:  They would make wicks by twisting cloth and then singing them.  Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiba debate the status of twisted cloth that has not been singed. According to Rabbi Eliezer it is still considered to be a cloth and hence it can still receive impurities. Since it has not been singed it should not however be used as a wick.  Rabbi Akiva holds that since it has been twisted it is no longer considered cloth, but even though it has not been singed one may light with it.
