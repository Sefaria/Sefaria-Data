Mishnah Seven

a) So to wild animals and birds.
b) If so, why is it written “an ox or an ass”?
c) But Scripture spoke of prevailing conditions.

Explanation

Mishnah seven lists several laws in which the Torah states “ox” or “beast” but the Rabbis hold that the law is true for all animals, including even wild animals and birds.  I will briefly explain these laws with their Biblical references:
Falling into the pit—this is our topic in Bava Kamma.
Keeping apart from Mount Sinai—see Exodus 19:13. There God tells Moses to keep everyone, including the animals away from the mountain before the Revelation. 
Two-fold restitution—see Exodus 22:3, 8.  If a person steals something and is caught he must pay back double.
Restoring lost property—see Exodus 23:4, and Deuteronomy 22:1.
Unloading—see Exodus 23:5.  If one sees his enemy’s ox buckling under its load, he must help him unload the animal.
Muzzling—see Deuteronomy 25:4.  One is not allowed to muzzle an ox while it is threshing.  
Diverse kinds—see Leviticus 19:19 and Deuteronomy 22:10.  According to Leviticus one is not allowed to mate two different kinds of animals.  According to Deuteronomy one is not allowed to yoke an ox and an ass together. 
The Sabbath—see Exodus 20:10 and Deuteronomy 5:14.  One must allow his animals to rest on the Sabbath.

According to our mishnah the reason why the Torah uses the word ox is that oxen were the most frequently used animals in those times.
