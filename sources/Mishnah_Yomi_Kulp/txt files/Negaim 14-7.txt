Negaim, Chapter Fourteen, Mishnah Seven

Mishnah Seven
1) On the eighth day he would bring three beasts: a sin-offering, a guilt-offering and a whole burnt-offering.
2) And a poor man would bring a sin-offering of a bird and a burnt-offering of a bird. 

Explanation
Section one: These are the sacrifices clearly outlined in Leviticus 14:10ff. The first section refers to the standard offering. A person who is not poor would bring two lambs and one ewe.
Section two: The Torah states that a poor person can bring a sin-offering and a burnt-offering of a bird. The guilt-offering must still be a lamb.
