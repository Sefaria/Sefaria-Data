Ketuboth, Chapter Thirteen, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
Another dispute between the Sages and Admon.

Mishnah Seven
If a man went to a country beyond the sea and [in his absence] the path to his field was lost, Admon ruled: let him walk [to his field] by the shortest way.   
But the Sages say: let him purchase a path for himself even if it costs him a hundred maneh or let him fly through the air.

Explanation
A man owns a path that goes to his field through other fields. When the man returns from having gone abroad, the path has been overgrown (for no one was there to take care of it) and it is no longer distinguishable from the remainder of the field.  Admon says that he may walk through the shortest path available to get to his field.  The owner of the field through which he walks must allow him to use this ground.  However, he can only take the shortest path, since that is the least damaging.
The Sages say that he must purchase a path from the owner of the field through which he wants to walk, even if that owner will only sell it to him for a hundred maneh (10,000 zuz, an exaggerated amount).  His only alternative is to fly through the air to get to his field.
