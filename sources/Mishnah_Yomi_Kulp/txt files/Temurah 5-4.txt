Temurah, Chapter Five, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Today’s mishnah contains a debate between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yose that is very similar to the debate found in yesterday’s mishnah. 

Mishnah Four
1) [If one says:] “Behold, this animal shall be the substitute of an olah and the substitute of a shelamim,” it is the substitute of an olah, the words of Rabbi Meir.   
2) Rabbi Yose says: if he originally intended this, since it is impossible to mention both names [of sacrifices] simultaneously, his words stand.   
a) But if after he had already said: “This shall be the substitute of an olah,” he changed his mind and then said: “The substitute of a shelamim,” it is the substitute of an olah.

Explanation
Section one: Again in this situation a person said two things that are contradictory. One animal cannot be a substitute for both an olah and a shelamim. According to Rabbi Meir, we take into consideration only his first words, and the animal is the substitute of an olah, and not the substitute of a shelamim. 
Section two: Rabbi Yose says that if he intended to make the animal both the substitute of a shelamim and the substitute of an olah, his words count. Such an animal is half a substitute for an olah and half for a shelamim. Obviously it cannot be sacrificed; rather it must be let out to pasture until it is blemished, then sold and with half of the proceeds he brings an olah and with the other half he brings a shelamim.
If, however, he said one thing and then changed his mind, his first words count. Once one has dedicated an animal or made it into a substitute, he cannot subsequently change his mind.
