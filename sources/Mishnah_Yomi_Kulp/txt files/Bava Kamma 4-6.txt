Mishnah Six
1) If an ox was rubbing itself against a wall and it fell on a person; 
2) or if it intended to kill an animal and it killed a man;
3) or if it intended to kill a gentile and it killed an Israelite;
4) or if it intended to kill an untimely birth and it killed a viable infant,
5) it is exempt [from death by stoning].

Explanation

Mishnah six deals with several instances in which an ox that kills another Jewish human being but unintentionally.  In section one the ox was only scratching its back and certainly had no intention to kill.  In section two the ox did have intention to kill but its intention was to kill an animal. In section three the ox did have the intention to kill a human being, but its intention was directed at killing a gentile.  According to the mishnah an ox that kills a gentile will not be judged in the same way as an ox that kills a Jew.  (With regards to Jewish-gentile relations see the discussion on chapter four mishnah three.)  In section four the ox did have intention to kill a Jewish human being, but that Jewish human being would not have been able to live.  (According to the Rabbis understanding of medicine a child born after eight months could not survive).  In all of these cases since the intention was to kill something for which the ox would not be liable for the death penalty the ox is exempt from the death penalty.  In other words we judge the ox by its intention and not by its actions.
