Megillah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Five

Introduction
One can fulfill one’s obligation of hearing the Megillah at any time during the day. Our mishnah gives a very long list of numerous other rituals that one can perform at any time during the day.
Since this list is very long, I will not explain each item in detail, but rather mostly make reference to the relevant biblical verse(s) which deal with the issue.  I will not even comment on issues that seem abundantly clear.

1) reading the Megillah;
2) reciting Hallel; 
3) for the blowing of the shofar; 
4) for taking up the lulav;

6) for Musaf sacrifices;   
7) for confession over the oxen;

9) for the confession of sins on Yom HaKippurim;
