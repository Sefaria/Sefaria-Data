Mikvaot, Chapter One, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Today's mishnah is basically a repeat of mishnayot 1-3 except here we deal with rainwater that continues to flow into the pool. This rain will continuously nullify the water that has been defiled and put back into the pool. Thus, this water cannot become impure (although water taken out of it can be made impure).
The commentary to this mishnah would be the same as that found in mishnayot 1-3 so I have not repeated it from there. Section two is parallel to mishnah one, section three is parallel to mishnah two, and section four is parallel to mishnah three. Section five is similar to the end of yesterday's mishnah. It notes that this water is pure enough that it can be used in the preparation of terumah.
