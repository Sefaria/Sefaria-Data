Temurah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Today’s mishnah deals with the offspring and substitutes of a todah (thanksgiving offering) or of an olah (whole burnt offering).

Mishnah Two
1) The offspring of a todah and its substitute, their offspring and the offspring of their offspring, until the end of all time, are considered as a todah, only they do not require the accompaniment of loaves of bread.  
2) The substitute of an olah, the offspring of its substitute, its offspring and the offspring of its offspring, until the end of time, are regarded as an olah: they require flaying, cutting into pieces and to be altogether burned.

Explanation
Section one: Basically, the animals whose holiness comes about as a result of a todah (offspring, and their offspring) have the status of a todah. The one difference is that the original todah is brought with a bread offering, whereas the offspring is brought without a bread offering. This law was derived midrashically in Menahot 7:4.
Section two: The substitute of an olah is a case where a person substituted a male animal for an olah. If one substitutes a female for the male olah, then the female is holy, and its offspring is sacrificed as an olah. But the olah itself does not have halakhic offspring, because the olah is a male. All of the offspring in this section, therefore, refer to a case where a female was substituted for a male. 
These offspring must all be flayed, cut into pieces and then burned on the altar. These laws are outlined in the first chapter of Leviticus.
