Ohalot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
The following protect [against impurity] but do not bring it: 
A loom [with the woof] spread out, the ropes of a bed, waste baskets, and window-lattices.

Explanation
The items listed in this mishnah can act as a barrier against. For instance if one of them covers the hatch between a bottom floor and an upper story, the contents of the upper story are protected. But they don't bring impurity if they overshadow both a piece of corpse and vessels.
The loom has the warp spread out over it, but it can't act as an ohel till it is fully woven.
The ropes of a bed are tied tight to support the mattress. 
The waste baskets have small holes in them, enough so that they can't act as an ohel.
