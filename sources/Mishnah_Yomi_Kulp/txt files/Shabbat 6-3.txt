Shabbat, Chapter Six, Mishnah Three

Introduction
The previous two mishnayot listed things which it was permitted according to Torah law to wear into the public domain but which the sages nevertheless prohibited for various reasons.  Today’s mishnah lists things which are prohibited even according to Torah law.   

Mishnah Three
1)   A woman may not go out with a needle that is pierced, 
2)   Nor with a ring bearing a signet, 
3)   Nor with a cochlea brooch, 
4)   Nor with a spice tie,   
5)   Nor with a perfume vial; 
a) And if she does go out, she is liable to a sin-offering, the words of Rabbi Meir.
b) But the sages say that she is not liable in the case of a spice tie and a perfume vial.

Explanation
Section one:  A pierced needle is one which is used for sewing, an activity which is prohibited on Shabbat.  Therefore it is prohibited from the Torah for a woman (or a man, for that matter) to go out carrying one on Shabbat.
Section two:  A ring with a signet is for signing, which is prohibited from the Torah on Shabbat.  
Section three:  This is a type of crown not commonly worn. Since it is not common attire, carrying it is considered “carrying” and not “wearing.”
Sections 4-5:  Spice ties and perfume vials are only worn by women with extraordinarily bad smells.  Rabbi Meir says that since most women don’t wear these things, they are considered “carrying” and hence prohibited by the Torah.  The sages disagree and hold that the spice tie and perfume vial are not really carrying and hence there is only a rabbinic prohibition to carry them into the public domain.
