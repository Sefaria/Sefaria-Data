Ohalot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our mishnah continues to list things that both serve as a barrier against impurity and bring impurity. 

Mishnah Two
1) Projections from a wall, balconies,   dovecotes, crevices and crags, grottoes,   [overhanging] pinnacles, interlaced boughs and protruding stones as long as they are cable of sustaining thin plasterwork, the words of Rabbi Meir. 
2) But the sages say a medium plasterwork. 
3) What are interlaced boughs? A tree which casts shade over the ground. 
a) Protruding stones? [Stones] that project from a wall. 

Explanation
Section one: These are mostly naturally formed protrusions that either jut out from walls or are carved into them.
Section two: According to Rabbi Meir, for the interlaced boughs and protruding stones to both bring impurity and protect against it, they must be close enough together such that if thin plaster was poured on top it would not drip through. 
Other commentators interpret  Rabbi Meir differently. Rabbi Meir holds that as long as the boughs and stones are strong enough to hold a thin layer of plasterwork, they can bring impurity and protect against it. 
Section three: Just as there were two interpretations of Rabbi Meir, there are two interpretations of the sages who disagree with him. According to the first interpretation, as long as the boughs and stones can prevent plaster-work of medium thickness from dripping through, they bring impurity and protect against it. 
According to the second interpretation, the stones and boughs must be strong enough to hold a medium layer of plasterwork to bring and protect against impurity. 
Section four: This section defines what interlaced boughs and protruding stones are.
