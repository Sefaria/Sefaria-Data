Ohalot, Chapter Two, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Our mishnah refers to some of the defiling agents that have been mentioned in other mishnayot in this chapter and notes that if these things do not have the prescribed measure, they are not impure at all. This is different from the skull and vertebrae that are still impure, even if they are not intact (see mishnah three). 
Most of the mishnah is self-explanatory, so I have only commented where necessary. 

Mishnah Five 
These are clean if they are deficient:  
1) An olive-sized [portion] of a corpse;
2) An olive-sized [portion] of nezel, 
3) A ladleful of corpse-mold, 
4) A quarter [of a log] of blood, 
5) A bone of the size of a barley-corn, 
6) And a limb [severed] from a living person, the bone of which [limb] is deficient.  

Explanation
Section two: On the meaning of "nezel" see 2:1.
Section six: If a limb is separated from a living person, and part of the bone itself is missing, the bone is pure, no matter the size. However, if part of the flesh is missing, it is still impure (see mishnah three). 
And if the limb came from a dead body, the bone is impure as long as there is an amount the size of a barley-corn, as we learn here and in mishnah three.
