Mikvaot, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Today's mishnah talks about when such types of stains block the successful immersion of vessels.

Mishnah Six
1) On clothing: if on one side [only] they do not block. 
a) But [if found] on two sides they do block. 
2) Rabbi Judah says in the name of Rabbi Ishmael: on one side also. 
3) Rabbi Yose says: in the case of builders they block if on one side, but in the case of the ditch-digger only if on both sides. 

Explanation
Section one: If the stain can be seen on only one side of the clothing, it does not block. But if the stain can be seen on both sides of the clothing then it is a deeper stain and it must be removed before the clothing can be successful immersed.
Section two: According to Rabbi Judah, even if the stain can only be seen on one side of the clothing, it blocks immersion. 
Section three:  Rabbi Yose says that when it comes to builders, their clothing cannot be immersed even if the stain can be seen only on one side . According to this interpretation (others interpret the mishnah to refer to bathhouse attendants), builders take care that their clothes shouldn't have any stains on them, and therefore they would wish to remove this stain. But ditch-diggers (this is the interpretation suggested by Albeck—others read "the uncultured") do not care if their clothing is stained on one side. Therefore, it blocks immersion only if the stain can be seen on both sides.
