Orlah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Fourteen

Introduction
This mishnah deals with leaven of terumah and leaven of kilayim which fell into dough. Neither piece of leaven is sufficient to cause fermentation, but together they cause fermentation. According to the rabbis’ opinion found in mishnah ten, the dough is not prohibited to everyone because of the kilayim, since the kilayim leaven was not in and of itself sufficient to cause fermentation. The question asked in our mishnah is: what about the terumah leaven? Does it join with the kilayim leaven to cause the dough to be forbidden to priests?

Mishnah Fourteen
Leaven of terumah and of kilayim of the vineyard which fell into dough, this one is not sufficient to cause fermentation, nor is that one sufficient to cause fermentation, but together they cause fermentation:
1) It [the dough] is prohibited to non-priests and permitted to priests.   
2) Rabbi Shimon permits it to both to non-priests and to priests.

Explanation
Section one: The rabbis in mishnah twelve hold that two forbidden substances join together to create a prohibition. Since both terumah and kilayim are prohibited to non-priests, the dough is prohibited to non-priests. However, the dough is not prohibited to priests because priests can eat terumah and the kilayim leaven was not sufficient to cause fermentation on its own.
Section two: Rabbi Shimon is consistent with his own opinion in mishnah ten, that substances of different categories do not combine. The leaven of terumah and the leaven of kilayim do not combine and since neither is sufficient to cause fermentation, the dough is permitted to everyone.
