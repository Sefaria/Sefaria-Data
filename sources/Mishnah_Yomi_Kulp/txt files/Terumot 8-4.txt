Terumot, Chapter Eight,  Mishnah Four

Introduction
Our mishnah teaches that it was forbidden to drink water, wine and milk that had been left uncovered for fear that a snake had put poison into the mixture. Whether this was a realistic fear, or a superstition shared by many people, I don’t know. We should note that by the middle ages most halakhic authorities had stated that this halakhah no longer applies. 

Mishnah Four
1) If wine of terumah was left uncovered, it must be poured out, and there is no need to say this in the case of hullin.   
2) Three kinds of liquids are forbidden if they were left uncovered: water, wine and milk, but all other drinks are permitted. 
3) How long do they remain uncovered for them to become prohibited? 
a) The time it takes the snake to creep out from a place near by and drink.  

Explanation
Section one: Normally, it is forbidden to cause terumah to come to ruin. Pure terumah must be eaten. However, if the terumah wine was left uncovered, the rabbis considered it dangerous to drink it. The concern for the danger to one’s life overrides the prohibition of causing terumah to be lost and therefore, if the terumah wine was left uncovered, he should spill it out. It is obvious that he should spill out hullin (non-sacred) wine that had been left uncovered.
Section two: It was assumed that snakes wouldn’t drink from anything but water, wine and milk. Therefore, only these three are prohibited if left uncovered. I wonder if they had had Coca-Cola back then, would snakes have drunk from it? 
Section three: The liquid must be left uncovered long enough for a snake to sneak up and inject his poison into it. If you just leave your cup uncovered for a moment while you get something from the refrigerator (to be anachronistic) you can still go back and finish your drink. But if you go out to the backyard to play football with your kids for a few minutes, leaving your glass of milk on the table, you may be at risk.
