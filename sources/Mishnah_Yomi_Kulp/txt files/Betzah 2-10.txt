Betzah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
This mishnah is here because of its connection with the previous mishnah, and not because of any connection with the laws of Yom Tov.  It continues to deal with the impurity of vessels.

Mishnah Ten
1) A child’s cart is susceptible to the impurity of midras, and it may be handled on Shabbat, and it is dragged along only on matting.  
2) Rabbi Judah says: no vessels may be dragged along [the ground] except a wagon because it [only] presses [the earth] down.

Explanation
Section one:  A child’s cart is one that a small child would push around while learning how to walk (today these make sounds and have spinning things to keep your child entertained while you fold the laundry).  Since the cart is made to lean upon, it can receive a type of impurity called “midras.”   “Midras” means pressure.  A zav or a zavah (a man or woman with an abnormal genital discharge) who steps, sits, lies or leans upon this cart, in other words applies bodily pressure to the cart, will render it impure. This type of impurity is derived from Leviticus 15:4. 
The cart may be handled on Shabbat and on Yom Tov.  It is not muktzeh.  However, it is forbidden to drag it along the ground because it will make grooves in the ground.  This is a forbidden labor on Shabbat and on Yom Tov which is derived from the forbidden labor of plowing.  The only way to use it is to drag it on some type of matting.  
Section two:  Rabbi Judah holds that the cart is the one type of vessel that may be dragged on the ground on Shabbat.  All other vessels when dragged will create grooves in the ground.  The cart when dragged will only press down the ground, without creating grooves.  Hence, your little toddler can push his little cart knowing that he is not violating Shabbat.
