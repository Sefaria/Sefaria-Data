Shabbat, Chapter Three, Mishnah Four

Introduction
This mishnah discusses heating water on Shabbat.

Mishnah Four
1)   It once happened that the people of Tiberias conducted a pipe of cold water through an arm of the hot springs.     
a) The sages said to them: if this happened on the Shabbat, it is like hot water heated on the Shabbat, and is forbidden both for washing and for drinking;
b) If on a festival, it is like water heated on a festival, which is forbidden for washing but permitted for drinking.
2)   A miliarum which is cleared of its ashes--they may drink from it on Shabbat. 
3)   An antiki even if its ashes have been cleared--they may not drink from it.    

Explanation
Section one:  In Tiberias before Shabbat the people set up a pipe of cold water to flow through the hot springs so that the water in the pipe would heat up on Shabbat and they would have hot water for drinking and bathing.  This is not actually cooking because there is no fire, but it is similar enough to cooking such that this is prohibited on Shabbat.  Therefore on Shabbat it is forbidden to use this water for either cooking or washing.  On festivals (Yom Tov) it is permitted to cook in order to eat.  Therefore, if they did this on the festival they may use the water for drinking, but not for washing.  It is not permitted to heat water for washing on a festival.
Section two:  A miliarum is a clay vessel for water which has a pipe in it in which they would put hot coals to heat water.  One can drink the water from a milarium only if the coals were removed before Shabbat.  
Section three:  An antiki is a copper pot which has a large place to put coals in it so that the water would get very hot.  It retains its heat better than a mililarum.  Since it retains its heat so well, it is forbidden to use it on Shabbat even if the coals have been removed before Shabbat.
