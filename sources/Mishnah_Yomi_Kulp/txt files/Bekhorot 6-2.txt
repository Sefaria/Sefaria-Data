Bekhorot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah deals with blemishes of the eye. Leviticus 21:20 states that a priest that has a blemish in his eye cannot serve on the altar. Our mishnah explains what that means, at least with regard to the blemished animal.  

Mishnah Two 
1) One whose eyelid is pierced, defected or slit, 
2) Or if the eye has a cataract, or a tevalul, halazon [snail-shaped], nahash [snake-shaped] or a [berry-shaped] growth on the eye, [the animal is disqualified]. 
3) What is a tevalul? The white of the eye breaking through the ring and entering into the black. But if the black breaks through the ring and goes into the white, it is not a [disqualifying] blemish, because there are no disqualifying blemishes as regards the white of the eye. 

Explanation
Section one: If the eyelid is pierced, defected or slit, the animal is considered blemished.
Section two: Most of this section deals with various growths on the eye. A cataract will also disqualify the animal. 
Section three: The mishnah now explains “tevalul” which is the word used in Leviticus 21:20 for an eye blemish. If a white thread goes out from the white of the eye and enters the pupil, the animal is considered blemished, because this would affect its vision. However, if the black has broken through to the white the animal is not considered blemished, because blemishes have to be the pupil and not to the white part of the eye.
