Niddah, Chapter Five, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Today's mishnah contains several opinions as to what constitutes the physical development of a girl such that she is considered a bogeret. All four of these opinions relate to the development of the girl's breasts.
I think that the translation of these four opinions is sufficient to understand them, therefore there is no commentary below.   

Mishnah Eight
What are the signs [of a bogeret]? 
1) Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: the appearance of   the wrinkle beneath the breast. 
2) Rabbi Akiva says: from when the breasts hang down. 
3) Ben Azzai says: the darkening of the ring around the nipple. 
4) Rabbi Yose says: [the development of the breast to a stage] when one's hand is put on the nipple it sinks and only slowly rises again.
