Terumot, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Our mishnah teaches that hullin that absorbs the smell of something that was terumah is still permitted to non-priests.

Mishnah Four 
If an oven was heated with cumin of terumah and bread was baked in it, the bread is permitted, for there is no taste of cumin, just the smell of cumin.  

Explanation
If someone uses sticks of terumah cumin as kindling for his oven the bread cooked in the oven does not take on the status of terumah because the cumin gives off a smell but not a taste. The fact that the bread smells like terumah does not make it prohibited to non-priests because non-priests can smell terumah, they just can’t eat it.
