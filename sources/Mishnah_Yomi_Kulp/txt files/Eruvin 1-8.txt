Eruvin, Chapter One, Mishnah Eight

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with the conditions under which members of a traveling caravan may carry.

Mishnah Eight
If a caravan camped in a valley and it was surrounded by the instruments used for the cattle it is permissible to move objects within it, provided [the instruments] form a fence ten handbreadths high and the gaps do not exceed the built-up parts.  
Any gap which is wider than ten cubits it is permitted [to carry within], because it is like an entrance.
If it is greater, it is forbidden [to carry within]. 

Explanation
A valley is considered neither a public domain (since a true public domain is only one which is used as a public thoroughfare), nor is it a private domain.  It is called by the rabbis a “karmelit” and it is forbidden by rabbinic ordinance (derabbanan) to carry within one.  However, if the caravan which finds itself on Shabbat in a valley sets up there a makeshift fence by using the instruments used in caring for the cattle, they may carry within this area, if several conditions are met.  First of all, the instruments must be ten handbreadths high to be considered a “fence.”  This is because walls must be ten handbreadths high.  Second, the gaps between the instruments cannot be greater than the area covered by the instruments.  In other words, more must be closed than open. Thirdly, there can be no gap greater than ten cubits.  A ten or less cubit gap can be considered an entrance to this enclosed area.  More than that cannot be considered an entrance and thus turns the entire area into an unfenced area.  This is true even if the total area closed by the instruments is greater than the gaps.  However, if they put up two side-posts and a crossbeam over a more than ten cubit gap, this would turn the gap into an entrance and it would become permitted to carry within the area.
