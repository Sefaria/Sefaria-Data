Sukkot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Three

Introduction
Today’s mishnah continues the description of the incredible light which shone from the menorah at the Simchat Bet Hashoevah.

Mishnah Three
1) From the worn-out pants and belts of the priests they made wicks and with them they kindled the lamps.
2) And there was not a courtyard in Jerusalem that was not illuminated by the light of the Bet Hashoevah.

Explanation
Section one:  The wicks that they used to light the candles were not made from any old ordinary material.  They used the worn-out pants and belts the priests, which they wore in their Temple service. This teaches us that once something has been used for one mitzvah it is fitting that it should be used in another mitzvah as well.
Section two:  The light from the menorah was so great that according to the mishnah it lit up all of Jerusalem.
