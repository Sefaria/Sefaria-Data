Bava Kamma Chapter Three Mishnayot 1

Introduction
The following two mishnayot (plural of mishnah) deal with damages that a person’s possessions might cause in the public domain.  In general if a person leaves something in the public domain and someone else comes along and breaks it the person who broke it is not obligated to pay for the broken item.  Furthermore, if the person who breaks the object is also injured while doing so, the owner of the object will be liable for his injuries.  

Mishnah One
1) If a man left a jug in the public domain and another came and stumbled over it and broke it, he is exempt.  
a) And if he was injured by it, the owner of the jug is liable for his injury.
2) If a man’s jug broke in the public domain, and another slipped on the water, or was hurt by the potsherds, he is liable.
a) Rabbi Judah says:  “If he [broke the jug] with intention, he is liable,
b) But if he broke it without intention he is not liable.”


Explanation
In the first section of mishnah one we learn that a person does not have the right to leave his objects in the public domain.  Therefore if he should do so and another should come along and break the object, the person who broke it is exempt and if he should be injured the owner is liable.
In section 2 Rabbi Judah teaches us a new principle, that of intention.  If a person accidentally put a damaging object into the public domain he is not liable for subsequent damages.  One is only liable if he put the damaging object into the public domain on purpose.
