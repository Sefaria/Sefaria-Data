Gittin, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Six

Introduction
To understand this mishnah we must remind ourselves of the first chapter of Yevamoth, and especially mishnah four.  There we learned that if a man was married to two women, and he died childless, and one of those women was forbidden to his brother, for instance the brother was married to that woman’s sister, not only is the prohibited woman herself exempt (a man may not marry two sisters) from yibbum/halitzah (Levirate marriage and release thereof) but her rival wives are also exempt.  

Mishnah Six
With regard to all of the near relatives concerning whom they said “their rivals are permitted to marry [without halitzah]”:  If the rival wives went and married and it was then found that this one (the near relative) was an aylonit, [the rival wife who married] must leave both husbands and all these consequences apply to her.

Explanation
In our mishnah, a man was married to a woman who is prohibited to the yavam (brother-in-law) and he is also married to other women.  When he dies, since one wife is prohibited to the yavam, all of her rival wives are exempt from yibbum and halitzah.  The rival wives therefore remarry without halitzah.  If it turns out that widow who was prohibited to the yavam was an aylonit, a woman who never reaches physical maturity, then her marriage to her first husband was invalid and her rival wives should have had halitzah with the brother-in-law before remarrying.  Therefore, the remarried rival wives may not remain with their current husbands nor may they marry the yavam either.  All of the above consequences also apply to them.
This mishnah regards the child of a woman who did not undergo halitzah as a mamzer.  However, the halakhah is not according to this mishnah and the child is not considered a mamzer.
