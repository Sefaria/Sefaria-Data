Peah, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Five

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with whether when one thins out the grapes from a grapevine so that the other grapes will have more room to grow one can also thin away the defective clusters that are supposed to go to the poor.  

Mishnah Five
One who is thinning out vines, just as he may thin out in that which belongs to him, so too he may thin out in that which belongs to the poor, the words of Rabbi Judah. 
Rabbi Meir says: in that which belongs to him, he is permitted, but he is not permitted in that which belongs to the poor. 

Explanation
To make room for the grapes to grow, a grape farmer might thin out the vines and get rid of the some of the clusters. The problem is that this might cause a loss to the poor, especially if he gets rid of many of the defective clusters. Rabbi Judah says that nevertheless when thinning out vines one may thin out the defective clusters that belong to the poor.  
Rabbi Meir says that he may not, because the defective clusters don’t belong to him, rather they belong to the poor.
