Hallah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
Before people bought yeast at the supermarket, people used starter dough to leaven their bread. They would take a piece of leavened dough (sour dough) from one batch and put it into another batch. Our mishnah deals with a person who takes starter dough from a batch of dough from which hallah had not been taken, and puts it into a batch of dough from which hallah had been taken. He obviously wants to avoid having to separate hallah again from dough which already had hallah removed.
 
Mishnah Eight
One who takes leaven out of dough from which hallah had not been taken and puts it into dough from which hallah had been taken:
1) If he has a supply from another place, he can take out [hallah] in accordance with the precise amount.   
2) But if does not, he takes out one [portion of] hallah for the whole [dough]. 

Explanation
Section one:  If he has another batch of dough (a third batch) from which hallah had not yet been removed, and he can use that batch to remove hallah to exempt the leaven which he put into another batch (meaning that batch is large enough), then he may do so according to the amount of leaven he added to the other batch. 
Section two: However, if he does not have another batch of hallah, then he must remove hallah from the batch to which he added the leaven according to the amount of dough in the entire batch, even though he only added a little bit of leaven. Since he can’t separate hallah for that little bit of leaven from another batch, it places the entire batch into which it has been under the category of dough from which hallah has not been removed.
