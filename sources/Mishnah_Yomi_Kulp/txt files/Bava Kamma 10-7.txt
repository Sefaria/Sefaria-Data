Bava Kamma Chapter Ten Mishna Seven 

Introduction
Mishnah Seven deals with a person who either stole, borrowed or received a deposit from another person and does not know whether he has paid him back.
Mishnah Eight deals with a person who stole from another and returned the object without telling the original owner that it was returned. 

Mishnah Seven
1) If a man said to his fellow, “I robbed you”, [or], “You lent me [something]”, [or] “You deposited [something] with me, but I do not know whether I returned it or not” he is obligated to repay.
2) But if he said, “I do not know whether I robbed you, [or], “whether you lent me [something]”, or “whether you deposited [something] with me”, he is exempt from repaying.

Explanation
In section one of our mishnah the speaker is certain that he at one point had something that belonged to his fellow, either by stealing, borrowing or receiving the object as a deposit, but he is uncertain whether he returned the object.  Since the last verifiable status of the object is with the robber, borrower or one who received a deposit, and it is doubtful whether he returned it, he is obligated to repay the value of the object to the original owner.  In section two, the speaker is uncertain whether he ever had possession of the object.  In this case the last verifiable status of the object is with the original owner.  Therefore, the speaker does not have to repay.  In other words, in both cases we assume that the object is still where it was last verifiably ascertained to be and we adjudicate accordingly.


Questions for Further Thought:
 Mishnah Seven:  Might you have thought that there would be a legal difference between a person who admits to robbing another person versus a person who admits that he received a deposit?  Why doesn’t the mishnah make a difference between these two scenarios?
