
Mishnah Four
If one leased a field from his fellow and he did not want to weed it, and he said to the owner, “What do you care, as long as I pay you the agreed rental?”, they do not listen to him, for the owner can say to him, “Tomorrow you will leave the field and it won’t bring forth anything but weeds.”

Explanation—Mishnah Four
According to our mishnah a sharecropper is responsible to weed the field that he is working.  Even if he were to say to the owner that he will still give him the full amount of the rental agreement, the owner can force the sharecropper to weed, since not weeding will cause future damage to the field.  It is in the owner’s best interests that should the sharecropper leave he could rent the field to others.
