Mishnah Twelve
1) A poor metzora who brought the sacrifice of a rich man has fulfilled his duty; 
a) But a rich metzora that brought the sacrifice of a poor man has not fulfilled his duty. 
2) A man may bring a poor man's sacrifice for his son, his daughter, his slave or his female, and thereby enable them to eat of the offerings.   
3) Rabbi Judah says: for his wife also he must bring the sacrifice of a rich man; and the same applies to any other sacrifice to which she is liable.

Explanation
Section one: A poor person can bring a rich person's sacrifices, should he so desire, but a rich person cannot bring a poor person's sacrifice. In other words, the Torah allows one to bring birds if he can't afford to bring lambs. But the lambs are always acceptable.
Section two: A householder can bring sacrifices on behalf of the members of his household, and thereby allow them to eat other offerings. A person can eat sacrificial offerings only once his proper sacrifices have been brought (i.e. those that end his status as metzora).
Section three: Rabbi Judah notes that if a rich man brings sacrifices for his wife, he must bring the sacrifices of a rich man. This is true whether she needs to bring the sacrifices of a metzora, or other such sacrifices such as those a woman brings after childbirth.
