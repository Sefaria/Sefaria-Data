Rosh Hashanah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Two

Introduction 
This mishnah opens the second half of tractate Rosh Hashanah, which deals mostly with the laws of the shofar and the shofar blasts, as well as the special mussaf prayers for Rosh Hashanah.  In this mishnah rabbis debate what animals’ horns may be used for the shofar  

Mishnah Two
1) All shofars may be used except for that of a cow, because it is a keren.  
2) Rabbi Yose said: Are not all shofars called keren as it says, “When they make a long blast with the ram’s keren [horn]?” (Isaiah 6:5). 

Explanation 
Section one: According to the first opinion, all shofars can be used on Rosh Hashanah expect for the horn of a cow, because the horn of a cow is not called a shofar but rather a keren, which is a Hebrew word for horn.  The reason that we require a horn called a shofar is that Leviticus 25:9 uses the word shofar in connection with Yom Kippur of the Jubilee year, and the rabbis say that this shofar is the paradigm for the shofar of Rosh Hashanah.
The types of shofar that can be used are specifically that of a ram (an ayil in Hebrew), which is usually bent, and that of an ibex (a yael in Hebrew), which is straight.
Section two:  Rabbi Yose points out that the horn of a ram is also called a keren, as proven from the quote from Isaiah.  And if a ram’s horn can be used even though it is called a keren, why can’t the horn of a cow be used?
The other rabbis don’t respond to Rabbi Yose in the mishnah.  The Talmud, however does provide their reponse.  The rabbis respond to Rabbi Yose that all horns of animals are called both keren and shofar, whereas that of a cow is called only keren. This means that in order for a horn to be used it has to be called a shofar but not necessarily exclusively.
