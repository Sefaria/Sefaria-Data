Hallah, Chapter Two, Mishnah One
 
Introduction
Our mishnah deals with whether one is liable to separate hallah from produce that is grown outside the land of Israel.

Mishnah One
1) Produce [grown] outside the land [of Israel] that came into the land is subject to Hallah.
2) [If it] went out from here to there: 
a) Rabbi Eliezer makes it liable,  
b) But Rabbi Akiva makes it exempt. 

Explanation
Section one: Outside the land of Israel, one is not obligated to separate hallah from dough. However, if the produce, in this case grain, was grown outside the land, and then brought in, it is liable for hallah, because the flour was mixed with water inside the land of Israel. As we have seen, when it comes to separating hallah, the critical moment is when the flour is mixed with dough.
Section two: If the produce was grown in the land of Israel, but then brought outside the land and there it was made into dough, Rabbi Eliezer says that it is still liable for hallah. This seems to be based on a midrash of Numbers 15:19 which states, “from the bread of the land” and bread made from the produce of the land is still “bread of the land” no matter where it is made.
Rabbi Akiva says he is exempt, because the very same verse states, “When you enter the land to which I am taking you…” The implication is that when you are not in the land, you are not liable for hallah.
