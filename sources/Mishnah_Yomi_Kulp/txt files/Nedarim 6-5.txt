Nedarim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah discusses one who vows abstinence from different milk products.  

Mishnah Five
1) He who vows [abstinence] from milk is permitted to eat curds.   
a) But Rabbi Yose forbids it. 
2) [He who vows abstinence] “from curds,” is permitted milk. 
3) Abba Shaul says: he who vows abstinence from cheese, is prohibited to eat [cheese], whether salted or unsalted.

Explanation
Section one:  A person who vowed abstinence from milk may still eat curds, the water that remains after milk has been curdled into cheese.  This is not called milk and hence is not forbidden.  Rabbi Yose disagrees.
Section two:  Again, curds are not considered to be milk and hence one who forbids himself from eating curds may still drink milk.
Section three:  A vow of abstinence from cheese forbids one from eating any kind of cheese.
