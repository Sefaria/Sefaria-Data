Menahot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah discusses from where and from what they brought the olive oil used in the minhah offering. 
 
Mishnah Three
1) Tekoa is “alpha” first its oil. 
2) Abba Saul says: Second to it is Regev, on the other side of the Jordan. 
3) The [oil of the] whole land was valid, but they used to bring it only from these places. 
4) One may not bring it from a manured field or from an irrigated field or from olive-trees   planted in a field sown with seeds, but if one did bring it [from these] it was valid. 
5) One may not bring anpakinon, and if one did bring it, it is invalid.   
6) One may not bring it from olive-berries which had been soaked in water or preserved or stewed; and if one did bring it, it is invalid.

Explanation
Section one: Tekoa, which is in the Negev and is mentioned in II Samuel 14:2 has the best oil.
Section two: Second to it is Regev, which lies on the other side of the Jordan. 
Section three: As with the grain, any oil from olives grown in the land of Israel is valid, but these two places were customary and preferable. Note that Regev is considered to be part of the land of Israel, even though it lies on the other side of the Jordan.
Section four: These are basically the same rules as we saw in yesterday’s mishnah with regard to the grain. Olive-trees which grown in grain fields are weaker and hence their olives will not be as good. 
Section five: Anpakinon is a Greek word for olive oil from olives that were not fully ripened. Since this olive oil is of far inferior quality, it cannot be used. 
Section six: Olive-berries are the small unripe olives. Sometimes they would soak these in water, or preserve them or stew them in order to get oil out of them. Such oil cannot be used for the minhah offering because it too is vastly inferior.
