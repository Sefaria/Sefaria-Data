Sheviit, Chapter One, Mishnah Three

Introduction
In yesterday’s mishnah we learned that in order for the field to be considered an orchard, it needs to have three trees that bear a certain amount of fruit.  Our mishnah adds that if there are non-fruit-bearing trees in the field, we look at them as if they were fig trees. In other words, if these trees are large enough such that if they were fig trees each tree would have been able to produce a cake of pressed figs the size of sixty maneh, then they count and the whole field may be plowed.  If they are smaller, then the whole field may not be plowed; only the space surrounding that tree may be plowed. The remainder of the mishnah is just a repeat of yesterday’s mishnah. 

Mishnah Three 
Whether they are fruit-bearing trees or non-fruit-bearing trees, we treat them as if they were fig-trees. If they are capable of yielding a cake of pressed figs, the size of sixty in the Italian maneh, then the entire bet seah may be plowed for their sake.  If less than this amount, they may plow them only for their own needs.
