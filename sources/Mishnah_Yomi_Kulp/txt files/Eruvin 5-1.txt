Eruvin, Chapter Five, Mishnah One

Introduction 
The Hebrew word for “extensions” here is the same word used to extend the month (from 28 to 29 days) and to extend the year (from 12 to 13 months).  The “extensions” to the city are critical when figuring out how far the Shabbat limit goes.  Before we reckon the 2000 cubits around the city, we must first delineate exactly what is included in the city.  

Mishnah One
How do they make extensions for cities [for the purpose of defining the Shabbat limit]?   
1) If one house recedes and another projects,
2) Or if one turret [of the wall] recedes and another projects, 
3) If there were ruins ten handbreadths high, or bridges, or sepulchral monuments that contained dwelling places, 
a) they extend the boundary of the town is to include them.  
4) And they make it [the Shabbat limit] like a square tablet in order that the use of the corners might be gained. 

Explanation 
Section one:  If at the end of the city there is a row of houses, but the row is not set up evenly, the Shabbat limit is measured from the house that projects the most and not from the house that recedes.  
Section two:  If there is part of the wall (such as a turret, a tower used to guard the city) which projects further than other parts, the Shabbat limit is measured from the further projection. 
Section three:  If there were ruins outside the parts of the city, or bridges or structures made over graves, then all of these are also included in the city.
Section four: When they come to set the Shabbat limit, the first thing they do is make the city into a rectangle, with the furthest structure on each side being the city’s limits.  Even if the city is circular, they draw a rectangle around it, so that people get some extra place to travel at the corners.  The 2000 cubits are now measured in a square around this square, so that people again get the benefit of the corners (see also above 4:8).
