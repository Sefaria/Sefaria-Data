Kilayim, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Six

Introduction 
This mishnah discusses a tailor who may have materials made of wool and linen sitting on his lap waiting to be sewn.

Mishnah Six
1) Tailors may sew [materials which are kilayim] in their usual way, as long as they do have not the intention in the sun, [to protect themselves] from the sun, or in the rain [to protect themselves] from the rain.
2) The scrupulous sew [such materials as they are laid] on the ground.  

Explanation
Section one: As in yesterday’s mishnah concerning the clothes salesman, the rules of kilayim also do not apply to a tailor who has various types of material resting on his lap waiting to be sewn.  Again, this is prohibited if he intends to use the material as protection from sun or rain.
Section two: Again, similar to yesterday’s mishnah, those who are more religiously scrupulous would not take advantage of such a leniency. Rather, they would lay the materials on the ground while they were waiting to be sewn.
