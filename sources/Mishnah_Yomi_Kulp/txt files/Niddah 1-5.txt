Niddah, Chapter One, Mishnah Five

Introduction 
Today's mishnah defines whom is considered an old woman, that need not be concerned that she retroactively defiled things. 
The mishnah uses the world "onah" (in plural "onot"). An "onah" is the period in which she is supposed to have been menstruating. Generally, an "onah" is 30 days, although obviously this may vary from woman to woman.

Mishnah Five
1) Who is regarded as "an old woman"? 
a) Any woman over whom three "onot" have passed near the time of her old age.  
2) Rabbi Eliezer says: for any woman over whom have passed three onot it suffices [to reckon her period of uncleanness from] the time of her [observing a flow]. 
3) Rabbi Yose says: for a woman in pregnancy and a nursing woman over whom three onot have passed  it suffices [to reckon their period of uncleanness from] the time of their [observation of the flow].

Explanation
Section one:  A woman who has missed her period three times in a row, roughly 90 days, and is close to old age (so this is not because she is pregnant or sick or some other reason) is now considered "an old woman." Obviously, this makes sense in this context. A woman who has stopped menstruating due to menopause is old for the issue discussed in this mishnah—what type of woman does not regularly menstruate.
Section two: Rabbi Eliezer says that any woman who has missed three periods for any reason, even if she is not old, needs only reckon her period of impurity from the time she sees blood. 
Section three: According to mishnah four, as soon as a woman's pregnancy is noticeable, or as soon as she begins to nurse her child, she would only count her period of impurity from the time blood flows. According to Rabbi Yose, she must first go through three periods without menstruating.
