Explanation
Section one: After waking them up, the superintendent would take the key and open the small door in the fire chamber that was connected to the courtyard. The regular gates to the courtyard did not open until it began to be light outside. The priests then entered the courtyard each carrying two torches.
Section two: They then divided into two groups to check the Temple to make sure that everything was still in its proper place.
Section three: Each day the high priest would offer a tenth of an ephah of griddle cakes, half in the morning and half in the evening (see Leviticus 6:13-14; Menahot 4:5). They would end their examination at the place where these cakes were made and each group would ask the other if everything was okay. They would then formally appoint those who made the griddle-cakes to make the griddle-cakes.
