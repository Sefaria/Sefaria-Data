Temurah, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Five

Introduction
In yesterday’s mishnah we learned which forbidden items must be buried. Today we learn that other forbidden things must be burned.

Mishnah Five
And the following are to be burned: 
1) Chametz on Pesah is burned; 
2) Unclean terumah; 
3) Orlah;   
4) Kilayim (mixed seeds) in the vineyard--that which it is customary to burn is to be burned and that which it is customary to bury is to be buried. 
5) We may kindle with the bread and oil of [unclean] terumah. 

Explanation
Section one: If one finds chametz (leavened bread) on Pesah, he must burn it. 
Sections two-four: Unclean terumah, orlah (fruit in its first three years of growth) and seeds sewn in a vineyard must be burned. If these come in a form that is impossible to burn, such as juice made of orlah fruit, then it should be buried. But if it can be burned, than it should be burned. 
Section five: When burning unclean terumah, one may use the light and heat to derive benefit. This is not the case when it comes to burning chametz on Pesah, orlah, or kilayim. It is forbidden to derive any benefit from these substances, even from the fire in which they are being burned.
