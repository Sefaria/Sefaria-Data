Shabbat, Chapter Seventeen, Mishnah Four

Introduction 
This mishnah provides some general rules concerning which vessels may be carried on Shabbat and when they may be carried.

Mishnah Four
1) Rabbi Yose says: all vessels may be carried, except a large saw and the pin of a plough.  
2) All vessels may be carried whether required or not required. 
a) Rabbi Nehemiah says: they may be handled only for what is required.

Explanation
Section one:  The reason that one may not carry a large saw or the pin of a plough is that people are very careful not to ruin these things.  Since they are so careful with these things, they won’t use them for other purposes, and since the normal use of these things is prohibited on Shabbat, they may not be carried at all.
Section two:  According to the first opinion in the mishnah, all vessels may be carried whether there is a need for them or not.  In the Talmud there is a debate what it means when the mishnah says they are “not required.”  According to one explanation, “not required” means that the person doesn’t want to use the vessel itself, but rather wants to move it away from its current place.  For instance, I might want to move a knife not to use the knife to cut something but to keep it away from my child.  According to this explanation, there must be some purpose to moving the knife.  Another explanation is that “not required” means that the person is carrying it for no reason whatsoever.  Our explanation of this clause will impact our explanation of Rabbi Nehemiah’s debate.  According to the first explanation, Rabbi Nehemiah forbids carrying the object unless the object itself is needed. For instance, a knife may be carried only if one wants to use the knife itself.  According to the second explanation, Rabbi Nehemiah would allow carrying the knife even if one only wants to move it to clear it from its current place.  He would forbid moving the vessel only if there was truly no purpose to doing so.
