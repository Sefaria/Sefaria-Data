Peah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
The final mishnah of chapter three continues to discuss a person who assigns his property in writing (using a document) to someone else, in this case a slave.
 
Mishnah Eight
1) One who assigns in writing his possessions to his slave, [the slave] thereby goes free.   
a) If he reserved for himself any land, however small, he does not become free.   
2) Rabbi Shimon says: he always becomes free, unless [the master] says: “Behold, all my goods are given to so-and-so my slave, with the exception of one ten-thousandth part of them.”

Explanation
Section one:  If a master writes a document giving all of his property to his slave, then he has given the slave possession of himself, for the slave is part of his property, and his slave goes free.  However, if he retains even a small amount of land for himself, but does not specify what piece of land he is retaining, the slave does not go free.  This is because we assume that the land that he retained for himself refers to the slave and therefore he has not set the slave free. Slaves are compared to land in Leviticus 25:45-46.  Furthermore, since the slave has not acquired his freedom, he cannot acquire property, for everything that a slave acquires goes over to his master. Therefore the entire deal is off and the master retains ownership over all of his property.
Section two:  Rabbi Shimon disagrees and holds that even if he retains a small amount of land for himself, the slave still goes free.  The slave only stays a slave if the master specifically states that he is retaining even a small amount of property for himself. In such a case we say that the property that he retained for himself was the slave.
