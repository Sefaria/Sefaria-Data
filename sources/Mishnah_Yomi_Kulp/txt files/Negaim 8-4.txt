Negaim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Four

Mishnah Four
1) In all cases of breaking out and covering the ends of the limbs whereby the unclean have been pronounced clean, if they reappeared they become unclean again. 
2) In all cases of reappearance of the ends of the limbs whereby the clean have been pronounced unclean, if they were covered again these become clean again. 
3) If subsequently they become uncovered these are unclean, even if this occurs a hundred times.  

Explanation
Section one: In any case where a nega covered a person's entire body and even the ends of his limbs and he was pronounced clean, and then the ends reappeared in their natural color he is unclean. This is as we learned in mishnah one: if a nega covers a person's entire body and he was previously impure, he is pure. If the nega retracts, he becomes impure again.
Section two:  If the ends of the limbs are first uncovered (meaning the nega disappears) and then they are covered again by the nega, the person goes back to being pure. This is another case of a nega covering an impure person's entire body.
Section three: This process can continue without end. In other words, the rule that if a nega spreads to one's entire body and that person was previously impure that he becomes pure remains no matter how many times the process occurs.
