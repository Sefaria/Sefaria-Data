Five


Mishnah Five
1) So too, [two men deposited] vessels with a third, one worth 100 zuz and the other worth 1000 zuz.
a) [Afterward] one claimed that the valuable one was his and the other claimed that the valuable one was his.
b) He gives the less valuable one to one of them and from the value of the more valuable one he gives the value of the lesser one to the other person, and the rest remains until Elijah comes.
2) Rabbi Yose says:  “If so, what does the deceiver lose?  Rather the whole is left until Elijah comes.”
