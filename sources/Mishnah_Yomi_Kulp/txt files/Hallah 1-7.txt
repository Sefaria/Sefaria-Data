Hallah, Chapter One, Mishnah Seven

Introduction 
This mishnah deals with dough prepared by a baker and whether it is liable for hallah.

Mishnah Seven
1) A baker who made dough to divide it up into pieces, it is subject to hallah.   
2) Women who gave [flour] to a baker to make for them dough, if there is not in any one of them a [minimum] measure, it is exempt from hallah.  

Explanation
Section one: The baker makes a large batch of dough which he intends to divide up into small pieces, each of which contain less than the measure necessary for dough to be liable for hallah (five quarters of a kav). He will sell the smaller pieces of dough to individuals, who will let it rise and then bake it themselves. This dough is liable for hallah, because if he can’t find people to buy it, he will bake it all himself. Potentially, this is going to end up as one person’s dough. 
Section two: On the other hand, if a few women give flour to a baker, and each woman gives less than is necessary for dough to be liable for hallah, then the dough is exempt from hallah. The difference between this case and the case in section one is that here the small pieces of dough are already owned by different individuals. This mishnah teaches that dough owned by different people does not join together to become liable for hallah.
