Eruvin, Chapter Seven, Mishnah One

Introduction 
The first five mishnayot of this chapter deal with two courtyards that are adjacent to one another and whether or not they may make a joint eruv.

Mishnah One
1) If a window between two courtyards was four handbreadths by four handbreadths, and was within ten handbreadths [from the ground], the tenants prepare two eruvin or, if they want, they may prepare one.   
2) If [the size of the window was] less than four handbreadths by four handbreadths or higher than ten handbreadths from the ground, they may prepare two eruvin but not one.

Explanation
Section one:  If there is a window which is four by four handbreadths and is less than ten handbreadths from the ground, then this window has the potential but not the necessity to join the two courtyards into one common domain.  If the residents of the two courtyards make one joint eruv, then they may both carry in both courtyards, because both courtyards are in essence one.  If they set up separate eruvin, the residents may carry only in their own courtyards.
Section two:  However, if the window was smaller than four by four handbreadths, or higher, then it doesn’t join the two courtyards and each can only set up their own eruv.  The reason why the window does not join the two courtyards if it is set higher is that in such a case there is a full ten handbreadth wall separating the two.  Such a wall is sufficient to count as a full separation.  Furthermore, with a window this high it will be difficult to see from one courtyard into the other, helping separate their identities.
