Mishnah Four
1) A testing rag that was placed under a pillow and some blood was found: 
a) If it is round it is clean 
b) If it is elongated it is unclean, the words of Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok.

Explanation
The testing rag is what a woman uses after sexual intercourse to see if she was menstruating. The woman placed it under her pillow so she could look at it in the morning. According to Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok, if she finds on it a round blood stain, then she can assume that it came from a louse and she is pure. However, if she finds an elongated blood stain then it was likely to be from when she checked herself and she is impure.
