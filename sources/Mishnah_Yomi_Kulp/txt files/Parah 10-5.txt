Parah, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Five

Mishnah Five
1) If he was standing outside an oven and he stretched out his hand to a window and he took a flask and passed it over the oven: 
a) Rabbi Akiva says that it is unclean, 
b) And the sages say that it is clean. 
2) But he who was clean for the hatat waters may stand over an oven while holding in his hand an empty vessel that is clean for the hatat waters or one filled with water that has not yet been mixed [with the ashes of the red cow].

Explanation
Section one: Rabbi Akiva says that since the flask passed over the oven, it is unclean. This is a corollary to his opinion in yesterday's mishnah. There the flask was not directly over the oven, so it remained clean. Here it is directly over the oven, so it becomes unclean. The sages' opinion is also a corollary of their opinion in yesterday's mishnah. Since he is not standing on the oven, the flask remains pure. 
Section two: As long as the flask/vessel is not one which contains the mixture of ashes and water, it remains pure when placed over the oven.
