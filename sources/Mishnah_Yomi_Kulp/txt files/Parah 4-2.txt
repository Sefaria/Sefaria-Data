Parah, Chapter Four, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Our mishnah continues to list things that can disqualify the validity of the burning of the red cow.

Mishnah Two 
1) If it was burnt outside its pit, or in two pits, or if two cows were burnt in the same pit, it is invalid. 
2) If [the blood] was sprinkled but not in the direction of the entrance of the Holy of Holies, it is invalid. 
3) If he made the seventh sprinkling out of the sixth and then sprinkled again a seventh time, it is invalid. 
4) If he sprinkled an eighth time out of the seventh and then sprinkled again an eighth time, it is valid.

Explanation
Section one: In 3:10 we learned that they would make a pit in which to burn the red cow. If it was burned outside of this pit, or if they made two pits, it is invalid. Similarly, they can't make two red cows in one pit. This is similar to the prohibition of not using one cow to prod out another in 3:7.
Section two: The blood must be sprinkled in the correct direction for it to be valid (see 3:9).
Section three: If the priest dips his finger into the blood and sprinkles a sixth time, and then with the remaining blood sprinkles a seventh time, it is invalid, even if he goes back and sprinkles another "seventh" time. The problem is that he sprinkled once without dipping and we learned in 3:9 that for every sprinkle he needs to redip his finger.
Section four: In this case he sprinkled correctly seven times and then with the remains of the seventh sprinkle he performed an eighth sprinkling and then again dippied his finger and did another eighth sprinkling. Since he did seven proper sprinklings, the fact that he added more does not invalidate the act.
