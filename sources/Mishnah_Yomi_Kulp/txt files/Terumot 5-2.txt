Terumot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Today’s mishnah deals with a case where a seah of unclean terumah fell into a seah of clean hullin. The terumah is unclean but it doesn’t cause the hullin to become unclean because it is not wet (as we learned in yesterday’s mishnah).

Mishnah Two 
A seah of unclean terumah which fell into a hundred of clean hullin:
1) Rabbi Eliezer says: [a seah] must be taken out and burnt, for I say that the seah taken out is the one that fell in. 
2) But the sages say: it may be taken out and eaten in small quantities, or roasted, or kneaded with fruit juice, or divided into pieces of dough so that the size of one egg be not in any one place.

Explanation
Section one: Rabbi Eliezer holds that the seah of terumah has to be taken out but that it can’t be eaten because we assume that the seah that is taken out is the seah of terumah that fell in and was unclean. 
Section two: The other rabbis hold that when the seah of terumah fell into the pile of 100 seahs of hullin it was nullified in the pile, so when he took a seah out we don’t assume that it is the same one that fell in. However, there is still 1/100 parts of the pile that is unclean and therefore part of that which he takes out is unclean. In order to prevent the unclean part from impurifying the clean part he must eat it in the same way described in the end of yesterday’s mishnah. 
We should note that what he gives to the priest is not actually terumah, for if it were, the priest wouldn’t be able to eat it—unclean terumah is forbidden. The portion that the person takes out of the pile and gives to the priest is hullin that replaces the terumah owed to him. Unclean hullin can be eaten, however in this case since the priest received the seah in place of terumah owed to him, he must preserve its purity and eat it so that it doesn’t all become impure.
