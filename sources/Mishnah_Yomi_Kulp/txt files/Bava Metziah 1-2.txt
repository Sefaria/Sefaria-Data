
Mishnah Two
1) If two men were riding on an animal, or one was riding and the other was leading the animal, and one of them said, “The animal is all mine”, and the other said “It is all mine.”, they each swear that they don’t own less than half of the animal and they split it.  
2) If after the case is settled, they both admit to the others claim, or if there are witnesses they can split the animal without an oath.

Explanation
This mishnah is similar to the previous mishnah and just deals with a different disputed object.  In the second clause the mishnah states that if they agree to the other party’s claim or if there are witnesses that the animal is owned by both parties, they split the animal without an oath.  The function of the oath is to ensure that the person is telling the truth.  When there is no dispute, or when there are witnesses who testify, there is no need for an oath.  Since it is preferable to avoid oaths altogether the two may split the animal without an oath.

Questions for Further Thought: 
 Mishnah two: After having learned the first mishnah, why do we need the second mishnah?  You may want to consider the difference between objects, which we learned about in the first mishnah, and animals, which we learn about here.
