Shabbat, Chapter Six, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
At the end of yesterday’s mishnah we learned that a Medean woman may wear her cloak on Shabbat.  We explained that these cloaks were tied with a stone, nut or coin.  Today’s mishnah is based on that ruling.

Mishnah Seven
A woman may weight [her cloak] with a stone, nut, or coin, providing that she does not attach the weight in the first place on Shabbat.

Explanation
As we learned yesterday, a woman may wear a cloak that is tied with one of these things.  However, she may not attach the weight itself on Shabbat.  The Talmud explains that this prohibition refers only to the coin. Since coins may not be handled on Shabbat (they are muktzeh) she may not tie her cloak with one.  However, if the tie was made before Shabbat she may wear the cloak.  According to the Talmud she may make the tie with a nut or stone even on Shabbat.
