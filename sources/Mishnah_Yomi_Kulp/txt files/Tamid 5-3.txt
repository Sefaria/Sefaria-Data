Tamid, Chapter Five, Mishnah Three

Introduction
The lotteries are now over, the winners have won and the losers, well, they have not won. Our mishnah discusses what those who did not win any lottery do.

Mishnah Three
1) He then handed them over to the attendants, who stripped them of their garments, and they would leave on them only the pants.   
2) There were windows there on which was inscribed the name of the garment to which each was assigned.

Explanation
Section one: The superintendent would now turn over to the Temple attendants the priests who had not won any lottery. The attendants would strip the priests of the special clothes that they wore to work in the Temple, leaving on only their pants, so that they wouldn’t be standing there naked. After they would put on their regular clothing, they could remove the priestly pants and put on regular pants as well.
Section two: There were windows in the Temple into which the priests could put their clothes. Each piece of clothing would have its own slot. This would save sorting the laundry later on, a job that I too find most cumbersome.
