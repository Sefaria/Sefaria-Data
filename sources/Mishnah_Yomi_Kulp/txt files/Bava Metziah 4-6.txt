Mishnah Six
1) Until when may he [that is defrauded] return the coin?
a) In large towns until he has had time to show it to a money-changer.
b) In villages until the Sabbath eve.
2) If he [that had given the coin] recognized it, even after twelve months he should accept it [in return], but [if he does not accept it the one who received it] only has a cause for complaint [against him].
3) And it is permitted to use it for redeeming the Second Tithe without concern, for [he who would not receive it] is but only a cheapskate.

Explanation
If a person should receive a fraudulent coin (one that weighs less than it is supposed to), he may demand that the person who gave him the coin replace it with a better coin.  However, there is a time limit for making such a demand.  In large towns where money-changers who could check the coin would be found, he only has as much time as it would take to bring it to a money-changer.  In small towns he has until the eve of the Sabbath, since it can be assumed that most people from small towns will visit the market and see money-changers before the Sabbath.
If the person who gave him the coin recognized the coin he should exchange it even after the time mentioned above has long lapsed.  However, if he refuses to exchange the coin the person who received it has no legal claim against him.  The most he has is the right to make a formal complaint, which may damage the reputation of the person who gave the coin but will not legally compel him to exchange the coin.
Finally the mishnah teaches that one may redeem his Second Tithe with this coin, since anyone who would not accept the coin is only being cheap.  The Second Tithe was the second ten percent of a person’s produce.  It had to be brought to Jerusalem and eaten there.  Since it was difficult to carry all of the produce itself to Jerusalem a person was allowed to redeem the produce with money, and then bring the money to Jerusalem to use it to buy food.
