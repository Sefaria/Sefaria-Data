Peah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah teaches that there is a difference in what divides a field between a field planted with seeds from which crops grow (mostly grain and beans) and a field of trees.

Mishnah Three
1) All of these divide in the case of a field [planted] with seeds, but in the case of trees nothing divides except a fence.   
2) Should the branches intertwine [on top of the fence], then it does not divide and he gives one peah for the whole field.

Explanation
Section one:  All of the things in the above two mishnayot divide fields that are planted with seeds, but they do not divide fields with trees.  The only thing that divides a field of trees is a fence. The reason for this seems to be that fields with trees customarily have large spaces between trees. There is always some fallow land.  In contrast, crops such as wheat and barley are grown closely together and hence a fallow patch or a stream would serve to divide the field.  
Section two:  Even a fence doesn’t divide a field of trees if the branches of the field are intertwined on top of the fence.  Since the trees are intertwined with one another, we consider it to be one field.
