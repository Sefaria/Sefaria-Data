Parah, Chapter Eleven, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
Our chapter concludes with a mishnah as to how much hyssop was needed to sprinkle the water.

Mishnah Nine
1) The mitzvah of the hyssop: it should have three stalks bearing three buds. 
a) Rabbi Judah says: each stalk should have three buds. 
2) Hyssop that consists of a growth of three stalks should be cut apart and then bound together. 
a) If the stalks were cut apart but were not bound together, or if they were bound together but were not cut apart, or if they were neither cut apart nor bound together, they are nevertheless valid. 
3) Rabbi Yose says: the mitzvah of the hyssop is that it should have three stalks, and on them three buds, but its remnants need only have two, while its stumps may be of the smallest size.

Explanation
Section one: Each stalk of hyssop should have at least one budding flower. I would suggest googling "hyssop" to see what this looks like. Rabbi Judah says that each of the three stalks should have three budding flowers.
Section two: The hyssop stalks are separated at their base and then bound together. We should note that Numbers 19:18, the verse that prescribes hyssop for sprinkling the hatat waters, does not mention that the hyssop should be bound. However, Exodus 12:22, the verse that describes applying the blood to the doorposts in Egypt, does refer to bound hyssop. It seems that our mishnah applies the notion of binding in that context to our context. In order to bind something, it would first have to be separated. Thus the hyssop should first be separated and then bound.  However, if either or even neither of these steps is taken, the sprinkling is still valid. 
Section three: Rabbi Yose agrees with the opinion in section one. He adds that if one of the stalks fell away, even two are valid. Finally, if all that is left of the stalks or buds is even the smallest measure, it is still valid.
