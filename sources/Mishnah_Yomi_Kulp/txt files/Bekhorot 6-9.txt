Bekhorot, Chapter Six, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
This mishnah lists a few additional blemishes which disqualify the first born.

Mishnah Nine
1) It happened that the lower jaw [of a first born] was larger than the upper jaw. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel asked the sages [for a ruling] and they said: this is a blemish.
2) The ear of a kid which was doubled: the sages ruled: if it is all one bone, it is a blemish, but if it is not all one bone, it is not a blemish.
3) Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel says: if the tail of a kid is like that of a pig, or if the tail does not possess three vertebrae, this is a blemish.

Explanation
Section one: In this case an animal seems to be blemished, but Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel is not sure if the blemish is sufficient to disqualify it. He brings the animal in front of the other sages and they rule that it is a blemish and it is disqualified.
Section two: If the kid seems to have one ear inside of another ear, the kid is considered blemished if the ear has only one “bone” meaning one ear lobe. This would seem to refer to a case where the external lobe was bent over and turned into the internal ear. However, if the “bone” (the lobe) is split at the top, the animal is not blemished. We should note that the reason for this is unclear and indeed the Rambam has a different and opposite version of the mishnah: if it is one bone it is blemished but if it is not one bone, it is not blemished. 
Section three: If a kid’s tail looks like a pig’s tail, or does not have the full three vertebrae, the animal is blemished.
