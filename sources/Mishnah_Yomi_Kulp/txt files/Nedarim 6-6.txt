Nedarim, Chapter Six, Mishnah Six

Introduction
The first part of our mishnah discusses what is prohibited when one vows to abstain from meat.  The second part of the mishnah discusses the problem of a forbidden food (in this case forbidden through a vow) becoming mixed up with other permitted foods.  

Mishnah Six
1) He who vows [abstinence] from meat may eat broth and meat sediment.  
a) But Rabbi Judah prohibits. 
2) Rabbi Judah said: it once happened that Rabbi Tarfon prohibited me from eating [even the] eggs boiled [with the meat]. 
a) They replied:  That is so.  When is this true? When he says “This meat is prohibited to me.” For if one vows [to abstain] from something, and it is mixed up with another thing, if there is a sufficient [amount of the prohibited food] to impart its taste [to the other] it  is forbidden.

Explanation
Section one:  One who vows not to eat meat, may still eat broth and the pieces of meat that stick to the pot (meat sediment) for those are not considered to be what the person intended when he vowed to abstain from “meat”.  
Rabbi Judah says that even the broth and meat sediment are prohibited.
Section two:  To support his opinion, Rabbi Judah tells a story of how Rabbi Tarfon prohibited him from having even the eggs boiled with the meat.  The reason is that the eggs had absorbed some of the taste of the meat.  If even the eggs are prohibited, obviously the broth and the meat sediment should be prohibited as well.
The Sages respond that the case where Rabbi Tarfon prohibited the eggs proves their point, for in that case the person said “This meat is prohibited to me” and not “Konam, the meat that I eat.”  In the former case, he may not eat anything that has the taste of the prohibited meat, including the eggs cooked with it.  However, in the latter case, his intention was to abstain only from things called “meat” and not from broth or meat sediments.
