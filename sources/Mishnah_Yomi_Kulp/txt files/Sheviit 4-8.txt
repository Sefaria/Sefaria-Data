Sheviit, Chapter Four, Mishnah Eight

Introduction
This mishnah continues to deal with when in its development may one eat fruit growing during the sabbatical year.  Basically this mishnah is the same as yesterday’s and therefore does not need any further explanation.

Mishnah Eight
1) Unripe grapes: as soon as they contain juice he may eat them with bread in the field. When they have begun to ripen, he may take them home. 
2) And similarly in the other years of the sabbatical cycle [when they have reached this latter stage] they are subject to tithes.
