Introduction to Hagigah

Tractate Hagigah deals with the three sacrifices that according to the rabbis a person had to bring on all three festivals, Sukkot, Pesah and Shavuot.  
The first of these sacrifices is called the “Hagigah.”  The rabbis derived the concept of the Hagigah from the word “hag” used in the context of the three festivals.  According to the rabbis, every person had to bring on the first day of the festival a Hagigah.  If they could not offer it on the first day, then they could bring it for the remaining seven days. The Hagigah is a type of thanksgiving sacrifice; some of the meat went to the owners and some of the fats were offered on the altar.
The second type of sacrifice is a celebratory thanksgiving offering. This is meant to fulfill the commandment to celebrate on the festival (Deuteronomy 16:14).   Celebrating means eating meat (sorry if you’re a vegetarian).  People were supposed to eat these thanksgiving offerings for all seven days.    
The third sacrifice is called a “re’eyah” which means “to be seen.”  Deuteronomy 16:16 says that all males must “be seen” at the Temple three times a year, on the three festivals.  The rabbis understood that they were not to be seen empty-handed, but rather they had to bring a sacrifice.  This sacrifice is a whole burnt offering, an olah.   
Tractate Hagigah deals mostly with these three sacrifices.  Along the way there are some fascinating mishnayot that deal with sacrifices and purity and shed much light on certain historical aspects of the Second Temple and Mishnaic periods.  While some of these mishnayot may be a little difficult to understand, those who persist in learning them will find them quite intriguing.
