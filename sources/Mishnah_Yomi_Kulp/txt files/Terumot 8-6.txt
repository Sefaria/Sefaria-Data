Terumot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Six

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with fruit and animals that may have been bitten by a snake.

Mishnah Six 
1) Figs, grapes, cucumbers, pumpkins, melons or watermelons that have bite marks, even if they are in a jar, both large or small, both plucked or still attached to the soil, they are forbidden as long as there is juice in them.   
2) [An animal] bitten by a snake is forbidden on account of the danger to life. 

Explanation
Section one: Any fruit that has a bite mark on it, one that could have come from a snake, is forbidden. The fear is that the snake left some poison in the fruit and the moisture that remains in the fruit will convey the poison to all parts of the fruit. That is why the mishnah says “as long as there is juice in them.” If the fruit is dry, then they can get rid of the part near the bite and safely eat the rest (I’m not necessarily recommending this at home). The prohibition holds true even if the fruit is in a jar, because it may have been bitten before it was put in the jar. It also holds true no matter the size of the fruit, or whether it is still attached to the ground. 
Section two: If an animal was bitten by a snake, it is prohibited to eat that animal because of the danger to one’s life.
