Nazir, Chapter Three, Mishnah Five

Introduction
As we have already mentioned, if a nazirite becomes impure, he must bring a sacrifice and begin to recount his naziriteship.  Our mishnah deals with a person who takes a nazirite vow while he is in a graveyard, a place of high impurity.  

Mishnah Five
1) If one takes a nazirite vow while in a graveyard, then even if he remains there for thirty days, these do not count, and he does not have to bring the sacrifice [prescribed] for impurity. 
2) If he leaves it and re-enters, [the period]  counts, and he must bring the sacrifice [prescribed] for impurity. 
a) Rabbi Eliezer says: not [if he re-enters] on the same day, for it says, “But the former days shall be void,” (Numbers 6:12)  until there are former days.

Explanation
Section one:  This person took a nazirite vow while standing in a place of impurity.  Therefore he cannot even begin to count the days of his naziriteship.  As long as he stays in the place of impurity he has not yet become a nazirite.  Therefore, he also does not need to bring a sacrifice of impurity, which he would have been obligated for, had he been a nazirite and then became impure.  
Section two:  However, if he leaves the graveyard, and then becomes pure (which takes seven days) he now begins to count the days of naziriteship.  If after he leaves he re-enters the graveyard, he is now a nazirite who has become impure and is obligated to bring the requisite sacrifices. 
Rabbi Eliezer holds that if he returns to the graveyard (or is otherwise made impure) the same day that he began to count his naziriteship, the day is not lost and he does not bring impurity sacrifices.  After he becomes pure, he goes on counting from where he left off.  This halakhah is derived by means of a midrash on the word “days”.  In order to void that part of the naziriteship which was previously observed, there must have been full days which were observed.
