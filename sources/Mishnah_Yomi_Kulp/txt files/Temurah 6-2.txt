Temurah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Two

Introduction
According to Deuteronomy 23:19 one may not bring “a prostitute’s fee or the pay of a dog into the house of the Lord.” The rabbis understand these two things to be an animal used to pay a prostitute or an ox used as payment for a dog. Neither of them can be used as a sacrifice.
The next three mishnayot explain what constitutes the “a prostitute’s fee” or “the pay of a dog.” 

Mishnah Two 
What is meant by “a prostitute’s fee”? 
1) If one says to a prostitute, “Take this lamb as your fee,” even if there are a hundred lambs, they are all forbidden [for the altar]. 
2) If one says to his fellow: Here is a lamb and have your female slave sleep with my servant, 
a) Rabbi Meir says: it [the lamb] is not regarded as a prostitute’s fee.
b) But the sages say: it is regarded as a prostitute’s fee.

Explanation
Section one: According to Albeck, this means that a man gives even 100 lambs to a prostitute as her fee, none of the lambs can be used as a sacrifice. The Talmud adds that even if her stated fee was only one lamb and he gave her another 99 lambs as a bonus, they are all prohibited. 
Section two:  A slave owner has a right to give his female Canaanite(non-Jewish)  slave to his male Hebrew slave. Rabbi Meir says that if someone tries to pay another slave owner for him to have his female slave sleep with his male slave, it is not prostitution and the fee is not a prostitute’s fee. According to Rabbi Meir the reason is that a Hebrew slave cannot marry a female Canaanite slave, therefore the master has a right to designate her to have relations with someone not for the sake of marriage. The other sages hold that he could marry her and therefore when she is paid to have relations with him it is a prostitute’s fee.
