Orlah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
In yesterday’s mishnah, the terumah leaven fell into already-leavened dough before the dough had begun to ferment, and therefore, since the terumah leaven may have sped up the fermenting process, the dough was prohibited. In today’s mishnah, the leaven falls in after the dough has already been fermented. 

Mishnah Nine
1) If leaven of hullin has fallen into dough and caused it to ferment, and after that there fell in leaven of terumah or of kilayim of the vineyard, and there was enough to cause fermentation, [the dough] is prohibited.
2) But Rabbi Shimon permits it.

Explanation
Section one: According to the first opinion, it doesn’t matter that the terumah leaven fell into the dough after the dough had already been fermented. The forbidden leaven will still increase the fermentation of the dough and therefore, the entire dough becomes prohibited.
Section two: Rabbi Shimon, on the other hand, holds that the dough is permitted. One explanation for Rabbi Shimon’s opinion is that he holds that extra leaven will not improve the taste of the dough, but rather make it taste worse. Since this taste is undesirable, it does not cause the dough to be prohibited. In yesterday’s mishnah, the leaven terumah improved the taste of the dough because it had not yet been fermented, therefore, Rabbi Shimon would agree that the dough is prohibited.
