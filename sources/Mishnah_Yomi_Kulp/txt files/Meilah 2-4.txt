Meilah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Today’s mishnah deals with the animal olah. 

Mishnah Four
1) The law of sacrilege applies to an olah from the moment of its dedication. 
2) When it is slaughtered it becomes susceptible to be disqualified through contact with a tevul yom or one who still requires atonement, or by remaining overnight. 
3) Once its blood has been sprinkled it is subject to [the laws of] piggul, notar and defilement;
4) And the law of sacrilege does not apply to its hide, but it does apply to it flesh until [the ashes have been] removed [from the altar] to the place of the ashes.

Explanation
Sections one-three: See mishnah two.
Section four: Immediately after it is slaughtered, the hide belongs to the priest. Therefore, the law of sacrilege stops applying to the hide. However, the law of sacrilege continues to apply to its flesh, which is not eaten by the priest. It only stops when the flesh is removed from the altar and brought to the place of ashes.
