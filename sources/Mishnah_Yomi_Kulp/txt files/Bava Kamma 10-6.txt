Bava Kamma Chapter Ten Mishna Six

Mishnah Six
1) If a man stole something from his friend in an inhabited region or borrowed it or received it as a deposit, he may not return it to him in the wilderness.
a) But if he [had borrowed it or received it] with the understanding that he was going out to the wilderness, he may return it to him in the wilderness.  

Explanation
Our mishnah teaches that if a person receives something from another person in an inhabited region, whether he stole it, borrowed it or received it as a deposit, he may not return it to him in the wilderness, by definition an uninhabited region.  Receiving something in the wilderness is probably undesirable for the owner, since he will have to shlepp the object all the way home.  Furthermore, there is a greater danger of bandits and wild animals in the wilderness, and therefore a person would prefer to have his object returned in an inhabited, protected area.  However, if it was known that the person receiving the loan or borrowing the object was going out to the wilderness, than he has a right to return it to the owner in the wilderness.
