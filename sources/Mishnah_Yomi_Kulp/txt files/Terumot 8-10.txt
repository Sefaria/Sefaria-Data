Terumot, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Ten

Introduction
This mishnah contains a very similar scenario to the mishnah we learned yesterday. 

Mishnah Ten
1) Similarly a jar of [terumah] oil which spilled: 
a) Both Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua agree that if he can save at least a reviit in purity he should save it; 
2) But if not:
a) Rabbi Eliezer says: let it flow down and be swallowed up by the ground, and let him not make it unclean with his own hands.

Explanation
Section one: In this case a jar of pure terumah oil fall on the ground and it will take time for him to get clean vessels to scoop it up. The choice is to let the oil seep into the ground or to pick it up with unclean vessels. Again, both agree that if he can save at least a reviit, he should do so, even though most will be lost. The reason is that he should do whatever he can to save the purity of the pure terumah.
Note that they do not disagree with regard to a situation in which the oil is in the upper part of an oil press and it will flow down into a vat impure hullin oil, thereby making the entire mixture impure medumma (terumah mixed in with hullin). The reason is that such impure medumma oil can be burned, and therefore the loss is not so great. In such a situation all would agree that he should just let the pure terumah oil flow into the impure hullin oil. This is different from the scenario in yesterday’s mishnah where there is no use for impure medumma wine.
Section two: Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua again disagree if there is no other way to save the oil besides using the unclean vessels. Rabbi Eliezer says that he may not use the unclean vessels and he should rather just let the whole mixture go to waste. Rabbi Joshua’s response is in tomorrow’s mishnah. I’m sure the suspense is just killing you.
