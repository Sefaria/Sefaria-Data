Menahot, Chapter Five, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
This mishnah continues to teach the differences between how different menahot (pl. of minhah) are prepared.

Mishnah Nine
1) [If a man said,] “I take upon myself [to offer a minhah baked] in an oven,” he must not bring what is baked in a stove or on tiles or in the cauldrons of the Arabs.    
a) Rabbi Judah says: he may bring what is baked in a stove. 
2) [If he said,] “I take upon myself [to offer] a baked minhah,” he may not bring half in loaves and half in wafers.    
a) Rabbi Shimon permits it for it is one kind.

Explanation
Section one: Leviticus 2:4 refers to a minhah baked in an oven. According to the first opinion, this means that the minhah must actually be baked inside an oven. This used to be done by placing the loaf on the sides of the hot oven where it would be baked, similar to the way in which pita is still made. He is not allowed to cook it on a stove or on tiles, or in the type of cauldrons that Arabs at the time of the Mishnah used to prepare their bread. These were holes dug in the ground, lined with plaster and then heated up to bake bread.
Rabbi Judah says that when the Torah specifies a “minhah baked in an oven” it includes a minhah baked on a stove.
Section two: Leviticus 2:4 refers to loaves of matzah and matzah wafers. The mishnah interprets this to mean that the minhah can be brought either as loaves of matzah or matzah wafers. One cannot bring half as loaves and half as wafers. 
Rabbi Shimon says that since both the loaves and wafers are both “one kind” meaning they are essentially the same, one can bring half of his minhah as loaves and half as wafers.
