Hallah, Chapter Two, Mishnah Six

Introduction 
This mishnah teaches the basic law that we have encountered several times—1 ¼ kav of flour is liable for hallah. If there is less, one need not remove hallah.

Mishnah Six
1) Five-fourths [of a kav] of flour are subject to hallah. 
2) If their leaven, their light bran and their coarse bran [make up the] five-fourths, they are subject.
3) If their coarse bran had been removed from them and returned to them, they are exempt. 

Explanation
Section one: This is the basic law, to which we have made reference on several occasions.
Section two: When measuring the flour, one includes the leaven (the starter dough used to leaven the bread), and all of the bran. 
Section three: If the coarse bran was removed, which is typical in the processing of better quality flour, and then it was added back in, the flour is not subject to hallah. This is because putting back the course bran is unusual.
