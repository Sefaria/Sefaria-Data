Zevahim, Chapter Three, Mishnah Five

Introduction
This mishnah deals with offspring, eggs and milk and their status vis a vis the sacrifice as a whole.

Mishnah Five
1) If one slaughters sacred animals [intending] to eat the fetus or the afterbirth outside [of the place or time where the animal must be eaten], he does not render it piggul. 
2) If one plucks off [the necks of] doves, [intending] to eat their eggs outside [of the place or time where the animal must be eaten], he does not render [them] piggul. 
3) The milk of sacred animals or the eggs of doves—one is not liable for eating them in respect of piggul, remnant, or uncleanness.

Explanation
Section one: The fetus and the afterbirth are not considered integral parts of the sacrificial animal. Therefore, if one slaughters an animal with an improper intention concerning eating its fetus or afterbirth the sacrifice is not rendered invalid. 
Section two: Birds are slaughtered by having their heads plucked off. We will learn about this more later. Our mishnah teaches that if one has an improper intention concerning eating the eggs, this does not render the sacrifice invalid. The eggs are not part of the bird.
Section three: The milk of a mammal and the eggs of a bird are not considered part of the animal in respect of sacrificial laws. Therefore, the laws of piggul, remnant and uncleanness do not apply to them—see yesterday’s mishnah for a discussion of these three laws.
