Mishnah Five
1) If he sold it all but a hundredth part, or if he had [already] a share in it, or if slaughtered it and it became unfit [to eat] by his own hand, or if he pierced the windpipe or rooted out its gullet, he makes twofold restitution but not fourfold or fivefold restitution.
2) If he stole it in the owner’s domain, but slaughtered it or sold it outside the owner’s domain, 
a) or if he stole it outside the owner’s domain and slaughtered or sold it within the owner’s domain;
b) or if he stole it and slaughtered or sold it within the owner’s domain;
c) or if he stole it and slaughtered or sold it outside the owner’s domain, 
d) he must make fourfold or fivefold restitution.
e) But if he stole it and slaughtered or sold it within the owner’s domain, he is exempt.

Explanation
Section one deals with several different scenarios in which a thief will not be obligated for fourfold or fivefold restitution.  First of all, if he sells only part of the animal, and even if he sells is 99% of the animal, he is still exempt.  Second, if he steals something that he already owns part of, for instance he steals from his partner, he is exempt.  Third, if the slaughtering causes the animal to become unfit to eat, because it was not done properly, he is exempt.  Piercing the animals windpipe or tearing out its gullet makes the animal not kosher and therefore the thief is only obligated for twofold restitution.
Section two teaches that if both the stealing and the slaughtering or selling were done on the property of the owner, the thief has never acquired the animal in order to make him obligated.  In order to become a thief a person must take possession of the object.  If he did not do so, he is not considered a thief and he will not be obligated as such.  We will learn more details about this law in tomorrow’s mishnah.
