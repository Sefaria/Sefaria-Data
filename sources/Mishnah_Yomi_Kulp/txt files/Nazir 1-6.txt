Nazir, Chapter One, Mishnah Six

Introduction
In mishnah three we learned that if one says “Behold I am a nazirite from here until the end of the world” he is a nazirite for only thirty days, because he did not specify the length of his vow.  Our mishnah teaches that if he does specify the place to which he refers, he may be a nazirite for as long as it takes to get to such and such a place.

Mishnah Six
[If one says,] “Behold, I am a nazirite, as [long as it takes to get] from here to such and such a place,” we estimate the number of days [journey] from here to the place mentioned. 
If this is less than thirty days, he becomes a nazirite for thirty days; 
Otherwise he becomes a nazirite for that number of days.

Explanation
In this case, the court simply estimates how long it would take to get from the place where he vows to the place that he mentions.  If it would take less than thirty days, then he is a nazirite for thirty days.  As we have noted, one can never be a nazirite for less than thirty days.  However, if it takes longer, then he is a nazirite for however many days it takes to get to that place.
