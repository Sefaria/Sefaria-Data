Yevamoth, Chapter Four, Mishnah One

Introduction
This mishnah discusses the case where a yavam performs halitzah, but then the woman who had halitzah is found to be pregnant with the dead husband’s child.

Mishnah One
A yavam performs halitzah for his yevamah, and she is subsequently found to be pregnant and she gives birth:
1) If the child is viable, he is permitted to marry her relatives and she is permitted to marry his relatives, and he does not disqualify her from marrying a priest.  
2) If the child is not viable, he is forbidden to marry her relatives and she is forbidden to marry his relatives, and he disqualifies her from marrying a priest.

Explanation
Section one:  If the child is viable, meaning there was no miscarriage, then the halitzah was unnecessary, because only a husband who has no children cause his wives to be subject to yibbum.  Since the halitzah was not necessary, all of the results of a man performing halitzah for a woman do not occur.  He is permitted to marry her relatives and she is permitted to his relatives [mishnah 7 below will list which relatives are forbidden had the halitzah been necessary].  Furthermore, since the halitzah was unnecessary, she is not disqualified from subsequently marrying a priest, as a regular halutzah (a woman who has had halitzah is).  
Section two:  If the child was not viable, meaning she had a miscarriage, then the halitzah was necessary.  Therefore, all of the results of a valid halitzah do occur.  He is forbidden to marry her relatives and she may not marry his.  She is considered a halutzah, and therefore she can no longer marry a priest.
