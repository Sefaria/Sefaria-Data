Explanation—Mishnah Six
This mishnah deals with how much warning a landlord must give his tenant before evicting him.  
Section one:  If he rented him a house in the winter, he cannot evict him from Sukkot (approximately October) till Pesach (approximately April).  In Israel, where the Mishnah was composed, this is the rainy season.  Since it would be difficult for the tenant to find a new house in the rainy season, and difficult for him to move while it is wet outside, he may not be evicted during this entire period.
If it was during the summer and the house was rented in a small town, he need give him only 30 days warning before evicting him.  If, however, he was in a large city he must give him 12 months warning.  The assumption is that it will be more difficult to find new housing in a larger city where more people live.
Section two:  If he rented him a store he must always give him twelve months, even during the summer in a small town (where if he had rented him a house he need only give thirty days warning). The reason is that a storekeeper needs time to collect his debts from his customers.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel points out that bakers and dyers will need three years warning.  A likely reason for the need for such a long warning is that it is very difficult for a baker or dyer to move his equipment and find new accommodations.
