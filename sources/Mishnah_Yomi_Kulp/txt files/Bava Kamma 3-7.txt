Bava Kamma Chapter Three Mishnayoth Seven



Mishnah Seven
[If] a man was splitting wood in the private domain and injured anyone in the public domain,
or if he was in the public domain and injured anyone in the private domain,
or if he was in a private domain and injured anyone in another private domain, 
he is liable.

Explanation
Mishnah seven teaches that if a person while chopping wood damages another person, no matter where the chopping is done and no matter where the damages are done, the wood-chopper is liable.

Questions for Further Thought:
 Based on mishnah seven, would you think a person would be liable if while chopping wood on his own property he damages someone who has entered his property?
