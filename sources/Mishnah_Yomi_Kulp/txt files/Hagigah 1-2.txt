Hagigah, Chapter One, Mishnah Two

Introduction
In this mishnah the two houses debate the minimum value of the pilgrimage offering and the hagigah offering.  These two offerings were explained in the introduction to the tractate.

Mishnah Two
Bet Shammai say: the pilgrimage-offering (re’eyah) must be worth [at least] two pieces of silver and the hagigah one piece (ma’ah) of silver.   
But Bet Hillel say: the pilgrimage-offering must be worth [at least] one ma'ah of silver and the hagigah two pieces of silver.

Explanation
The pilgrimage offering is an olah, a wholly burnt offering, whereas the hagigah is a shelamim, a thanksgiving offering, part eaten by the priests, part by its owners and part offered on the altar.  According to Bet Shammai the sacrifice that is completely for God, the pilgrimage offering, is the more expensive offering.  If we extrapolate, we might say that when a person has a limited budget, he should spend more on God than on himself.  
Bet Hillel holds the opposite—the hagigah offering, eaten by people, is to be the more expensive offering.  Extrapolating again, Bet Hillel seems to put humans at the center, focusing on enriching their religious experience by providing them more food.
