Mishnah Eight 
1) [If] blood of unblemished animals [was mixed] with blood of blemished animals, it must be poured out into the duct. 
2) [If] a goblet [of valid blood was mixed up] with other goblets [of invalid blood]:   
a) Rabbi Eliezer said: if he [the priest] offered [sprinkled] one goblet, all the goblets can be offered;   
b) But the sages say: even if they offered all of them save one, it must be poured out into the duct.

Explanation
Section one: Blood of blemished animals cannot be spilled on the altar, therefore this mixture must be dumped out into the duct. 
Section two: Here, instead of the blood being mixed up, goblets of blood are mixed up. Some of these goblets have the valid blood from unblemished animals and one has the invalid blood of a blemished animal. All of the sages seem to agree that all of the goblets should be spilled out into the duct. They debate what should be done if one of the goblets had already had its blood sprinkled. According to Rabbi Eliezer, we can treat this like the situation with the mixed up limbs in mishnah five. If one of the goblets’ contents has been sprinkled, we can assume that the rest of the goblets are those containing valid blood and their blood can be sprinkled. The sages disagree, as they did above in mishnah five, and say that in all circumstances all of the blood must be poured out into the duct.
