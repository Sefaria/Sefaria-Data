Eruvin, Chapter One, Mishnah Seven

Introduction
This mishnah discusses the material which can be used to make the side-posts.

Mishnah Seven
1) One may make the side-posts out of anything, even something that is alive.
a) But Rabbi Yose prohibits this. 
2) It also causes defilement as the covering of a tomb, 
a) But Rabbi Meir makes pure. 
3) One may write on them gittin, 
a) But Rabbi Yose the Galilean declares it unfit.

Explanation
Section one:  According to the first opinion, one may use even an animal to make the side-post.  The animal would have to be tied in place, so that it couldn’t wander away.  Similarly, one can, according to some opinions, use an animal to make a wall of a sukkah. We have seen several similarities between the laws of setting up the cross-beam and side-post and the sukkah.   
Rabbi Yose prohibits using an animal, lest it dies and become less than the required ten handbreadths high. 
Section two:  If one used an animal to cover a tomb, the animal will convey ritual defilement, as do all coverings of tombs.  The tomb described here was not in the ground, as tombs usually are today, but a cave in the side of a hill.  The animal must be tied to the tomb in order for it to be considered a tomb covering.
Rabbi Meir holds that anything that is alive cannot transmit impurity if used as a tomb covering.  Therefore, one who touches an animal used to cover a tomb is still pure.  
Section three:  One can write a get on animal, for instance on the horn of a cow, and then divorce one’s wife by giving her the cow (see Gittin 2:3).  Rabbi Yose the Galilean says that such a get is invalid because it is not like a scroll, specifically mentioned as the divorce document in Deuteronomy 24:3.
