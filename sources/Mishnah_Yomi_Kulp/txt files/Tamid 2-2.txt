Mishnah Two
1) They then began to throw the ashes on to the heap (tapuah).   
a) This heap was in the middle of the altar, and sometimes there was as much as three hundred kor on it. 
2) On festivals they did not use to clear away the ash because it was reckoned an ornament to the altar.   
3) It never happened that the priest was neglectful in taking out the ashes.  

Explanation
Section one: After having cleared the limbs and pieces of fat, the other priests would take the ashes still on the altar and heap them onto the middle of the altar, onto a place called the “tapuah.” The pile of ashes on the tapuah could get quite high, as the mishnah testifies. However, when the tapuah began to overflow with ash, they would remove all of it and take it out of the city. 
Section two: On festivals they let the ash heap grow even higher because by seeing the massive amounts of ashes, people could tell how many sacrifices had been offered. The large ash-heap was considered to be ornamental to the altar.
Section three: This section relates to the previous one. One might have thought that they neglected to clear away the ashes during the festival, perhaps because they were so busy with other matters. To dash this thought, the mishnah notes that the priests never neglected the duty of taking the ashes off of the altar. They left the ashes on the altar during the festival out of intention and not neglect.
