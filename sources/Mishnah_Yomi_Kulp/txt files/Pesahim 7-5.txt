Pesahim, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Our mishnah deals with cases where the congregation of Israel is pure but part of the pesah sacrifice has become unclean.
 
Mishnah Five
1) If the flesh was defiled while the fat remained [clean], he may not sprinkle the blood but if the fat was defiled while the flesh has remained [clean], he must sprinkle the blood. 
2) But in the case of [other] dedicated sacrifices it is not so, rather even if the flesh was defiled while the fat has remained clean, he must sprinkle the blood. 

Explanation 
Section one:  If the flesh was defiled but the fat which is supposed to be burned on the altar remains clean he cannot sprinkle the blood on the altar.  Since the pesah’s main purpose is to be eaten, if the flesh cannot be eaten the sacrifice is not valid and the blood cannot be sprinkled.  In the opposite case, if the fat has been defiled and the flesh remains pure, the fat cannot be burned on the altar but the blood can still be sprinkled. Since the main purpose of the pesah is to be eaten, as long as the flesh can be eaten the blood can be sprinkled.
Section two:  Other sacrifices are different.  Since their main purpose is to be sacrificed and not necessarily to be eaten, their blood may be sprinkled in either case.  If the flesh becomes impure the blood is sprinkled in order to allow the fat to be burned on the altar.  If the fat becomes impure, the blood is sprinkled in order to allow the flesh to be eaten.
