Mishnah Three
1) If a woman aborted a sac full of water, full of blood, or full of pieces of flesh, she need not be concerned that it was a birth.
2) But if its limbs were fashioned she must sit for both male and female.

Explanation
Section one: These sacs do not count as births (see Bekhorot 8:1). We don't assume that there was a fetus in them.
Section two: If limbs are noticeable in the shape within the sac, then we must be concerned that this was actually a fetus. Assuming that the gender is unknown, the woman must act stringently in both directions, as we explained in yesterday's mishnah.
