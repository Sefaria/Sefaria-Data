Terumot, Chapter Ten, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Both the seeds and the stalk of fenugreek can impart flavor to something they are mixed in with. This mishnah deels with fenugreek which falls into a vat of wine.

Mishnah Five
Fenugreek which fell into a vat of wine: 
1) If it was terumah or second tithe and there is in the seed alone without the stalk sufficient to impart a flavor [it is forbidden].   
2) But if it was seventh year produce or mixed seeds in vineyards, or dedicated produce, [it is forbidden] if in both seed and stalk there is sufficient to impart a flavor.

Explanation
Section one: If the fenugreek which falls into the wine is of terumah or second tithe, then there needs to be enough fenugreek seed to impart flavor to the wine to make it prohibited. In this case we ignore the stalk. This is because the stalk of the fenugreek is not considered to be “kadosh” as far as terumah and second tithe are concerned—only the seed is considered to be kadosh. Therefore, the stalk can’t cause the wine to be prohibited.
Section two: However, when it comes to fenugreek that grew in the seventh year, or grew in a vineyard, or was dedicated to the Temple, in all of these cases the laws apply to the stalks the same way that they apply to the seeds. Therefore, if the stalks and seeds together impart a taste, then the wine takes on the laws of the fenugreek. If the fenugreek was seventh year produce, then the wine must be treated as seventh year wine and it can be drunk only while grapes are found in the field. If the fenugreek is from mixed seeds, then the wine is prohibited. If it was dedicated to the Temple, then the wine too must be given to the Temple.
