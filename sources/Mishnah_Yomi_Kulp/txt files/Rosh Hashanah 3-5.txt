Rosh Hashanah, Chapter Three, Mishnah Five

Introduction
Leviticus 25:8-16 deals with the Jubilee year, the fiftieth year after seven cycles of seven years.  Verse 9 states, “Then you shall sound the horn loud; in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month—the Day of Atonement—you shall have the horn sounded throughout your land.”  Our mishnah deals with the rituals of this day which begins the Jubilee year.  

Mishnah Five
1) The Jubilee is the same as Rosh Hashanah when it comes to blowing [the shofar] and blessings.   
2) Rabbi Judah says: on Rosh Hashanah they blow with [a shofar of] rams and on Jubilees with [a shofar] of ibex.

Explanation
Section one:  According to the first opinion, the laws of blowing the shofar and the recitation of blessings are the same for the Jubilee year as they are for Rosh Hashanah of every year.  The blessings referred to here are the special blessings recited as part of the Mussaf Amidah. We will learn more about these blessings in chapter four.
Section two:  Rabbi Judah says that different animals’ horns are used for the two shofars.  The one for Rosh Hashanah is that of a ram, whereas on the Jubilee they use the horn of an ibex. We should note that Rabbi Judah disagrees with the opinion in mishnah three above, according to which on Rosh Hashanah we use the horn of an ibex.
