Negaim, Chapter Twelve, Mishnah Two

Introduction
Today's mishnah deals with how large the nega must be for it to be a sign of impurity.  

Mishnah Two
1) And how many stones must there be in it [for it to be susceptible to negaim]?   
a) Rabbi Ishmael says: four.   
b) Rabbi Akiva says: eight.   
2) For Rabbi Ishmael used to say: a nega is not a cause of uncleanness unless it appeared in the size of two split beans on two stones or on one stone.   
3) Rabbi Akiva say: unless it appears in the size of two split beans on two stones, and not on one stone.   
4) Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Shimon says: unless it appears in the size of two split  beans, on two stones, on two walls in a corner, 
5) Its length being that of two split beans and its breadth that of one split bean. 

Explanation
Section one: Rabbi Ishmael says that there must be four stones in the house, at least one for each wall, in order for the house to be susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Akiva says that there must be two stones in each wall.
Section two: Rabbi Ishmael says that the nega must be at least the size of two split beans, but it need not be in two stones. Since it is sufficient for the nega to be on one stone, each wall has to have only one stone for the house to be susceptible. 
Section three: Rabbi Akiva says that the nega must appear on two stones. Therefore, there needs to be two stones in each wall.
Section four: Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Shimon says that the nega must appear on two stones, but each of the two stones must be on a different wall, such that the nega appears in the corner. If the nega appears on one stone on one wall, the house is still pure. 
Section five: This section is everyone's opinion. All sages agree that the nega must be at least the length of two split beans (which according to my math, makes one full bean!) but that its breadth need only be one split bean.
