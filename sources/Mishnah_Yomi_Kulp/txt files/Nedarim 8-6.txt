Nedarim, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Six

Introduction
At the end of yesterday’s mishnah we learned that “Until Pesach shall be” refers to Pesach eve, for that is when people are accustomed to drinking wine at the Seder.  Our mishnah lists other times of the year when people customarily eat certain things, namely meat on Yom Kippur eve and garlic on Friday eve.

Mishnah Six
1) If he vows, “Konam that I taste no meat until the fast [i.e., Yom Kippur] shall be,” he is forbidden only until the eve of the fast, for he merely meant until people usually eat meat.  
2) Rabbi Yose, his son, says: “Konam, that I not taste garlic until the Sabbath,” he is forbidden only until Sabbath eve [i.e., Friday night], for he meant, until it is customary for people to eat garlic.

Explanation
Section one:  On the afternoon before the fast of Yom Kippur it is customary to eat meat.  Therefore, one who vowed not to eat meat until Yom Kippur, meant that he will not eat meat until the eve of Yom Kippur, when people eat meat as their last meal before the fast.
Section two:  As we learned in Nedarim 3:10, garlic was considered an aphrodisiac and hence was eaten by Jews on the Sabbath eve, a time considered proper for sexual relations.  Therefore, one who vows not to eat garlic until the Sabbath, must have intended for garlic to be prohibited until Friday night, when people customarily eat garlic.
