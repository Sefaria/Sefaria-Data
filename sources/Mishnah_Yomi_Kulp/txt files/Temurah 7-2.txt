Introduction

Mishnah Two
There are [laws] which apply to dedications for the repairs of the Temple which don’t apply to dedications to the altar.
1) Unspecified dedications go to the repairs of the Temple.
2) Dedication for the repairs of the temple can have an effect on all things, 
3) The law of sacrilege applies to things that grow from them.
4) And there is no benefit to be derived from them for the priest.

Explanation
Section one: If one dedicates something to the Temple, even an animal that can be a sacrifice, it automatically goes towards Temple repair. If he wishes it to be a sacrifice, he must specify that the animal is to be a sacrifice.
Section two: Anything can be dedicated to be used for repairs for the Temple, even an animal that cannot be sacrificed, such as a pig or camel. The animal is sold and the proceeds go to the Temple. In contrast, only an unblemished kosher animal, bird or other sacrificable object can be dedicated to be put on the altar.
Section three: If one makes use of something that comes from an animal dedicated for Temple repair, such as milk from an animal or eggs from a bird, he has committed sacrilege (illicit use of holy property). The same is not true if he makes use of the same object that comes from an animal that has been dedicated to be a sacrifice. We will learn more about the laws of sacrilege in tractate Meilah.
Section four: Priests do not derive any personal benefit from animals or any other product dedicated for Temple repair. In contrast, they receive part of all animals dedicated to be sacrifices, either part of the meat or the hide.
