1) Just as the laws of fraud apply to buying and selling, so to do they apply to the spoken word.
a) One may not say, “How much is this object?, if he does not wish to buy it.
b) If one had repented, another should not say to him, “Remember your earlier deeds”.
c) If one descended from converts, another should not say to him, “Remember the deeds of your ancestors”.
2) For it is said (Exodus 22:21), “And a stranger you shall not wrong or oppress.”

Explanation
Just as a person can wrong another person by cheating him on a sale, so too can a person wrong another person through words.  One may not ask someone how much something costs he doesn’t intend to buy it.  This would raise false hopes for the seller.  One may not remind a person who had repented of his former deeds.  Nor may one remind a convert that his ancestors were idol worshippers.  These laws are learned from a midrash on the verse in Exodus 22:21.  The verse uses the word “ger” which in Biblical Hebrew means stranger but in Rabbinic Hebrew means convert.  The word for “wrong” in this verse is the same word used in Leviticus 25:14 (see above) from where we learned the laws of fraud.  The Rabbis extended the “wrong” mentioned in the verse to include even wrong done through words alone.
