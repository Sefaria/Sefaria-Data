Terumot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah One

Introduction
In the previous chapters we saw that one who eats terumah unwittingly must repay the amount that he ate plus an added fifth. Our mishnah and the mishnayot that follow discuss a non-priest who intentionally eats terumah. 

Mishnah One
1) One who eats terumah intentionally must repay its value, but not the fifth.
2) And the repayment remains hullin, therefore, if the priest wishes to forgive the repayment, he may.

Explanation
Section one: Paradoxically one who intentionally eats terumah pays less than one who does so accidentally. He does not pay the added fifth. There are two reasons for this. One is that the Torah specifies that one who eats terumah unwittingly pays the extra fifth (Leviticus 22:14). The rabbis read this verse precisely—only if one eats unwittingly does one pay the extra fifth. The second reason seems to be conceptual. The added fifth functions as atonement, and atonement is only given to one who accidentally sins. One who sins intentionally is not given the opportunity to atone, at least not in this simple and automatic way.
Section two: The repayment he makes does not become terumah, as it does in the case of one who eats unwittingly. Therefore, if the priest wants to forgive receiving his repayment, he may do so and the person who ate the terumah won’t have to pay anything (compare above, 6:1). It is interesting to compare this with the case of one who ate unwittingly. In that case the priest cannot forgive repayment because he must give the person a chance to atone for having eaten terumah. In this case he can’t atone through the repayment because he intentionally committed the sin. Therefore the repayment remains hullin and the priest can forgive the debt.
