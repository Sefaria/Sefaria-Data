Parah, Chapter Eight, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
Today's mishnah continues to discuss what water does not count as "living waters" and therefore cannot be used for the red cow ritual, or the other rituals that require living waters. 

Mishnah Nine
1) Spoiled waters are unfit. 
a) The following are spoiled waters: those that are salty or lukewarm. 
2) Waters that disappoint are unfit. 
a) The following are waters that disappoint: those that disappoint even once in a seven year cycle. 
b) Those that disappoint only in times of war or in years of drought are fit. 
i) Rabbi Judah says: they are unfit.

Explanation
Section one: Salty water or water that comes from warm ponds or such type of places does not count as "living water" because it is not drinkable.
Section two: Waters that "disappoint" are waters from springs or rivers that dry up periodically. If the river dries up even once every seven years, it still counts as "disappointing" and cannot be used. 
If the waters fail only in times of war, due to overdrawing by soldiers, or only in times of drought, they do not, according to the first opinion, count as "waters that disappoint" and they can be counted as "living waters." Rabbi Judah dissents and says that these too cannot be used.
