Gittin, Chapter Nine, Mishnah Three

Introduction
This mishnah provides the wording for the standard parts of divorce documents and documents which free slaves.
The mishnah is straightforward and doesn’t require any explanation.  One thing to note is that Rabbi Judah’s addition to the get is in Aramaic.  Documents in this period were in Aramaic (or Greek), the lingua franca(s) of Palestine during the mishnaic and talmudic periods.  Rabbi Judah may have insisted that the get be in Aramaic so that everyone would understand it.  
 
Mishnah Three
1) The body of the get is: “Behold you are permitted to any man.” 
a) Rabbi Judah says: [he must add] “And this shall be to you from me a writ of divorce and a letter of release and a bill of dismissal, with which you may go and marry any man that you wish.” 
2) The body of a writ of emancipation is: “Behold you are a free woman”, “Behold you belong to yourself.”
