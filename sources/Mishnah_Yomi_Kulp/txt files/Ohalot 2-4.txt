Ohalot, Chapter Two, Mishnah Four

Introduction
In mishnaic times burials were often done in caves. Our mishnah discusses the stones used to cover up the graves. 

Mishnah Four
1) The covering stone  and the buttressing stone [of a grave] defile by contact and overshadowing but not by carriage.   
a) Rabbi Eliezer says: they do defile by carriage. 
b) Rabbi Joshua says: if there is grave dust beneath them, they defile by carriage, but if not they do not defile by carriage. 
2) What is the buttressing stone? That upon which the covering stone is supported. 
a) But the stone that serves as buttress to the buttressing stone is clean.

Explanation
Section one: The covering stone is the stone rolled over the grave to seal it up. It transmits impurity by overshadowing and contact but not by carriage, probably because it is not something that is generally carried. Note that impurity by contact is stated explicitly in Numbers 19:16. However, Rabbi Eliezer says it does defile by carriage.
Rabbi Joshua notes that if there is grave dust underneath them, then they do defile by carriage because the grave dust is assumed to contain dust that originates with the dead body. But if there is no grave dust, the stones themselves do not transmit impurity through carriage.
Section two: The buttressing stone is that upon which the covering stone rests. Some explain that there were two such stones, one on each side. These stones themselves are governed by the same rule that governs the actual covering stone. But the stones that support the supporting stones are clean. They are far enough removed from the grave that they don't count as the grave itself.
