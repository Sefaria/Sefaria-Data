Nazir, Chapter Two, Mishnah Two

Introduction
This mishnah discusses a person who may have made a nazirite vow using an extremely strange formula.

Mishnah Two
If one says, “This cow is saying ‘Behold, I am a nazirite if I get up,” or “This door is saying ‘Behold, I am a nazirite if I open”:
Bet Shammai says:  he is a nazirite, 
But Bet Hillel says: he is not a nazirite. 
Rabbi Judah said: even though Beth Shammai did say [that his formula is effective] they meant only one who says, “This cow is [forbidden] to me, as is a sacrifice if it gets up.”

Explanation
The mishnah describes a person whose cow will not stand up or whose door will not open.  The person says “This cow doesn’t want to get up.  It is as if she is saying ‘Behold, I am a nazirite if I get up.’”  Or “This door doesn’t want to open.  It is as if it is saying ‘Behold, I am a nazirite if I open up.’”  
Beth Shammai holds that the person has actually made a nazirite vow, even though it seems that he was just using language to illustrate how difficult it is to get the cow to get up or the door to open. Albeck explains that according to Beth Shammai since the person said “Behold, I am a nazirite”, he is a nazirite even though he was saying it as if the cow or door was saying the words. A different explanation is offered by the Talmud, which interprets it as if he meant to say that he himself would be a nazirite if the cow wouldn’t get up or the door wouldn’t open.  
Beth Hillel holds that this person is not a nazirite, just as they did in the previous mishnah.
Rabbi Judah again reinterprets Beth Shammai’s position.  Beth Shammai did not mean to say that the person is a nazirite.  Beth Shammai holds that if the person meant that he would be forbidden to eat the cow or use the door as if it was a sacrifice then the vow is effective.
