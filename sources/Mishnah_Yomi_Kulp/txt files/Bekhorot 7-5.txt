Bekhorot, Chapter Seven, Mishnah Five

Introduction
More blemishes! 
The first two sections are straightforward so there is no explanation below. 

Mishnah Five
1) If the upper lip overlaps the lower or the lower lip overlaps the upper, behold this is a blemish. 
2) One whose teeth have fallen out is unfit [for the priesthood] for appearance sake.
3) If his breasts hang down like those of a woman, or his belly is swollen, or his navel sticks out, or if he is epileptic, even once every few days, or he is subject to melancholy, a me'ushkan and a ba'al gever [all these are unfit for the priesthood].
4) If he has no testicles, or only one testicle, this is the “meroah ashekh” mentioned in the Torah.   
a) Rabbi Ishmael says: anyone whose testicles were crushed.   
b) Rabbi Akiva says: anyone who has wind in his testicles. 
c) Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: one who has a black complexion.

Explanation
Section three: A “me’ushkan” is one whose testicles are unusually large. A “ba’al gever” is one whose penis is unusually large. Please do not ask me how large is too large. I’m also not sure if they had a measuring stick in the Temple ☺.
Section four: Leviticus 21:20 uses the word “meroah ashekh” to refer to a disqualifying blemish and in this section the rabbis debate its meaning. This is similar to the debate at the end of 7:2.
According to the first three opinions, the “meroah ashekh” has a problem with his testicles, either he is missing them or they are crushed. Rabbi Akiva says that the problem is that he has “wind in his testicles” meaning they are distended. As in 7:2, Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus offers up a completely different explanation. The word “ashekh” sounds like “hoshekh” which means “dark” or “black.” So the “meroah ashekh” is one whose complexion is black.
