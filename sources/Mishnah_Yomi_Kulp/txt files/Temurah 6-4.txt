Temurah, Chapter Six, Mishnah Four

Introduction
Today’s mishnah is the last mishnah to deal with the topic of “the price of a dog” and the “fee of a prostitute.” 

Mishnah Four 
1) If he gave her [a prostitute] money, it is permitted [for use for the altar.] 
a) [But if he gave her] wine, oil, flour and anything similar which is offered on the altar, it is forbidden for the altar. 
2) If he gave her dedicated [animals] they are permitted [for the altar]. 
3) If he gave her birds [of hullin] they are disqualified.
4) For one might have reasoned [as follows]: if in the case of dedicated animals, where a blemish disqualifies them, [the law] of [the prostitute’s] fee and price [of a dog] does not apply to them, in the case of birds, where a blemish does not disqualify, is it not all the more reason that the law of [the prostitute’s] fee and the price [of a dog] should not apply? Scripture says, “For any vow,” (Deuteronomy 23:19) this includes a bird.

Explanation
Section one: If one pays a prostitute with money (I think today that this is preferred over giving her a lamb), the money can later be used to buy a sacrifice.  The only thing that becomes prohibited is something can be sacrifice, such as wine, oil and flour. 
Section two: If he gives her an animal already dedicated to the Temple, it does not become prohibited. This is because an animal that is already dedicated is not his money any more, and one cannot prohibit something that does not belong to him. 
Section three: The mishnah includes birds as being prohibited if given to a prostitute for her fee. 
Section four: The mishnah now explains why one might have even thought that these laws don’t apply to a bird. We have already learned in section two that the laws of the fee of a prostitute and the price of a dog don’t apply to dedicated animals. The laws concerning blemishes (that a blemished animal cannot be sacrificed) do, however, apply to dedicated animals. This makes the laws governing dedicated animals more stringent than the laws governing birds, which are not disqualified by defects. Therefore, if the laws of the fee of a prostitute and the price of a dog don’t apply to the more stringent case of dedicated animals, all the more so they should not apply to the more lenient case of the bird. Therefore, the Torah teaches “for any vow” to let us know that birds are included in the prohibition.
