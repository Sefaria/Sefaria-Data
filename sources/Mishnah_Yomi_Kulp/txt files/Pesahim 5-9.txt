Pesahim, Chapter Five, Mishnah Nine

Introduction
After the blood of the sacrifice had been thrown onto the altar the next step was to flay the animal so that some of its inner fats could be taken out and offered on the altar.  Our mishnah describes how the animal was flayed.   

Mishnah Nine
How did they hang up [the sacrifices] and flay [them]? 
1) There were iron hooks fixed in the walls and in the pillars, on which they hung up [the sacrifices] and flayed [them]. 
2) If any one had no place to suspend and flay [their sacrifice], there were there thin smooth staves which he placed on his shoulder and on his fellow’s shoulder, and so hung up [the animal] and flayed [it]. 
3) Rabbi Eliezer says: when the fourteenth fell on Shabbat, he placed his hand on his fellow’s shoulder and his fellow’s hand on his shoulder, and he hung up [the sacrifice] and flayed [it]. 

Explanation
The animal was hung up by its hind legs and its skin was flayed and removed.  The hanging was done on fixed hooks in the walls or in pillars which were in the slaughtering area in the Temple courtyard.  From section two we can see that there were not always enough hooks to hang up all of the sacrifices.  In such a case two people would hold up poles on their shoulders and suspend the animal from them.  Rabbi Eliezer holds that on Shabbat these poles could not be carried and therefore instead of using poles they would simply hang up the animal on two people’s shoulders.  The rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer.  According to their opinion the prohibition of using these poles on Shabbat is only one of “shevut”—rabbinically mandated rest on Shabbat.  In the Temple, since these prohibitions are not “deoraita”—of toraitic origin—they are waived.  Since the sages hold that the flaying is done in the same way on Shabbat and during the week, this was not listed as a difference in yesterday’s mishnah.
