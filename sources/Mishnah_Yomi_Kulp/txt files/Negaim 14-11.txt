Negaim, Chapter Fourteen, Mishnah Eleven

Introduction
The type of animal that the metzora brings for his guilt and whole burnt offering depend on whether he is rich or poor. If he is rich he brings lambs and if he is poor he can bring birds. Our mishnah discusses a situation where a person goes from being rich to poor or vice versa.

Mishnah Eleven
1) If a metzora brought his sacrifice as a poor man and he became rich, or as a rich man and he became poor, all depends on the sin-offering, the words of Rabbi Shimon. 
2) Rabbi Judah says: all depends on the guilt-offering. 

Explanation
Section one: According to Rabbi Shimon, a person's status is determined at the time he offers to sin offering. If he was poor when he offered the bird as a sin offering and he gets rich, he can still bring a bird as the burnt offering. However, if he is rich when he offers the sin offering and then he becomes poor, he must still offer the lamb as his whole burnt offering.
Section two: The guilt offering must be a lamb, even if the metzora is poor. It is also the first of the offerings to be sacrificed. The status of the metzora is determined at this point—if he is rich at this point, he must bring lambs and if he is poor he can bring birds.
