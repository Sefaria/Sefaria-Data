Mishnah Four
1) One may not bring a sin-offering by virtue of [the purifications made for] another sin-offering, nor one child by virtue of [the preparations made for] another. 
2) The children had to be sprinkle on each other, the words of Rabbi Yose the Galilean.
a) Rabbi Akiva says: they did not need to sprinkle.

Explanation
Section one: If they begin to make preparations to burn one red cow and somehow that red cow becomes disqualified (for instance, someone performs work with it, or it grows some black hairs) they have to start the preparations all over again. The preparations for the burning of a red cow, in other words, must be done with that red cow in mind. So too, if one child begins to perform the preparations and then for whatever reason doesn't complete them, they can't bring another child to finish the process. They must start anew.
Section two: According to Rabbi Yose the Galilean, the children need to sprinkle the water on each other, before they sprinkle it onto the priest who will burn the cow. Rabbi Akiva says that this is not necessary.
