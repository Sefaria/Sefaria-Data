Kilayim, Chapter Nine, Chapter Eight

Introduction
When referring to kilayim, the Torah uses the word “shatnez.”  Our mishnah understands this word as an acronym and derives halakhah from the word.

Mishnah Eight
1) Only that which is spun or woven is forbidden under the law of kilayim, as it says, “You shall not wear shatnez” (Deuteronomy 22:11), that which is shua (combed) tavui (spun) and nuz (woven).   
2) Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: [the word shaatnez means that] he [the transgressor] is perverted (naloz) and causes his father in heaven to avert himself [from him].  

Explanation
Section two: "Naloz" means to "pervert" or "corrupt" and it is a pun on the end of the word shaatnez. The transgressor has perverted God's laws, and by doing thus he causes God to pervert His path from him (meliz, another form of naloz).
