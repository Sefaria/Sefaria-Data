Mishnah Three
1) They then began to take up the logs to place onto the fire. 
2) Were all kinds of wood valid for the fire? 
a) All kinds of wood were valid for the fire except vine and olive wood. 
b) But what they mostly used were boughs of fig trees and of nut trees and of oil trees.

Explanation
Section one: After having cleared the altar of the ashes or at least pushing them into the middle of the altar, the priests can now begin to bring up new wood to use to burn the day’s sacrifices.
Section two: Any wood could be used on the altar except for olive wood and vines. These were not used for kindling because these are the primary fruit bearing trees in Israel. It would be completely wasteful to use them as firewood. 
The most common trees were figs, nuts and oil trees. Note that these trees also bear fruit, but they were used for fire because their fruit was less significant than the wine and oil that come from the vine and olive trees. Alternatively, some commentators claim that these types of trees can only be used if the figs, nuts or oil that they produce are of low quality.
