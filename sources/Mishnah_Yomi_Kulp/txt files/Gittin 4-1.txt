Gittin, Chapter Four, Mishnah One

Introduction
The fourth chapter of Gittin begins by discussing a husband who sends a get to his wife and then attempts to annul the get.  The general rule is that as long as the get has not yet gotten to her hand, he may annul the get.

Mishnah One
1) If man sends a get to his wife and then catches up with the messenger, or sends a messenger after the original messenger, and says to him, “The get which I gave you is annulled”, then it is annulled. 
2) If the husband arrives at his wife before [the messenger] or sends a messenger to her and says, “The get which I sent to you is annulled”, then it is annulled. 
3) Once the get has reached her hand, he cannot annul it. 

Explanation
Section one:  In this case after sending the get to his wife with a messenger, the husband either catches up with the original messenger or sends a second messenger to catch up with the first and one of them tells the original messenger that the get is cancelled. The mishnah rules that the get is cancelled.  Since the woman is not divorced until she receives the get, the husband may cancel it any time until this point.
Section two:  In this case, the husband or his agent does not chase after the original messenger but rather the husband or his agent arrives at the wife before the messenger does.  Again, since she has not yet received the get, the get is annulled. In both of these cases, even if the messenger should subsequently give her the get she is not divorced.  
Section three:  However, once she has received the get she is no longer his wife and there isn’t anything he can do about it.
