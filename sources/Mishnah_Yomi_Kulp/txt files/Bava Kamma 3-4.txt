
Mishnah Four
1) Two pot-sellers were walking one behind the other and the first stumbled and fell, and the second fell on the first, the first one is liable for the injury caused to the second.

Explanation

Mishnah four teaches us the principle that accidentally stumbling is not an excuse for causing damages.  Although the person who tripped certainly did not intend to do so, and probably caused damage to the things he himself was carrying (pots), he is still liable. He should have walked more carefully.

Questions for Further Thought:
 Mishnah four uses the example of pot-sellers.  Why use this example?  What piece of information might the mishnah be teaching by using this example and not, for instance regular pedestrians?
 What are some modern day situations that are similar to these mentioned in the mishnah?  How does modern law differ?  How is it the same?
