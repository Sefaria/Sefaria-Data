Yehoshophot gave over the throne to Yehorom during his lifetime because he wanted to establish Yehorom as his successor and to prevent conflict among the brothers. This occurred at the end of Yehoshophot’s reign. The first seven years of Yehorom’s reign were while his father was alive. The second year of Yehorom’s reign corresponds with the year that Yehorom son of Achov became king over Yisroel, as stated below in 3:1.@ms @n17@fn@ee@n2Tosefta Maseches Sotah 12:2.
@fn@fn@n11@fn@n2See Yechezkeil 1:4, where a “@hhרוּחַ סְעָרָה@ee” is part of the vision of the @hhמַעֲשֶׂה מֶרְכָּבָה@ee that is described by Yechezkeil.@ms @n12@fn@ee@n2Alternatively, he did not want Elisha to be frightened by seeing the manner by which he was being taken away.—Ralbag@ms @n13@fn@ee@n2I.e., their level of prophecy was equal to Eliyahu’s. Tosefta Maseches Sotah 12:5.@ms
@n1@n14@fn@ee@n2I.e., he did not fold it neatly on its creases, but he bunched it up together.@ms
@n1@n15@fn@ee@n2According to Rashi, Elisha apparently asked for a double portion of Eliyahu’s spirit. Alternatively, Elisha requested to attain two thirds of Eliyahu’s spirit and for all other prophets together to attain one third. -Radak Or, Elisha requested double the spirit of any other prophet.—Ralbag@ms @n16@fn@ee@n2I.e., if you are spiritually elevated enough to observe my ascent, it would be an indication that your request would be granted.@ms
@n1@n17@fn@ee@n2He referred to Eliyahu as “father,” because one’s disciples are considered like one’s own children, and conversely, the teacher is considered a father.—Ralbag See Rashi in Devarim 6:7.@ms @n18@fn@ee@n2I.e., his prayers are more effective for Yisroel than chariots and horsemen.—Targum@ms @n19@fn@ee@n2Alternatively, where is God who does not show me His sign as He showed Eliyahu is the splitting of the water?”—Ralbag@ms
@n1@n110@fn@ee@n2See Rashi 3:1 below. Thus, Elisha’s request for twice Eliyahu’s spirit had been fulfilled.@ms @n111@fn@ee@n2Above, v. 5.@ms @n112@fn@ee@n2They thought Eliyahu’s spirit returned to God, but his body was cast to the ground, and they sought to find it and bury it.—Metzudas Dovid@ms @n113@fn@ee@n2Some say that Eliyahu’s body remained whole and unharmed. He was carried to @hhגַּן עֵדֶן@ee where he remains hidden from mankind except when he is sent on special missions or to appear to the righteous. Radak Alternatively, they did not know that he would be removed from the world. Rather, they thought that God would take Eliyahu away to some remote location for a period of time.

18@fn@ee@n2Above, at the beginning of this verse.@ms @n119@fn@ee@n2Maseches Sotah 47a. Rabbi Yochonon said that there are three types of charm. 1. The charm a place that is perceived by its inhabitants. 2. The charm a woman holds for her husband. 3. The charm of a newly purchased item for its buyer.@ms @n120@fn@ee@n2This miracle was similar to the one performed by Moshe in Marah. After traveling through the wilderness for three days without water, the Bnei Yisroel finally came to a spring only to find the water undrinkably bitter. Moshe threw a tree whose wood was bitter into the water and the water became sweet and drinkable. See Shemos 15:22-26.—Radak@ms @n121@fn@ee@n2The literal meaning of @hhנְעָרִים קְטַנִּים@ee is “small children,” but obviously this is not the true meaning, because Elisha would never have cursed small children. The word @hhנְעָרִים@ee can also be interpreted as @hhנְעוּרִים@ee [=shaken out or empty] from good deeds. The word @hhקטנים@ee [=little] alludes to how small their faith was. Nonetheless, Elisha was punished for treating them so harshly. See Maseches Sotah 47a. Radak Alternatively, the boys came from a town called @hhנַעֲרָן@ee, which is mentioned in I Divrei Hayomim 7:28 and in Yehoshua 16:7. See below, 5:2.@ms @n122@fn@ee@n246b, and see Rashi there.@ms @n123@fn@ee@n2See Shemos 2:12 and Rashi there.@ms @n124@fn@ee@n2Some say that Elisha saw that their hair was cut in the style of the heathens.

@n1@n18@fn@ee@n2See Yalkot Shimoni 247:214.@ms @n19@fn@ee@n2Alternatively, this is an expression to indicate Elisha’s total devotion to Eliyahu to the extent that he even poured water on Eliyahu’s hands. From here we derive that those who serve Torah scholars are greater than those who only study the Torah. See Maseches Berachos 7b.@ms @n110@fn@ee@n2Alternatively, @hhGא@ee means “do not,” i.e., “do not tell us these things now, etc.”—Radak@ms
@n1@n111@fn@ee@n2See Maseches Pesachim 66b. Alternatively, Elisha was unable to prophesy because he was mourning Eliyahu’s departure. The Divine Presence does not reside with people who are sad. It rests on prophets only when they experience joy in their fulfillment of a @itmitzvah@ic. See Maseches Pesachim 117a.@ms @n112@fn@ee@n2Devarim 20:19.@ms
@n1@n113@fn@ee@n2Devarim 23:7.@ms @n114@fn@ee@n2Rashi is explaining the apparent contradiction between the expressions “morning” and “when the meal-offering was offered up” which refers to the afternoon services. Rashi explains that two expressions refer to the beginning and end of the miracle.@ms @n115@fn@ee@n2Alternatively, God caused one of the rivers in Edom to overflow its banks causing the valley near the camp to fill with water.—Radak@ms @n116@n2Above v. 17.@ms
@n1@n117@n2This is Rashi’s explanation of @hh@c2בַּקִּיר חֲרָשֶׂת@fn@ee [=the clay in the wall]. @fnAlternatively, @hhקִיר חֲרָשֶׂת@ee was the name of a mighty fortified city in Moav. Generally, enemy cities would be destroyed after their capture. But, because @hhקִיר חֲרָשֶׂת@ee was a mighty fortified city, they needed catapulters to destroy its wall in order to capture it.—Radak@ms
@n1@n118@fn@ee@n2There are different opinions whose firstborn son was offered as a burnt offering. Some say that the king of Edom’s firstborn son was in the custody of Moav’s king, and he was burnt by the king of Moav. Others maintain that Meisha, the king of Moav, sacrificed his own son. In Maseches Sanhedrin 39b there are also different opinions whether the firstborn was offered to God or to a heathen deity.—Radak@ms @n119@fn@ee@n2I.e., it should have been spelled @hhחוֹמָה@ee.@ms @n120@fn@ee@n2See Maseches Sanhedrin 39b.

@n1@n116@fn@ee@n2I.e., Elisha was guaranteeing her future health by comparing it to her present state of health. Alternatively, @hhחַיָּה@ee refers to a woman who gives birth and @hhכָּעֵת חַיָּה@ee refers to a nine month span, the normal period of pregnancy. Elisha told her that the baby will be born after fully developing in the womb.—Metzudas Dovid@ms @n117@fn@ee@n2She suspected that her son would survive for only a short period because the prophet used the expression “you will be hugging a son” instead of “you will have a son,” the expression used by the angels when they told Avrohom that Sarah will bear him a son. See Bereishis 18:10.—Malbim@ms
@n1@n118@fn@ee@n2Yeshayahu 58:11.@ms @n119@fn@ee@n2I.e., the ‘@hhכ@ee’ is voweled with a @hhקָמַץ@ee instead of a @hhשְׁוָא@ee.@ms @n120@fn@ee@n2It is common for those in pain to repeat their cries; see Yirmiyahu 4:19.—Radak@ms

@n1@n124@fn@ee@n2Geichazi took his mission very lightly and considered it a joke. He was therefore unsuccessful in his mission. Radak@ms @n125@fn@ee@n2Alternatively, Elisha initially thought that the boy had merely fainted and therefore his personal presence would not be necessary.—Malbim@ms

It was sort of a passage from the palace to the Beis Hamikdosh.@ms @n117@n2Devorim 17:19. Adonoy king must always have a Torah Scroll with him at all times. Therefore, the Torah Scroll acts as a testimony of royalty. Alternatively, the Torah Scroll is referred to as “testimony.” See Shemos 25:16 and Rashi there.—Metzudas Dovid@ms @n118@n2Alternatively, @hhעֵדוּת@ee refers to the royal robes.—Radak@ms @n119@n2See Maseches Avodah Zarah 44a, and Rashi there.@ms @n120@n2Alternatively, @hhעַמּוּד@ee merely refers to a location in that area that was set aside for the king.@ms @n121@n2See Devorim 23:13 where the word “@hhיַד@ee” means “a place.”@ms @n122@n2And that they uproot all the idolatry that had become pervasive at the time.@ms @n123@n2And in return the king will wage wars for the people.—Metzudas Dovid@ms @n124@n2See II Divrei Hayomim 24:7.@ms @n125@n2Literally the verse reads “by way of the Gate of the Runners @itof@ic the king’s palace.” However, Rashi in v. 5 above explained that the Gate of the Runners was one of the gates of the Temple’s court.

@fn@n11@n2Shemos Rabboh 8:2.@ms @n12@n2Accordingly, the meaning of the verse is “all his days as Yehoyada the @itkohein@ic instructed him,” i.e., as long as Yehoyada was alive.—Radak Or, “all his days” refers to Yehoyada’s days.

However, if there was money left over, it could be used for making utensils, instruments, etc. for the Temple.—Radak@ms @n113@n2Rashi maintains that @hhסִפּוֹת@ee are musical instruments in accordance with his view in I Melochim 7:50. Alternatively, they are vessels used to receive blood of sacrifices or wine of libations.—Ralbag@ms @n114@n223b.@ms @n115@n2See Maseches Zevachim 103a.@ms @n116@n2Scripture describes the location of Beis Millo, “that leads down to Selo” which was near Yerusholayim, because there was another Beis Millo near Shechem mentioned in Shoftim 9:6, 20.—Malbim@ms @n117@n2II Divrei Hayomim 24:26.
