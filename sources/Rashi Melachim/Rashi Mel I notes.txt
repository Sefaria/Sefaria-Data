15The expression @hhבמדבר בארץ@ee [=in the desert in the land] is somewhat ambiguous. Therefore Rashi suggests that the desert was located near a civilized area. Alternatively, the city was bordered by a desert on one side, and by arable land on the other side.—Ralbag@ms

However the Torah demands that a king be treated with respect. See Shemos 11:8 and Rashi there.@ms
4I.e., his hand became paralyzed. Yerovom had stretched out his hand to signal his servants to seize the man of God.—Metzudas Dovid@ms
 5Yerovom did not deserve to be healed, but God healed his hand as an incentive for him to repent.—Ralbag@ms 6According to some opinions the prophet was Michah. Others opine it was either Amatzyah, or Yiddo, or Yonoson the son of Gershom.—Radak@ms

11This is indeed what happened. See below, II Melochim 23:18.@ms 12See Maseches Sanhedrin 102a. The conversation continued, “Yerovom said, ‘Who will walk in front?’ [and the reply was,] ‘The son of Yishy.’ [Yerovom responded,] ‘If so, I want no part of it.’”
@fn@fn1It was a custom in those days to give a prophet a present before asking him a question. See I Shmuel 9:7,8.—Ralbag@ms

5The Gemara in Maseches Sanhedrin 102b states that Achov’s minor sins were like Yerovom’s major ones. If so, why are Yerovom’s sins emphasized here? Because he opened the way to sin for the Bnei Yisroel.@ms 6In addition to the Baal, he also worshiped the @itAsheirah@ic.—Radak@ms 7I Shmuel 16:1.@ms 8I Shmuel 6:14.@ms 9Shoftim 6:11.@ms 10Yehoshua 6:26.

@fn@fn1The Gemara in Maseches Sanhedrin 39b states that he followed the same strategy used by Yaakov to protect his family from Eisav. Yaakov divided his household into two groups so that some would survive if Eisav were to attack. Alternatively, each cave could accommodate only 50 people.@ms 2Below v. 12.@ms

4I.e., they were undecided.@ms 5And ultimately it was Eliyahu who “gave” the ox to the prophets of the Baal. Alternatively, Achov supplied the oxen, and they chose the one they wanted. Achov then “gave” them the ox they chose.—Radak@ms 6Bamidbar Rabboh 23:9.@ms
7A ‘@hhח@ee’ and an ‘@hhע@ee’ are both guttural letters and are therefore interchangeable.@ms 8Although once the Beis Hamikdosh was built private altars were not permitted, however, extraordinary circumstances allow for the suspension of certain laws in cases of dire necessity, such as this. See Maseches Sanhedrin 89b and Tosafos there. Also see footnote on v. 36 below.@ms 9Alternatively, as a result of the miracle on Mount Carmel, many people repented and went to Yerusholayim to offer sacrifices in the Beis Hamikdosh.

Alternatively, “You misled them by occasionally allowing their idolatrous prayers to be effective.”—Ralbag Or, Eliyahu is referring to the future and is saying, “When You answer my prayer and send down fire, You will have turned their hearts away from the Baal and back to You.”—Radak in the name of Rav Sa’adyah Gaon@ms 24Bamidbar 16:29.@ms

@fn@fn1According to the opinion that Eliyahu is Pinchos, Aharon’s grandson, he was over 500 years old at this time.@ms 2Yeshayahu 6:6.@ms 3Shemos 33:22.

10Alternatively, “you should appoint another prophet in your place because you had asked to die, and for God to take your soul,” in v. 4 above.—Radak@ms 11See II Melochim 2:24. Alternatively, the hunger in Shomron was initiated by Elisha’s curse, as implied in II Melochim 6:31.—Ralbag@ms
12Eliyahu was testing Elisha’s resolve.—Radak
@fn@fn1Tehillim 19:11.@ms 2He therefore could not give away the Torah without consulting the elders.@ms 3Below v. 7.@ms 4See Maseches Sanhedrin 102b. Despite all his sins, Achov believed in the Torah and refused to give it up. He was ready to go to war if necessary, to defend it. God therefore rewarded him with a reign of 22 years corresponding to the 22 letters of the @itAlef Beis@ic with which the Torah is written.@ms
5Alternatively, @hhשעלים@ee means fistfuls, and Ben-Hadad said, that if each of his soldiers was to take a fistful of the dirt of Shomron, there would not be enough dirt for them, for his army was so large.—Radak@ms 6Bamidbar 22:24.@ms 7Yeshayahu 40:12.@ms 8Chavakuk 3:15.@ms
9See below 22:8.@ms
10Also, this may have served as a demonstration of loyalty to the king. Alternatively, they were the children of Achov’s high ranking officers who were raised in the royal court.—Radak@ms 11Being an idolater, Achov felt that he was unworthy to have a miracle performed through him and therefore he looked for another leader.—Radak@ms 12Above 19:18.@ms
13Alternatively, in the spring, kings go out to war because there provisions are available in the fields for the troops and their animals. See II Shmuel 11:1 and Rashi there.@ms
14Alternatively, @hhוכלכלו@ee means and they all [=@hhכל@ee] were accounted for and none were missing.—Radak@ms 15I.e., they are small in number in comparison with Arom’s army which “filled the land.”.

22The preceding word [@hhויחלטו@ee] and the succeeding word [@hhהממנו@ee].@ms 23And you can collect taxes from the markets in Damascus.—Radak@ms
24Achov chose to be gracious to Ben-Hadad even though he had been commanded to destroy Arom. However, dealing mercifully with evildoers is evil in itself because the evildoers will eventually cause others to suffer.—Radak@ms 25Bamidbar 31:49.@ms
26Yeshayahu 34:5.@ms 27Alternatively, @hhאיש חרמי@ee means “the man whom I condemned.”—Radak
@fn@fn1Achov did not attempt to take this vineyard by force because he was afraid of a popular rebellion if he were to act unjustly.—Radak@ms
2Thus making him liable to death for either offense. The reason for mentioning both offenses is to arouse the people’s anger against Navos and thereby he would be executed quickly. See Maseches Sanhedrin 48b.—Metzudas Dovid@ms
3Some are of the opinion that even those executed by the king do not lose their right of having their property inherited by their closest of kin. Therefore they suggest that Achov was the son of, etc.@ms 4See Maseches Sanhedrin 48b.@ms

18Above 21:19.@ms 19But how is this possible, Navos was killed in Yizreel while Achov was killed in Shomron?
