Leviticus 2:1,"[1]A meal-offering without specifying. Otherwise, it should say: “When a person brings a meal-offering to Adonoy, if his offering shall be of fine flour,” and afterwards (v. 4): “And when you bring a meal-offering that has been baked in an oven,” as it does concerning the burntoffering (1:3): “If his offering is a burnt offering [of cattle],” [and afterwards (v. 10): “If his offering is from flocks of sheep,”] and then (v. 14): “[If his burnt-offering to Adonoy is] of fowl.” Rather, it must be that the reason it says in a definitive fashion is to convey that whoever says: I am obligated [to bring] a meal-offering without specifying [which one] must bring a fine-flour meal offering. Which is the first. Rashi does not mean to say because it is the first [mentioned], for if so, one who volunteers to bring a burnt offering [without specifying] should have to bring specifically from cattle. Rather, this is what it means: He brings the fine flour meal-offering which is the first of the meal-offerings, and not from one of the other four meal-offerings that are from fine flour as well. Rashi gives the reason why the fine flour meal-offering is called the first, more than other meal-offerings, and says because its fistful is taken while it is [still] fine flour, but all the other four meal-offerings have their fistfuls taken only after they are baked. Although the halachah follows the view of the Sages (Menachos 104b) who said he [one who volunteers to bring a meal-offering without specifying] may bring from whichever [mealoffering] he wants, [nevertheless,] since this is closer to the verse’s plain meaning, Rashi’s way is to explain it this way even though it is not in accordance with the halachah. But to exclude. Meaning: Each [mention of the word] “upon it” in Scripture is to include. Therefore, the Sages derived from the first inclusion “upon it” that he shall put the oil on all of the fine flour and mix thoroughly together. From the second “upon it,” which would now be an inclusion after an inclusion — and there is no inclusion after inclusion but to exclude — they derived that he should place the frankincense on part of the flour, and it is not required that he put it on all of the flour, for it does not need to be mixed thoroughly. Rather, he puts it on the fine flour in one place, and at the time of burning the fistful, he gathers the frankincense from there and burns both of them together. From its flour and from its oil. I.e., since it is written: “He takes from there its fistful from its flour and from its oil,” we hear that the oil was mixed thoroughly with the fine flour, which excludes with regard to frankincense, where it is written: “With all its frankincense.” From this we hear that the frankincense is not taken as a fistful with the fine flour, because it is impossible to take all the frankincense with one fistful. Rather, after he takes the fistful [he gathers the frankincense]. Are valid when done by a non-kohein. Meaning: Rashi knows that “pouring” [is valid when done by a non-kohein] because it is written: “He shall pour oil upon it ... he shall bring it to the sons of Aharon.” Perforce, before he brings it to the kohein, he is permitted to put oil upon it, thus it implies that even a non-kohein may “pour.” “Mixing” also [can be done by a non-kohein] as demonstrated from what is written (v. 5) regarding a panbaked meal-offering: “mixed with oil,” and afterwards it is written (v. 6): “and pour oil on it.” Perforce, since the pouring is after the mixing, and since the pouring is valid with a non-kohein, as we explained, so certainly the mixing, which precedes the pouring, is valid if done by a non-kohein (Re”m). Rashi mentioned pouring and mixing but did not mention the placing of the frankincense and the bringing, which were mentioned explicitly in the verse, because he mentions a matter through which the meal-offering is done, which excludes placing [the frankincense] because the meal-offering is not done with it, for he gathers the frankincense from it afterwards, and similarly, the meal-offering is not done through the bringing [either] (Gur Aryeh). "
Leviticus 3:3,"[3]The fat on the stomach. Meaning: The fat on the small intestines are included [as well] by kal vachomer, since they have two signs of forbidden [fats]: They are spread like a garment and they have a detachable membrane. Rabbi Akiva, though, says only the [fat on the] small intestines [are included] because they have two signs: They are spread like a garment and they have a detachable membrane, but [the fats] on the stomach are not spread like a garment, but rather are many pieces of fat [that are attached to the stomach]. The word תותב means a garment, as the Targum Onkeles [writes in Shemos 22:26] היא שמלתו = היא תותביה."
Leviticus 4:2,"[2]A negative commandment and kareis. This excludes circumcision and Pesach, which only have kareis [but are positive commandments; also, not for something whose intentional violation is a negative commandment alone, such as not harvesting the corners of the field, and most of the Torah’s other negative commandments]; and not something which is a negative commandment and punishable by execution by a Beis Din, but not kareis, such as one who strikes his father or mother, one who kidnaps an Israelite, or the rebellious elder; and not for something whose intentional violation is a negative commandment and has the penalty of kareis, but it does not involve an active deed, such as one who curses his father, conspiring witnesses, a blasphemer, a sorcerer, an enticer or one who causes others to worship idols, or a false prophet. All these were learned from what it is written [regarding idol worship] (Bamidbar 15:29): “One law shall apply to anyone who sins inadvertently,” and it is written (ibid. 30): “But if a person should act highhandedly (intentionally) ... [and that soul shall be cut off from among its people].” The Torah compares (hekeish) all the inadvertent transgressions of the Torah and the inadvertent transgression of idolatry in that they are liable for its intentional violation the penalty of kareis and for its unintentional violation, a sin-offering. Noach of Nochor. Because it is written, “from one [of these],” it implies that even a part [of one of them]. We should not say [that one who writes on Shabbos] even one letter, because we derive from the word “one” as well, i.e., as if Scripture wrote, “one,” which would imply [he writes on Shabbos] the entire name. Therefore, [in resolution] we say that he is liable only if he writes Shem of Shimon, which is both, a whole name in itself, and also part of another name. "
Leviticus 5:1,"[1]In which he is a witness. This is derived from “He is a witness,” which is redundant [since the verse had already stated “he heard an oath” and continues with “or saw or knew”]; it excludes a witness who heard [secondhand] from another witness, a relative, or an invalid [witness] — even though he hears an oath [demanding testimony] he is exempt. Also, it teaches: “And he is a witness” — now, at the time of the oath, he is a witness in the matter, [but if they made him take an oath that if he will become aware of testimony in the future that he must testify, he is exempt]. "
Leviticus 6:2,"[2]An expression of “urging.” Rashi explains in the Gemara (Kiddushin 29a) that [זירוז means] one should be quick and vigorous. You might ask: Why does Rashi not explain this above on the verse in Parshas Tetzaveh (Shemos 27:20)? The answer is: [There,] the urging is a result of the special expertise needed to harvest the olives from the olive tree’s top [branches] and to crush them in a mortar so there will be no sediment. And for generations. [Rashi knows this] from what is written (Devarim 3:28): “Command Yehoshua and strengthen him” — [the addition of the word “and strengthen him” shows that] this is an expression of “urging.” “And for generations” — it is written in Parshas Emor (24:2-3): “Command the children of Israel and let them take [pure olive] oil ... from evening until morning before Hashem, continually, as an everlasting statute throughout your generations,” this stipulates “for generations.” “Immediately” — it says in Parshas Behaloscha (Bamidbar 8:3): “Aharon did so; he lit the lamps toward the face of the menorah, as Hashem had commanded...” — this denotes “immediately.” Monetary loss. I.e., [Rabbi Shimon is saying] it is specifically in a place where there is monetary loss that it needs to write צו for urging, but where there is no monetary loss it does not need to write צו, even if it is an expression of urging, immediately and for future generations. And [according to this] Rabbi Shimon disagrees [with the Tanna Kama]. [You might ask:] It says here צו even though there is [seemingly] no monetary loss! The answer is: Since the kohanim do not have any benefit from the burntoffering besides its skin, and that was only given to the kohein who brought the burnt-offering, therefore it is called a monetary loss as well. However, Re’m writes that Rabbi Shimon is not coming to argue on the words of the Tanna Kama. Rather, he is coming to add and say that the primary reason that Scripture uses the expression “command” is because there is monetary loss. However, when there is no monetary loss [although there is urging, immediately and for future generations,] the word צו is not applicable. The same applies when there is no urging, immediately and for future generations, although there is monetary loss, the expression צו is not applicable, etc. (see there, where Re’m dwells at length). [You might ask:] It is written regarding the apportioning of Eretz Yisroel (Bamidbar 34:2): “Command (צו) the children of Yisroel,” although there is no monetary loss! The answer is: Since the entire people of Yisroel were disparate with regard to the conquering of the Land, for one tribe took a larger portion than another, and some took a portion in the hills and some in the plains, it is also considered, in some aspect, a monetary loss. Re’m, however, explains the entire matter differently, examine it and choose for yourself. Meaning: Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say this, specifically here? All the offerings are applicable immediately and for future generations! He answers: All the offerings have a benefit for the kohanim in that they receive a portion of the sacrifice. Therefore, each kohein will hurry and not be indolent in the Divine service, so that he will not be preempted by someone else. This however, does not apply to a burnt-offering, which is entirely burnt, and the kohanim did not receive any of the meat. Therefore, I might think they would be indolent with it. This then would be a monetary loss for the kohein of that watch. Therefore, it says צו, an expression of urging (Divrei Dovid). Nachalas Yaakov explains that regarding other offerings they bring only the blood and the fats [to the altar] and the meat is eaten by the kohanim. Thus, their benefit is large and their effort is minimal. This is not so concerning the burnt-offering, for a lot of effort is involved [in bringing it to the altar] and its benefit is minimal — [they receive] only the hide — therefore, it requires urging. Rashi is answering the question: The laws of the burnt-offering were already set down in Parshas Vayikro! Rather, it comes to teach... (Gur Areyeh). Valid all night. Rashi knows this from the end of the verse, where it is written: “All night, until the morning.” It is [from there] he derives this. If taken up, need not be taken down. This is because the altar sanctifies them. It is written afterwards: “It is the burnt-offering” — which comes to exclude, implying “it” and not another. [This implies that some of them, even if they were taken up must be taken down. When is this so?] Rashi explains [later]: “It is the burnt-offering, to exclude [a male animal] which was with a woman and [a female animal] which was with a man, and similar cases, whose disqualification [did not occur] in the Holiness [=the Temple].” Rashi is saying that these could have been disqualified before they were sanctified, [and therefore, even if they went up on the altar must be taken down,] but other invalid sacrifices, for instance, those that became impure, or other disqualifications that are inapplicable until after they had become sanctified, [if they were taken up they need not be taken down]. Toras Kohanim lists all these [examples], and Re’m cites them. Re’m writes: You might ask: Why do we need this exclusion: “It is the burnt-offering” — to exclude [a male animal] which was with a woman and [a female animal] which was with a man that if they went up on the altar they must be taken down? They were already excluded by Scripture in the verse (1:2): “From an animal” in Parshas Vayikro. Since they were excluded there, [to teach] that they are not sanctified, why do we need the exclusion here — that if they went up on the altar they must be taken down? It is obvious that since they are not sanctified, they are not sacred, and certainly they must be taken down from the altar. The Sages already answered this in the Gemara (Nidah 41a), that [two verses are needed, one for a non-sacred animal that he tries to sanctify — that it will not be sanctified, and] one verse for a sanctified animal, that although he sanctified it originally, if it went up on the altar it must come down, [since it was invalidated in a way that could have happened before it became sanctified]. "
Leviticus 7:1,"[1]But its exchange is not. Meaning: The exchanged animal itself is not sacrificed, nevertheless, it becomes holy and does not go out to become non-sacred. It is left to graze until it develops a blemish. Then, it is sold and its value is used to buy a voluntary offering."
Leviticus 8:2,"[2]For there is no earlier. The erecting of the Mishkan was on Rosh Chodesh Nissan, and this was on the twenty-third of Adar. The explanation of (v. 35): “At the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall sit ... for seven days” is: In the place of the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, since for the entire seven days they would erect it and take it apart [and when it was taken apart there was no entrance’]. On Rosh Chodesh the Mishkan was erected and not taken apart, except during their travels. With words. This is not from an expression of לקיחה (taking); this has already been explained in Parshas Bereishis (20:15) and other places (Bereishis 43:15, and more)."
Leviticus 9:1,"[1] Eighth [day] of the installation. Since it is written at the end of Parshas Tzav: “At the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall sit day and night... Aharon and his sons fulfilled...” after which it is written: “And it was on the eighth day,” it surely refers to what came precedes it, those seven days, for we expound the juxtaposition [of the verses]. Furthermore, we can say that Scripture comes to elucidate and not to be unclear. Why, then, does it not specify which day it was? Rather, it must have been the eighth day (Rosh Chodesh Nison) of the installation, and it does not need to specify since it was juxtaposed to that verse. That very day. Rashi is answering the question: The verse comes to tell us when this happened, when it says: “And it was on the eighth day,” but we still do not know in which month the eighth day of installation was, or the date of the month. Because of this Rashi explains that it was Rosh Chodesh Nison. And Rashi means to say: The verse does not need to tell us that, for surely it was Rosh Chodesh Nison, because the Mishkon was erected on that very day, as it clearly says in Parshas Pekudei (Shemos 40:2). Since we have found that there was holiness on Rosh Chodesh Nison, then this [the eighth day of installation] was surely on Rosh Chodesh Nison as well, for we should assume that holiness occurs on a holy day. The verse relied on [this rationale], and it therefore did not specify the date. Additionally, Rashi is answering the question: How do we know the rationale to assume holiness occurs on a holy day — that [we should say] the verse relies on this logic? Therefore Rashi explains: And it took ten crowns which are taught in Seder Olom, i.e., we say in Seder Olam that this day took ten crowns. Why, though, did Hashem let it have all these virtues more than the other months? Perforce, it must be: This day was sanctified beforehand for the sake of the erection of the Mishkon, and we assume holiness occurs on a holy day. Took ten. For this reason it uses the indicative ה, the special eighth day, because of the ten crowns that it took. And they are: 1) The first day of the act of Creation, 2) first of the [Roshei] Chodashim, 3) first day of the princes’ [sacrifices], 4) first day of kehunah, 5) first day of Temple service, 6) of the fire descending, 7) of eating the sacrifices, 8) for the prohibition of individual altars, 9) for the presence of the Shechinoh in Yisroel, 10) for blessing the people of Yisroel. Entered and served. Rashi is answering the question: Why did he call the elders of Israel? We cannot say he wanted to speak to them so that they would tell the people of Israel to bring their offerings, because it is written afterwards (v. 3): “To Bnei Yisroel you [Aharon] shall speak, saying...” To the elders, however, Moshe said nothing! Therefore, Rashi explains: “To announce to them...” [You might ask:] Above, in the previous parshah, it is written (8:5): “Moshe said to the congregation, ‘This is the edict that Adonoy commanded,’” upon which Rashi explains: “You should not say that [it is] for my honor and for my brother’s honor [that] I do this.” If so, why does he need to announce to them a second time that it was by Divine command that Aharon entered to serve? The answer is: Here, Moshe came to let them know that it is by Divine command that Aharon entered to serve even as a kohein godol, which is a different service than the service of an ordinary kohein (Re’m). [Alternatively,] the answer is: There, it refers to what they did during the seven days of installation, but here it refers to what he did on the eighth day. This is why Moshe mentioned above: “[You should not say that it is] for my honor” and here he speaks on Aharon’s behalf alone (Nachalas Yaakov)."
Leviticus 10:2,"[2]Only because they rendered. This raises a difficulty: There is no [liability for] punishment without a warning! I will answer this difficulty in the next comment. Intoxicated with wine they entered. [According to this] the explanation of “which He had not commanded them” is not the reason for their deaths. Rather, it only informs that they volunteered themselves to bring the incense, and not that He commanded them, as He had commanded Aharon (9:2): “Take, for yourself, a young calf...” And the explanation of (16:1): “[After the death of two sons of Aharon] in their coming close (בקרבתם),” is: At the time of their bringing an offering, and not that they had died because of [using] a strange fire. Rather, the main reason for their death was because they were intoxicated with wine. If it were not that Hashem wanted to be sanctified by means of Nodov and Avihu, they would not have died now, even though death had already been decreed upon them at the time they peered [See Shemos 24:11, Rashi there: “They envisioned Hashem.” They (Nodov and Avihu) gazed at Him insolently while engaged in eating and drinking]. Similarly, they would not have died on this day which was a joyous occasion for Israel, if they had not rendered a halachic decision on this day. (See more about this in the following). Gur Aryeh answers that [although death was already decreed at the time of Matan Torah] since Hashem’s anger passes, as it is written (Yishayahu 26:20): “Hide for almost a moment, until the anger passes,” and since that anger had passed, another cause was necessary to be liable for death. Re’m poses another difficulty: They were liable for death from the time of the Golden Calf, as punishment for Aharon, and Moshe’s prayer only helped for half the decree — that two [of Aharon’s four] sons would die [see Rashi 10:12]. Nachalas Yaakov answers: According to the assumption that Aharon’s sons would die solely for the sin of the Golden Calf, Elozor and Isomor should have died, for they were presumably less righteous than, and they did not have as much merit as, Nodov and Avihu. Gur Aryeh answers: We find concerning the wicked that if they continue the deeds of their forefathers, Hashem punishes them for their forefathers’ deeds, so too, concerning a completely righteous person. If his son does any sin, Hashem punishes him for the deeds of his father, and if the son does not sin at all, Hashem does not bring the sin of the righteous man upon the son. This [concept] necessitates that when the sons sin, it is added to the forefathers’ sins and then the sons are punished even for the sin of the forefathers. [Thus,] the sin of the sons together [with the sin of the forefathers] causes the punishment. See Kitzur Mizrachi where he brings additional views: Rabbi Yossi HaGelili said: For drawing close, in which they entered the innermost (Holy of Holies) they died. Rabbi Akiva said: For drawing close, in that they brought a strange fire they died. Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah said: Because of both reasons they died. Bar Kappara said in the name of Rabbi Yirmeyah ben Eliezer: Because of four things they died: 1) For coming close, 2) for the offering that they brought without being commanded, 3) for the strange fire, a fire from the Beis HaKirayim (house of ovens), and 4) because they did not ask advice from one another. "
Leviticus 11:1,"[1]To tell Aharon. Thirteen instances of “speaking” are recorded in the Torah [directed] to Moshe and Aharon, and thirteen exclusions corresponding to them, [in order] to teach you that Hashem did not speak to Aharon but to Moshe alone, as mentioned above in Parshas Vayikro. Although Rashi already explains above in Parshas Vayikro (1:1), he explains here again so that you will not explain that as a reward for “Aharon was silent” Aharon merited that the Divine word was specially [directed] to him alone, together with Moshe, as he merited regarding the laws of those intoxicated by wine. Furthermore, we can explain that although in general the Divine word was spoken simultaneously by the two of them — that was when they spoke to Israel. Here, however, Moshe told Aharon that he alone would be the messenger to tell them (Nachalas Yaakov). "
Leviticus 12:2,"[2]In the Work of Creation. You might ask: Why did the creation of animals and beasts precede the creation of man? The Sages already answered in Sanhedrin (38a): “Why was man created on Erev Shabbos? So that they [i.e., the heretics] would not say Hashem had a partner in the Work of Creation. Another explanation: Because if man would be haughty they can say to him: The mosquito preceded you. Another explanation: So that he would immediately become obligated in a mitzvah [Shabbos]. Another explanation: So that he would find everything immediately prepared for his meal. This can be compared to a king...” You might ask: If the Torah explains according to the order of creation, then Parshas Metzoro should come before Parshas Ki Tazria, because Metzoro speaks of a man and Tazria speaks of a woman, and Adam was created before Chavah! The answer is: It is more common for a woman gives birth than for a man to become afflicted with tzora’as. Furthermore, we can say: The reason Tazria comes before Metzoro is because the main reason a person is afflicted with tzora’as is because he has relations with his wife when she is a menstruant, as the Gemara says (Erachin 16a, and Tanchuma Tazria 11). Another answer: The woman is compared to the earth’s soil, which causes what is planted (שזורעים) in it to grow. Man, as well, was created from the earth’s soil. Therefore, it is written regarding a woman: “When [a woman] conceives (תזריע) and gives birth to a male child,” i.e., the male is created from the female who is likened to the earth’s soil. This raises a difficulty: What practical difference does this comparison make? Furthermore, Re’m raised the difficulty that the Gemora says in Sanhedrin (38a) that the reason Adam was created last was so that if he would be haughty it can be said to him: The mosquito preceded you in the work of creation, and so that he would find everything prepared for his meal, [and more reasons,] all of which are not applicable here! He also asks: Why does it mention the law [of tzora’as]: “When a man will have in the skin of his flesh” after the law pertaining to a woman: “When [a woman] conceives”? The woman was created last! It appears to me the answer is: All this is what R. Simlai [who is cited in Rashi] means to say: Just as there is a good reason why Adam was created last — so that he would come and find everything ready for his meal — so too, regarding the law of man: It was explained after the laws of animals, beasts and birds, i.e., with regard to what is forbidden and permitted [among them]. This follows what it says in the Midrash (Vayikro Rabboh 13:3) on the verse (11:2): “These are the living things” — “Every word of Hashem is refined” (Mishlei 30:5), “The mitzvos were given to Israel” — i.e., what is forbidden to be eaten — “only for the sake of refining the people with them.” In this way Hashem demonstrates his love for us, as it says in the Midrash that someone who loves his servant cautions him from eating harmful food. Therefore, R. Simlai said that just as Adam was created last at the time of Creation for his advantage, so that he find his provisions prepared, so too, regarding Torah and mitzvos, Hashem gave them to Israel for their benefit, to refine them. Therefore, mankind was mentioned last so that they would have the refinement of mitzvos by means of the laws pertaining to animals, beasts and birds. Therefore, there is no difficulty posed from: “When a man will have, in the skin of his flesh” [the law of tzora’as of a man is mentioned after the section dealing with a woman], for there [the concept of] refinement is not relevant (Divrei Dovid). Mushy. [Rashi knows this] because it should only say: “When a woman gives birth to a male child.” [Why does it add “conceives”?] Rather, this comes to include even [when the embryo] is born mushy. One should not object: [The Rabbis taught (Berachos 60a)]: This teaches that if a woman emits seed first [the child will be a male, thus,] it is needed for that! [The answer is:] If so, it should say: “כי תזריע האשה וילדה זכר.” Rather, it juxtaposes “conception” to “giving birth” and writes וילדה זכר with a ו, which indicates certainty, and does not write “if,” the way it does (v. 5): “If she gives birth to a female.” Perforce you have both [explanations]. [You might ask:] Rashi explains above in Parshas Vayigash (Bereishis 46:15): “These are the sons of Leah... along with his daughter Deenah.” — “The males are attributed to Leah while the females are attributed to Yaakov, to teach you that if the woman emits seed first then she will give birth to a male [and if the man emits seed first then she will give birth to a female].” Why is this needed? It is derived from here! The answer is: From here we can only derive that a woman who emits seed [first] gives birth [to a male], however, [it is inconclusive in the event] the man emits seed first or they both emit simultaneously, that she will give birth to a female. Therefore, Scripture lets us know: “along with his daughter Deenah,” that if they [both] emit seed simultaneously they each cancel the other [and she will give birth to a male or female]. And from there alone, however, it cannot be derived, because we can say Scripture attributes the males to Leah because it cannot attribute them to Yaakov, who had other male children, [and if it said “these are the sons of Yaakov” I might think that these alone are the sons of Yaakov]. The female [Deenah] was attributed to him, though, since he had no other daughter besides her. [Thus,] from both [verses] it is derived well. Re’m dwelt at length on this but I shortened it (Minchas Yehudah). As semen. Rashi’s explanation implies that first, before it was born, it was somewhat formed as a fetus, but afterwards it became crushed. [He knows this] from what is written, “when [a woman] conceives,” which implies even if she only gave birth to something resembling semen. But it is written, “and gives birth to a male child,” implying that it was a fully formed embryo. How [can this be resolved]? Perforce, we must say that originally it was a fully formed fetus, but afterwards it was crushed and became as semen. Mentioned in regard to a menstruant woman. She causes impurity due to lying down or sitting, as does a menstruant woman, and all the laws of impurity apply to her. You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps the verse means: “as the days of her menstrual flow” — which is seven days — so too, the amount of impurity for childbirth is seven days. The answer is: This would not require a verse, for it clearly says: “she will be ritually unclean for seven days.” If so, why does it say: “as the days of her menstrual flow”? Rather, it comes to teach about other [laws of menstrual] impurity. You might ask: This is obvious! She is a menstruant woman, for at the time of her difficulty [in birth] she saw blood. Therefore, Rashi explains: “even if the womb opens without blood.” Which flows. [Rashi knows this] because the ז is interchangeable with the ד, as [we see from the fact that] the Aramaic translation of זב (discharge flow) is דב (15:2) [and the ו and the ב are interchangeable since they have the same source of pronunciation]. If so, it is as if Scripture had written זבותה (her flow). "
Leviticus 13:2,"[2]A Scriptural decree. Rashi’s view is so because it is written nearby: “He shall be brought to Aharon, the kohein, or to one of his sons, the kohanim.” Why does it need to say, “one”? Also, Scripture does not need to write, “of his sons, the kohanim,” but rather only: “Or to his sons.” Thus, “one” comes to include even a non-kohein, [in the case] that the kohein was ignorant of Torah law he may show [the signs] to a man who knows [the laws of] signs of impurity, although he is a non-kohein. And that which it is written afterwards, “of his sons the kohanim” is to teach that although the kohein does not know the signs of impurity, and needs to show [them] to a Torah scholar who may not be a kohein, nevertheless, the Torah scholar is not allowed to say: This is a sign of impurity or this is a sign of purity. Rather, he must teach the kohein the laws of impurity and purity so that the kohein will tell the person who has the skin-eruption: You are pure or impure. Upon this Rashi explains: “It is a Scriptural decree...”"
Leviticus 14:2,"[2]That we do not proclaim him pure at night. You might ask: Why does Scripture need to write, “on the day of his purification”? It is written elsewhere (7:38): “On the day that he commanded” — in the day but not at night. The answer is: If it did not write, “on the day of his purification,” I might think that since his sacrifice is different than any other sacrifice, in that it requires waving while [the animal is] alive (v. 12), then its law is different as well. Therefore, it needed [to say,] “on the day of his purification” (so I found)."
Leviticus 15:2,"[2]Perhaps [a discharge] flowing from anywhere. Meaning: [I might think] even a flow from his mouth or nostrils or ears should be impure. [The Torah] declared a male with a discharge unclean and a female with a discharge unclean. If the verse did not distinguish, I might think that a [discharge] flowing from anywhere should be impure, even if it flows from the mouth or from the ear or from the nostrils. We cannot derive through a gezeiroh shovoh from a female, because we can refute: What [special characteristic does] a female have [that causes the law]? Because she becomes impure as a zovoh only through three sightings [of discharge] on three consecutive days to require seven clean [days] and an offering. However, three sightings on one day does not impart the law of zovoh. A male, on the other hand, has the law of zov even with three sightings on one day. If so, I might think [a discharge] flowing from anywhere would make him impure. However, now that the verse reveals: “from his flesh” — and not all his flesh — that [a discharge] flowing from anywhere does not make a zov impure, nevertheless, we do not yet know from which flesh a discharge flowing renders him impure and from which flesh a discharge flowing leaves him pure. [Therefore Rashi explains:] “I may argue...” With a less severe impurity — נדה. Rashi calls נדה a less severe impurity because it does not require seven clean [days] and an offering, which is not the case regarding zovoh gedolah (a female who has had three sightings on three consecutive days), who requires seven clean [days] and an offering. A drop [of discharge] that it causes impurity. You might ask: This is obvious! The zov becomes impure from that same drop of impurity with such a severe impurity that it causes impurity to people and vessels. Is it not more so that the drop [itself] causes impurity? The answer is: If Rashi did not explain I would have said that the drop does not cause impurity, because we can learn from the goat that is sent away — the one who deals with it becomes impure and causes impurity to others, but it itself is not impure. I might think that the same applies to a flow [of discharge], and therefore Rashi explains: “This teaches in regard to a drop...” And dissolved. ודחוי means thin. To the white of an egg which is crushed. Meaning: [An egg] from a hen that rubbed on the ground and not from a male. Rashi means to say that you should not be troubled: Since its impurity is so severe that even one drop of the zov causes impurity, how will we know if one drop discharges from him? Perhaps it is a drop of semen and he is pure, or [perhaps] a zov and he is impure. Upon this Rashi explains: “[This] discharge resembles water of dough...” "
Leviticus 16:1,"[1]In a damp place. טחב refers to any place that cools or dampens [a person]. The explanation of the verses is as follows. Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture write, “And Adonoy spoke to Moshe” [and then repeat, “Adonoy spoke to Moshe.”] It should merely have written, “After the death [of two sons of Aharon] ... Adonoy spoke to Moshe, Speak to your brother Aharon...” Alternatively, it should have written, “And Adonoy spoke to Moshe after the death [of two sons of Aharon]... Speak to [your brother] Aharon... Why does it write [“And Adonoy spoke to Moshe,” and then repeat], “Adonoy spoke to Moshe.” Regarding this Rashi explains: “Why does the verse say [this]...” He then cites the parable of Rabbi Elazar in order to say that the verse is like this parable... And thus, “This [second speaking to him clearly] urged him on more than the first one.” The verse, too, means the same when it is written, “And Adonoy spoke to Moshe” [and repeats it]. [The first time the verse says “And Adonoy spoke to Moshe], means [that He instructed] Moshe to only tell Aharon not to come into the Holy that is inside of the curtain and not to mention [that he can incur] death similar to the death of his sons. Afterwards, the verse writes “After the death ... Adonoy said to Moshe...” meaning that the Holy One spoke again to Moshe to tell Aharon something else — he should warn him a second time to not come into the Holy, and [this time] also mention the death [of his sons] as it is written, “After the death of two sons of Aharon ... Adonoy spoke to Moshe, Speak to your brother Aharon ... so that he not die.” I.e., if you do not come into the Holy you will not die as your sons died, but if you come into the Holy as your sons did, you too will die like them. Re’m’s text of Rashi is different, see there. Aharon’s sons did not die for entering the Holy of Holies, the place where Aharon was forbidden to enter at all times. If so, what proof does the death of his sons serve to support this warning? The verse means as follows: Aharon should not enter [the Holy of Holies] at all times in order not to die as his sons died when they entered a place forbidden to them. Similarly, he should not enter a place that is forbidden to him. (Kitzur Mizrachi) "
Leviticus 17:3,"[3]This verse speaks of consecrated [animals]. Explanation: the verse is speaking about consecrated animals that were slaughtered outside [the Temple courtyard]. (Gur Aryeh) You cannot say the verse is saying that [even] unconsecrated animals slaughtered outside would make one liable for excision, as we find no commandment against this. You might ask that the Gemara Chulin (16b) says, “Originally, flesh of desire [i.e., unconsecrated animals killed in order to enjoy their meat] was forbidden,” and Rashi explains, “Because it is written, ’Each and every person [of the House of Israel] who will slaughter an ox, lamb, or goat etc.,” indicating that our verse is talking about unconsecrated animals? It seems to me that the correct way to explain Rashi is as follows: The main subject of the verse is not unconsecrated animals because the verse makes one liable for excision, and there is no penalty of excision regarding unconsecrated animals. However, because Scripture writes in general terms, “Each and every person of the House of Israel who will slaughter an ox, lamb, or goat,” instead of writing, “who will slaughter a burnt-offering or a sacrifice,” this indicates that no animal may be slaughtered outside because “meat of desire” was forbidden to them. Because no animal may be slaughtered outside as meat of desire was forbidden to them, the verse did not write, “who will slaughter a burnt-offering or a sacrifice,” as that would have implied that other meat is permitted to slaughter outside. Therefore, since nothing may be slaughtered [anywhere] except for consecrated animals, because they were forbidden to eat meat of desire, the verse did not need to specify consecrated animals and wrote in general terms, “who will slaughter an ox, lamb, or goat.” Outside the [Temple] courts. I.e., when it is written “within the encampment” here, it does not mean the priestly encampment, i.e., within the Temple courts, making someone liable for excision if he slaughtered a sacrifice outside its correct place north of the altar. [This is not so], because even if one slaughtered in the south, what liability would there be for this, so long as he slaughtered within the Temple courts? [The Toras Kohanim derives from the words “beyond the encampment.” See Re’m]. Therefore it means outside the Temple courts. "
Leviticus 18:2,"[2]A Judge who will exact punishment. (Re’m) Because [the expression] אלהים represents the attribute of justice, i.e., to punish sins. [Whereas the expression] ה' represents the attribute of mercy, i.e., to forgive sins if a person repents, and to reward one for mitzvos. (Nachalas Yaakov) Re’m did not remember what Rashi writes at the beginning of parshas Va’eira, “’I am Adonoy,’ ([denoting] that He may be relied upon to exact retribution), etc.” We see that Rashi derives this from “I,” without regard to the expression אלהיכם. See there."
Leviticus 19:2,"[2]During an assembly. You might ask: Moshe taught the whole Torah to Israel as Rashi says in parshas Ki Sisa. The answer is: This parshah was said to them in an assembly of women and children [too] as it is written, “the entire congregation [of] Bnei Yisroel,” and [also] as it is written in parshas Vayeilech (Devarim 31:12), “Assemble the people — the men and the women and the infants.” But [generally], Moshe taught the men only. Another answer is: Moshe [generally] taught them in groups, one after the other, but this parshah was in the assembly of all Israel. The difference [of teaching in this manner] was that no one could say, “I do not accept this mitzvah because I have questions against it, and the reason I did not ask Moshe immediately is because not all Israel were present there.” Therefore, [here] all Israel were together so that no one could say this. [See Re’m] From sexual crimes. Because [one may have thought that] holiness is only discernable in Jews when they are separate and apart from the nations, through acts like tzitzis, etc., and tefillin and [by keeping] other positive commandments. But separation is not discernable by keeping negative commandments. And he explains: “Separate yourselves etc.,” meaning that this [command] applies even to sexual prohibitions mentioned above. When Rashi says “from transgression,” he also means the transgression of sexual prohibitions. "
Leviticus 20:2,"[2]The punishments for the prohibitions. Rashi is answering the question that all these negative commandments are already written in parshas Acharei Mos. He answers that above Scripture wrote the prohibitions, and here it is writing the punishment for [violating] the prohibitions. The people of the land shall assist them. Because if “the people of the land shall stone him to death” was the explanation of “he shall surely be put to death,” let the verse omit it and not write “he shall surely be put to death.” For whose sake. Because if not so, why write “of the land”? It should have said, “The people shall stone him, etc.” (Maharam). This [answer, that the land, i.e., the world, was created for their sake] is insufficient because if so, it should have said “people of the world.” And this [second answer] is also insufficient because if so, the verse should have said explicitly that it is talking about Eretz Yisroel. But because it writes [“the land”] in general terms, this implies the whole world. You might ask, why did Rashi not explain this above in parshas Vayikra (4:27) where it is written, “(If a person should unwittingly sin [and he is]) one of the ordinary people (עם הארץ), by transgressing [one of the commandments of Adonoy that should not be done and he incurs guilt]”? The answer is that above the explanation is according to its plain meaning, anyone from the whole nation of Yisroel, whether a kohein, a Levi, or a regular Jew, as Ibn Ezra explains. One cannot explain the same here, because why would one think there is any distinction, and thus [here] it should have said “the nation.” You cannot explain that it means “in the assembly of them all,” because if so it should have said “the entire congregation (כל העדה)” as it says in parshas Emor (Vayikra 24:14) regarding a blasphemer. (R. Yaakov Taryosh) "
Leviticus 21:1,"[1]Say (אמור), and you shall say. The verse should only have written, “Speak, to the kohanim.” Therefore [the apparent redundancy teaches us that], “speak” is to warn [the adult kohanim] themselves, “and you shall say” is to warn the adults regarding the minors. You might ask why Rashi does not also say this answer [regarding the verse] “Speak (דבר) (to the entire congregation [of] Bnei Yisroel) and say (אמרת) (to them)” in parshas Kedoshim (Vayikra 19:2). The answer is that דבור is a general [command to speak] and does not explain what the statement will be, while אמרת implies something specific, i.e., say this [particular] thing. Here however, where אמור is [already] specific, Rashi is asking why one needs [a command to say] two specific [statements]. The verse says: The kohanim. You might ask, why does Rashi explain the verse in reverse order? He should have first explained “the sons of Aharon” and then [explained] “you shall say to them.” You might also ask, how does he derive all these lessons from “the sons of Aharon”? The answer is that Rashi is explaining as follows: Once I have explained that “you shall say to them” is to “to warn the adults regarding the minors,” why then does the verse need to write “the kohanim, the sons of Aharon”? Without [the first explanation regarding minors] there would be no difficulty as I could say that, if it wrote “the kohanim” and not “the sons of Aharon,” I would think the law only applied to adults and not to minors. Therefore it had to write “the sons of Aharon” in order “to warn the adults regarding the minors.” But now that I derived this from “you shall say to them,” you might ask, why write “the kohanim”? Rashi answers, if it wrote “the sons of Aharon” and not “the kohanim,” I would think even those who are unfit. Therefore the verse says “the kohanim,” i.e., he must be a complete kohein. Rashi then answers another question. How can you explain that “the kohanim” excludes those who are unfit? Perhaps it is needed [for something else], since if it did not write “the kohanim,” but only “the sons of Aharon,” I would think they must be perfect like the sons of Aharon, and it would exclude those who are blemished. Therefore you need “the kohanim” to include the blemished. [To this] Rashi answers that “the sons of Aharon” implies the blemished as well and therefore this would not answer why the verse writes “the kohanim.” Rather, you need it as I answered above, to exclude the unfit. Rashi then answers why the verse writes “the sons of Aharon.” It should only have written “the kohanim” and from that I could exclude the unfit and include the blemished, because both of these [laws] are implied in the word “the kohanim.” He answers that if it did not say “the sons of Aharon,” I would think that even daughters of Aharon are implied in “the kohanim,” because wherever the Torah writes a masculine term, women are also included. Therefore it has to write “the sons of Aharon” and exclude the daughters of Aharon. See Mizrachi who explains in a different way, as follows: You need them both because if it only wrote “the sons of Aharon,” it would imply even the unfit and if so, there would be no exclusionary phrase for the unfit, and they would be included in “sons of Aharon.” [Therefore] it writes “the kohanim” to exclude the unfit. [Rashi] then says, from where do you include even the blemished? Because the verse says “the sons of Aharon.” I.e., there is no exclusionary phrase to exclude them as “the kohanim” came to exclude the unfit, and therefore “the sons of Aharon” implies that even the blemished [should be included]. Thus we are left with a situation where “the sons of Aharon” includes the blemished and [the Torah writes the phrase] to exclude the daughters of Aharon. Whereas if it were only written “the kohanim” one would have thought that women kohanim are included because men and women are [generally] treated the same regarding all the punishments of the Torah. You cannot say the other way round, which would be stringent [as follows]: “’The kohanim.’ You might think, but not the unfit, so the verse says ’the son of Aharon,’ and even the unfit are included in the sons of Aharon.” Because if so, for what would you use the exclusionary expression “the kohanim.” Among his people. Because if not so, why say “among his people?” Therefore, it is saying [that this law only applies] when the deceased is among his people and there are many people involved in his burial. Excluding a mes mitzvoh. I.e., [when] there is no one to bury [the deceased], he is permitted to become defiled and bury the deceased. A mes mitzvoh is every case where one [the finder of the body] calls [for help] and no one responds. (Gur Aryeh) Re’em raises a difficulty: Why do we need a verse to permit mes mitzvoh? Why not derive this from the Kohein Godol and nazir who may defile themselves for a mes mitzvoh even though they may not defile themselves for their relatives. How much more so should a regular kohein who does defile himself for his relatives be permitted to defile himself for a mes mitzvoh. Should his being a regular kohein make the law more stringent for him than that of a Kohein Godol? It seems that if not for [this] verse, I would think that the verse “he shall not become [ritually] impure” [said of the Kohein Godol] means that he may not defile himself for no purpose, [and is] not [speaking about] for the sake of a mitzvah. But to deal with a corpse in order to bury it, where there is a mitzvah, he is permitted, and it is only forbidden when not for the purpose of a mitzvah. Therefore the Torah writes regarding the regular kohein that whenever the dead body is “among his people” he may not defile himself, and if so, the leniency of the Kohein Godol [too] is [only in] a case of mes mitzvoh that has no one to bury the deceased. But if there are people available to bury the deceased, he is forbidden to become defiled for it even though he would be performing a mitzvah [by doing so]. "
Leviticus 22:2,"[2]Reverse the verse. I.e., “And let them keep away from the holy offerings of Bnei Yisroel which they sanctify for Me.” But not as the verse is written. If you do not reverse the verse, and “which they sanctify for Me” is written after “and they shall not profane,” and “which they sanctify for Me” comes “to include the holy offerings of the kohanim themselves,” as Rashi soon explains, the verse would be unclear. Because we could explain that the negative command of “and they shall not profane” also refers to “which they sanctify for Me [i.e., the sacrifices of the kohanim].” On the other hand [we could explain that] if “which they sanctify to Me” refers [only] to “I am Hashem,” and that the verse means as follows: “And let them keep away from the holy offerings of Bnei Yisroel and they shall not profane My holy name.” However, regarding those “which they sanctify for Me [i.e., the kohein’s own sacrifices], I am Hashem,” [ready] to punish them, but they will not transgress [the negative command of] “they shall not profane, etc.” (Re’m). But I discovered in a corrected text that the words “another alternative interpretation” in Rashi’s text above [in the text of Sifsei Chochomim, the words “another alternative interpretation” appeared just before our current Rashi], are a copyist’s error and one should move the words “another alternative interpretation” below. And this is the [correct] text: “They shall separate [themselves] from holy things in the days of their impurity. ’And let them keep away from the holy offerings, etc., and not profane My Holy Name.’ Reverse the verse and expound it. An alternative interpretation. ’Which (they sanctify for Me), etc.’.” I heard that this [alternative interpretation] should be explained as follows: According to the first interpretation, Rashi is explaining that [the phrase] “And let them keep away from the holy offerings of Bnei Yisroel” refers to days when [a kohein] is impure. But according to the alternative interpretation where Rashi explains “They shall separate themselves” [in a new way], he means that the verse [“which they sanctify for Me”] is referring to an animal that was sanctified for a sacrifice. The kohanim are commanded not to not eat them but to offer them on the altar. [The verse says this] so that you do not say, since sacrifices are permitted to kohanim after their organs [of the animal] have been sacrificed, if so, once an animal has been sanctified, it too should be permitted [immediately]. Therefore the Torah commands against this. This is why Rashi reverses the verse and expounds it as if it is written, “And let them keep away from the holy offerings of Bnei Yisroel, which they sanctify for Me,” so that [according to the alternative interpretation, the verse] is referring to a person declaring [that an animal is] sanctified [as an offering, and is commanding the kohanim not to not eat such an animal before it is sacrificed]. "
Leviticus 23:2,"[2]That [the Sanhedrin] proclaims a leap year. This is the correct text: “Regulate the appointed times so that [the] Israel[ites] should become knowledgeable in them,” i.e., they should become used to coming up [to Jerusalem] on the festivals. He then explains how [it is regulated]. “[The Sanhedrin] proclaims a leap year, etc.” Since the [people]y were uprooted from their place they [Sanhedrin] proclaim a leap year, because if they do not proclaim a leap year, they [people] will be unable to come up and reach Jerusalem until after the festival., and t The following year they will not want to come up for the festival, thinking that that they will be unable to reach Jerusalem before the festival. Therefore they proclaim a leap year. See Sanhedrin 11a. "
Leviticus 24:3,"[3]The westernmost lamp. Gur Aryeh writes: Re’m asks: how does one reconcile the Rabbis’ exposition with the “Curtain of Testimony”? The curtain does not serve as a curtain for the westernmost lamp, which [according to the Rabbis] is called a testimony! The answer is as follows: The curtain is called the “Curtain of Testimony” since it was next to the ark that holds the Tablets of Testimony which are a testimony between the Holy One and Yisroel. However, the Rabbis are explaining why the Torah specifically writes the “Curtain of Testimony” here [where the Torah speaks of the menorah]. They explain that only through the westernmost lamp from which the kohein begins and where he ends, is it evident that the curtain is a “Curtain of Testimony.” The “Tablets of Testimony” alone are no proof to this testimony, since they do not demonstrate that the Divine Presence still dwells in the midst of Yisroel, as perhaps it no longer dwells in Yisroel. Thus, we need the westernmost lamp to demonstrate that the curtain is a “Curtain of Testimony” and that the Tablets are a testimony between the Holy One and Yisroel that the Divine Presence still dwells in the midst of Yisroel. [Alternatively], even if you say that the word “testimony” here refers to the westernmost lamp there is no difficulty, because the Torah says that the menorah should be next to the curtain as it says, “outside of the Curtain of Testimony,” from which Toras Kohanim derives that the menorah must be closer to the curtain than it is to the entrance. Therefore, since the menorah is at the curtain and close to the curtain, it is appropriate to call the curtain the “Curtain of Testimony” because they are together. And with it he would end. I.e., when he began lighting the lamps in the evening, he would first light the westernmost lamp. And when he came to set up the lamps in the morning he would set them all up and the westernmost lamp would still be burning; he would take out the burning wicks out and set [them] up. However, this lamp he only set up in the evening and he would put into it the same amount of oil as the other lamps. So explains Rashi in Perek Bameh Madlikin (Shabbos 22b)."
Leviticus 25:1,"[1]Their general rules and specifications. You might ask: How does Rashi know that all of them [including] their general rules and specifications were said at Sinai? Obviously, because the superfluous words “on Mount Sinai” indicate that the general rules and specifications were said at Mount Sinai. But perhaps this only comes to teach [the laws] of about the Sabbatical year itself, and not about other mitzvos? Also, regarding [the claim that these words are superfluous] itself you can object, from where [does Rashi know this]? Perhaps [the verse writes] “on Mount Sinai” so that you do not say that “(And Hashem spoke to him from) the Tent of Meeting” written at the beginning of parshas Vayikra refers to all the parshiyos after parshas Vayikra, and therefore it writes “on Mount Sinai” here? The answer is: This is why Rashi writes “And it seems to me, etc.” He means as follows: Since we do not find that [the laws of] shemittoh of the land whose general rules principles were taught at Sinai were repeated at the Plains of Moab in Sefer Devorim., Tthis could make lead one to mistakenly say that all the mitzvos were repeated taught at the Plains of Moav because of their details and specifications, and are [thus] not from Sinai. Even though it is written later at the end of Vayikra (27:34), “These are the commandments which Hashem commanded Moshe for Bnei Yisroel on Mount Sinai,” which implies that all the mitzvos are from Sinai, this may apply only to the general rules of mitzvos but not to their details. However, since the Sabbatical year is not repeated there except in the hint of “Suspend (every creditor’s hand from his loan to his neighbor)” (Devorim 15:2), if so, its general rules and details must all have been said at Sinai. If so, why does the verse here [superfluously] say “Mount Sinai”? It must be to teach us that every utterance which was prophetically said to Moshe, that all of them were from Sinaiùtheir general rules and their specifications. And [the Sabbatical year] is an example that applies to the entire Torah."
Leviticus 26:1,"[1]Since my master commits sexual crimes. You might ask: I can understand [why Rashi mentions] idolatry and Shabbos [as they] are written here, in the verses of this section. But why does Rashi mention sexual crimes which are not mentioned in this section? The answer is: Even though the verses do not mention sexual crimes, it they hints at them by mentioning idolatry. As the Midrash says, “’Your two breasts, etc.’ (Shir Hashirim 4). [This hints] that the two Tablets correlated one to another, with one command corresponding to [the opposite] command. ’Do not commit adultery’ (Shemos 20:13) corresponding to ’You must not have any other gods’ (verse 3),” i.e., idolatry. Alternatively, this is based on the sages’ statement that Yisroel served idolatry only for the purpose of permitting immorality for themselves. Rashi mentions Shabbos since whoever desecrates Shabbos is considered as if he denied God’s Creation of heaven and earth, [which is like idolatry]. Alternatively, the master might buy the slave for homosexuality, which is a sexual crime.If he does not repent. (Gur Aryeh) Re’m asks: Why does the verse mention a “foreign family” (verse 27)? If he is sold to idol worship itself (see Rashi there), how much more [will he be sold] to a non-Jew? I do not understand this question, as Re’m should [also] have asked, why does the verse (ibid.) mention a “resident foreigner”? If he is sold to a non-Jew, how much more to a foreign resident, so why write “foreign resident”? However, the verse writes them all for the reason Rashi says, that the Holy does not bring them all onto upon him at once. So if it wrote “offspring” [i.e. idol worship] (verse 27), I would think that he was sold to the “offspring” first. But the Holy One does not do so; rather He brings it onto upon him gradually.The spreading out of hands and feet. You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps it is forbidden even in the Temple? The answer is: It is written in the verse, “A prostration stone you shall not set in your land upon which to prostrate oneself,” which implies that the Torah forbade this in your land, but did not forbid it in the Temple."
Leviticus 27:2,"[2]On which the soul depends. [This comes] to exclude a hand or a leg upon which the soul does not depend, [e.g.,] if he said, “the worth of [his] hand or leg [is incumbent upon me],” it is as if he said nothing and he is absolved from making payment."
