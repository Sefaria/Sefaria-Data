Numbers 2:2," Each one's color.@bo Thus the meaning of “their fathers’ houses” was the names of their fathers that were engraved on the breastplate. But since this is a forced explanation in the understanding of “their fathers’ houses,” Rashi gives another explanation. Nonetheless, according to the other explanation one may question the connection between the word “banner” and “the insignia of their fathers’ houses,” therefore he also needs the first explanation. @d1When they carried him.@bo Meaning that accordingly one must say that “banner” is a term of gathering as in “@hh ודגלו עלי@ee (and encamped around me)” (Shir HaShirim 2:4). This teaches that each banner was with its group. @d1At the distance of a @BImil@bo. One might ask: Previously in Parshas Yisro (Shemos 19:2), Rashi explained that@hh נגד ההר @ee (opposite the mountain) meant to its east, because any time that you find the word@hh נגד @ee it implies facing east, even if it comes as a construct (opposite @ITsomething@it). The answer is: Here it is written “around the Tent of Meeting they shall encamp” so it is not possible that they were all facing east. Thus Rashi explains that it is a term of distance. Furthermore, I have found that one may learn this through a gezeirah shavah (comparison); the Torah here says @hh מנגד@ee (opposite) and elsewhere it says @hh ותשב מנגד הרחק@ee (“and sat facing him about the distance”) (Bereishis 21:16). Thus, just as there it refers to distance, so too here it refers to the distance. @eeA @ITmil@it is a distance of two thousand @ITamos@it [the maximum distance] that one may travel on Shabbos. "
Numbers 3:1," Since he taught them what he had learned.@bo Otherwise [i.e. if the Torah did not say this], what relevance does this point have here. Thus Rashi explains that @hh ביום דיבר@ee (lit. @ITon@it the day that He spoke) means “@ITfrom@it the day that He spoke,” and that the letter @ITbeis@it is like the @ITbeis@it in@hh והנותר בבשר ובלחם @ee (that which is left @ITfrom@it the meat and @ITfrom@it the bread) (Vayikro 8:32). It was not on the day that Hashem spoke to Moshe on Har Sinai that he taught them, rather from that day onwards he taught them and thus they became his descendants. One might ask: Surely all of Israel learned Torah from Moshe, so why were they not [also] called his descendants? The answer is: When he taught Torah to the whole of Yisroel it was at the command of Hashem, as it is written “Hashem said to Moshe come up to me . . . that I wrote to instruct them” (Shemos 24:12). This implies that the main reason for Hashem teaching Moshe was for [Moshe to teach] the people of Yisroel. Therefore it is not correct to say that [regarding them that] “one who teaches another’s son . . .” However regarding Aharon’s sons, Moshe was not obligated to teach them, given that only a father is obligated to teach his son Torah, therefore they were called the descendants of Moshe. This appears to the precise meaning of the wording “anyone who teaches @ITanother’s@it son Torah . . .” "
Numbers 4:2," For the service of carrying.@bo Rashi intends to explain the reason for the count: All those enumerated are normally counted from one month, from twenty or from thirteen years of age, but this number is not similar to any other. Therefore he explains “count those among them suited . . .” @ITRe’m@it. "
Numbers 5:2," This Parshah was said on the day.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why didn’t he command them this Parshah immediately after the Mishkon was erected? Surely they arranged the camps on the day that the Mishkon was erected, and immediately afterwards he should have commanded them to send everyone who was impure out of the camp. He answers that it was indeed said on the day that the Mishkon was erected. Rashi is also answering another question: Where do we find that that any other Parshah was said to them on the day that the Mishkon was erected? He answers that “eight parshiyos . . .” @d1Three camps.@bo Because it wrote the word “camp” three times in this Parshah. @d1Out of all of them.@bo Regarding the metzoro the Torah writes “he shall dwell alone” (Vayikra 13:46) implying that he should dwell in a place where no other impure people go, i.e. outside the three camps. When the Torah wrote “and they shall not defile their camps,” (v.3) rather than writing “their camp” this implies that there was one camp for a zav and another camp for a person defiled by the dead. Now, since one defiled by the dead is permitted in the Levite camp, as explained previously, one may infer that a zav is permitted in the Israelite camp. @d1From the encampment of the Shechinah.@bo You might ask: From where did Rashi know this? The answer is that the fact that one defiled by the dead is even permitted in the Levite camp is learned from Moshe Rabbeinu who was himself a Levi. The Torah writes “Moshe took the bones of Yosef with him” (Shemos 13:19) and he entered the camp of the Levites. @d1Means . . . bones.@bo Meaning that the opinion of the Targum is that they were defiled through the bone of a corpse. @ITRe’m@it explains Rashi’s proof: Had this been a term meaning impurity, a person who touched someone who became impure from a corpse would have also been rendered an @ITav hatumoh@it (‘father’ i.e. originator of impurity) since [the verse would mean that] a person who touched someone who became impure from a corpse is commanded here to be sent out of the camp like a zav or a metzoro, which are both @ITavos hatumoh@it. However this is not so, because a person who touches someone who became impure through touching a corpse only becomes a @ITvlad hatumoh@it (‘offspring’ of impurity). Thus one is forced to say that “defiled by a [departed] soul” refers to bones. A bone is an @ITavi avos hatumoh@it (‘father of a father’ of impurity) and one who touches it becomes an @ITav hatumoh@it. You might ask: How did Rashi know this, perhaps the verse means that he was rendered impure by flesh rather than a bone. An answer is that if this was so the Torah should have written @hh טמא בנפש@ee (defiled @ITby@it a soul), but what is meant by @hh טמא לנפש@ee (lit. defiled @ITto@it a soul) — this implies that he was rendered impure by something connected to the soul — and this is the bones. Another answer is that it was because the Targum translates @hh דמסאב לטמי נפשא@ee (who were defiled by the bones of a soul) whereas he should have merely translated it as @hh דמסאב נפשא@ee (defiled by a soul). However the additional word @hh לטמי@ee implies bones. "
Numbers 6:2," That whoever observes a sotah.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why was this not been placed next to the passage of Nedarim (vows), which is its fitting place? @ITRe’m@it explains that there is no association whatsoever to the passage of the sotah, for she transgressed [one of] the Ten Commandments while the Nazirite sanctified himself, abstaining from that which was permitted to him. Therefore Rashi asks why this passage was placed here, even though such a question is not normal for Rashi. @d1In her decadence.@bo Meaning how they degraded her, as it writes, “and expose her hair” (5:18). "
Numbers 7:1," Because he utterly dedicated.@bo It appears that Rashi is answering the question: The notation above the words “Moshe finished” separate it from the words “erecting the Mishkon” meaning that “Moshe finished” is not to be read together with “erecting the Mishkon” and it is as if they are two separate topics. But what two topics could there be here? Rather one must say that the verse is to be explained as saying “It came to pass on the day that Moshe finished @ITthe making of the Mishkon@it and the erection of the Mishkon”. Thus Rashi asks “Betzalel and all the wise-hearted men . . .” He answers that “because he utterly dedicated himself . . .” With this one may answer the widely asked question: The verse merely attributes the erection of the Mishkon to Moshe, and he did this alone as is written previously in Parshas Pekudei (Shemos 39:33) Maharai explains that Rashi was answering the question: The Torah should have merely said “It came to pass, on the day Moshe erected the Mishkon. . . . @d1On the second the [red] cow was burned.@bo Rashi wished to answer this so that you would not ask: Didn’t the Levites begin their service immediately after the erection of the Mishkon as is written shortly? How would they be permitted to do this, since they were impure due to contact with a corpse and could not be purified since the red cow has not yet been burned? One cannot say that the cow was burned before the erection of the Mishkon because concerning its sprinkling in Parshas Chukas (Bamidbar 19:4) the Torah writes “opposite the face of the tent” implying that the Mishkon has already been erected when it was slaughtered. He answers “on the second, the cow was burned . . .” thus it emerges that they were purified on the seventh. @d1And on the seventh they were shaven.@bo This is the shaving mentioned in Parshas Beha’alosecha (Bamidbar 8:7) “and they shall pass a razor over their entire bodies . . .” "
Numbers 8:2," Because the flame rises.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How is the term “When you cause to rise” appropriate for lamps such that Scripture writes @hh בהעלותך@ee (when you cause to rise) instead of @hh בהדלקתך@ee (when you light)? He answers that it is because the flame rises, meaning that this was why the terminology of ‘rising’ is appropriate. Rashi also answers another question: Nonetheless the Torah should have written “when you light,” so why does it write “when you cause to rise”? It is certain that the term “when you cause to rise” may also be appropriate regarding lamps, as Rashi explains “because the flame rises,” however the term “when you light” is more correct. He answers that it is written “when you cause to rise” in order to teach that “he is required to ignite . . .” However [one may ask another question:] in Parshas Tetzaveh (Shemos 27:20) regarding the lighting of the continual flame, Rashi only answers why it is written “to cause to rise” rather than “light.” He says that he is required to ignite [the lamp] until the flame rises by itself. The answer is that there it is written @hh להעלות@ee “to cause to rise” in the command form, therefore Rashi explains why the command was given with the term “to cause to rise” rather than the term “to light” which is a clearer command. He answers that because “he is required to ignite . . .” which is a component of the command, therefore it is written “to cause to rise.” See @ITRe’m@it. @eeParshas Emor (Vayikra 24:2) is the real source of this command, as Rashi explains there. The question is why did Rashi did explain anything there? The answer is that he relies upon his explanation in Parshas Tetzaveh about the term “to cause to rise” which was in the command form, as explained. @ITRe’m@it explains similarly that a commentator will sometimes explain all matters that relate to a term, sometimes he will explain some of them and sometimes he will rely upon what he explained elsewhere. Therefore Rashi gave no explanation in Parshas Emor, even though the term “to cause the continual flame to rise” is written there. @d1That there was a platform.@bo Even though we [already] learned from here that he had to ignite until the flame rises by itself, one may explain that the main source for expounding this is from the verse in Parshas Tetzaveh concerning the lighting of the continual flame, and here Rashi mentions it in passing. Another answer is that if it only came to teach that the flame should rise by itself, Scripture should have written “to cause to rise” and not “when you cause to rise.” And if it came only to teach about the platform then it should have written “when you rise up.” Rather the Torah writes “when you cause to rise” to expound both points. @ITRe’m@it explains that the implicit meaning of this teaching (about the platform) and the one that the flame should rise by itself are evenly balanced; therefore [since neither is more implicit than the other] we are able to learn both. @d1Upon which the @BIkohein@BO stood.@bo You might ask: Surely a man is four @ITamos@it high, corresponding to twenty-four tefachim, while the height of the menorah was only eighteen tefachim, as Rashi explains in Parshas Terumah (Shemos 25:35). If so, why does he need a platform? The answer is that the tefachim of the Temple were ‘extended,’ such that the eighteen tefachim of the menorah were equal to twenty-four regular tefachim, i.e. equal to the height of a man. If one comes to clean the lamps he needs to see inside the lamps in order to clean them, therefore he needed a platform. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) Were all the kohanim of equal height? Surely it is possible that a kohein has a slightly shorter stature. Thus there needs to be a platform there so that every kohein can comfortably perform the service of the menorah. @d1Their wicks.@bo Meaning that since it is written “shall the seven lamps cast light,” one is forced to say that it refers to the wicks, since they cast light. For if it refers to the lamps, the cups (containing the oil), it should have said “toward the face of the menorah shall the seven lamps @ITtilt@it.” @eeYou might ask: The verse writes “toward the face of the menorah” meaning that all seven lamps should cast light towards the lamp of the middle branch, but Rashi explains that only six cast light towards the middle lamp. The answer is that Rashi is answering a different question: “Shall the seven lights cast light” implies that all of them cast light before the middle branch, i.e. above it, which is termed the ‘face of the menorah.’ However this is not possible. Granted that the lamp on the middle branch casts light above it, however the six other lamps only illuminate the area above their own branches. Such is the manner of all lamps, which cast light upon themselves. He answers that the six other lamps that were on the six branches also cast light towards the middle branch. Because of the six lamps that were on the six branches, the three eastern ones turned towards the middle . . . meaning that the ends of the wicks were bent towards the middle branch, and the same with the western ones. Thus “the seven lamps cast light” means that in this fashion the seven lamps cast light towards the middle branch. @ITRe’m@it expands upon this. (See @ITResponsa of Rivash@it siman 400). @ee(@ITGur Aryeh@it) raises a difficulty: If this is so, the Torah should have said “the @ITsix@it lamps cast light” because only six cast light toward the menorah. Some explain that the verse is to be understood as follows: “When you light the lamps, towards the face of the menorah” meaning that when you light them the lamps should be towards the menorah — six should face toward the middle. But “the seven lamps shall cast light” is a separate phrase meaning that in this fashion the seven lamps should cast light. "
Numbers 9:1," Was not said until Iyar.@bo As it is stated (Bamidbar 1:1) “in the second month.” @d1That throughout the forty years.@bo Since it is written (v. 5) “on the fourteenth day . . .” why was it necessary to say “in the desert of Sinai”? — At the beginning of the Parshah it writes “in the desert of Sinai”! Rather, it is to teach you that “throughout the forty years . . .” @eeYou might ask: Why did Moshe not compel them to offer the Pesach-offering? The answer is that in the desert there were many Jews who were not circumcised, and who did not circumcise their sons. In which case you might ask: If so, what was the discredit in this — surely they were unable to offer it? The answer is that they brought this about through their sin, because if it has not been for their sin, they would have entered the Land of Israel in another three days, as Rashi explains [below] on the verse “we are traveling . . .” (10:29) (Tosafos Kiddushin 38). "
Numbers 10:2," At the time of departure of @HB המחנות@ee@BO (the camps).@bo Most texts read “departure of @hh המסעות@ee (the formations)” meaning at the time of the departure of the formations, each comprising three camps, each under its banner. Either way, with this Rashi ensures that one not say that when they wanted to travel they would sound the trumpets. For this is not the case; rather the cloud folded first, and afterwards Moshe would say “Arise Hashem.” Only afterwards would they sound the blasts. Therefore, Rashi explains that that at the time of the departure of the camps when they prepared themselves to travel, they would not depart until the trumpets were sounded. "
Numbers 11:1," “The People” refers only to the wicked.@bo You might ask: Do we not [also] find “the people” referring to the righteous, as it says “all of the people together answered and said: All that Hashem says we shall do and we shall hear” (Shemos 19:8). The answer is that when they are wicked the @ITonly@it name that they are given is “the people.” @d1Righteous, they are called “My people.”@bo You might ask: Do we not find “my people” referring to them when they are wicked, as it says “my people do not consider” (Yeshayah 1:3). The answer is that the verse means that @ITbeforehand@it they were my people, but @ITnow@it “they do not consider.” @d1How we have toiled.@bo @hh לבטנו@ee means “we have toiled.” @d1The distinguished among them.@bo You might ask: Rashi explained above that “the people” refers only to the wicked, while here he explains that it refers to the distinguished and the great ones. One cannot say that when he says “the distinguished . . . the great ones” he is referring to the wealthy ones among the wicked, who are thus termed “great,” because further on Rashi asks (v.16) “where were the original elders. . .?” He answers that they died at the fire of Taveirah, implying that those [who died] were the elders who were in Egypt — but these elders were righteous and leaders of the generation. The answer is that when the Torah writes “the people were . . . and the fire of Hashem burned among them” it refers to the wicked, “the people” written above. However, when the fire burned among them, it also burned among those who were not complaining. Thus when it writes “consumed some of the outcasts (lit. edge) of the camp” it refers to the distinguished and the great ones among them. Rashi is referring to these righteous ones when he comments later “in the fire of Taveirah they died.” "
Numbers 12:1," How did [Miriam] know.@bo Meaning: It is not the behavior of modest women to complain to their neighbors about their husbands concerning intimate relations. @d1Just as everyone.@bo For if this were not so, why is the Torah calling her a Cushite? Was she a Cushite? — surely she was a Midianite! Rather, just as a Cushite’s skin is unique, so too her skin was unique in its beauty. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) Because it is somewhat incongruous for the Torah to speak in this cryptic manner, Rashi therefore says that @hh כושית@hh@ee is the numerical equivalent of @hh יפת תואר@hh@ee “beautiful appearance.” @d1Concerning her divorce.@bo Meaning concerning her husband’s separation from her; this is an abbreviated verse. Why did Rashi reverse the order and explain first the words “the Cushite woman”? It appears that one may have thought that they spoke about him because he in fact married a Cushite woman, as the Midrash says; therefore Rashi first explains that @ITthe@it woman with a @IThei@it refers to Tziporah, while the word “Cushite” means that “just as . . .” Afterwards he explains that “concerning the woman” means concerning her divorce. Subsequently he again explains the word “Cushite” — “What does the Torah teach? — You find . . .” And then he explains the word “@ITthe@it Cushite” — meaning the @IThei@it (indicating the definite article) — teaching “because of her beauty . . .” This teaches that she appeared this way to everyone and was known for this, consequently the Torah writes “@hh האשה הכושית@ee ” (lit. the Cushite the woman). Finally Rashi explains “for [he married a Cushite] woman” teaching why the Torah provided a reason. He explains that this means that he should have either not married or he should have remained with her and not have separated from her. @ITR. Yaakov Triosh@it. "
Numbers 13:2," Why [is the chapter of the spies] adjacent.@bo Rashi is questioning why the chapter of the spies is adjacent only to the chapter of Miriam, for it should have been adjacent to the chapters of both Korach @ITand@it of Miriam. The Torah should have placed the dispute of Korach first, followed by the chapter of Miriam and afterwards the chapter dealing with the spies, for the dispute with Korach took place in Chatzeros while the affair with the spies took place [later] in Paran. He answers that it is “because she was punished . . .” and therefore the chapters were not written in the order [that they happened] so that we learn this concept. If the chapters had been written in order, even if the incident with the spies would have been placed before Miriam, one would not have learnt this concept, because perhaps they were merely written in chronological order. @ITRe’m@it. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) I have already written on several occasions that Rashi does not give a reason for juxtapositions except where there is something superfluous, or a linguistic change, etc. which indicates that the Torah is particular about the juxtaposition. Similarly here, when the Torah writes “Moshe sent them from the desert of Paran” this is seemingly superfluous, for it is written above (12:16) “they camped in the desert of Paran” thus it is obvious that they were sent from there. Rather the Torah is certainly informing us of the place from where they were sent to teach us that even though they had traveled from Chatzeros and arrived at the desert of Paran, and they should have accepted reproof, nonetheless they sinned. This is in contrast to the explanation of @ITRe’m@it. @d1According to your opinion.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Surely it is evident to Hashem that they would sin through this dispatch. If so, why did Hashem command them to send the spies, which would cause punishment to come upon them so that they would not enter the Land of Israel, but die in the desert? In response Rashi answers that “I am not commanding you.” @ITRe’m@it explains that Rashi is expounding this from the word “send” and not from the word “for yourself.” Since it is written “all of you approached me and said let us send men before us . . .” (Devarim 1:22), it is certain that Moshe conferred with Hashem and that the reply came that they should be sent. It is evident that this response was granting permission and not giving a command because it was a response to a question, which indicates granting permission rather than giving a command. Concerning the word “@hh לך@ee ” (for yourself) one must either say that this is a manner of speech, as in “the rain has passed @hh הלך לו@ee (and gone)” (Shir Hashirim 2:11). Alternatively, one may expound that when Hashem saw that the spies would sin, He referred to them with Moshe’s name — “send for yourself.” However, when Hashem saw the elders, and that their actions would be correct, he called them after His name, as it states “gather seventy men for @ITMe@it” (Bamidbar 11:16) @ITRe’m@it. @d1Moshe conferred.@bo (@ITGur Aryeh@it) The Ramban asks: According to Rashi’s explanation that Moshe consulted with the Shechinah as to whether to send the spies, he also sinned because Hashem had said that the land was very good. Furthermore, we find written explicitly in Parshas Devarim (1:23) “the matter was favorable in my eyes,” but if so, why was it favorable in his eyes? The apparent explanation is that Yisroel certainly wanted to send the spies, for they wanted to spy out the route and the towns that they would encounter.” It is usual for someone who does not know the way to send out spies — this was a correct and conscientious attitude toward a mitzvah. Similarly, Moshe sent spies to Yazer, and Yehoshua sent two men to Yericho. Consequently Moshe said “it was favorable in my eyes.” However, Hashem who knows the thoughts of man understood their evil intent and said to Moshe “Send them if you wish . . . I have said to them . . .” See there for further detail. @d1An opportunity for error.@bo As [our Rabbis] say “if one comes to defile we allow him.” (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) This does not mean that Yisroel would err in misunderstanding the spies’ words, rather that the spies would err. This refers to their statement “a land which consumes its inhabitants” (v. 32) where the spies erred, as Rashi explains there. "
Numbers 14:2," Would that we had died.@bo Meaning that it is not in the sense of “if” as in “would that I had a sword in my hand” (Bamidbar 22:29) and “would that they were wise” (Devarim 32:29). Rashi uses the word @hh הלואי@ee which has the sense of “would that . . .” It takes a @ITvav@it afterwards similar to “@hh מי יתן @hhו@hhהיה לבבם@ee ” (would that it was in their hearts” (Devarim 5:26), therefore Rashi needed to add in the @ITvav@it — @hh הלואי @hhו@hhמתנו@ee as if it had read “would that we had died.” "
Numbers 15:3," This does not denote a command.@bo Meaning that if this were a command, it would not be correct to say “by verbalizing as a pledge or as a donation” because donations are not commanded. Thus Rashi explains that “when it occurs to you . . .” @d1Satisfying.@bo Not that Hashem receives satisfaction from the offering, for it is written (Tehillim 50:12) “Even if I were hungry I would not tell you . . .” as explained above in Parshas Tetzaveh (Shemos 29:18, 25). The reason for Rashi commenting on “a pleasing fragrance” before “or on your festivals” is that he first explains that “when you make the fire-offering” does not refer to a command, rather when it occurs to you to make a fire-offering to provide a pleasing fragrance. Linked to this he also explained “a pleasing fragrance” before explaining “on you festivals.” @d1In order to fulfill the holiday obligation.@bo Rashi was forced to explain “or that you make . . .” so that one would not understand this as “by verbalizing a pledge, or by verbalizing a donation or by verbalizing [an offering] on your festivals.” For this is not so, given that the offerings on the festivals are obligatory and thus not dependant upon verbalization. "
Numbers 16:1," This passage is beautifully expounded by Midrash Rabbi Tanchuma.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does the Torah use the term “took”? However, given that Rashi says in Parshas Bereishis (3:8) the he comes only to explain the plain meaning of the Torah, not its Midrashic interpretation, he therefore says here that “this chapter is beautifully expounded. . .” Since the Midrashic explanation is close to the plain meaning, Rashi explains it according to the Midrashic interpretation and it is not necessary to explain it according to the plain meaning. @d1Disassociated from the community.@bo Meaning: This taking was in thought — in his heart — and his heart was the subject [of the taking] while Korach was the object. Consequently @hh ויקח@ee (he took) has the same meaning as @hh ויוקח@ee (he was taken) which concurs with the Targum who translates as @hh ואתפלג@ee . @d1Another interpretation “Korach took”: He won over the heads of the Sanhedrin.@bo Because according to the first interpretation there is a difficulty that @hh ויקח@ee (he took) was explained as @hh ויוקח@ee (he was taken). However, according to the other interpretation there is a difficulty since the verse does not specify whom he took as it does concerning Moshe, where it is written “Take Aharon.” Therefore Rashi also gives the first reason. @d1Scripture does not mention “the son of Yaakov.”@bo Rashi wishes to explain why the Torah does not also trace his genealogy to Yaakov. He answers that “Yaakov implored . . .” @d1Where is his name mentioned.@bo Meaning: where is the name of Yaakov mentioned in connection with Korach such that one has to explain why his name is not mentioned here; for surely it is usual for genealogy to be traced back only to the tribe. @ITRe’m@it writes that there is still a difficulty according to the Midrash (Tanchuma 3) which expounds the verse (Bereishis 49:6) “Do not let my soul come into their plot” as referring to the incident of the spies. Similarly there is a difficulty according to Rashi’s explanation in Parshas Vayechi that “Do not let my soul come into their plot” refers to the incident with Zimri ben Salu, leader of paternal house of Shimon (Bamidbar 25:14). There Rashi did not ask where else the name “son of Yaakov” was mentioned concerning Zimri such that one would have to explain why it was not mentioned. @ITRe’m@it leaves the matter as requiring further investigation. See what I wrote in Parshas Vayechi that answers the question of @ITRe’m.@it @d1Neighboring Kehos and his sons.@bo Rashi wishes to answer how Dasan and Aviram came to be with the sons of Kehos to join Korach in disputing the @ITkehunah.@it Surely they were neither Levites nor firstborn, as it is written (Bamidbar 26:9) “Eliav’s sons were Nemueil, Dasan and Aviram.” And if they came to dispute the @ITkehunah@it on behalf of their brother Nemueil, who was a firstborn, it is incongruous that they would have come to do so when Nemueil the subject of the dispute is not mentioned in Scripture as having protested. @d1Woe to the wicked and woe to his neighbor.@bo (@ITMaharshal@it) I have a tradition from my father that this is the explanation: Initially Rashi said “Yaakov implored for compassion. . .” But this raises the difficulty that the genealogy of Dasan and Aviram was traced back to Reuven and the Torah also did not say “son of Yaakov.” Yet we do not find that Yaakov requested that the genealogy of Reuven’s sons not be traced to him regarding the dispute of Korach. Therefore Rashi explains “woe to the wicked. . .” and that consequently they were automatically included in his request. @d1Why did Korach see fit.@bo Meaning: Even though Korach suspected Moshe in all of his actions, that everything he did was on his own accord, nonetheless he should not have disputed the @ITkehunah.@it For surely Aharon was rightfully before him, being he is the firstborn of Amram. @ITRe’m.@it You might ask: Why does Rashi not explain this in its place, and also how is this question related to the preceding explanation? The answer is that before he explained about Dasan and Aviram it was understood that one could not ask “why did he see fit” given that he also wanted to be a kohein. However, now he explained that the involvement Dasan and Aviram was because the tribe of Reuven made their camp according to the arrangement of the banners. Consequently one understands that this dispute occurred in the second year after the exodus from Egypt given that the arrangement of the banners began in the second year, as is explained in Parshas Bamidbar. Therefore, Rashi asks why Korach saw fit to dispute with Moshe over the priesthood in the second year. Why did he not dispute with Moshe in the first year, immediately after the building of the Mishkon? Rashi answers that “he envied Elitzafan for his leadership. . .” for he was also appointed at the time when the banners were arranged. And once Korach had entered into the dispute, he wanted to nullify everything, even those things to which he had no rights. @d1Elitzafan for his leadership.@bo You might ask: Why did Rashi explain above that he came to cast aspersion regarding the @ITkehunah@it? The answer is that if Moshe had given Korach the leadership he certainly would not have disputed the @ITkehunah.@it However once he gave the leadership to Elitzafan, Korach came to dispute everything, even the @ITkehunah.@it Therefore Rashi explains “I will oppose him and nullify everything he said.” You might ask: Why did he also not dispute the monarchy (which was Moshe’s position). The answer is that since the sacrificial service was originally performed by the firstborn, they would join him in nullifying Moshe’s ruling in order that they could become the kohanim. But regarding the monarchy everyone agreed that Moshe should be king, because it was rightfully his, for he took them out of Egypt. Furthermore they could not all be kings, and therefore they would not have joined him in disputing the monarchy. @d1Those called from the congregation.@bo There are those who ask: Why did Rashi bring a proof from there where the Torah writes, “Those called from the congregation”? Surely his source there was only because the Torah writes “@ITleaders@it of [their fathers’] tribes” and here also Scripture writes “@ITleaders@it of the congregation.” The answer is that if not for those words written there, one would have said they were not the heads of the Sanhedrin, since it is written (v. 2), “Those who were called to meetings.” From this, one would understand that they were not called to @ITevery@it matter dealing with sanctity, rather only at certain times. Therefore Rashi brings a proof from there that they were called each time to any matter of sanctity, for the Torah writes “those called from the congregation” meaning for any matter that the congregation required. Rashi adds “and the like” because the people who were designated by name were only the twelve leaders of the tribes, while here there were two hundred and fifty men. Thus he was forced to add “and the like” to say that they were all leaders of Bnei Yisroel, and among them were leaders of the tribes and heads of the Sanhedrin. The @ITgezeirah@it @ITshavah@it (scriptural comparison) teaches that they were of the stature of Elitzur and his companions. And the verse that states that they numbered two hundred and fifty teaches that one should not say that it was specifically the twelve who were designated by name [that were of the stature of Elitzur and his companions], but not the others [rather, they were all of the same stature]. @ITRe’m@it @d1Garments made completely of @BItecheiles.@bo At the end of Parshas Shelach the Torah mentions @ITtzitzis@it and juxtaposes this to “Korach took,” to teach that he took @ITtzitzis.@it You might ask: why does Rashi expound the juxtaposition here? Rashi only does so if the verse is not written in its correct place, as I explained in Parshas Shelach (13:2). The answer is that here too, according to my previous explanation (s.v. ‘Why did Korach see fit’) this section is not its correct place given that the dispute of Korach was over the leadership of Elitzafan. Elitzafan's appointment as leader occurred before the departure from the Mountain of Hashem. If so, why was this section placed here when it belongs in Parshas Bamidbar? In order for us to expound the juxtaposition. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You might ask: What did Korach think? If he held that a garment of @ITtecheiles@it was exempt from @ITtzitzis,@it perhaps Moshe would also answer that it was exempt and there would be no grounds for dispute. And if Korach held that it needed @ITtzitzis,@it then this would only have been because there was reason to obligate it. So perhaps Moshe would also answer with this reasoning and there would be no grounds for dispute. The answer appears to be that Korach’s main focus was not the garment alone. Rather, he thought that Moshe would answer that a garment made completely of @ITtecheiles@it is exempt from tzitzis, and he would counter that the entire congregation are holy and therefore we do not need a Kohein Gadol. See there where he details the comparison of @ITtzitzis@it and the @ITkehunah.@it @d1Dasan and Aviram and On the son of Peles.@bo So that one does not explain “the @ITsons@it of Reuvein” as referring to Peles alone, and that he was [identical with] Palu son of Reuvein. We find this language elsewhere, as in “the @ITsons@it of Dan are Chushim” (Bereishis 46:23) and “the @ITsons@it of Palu are Eliav” (Bamidbar 26:8) where the Torah refers to them in the plural form even though there was only one son. Therefore Rashi explains that the sons of Reuvein were “Dasan and Aviram and On son of Peles,” meaning that Peles was also one of the descendants of Reuvein. We need not ask how one might have thought that Peles was [another name for] Palu when, if so, the Torah should have placed On before Dasan and Aviram, given that they were sons of Eliav son of Palu whereas On was the son of Palu himself! This is not a difficulty because the Torah merely places first those who were more vociferous in the dispute. You might ask: Perhaps he was really the son of Palu, and how does Rashi know that he was not? It appears that Rashi was careful to state “and On son of Peles” because the Torah should have just said “Dasan, Aviram and On.” Why does Scripture write “son of Peles”? This is Rashi’s inference. Furthermore, the Torah writes “On son of Peles” while it should have written “the sons of Eliav, and On, the sons of Peles, son of Reuvein” given that Eliav and On would have been brothers, both sons of Peles, if he had been Palu. Finally, it should not have said “the @ITsons@it of Reuvein” instead of “@ITson@it [of Reuvein]” and “@ITson@it [of Peles]” instead of “@ITsons@it [of Peles].” Rather “sons” must mean “from the family of Reuvein” and therefore Rashi adds “and On the son of Peles.” @ITR. Yaakov Triosh. Re’m@it writes: There are opinions that Rashi means to say that “the sons of Reuvein” refers back to “Dasan and Aviram” alone, and not to On, as if the Torah had said that Dasan and Aviram were from the sons of Reuvein, but that On was a son of Peles and not from the sons of Reuvein. There are also opinions that Rashi’s intention is just the opposite and that it also refers back to On, in order that one not say that “the sons of Reuven” refers to Dasan and Aviram but not to On. This might be so, given that neither On nor Peles are ever mentioned along with the sons of Reuvein. @ITRe’m@it rejects both of these opinions, and I have written what appears most correct to me. "
Numbers 17:2," In the firepans.@bo But not the fire that was on the altar, because if so, what is meant by “for they were sanctified”? How does the fire that was upon the altar affect their sanctification? @d1From the firepans.@bo But not at a distance, because if so Scripture should have explained where [it was to be scattered]. @d1The firepans.@bo But not the fire, because if so, it should not have been thrown to the ground. Rashi afterwards explains why they were sanctified and thus prohibited from being used for personal benefit. It is because those who offered the incense had designated them as sacred service utensils and thus they had to be stored away. "
Numbers 18:1," To say to Aharon.@bo This is one of thirteen exclusions, as Rashi explains at the beginning of Parshas Vayikra (1:1), that [thirteen matters] were said to Moshe @ITand@it Aharon [and corresponding to them there are thirteen ‘exclusions,’ matters told [only] to Moshe for him to tell to Aharon]. @ITRe’m@it rejects this as follows: Perhaps these exclusions only come to exclude Aharon, teaching that Hashem said to Moshe that he should say to Aharon, when Moshe’s name is mentioned along with Aharon’s name. However when Moshe’s name is not mentioned, perhaps it was said to Aharon and not to Moshe. @ITRe’m@it quotes the Sifri. However it is [actually] from the section following (v. 8); see there in detail. It appears to me that Rashi’s proof is because above it is written “Bnei Yisroel said [the following] to Moshe, saying” (17:27). Rashi questions why it was necessary to write “saying.” Rather, it is certain that they said this to Moshe that he should ask Hashem about their difficulty. It is then logical that Moshe would have asked Hashem and that Hashem would have responded back to him. It would not be proper for Moshe to have asked Hashem, and for Hashem to respond to Aharon. Rather it is certain that He told Moshe to say to Aharon. This [explanation] appears to be correct to me, in contrast to the view of @ITRe’m.@it @d1The children of Kehos.@bo [Rashi knows that the verse is referring to the children of Kehos because] afterwards it is written “will bear the sin of the Sanctuary” and Rashi explains that this refers to “the sacred objects. . . the Tent, Ark, Table, and sacred vessels,” and these objects were carried by the sons of Kehos. Therefore Rashi explains that these were the children of Kehos. You might ask that perhaps “The sin of the Sanctuary” refers to the Sanctuary itself and He was warning that non-kohanim should not enter! The answer is that if so, why would Amram’s sons be different from the other Levites such that they are singled out and warned but the other Levites are not. "
Numbers 19:2," Because Satan. @boRashi is answering the question: Why are both the words “statute” and “Torah” written [for surely one of them would suffice]? Rashi is not asking why either term is used altogether, for in many instances it is written in the Torah [only] “statute,” for example, “This is the statute of the Pesach offering” (Shemos 12:43) and “If you follow my statutes” (Vayikra 26:3). Also “Torah” appears in, “This is the Torah for the burnt-offering, the meal offering, the sin-offering” (Ibid., 7:37) and, “This is the Torah for the sin-offering” (Vayikra 6:2). But here it is written, “This is the statute of the Torah” so why are both [terms] necessary? Furthermore, “statute” is juxtaposed to “Torah” implying that one term defines the other. It is as if Scripture said that the Torah of the [red] cow is a statute. And it is not similar to, “My statutes and My Torah” (Bereishis 26:5) for there “statutes” is an independent term, not modifying [the word] “Torah.” Now, even though the entire Torah is the King’s edict [and we cannot know the reasons for the mitzvot], nonetheless here it serves to notify that there is no reason at all [for this commandment], rather it is an [absolute] edict and it is worthy of acceptance by Yisroel without any known reason for it. This is what Rashi explains [when he says], “Because Satan, etc.” You might [challenge this and] note that in the episode dealing with Midyan’s utensils it is [also] written, “This is the statute of the Torah” (Bamidbar 31:21). The answer is that there too it is referring to the ashes of the [red] cow for it is written, “However, it must be purified with sprinkling water” (Ibid. v. 23). According to the Midrash (see Rashi there) that the verse, “However, it must be purified with sprinkling water” refers to immersion, for the Torah requires the immersion of metal utensils to purify them from the forbidden [foods absorbed within], one must say that the [act of] immersion itself is among those [statutes] that have no reason. [For one may wonder] why one thousand @ITseah@it of non-mikvah water cannot accomplish [i.e., purify] what forty @ITseah@it of mikvah water accomplishes. @ITRe”m@it @d1“What is this commandment? What is the reason for it?”@bo You might ask: Why does Rashi seemingly repeat [the same idea] “What is this commandment? What is the reason for it?” Also, why do the nations taunt Israel regarding this commandment more than with other commandments? There are many commandments that seemingly have no reason, such as [the prohibition of] mixing different seeds, or other such similar commandments. And furthermore, why do Satan and the nations of the world taunt Israel particularly regarding this commandment? It seems to me that there are three categories or commandments. First, there are commandments dealing with proper behavior such as prohibitions against theft, murder, and the like, [necessary] for the preservation of the world. Then there is a [second] category of commandments whose purpose is to remove and annul evil spirits and accusations. [These commandments] are the [blasting of the] shofar and [eating] matzos. And being that these commandments have a reason, the nations of the world do not taunt Israel regarding them because the commandments have a reason, in that they serve to remember a miracle. But Satan, which is the evil spirit, seeks to nullify the [reason by saying] ""Why can the commandment only be fulfilled by blowing a shofar [i.e., ram’s horn] or only by eating matza and burning the chometz, etc.?"" And a third category is commandments whose reason is not revealed, yet the nations of the world do not taunt Israel, such as lulav, @ITtzitzis@it, or forbidden food. However, this commandment is not related to any miracle, and it has the [power of] removing of impurity. And also it has similarities to witchcraft in its preparation and burning. Therefore Satan, along with the nations of the world, taunts [Israel] by saying, “What is this commandment which is similar to witchcraft? And also, what reason is there for this Commandment? For it is self-contradictory: The ashes of the [red] cow purify the impure, yet it causes the one who carries the ashes to become impure! And furthermore what reason is there for it to purify the impure?” R. Yaakov Taryesh @d1It will always be called.@bo Rashi is answering why Scripture writes @hh ךילא@ee ? For @hh ךילא@ee (""to you"") implies that Moshe is to be involved with the [red] cow, and below it is written, “Give it to Elozor [the kohein]” (v. 3). However, when it is written, “To take to you pure olive oil” (Vayikra 24:2), and Scripture does not clarify who should be involved with it, one might say that Moshe was to be involved, and therefore it is written, “To take to @ITyou@it pure olive oil.” @d1The cow which Moshe prepared in the wilderness.@bo Because when Moshe prepared this [red] cow in the wilderness, they left over some [ashes] for [future] @ITKohanim Gedolim@it for the Mount of Olives and for other cows that will be sanctified from these ashes, as Rashi explains below (v. 9). That is to say that all [future] cows would need to mix in [ashes] from Moshe’s cow and that is how they became sanctified. Otherwise, it would be disqualified as being ashes of the [red] cow. That is why they are all referred to as Moshe’s. @d1It must be perfectly red.@bo Meaning, why is it written “perfect”? For you cannot say that it means without a blemish for it is specifically stated, “Without a blemish.” @d1Two black hairs, it was disqualified.@bo You might ask: Perhaps even one hair [would disqualify it]? The answer is that had Scripture not written “perfect” but only “red,” I would know that it has to be entirely red, and that even if it had only one black hair it would be disqualified. Now that Scripture writes “perfect” it is to teach that it must be completely red, implying that were it to have even only one black hair it is disqualified. Thus we have a situation of an exclusion following an exclusion, and in such a situation we derive an inclusion, that one black hair does not disqualify, but two back hairs disqualify. However, @ITRe”m@it explains that [the law that] two hairs [disqualify] is a law [given] to Moshe at Sinai. "
Numbers *19:2," Let the cow come and atone . . .@bo You might ask: Surely a prosecutor cannot become a defender, for we similarly apply [this rule] concerning the golden vestments of the Kohein Gadol (Vayikra 16:4). He is forbidden to wear golden vestments when performing the service inside Holy of Holies because of the sin that was committed through gold. Here too surely the sin was done through the calf. The answer is that it was specifically regarding the service inside the Holy of Holies that it is forbidden because [we apply the principle that] a prosecutor cannot become a defender. For we see that [the Kohein Gadol] did serve wearing the golden vestments outside the Holy of Holies. Here too with the red cow, which was offered outside, it would not be fitting to say [the principle] that a prosecutor cannot become a defender. You might ask: Rashi below explains that the service of the red cow was not done by Aharon because [of the principle that] a prosecutor cannot become a defender! The answer is that Aharon is different, because the sin occurred through his [own] hand. However regarding the red cow, it is not @ITthis@it cow that was involved in the sin of the golden calf, only an animal of the same species. You might ask: In Parshas Shemini (Vayikra 9:2) it writes concerning Aharon, “Take a calf for yourself” and Rashi explains, ""To show that Hashem had forgiven him for the incident with the golden calf.” [Surely there we see that] there was no difference between outside or inside the Holy of Holies. The answer is that there it refers to a case where he was atoning for himself, thus it was not appropriate to apply [the principle] that a prosecutor cannot become a defender, even though this was atoning for him regarding the sin of the golden calf. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) You might ask: What is the connection between the red cow, which purifies after becoming impure through contact with a corpse, and atonement for the incident with the golden calf? The answer is that if they had not sinned with the golden calf they would have lived forever, as is stated in the first chapter of [Tractate] Avodah Zarah (5a): Rabbi Yosi says: Yisroel only received the Torah in order that the Angel of Death would not rule over them, as it is written, “So that it will be good for you.” However, when they sinned, Hashem said, “Rather, you shall die like man.” Consequently we see that death itself is an inherent consequence of the golden calf, and thus Hashem said “Let the child’s mother [the cow, mother of the calf] come and wipe away [the filth].” This is why it is used for purification. "
Numbers 20:1," Those who were to die in the desert had already perished.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Since the Torah writes “Bnei Yisroel” it is obvious that it was the “entire community.” He answers that “those who were to die in the desert had already perished,” [i.e., “the entire community” refers to those who were not destined to perish in the desert.] @d1Why [is the portion concerning Miriam’s death] adjacent.@bo Meaning that this portion does not belong here, for they made the golden calf in the first year following the exodus from Egypt and in the second year they burned the red cow. But, Miriam’s death occurred at the end of the forty years after the exodus. @d1Just as sacrifices bring atonement.@bo You might ask: Was the red cow a sacrifice? Surely they did not offer any part of it [on the altar]! The answer is based on Rashi’s alternative interpretation above (19:9), that the Torah calls it a sin-offering in order to say that it is like the holy sacrifices in that it is forbidden for one to personally benefit from it. From there we learn that it is like a sacrifice. @d1So do the death of the righteous . . .@bo You might ask: According to this, shouldn't the Torah have juxtaposed her death to the sacrifices themselves? The answer is that it is juxtaposed to the red cow because they are similar. The deaths of the righteous are not sacrifices, and the red cow is also not a sacrifice per se. Thus we learn one from the other, just as this one brings atonement, so too that one brings atonement. @d1By the Divine kiss.@bo Since it is written here @hh שם@ee [""there""], and concerning Aharon it is also written “Aharon died @hh שם@ee [""there""].” Because if it were not for the @ITgezeirah shavah@it [Scriptural comparison] why does the Torah write “@hh שם@ee ” [""there""] twice regarding Miriam. Perforce it was for the @ITgezeirah shavah@it, to teach that just as there [Aharon died] by the Divine kiss, as it is written, “By the mouth of Hashem,” so too here it was by the Divine kiss. @d1Why then is it not said concerning her, “By the mouth of Hashem.”@bo There are those who ask: What was Rashi’s difficulty? Didn't he explain that we learn a @ITgezeirah shavah@it from Aharon through the word @hh שם@ee [""there""]? The answer is that Rashi is asking: Why is the @ITgezeirah shavah@it necessary? Let the Torah write, “By the mouth of Hashem” explicitly. For we are forced to say that it is not a full @ITgezeirah shavah@it, because if it is, why is it necessary to write “By the mouth of Hashem” regarding Aharon in order to teach that he died by the Divine kiss? We could have learned the @ITgezeirah shavah@it with the word “there” from Moshe. Rather it is certain that this is not a full @ITgezeirah shavah@it and therefore the Torah writes “By the mouth of Hashem” regarding Aharon. Consequently it should have also written “By the mouth of Hashem” for Miriam. Nonetheless, the Gemara (Moed Katan 28a) explicitly states that we learn the @ITgezeirah shavah@it from Moshe. Accordingly one must say that Rashi is saying as follows: “She too died by the Divine kiss” meaning that one learns a @ITgezeirah shavah@it from the word “there” [stated] regarding Moshe. However, regarding Aharon it says, “By the mouth of Hashem,” thus it is not necessary to learn this from Moshe. This was why Rashi says @hh ובאהרן@ee [""However, concerning Aharon""] rather than @hh שבאהרן@ee [""That was [said] about Aharon""]. "
Numbers 21:1," He heard that Aharon died and [the clouds of glory] departed.@bo You might ask: What is Rashi’s source for this? Perhaps [the explanation of the verse] is like its plain understanding, that it was because “Yisroel had come. . .” as the verse continues. The answer is that Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say, “He heard”? It should have merely said “Yisroel came by the route of the spies and the Cannanite King of Arad came and attacked. . .” As the Torah writes (Shemos 17:8) “Amalek came and attacked Yisroel” and (Bamidbar 21:23) “[They] went out against Yisroel to the wilderness; he came to Yohatz and attacked Yisroel.” Similarly it says regarding Og (ibid. v. 33), “He came out against Yisroel, [he with all his people] to wage war at Edre’i.” Rather, it was because they heard that Aharon died and the Clouds of Glory departed. Furthermore one can answer that Rashi’s proof is from Parshas Masei (Bamidbar 33:40) where it is written, “The Canaanites heard. . .after Aharon’s death.” There it is clear that it was only because they had heard that Aharon had died and that the Divine Presence had departed from Yisroel. Rashi explains on that verse, “From here you learn. . .” The words, “From here” imply that he is explaining that his proof is from there, as I will explain there. @ITRe’m@it explains: It is written above @hh וַיִּרְאוּ כל העדה@ee [""The entire community saw. . .""] (20:29) and Rabbi Abahu says (Rosh Hashanah 3a): Read this as @hh וַיֵרְאוּ@ee [""and they feared""] with a @ITtzerei@it under the @ITyud@it in accordance with Reish Lakish who says that here the word @hh כי@ee [translated in 20:29 as ""that"" but sometimes meaning ""because""] comes to explain the matter that precedes it. [Consequently it means that they were fearful] since the community had become vulnerable because of Aharon’s death. It appears that this was why Rashi reversed the order of the verse and explained (20:29) “that [Aharon] had died” after “the entire community of Yisroel” in order to juxtapose it to the comment, “And the Canaanite heard.” @ITR. Yaakov Triosh@it. @d1This was Amalek.@bo Rashi explains this so that you should not pose the difficulty that the verse is contradictory, for it is written, “The Canaanite [king] heard” and afterwards it is written “who lived in the south” which refers to Amalek. [To resolve the difficulty] he explains, “They changed. . .” @d1The great pathfinder.@bo This refers to the Ark, meaning that once they saw that the Clouds of Glory had departed and [the Israelites] only had the Holy Ark traveling before them, they came to attack, something that they had not done previously. @ITRe’m@it. The other interpretation was necessary because according to the first reason there is the difficulty as to why is it written, “The route of the spies.” Did the spies establish that route? Surely it had been established for anyone to pass through. Therefore Rashi brought the other interpretation. Accordingly, Rashi brings the other interpretation and as @ITRe’m@it explains, that it was because only the Ark traveled before them, but the Clouds of Glory had departed that [the Amalekites] came to attack. However, according to the other interpretation there is the difficulty as to why the Torah writes @hh האתרים@ee in the plural form, since it was referring only to the Holy Ark [which is singular]. Therefore Rashi also brings the first interpretation. @d1One maidservant.@bo Rashi had to explain so because the Rabbis state that Yisroel can only be defeated at a time when they act corruptly before Hashem. But here we do not find any corrupt behavior. Therefore he says that the captive who was taken here was merely the captive whom Yisroel captured from them. We need not ask how Rashi knew that there was only one, when perhaps there were two. For one can answer that the term @hh שבי@ee [""captive""] implies that there was only one. You might also ask how Rashi knew that the captive was a maidservant. The answer is that the term @hh שבי@ee implies a maidservant. For in Parshas Bo concerning the warning [before the tenth plague] it is written, “From the firstborn of Pharoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the maidservant. . .” (Shemos 11:5). Whereas later, when the plague struck, it is written “Until the firstborn of the @hh שבי@ee [captive]” (Shemos 12:29). Thus one must explain that @hh שבי@ee there refers to the firstborn of the maidservant and therefore the word @hh שבי@ee written here also refers to a maidservant. For if not so, Scripture should have clarified [whether] he took men, women or children from them. "
Numbers 22:2," He said “Those two kings. . .”@bo Rashi is answering the question: Was he the [only one]@IT@it who saw but others did not see? Rather, he took it to heart and therefore the Torah associates the sighting with him. Alternatively, Rashi is answering a [different] question: The Torah should have stated, “And he heard,” given that presumably he did not partake in the war. Rather, “And he saw” is an expression of comprehension, and what was it that he comprehended? “He said. . .” @d1Certainly we cannot.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How was, “And Moav became terrified” (v. 3) a result of, “And Balak saw. . .”? For the verse implies that it was because of him seeing that Moav became terrified. Rashi answers: “Those two kings. . .” referring to Sichon and Og. He means to say that once the general populace heard that the king had said this, as a result “Moav became terrified.” @ITRe’m@it writes: This is puzzling, because if the word @hh ויגר@ee [""became terrified""] refers to the verse above, what is the meaning of “because of their great numbers” which is written immediately afterwards (v. 3)? For this implies that it was because of their numbers that they were fearful, rather than because of what they did to the two Emorite kings. One cannot answer that there is a @ITvav@it missing from @hh כי רב הוא@ee [""because of their great numbers""] and it as if it had stated @hh וכי רב הוא@ee [""@ITand@it because of their great numbers""], which would mean that it was @ITalso@it because of their great numbers; for if so, Rashi should have explained this phrase like he explained “Because Hashem took Yisroel out of Egypt. . .” (Shemos 18:1). The answer appears to be that the Moavites also knew that Bnei Yisroel were victorious over the two kings, however they thought that the victory had been by natural means. Thus, since their victory in war was only because of their great population, it would be possible to be victorious over them with a greater population, by engaging all the kings of Canaan against them. However, now they had heard from their king that Yisroel’s victory in war was by unnatural means, since they killed the Emorites without standing against them [to cause any casualties]. Consequently, “Moav became terrified of the people because of their great numbers,” meaning that they still had great numbers as before and had not lost a man. This was why they detested their lives. Accordingly Rashi’s explanation is as follows: “These two kings. . .” meaning that 'we were certain that these two kings would kill at least as many Israelites as the Israelites had killed of them, and then we would come with all the Canaanite kings to kill those Israelites who remained. However now that none of them have been killed, because no man raised his hand against them due to the fear of Yisroel that fell over them, all the more so we will not be able to [overcome them], even with [the help of] all the Canaanite kings.' "
Numbers 23:3," He does not usually speak with me by day.@bo As it is written (Bamidbar 22:8), “Spend this night here” and similarly, “Fallen, with opened eyes” (24:4), which according to the simple interpretation means, as Onkelos translates, that Hashem only appeared at night when he slept on his bed. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) For if not so, why did he say “perhaps” which implies a doubt, while above he said “I will know what he adds. . .” which implies that he was certain that Hashem would speak to him? "
Numbers 24:1," I will mention their sins . . .@bo The correct text is as follows: “Whether or not He wants to curse, I will mention. . .” Meaning, whether He wants to curse them or not, I will mention their sins. @d1As Targum Onkelos renders.@bo [Meaning:] He mentioned the sin of the [Golden] Calf they made in the desert. "
Numbers 25:1," This was its name.@bo Meaning: Although there are Midrashic interpretations explaining why it was called @hh שטים@ee [""Shittim""], alluding to the @hh מעשה שטות@ee [""foolish act ""] they performed there, these Midrashic interpretations do not come close to the plain meaning of the verse. Therefore, Rashi explains that this was its name. It appears that Rashi’s inference is that since @hh בַשיטים@ee is written with a @ITpatach@it under the [letter] @ITbeis,@it it implies that it is a well known name. This is not so for the Midrashic interpretations. @ITR. Yaakov Triosh.@it @d1As stated in “Chelek.”@bo Meaning that there it explains the advice that Bil’am gave as to how to seduce them, even though they distance themselves from illicit relationships. As is taught there, that the younger one would sit inside and the older one outside. . . However he does not mean as stated in Chelek that Bil’am gave this advice. For this is evident from the verse, as Rashi explains above (24:14) that [the Torah] writes (31:16): “They were the very same ones who, on Bil’am’s advice were involved with Bnei Yisroel.” "
Numbers 26:1," This is compared to a shepherd . . . Another interpretation: When they left.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How was the count related to the plague? [He answers] by bringing the parable. However, there is a difficulty according to the other interpretation that Rashi brings: How does this answer Rashi’s question? The answer is that previously it is written “Antagonize the Midianites and kill them. . .” while in Parshas Matos (31:2) it is written “Take revenge for Bnei Yisroel against the Midianites, afterward,@ee @eeyou shall be gathered to your people [i.e. die].” From there one sees that the death of Moshe was related to the war with Midian [which was itself related to the plague], and this was why the count of Yisroel was juxtaposed to the war with Midian. The other interpretation is necessary because according to the first reason there is the difficulty that he should have merely counted those who died in the plague, and then he would have automatically known how many were left. Therefore Rashi brings the second interpretation. However, according to this second interpretation there is the difficulty that in the end, the time for Moshe’s death had not yet come, therefore he also brings the first reason. "
Numbers 27:1," To teach you that they were all righteous.@bo That is to say this is another reason why it said “Menashe the son of Yosef.” (@ITKitzur Mizrochi@it) [Rashi states that they were all righteous] even though regarding Tzelofchad it states (v. 3), “But he died because of his own sin” and the Rabbis disagree as to what was the sin. The answer is that he only had this sin and since he died on account of it, his death was his atonement. Thus he was counted among the righteous. You might ask: Surely it is written “Korach son of Yitzhar, son of Kehos”; and Korach was known to have been wicked, yet the righteous were mentioned along with him. The answer is that the Torah would say this only regarding a person who's actions, and the actions of his forefathers were clearly known, like Korach who was known to have been wicked. Thus regarding Yitzhar, Kehos and Levi who were [clearly] righteous, it would have been impossible to change that which was known. "
Numbers 28:2," May Hashem command . . .@bo Rashi is answering the question: What connection does the passage of the constant burnt-offering have with the passage above, where it states “May Hashem, God of the spirits command”? @d1Before you command Me concerning My children, command My children concerning Me.@bo As it is written, “May Hashem command. . .” (27:16). [This means first] command My children concerning Me, that they should serve Me [by teaching them the laws of My altar offerings]. @d1This refers to the blood.@bo As is written (Vayikra 1:5), “The sons of Aharon shall bring the blood” upon it. @d1This refers to the “@BIemurin@BO” parts.@bo Meaning that @hh והקטירם@ee [""shall burn them""] refers to the @ITemurin@it parts that are burned. There (Vayikra 3:16) it is written “bread” [referring to the @ITemurin@it parts]. Thus we see that the @ITemurin@it parts are referred to as “bread.” @d1They learned from here and instituted the @BIma’amados@BO units.@bo Meaning that it is written, “You shall be vigilant.” This implies that for the entire duration of the offering, in the morning and in the afternoon, all of Yisroel should stand over it. However, this is impossible because everyone has to concern himself with his own affairs to support himself. Therefore, they instituted [the @ITma’amados@it] and divided all of Yisroel into twenty-four groups, and similarly the Leviim and the Kohanim were divided into twenty-four groups. One of those twenty-four groups of Kohanim would serve, and similarly they instituted that one group of Leviim and Yisraelim would stand over the constant burnt-offering for one week. During the next week a different @ITma’amad@it [would take their place] and they would be considered as the emissaries of all of Yisroel, for the emissary of a person is considered like the person who sends him. The cycle would continue in this way, such that no one @ITma’amad@it served more than twice a year. @d1Every day . . .@bo For surely it was offered twice daily, thus why was it necessary to say, “At its prescribed time”? Rather, it was so that it would not be withheld, even in a state of impurity. [You might ask:] Why does Rashi not explain here that “at its prescribed time” means even in a state of impurity, as he explains concerning the @ITPesach@it offering (Bamidbar 9:2)? The answer is that there the @ITPesach@it offering came only once a year, thus the term “At its prescribed time” would imply even in a state of impurity. However here the constant burnt-offering was offered twice daily, thus “At its prescribed time” was only appropriate according to Rashi’s explanation. @ITRe’m@it "
Numbers 29:11," And aside from the constant burnt- offering you shall offer.@bo Meaning: [The words] “[And] the constant burnt-offering” are not referring to “the he-goat as a sin-offering,” rather to “You shall bring a burnt-offering” above (v. 8). Thus the verse reads: “One he-goat as a sinoffering aside from the atonement sin-offering, and the atonement burnt-offering aside from the constant burnt-offering and its meal-offering.” Consequently, it is as if it is written “aside from” twice, for the [letter] @ITvav@it of @hh ועולת@ee [""@ITand@it the [constant] burnt-offering""] refers to “aside from” [of] the atonement sin-offering. @d1This relates to the musaf-offerings.@bo You cannot say that it refers to the constant burnt-offering, for if so it should have said @hh ונסכה@ee [""and @ITits@it libation""] in the singular, as it writes @hh ומנחתה@ee [""and @ITits@it meal-offering""]. Furthermore, you cannot say that it refers to “one he-goat as a sin-offering” because sin-offerings do not have libations. Thus, one must say that it refers to the musaf burnt-offerings. Rashi states: “This relates to the musaf-offerings stated above, and to “you shall offer,” even though it is not written, “You shall offer” in this verse. Nonetheless, since Rashi previously commented on, “And the constant burnt-offering” explaining: “Aside from the constant burnt- offering you shall offer these burnt-offerings,” means that it was as if the verse had explicitly written, “You shall offer.” Consequently, “And their libations” refers to them. @d1It denotes a command.@bo Rashi holds that the Torah is now commanding to bring the libations of the musaf burnt-offerings, for it had not yet written about any libations concerning these burnt-offerings. "
Numbers 30:1," Because up until this point we have the words of the Omnipresent.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It is obvious that he said [over] all that Hashem had commanded him! Furthermore, in the entire Torah it mentions the command alone, so why here does it mention the command and also Moshe’s words to Yisroel? He answers that “because. . .” "
Numbers 31:2," But not against the Moavites.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Why were they commanded to take revenge against the Midianites? Surely the Moavites hired Bil’am, as it is written in Parshas Balak (22:5). You might ask: Why does Rashi bring two reasons here, but in Parshas Pinchas (25:18) he brings only one? The answer is that he is answering another question: Why did the Torah here change its language and write “take revenge” while there it is written (25:17), “Antagonize the Midianites”? Rather, one must say that it was in order to make the inference: “Against the Midianites,” but not against the Moavites. Consequently, we see from the inference of “take revenge” that it was specifically killing them that was forbidden, while hating them was permitted. However, above (ibid.) it is implied that even hating them was forbidden, as it is written, “Antagonize the Midianites” [implying that they could not @ITeven@it antagonize the Moavites]. Thus the verses apparently contradict each other. In response, Rashi here brings two reasons: [Firstly] it is forbidden to kill them, “For the Midianites entered the matter out of fear. . .” [And secondly] regarding the implication that it is permitted to hate them, this was after the conversion of the ""two doves,"" because the main reason [for not killing them] was for the sake of ""two doves,"" etc. Therefore once the two doves had emerged it was permitted to hate them, however beforehand it was forbidden. @d1Enraged over a dispute which was not theirs.@bo Meaning: They became enraged to quarrel with Yisroel when they, i.e. Yisroel, had not traveled through their land. Thus, they had no reason to quarrel with Yisroel. @d1For the sake of two doves.@bo @hh פרידות@ee means “doves.” [You might ask: How could he say this] even though only one of them came from Moav. The answer is that Rashi used the language of the Gemara (Bava Kamma 38b). The other interpretation is necessary because according to the first reason there is the difficulty that above it was implied that even Midianites were fearful of Yisroel, as Rashi explained above that, “They made peace between themselves. . .” (22:4), therefore Rashi brings the other interpretation. However, according to the second interpretation there is the difficulty that Hashem could have arranged that Yisroel would not kill the ancestors of the family of Rus, so why did he command them regarding the entire nation, [saying] not to antagonize Moav? Therefore, Rashi also brings the first reason. "
Numbers 32:3," They were part of the land of Sichon and Og.@bo For afterwards it is written (v. 4), “The land that Hashem struck down. . .” meaning [the land of] Sichon and Og whom Yisroel defeated, taking their land, as it is detailed in Parshas Chukas (Ch. 21). Alternatively, because it is written (v. 33), “Moshe gave to them, to the tribe of Gad. . . the empire of Sichon, king of the Emorites and the empire of Og, king of the Bashan” and writing afterwards (v. 34), “The sons of Gad built up Divon and Ataros. . .” mentioning all of the cities that are written here. Thus, we see that they were part of the land of Sichon and Og, not the cities of Midian that were written before. "
Numbers 33:1," You learn that it was in the desert of Paran.@bo Paran was a large plain which included a place called Rismah, thus we see that the decree of the spies was at Rismah. @d1That throughout the thirty-eight years . . .@bo For the decree was only for thirty-eight years, as Rashi explains in Parshas Devarim (1:46). You might ask: From Rismah until Mount Hor there were only nineteen journeys, thus there should have been just forty-@eeone @eejourneys, however Rashi above explained that there were forty-two. See Parshas Chukas (21:4) where Rashi explains that there were seven journeys from Moseirah until Mount Hor (and the comment of Sifsei Chachamim there). @d1Expounds the matter differently.@bo Meaning: This is why the journeys were enumerated. . . @d1Here we slept.@bo Meaning: Here @ITyou@it slept. Likewise, Hashem enumerated all the journeys as if to say that on this journey you did this, and on that journey such-and-such happened to you. @d1We were chilled.@bo In the sense of being chilled, for it is common for those who are sick to be comforted when one cools them. "
Numbers 34:2," The outer reaches of the borders.@bo This following rule should be considered: Wherever Rashi mentions the term @hh מיצר@ee [""outer reaches""] he means “the border” [i.e.] the line that circumscribes the land of Israel. @d1In terms of falling.@bo As in @hh הפיל פור הוא הגורל@ee [""the @ITpur@it was cast, which is the lot""] (Esther 3:7). "
Numbers 35:12," Against the blood redeemer.@bo Meaning that @hh מגואל@ee [""from the avenger""] refers to the blood redeemer. Rashi continues to explain which person is termed the blood redeemer, given the name “redeemer” could refer either to the redeemer of the murderer or to the redeemer of the victim. Therefore Rashi explains that he is a kinsman of the victim. "
Numbers 36:4," R’ Yehudah said.@bo Rashi wishes to answer the question: Why is it written @hh ואם@ee [""and if""], since it should have said @hh וכי יהיה@ee [""and @ITwhen@it [the @ITyoveil@it] occurs""]. For @hh ואם@ee implies that there is doubt as to whether there would be a @ITyoveil.@it When Rashi writes afterwards “so even if @ITyoveil@it occurs” he does not mean to explain @hh ואם@ee as meaning @hh אפילו@ee [""even when""], for if so he would be contradicting what he said above, that the word @hh ואם@ee implies doubt. Rather, the word “even” is part of Rashi’s usage of language, and it is not meant to be an explanation of the word @hh אם@ee . @d1To discontinue.@bo Meaning that the Temple will be destroyed and @ITshmittah@it and @ITyoveil@it will be discontinued. "
