Leviticus 2:1," When a person brings.@p3 “A person” [literally, “a soul”] is not mentioned regarding all the voluntary offerings except the meal-offering. Who is accustomed to bring a meal-offering? A poor person. Said God: I consider him as though he had offered his [own] soul. @d1His offering shall be of fine flour.@p3 Whoever says: @rr°@bbI am obligated [to bring] a meal-offering without specifying [which one] must bring a fine-flour meal-offering, @rr°@bbwhich is the first of the meal-offerings [mentioned], [special in that] its fistful is taken while it is [still] fine flour, as is explained in this section. Since five types of meal-offerings are mentioned here, and all of them are baked before the fistful is taken except for this one, therefore it is called a fine-flour meal-offering. @d1Fine flour.@p3 Fine flour comes only from wheat, as it is said, “fine wheat flour” and no meal-offering [uses] less than a tenth [of an @ITephah@it], as it is said, “a tenth [of an @ITephah@it] fine flour . . . per meal-offering” — a tenth for each meal-offering. @d1He shall pour oil upon it,@p3 on all of it, @d1and place frankincense upon it,@p3 on part of it. He places a fistful of frankincense on it on one side. Why do you say so? For there is no inclusion after inclusion in the Torah @rr°@bbbut to exclude. Another interpretation: Oil [is poured] on all of it, because it [= the oil] is mixed with it and its fistful is taken with it, as it is said, “[he takes from there its fistful] @rr°@bbfrom its flour and from its oil,” and the frankincense [is placed] on part of it, since it is not mixed with it and its fistful is not taken with it, as it is said, @d1with all its frankincense,@p3 for after he takes the fistful he gathers frankincense — all of it — from over it and burns it. @d1He shall pour, and he shall place, he shall bring [to the sons of Aharon],@p3 this teaches that pouring and mixing @rr°@bbare valid when done by a non-@ITkohein@it. "
Leviticus 3:1," Peace-offering. @p3[They are called peace-offerings] because they bring peace into the world. Another interpretation: “Peace-offerings” because they contain peace for the altar, for the @ITkohanim@it and for the owners. "
Leviticus 4:2," Any commandment of Adonoy. @p3Our Rabbis explained: A sin-offering comes only for something whose intentional violation [involves] @rr°@bba negative commandment and [the penalty] of @ITkareis.@it @d1One of these,@p3 part of one of them, such as one who writes on Shabbos, Shem of Shimon, @rr°@bbNoach of Nochor, Don of Doniel. "
Leviticus 5:1," And heard an oath,@p3 in a matter @rr°@bbin which he is a witness, for which they made him take an oath that if he knows some testimony for him [= one of the disputants] he must testify for him. "
Leviticus 6:2," Command Aharon.@p3 @hh צַו@ee , wherever it occurs is @rr°@bban expression of “urging,” [both] immediately @rr°@bband for [future] generations. Said Rabbi Shimon: It is all the more necessary for the Torah to urge [the fulfillment of a command] which involves @rr°@bbmonetary loss. @d1This is the law of the burnt-offering,@p3 this section comes to teach [the rules] regarding the burning of the fats and limbs [on the altar] that it is @rr°@bbvalid all night [long], and to teach regarding [sacrifices which became] invalid, which [of them], if taken up [to the altar], must be taken down [from there], and which [of them], if taken up [to the altar], need not be taken down, for every [mention of the word] @hh תּוֹרָה@ee [= teaching] comes to include [something new], [and in this case,] to say [that there is] one teaching for all that ascend [the altar], and even [those which became] invalid, @rr°@bbif they were taken up [to the altar], they need not be taken down. @d1It is the burnt-offering,@p3 to exclude [a male animal] which was with a woman and [a female animal] which was with a man, and similar cases, whose disqualification [did not occur] in the Holiness [= the Temple], [but] which became invalid before they came to the Temple courts. "
Leviticus 7:1," It is most holy.@p3 It is offered, @rr°@bbbut its exchange is not offered. "
Leviticus 8:2," Take Aharon.@p3 This section was said seven days before the setting up of the Tabernacle, @rr°@bbfor there is no earlier and later [= chronological order] in the Torah.@d1 Take Aharon,@p3 take him @rr°@bbwith [kind] words and draw him [to you]. @d1And the bull [for] the sin-offering, etc.@p3 These are mentioned in the section [which contains] the commands of the installation-sacrifices [in the @ITsidro@it] of Ve’atoh Tetzaveh. Now, on the first day of the installation-sacrifices He repeated [the commands] to urge him on during the [actual] fulfillment [of the command. "
Leviticus 9:1," It was on the @rr°@bbeighth day — @p3of the installation. That [was] Rosh Chodesh Nison, @rr°@bbthat very day on which the Tabernacle was set up, and it [= that day] @rr°@bbtook [the] ten crowns which are taught in Seder Olom. @d1and to the elders of Israel@p3 to announce to them that [it was] by Divine command [that] Aharon @rr°@bbentered [the Tabernacle] and served in the high priesthood, that they not say that he had entered into it on his own authority. "
Leviticus 10:2," A fire came forth.@p3 Rabbi Eliezer says: The sons of Aharon died @rr°@bbonly because they rendered halachic decisions in the presence of their master Moshe. Rabbi Yishmo’el says: @rr°@bbIntoxicated with wine they entered the Sanctuary. You should know [that this is true], for after their death He warned the survivors not to enter the Sanctuary [while] intoxicated with wine. [This] may be compared to a king who had a [faithful] member of his household, etc. as it is [explained] in Vayikro Rabbo. "
Leviticus 11:1," To Moshe and to Aharon.@p3 He told Moshe @rr°@bbto tell Aharon.@d1@p3 @d1Saying to them.@p3 He [= Moshe] said that he [= Aharon] should say to Elozor and to Isomor. Or is it that [he was] to tell Israel? When [the verse] says: “Speak to Bnei Yisroel,” that is the Divine Commandment to Israel; How then do I interpret [the phrase] “to say to them”? To the sons [of Aharon], Elozor and Isomor. "
Leviticus 12:2," When a woman conceives.@p3 R. Simlai said: Just as the creation of mankind [came only] after [that of] every animal, beast and bird @rr°@bbin the Work of Creation, so too his teaching is explained [only] after the teaching [regarding] animals, beasts and birds. @d1When [she] conceives.@p3 [This comes] to include even [when the embryo] is born @rr°@bbmushy — [that is, as though] it was crushed and became @rr°@bbas semen — its mother [is ritually] unclean as if it were childbirth. @d1As the days of her menstrual flow shall she be unclean.@p3 According to the order of all impurity @rr°@bbmentioned in regard to a menstruant woman, so is she made impure by the impurity of childbirth — even if the womb opens without [any visible] blood. @d1Flow,@p3 an expression of something @rr°@bbwhich flows from her body. Another interpretation: An expression of illness and malady, for a woman does not see blood without becoming ill, and her head and limbs [feel] heavy. "
Leviticus 13:2," A spot of intense whiteness or an off-white spot, etc.@p3 These are the names of the skin-eruptions, [each] whiter than the other. @d1A snow-white spot.@p3 Bright spots, @ITtaie@it in Old French, and so [too the word @hh בָּהִיר@ee in the verse] “bright in the heavens.” @d1To Aharon, etc.@p3 It is @rr°@bba Scriptural decree, that [the declaration] of the impurity of skin-eruptions and their purification is only by authority of a @ITkohein@it. "
Leviticus 14:2, This shall be the law etc.@p3 This teaches @rr°@bbthat we do not proclaim him pure at night. 
Leviticus 15:2," Should [discharge] flow.@p3 @rr°@bbPerhaps [a discharge] flowing from anywhere should be impure? The verse says, “from @IThis@it flesh” — and not all his flesh. After the verse distinguished between flesh and flesh, I may argue: @rr°@bb[The Torah] declared a male with a discharge unclean and a female with a discharge unclean; just as a female with a discharge [has a flow] from a place from which she becomes unclean with a less severe impurity — @hh נִדָּה@ee , [from that same place] she becomes unclean with a severe impurity — @hh זִיבָה@ee — so [too] regarding a male with a discharge: from the place from which he becomes unclean @rr°@bbwith a less severe impurity — @hh קֶרִי@ee , he becomes unclean with a severe impurity — @hh זִיבָה@ee . @d1His discharge, he is impure.@p3 [This] teaches in regard to @rr°@bba drop [of discharge] that it causes impurity. [This] discharge resembles water of dough made of barley, @rr°@bband dissolved, and similar @rr°@bbto the white of an egg which is crushed; semen is thick, like the white of an egg that is not crushed. "
Leviticus 16:1," And Adonoy spoke to Moshe after the death of two sons of Aharon, etc.@p3 What does the verse say? Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah made a parable: [This may be compared] to a sick patient whom a physician visited. He said to him: “Do not eat cold food and do not lie @rr°@bbin a damp place.” A second [physician] came and said to him: “Do not eat cold food and do not lie in a damp place, [in order] that you not die in the [same] way so-and-so died. This [second one clearly] urged him on more than the first one. Therefore it is said, “after the death of two sons of Aharon.” "
Leviticus 17:3," Who will slaughter an ox [or] lamb.@p3 @rr°@bbThis verse speaks of consecrated [animals], as it is said, “so that it may be brought as an offering.” @d1Within the encampment,@p3 @rr°@bboutside the [Temple] courts. "
Leviticus 18:2," @p3@d1I am Adonoy, your God,@p3 I am He who said at Sinai: “I am Adonoy your God,” and you accepted My kingship upon on yourselves; therefore, accept My decrees [which follow]. Rabbi [Judah the Prince] says: It was revealed and known before Him that they will eventually tear [themselves] loose [from the laws] of forbidden relations in the days of Ezra; therefore, He came to them with a decree: @d1I am Adonoy your God —@p3 know Who decrees [this] on you, @rr°@bba Judge who will exact punishment and [Who] is faithful in giving reward. "
Leviticus 19:2," Speak to the entire congregation [of] Bnei Yisroel.@p3 [This] teaches that this @ITparashoh@it was said @rr°@bbduring an assembly, since most essentials of the Torah are dependent on it. @d1You shall be holy.@p3 Separate yourselves @rr°@bbfrom sexual crimes, and from transgression, for wherever you find a fence against sexual crime, you find holiness [mentioned]: “A harlot or a profaned woman [they shall not marry]. . . for I, Adonoy, am Holy, [the One] Who makes you holy,” “He shall not profane his offspring [among his people], for I am Adonoy, [the One] Who makes him holy,” “They shall be holy . . . a harlot or a profaned woman [they shall not marry].” "
Leviticus 20:2," And to Bnei Yisroel you shall say:@p3 @rr°@bbthe punishments for the prohibitions [already given]. @d1He shall surely be put to death —@p3 by a court. And if the court does not have the power, @rr°@bbthe people of the land shall assist them. @d1The people of the land,@p3 the people @rr°@bbfor whose sake the land was created, the people who are destined to take possession of the land through these @ITmitzvohs.@it "
Leviticus 21:1," Speak to the @BIkohanim.@p3 @rr°@bbSay, and you shall say —@p3 to warn the adults regarding the minors. @d1The sons of Aharon.@p3 Perhaps those unfit [are also included in this prohibition]? @rr°@bbThe verse says: @d1The @BIkohanim@BO. The sons of Aharon —@p3 even those who have a [physical] blemish are implied. @d1The sons of Aharon,@p3 and not the daughters of Aharon. @d1Let him not defile himself among his people,@p3 while the dead body is still @rr°@bb“among his people,” @rr°@bbexcluding a @ITmes mitzvoh@it. "
Leviticus 22:2," And let them keep away,@p3 [The word] @hh נְזִירָה@ee refers to “separation,” and so too [the verse] says: “And he separates himself from following Me,” “They are gone away backward,” [thus implying here:] they shall separate [themselves] from holy things in the days of their impurity. And let them keep away from the holy offerings of Bnei Yisroel, which they sanctify for Me, and not profane My Holy Name. @rr°@bbReverse the verse and expound it. @d1Which they sanctify for Me,@p3 [this redundancy comes] to include the holy offerings of the @ITkohanim@it themselves. "
Leviticus 23:2," Speak to Bnei Yisroel, [and say to them], the appointed times.@p3 Regulate the appointed times so that [the] Israel[ites] should become practiced in them. [We learn from this] @rr°@bbthat [the Sanhedrin] proclaims a leap year for those living in the Exile who have left their homes to ascend [to Jerusalem] for the festival, [but] have not yet reached Jerusalem. "
Leviticus 24:2," Command Bnei Yisroel.@p3 This is the section concerning the @ITmitzvoh@it of the [Tabernacle] lamps. And the section in the @ITporoshoh@it of Ve-Atoh Tetzavveh, was mentioned [there] only for the sake of the Order of the Work of the Tabernacle, to explain the purpose of the @ITmenorah@it, and so it implies: You will in the end command Bnei Yisroel regarding this. @d1Pure, pressed olive oil.@p3 Three oils come forth from the olive: [the oil of] the first [pressing] is called “pure” — and [these three oils] are explained in [Maseches] Menochos, and @ITToras Kohanim@it. @d1Continually,@p3 from night to night, like [the expression] “a continual burnt-offering,” which [comes] only from day to day. "
Leviticus 25:1," On Mount Sinai.@p3 What has the matter of the Sabbatical year [to do] with Mount Sinai? Were not all the @ITmitzvos@it said at Sinai? Rather, [this come to teach that] just as @ITshemittoh@it its general rules, details, and specifications were said at Sinai, so [too] all of them (the @ITmitzvos@it) [including] their general rules and specifications. were said at Sinai, So is it taught in @ITToras Kohanim@it. And it seems to me that such is its explanation: Since we do not find that land @ITshemittoh@it was repeated at the Plains of Moab in @ITSefer Devorim@it, we have learned that its general rules and its details — all of them — were said at Sinai. And the verse comes [to] teach [us] here that every utterance which was prophetically said to Moshe, that all of them were from Sinai — their general rules and their specifications — and they were repeated at the Plains of Moab. "
Leviticus 26:1," You shall not make idols for yourselves.@p3 [This is] directed against one who is sold to a non-Jew, that he not say “since my master commits sexual crimes, I will do like him [will do the same], since my master worships idols, I will do like him, since my master profanes the Shabbos, I will do like him;” therefore these verses are stated. And these @hh פָּרָשִׁיּוֹת@ee are also said in order: At first he warned [him] regarding the seventh year, and if he coveted money and was suspected of [trading in] the seventh year, his end will be to sell his moveable property. And that is why [verse 14] was placed adjacent: “When you sell to your neighbor” — (what is written regarding this? “Or purchase from your neighbor” — something which is acquired from hand to hand) — if he does not repent, his end will be to sell his estate. [If] he [still] does not repent, in the end he sells his house; [if] he does not repent [at this point], in the end he will borrow at interest — all these last are worse than the first. [If] he has still not repented, in the end he sells himself; [if] he does not repent, not only will he sell himself to a Jew, but even to a non-Jew. @d1And a prostration stone,@p3 [an expression denoting] covering, as [in the verse] “I will cover [you] with My hand.” [This means] they cover the ground with a stone floor. @d1Upon which to prostrate oneself,@p3 even to Heaven, because [prostration involves] the spreading out of hands and feet, and the Torah forbade doing so outside the Temple. "
Leviticus 27:2," When a person expresses — @p3he specifies orally. @d1Pledging valuation of souls,@p3 to give the worth of souls, [that is,] to say: “The worth of something on which the soul depends is incumbent upon me.” "
