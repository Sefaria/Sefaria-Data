Deuteronomy 2:1," Had they not sinned, etc.@bo Meaning: Due to their sin, Hashem did not manipulate the King of Edom’s heart to allow them to pass through his land. @d1The route they traveled when leaving Egypt, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: “By way of the Reed Sea,” implies that they traveled from north to south, along the Reed Sea. Yet, they traveled from west to east in the wilderness! For this reason, Rashi explains: “The route they traveled when leaving Egypt,” i.e., when they left Egypt, they traveled diagonally towards the Reed Sea from west to east. Now, also, they traveled in the same direction, for they abandoned traveling the shorter route from south to north. Instead they traveled along the southern border of Edom, from west to east, until they came to the border of Moav. @d1[We traversed] its entire southern rim.@bo One should not say that they circled Mount Seir on all four sides, and this is not possible. For otherwise Moshe would have entered the Land of Israel, because the land of Edom is on the border of the Land of Israel, as explained in the demarcation of the Land’s borders (Bamidbar 34:3). Therefore, Rashi explains: Only its entire southern rim, until the land of Moav (@ITMaharan@it). "
Deuteronomy 3:4," I learned from this that, etc.@bo I.e., from @ITTargum Yerushalmi@it I learned that a palace is called @hh טרכונין@it , and then we can learn from this that @hh ארגוב@it also means a palace. The term @hh הפרכיא@it , in other words, means the Royal Palace. @d1In other words the empire is called after its name.@d2 I.e., an important city. "
Deuteronomy 4:6," This refers to the study of the Mishnah.@bo “Preserve,” is to study, and “fulfill” is to uphold the mitzvos. For whoever does not learn, does not fulfill. @d1Through this you will be considered wise, etc.@bo Rashi changes the nouns, “wisdom and understanding,” into adjectives. This is because wisdom and understanding are not valued by the nations in their own right, and therefore it would not be logical for the verse to say, “In the eyes of the nations.” Rashi therefore adds the word @hh תחשבו@it (you will be considered), meaning that, “your status will be considered as wise and understanding in their eyes.” "
Deuteronomy 5:3," [Not with our forefathers] alone did Adonoy make this, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse implies that Hashem gave the Ten Commandments exclusively to us, and not to our fathers who already died. But, many were alive when the Torah was given, in the year after leaving Egypt. This covenant was also made with them, though now they are not alive. Therefore, Rashi explains: Not with our forefathers @ITalone@it did Adonoy make this covenant, etc., but also with us. "
Deuteronomy 6:4," Adonoy Who is presently our God, etc.@bo Otherwise it should say, “Listen, Yisroel! Adonoy is one.” Rather, the verse means: Listen, Yisroel! Now He is only [recognized as] our God, but the time will come, etc. In other words, all the idolaters will acknowledge that He is One in heaven and on earth, and in all four directions. And this is the Oneness that our sages derive from this verse, as Scripture says (Zechariah 14:9), “On that day Adonoy will be King. . .Adonoy will be One, etc.” "
Deuteronomy 7:2," Do not hold them in esteem, etc.@bo This interpretation is problematic, for it should say @hh תחנן@it with the letter @ITnun@it, which is the term for esteem. Alternatively, it should say @hh תחונם@it , spelled with a @ITvov@it. Therefore Rashi says, “Another interpretation: Do not give them an encampment.” In other words: Even if you do not make a treaty, but think to [let them live with you and] tax them. Therefore it says not to give them any settlement at all in the Land. The second explanation is problematic, for then the verse should only state not to give them any settlement in the Land (@hh לא תחנם@it ), and all the more so [we would know that] it is forbidden to make a treaty with them. Therefore the first explanation is also needed. "
Deuteronomy 8:1," This can be understood in its plain sense.@bo I.e., the word @hh מצוה@it (lit., commandment) refers to a [whole] category, as if it said, “all the commandments.” @d1There is also a Midrashic explanation: If you began to fulfill a @BImitzvah@BO, complete it, etc.@bo I.e., the word @hh כל@it is related to the word, “And Hashem @ITcompleted@it (@hh ויכל@it ) on the seventh day, etc. (Bereishis 2:2).” Alternatively, the word @hh כל@it is related to the word @hh כלה@it (entire). In other words, you should perform the @ITmitzvah@it in its entirety — if you begin to fulfill it, complete it. According to this, the word @hh מצוה@it written in this verse refers to “a single commandment.” "
Deuteronomy 9:1," You are powerful, etc.@bo Otherwise why does it say, “than you”? It would suffice to say, “to come inherit nations great and powerful.” "
Deuteronomy 10:1," And Betzalel made the Tabernacle first, etc.@bo I.e., do not say that they certainly were not commanded to make the Tabernacle until after Yom Kippur, but Betzalel made the ark first and afterward the Tabernacle. And if so, this ark (mentioned here) could be the ark that Betzalel made. Therefore, Rashi explains, “And Betzalel made the Tabernacle first, etc.” "
Deuteronomy 11:2," Pay close attention so that you know and understand, etc.@bo [“You will know today,”] does not mean that they will know something new today. For he told them nothing new here. @d1That I now speak, etc.@bo For the word @hh את@it [here] means the same as @hh עם@it (with). Rashi adds, “That I now speak,” for without adding “That I now speak” the [meaning of the] verse cannot be understood. Therefore he needed to explain the word @hh את@it means “with,” for the word @hh עם@it applies only to one who is being spoken to. Also Rashi adds the word “now,” for without it the verse means that He would never speak with any of their offspring, only with these alone. "
Deuteronomy 12:2," Destroy, then destroy afterward, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hh אבד תאבדון@it , which is repetitive? Even though the Torah uses common speech, it should have said @hh אבד תאבדו@it . Yet it is written @hh תאבדון@it [i.e., an extra letter @ITnun@it] in order to be expounded. This is not in accordance with @ITRe”m@it’s explanation. @d1What must you obliterate from them?, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written, “You must obliterate all @ITthe places@it where the nations worshipped”? But whatever is connected to the earth [and certainly the earth itself] cannot become an idol (Avoda Zara 45a). Rather, “All the places,” means, “From the places. And what must you obliterate from them? Their gods, etc.” I.e., the words “their gods” are connected to, “You must obliterate,” and not to, “where the nations worshipped.” It is as if the verse says, “You must obliterate their gods on the mountains where the nations worshipped.” This is what Rashi means by saying, “What must you obliterate from them?” [“@ITAll@it the places,” taken literally, would include places that are impossible to destroy. But now that “all” is interpreted as “from,”] and it excludes any place that is impossible to destroy, such as worship of the celestial bodies. "
Deuteronomy 13:1," Five @BItotafos@BO within the @BItefilin,@BO etc.@bo See my explanation above in Parshas Va’eschanan (4:2). Rashi’s statement, “five species with the @ITlulav@it,” refers to where he @ITbinds@it them so that the five species are all bound together — For [only] then does he transgress. But if he did not bind them together, he does not transgress. Even according to the viewpoint that a @ITlulav@it does not need binding, it is nevertheless understood that if he binds them together he transgresses the prohibition of, “Do not add.” "
Deuteronomy 14:1," Do not inflict lacerations and gashes on your flesh, etc.@bo I.e., a prohibition only applies to a person carrying out an action, and not on the one to whom the action is carried out. Since the [@IThitpa’el @itverb form of] the term @hh לא תתגודדו@it (do not lacerate yourself) usually emphasizes on whom the action is carried out, therefore Rashi explains, “Do not inflict lacerations on your flesh.” And Rashi says @hh גדידה ושרט@it (lacerations @ITand gashes@it) to let us know that @hh גדידה@it is a type of gash — the two words are synonymous. See Parshas Emor (Vayikra 21:5), where this verse has been fully explained. "
Deuteronomy 15:2," Of every creditor.@bo The verse is disarranged, for the @ITshmitah@it only applies to the hand of the creditor [and not to his entire self] — that he shall not have a hand [i.e., the ability] to claim his debt. Rashi adds the word @hh של@it (of) because it says @hh ידו@it [spelled] with a @ITvav@it (@IThis@it hand), then we need to explain whose hand it is. Therefore Rashi continues and says, “. . . of every creditor.” Rashi also adds the word @hh את@it , to indicate that “his hand” is the object. For without the word @hh את@it then “his hand” is the subject, as in “And his hand reaches (Vayikra 25:26).” "
Deuteronomy 16:2," You shall slaughter, as the @BIchagigah@BO- offering, etc.@bo For the @ITpesach@it-offering may only be from the sheep or from the goats. "
Deuteronomy 17:1," This prohibits causing the @BIpigul@BO disqualification of the sacred offerings through a pernicious statement, etc.@bo Because you cannot say that [this part of the verse] is coming to prohibit [an offering that has] a blemish, since it is explicitly written, “that has a blemish.” He resolves [this problem by saying], “This prohibits, etc. through a pernicious statement.” I.e. above in @ITsefer@it Vayikra (7:18) and in @ITparshas@it Kedoshim (Vayikra 19:8), it is written that one is forbidden to eat @ITpigul,@it but it does not specify whether the person who made it @ITpigul@it had committed a transgression. Therefore it says here, “Do not sacrifice, etc. any bad thing,” to teach you that it is] prohibited to make offerings @ITpigul,@it i.e. if a person has in mind at the time of slaughtering to eat it beyond its [prescribed] time or outside its [prescribed] place which is accomplished by a pernicious statement. "
Deuteronomy 18:1," Whether physically sound or blemished.@bo Otherwise, why does the Torah write “the @ITentire@it tribe of Levi” after it had written “the @ITkohanim,@it the Levites” beforehand? Therefore this must be to include “whether physically sound, etc.” You might ask: Why does one need to exclude the blemished [from inheritance]? Above in @ITparshas@it Tzav (Vayikra 6:11) it is written, “Every male descendant of Aharon may eat it,” and Rashi explains, “‘Every male,’ and even the blemished, etc.” i.e., they too receive portion in the sacrifices. And [if so], it is obvious that they are excluded from inheritance because they are given a portion in the offerings for this [very] reason. The answer is that the owners of extra-Sanctuary items such as @ITterumah@it and @ITbikkurim,@it the firstborn, @ITchallah,@it and the forelimb, etc. have @ITtovas hano’ah@it in their offerings, i.e. they can give them to any @ITkohein@it they choose, and they usually give these items to physically sound @ITkohanim@it who can perform the sacrificial service and not to blemished @ITkohanim@it who are not able to perform the sacrificial service. Therefore one might have thought that they take a portion in the land, and because of this one needs a [Scriptural] exclusion. @d1This refers to the extra-Sanctuary sacred items, etc.@bo I.e. sanctified items brought from the outside. And what are they? Rashi explains, “The @ITterumah@it-gifts and the tithes.” "
Deuteronomy 19:3," At every fork in the road.@bo So that he does not err at the fork in the road. @d1The distance from the border, etc.@bo You might ask that based to this division, the land would be divided into four sections! The answer is that the distance from the border until the second town of refuge is the same distance as from the first town until the last [town]. And from the second town until the second border is also the same as these distances. Therefore it is called “three sections.” I gave the same explanation in @ITparshas@it Terumah (Shmos 26:26) regarding the bars. It also explains in @ITPerek Eilu Hein Hagolin@it (Makkos 9b) [like Rashi here], that “divide into three sections” means that the land is divided into four sections along its breadth. See there. "
Deuteronomy 20:1," Scripture positioned going to war, . . . to teach, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Scripture should have juxtapositioned over here the judiciary laws of @ITparshas@it Ki Seitzei (below 21:22), “If a man is guilty of a capital offense, etc.,” and the other capital offenses mentioned there. He answers, “To teach, etc.” @d1Another interpretation. To teach that if you judge righteously, etc.@bo According to the first interpretation you might ask that “eye for eye” mentioned here is referring to money and not the lacking of a body part. Therefore Rashi explains, “Another interpretation, etc.” And according to the other interpretation on its own you might ask that it should have juxtapositioned this to the beginning of the @ITparsha@it where it is written (above 16:18), “And they shall judge the people righteous justice, etc.” @d1Consider them enemies.@bo Otherwise, why does Scripture write “against your enemy”? Obviously, if they go out to war they are not going out against friends! @d1Do not pity them, etc.@bo One may ask: This is already explicitly written below (v. 13) “And you shall smite all its males by the sword”! Furthermore, why is it written afterwards (v. 14) “However, the women and the children, etc.” yet here Scripture implies that they should not pity them at all! The answer is: Below Scripture is dealing with a war that does not involve direct combat, rather [it is dealing] with the conquest of a city. The proof is that it is written [there] (v. 13) “Adonoy, your God, will deliver @ITit@it into your hand, and therefore it written “However, the women and the children etc.” But here we are dealing with a war that involves direct combat, so you are not to pity them at all. @d1It says, “When Pharaoh’s horse approached.”@bo Why does Rashi not cite the verse (Shmos 14:23) “@hh כל סוס פרעה@it (lit. every horse of Pharaoh’s)” which precedes it? The answer is that he does not cite this previous verse because it is written,@hh כל סוס@it , “@ITevery@it horse,” and @hh כל@it comes to cite something additional, so that it is as if it had written “each and every horse of Pharaoh.” Therefore he cites the verse “when Pharaoh’s horse approached” which cannot be explained in this manner. It seems to me that this [verse cited by Rashi] is a textual error; Sifrei cites the verse (ibid. 15:1), @hh סוס ורוכבו רמה בים""@it (horse and its rider He threw into the sea).” (Nachalas Yaakov) @d1In your eyes they are numerous, etc.@bo Rashi is answering [the question]: It is written “horse and chariot” which implies that in the eyes of the Holy One Blessed Is He they are all like one horse, yet afterwards Scripture writes “@hh עם רב@it (people more numerous than you)”! And he answers, “In your eyes, etc.” "
Deuteronomy 21:2," The most distinguished of your elders, etc.@bo Because it should have said “the elders of the city” similar to “the elders of that city are to take.” Yet it is written “your @ITelders@it,” implying “the most distinguished of your elders,” i.e. the Sanhedrin; see there in Maseches Sanhedrin (14b). @d1From the spot where the corpse is lying.@bo Even though the verse tells us only the end of the measurement and not the beginning, it is logical that the measurement begins with the corpse. @d1In every direction, in order to determine which is closest.@bo Not that there is an obligation to measure from the corpse to every city; rather, the measurement is to determine which city is nearest the corpse. Therefore if the corpse was near a city and it is certain that there is no other city closer, there is no need for measuring. "
Deuteronomy 22:1," Avert your eyes as if you do not notice it.@bo Because you cannot say [it means] that the person conceals from telling that he found them, because if so, if should have said “and conceal @ITthem@it,” which would imply that he is concealing [the fact] that he has them. But because it is written “and conceal yourself from them,” it implies that he conceals his eye from seeing it. @d1You may not observe it, etc.@bo Rashi is answering [a difficulty]: The verse seems to be saying, “Do not see, rather conceal, etc.,” which implies that one is permitted to conceal himself [and this is not so]. @d1The Rabbis, however, comment: At times, you may conceal yourself, etc.@bo In which case? If he is a @ITkohein@it and there is a [lost] ox in a cemetery; or if he is an elder and it is not fitting for his honor. "
Deuteronomy 23:1," He cannot effect marriage with her, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: It should have said “he may not expose” as it is written in the end [of the verse], “And may not expose.” He explains that @hh קיחה@it implies that he cannot effect marriage with her, i.e. [he cannot] marry her with money, because we derive this law by comparing the expression @hh קיחה@it written here to @hh קיחה@it written regarding the field of Efron (Kiddushin 2a) [where it denotes marrying with money]. Rashi is referring to [marrying] her after the death of his father, otherwise, we would know [that he cannot marry her] because she is a married woman. @d1His father’s prospective levirate partner, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Why does the verse needs to add, “And may not expose the edge of his father’s garment,” [which seems superfluous]? Therefore he says that it comes to include his father’s prospective levirate partner, etc. @d1Evidently, to transgress, with her, against two prohibitions, etc.@bo You might ask: There are three prohibitions, because there is also the prohibition, “Let the wife of the dead man not marry outside to a strange man” (below 25:5)! The answer is that these two prohibitions apply even after his father’s death, but the prohibition of “Let the wife of the dead man not marry outside to a strange man” applies only as long as he is alive. @d1To teach that the bastard is only, etc.@bo Rashi means that this is another reason why the Torah writes, “And he may not expose the edge of his father’s garment,” in order to juxtapose to it, “the bastard may not enter, etc.” You might ask that the verse, “One may not enter — with injured or crushed genitals, etc.,” interrupts between these two verses! The answer is since such people cannot have children and so they are unable to produce bastards, the verse [concerning them] is not considered an interruption. @d1As no act of incest or adultery subject to judicial execution, etc.@bo Rashi is saying that you should not ask: There is a rule that we cannot add extra punishments [or extra prohibitions to a transgression] through a @ITkal vachomer@it [and similarly we cannot add the status of a bastard to a child resulting from this transgression through a @ITkal vachomer@it]! He explains that “no act of incest, etc.” Therefore, since this transgression is liable to @ITkares@it, the child will be a bastard even without a @ITkal vachomer @itsince he is the result of a @ITkares@it prohibition. And the father’s prospective levirate partner is a @ITkares @itprohibition because she is his aunt. "
Deuteronomy 24:1," He is then commanded to divorce her, etc.@bo Since the verse explains that “she did not find favor in his eyes because he found in her something lecherous.” This indicates that “he is then commanded, etc.” And [also], because it states the term @hh והיה@it which is an expression of certainty, i.e., a command. (Minchas Yehudah). [An alternative explanation]. Because it should have stated, “If he found in her something lecherous, he shall send her from his home.” Why is it written, “Should she not find favor in his eyes, etc.”? This indicates that the verse is teaching that you should not tell him that he can send her away even after a while, because in the meantime she might find favor in his eyes and he will not send her away. Therefore the Torah commands him to send her away [immediately]. [The text is reconstructed as follows: “Should he find in her something lecherous, she must not find favor in his eyes”]. I know what @ITRe”m@it had written and I do not want to be lengthy (Nachalas Yaakov). "
Deuteronomy 25:1," They will ultimately approach the court of justice, etc.@bo Meaning: It should have [simply] said, “And the two people who have the judgment come.” This indicates that the verse is saying that if men have a quarrel, they will ultimately bring it to court and be unable to reach a compromise except through judgment. @d1“Should the wicked one deserve flogging” (@HB בן הכות@BO ), etc.@bo Like its Targum [@hh בר חיבא לאלקאה@it , that @hh בן@it means “son”]. Some explain that it is an expression of @hh בינה@it , understanding, because the person must have discernment. This excludes a deaf person, an insane person, or a minor. Some explain that it refers to the judge. I.e., if the judge understands that the person transgressed and deserves flogging (I found this interpretation). @d1A negative commandment unattached to a positive commandment.@bo But if it is attached to a positive commandment, one is not flogged. The same applies to a negative commandment that involves no physical action, or that is subject to warning of death by court, or that is subject to financial restitution, or a general negative commandment that includes many things, as stated in @ITmaseches @itMakos (13a). "
Deuteronomy 26:1," This teaches that they were not obligated to bring the first fruits, etc.@bo You might ask why did Rashi not explain this earlier in@IT parshas@it Shoftim (17:14) in the section [dealing with the appointing] a king, for there too it is written, “and inherit it and live in it”? The answer is that Rashi wants to explain why here it says, “And you inherit it and settle it.” For the [the law derived from these words] could be derived from the section dealing with [appointing] a king since we derive [from the term] “come” “come” from each other. Just as there they are not obligated [to appoint a king] until after the conquering and apportioning [the Land], so too here. And there is a tradition that this @ITgezeira shava@it is a halacha given to Moshe at Sinai as Rashi explains in @ITparshas@it Shelach Lecha (Bamidbar 15:18) regarding @ITchallah.@it [He comments there on the verse], “At your coming to the land,” that, “This [term] 'coming' is different from all the 'comings' in the Torah, etc. because Scripture specified with one of them, etc.” I.e., since it specified regarding [the obligation of appointing] a king, that it does not apply until after inheritance and settling [the Land], so too with all of them. Thus we see that this is an absolute @ITgezeira shava.@it And if so, why does the verse here need to write “and you inherit it and settle it”? Rashi answers, “This teaches that they were not obligated to bring the first fruits, etc.” Apparently this verse is talking about eating [fruits], so one might have thought there is an obligation to bring first fruits immediately [after arriving in the Land] before benefiting from them, as we say (Berachos 35a), “Whoever benefits from this world without a blessing is considered as if he committed sacrilege,” and we would not have applied the @ITgezeira shava@it from [appointing] a king. Therefore Rashi has to explain explicitly, “'And you inherit it and settle it,' [This teaches, etc.”] However, above in @ITparshas@it Shoftim [the verse also has to specify that it is only after settlement, as] we would not learn this from first fruits, because one might think that they are obligated to appoint a king immediately they enter the Land, because the king is appointed to lead them in war, and there is no greater need for this than during the conquest and apportionment, since that is the main time of war. Therefore the verse there has to explain [by saying], “And inherit it and settle in it,” that this [appointing] is only after conquest and apportionment, in order that they give credit for the conquest to the Holy One and not to a mortal king. "
Deuteronomy 27:1," This denotes constancy, etc.@bo Meaning, you should always keep this commandment. It is not an expression that denotes a command because if so, it would have been punctuated with a @ITsheva @itunderneath the @hh שי""ן@it . You also cannot say that it is an infinitive because then it should have said @hh שמור תשמור@it , as in @hh פתוח תפתח@it (above 15:8), @hh נתון תתן@it (ibid. v. 10). (@ITRe”m@it) "
Deuteronomy 28:4, Why are they called @HB עשתרות@BO ?@bo See above @ITparshas@it Eikev (7:13) where I have explained this. 
Deuteronomy 29:3," To recognize Hashem’s benevolence, etc.@bo But [the verse does not mean] not to know the great miracles and the signs and wonders, as the simple connotation of the verse implies, because regarding these the verse would not say “a knowledgeable mind, etc.” @d1I have heard: because on that day, etc.”@bo Rashi is explaining how it is possible that before this they did not have eyes and ears. @d1How is it that you are empowering your fellow tribesmen over it, etc.@bo That is, over the Torah. "
Deuteronomy 30:3," As it is said, “You shall be plucked, etc.@bo This prophecy was said regarding the exile of Bavel. "
Deuteronomy 31:2," This explains I cannot any longer, etc.@bo It is as if he said, Because Hashem has said to me, ‘You will not cross over [the Yardein], etc. Yehoshua will cross.’ But it is not because his strength had weakened, for it is written, His appearance was not dulled and his freshness did not fade [Devarim 34:7]. For one cannot say, for Hashem is [a phrase] on its own, as if it had said, I am no longer able, and furthermore, for Hashem said to me, because the meaning of I am no longer able is I have no permission, if so that is the meaning of that the Holy One, Blessed Is He said to me do not cross. Therefore [Rashi] explains that for Hashem said is an explanation. As if to say, I am no longer able @ITbecause@it Hashem said, etc. The [letter] @ITvav@it [meaning and] of And Hashem means because, as in [the verse] And there was no man (Bereishis 2:5) which means Because there was no man. @d1This teaches that he was sealed off from the masoretic teachings, etc.@bo The reason is so that he should not be upset that the greatness was taken from him and given to Yehoshua. For once the traditions of wisdom were blocked from him, why would [he wish to continue to] live? If you ask: Why does Rashi switch [the verse] and first explain I cannot any longer go forth and return and afterward he explains I am today [One hundred and twenty years old] which is not in the order [written] in the verse? And another question: This another interpretation should have been said immediately, before I am today. One can answer in the manner of @ITpilpul@it: I cannot any longer go forth and return, ‘perhaps, etc.’ until ‘for Hashem has said to me, etc.’ And Rashi asks on this: If you were to ask, that the midrash says that Today my days [and years are completed], etc., which implies that if not for this reason For Hashem said to me, etc. he would not have been able to go forth and return! And he answers, Really, etc. as I explained. And what you asked, that the Midrash says Today my days [and years] were completed, etc. which implies that without this reason of For Hashem has said to me, etc. he would not have been able to go forth and return! One can answer that the Midrash explains to go forth and return in a different manner, [as Rashi himself explains in the] alternative answer: To go forth and return, “with respect to words of Torah, etc.” [in the name of @ITMaharitz@it]. According to the alternative answer one must explain For Hashem has said [to me], etc. according to its plain meaning, that Hashem said. [@ITRe”m@it] "
Deuteronomy 32:1," That I admonish the Israelites.@bo Rashi is answering the question: How could Moshe command the heavens? Does he rule over heaven? And a further question: Why did he take testimony against Yisroel for they had not yet sinned? Therefore he explains that “I admonish [i.e., warn] the Israelites,” as it is written above, “I invoke as witnesses (@hh העדתי@hh@ee ) against you this day, heaven and earth” (Devarim 30:19). This is an expression of admonishing [i.e., warning], similar to, “The man warned us repeatedly (@hh העד העיד@hh@ee )” (Bereishis 43:3). For [Moshe] had not yet said anything to heaven or earth, and it is only now that he speaks to them. @d1So that you may serve as witnesses to the matter. For so I informed them, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: Perhaps Yisroel would not accept heaven and earth as witnesses [against them]. Therefore Rashi explains, “for so I have informed them.” In other words, “I have already said to them.” @d1Similarly, “let the earth hear.”@bo This means that you should not say that since it is written, “Listen heaven @ITand@it earth as I declare,” the Torah must be speaking about two separate matters. Rather it means to say and also “let the earth hear” that I am warning Yisroel and you will be witnesses to the matter. The reason that it written regarding he heavens, “hearken” and regarding the earth, “hear” is because Moshe Rabbeinu was cleaving to the heavens, because he was nearing his death, and his soul was now cleaving to the Above. When a person is standing close to his friend, he says “hearken,” and therefore Moshe said, “Hearken [heavens].” But he was distant from the earth, therefore it is appropriate to use the term “hear.” For this reason he did not include them both in the same phrase and say, “Hearken Heaven and earth as I declare, etc.” Re”m explains that the reason he did not combine heaven and earth together is because heaven is deserving of more honor than the earth, and therefore he did not combine them in a single phrase. But his explanation does not answer why Scripture changes its expression and uses the term “hearken” for Heaven and “hear” for the earth. @d1Moshe said, “I am only mortal and tomorrow I may die, etc.@bo If you ask: Why does Rashi in parshas @ITNitzovim@it (Devarim 30:19) offer a different reason for the verse, “I invoke, as witnesses against you this day, heaven and earth”? One can answer that above, regarding the warning, the witnesses are required to admonish the person who wants to commit the sin, in order that he will [listen to them and] not sin. If so, it is difficult [to understand], how can heaven and earth give warning? They are unable to speak! One cannot explain that Moshe warned Yisroel before heaven and earth in order that they should not sin, because at that time [when Moshe warned them] they were not intending to sin. It would have been considered a doubtful warning, which is not considered an adequate warning. Therefore Rashi explains [there] “Gaze at the heavens, etc. This type of gazing is considered as if [heaven and earth] were delivering a verbal warning. However, here in this song, [Moshe] is speaking of the punishments for Yisroel, if they transgress Hashem’s mitzvos and worship idols. And regarding punishment it is written, (Devarim 17:7) “Let the hand of the witnesses against him be first” [to punish the sinners]. Therefore [Rashi] gives a different explanation here. "
Deuteronomy *32:36," In this usage, @HB כי@BO is understood as, etc.@bo I.e. it gives an explanation of what precedes it. @d1Understood as “for.”@bo An explanation of [Rashi’s] explanation is that Rabbi Nechemyah explains the verse “For . . . will judge, etc.” as referring to when He represents them in their struggle, and the meaning of @hh כי@hh@ee is “for.” And the meaning of (v. 35), “Vengeance is with Me, and shall administer retribution” (v. 34) refers to the idolaters, because Hashem fights the fight of Yisroel against those who persecuted them. "
Deuteronomy 33:1," Close to his death, etc.@bo Because if you do not explain that before his death means close to his death, we would not know when [Moshe spoke]. Therefore Rashi writes, For if not now when,” because it was before his death and close to his death. Alternatively, his proof is because it is written @ITbefore@it his death, as it is obvious that he did not bless them after his death. However, if the verse had not written before his death, I might have thought he blessed them a long time before his death. Therefore it is written before his death to teach us that it was close to his death (Sifri cited by @ITRe”m@it) "
Deuteronomy 34:1," There were a number of elevations, etc.@bo Otherwise, the verse should only have said Moshe went up to Mount Nevo. Why does it say from the plains of Moav”? Do we not know already that Moshe was in the plains of Moav since the whole of Devarim was taught in the plains of Moav? @d1He showed him all of Eretz Yisroel in its tranquility, etc.@bo Rashi is answering the question: The verse should only have said the entire land until the rearward sea. Why do I need all these details, the Gilod, etc.? And because of this reason he [also] has to explain [what is hinted in] the Negev and the plain, etc. "
