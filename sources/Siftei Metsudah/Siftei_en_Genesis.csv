Genesis 2:2," R. Shimon said, flesh and blood who cannot know. . .@p3 Rashi is answering the question: @hh ויכל אלהים @hbב@hhיום השביעי@ee implies that Hashem worked even on the seventh day, but concluded the work then. Yet it is written, “He abstained on the seventh day,” implying that He did no work at all. [Thus Rashi explains, “It @ITappears@it as if He concluded His work on that very day.”] @p1@p2It can enter into it@p3. I.e., the work enters into Shabbos. @p1@p2And it appears@p3. I.e., it appears to people as if Hashem concluded His work on that day, but it is not really so. Thus, “Elohim completed on the seventh day” describes the appearance, not the reality. @p1@p2Another explanation: What was the world lacking? Rest@p3. You might ask: Why cannot the world exist without [a day devoted to] rest? Will heaven and earth otherwise cease to exist? The answer is: In fact they would [cease to exist], for Rashi explained above (1:1) that @hh בראשית@ee means that the world was created for the Torah which is called @hh ראשית דרכו@ee . And without a day of rest, Jews would not have time all week to engage in Torah study. Thus Hashem created Shabbos on which work is forbidden, giving them time to study Torah. Consequently, the existence of heaven and earth is due to rest. @p1@p2The work was completed and finished@p3. This explains why it is written, “Elohim completed @ITon@it the seventh day,” since rest was created on the seventh day and all the work was completed. [At the same time, “He abstained on the seventh day,”] because rest is only an act of abstaining and not actual work. (@ITRe’m@it) Rashi’s second explanation [that the world lacked rest], raises a question: Why does it say @hb מלאכתו@hh אשר עשה@ee implying that Hashem did actual work? Thus Rashi gives the first explanation. And his first explanation, [that it entered by a hairbreadth,] raises a question: Why is it not written, “Elohim completed on the @ITsixth@it day”? Therefore Rashi gives both explanations. (@ITMaharshal@it) [You might ask:] How can the terms “creation” and “work” apply to rest, which is only an act of abstention [passive] and does not involve a physical action? It seems [that the answer is]: Had Hashem not added the seventh day to the days of creation, the nature of man and other creatures would be to work day and night without cease. Resting would not be part of nature, and the body of man would wear out, leaving the world empty and desolate. But by adding the seventh day, on which Hashem abstained from work and rested, it became part of the world’s nature to rest and refresh oneself, regaining strength. [Thus, it is part of creation.] (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) "
Genesis 3:1," Why is this incident inserted here@p3? @ITRe’m@it asks: How does Rashi know that the coats were made right at Adam and Chavah’s creation, to protect from cold and heat, giving rise to the question: “Why is this incident inserted here?” Perhaps the coats were made only after they sinned by eating from the tree, to cover their shame of being naked! This way, the verses are in proper sequence [and Rashi’s question does not arise]. It seems that Rashi knew it because it is written (v. 20), “The man called his wife’s name Chavah,” and subsequently, (v. 21) “And Hashem Elokim made for Adam and his wife leather coats.” Rashi explains that this verse “And man gave names. . .,” returns to the earlier narrative. As the naming of Chavah was before the sin, and is connected to “And Hashem made. . . leather coats,” we can conclude that right at their creation Hashem made them coats [to protect from cold and heat]. Thus, the coats were not made to cover their shame after they sinned. An alternative answer is: [Rashi knew it] because it is written, “Hashem made. . . leather coats and @ITHe@it clothed them.” Why, because they sinned, would Hashem have to clothe them Himself?! They should clothe themselves, just as they made for themselves loincloths. It should have written, “Hashem made. . . leather coats @ITfor clothing@it.” Perforce, Hashem made them coats right at their creation to protect from cold and heat. @ITRe’m@it asks: [If they had coats from the beginning,] why were they “naked” (v. 25)? The answer is: According to the opinion (Bereishis Rabba 20:12) that @hh כתנות עור@ee means fingernail-like garments, smooth [and transparent], which cleaved to their skin, they were as naked. Although it was attached to their skin, their entire body was revealed, including the loins. And even according to the opinion (ibid) that the garments were of rabbit fur, to protect from cold and heat, still they were naked — for Adam was created in Tishrei (according to Rabbi Eliezer), or in Nisan (according to Rabbi Yehoshua), when it is neither cold nor hot; [thus they were not dressed.] They were not embarrassed to be naked since they did not yet eat from the tree. The serpent “saw them unclothed, indulging in marital relations unashamedly, and he coveted her.” We need not ask: If so, why did they take fig leaves to make loincloths? They should have worn the coats! [The answer is:] Indeed they could have. But just then the coats were not available to them and they did not want to stand naked for even a moment. In any case, this point [of when the garments were created] seems to be disputed. For it says in Pesachim 54a: “Ten things were created at twilight on Erev Shabbos. . . and some say: ‘Also Adam’s garments.’” The second view holds that the garments were created @ITafter@it they sinned, for they sinned in the tenth hour of the day, which is before twilight. But the first view could hold that the garments were created before the sin. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2Indulging in marital relations@p3. You might ask: Where does the verse allude to marital relations? The answer is: The verse could just say, “The two of them were naked.” Why does it add, “The man and his wife”? This implies that besides being naked, they acted as man and wife. (@ITAb’a@it) @p1@p2More cunning@p3. . . Rashi is answering the question: Why does it say, “More. . . than any”? Because being “More cunning than any” led to becoming “More cursed than any.” @p1@p2Did He perhaps tell@p3. [Rashi explained @hh אף@ee as “perhaps”] because it cannot mean “even more so,” coming as it does at the beginning of the serpent’s statement. @p1@p2And, although he saw them. . .@p3 The Torah does not recount [that he saw them eat], but it must be so: otherwise, what did they eat? (@ITRe’m@it) @eeBut this is no proof — perhaps they ate herbs and legumes! Rather, Rashi knows [that he saw them eat] because the serpent said, “You should not eat from @ITall@it the trees of the Garden?” If he saw that they were eating only herbs and legumes, he should have said simply, “You should not eat from the @ITtrees@it of the Garden?” Since he said “@ITall@it the trees,” he must have seen them eating other fruits. But he saw them eating sporadically: they would eat figs but not grapes, and then eat from another nearby tree. Since he saw them eating some fruits and leaving others, there was room for his question: Are you doing this out of choice, because the other fruits are not as good, or is it because Hashem commanded you not to eat from all the trees of the Garden — and therefore you eat only some of them? "
Genesis 4:1," This. . . before he sinned. @p3Rashi is answering the question: It should have been written @hh וַיֵדַע@ee [rather than @hh יָדַע@ee ]. @p1@p2Children were born to him@p3. Rashi used the expression “children were born to him” rather than “he knew his wife” because otherwise Rashi would be implying that Adam knew her only after he was exiled, not before. [And this is not true,] for earlier, on the verse of “This at last is bone of my bones. . .” (2:23), Rashi says: “Adam attempted to find a mate amongst all the animals. . . until he discovered Chavah.” This implies that Adam had relations with Chavah at that point. This answers another question: How does Rashi know that Adam’s “knowing his wife” before he was exiled included conception and birth as well? Perhaps it was referring only to relations. The answer is: “This at last is bone of my bones. . .” already taught us that Adam had relations. Thus, the verse “The man knew his wife. . .” perforce [includes conception and birth]. @p1@p2With Hashem@p3. This comment is out of sequence, because Rashi did not wish to state that the word @hh את@ee “implies additional facts or things” before he explained @hh את ה'@ee , [which is understood differently]. Once he explained that @hh את ה'@ee means “with Hashem,” rather than “implying additional facts or things,” he can then state: “The word @hh את@ee is repeated thrice, to expound additional facts or things.” (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) @p1@p2We are co-partners with Him@p3. For there are three partners in [the formation of] a person: Hashem, the person’s father, and the person’s mother. (@ITNidah@it 31a) @p1@p2Consequently, it says: “And she increased.” @p3In other words, it means, that “she increased an @hh את@ee .” This is because two instances of @hh את@ee imply two additional children. This fully explains why the word @hh ותוסף@ee is written. "
Genesis 5:1," That on the same day that he was created he begot@p3. [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “This is the book of the generations of man on the day. . .” implying that on the day he was created he had offspring. Accordingly, “On the day,” is attached to “generations of man,” rather than to “He made him in the likeness of Hashem” which follows. For otherwise, why does it say, “On the day Elohim created?” The Torah should have simply written, “The generations of man, in the image of Hashem He made them,” and that would suffice. Perforce, “This is the book of the generations of man” refers back to (4:1), “The man knew his wife, Chavah” and she gave birth to Kayin and Hevel. "
Genesis 6:2," When they improved (@hh מטיבין@p1@p2 ) her appearance@p3. This is similar to the expression @hh מטיבין את הנרות@ee . It means this because @hh טֹבֹת@ee conveys that they just now became fair, similar to @hh ועפרון ישֵׁב@ee (23:10), conveying that Ephron just now sat. Furthermore, @hh טבת@ee without a @ITvav@it is a singular expression, implying that not all women were fair, only individual women — the beautified brides. But if it were written @hh טובות@ee , a plural expression, it would imply that the women were always fair, i.e., beautified. @p1@p2Even a man or an animal@p3. [Rashi knows this] because it says @hh נשים מכל אשר בחרו@ee . The word @hh נשים@ee implies “even a married woman,” while @hh אשר בחרו@ee implies “even a man or an animal.” (@ITRe’m@it) @ITRe’m@it asks: It says in Kiddushin 13a that they did not commit adultery. [Why then does Rashi say, “even a married woman”?] @ITNachalas Yaakov @itanswers: It seems that only the sons of rulers committed adultery, not the common people, because @hh נשים מכל אשר בחרו@ee refers back to: “The sons of the rulers saw.” That is why Rashi says, “The head ruler would then enter and have relations. . . .” However, @ITRe’m@it suggests that these might be two conflicting opinions. "
Genesis 7:1," [We learn] from this that we tell@bo. . . This raises a question: Now that the Torah taught us the proper conduct of telling only @hh מקצת@ee , i.e., part of a man’s good qualities, the man will understand on his own that his good qualities are double this, [thus defeating the purpose]! It seems the answer is: Telling @hh מקצת@ee does not necessarily mean half. It could be a small amount: a tenth or a hundredth. Thus, the man will not know the extent of his good qualities. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) "
Genesis 8:1," The merit that they did not corrupt@bo. . . This implies that the other animals corrupted their ways on their own, not due to demons. Otherwise, what was the merit of these animals? The same is implied by, “They did not cohabit in the ark,” meaning, on their own. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) Both merits were needed, since “not corrupting their ways” was not an active mitzvah; it was merely refraining from sin. (Although it says in Makkos 23b that he who passively refrains from a sin is rewarded as if he did a mitzvah, but it says in Kiddushin 39b that this applies only when a chance to sin presented itself but he held back.) Therefore the animals needed also the merit of not cohabiting in the ark, which was self-imposed abstinence from permitted behavior. But this merit alone was insufficient, as it somewhat resembled doing a mitzvah without being commanded, [which is a lesser merit]. For we have no source to indicate that the animals were forbidden to cohabit in the ark. Hashem forbade only Noach and his sons. Although Rashi later says that, “Let them spread over the @ITearth@it” (v. 17), teaches that the animals had a prohibition to propagate in the ark, they accepted this upon themselves without Hashem’s command. Why does the verse not say that Hashem remembered also the birds and Noach’s sons? It seems the answer is: Cham, and the raven, sinned by cohabiting in the ark. That is why Noach’s sons and the birds are not mentioned. [If so, why are beasts and animals mentioned, when the dog cohabited in the ark (Bereishis Rabba 36:7)? The answer is:] There is an uncertainty about dogs. Perhaps they are in the category of “beasts”; perhaps in that of “animals.” Although Heaven surely knows, still, the Sages disagreed about it. Thus we see that Hashem’s will is not to resolve it, and therefore, Scripture does not omit either beasts or animals [although dogs are included in one of these two categories]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @d1A spirit of comforting@bo. Rashi is answering the question: If it was an actual wind, why is written afterwards, “And the water subsided”? On the contrary, it is written (Tehillim 147:8), “He blows His wind; water runs.” [I.e., wind does not calm the waters.] (@ITDevek Tov@it) Alternatively, Rashi knows this because it says, “Over the @ITearth@it.” How could a wind blow over the earth’s surface when the water covered the earth? But if it was “a spirit of comforting,” it is understandable. “Over the earth” then means, “On account of the matters of the earth.” In other words, for the sake of man who dwells on the earth. "
Genesis 9:3," “I did not permit@bo. . . The reason why Noach was permitted to eat meat, while Adam was not, seems to be as follows: Previously, men and animals were equal in that they all were Hashem’s creations. He formed them all from the earth; none had higher status than the other [as regards their bodies]. Why should one kill the other? But when they sinned, all should have been destroyed, and they survived only in Noach’s merit. This gave Noach a higher status than the animals. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) Scripture connected the permission to eat meat to that of eating vegetables so we will not say that meat is now permitted @ITinstead@it of vegetables, and vegetables are no longer permitted. Thus Scripture tells us that eating meat is in @ITaddition@it to eating vegetables. (@ITDivrei Dovid@it) "
Genesis 10:2," This refers to Persia@bo. You might ask: Why does Rashi explain Tiras any more than the others? The answer is: Rashi said on 9:27 (@hh ד""ה וישכון@ee ) that “Cyrus, Yefes’ descendant, built the Second Temple.” And one might ask: How does Rashi know that Cyrus came from Yefes? Thus Rashi explains here that Tiras is Persia, so Persia is from Yefes. And Cyrus, king of Persia, assumedly descended from Tiras. Furthermore, the @ITRe’m@it says that Rashi [explains Tiras because he] is answering the question: Why here is it written @hh מדי@ee , not @hh פרס@ee ? These two nations are always mentioned together! Thus Rashi explains that Tiras is @hh פרס@ee . But @ITTzeidah L’Derech@it says that [it is not as the @ITRe’m @itsaid. Rather, Rashi explains Tiras because] it is from Yoma 10a: “How do we know that the Persians come from Yefes? Because it is written, ‘The sons of Yefes were: Gomer. . . and Tiras.’ And Rav Yosef taught: Tiras is Persia.” [Thus, Rashi brings it to prove that Cyrus came from Yefes.] "
Genesis 11:1," The holy language. @boFor if it was another language, there would not be only one language [on earth, as the holy language remained until this point.]. For all agree that the world was created with the holy language, as Rashi explained on (2:23): “The man said, ‘This at last. . . shall be called @hh אשה@ee .’” @d1Another explanation: Against the Sole Being of the universe. @boThere is a question on the first explanation: Why does it not say @hb ב@hhדברים אחדים@ee (@ITwith@it conforming words)? Thus Rashi says, “Another explanation. . .” But this answer also raises a difficulty: Why does it not say @hh ודברים אחרים@ee (and @ITother@it words)? Thus Rashi offers the third explanation, which interprets @hh דברים אחדים@ee to mean @hh דברים חדים@ee (sharp words). (@ITMaharshal@it) "
Genesis 12:1," It is there that I will make you into a great nation@p3. Rashi is explaining his comment of above: “For your own benefit, for your own good.” What is the good? “I will make you into a great nation.” And what is the benefit? “I will make your character known to the world.” Since the next verse elaborates by saying, “I will make you into a great nation . . . and make your name great,” we learn that it was for this purpose that Hashem told Avraham to go there. The [repetitive phrase] @hh לך לך@ee does not present a difficulty, for [similarly] it is written in Shir HaShirim 2:11: @hh הגשם חלף הלך לו@ee . Thus we could explain the phrase @hh לך לך@ee is common in Scripture. Nevertheless we explain [such a phrase] where possible, [as Rashi does here]. So wrote @ITRe’m@it, but it seems to me that it indeed presents a difficulty everywhere it appears. With @hh הגשם חלף הלך לו@ee , it means that the rain ceased, following its nature and inclination. But here, Hashem told Avraham to “Go from your land” against his will, [so that explanation does not fit]. Thus Rashi explains, “For your benefit . . .” The @ITMaharshal@it writes: There is a difficulty with Rashi’s first explanation, [“It is there that I will make you into a great nation.” For in v. 2,] we need to insert the phrase, “@ITIt is there that.@it” Thus Rashi offers the second explanation, “I will make your character known to the world.” But according to this explanation, a question arises: What is meant by (v. 2), “I will make you into a great nation”? Therefore, Rashi needs both explanations. "
Genesis 13:1," To arrive at the south of Eretz Yisrael.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Avraham was [already] in the south, for Egypt is south of Eretz Yisrael and in the south of the world. Accordingly, why is it not written, “Avraham went up north”? Thus Rashi explains, “To arrive at the south of Eretz Yisrael.” "
Genesis 14:1," Who told Avraham, “Jump . . .”@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Was not Nimrod [not Amraphel] the king of Shinar? "
Genesis 15:5," But @p3@BO@ITAvraham@bo@it@BO @bo@BO@ITwill@bo@it@BO have a son@bo. Although he had Yishmael while he was still called Avram, it says in Kiddushin 68b: “Your son from a nonJewess is not called your son.” Therefore, Yishmael could not be his heir. @BOThis explains the use of the term @bo@hh הבטה@ee@BO : from above to below@bo. You might ask: If so, why does it say (Bamidbar 21:9), “He would look (@hh והביט@ee ) upon the copper snake and live,” [although he was lower than the snake]? The answer is: It means the @ITcopper snake@it would “look” upon him. And why is it written (Tehillim 34:6), “They looked (@hh הביטו@ee ) to Him and became radiant,” which is from below to above? The answer is: Hashem is found everywhere. (@ITsource unknown@it) But @ITRe’m@it explains: Rashi is saying that the @hh הבטה@ee mentioned @IThere@it is from above to below, [but not everywhere else]. "
Genesis 16:1," She was Pharaoh’s daughter . . . @p3 Rashi knows this because it is written @hh לה שפחה@ee , even though everything a woman acquires belongs to her husband, [so Hagar really belonged to Avraham]. It must be that Hagar was Pharaoh’s daughter and he gave her to Sarah. Therefore it is written @hh ולה שפחה@ee to hint to the miracles performed “@hh לה@ee ” — for Sarah — which Pharaoh saw. "
Genesis 17:1," I am the One Whose Godliness suffices@p3. Avraham had said to Hashem: “If I circumcise myself, people will regard me with disgust!” Hashem answered him: “I am the One Who said to My world: It suffices . . .” (@ITMaharshal@it) @BOThis, too, is an imperative following an imperative, “Be perfect . . .” @bo[Rashi is answering the question:] Since it is already written, “Walk before Me,” what was added by, “And be perfect”? Rashi explains that this, too, is a command. It is one imperative following another, saying: “Be perfect in all My tests.” @BONow you are lacking five organs . . . @bo The @ITRe’m@it writes: These organs, over which a person lacks full control, lead him to sin. But because of Avraham’s great righteousness, Hashem gave him control over them. For it is written (Shmuel I, 2:9), “The feet of His pious ones He will guard”: when one overcomes one’s @ITyetzer hara,@it in the end Hashem gives one full control over it [see @ITYoma @it38b]. @BOTwo eyes@bo . . . You might ask: Could Avraham really have lacked all these organs? The answer is: Surely he had them, but since he did not control them, it was as if he lacked them. Hashem now told him that they would all be under his control. Question: Did Avraham not lack the heart as well, as he was still uncircumcised of heart? The answer is: Only external organs are counted here. Furthermore, it is written in Nechemiah 9:8: “You found his [Avraham’s] heart faithful before You. And [then] You made the @ITbris@it with him.” We see that even before circumcision, Avraham’s heart was hardly [considered as] uncircumcised. (@ITMaharshal@it) "
Genesis 18:1," To visit the sick person@p3. You might ask: How did Rashi know this? The answer is: Because it is written, “Hashem appeared to @IThim@it,” rather than, “Hashem appeared to @ITAvraham@it.” [And why is this?] Perforce, it does not mention Avraham explicitly because it relates back to the previous passage regarding the bris milah, where it is expressly written, “To Avraham.” If so, why did Hashem appear to him now? Not to command him about milah—as He already commanded him, and he already performed milah on himself and on the members of his household. It must be that [since Avraham was sick due to the milah,] He came to visit the sick. Alternatively, Rashi knew this because the verse does not go on to explain why Hashem appeared to him. Thus we may assume it was to visit the sick. Question: Why does Rashi say, “To visit the sick person,” rather than simply saying, “To visit him”? [The answer is:] Because we learn from here the mitzvah of visiting the sick, as it says in Bava Metzia 86b. Since it was not limited to Avraham, Rashi says: “To visit the sick person.” @p1@p2It was the third day since his circumcision . . .@p3 [Rashi knows this] because He appeared to him in order to visit him, thus it makes sense that it was on the third day, since he was in the most pain then. For it says (34:25): “On the third day when they were in pain.” The @ITRe’m@it asks: On the contrary, the danger on the third day is less than the danger during the first two days, for it says in Shabbos 134b that [according to the first Tanna] we may wash a circumcised infant [with warm water on Shabbos during the first two days after milah, but not on the third day, when he is in less danger]. If so, how did R. Chama bar Chanina [cited by Rashi] know that He appeared to Avraham was on the third day? Perhaps it was on the second day! Granted it was not the first day, when he was busy doing his own milah and that of his servants, but perhaps it was the second day. It seems to me that the answer is: The Tannaim (@ITibid.@it) only disagree regarding the milah of an infant, who is more exposed to danger on the first and second day than on the third day. The first Tanna holds that an infant’s wound heals very quickly [and the third day poses less danger]. Whereas R. Eliezer holds there is no difference between the first two days and the third day, and cites the verse, [“On the third day when they were in pain,” about the men of Shechem,] although it is not conclusive proof. But for the milah of an adult, all agree that the third day poses a greater danger than the first two. For the verse testifies: “On the third day when they were in pain,” which Onkelos explains as, “When their pains were the strongest.” And so the Rambam explains the third day’s pains (Peirush HaMishnayos, Shabbos 19:3): “Fluids flow down and create swelling, increasing the pain.” It is likely that an infant is different in this respect, as he has less fluid. His danger is the wound itself, thus on the third day his danger is less, since his wound heals quickly. But an adult’s wound is not as dangerous in itself, for he can withstand a knife wound, as is well known. [His danger is from] the fluids, which do not accumulate so much at first. It seems to me that the answer is: The Halachah states (Yoreh De’ah 335) that one should not visit the sick person on the first two days. [Therefore, it must have been the third day.] (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) The @ITRe’m@it asked: On v. 18:6, “Knead it and make cake-rolls,” the Midrash commented (Bereishis Rabba 48:12): “It was Erev Pesach.” And so it says in v. 19:3 [regarding Lot], “He baked matzos,” upon which Rashi himself comments: “It was Pesach.” Thus the Midrash must be of the opinion that Hashem visited Avraham on the very day of the milah, the fifteenth of Nisan, [since Yitzchok was born one year from the milah (see 17:21), and was born on the fifteenth of Nisan (see Rashi, 18:10). And since Hashem’s visit was Erev Pesach after noon, it was considered the fifteenth of Nisan]. But R. Chama [cited by Rashi here] is of the opinion that the visit was on the seventeenth of Nisan, [which is the third day]. If so, why did Rashi cite conflicting Aggados? The @ITRe’m@it elaborated but did not explain it well. It seems to me that the answer is simple: According to all opinions, the milah was on the twelfth of Nisan, and the visit was on the fifteenth of Nisan. And, [as Rashi mentioned on 21:2,] the angel scratched a mark on the wall [to mark the date]. This was done on the 16th, [so as not to desecrate Yom Tov]. At that point Hashem said (v. 14): “At the appointed time (@hh למועד@ee ) I shall return,” [referring to the 15th of Nisan of the coming year. You might ask:] On the day of the milah it said (17:21): @hh למועד הזה@ee , but on the day of Hashem’s visit it says: @hh למועד@ee , without @hh הזה@ee . [If so, why was Yitzchok born the following year on the day of the visit, rather than on the day of the milah? The answer is]: Rashi explained on v. 14 as follows: “@hh למועד@ee , i.e., on the @hh מועד@ee that I previously set for you when I said (17:21), ‘@hh למועד הזה@ee next year.’” And the reference works in reverse as well: when Hashem said on the day of the milah: “@hh למועד הזה@ee next year,” it actually referred to the day of the visit. And so Rashi explained on 21:2 [that it refers to the day of the visit]; see Rashi there. @p1@p2Therefore, He appeared to him in his territory@p3. It seems that Rashi is not attempting to answer the question of why Hashem appeared to Avraham specifically there, as Avraham might have simply happened to be there at the time [when Hashem chose to appear]. Rather, Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture need to @ITinform@it us that Hashem appeared to him there, [when we would know this on our own? For] it already said that Avraham dwelled in the groves of Mamrei. Assumedly, Hashem appeared to him there, since that is where he circumcised himself and his household. And he surely did not leave, as he was still recovering from the milah; in fact Hashem came to visit him [for that reason]. The @ITRe’m@it asks: How did Rashi know that Mamrei advised him? Perhaps Hashem appeared to Avraham there simply because Avraham’s tent was there on that day. He answers: Rashi knew it from the extra phrase, [“In the groves of Mamrei”]. It could have said simply, “Adonoy appeared to him and he was sitting . . .” as it does for other prophecies, [where the place is not mentioned]. This answer is similar to what I explained above. Alternatively: Rashi knew [that Mamrei advised Avraham] because it said in Parshas Lech Lecha (14:13), @hh באלוני ממרא האמורי@ee . And @hh האמורי@ee implies that Mamrei said (@hh אמר@ee ) to Avraham to perform Hashem’s command. Question: How could one suggest that Avraham Avinu asked advice whether or not to fulfill Hashem’s command? Avraham was a great tzaddik who withstood ten trials! The @ITRe’m@it explains that Avraham surely would have done the milah anyway, as commanded by his Creator. Avraham asked Eshkol, Aneir and Mamrei for advice since they were his allies and spoke to them as his friends, but Avraham wanted to test their sincerity. If they will advise him to circumcise, they are sincere friends. In the end, Eshkol and Aneir advised him against circumcising, and only Mamrei advised him to circumcise. Avraham thereby knew what was in their hearts. The @ITRe’m@it offers another answer: Avraham asked their advice because he assumed they would advise him not to circumcise, yet he would do it anyway—making his reward greater. A further answer: Avraham sought advice whether to circumcise himself in private or in public, as he was concerned lest people come and prevent him. Mamrei said to do it publicly, for people will not be able to stop him. This is in accord with 17:23 where it is written @hh בעצם היום@ee , [on which Rashi comments that Avraham performed the milah openly, without fear of intervention]. (@ITMahari@it) It seems to me [that the answer is]: Avraham asked whether to circumcise in public, as nowhere does it say he was commanded to do it publicly. Aneir and Eshkol were opposed, as it says in Midrash Tanchuma Vayeira 3, while Mamrei enheartened him to circumcise in public, and not to be concerned at all about his enemies. Hashem rewarded Mamrei accordingly, measure for measure, and appeared [to Avraham] in his territory. Although Rashi said in 17:23 that Hashem told Avraham not to fear, that was after Mamrei advised him [not to be concerned about his enemies], to which Hashem concurred. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) A further answer: The Midrash says that Avraham circumcised Eshkol and Aneir, and they died. Mamrei told [i.e., advised] him: “The others will not survive unless you circumcise yourself.” This is as it says (17:13): @hh המל ימול@ee , the first word spelled without a @hh ו@ee , implying that he who circumcises himself (@hh הַמָל@ee ) may circumcise others (@hh ימול@ee ). [See also Yerushalmi, Shabbos 19:2. But in present-day Torah scrolls it is written @hh המול@ee .] Avraham then began to circumcise himself, but could not [finish], due to the pain. Hashem came and helped him, as it says (Nechemiah 9:8): “@hh וכרות עמו הברית@ee (and You cut the bris @ITwith him@it).” And since Mamrei advised him regarding the milah, Hashem appeared to him in Mamrei’s territory. Question: If Hashem would not appear to Avraham in Mamrei’s territory, where would He appear? Avraham dwelled in Mamrei’s territory! The answer is: Hashem caused Avraham to dwell there in order to bring about Mamrei’s reward. You might ask: Why did Avraham seek advice regarding milah, but not regarding any other mitzvah? An answer is: Avraham did not need advice whether to wait until he was commanded [before he fulfilled] the other mitzvos, as he knew he would not be commanded regarding any other mitzvah. An alternative answer: Even should he be commanded later concerning another mitzvah, this is no reason to refrain from performing it before—as he can always perform it later, in fulfillment of the command. But milah cannot be done a second time. I later heard that this answer is written in @ITMishpetei Shmuel.@it (@ITTzeidah L’Derech@it) @p1@p2It is written @HB ישב@BO . . .@p3 Rashi is saying that @hh יושב@ee is present tense. It conveys that Avraham was sitting before, and still is. But @hh ישב@ee is past tense, and conveys that he was sitting before but not now. If so, [we might ask,] why did he stand? Thus Rashi explains: Avraham wanted to rise, to honor the Shechinah, but Hashem said to him: “Sit . . .” This is preferable to the @ITRe’m’s@it explanation, see there. The @ITNachalas Yaakov@it writes: It seems to me that Rashi means that @hh יֹשֵב@ee lacking a @hh ו@ee implies that Avraham’s sitting was lacking, as he wanted to rise. The same goes for @hh ועפרון יֹשֵב@ee (23:10). There, too, Ephron’s sitting [as an officer] was lacking, for they appointed him only that day. @p1@p2And you will symbolize to your descendants that I am destined . . .@p3 It seems that Rashi is answering the question: It says in Moed Katan 27b, “We tell anyone to sit, [after he stands for the Nasi] — except for a mourner and a sick person,” as then it would connote that he should “sit” [i.e., stay] in his mourning or his sickness. And here, Hashem came to visit a sick person. Why did He tell him to sit? Thus Rashi explains: “You will symbolize . . .” (@ITTzeidah L’Derech@it) @p1@p2To see if there are any passers by that he might invite into his home.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Do sick people usually sit at the door of the tent? They usually sit or lie on a bed [inside]! Thus Rashi explains: “To see . . .” @p1@p2God brought the sun out of its sheath . . .@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know this? Perhaps it anyway was a hot day! The answer is: It is written @hb כ@hhחם היום@ee , rather than @hb ב@hhחם היום@ee , implying that the heat of the day was @ITlike@it that mentioned elsewhere (Malachi 3:19): “For lo, the day (@hh היום@ee ) comes, glowing like a furnace.” This forced Rashi to explain: “God brought the sun out . . .” But it seems to me that [Rashi knew this because] if @hh כחום היום@ee indicates what time of day it was, Avraham should have sat earlier at the door of the tent to look for passersby to invite. For it says in Berachos 27a and Bereishis Rabbah 48:8 that @hh כחום היום@ee is the sixth hour, and @hh וחם השמש@ee (Shemos 16:21) is the fourth hour. And mealtime is at the fourth hour, as it says in Shabbos 10a and Pesachim 12b. Perforce, the verse must be explaining @ITwhy@it he was sitting at the door of the tent, [not @ITwhen@it]. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @p1@p2He brought the angels to him in the guise of men.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Did Hashem not need anyway to bring the angels, as we see from the story’s continuation? Thus Rashi explains that Hashem indeed needed to bring them anyway — but not in the guise of men. That was for Avraham’s sake. "
Genesis 19:1," Elsewhere they are called men.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: By calling them angels, the verse implies that they [appeared as angels and] wore angels’ garments. But this cannot be; why then would Lot bake matzos [for them]? Perforce, they appeared to him as men. Thus Rashi explains, “Elsewhere they are called men . . .” I.e., they are merely @ITcalled@it so, not that they [now] divested themselves of physicality. Regarding Avraham they were called men, out of respect for the Divine Presence. But with Lot, the Divine Presence was not there — so they are called angels. @p1@p2When the Divine Presence was with them they are called men . . .@p3 There is a difficulty with this explanation: It is obvious that angels have no importance relative to the Divine Presence. [Why does the verse switch terms to teach this?] Thus Rashi offers “another explanation.” And there is a difficulty with that as well: Why not call them men everywhere? And if you object that we would not know they were angels, so call them angels [everywhere]! And if [the term is switched] to teach that angels were common [to Avraham but not to Lot], do we not already know that Avraham was a greater tzaddik than Lot? Therefore, we need the first explanation too. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2They appointed him to be their judge@p3. You might ask: How does Rashi know that he was a judge? The answer is: It is written he was “sitting at the gate,” and “the gate” is usually the place of judgment, as we find with Boaz (Ruth 4:1). Furthermore, it is written later @hh וישפט שפוט@ee (v. 9), implying he was a judge. @p1@p2He had learned from the house of Avraham to seek out travelers@p3. It cannot be because he was [generally] careful about mitzvah performance, as he was not careful about idolatry: he had them lodge before they washed (see Rashi 18:4). "
Genesis 20:1," When he saw that the cities were destroyed and the travelers ceased . . .@p3 This explanation raises the question: Why did he go to Gerar, which is very distant? Therefore Rashi brings the alternate explanation. Since he wished to distance himself from Lot, he traveled to Gerar which was an inhabited place. (@ITMaharshal@it) "
Genesis 21:1," To teach you that whoever prays for mercy for another . . .@p3 You might ask: How does this prove it? Perhaps she was remembered now because this was the time Hashem set. She needed to give birth on Pesach, and she was remembered on Rosh Hashanah, so it had to be now. The answer is: Rashi himself answered this when he wrote, “He had already remembered her @ITbefore@it He cured Avimelech.” And what is the verse teaching us by saying that Hashem cured Sarah first? Perforce, “To teach you that whoever prays for mercy for another . . .” (@ITRe’m@it) The @ITRe’m@it objects: Rashi implies that this section is out of place, for he says, “This section was placed here to teach you . . .” But this is not so, for on the fifteenth of Nisan the angel foretold to Sarah, and on the sixteenth, Sedom was overturned and Lot was rescued with his daughters. And right after the incident of Lot with his daughters, Avraham traveled to reside in Gerar, where Sarah was taken and Hashem restrained every womb of Avimelech’s house, whereupon Avraham prayed for them and they were cured. And on Rosh Hashanah, Sarah was remembered. Everything is in chronological order! He answers: @hh וה' פקד@ee implies He remembered her before He cured Avimelech. [Had Sarah conceived after, it would say @hh ויפקוד ה'@ee .] Thus, Avimelech’s curing should not have been written before. And why was it? In order “to teach you that whoever prays for mercy for another . . .” @p1@p2To Avraham@p3. Not to Sarah, as it says nowhere that Hashem spoke to her [about this]. The @ITRe’m@it asks: Why did Rashi not explain that also Hashem’s @ITsaying@it was to Avraham and not to Sarah? He answers: Perhaps because it is written there (17:19), “God said, ‘Indeed your wife Sarah will bear you a son,’” [so it is obvious] that this was said to Avraham; Rashi did not need to explain it. And Rashi did not need to explain it even for Hashem’s @ITspeaking@it, since it is written there (15:1), “The word of Adonoy came to @ITAvram@it.” Rather, Rashi comes to tell us the difference between “Hashem did for Sarah as He @IThad spoken@it,” and “At the designated time that Elokim @IThad spoken@it” (v. 2). The former refers to Avraham, while the latter refers to [His declaration of] the designated time, as Rashi explains there. You might ask: Why does Rashi explain this? The answer is: Rashi means that Hashem said only to Avraham, “That one [Yishmael] will not be your heir” (15:4), and never promised that the heir will come from Sarah. Nevertheless, “Hashem did for Sarah,” although He had spoken only to Avraham. (@ITMaharshal@it) "
Genesis 22:2," @HB נא@ee@p1@p2 is an expression of a request . . .@p3 I.e., @hh נא@ee mentioned here means “request” although in many places it does not mean “request.” (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2So that He not confuse him suddenly, and become bewildered . . .@p3 I.e., so people will not say that Hashem confused him and that is why he did it, but otherwise he would have refrained. It seems that [Rashi added the second explanation, “To endear the mitzvah to him,”] because the first explanation is insufficient on its own, as then it should say@hh את בנך יחידך אשר אהבת@ee . The fact that @hh את@ee is repeated, implies a division [of the verse into separate parts]: each time, Hashem was answering another question of Avraham’s. And the second explanation is insufficient on its own, as then the verse should be reversed [and follow its logical order]: @hh קח את יצחק את בנך את יחידך אשר אהבת@ee . For also [in this order, the use of many expressions would] endear the mitzvah. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) "
Genesis 23:1," The reason @HB שנה@BO is written with every set . . . @boI.e., and Scripture does not gather the ones and the tens in a set, and the hundreds in a separate set, as it did in Parshiyos Bereishis and Noach. Rashi’s is not asking why it says @hh שנה@ee for 100 years whereas it says @hh שנים@ee for seven years, for also in Parshiyos Bereishis and Noach it is always written @hh שנה@ee for hundreds, and @hh שנים@ee for smaller numbers. Rather, Rashi’s question is about the middle @hh שנה@ee , written after twenty, for @hh שנה@ee is never written three times. Perforce, it is meant to be expounded upon. Since one of them is to be expounded, so too are the rest to be expounded. @p1@p2That every set is to be explained by itself@p3. I.e., each set bears its own meaning and does not join with the other sets to form a single sum, as numbers composed of ones, tens and hundreds usually do. This is because the repetitive @hh שנה@ee divides them, placing the ones on their own, and so the tens and the hundreds. According to this [Midrashic interpretation], it is not twenty-seven plus one hundred. Rather, twenty-seven represents the first years @ITwithin@it the one hundred. @p1@p2At one hundred years old she was like a twenty year old, regarding sin.@p3 Rashi implies that from this comparison we learn that all Sarah’s days were good. But Rashi’s next comment — “‘The years of Sarah’s life,’ they were all equally good” — implies that “The years of Sarah’s life” comes to teach that all her days were good. If so, Rashi seems to be contradicting himself! But in fact, this is not a question. On the contrary, from the comparison of one hundred to twenty regarding sin, we would not know that at one hundred she was beautiful as at twenty, since we learn only one quality from each set by itself. Therefore, we still need “‘The years of Sarah’s life,’ they were all equally good.” A further answer: Since @hh שנה@ee is repeated in order to compare one hundred to twenty, which are the first twenty years counting from her birth [see previous entry], therefore, the “twenty-seven” years are @ITwithin@it the one hundred and are not the additional years @ITafter@it the one hundred that the verse’s simple meaning infers. If so, we might think that during the twenty-seven years after the one hundred, she had sin and not beauty. This is why we need “The years of Sarah’s life,” to tell us that they were all equally good. And from “The years of Sarah’s life” alone, we would know just that her years were equally good in one quality. Thus it says @hh שנה@ee after each set, to compare them in both qualities: lack of sin and that she possessed beauty. And “The years of Sarah’s life” applies to both [qualities, telling us that in @ITall@it her years she possessed beauty and she was without sin]. (@ITR. Meir Stern@it) @p1@p2Just as when she was twenty she was not considered as having sinned . . .@p3 Question: Here, Rashi implies that right after turning twenty she was subject to [Heavenly] punishment. But regarding “Noach produced Sheim . . .” (5:32), Rashi said that before the Torah was given, people were not subject to [Heavenly] punishment until the age of one hundred? The answer is: Sarah was subject to punishment right after turning twenty because they accepted the Torah upon themselves—and after the Torah was given, people were subject to punishment from the age of twenty. Thus, Scripture is telling us that even by post-Torah standards, she was without sin. (@ITRe’m@it) "
Genesis 24:1," Since he had a son he needed to find a wife for him@p3. Otherwise, why does it say this here? The reason Scripture does not write outright [that he had a son] is to teach us that the son was considered like “all things.” Before he had a son, he said (15:2), “What will You give me since I continue to be childless?” But now all his blessings were complete. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) "
Genesis 25:1," Because her deeds were as beautiful as @HB קטורת@BO .@p3 But [the first explanation] raises a question: Why was she not named Ketores? Thus Rashi offers the [second] explanation: “Because she ‘tied her womb.’” And the second explanation raises a question: Why was she not named Keshurah, which means “tied” in Hebrew, instead of Keturah, which means “tied” in Aramaic? Therefore, Rashi offers the first explanation. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Did not mate with any man from . . . she separated from Avraham.@p3 [You might ask: Why were her deeds so beautiful?] Rashi explained above (21:14), “She returned to her family’s idolatry”! The answer is: She had in mind to return to idolatry because she thought, “Since I was rejected from the House of Avraham, his God has also left me.” But when she saw the miracle of the well for her son, and the angel revealing himself to her, she did not abandon Hashem.

Genesis 26:2," For you are a burnt-offering without blemish and being outside the [Holy] Land does not befit you.@p3 I.e., a burnt-offering is a @ITkodshei kodoshim@it sacrifice and may not be taken outside the Temple Courtyard. Similarly, the Land of Israel is your “Temple Courtyard”; you may not go outside the Land. "
Genesis 27:1," Because of the smoke of these.@p3 This follows its simple meaning: smoke is bad for the eyes. But Rivkah was used to it, as explained in the previous entry. It seems to me that all three reasons are needed, as follows. First Rashi explains that Yitzchok’s blindness was from the smoke, as Scripture juxtaposed it right afterward. But this raises the question: Why did Hashem bring this misfortune on him? [Rashi answers:] Perforce, Hashem did not save him from this cause [of blindness] so that Yaakov could receive the blessing. But a question remains: In any case, if there was smoke, why did not Rivkah, too, become blind? Thus Rashi explains that Yitzchok’s eyes were already weakened from the @ITakeidah@it, and the smoke caused him to lose his sight altogether. (@ITMaharshal@it) "
Genesis 28:2," Any word that requires a @HB ל@ee@BO prefix . . .@p3 It does not mean just any word, as we find this rule applies only to names of places and countries, such as @hh בבלה@ee and @hh חברונה@ee , and sometimes to vessels, such as @hh המזבחה@ee . "

Similarly with @hh ונאספו@ee and @hh וגללו@ee [in the next verse]; the future tense is used in place of the present tense, to convey that they would regularly gather and roll the stone. "
Genesis 30:1," She was envious of her good deeds.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because envy is [otherwise] forbidden. @p1@p2Did your father act this way to your mother.@p3 Rashi derives this from Yaakov’s answer: “Who has withheld @ITfrom you@it.” This implies, as Rashi says there, that Yaakov was saying: “You tell me to act as my father did. I am not like my father. It is from @ITyou@it that Hashem has withheld children, not from me,” implying that she had mentioned his father. @p1@p2From here, that one who has no children is considered as if dead.@p3 Otherwise, [if it meant that she is presently dying,] why did she ask for children? @hh מתה@ee is an adjective, not a present tense intransitive verb [conveying that she is dying]. And it is not a transitive verb [conveying that if Yaakov does not give her children, she will kill herself]. "
Genesis 31:3," And there I will be with you . . .@p3 This was not a stipulation: “If you return, I will be with you. And if not, I will not be with you.” Rather, Hashem was telling him the reason: Because here it is not possible [to rest My Divine Presence upon you]. @p1@p2It is not possible to rest My Divine Presence upon you@p3. “I will be with you” cannot mean, “To guard you on the way,” because Yaakov had already been promised this (28:15): “I am with you, and I will guard you wherever you go.” Rather it means, “There I will rest My Divine Presence upon you,” which necessarily includes the promise that he will not be killed on the way. This explains Rashi’s comment in Parshas Vayishlach (32:10): “You made two promises to me . . .” implying that when it says here, “I will be with you,” it means, “I will guard you on the way.” "
Genesis 32:3," Two camps—from outside Eretz Yisrael . . .@p3 Question: Rashi explained on, “Ascending and descending” (v. 28:12), that the two [groups of angels] were not together. Rather, one ascended and only then the other descended. [Why were both groups together here?] The answer is: Rashi explains at the beginning of Parshas Vayishlach that Yaakov sent actual angels [to Eisov]. Accordingly, it means as follows: Here too, the angels of outside Eretz Yisrael wanted to ascend before the angels of Eretz Yisrael would descend. But Yaakov forced them to stay because he wanted to send them to Eisov. If so, this implies that [the messengers sent by Yaakov] were actual angels. "
Genesis 33:4," There are those who explained these dots as saying that he did not kiss him wholeheartedly.@p3 Meaning: @hh וישקהו@ee has dots on all letters except the @hh ש@ee . Thus it is as if it is written @hh ויקהו@ee , as in @hh הקהה את שיניו@ee (blunt his teeth — Pesach Haggadah). This is because he intended to bite him. "
Genesis 34:7," For the gentiles constrained themselves from illicit relationships as a result of the Flood.@p3 And one who transgresses is sentenced to death. So did they accept upon themselves, as Rashi mentioned in Parshas Chayei Sarah [24:16]. Although this was beyond the requirement of the law [i.e., to be sentenced to death in a case where the woman is unmarried]. And so too, the expression @hh גדרו עצמן@ee implies: they constrained themselves, although Hashem did not command it. @ITNachalas Yaakov@it objected to this answer: The prohibition on unmarried women was merely a constraint and decree that the descendants of Noach [placed upon themselves. If so,] why was Shechem liable for death? The Rambam says because of robbery, and the Ramban says because of Shechem’s various evil deeds, [but no one says that he was liable to be executed for engaging in illicit relations]. And Rashi does not mention the above reasons because he is not seeking to explain why Shechem was liable for death, but to explain that “Such a thing should not be done” even with an unmarried woman. This raises the question of @ITRe’m@it: [“Is not an unmarried woman permitted to the descendants of Noach?”] to which Rashi answers, “For the gentiles constrained themselves . . ..” See there for elaboration. [An alternate approach:] You might ask: Is not an unmarried woman permitted to the descendants of Noach? The answer is: Since Shechem kidnapped her and thereby had relations with her, it is considered like illicit relations. Thus, he was liable to be executed. (@ITRe’m@it) "
Genesis 35:1," Because you lingered on your journey you have been punished . . .@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why did Hashem need to command him, “Arise, go up [to Beis Eil]”? Yaakov had already vowed to do this! Perforce, Hashem was telling him: Go up quickly and linger no longer. But Yaakov was not punished for lingering in Lavan’s house, because the vow went into effect only when he began to return [home]. For it is written [when he made his vow], “And if I return in peace . . .” (28:21). "
Genesis 36:2," In order to mislead his father.@p3 Question: Why did Eisov not call Bosmas, [too,] by a good name in order to trick his father? In Parshas Toldos (26:34), it should have mentioned that name, if she had it. The answer is: Eisov indeed called her by another, non-idolatry name. But [in Parshas Toldos], Scripture itself calls her Bosmas, denoting idolatry. This is because Scripture goes on to say (27:1), “Yitzchok’s eyesight faded and he could not see.” Rashi there explains that this was due to the smoke of these wives [who burned incense to idols]. And if Scripture would have called her by a different name there, we would ask: Where do we find [any hint] that they burned incense [to idols]? Thus Scripture calls her by the name of Bosmas (incense), to indicate this. See there. (@ITMaharshal@it) [You might ask]: Yehudis was the daughter of Be’eri the Chittite (26:34), while Oholivomoh was the daughter of Anoh the Chivite, [as it says here. How then could Rashi say that Yehudis and Oholivomoh are the same? The answer is:] Anoh and Be’eri is the same person with two names. Although Scripture connects him here to the Chivites and there to the Chittites, it is possible that his father was a Chittite, and his mother, a Chivite. You might ask: How does Rashi know that Yehudis is Oholivomoh? Perhaps Yehudis died, and Oholivomoh is another wife? @ITRe’m@it answers: Because it is written, “Eisov took his wives,” rather than, “Eisov took wives.” This implies they were the same wives who were mentioned before. "
Genesis 37:1," After it has written for you concerning the settlements of Eisov and his descendants. . .@p3 @ITRe’m@it explains that Rashi is answering the question: Why does Scripture not write first @hh ואלה תולדות יעקב. . .@ee , and then @hh וישב יעקב. . .@ee , which is the same format that it writes about Eisov. First Eisov’s descendants are enumerated (36:1) and then it tells where they had settled. Rashi answers: “After it has written for you concerning the @ITsettlements@it of Eisov and his descendants. . .” In other words, Scripture’s purpose is not to enumerate Yaakov’s descendants [as it did with Eisov], but only to explain the @ITsettlements@it of Yaakov and his descendants; and how they settled. [Thus, this section connects to the previous one as regards to settling,] as also the section about Eisov explained his settlement and that of his descendants. For it is written (36:8), “Eisov settled in Mount Seir,” explaining his settlement. Then it describes his descendants, “These are the descendants of Eisov. . .” and the descendants of his wives. Then it explains the settling of his sons (vs. 40-43), “These are the names of the chiefs of Eisov, each with their families, according to their places. . . These are the chiefs of Edom according to their places of residence.” Thus for Yaakov, too, Scripture tells about his settlements and that of his descendants, as it is written @hh וישב יעקב . . .@ee , which means, “Yaakov settled. . .” Then it is written @hh אלה תולדות יעקב . . .@ee , meaning: these are the @ITsettlements@it of the descendants of Yaakov, too, like [Scripture explained regarding] the descendants of Eisov. For at this point the Torah begins to recount what happened to them until they came there [to settle the Land]. It begins with “Yoseif at the age of 17,” then his being sold to Egypt and their enslavement there, then the Exodus — this and that happened to them until they came to settle the Land. "
Genesis 38:2," A merchant.@p3 You might ask: How does Rashi know that this term refers to a merchant? Perhaps Shua was an actual Canaanite. The answer is: Avraham did not want to give Yitzchok a Canaanite wife, and also Yitzchok commanded Yaakov not to marry one, so Yaakov’s sons surely would not [marry a Canaanite] either. But you might object: Rashi explained on 37:35, “R. Nechemiah says: ‘They [Yaakov’s daughters-in-law] were Canaanites,’” implying the sons did marry Canaanites. The answer is: Men from a different nation took Canaanite women and begat daughters, [whom Yaakov’s sons married], for these daughters were not [true] Canaanites because the lineage follows the father. But here it cannot be explained so, since it is written, “The daughter of a Canaanite @ITman@it,” implying that the @ITfather@it was Canaanite. "
Genesis 39:1," [Scripture now] returns to the earlier narrative, but only interrupted it. . .@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise [there is a question:] Is it not already written, “The Midianites sold him [in Egypt to Potiphar]” (37:36)? Perforce, Scripture “only interrupted it to relate. . .” (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1@p2Also, in order to relate the narrative of Potiphar’s wife to the narrative of Tamar. . .@p3 You might ask: Why did Rashi not explain this before, at the beginning of the section (38:1)? There, Rashi asks why Scripture interrupted to tell the narrative of Yehudah, and Rashi explains only that “his brothers demoted him,” but he did not bring this alternate explanation. The answer is: Before, one could have objected: how does Rashi know that Tamar had pure motives? But now that Rashi proves that her motive were pure, from the verse, “She is righteous, it is from me,” he therefore brings the explanation here. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) Question: According to the first explanation, Scripture should have only interrupted [by telling the narrative of Yehudah] until, “Many days passed . . . the wife of Yehudah died. . .” (38:12), where a different episode begins. Why did it not [return and] finish the narrative of Yoseif at that point? Rashi answers, “In order to connect the narrative of Potiphar’s wife to the narrative of Tamar.” But with this explanation only, [a question arises:] The narrative of Yehudah should begin with, “Many days passed . . . the wife of Yehudah died. . .” Why begin with, “Yehudah descended from his brothers” (38:1)? [The answer is:] Perforce, to indicate that they demoted Yehudah. Accordingly, at the beginning of the section Rashi is explaining only why “Yehudah descended from his brothers” follows after Yoseif’s sale. Thus he wrote only the first explanation. But here Rashi is explaining the reason for the @ITentire@it interruption, so he brings both explanations. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) "
Genesis 40:1," One, a fly was found in his cup. . .@p3 @hh פיילי@ee means cup in Aramaic. Then Rashi explains that in Greek, cup is @hh פוטירין@ee . @p1@p2A pebble was found in the bread of the other.@p3 You might ask: Perhaps it was the opposite? The answer is: It must have happened this way, because the other way a question arises — why was this one hanged, and the other, not? It is understandable if the fly was the butler’s. He was not hanged because it was beyond his control; he could not prevent a fly from suddenly falling into the cup. The baker, however, whose bread had a pebble, was negligent. He should have cleaned out the oven thoroughly, so that no pebble remained. "
Genesis 41:1," Every form of the word @HB קץ@BO means “the end.”@p3 It is obvious that @hh קץ@ee means “end,” as Onkelos translates it. However, [Rashi is answering the] question: Why does Scripture write the word @hh ימים@ee ? It would be understandable if @hh קץ@ee did not [always] mean “end,” but [also can mean] “some of,” as in @hh מ@hbקצ@hhה אחיו@ee , “From some of his brothers” (47:2). Accordingly, here it mentions @hh ימים@ee to indicate that it was two full years, not part of two years. But if @hh מקץ@ee always means “end,” why does Scripture write @hh ימים@ee ? Rashi answers: We might think @hh מקץ@ee means “some of,” and it @ITalways @itmeans this, unless it is evident otherwise from the verse. That is why it is written here @hh ימים@ee — to show that it means “end,” and not “some of.” Consequently, @hh קץ@ee @ITalways@it means “end.” For it is evident here that @hh קץ@ee means “end,” and we make a @ITgezeirah shavah@it between @hh קץ@ee [written here, and any other instance of] @hh קץ@ee . Thus Rashi says, “And [henceforth,] every form of the word @hh קץ@ee means ‘the end’.” So it seems to me, as opposed to @ITRe’m’s @itexplanation, that Rashi says every form of the word @hh קץ@ee means “the end” because Rashi wishes to distinguish @hh קץ@ee from @hh קצה@ee . This is because @hh קצה@ee sometimes means “end,” as in: “At the end (@hh מקצה@ee ) of three years” (Devarim 14:28). And it sometimes means “side,” as in: “One cherub on this side (@hh מקצה@ee )” (Shemos 25:19). And it sometimes means “some of,” as in: “From some of (@hh מקצה@ee ) his brothers” (47:2). Although [the word @hh קץ@ee ] appeared several times previously in Scripture, [and Rashi did not comment there,] this is not problematic, as many similar cases exist [where Rashi does not explain a word the first time it appears]. @ITRe’m@it writes: We need not object that it says, “At the @hh קץ@ee of seven years, you are to make @ITshemitah@it” (Devarim 15:1), which apparently means at the beginning of @ITshemitah@it, as it is written, “But in the seventh year you must let it rest” (Shemos 23:11). For [the answer is:] The verse in Devarim is speaking of releasing debts (@hh השמטת כספים@ee ), and this is at the end of @ITshemitah@it. @p1@p2All other rivers are not referred to as @HB יאורים@BO except for the Nile. . . @boRashi is answering the question: Why is it written @hb ה@hhיאור@ee , with a definite article? [The answer is:] Perforce it refers to the known @hh יאור@ee , mentioned earlier — the four @hh נהרות@ee written in Bereishis (2:11). Accordingly, why is it not written @hh נהר@ee here, like it does there? Surely [the answer is:] If it was written @hh נהר@ee here, we would not know which @hh נהר@ee , as four @hh נהרות@ee were mentioned earlier. Thus it says @hh יאור@ee , meaning the @hh נהר@ee that has @hh יאורים@ee . And all other @hh נהרות@ee are not called @hh יאורים@ee , only the Nile, as Rashi goes on to explain. The Nile is the Pishon River mentioned in Bereishis, as Rashi explains there. When Rashi says, “All other rivers,” he is referring to the other three @hh נהרות@ee written in Bereishis. @p1@p2The entire country is made up of man-made canals, and the Nile overflows. . .@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Since this verse is referring to one of the rivers mentioned in Bereishis, why is it not mentioned by its name? [The answer is:] Since Egypt is made up of man-made @hh יאורים@ee , its river [came to be] called @hh יאור@ee . But all other rivers [of other countries] are not made up in this manner. "
Genesis 42:1," Why do you show yourselves. . . as though you are satiated?”@p3 Meaning: If you show yourselves to them as being satiated and having grain, they will come and ask us for food, since they are our relatives. Therefore, go and buy food so they will think we have no food. But in fact they did have food at the time. Accordingly, @hh תתראו@ee means satiation. @p1@p2Similar to: @HB ומרוה גם הוא יורא@BO . The @hh א@ee of @hh תתר@hbא@hhו@ee replaces the @hh ו@ee of the root @hh ר–ו–ה@ee . There are many similar examples. The verse means: He who satisfies others with his learning in this world will himself be satisfied in the World to Come. You might ask: How is this proof for the last explanation, that @hh תתראו@ee is a term for leanness? On the contrary, it is a proof that it means satiation! The answer is: Rashi is bringing a proof for both explanations. For the first explanation, the plain meaning is a valid proof. And for the last explanation too it is a proof: @hh תתראו@ee is like @hh תתרוו@ee , but it means “not satiated.” This is similar to Rashi’s explanation of @hh הולך ערירי@ee (15:2) as “childless,” although @hh ער@ee means an heir, i.e., one who has sons. And it is also similar to what is written @hh ודשנו את המזבח@ee (Bamidbar 4:13), where Rashi explains: “They shall @ITtake away@it the ashes from the Altar,” although @hh דשן@ee means ashes. The same is true here. It is as if Scripture had written @hh תתרוו@ee since an @hh א@ee can be replaced by a @hh ו@ee , because the letters @hh א–ה–ו–י@ee are interchangeable. Thus @hh מרוה@ee , too, could mean “satiation,” yet will fit exactly with @hh תתראו@ee . Accordingly, the meaning of @hh ומרוה גם הוא יורא@ee is: He who is not satiated in this world will be satiated in the World to Come. "
Genesis 43:3," “You will not see me without your brother with you.”@p3 Rashi is answering the question: In all of Scripture, @hh בלתי@ee means “rather.” So why is it not written @hh בלתי @hbכאשר@hh אחיכם אתכם@ee (rather, you will see me @ITwhen@it your brother is with you)? Therefore Rashi says that here, @hh בלתי@ee means “without.” (@ITRe’m@it) [Rashi is saying] that we should not think it means, “You will not see me; rather, your brother alone will see me.” Thus he explains that it means: “You will not see me without your brother with you.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Explained the thing so that it fits, but was not meticulous to translate it literally.@p3 I.e., Onkelos translates @hh בלתי@ee as “rather,” and he adds @hh כד@ee , which means “that.” This is non-literal, because [if Onkelos is translating literally,] the word @hh כד@ee is added to the verse — and that is a forced explanation. "
Genesis 44:2," @HB גביע@BO is a tall goblet. . .@p3 Since it is written @hh גביע@ee twice, Rashi deduced that it means a @ITtall@it cup. We need not ask: Why was Yoseif not concerned they would [later] claim the goblet was theirs? Because [the answer is:] It was for divination, so surely it was [not theirs but] Yoseif’s. For it says, “There is no divination amongst Yaakov” (Bamidbar 23:23). (@ITauthor’s commentary@it) "
Genesis 45:1," He could not bear that the Egyptians standing by him. . .@p3 The verse means that Yoseif could not bear his brothers’ humiliation in front of all the people, so he said the people must leave. [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why did he have them leave? "
Genesis 46:1," A person must honor his father more than . . . his grandfather . . .@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did it not say, “To the God of his fathers”? Or, “To the God of Avraham,” who was the main one to spread knowledge of Hashem’s Presence? Whereas Yitzchok received [this knowledge] from Avraham. "
Genesis 47:2," But there is a reason for this. . .@p3 Which is: the entire forty years the Israelites were in the wilderness, Yehudah’s bones rattled in his coffin, [and Moshe prayed for him]. Rashi cites this on Devarim 33:7. "
Genesis 48:2," There are numerous such elliptical verses.@p3 Rashi does not explain here that the teller was Ephraim, as he explained above, since “he took his two sons with him” implies that Ephraim was with Yoseif and went with him to Yaakov. @p1@p2From here that we must honor royalty. . .@p3 [Rashi knows this] because Yoseif needed Yaakov [to bless his sons], yet Yaakov bowed to him nevertheless. But before (47:31), Rashi explained [the bowing differently:] “When it is the time of the fox, bow to him.” This is because Yaakov needed Yoseif [to swear to bury him]. @p1@p2And your servants will come down to me. . .@p3 Moshe knew that even Pharaoh would come down, as in fact happened. He said “your servants” [instead of “you”] to honor royalty. @p1@p2That one of my tribes is destined to be divided. . .@p3 I.e., the division into two is considered as two extra sons. "
Genesis 49:3," He had never had a nocturnal emission.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because @hh אוני@ee is redundant, for it is already written @hh כחי@ee , and @hh אוני@ee and @hh כחי@ee have the same meaning as Rashi explains. [Question:] A woman cannot conceive from her first act of relations. [So how could Reuvein the son of Leah, have been conceived from Yaakov’s first drop? The answer is:] Perhaps Leah had been deflowered by a piece of wood. @ITRe’m@it answers: She had deflowered herself with her finger. There are other answers; see there. @ITNachalas Yaakov@it writes: If not for what they wrote, I would explain that Leah did not actually conceive from the first drop. Rather, all of Yaakov’s drops were for [the purpose of conceiving] Reuvein, as Yaakov never had a nocturnal emission due to improper thoughts. See what he says there. "
Genesis 50:3," They completed the days of his embalming until forty days.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: [Why does it say @hh וימלאו@ee ?] The term @hh מלוי@ee (completion) applies only to a predetermined number, such as: “I will fill (@hh אמלא@ee ) the number of your days” (Shemos 23:26), meaning the number of days apportioned to you. Similarly (25:24): “When her days of pregnancy were completed (@hh וימלאו@ee ),” meaning the number of days apportioned for her pregnancy. There are many [other examples of this] in Scripture. But here, there was no predetermined number, so Rashi needed to add: “They completed the days @ITof his embalming@it.” Their period for embalming was for a predetermined number of forty days, as Rashi goes on to say. Rashi says @hh השלימו@ee instead of @hh וימלאו@ee , to teach that this @hh מילוי@ee denotes “completion,” rather than denoting “full” which is the opposite of empty. (@ITRe’m@it) @p1@p2Forty days of the embalming period and thirty for mourning. . .@p3 [Rashi explains] that the seventy days of mourning are not in addition to the forty days mentioned here. @p1@p2Because a blessing had come to them on account of him. . .@p3 [Rashi knows this] because otherwise, why did they weep? It could not have been to honor Yoseif, because a person cannot weep at will. "
