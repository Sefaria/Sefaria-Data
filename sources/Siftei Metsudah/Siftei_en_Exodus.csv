Exodus 2:1," Married her a second time.@p3 [The proof:] immediately after this marriage, Yocheved conceived and gave birth to Moshe. Yet, Aharon and Miriam were older than Moshe. Therefore, they were born from the first marriage of Amram and Yocheved’s first marriage. @d1She, too, became youthful again. @p3Since Yocheved is described as @hh בת@ee @hh לוי@ee (lit. “girl of Levi”), this implies she was youthful. "
Exodus 3:5," The place.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: @hh אדמת@ee (ground) is feminine, but @hh הוּא@ee [the pronoun ostensibly referring to it] is masculine. Therefore Rashi explains that @hh הוּא@ee refers to @hh המקום@ee (the place). "
Exodus 4:2," As a person who says to his friend. . .@p3 This does not contradict the Midrashic explanation [which preceded]. Rather, it explains why Hashem said: “What is that in your hand?” in the form of a question. For did Moshe not know what was in his hand? He surely saw it was a staff. "
Exodus 5:1," They received their retribution at Sinai: “Moshe, alone, drew near . . .”@p3 @ITRe”m @itwrote: “It is puzzling that Rashi here explains the verse from Shemos 24:2 as implying that ‘But they did not draw near’ refers only to the elders. This is not true, because the previous verse (24:1) states: ‘Ascend to Adonoy, you @ITand Aharon, Nadav, and Avihu@it, and seventy of the elders of Israel.’ Then is written, ‘Moshe, alone, drew near . . .’ Yet if Hashem turned everyone back as a punishment, what was Aharon’s sin? Similarly with Nadav and Avihu, who were not among the seventy elders. [What was their sin?]” @ITRe”m@it left the matter unresolved. But to me it seems not so problematic. For Rashi explains in Parashas Yisro (Shemos 19:24): “You [Moshe] will have your own designated area [when Hashem descends on Mt. Sinai], and also Aharon will have his own designated area, whereas the people may not break through their position at all.” Thus we see that the elders did not have their own designated area but stood among the people, and this was the punishment. And as for Nadav and Avihu, perhaps they stood in the same designated area as Aharon. (@ITKitzur Mizrachi@it) "
Exodus 6:1," To the kings of the seven nations when I will bring them (Yisrael) to the Land. @p3You might ask: It seems that Hashem is hinting @ITnow@it to Moshe that he will not enter the Land. Yet later, in Parshas Beha’alosecha (Bamidbar 10:29), and it says, “@ITWe@it are traveling to the place,” Rashi himself explained that Moshe thought he would enter the Land. The answer is: He thought he would enter but would die before conquering the seven nations, as B’nei Yisrael fought a long time before conquering them. But a difficulty remains, for earlier, it says, “Please send the one You usually send” (Shemos 4:13), and Rashi explained: “I [Moshe] am not destined to bring them into the Land.” Thus, it clearly implies that Moshe knew he would not enter the Land. The answer is: Moshe thought he would not bring them into the land as their leader, but would still enter as one of the people. But a difficulty still remains: Later on in Parshas Beshalach, it says, “@ITYou @itwill bring them and plant them on the mountain of Your inheritance” (Shemos 15:17), and Rashi explains: “Moshe prophesied that he would not enter the Land [at all].” The answer is: Moshe surely prophesied this, but not as a full prophecy, i.e., he prophesied without realizing the content of his prophecy. @d1Due to My strong hand . . .@p3 I.e., we should not explain that Pharaoh will let them go by @IThis@it strong hand, as in “The Egyptians pressed the people to hurry them” (Shemos 12:33), because this point is stated in the @ITend@it of our verse (“and by [a] strong hand, he will drive them out from his land”). @d1He will drive them out against their will.@p3 This seems to mean: Because of Hashem’s strong hand on Egypt, Pharaoh will drive the people out. But the @ITRe”m@it explains: Because of Pharaoh’s strong hand on the people, he will drive them out. However, his explanation is not correct. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) "
Exodus 7:2," As you heard it from Me. . .@p3 Rashi is explaining why it says, “@ITAll@it that I command you.” You (Moshe) will say each statement before Pharaoh, concisely and only once, just as you heard it from Me. And Aharon your brother will express each statement a few times, eloquently, until it is palatable to the ears of Pharaoh. (@ITMaharshal@it) "
Exodus 8:5," By asking something difficult and then saying. . .@p3 In other words, [see] if you can ask me to do something that I cannot do, then you can boast that I [was shown to be inferior because I] could not do it. @d1By when do you wish them destroyed. . .@p3 You might ask: What was Moshe asking him? Surely Pharaoh would like them destroyed immediately! The answer is that Moshe reasoned: if I pray to have them destroyed immediately, Pharaoh will be obligated to release Yisrael immediately, as promised to me (v. 4) — and this is bad for him. Thus Moshe did not know which Pharaoh prefered — [keeping Yisrael, or destroying the frogs]. An alternative answer is what the @ITRamban@it says, citing the @ITNaggid@it. @d1And not @HB אעתר עתרו@BO . . .@p3 [Rashi says as he does] because @hh אעתיר העתירו והעתרתי@ee is in the verbal form of @hh הפעיל@ee , which is transitive. However, our verse should use the [intransitive] form of @hh אפעל@ee , such as @hh אעתר עתרו ועתרתי@ee , since it is describing prayer, which is intransitive. Thus Rashi explains: “Because wherever a form of. . .” @d1So, too, does it say @HB אעתיר@BO . . .@p3 In other words, it is transitive because the direct object of the verb is “words”. [It is conjugated] as if “words” was actually written in the verse. @d1@HB והעתרתם@BO your words about me, meaning @BIyou have increased@BO.@p3 Rashi is saying that [here is the main proof] because it is written explicitly, “your words”. "
Exodus 9:8," Is thrown only with one hand. . .@p3 I do not know Rashi’s proof that Moshe threw [the furnace soot] with force. A possible answer: Here it is written @hh השמימה@ee , rather than @hh על השמים@ee as it is written about the plague of hail (v. 22). Apparently, Scripture changed the wording here to teach that Moshe sent up the soot unusually high, until the heavens. (see @ITRe’m@it) But it seems to me that [we need not find a proof for this, for] Rashi means to say the following: Anything that is thrown (@hh נזרק@ee ), is thrown with force. This is because @hh נזרק@ee implies with all of one’s force, which is with one hand. See Bereishis Rabba ch. 5 and Vayikra Rabba ch. 7. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) @d1Both his and Aharon’s handfuls.@p3 Rashi says this because it is written before, “Both of you take full handfuls.” [which is four handfuls in total]. @d1And another, that the soot spread over the entire land of Egypt.@p3 You might ask: Since [it spread so far only because] it was a miracle, why did Rashi explain that Moshe’s one fistful held both his and Aharon’s handfuls, [so that he could throw it with force]? [The miracle would be even greater if Moshe were to throw the soot with two hands and without any force and yet it travelled such a great distance.] Perhaps his fistful did not hold it, and Moshe threw with both hands [and it spread by a miracle]. The answer is: The miracle of its spreading over Egypt was not that it went farther than Moshe could throw, but that this small amount [of soot] covered the entire land of Egypt. [The fact that he was able to throw it with force because his fistful held both his and Aharon’s fistfuls does not pertain to this miracle. Rather, it is a miracle that stands on its own.] And according to what I explained above — that Rashi inferred from @hh השמימה@ee that Moshe threw with force — we may answer this question as well. Since @hh השמימה @ee implies with force, surely he threw with one hand, for he did not to rely on a miracle. "
Exodus 10:1," And warn him.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “@hh כי@ee (for) I have hardened his heart.” Every @hh כי@ee that appears in Scripture comes to give a reason for what preceded. And if “Go in to Pharaoh” did not mean “and warn him,” how would @hh כי@ee be giving a reason for what preceded? This is what Hashem was saying to Moshe: [It is true that] warning Pharaoh will surely have no effect, since he did not send out the B’nei Yisrael in spite of his confession, “This time I have sinned” (9:27). Thus our verse explains: “For I have hardened his heart @ITand the hearts of his servants@it.” In other words, the warning is necessary for his servants, whose hearts had not yet hardened [and they rebelled in the plague of hail only because Hashem hardened their hearts]. The reason Hashem did not harden their hearts sooner [but He waited for the plague of hail to do so] is that the verse states there, “he that feared the word of Hashem . . . made his servants and his livestock flee. . .” (9:20). If Hashem had not hardened the servants’ hearts at that time, they would have insisted that Pharaoh release the B’nei Yisrael. Thus He hardened their hearts, “So that I will be able to set these signs in their midst.” Although [with the coming plague of locusts] Pharaoh’s servants said, “Send the men out” (20:7), their repentance was not wholehearted [and they deserved the ensuing punishment]. For they said to send only the men [and not the entire nation], as Pharaoh himself said, “The [adult] men should go.” (20:11) (@ITNachalas Yaakov,@it see further elaboration there) @p1@p2That I will set.@p3 We need not ask: The same word, @hh שת@ee , is written in Parshas Vayeitzei: “@hh וישת@ee his own flocks. . .” (Bereishis 30:40), and in Parshas Va’eira: “Pharaoh . . . did not @hh שת@ee even to this” (@ITShemos @it7:23). Why did Rashi not comment there? The answer is: Here [the @ITshin@it of] @hh שתי@ee is vocalized with a @ITchirik@it and no @ITyud@it, so I might think it does not mean @hh שימי@ee but is a different word, such as, “For they destroyed the @hh שתות@ee (foundation)” (Tehillim 11:3). Or, “@hh שות שתו@ee (they did battle) at the gates” (Yeshayah 22:7). That is why Rashi needs to explain it here as @hh שימי@ee , although generally, the meaning is obvious. Even after explaining that @hh שתי@ee means @hh שימי@ee , Rashi explains further and says, “that I will set,” because @hh שתי@ee still has two possible meanings. This is similar to @hh תִּתִּי@ee , which has two possible meanings. One is written regarding Lavan, in Parshas Vayetzei (Bereishis 29:19): “Better @hh תִּתִּי@ee (@ITI@it shall give) her to you.” The other [possible] meaning is written in Parshas Balak (Bamidbar 22:13): “For Hashem has refused @hh לְתִתִּי@ee (to give @ITto me@it) permission to go with you.” Thus Rashi explains that here, @hh שתי@ee means “@ITI@it will set” [and not “set @ITfor me@it”]. (@ITRe”m@it) Alternatively: Rashi explains further and says, “that I will set,” because @hh שתי@ee could mean the past tense, “I already set.” Thus Rashi explains “I @ITwill@it set,” is in the future tense. "
Exodus 11:1," He will send you all away.@p3 [Rashi is explaining that @hh כלה@ee is] not from the word @hh כלייה@ee (destruction). Rather it is like @hh כליל תקטר@ee (Vayikra 6:15), which Onkelos translates as @hh גמירא@ee (@ITcompletely@it burnt). And there, @hh גמירא@ee cannot mean “destruction,” rather it means “completely.” "
Exodus 12:2," Moshe had difficulty regarding the renewal of the moon, how much of it must be visible so that it be fit to be consecrated.@p3 @ITRe”m@it cited and compared many sources but they are not connected. . . However, it seems clear to me that exceptional wisdom is needed in this matter. It says in Maseches Rosh Hashanah 20b: “Said R. Zeira said R. Nachman, ‘The new moon is invisible for twenty-four hours. For us [in Bavel], it is six from the old moon and eighteen from the new. For them [in Eretz Yisroel] it is six from the new and eighteen from the old.’” And this is the point over which Moshe had difficulty: is it six hours from the new, or is it eighteen from the new? (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) "
Exodus 13:2," That is the first to open the womb. . .@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Does not every infant open the womb [through its birth]? Thus he explains, “The @ITfirst@it to open. . .” @p1@p2I have acquired them for Myself. . .@bo Rashi is answering the question: Does not everything in the world belong to Him? Thus Rashi explains, “I have [already] acquired them for Myself.” I.e., every firstborn is holy even without your sanctifying it. Nevertheless, “Sanctify to Me all the first-born” in order to receive reward. "
Exodus 14:2," Is Pisom@BI. . .@bo@it [Rashi knows this] because the verse comes to tell us at which border they encamped, yet we do not know of Pi Hachiros, for it is not mentioned in Scripture. Thus, it must be Pisom. @p1@p2Because there they became free men. . .@p3 It is called Pisom, an acronym for “@ITPeh sasum@it” (sealed mouth). This is because an idol was there which did not allow any slave to escape. But now they became free men there, because Hashem altered Egypt’s ruling star in the heavens. So now [the place] was called Pi Hachiros, named after their attaining freedom (@ITcheirus@it). We need not ask: Why was it not now called Cheirus? And also, why was it not previously called Sasum@IT,@it rather than Pisom? For Rashi explains: “They were two high, upright rocks and the valley between them was like a mouth (@ITpeh@it).” @p1@p2It alone was left from all the gods of Egypt. . .@bo I.e., this god was left even though it is written, “Against all the gods of Egypt, I will execute judgments” (12:12). "
Exodus 15:1," @BIThen@BO, when Moshe saw. . .@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why did it not say @hh אז שר@ee (present tense)? @hh ישיר@ee is future tense, while @hh אז@ee is present tense, conveying: “then he sings.” Rashi answers: “Then, when Moshe saw the miracle, it entered his mind. . .” In other words, @hh ישיר@ee refers to his [present] thought to sing. @p1@p2And he did so: “And they said. . .”@p3 I.e., for right afterward it is written, “I will sing.” @p1@p2From here we derive an allusion that the resurrection of the dead. . .@p3 Meaning:@hh ישיר @ee implies at a future time. "
Exodus 16:1," Sixty one meals. . .@p3 There were sixteen days of Nisan and fifteen days of Iyar until the manna first descended. This makes sixty-two meals. However, they ate their first meal in Egypt on the night of the fifteenth, and went out that morning. @p1@p2Which was on the first day of the week. . .@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written, “Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day” from when it began to descend “is Shabbos, there will be none on that day” (16:26). @ITRe”m@it asks: Our verse shows that the fifteenth of Iyar, when they traveled from Eilim to the desert of Sin, was Shabbos. [For the manna started to fall the next morning, on Sunday]. But were they not commanded already at Marah to keep Shabbos [and certain other mitzvos? If so, how could they carry their possessions, and go beyond the Shabbos boundary? @ITRe”m@it] answers: Perhaps the fifteenth of the month mentioned in our verse is when they @ITarrived@it, but they actually journeyed on Friday the fourteenth. (See the @ITNachalas Yaakov @itregarding this.) "
Exodus 17:4," If I wait etc. . .@p3 Rashi adds, “@ITIf@it I wait,” because otherwise it implies they will surely stone him before long — whether or not he waits [to give them water]. "
Exodus 18:1," What news had he heard. . .@p3 that motivated him to come? (@ITRe”m@it) Question: Perhaps his coming was motivated equally by all the news, not by one incident more than another? The answer is: [One Tanna says that Yisro heard of the splitting of the Sea and thus came, and another says it was the war with Amaleik (Zevachim 116a).] According to the Tannaim, @hh וישמע יתרו@ee means Yisro heard [especially significant] news other than what the Torah mentions afterward, for otherwise the Torah should have stated @hh ויתרו שמע@ee . Accordingly, the phrase following @hh את כל אשר עשה@ee means: “@ITAnd@it he heard about all. . .” This is similar to @hh כי הוציא@ee , which [perforce] means: “@ITAnd@it that Hashem brought.” @ITRe”m@it asks: Why did Rashi omit the [third] opinion (in Zevachim 116a) that Yisro heard of the giving of the Torah, and thus came? @ITRe”m@it offers an answer, but it seems he overlooked the dispute in @ITZevachim@it 116a as to whether Yisro came before the Torah was given, or afterward. Since Rashi stated in many places that Yisro came after the Torah was given, [Rashi gave this opinion sufficient mention. Thus] he does not need to mention it here. (See @ITNachalas Yaakov.@it) [Alternatively, Rashi says it was the splitting of the Sea and the war of Amaleik] because he is answering the question: Why is it not written either: “Yisro saw,” as in “Balak saw” (Bamidbar 22:2), or: “Yisro knew”? Rashi answers: Because Yisro @ITheard@it about the splitting of the Sea and the war of Amaleik. They were one-time events, about which it cannot be said that “he saw” or “he knew.” For when Yisro came, he did not see that the Sea had split or that there had been a war with Amaleik. Now it is understandable why Rashi did not say Yisro “heard” about the manna, the well or the Torah. For [if it was referring to them] the Torah would have written, “Yisro saw,” since the manna, the well and the Torah were there for many years, and it could properly be said that he saw them. But this is not the case with the splitting of the Sea and the war of Amaleik. (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2He was called by seven names. . .@p3 However, in Bamidbar 10:29, Rashi mentions only two names, as it stated in the Sifrei. [It is Rashi’s way to cite differing Midrashim.] @p1@p2A letter was added to his name.@p3 @ITRe”m@it asks: If so, there are only six names! Before he converted he was called Yeser and not Yisro. After he converted he was called Yisro and not Yeser. They should not be considered as two names, just as Avram and Avraham should not be considered as two names. @ITRe”m@it leaves this question unanswered. But it seems to me not to be a question, for Rashi does not say, “He @IThas@it seven names.” He rather says, “He @ITwas called@it by seven names.” I.e., some names he was called before he converted, and some, afterward. (@ITMaharshal@it) Yet, it seems to me there is no proof that his name was [always] Yeser until he converted. Perhaps he [originally] had a different name. For Rashi also explained the verse, “Moshe went and returned to Yeser his father-in-law” (4:18), that Yisro was called seven names, just like Rashi explains here — but that was before Yisro converted and before he caused an additional @ITparsha@it in the Torah. Perforce, he had a different name before he converted, and there the Torah called him “Yeser” based on a future event. In truth, when he came and advised Moshe how to judge the people, he was immediately called [the new name of] Yeser, because he caused this additional @ITparsha@it in the Torah. And this occurred before he converted. After he converted, the letter @hh ו@ee was then added [to his name]. Thus, he was called seven names in addition to his original, nonJewish name. We need not object: In Parshas Shemos it said, “Moshe went and returned to @ITYeser@it, his father-in-law,” implying that his nonJewish name was Yeser. For this is no proof, as it is also written there, “Moshe tended the sheep of his father-in-law @ITYisro”@it (3:1),” [though Yisro had not yet converted]. Perforce, [he was called Yeser and Yisro] based on a future event, as I explained. (@ITAuthor’s commentary@it) @p1@p2Chovov is Yisro. . .@p3 [Rashi says this] so we will not think Chovov was Yisro’s son. And Rashi clearly explains so on v. 13, [that we should not think this]. @p1@p2Others say that Re’uel was Yisro’s father. . .@p3 Question: If so, Yisro would have only six names! The answer is: [Here,] Rashi is explaining according to the Mechilta [read: Sifrei] which says that he only had two names, Chovov and Yisro. Assumedly, the Mechilta [read: Sifrei] holds that he was called also Yeser, for it is written: “Moshe went and returned to @ITYeser@it his father-in-law.” This is because the Mechilta [read: Sifrei] holds that Yeser and Yisro are actually the same name, similar to Avram and Avraham. [Accordingly, Rashi is answering the] question: It is written, “They (Yisro’s daughters) came to their father Re’uel” (2:18). Does this not imply that Yisro was also called Re’uel, [giving him more than two names]? The other names do not pose a difficulty, for they could be family names, as the Torah does not say “their father” regarding them. But “Re’uel” poses a difficulty. Therefore [to resolve this difficulty] Rashi explains: “Others say that Re’uel was Yisro’s father.” (@ITMaharshal@it) @p1@p2Here Yisro prides himself with Moshe. . .@p3 [Taken on its own,] there is no difference between @hh וישמע יתרו חותן משה@ee and @hh וישב משה אל יתר חותנו@ee . In both cases, the Torah identifies Yisro by means of Moshe, not the other way around. This is because @hh חותנו@ee (“his father-in-law) means the same as @hh חותן משה@ee (“Moshe’s father-inlaw”). But the context makes a difference. [In the latter verse,] the subject of the story is Moshe, and Yisro is mentioned as “his father-inlaw.” Thus the story implied that Moshe is priding himself [with Yisro. In the former verse,] the story’s subject is Yisro, and Yisro is mentioned as “Moshe’s father-in-law.” Thus it is implied that Yisro is priding himself [with Moshe]. @p1@p2Moshe is equal to all of Yisrael.@bo [Rashi knows this] because otherwise it should say only “Yisrael,” for this would also include Moshe. Perforce, it comes to teach that Moshe is equal. Why does Rashi’s commentary not follow the order of the verse? [I.e., he first explains, “For Moshe and Yisrael,” and then, “About all that Elohim had done.”] It is because Rashi is answering the question: “All that Elohim had done” surely [seems to] refer to, “Hashem brought Yisrael out of Egypt.” But [if it is really] referring to this, why [does it say, “For @ITMoshe@it and Yisrael”? The phrase should place Yisrael before Moshe, because Yisrael was enslaved, but Moshe and his tribe were not, as Rashi explained in 5:4. But if Moshe is greater than all of Yisrael, it would be logical [to place Moshe first]. But being that Moshe was equal but not greater, Yisrael should have come first, since the main reason for the Exodus was for them [and the question remains unresolved]. Neither can we answer that Moshe is placed first in order to teach that he was @ITequal@it to all of Yisrael. For this is learned from the mere fact that Moshe is mentioned separately, as I explained at the beginning. Thus, Rashi answers as follows: “All that Elohim had done” does @ITnot@it refer to Hashem’s bringing them out of Egypt. It rather refers to the manna, [the well and the war of Amaleik, as Rashi states in the next entry]. These acts of goodness benefited both Moshe and Yisrael equally. And since Hashem performed these acts mainly for Moshe, he is mentioned first. Hashem brought the manna and the well in order to save Moshe from Yisrael’s complaints against him. And Moshe, who was the king of Yisrael, defeated Amaleik by his prayer and by confusing the hours for Amaleik as it says in the Midrash (see Rashi on 17:12). [This answers the original question: Why does Rashi’s commentary not follow the order of the verse? The answer is that Rashi first explained “For Moshe and Yisrael” because it is the key to understanding “About all that Elohim had done.” Since Moshe is placed before Yisrael, “All that Elohim had done” cannot refer to Hashem’s bringing them out of Egypt.] @p1@p2For them. . .@p3 [You might ask:] Why does Rashi write, “For them,” instead of saying, “For Moshe and for His people Yisrael”? [The answer is: It is simply] for the sake of brevity. Similarly, Rashi says on 6:3, “To the fathers,” instead of saying, “To Avraham, to Yitzchok and to Yaakov.” (@ITRe”m@it) [An alternative answer:] So we will not think Hashem did some miracles for Moshe alone, and some for Yisrael alone. Therefore Rashi says, “For them,” to group them together. What he did for one, he did for the other. (@ITGur Aryeh@it) @p1@p2This being the greatest of them all.@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Why was bringing them out of Egypt mentioned separately? Perforce, it is to tell us that it was “the greatest of them all.” For it says, “@ITAll@it that Elohim had done,” and concludes with, “That Hashem brought Yisrael out.” This implies that Hashem did other miracles as well, [besides bringing them out]. Otherwise, why does it says, “All”? "
Exodus 19:1," The first day of the month. . .@bo [Rashi knows this] because here it is written, @hh ביום הזה@ee , and there (12:2) it is written @hh החודש הזה@ee . There it means the first day of the month, so here too it means the first day of the month. @p1@p2Why is @HB ביום הזה@BO written. . .@p3 [Question: Since @hh ביום הזה@ee is needed to teach that it is the first of the month, how can it also teach that words of Torah should be as new to you (as though they were given today)? The answer is:] In the Mechilta it says, “‘On that very day they came to the desert of Sinai.’ This was on the first of the month. Thus it is written, ‘In the third month.’” It seems the Mechilta means as follows: the intent of the verse is not to conceal, but to explain. Yet it says @hh בחדש השלישי . . . ביום הזה@ee , not stating which day it was. Perforce, it means the first of the month. This is because the first of the month is called @hh חודש@ee , as in (Shmuel I, 20:18): “Tomorrow is the @hh חודש@ee (first of the month),” and as in (Melachim II, 4:23): “It is neither the @hh חודש@ee (first of the month) nor Shabbos.” So when it says @hh ב@hbחודש@hh השלישי@ee , [we understand that it was the first of the month]. Accordingly, Rashi asks: Why did it not say @hh ביום ההוא@ee ? Even without the @ITgezeirah shavah@it [between @hh ביום הזה@ee and @hh החודש הזה@ee , see previous entry,] we still would learn from @hh ב@hbחודש@hh השלישי@ee that it was the first of the month. Perforce, it says @hh ביום הזה@ee to teach that words of Torah should be as new to you (as though they were given today). This answers @ITRe”m@it’s questions. (@ITNachalas Yaakov@it) "

This implies that only “I am Hashem” and “You must not have” were said in one utterance, but actually all of them were said in one utterance.

The rest were repeated by Moshe. @p1@p2“Yes” to a positive command. . .@p3 Rashi is answering the question: Wherever @hh וידבר@ee is written it always speaks in general, while @hh לאמר@ee introduces the specifics.

Exodus 21:1," It disqualifies that which preceded it.@p3 If you say: [This rule seems not true because] in Parshas Bechukosai (Vayikra 27:34) it is written, “@hh אלה@ee (These) are the commandments.” And in Parshas Masei (Bamidbar 36:13) it says, “@hh אלה@ee (These) are the commandments and the laws.” And in Parshas Matos (ibid 30:17) it says, “@hh אלה@ee (These) are the statutes.” And in Parshas Ki Savo (Devarim 28:69) it is written, “@hh אלה@ee (These) are the words of the covenant.” And in all theses cases we do not interpret it as disqualifying that which preceded. The answer is: We only interpret it this way for “@hh אלה@ee (These) are the histories of the heaven and the earth” (Bereishis 2:4; see Shemos Rabba 30:3), where the histories were already mentioned above, so a difficulty arose: why are they repeated and detailed? Similarly for “@hh אלה@ee (These) are the descendants of Noach” (Bereishis 6:9), where the descendants were mentioned above in Parshas Bereishis, so a difficulty arose: why were they mentioned again? Thus we say they were mentioned again in order to disqualify the preceding. [The meaning of “disqualify” is discussed in the next entry.] But with “@hh אלה@ee (These) are the commandments” and all the above verses, nothing was mentioned [preceding them that was similar to them], so @hh אלה@ee cannot mean to disqualify the preceding. Similarly in Parshas Devarim, where it says “@hh אלה@ee (These) are the words” (Devarim 1:1), we cannot interpret @hh אלה@ee as disqualifying the preceding, since Chumash Devarim is @ITMishneh Torah@it [i.e., its primary purpose is a repetition of the Torah]. @d1Then why was the section of judgments placed near the section dealing with the Altar?@p3 Many difficulties arise. First, Rashi should have asked this [first, as his first comment] on the verse, “And these are the laws. . .” Second, perhaps [the Torah is just following] the order that these Torah sections were told by Hashem to Moshe. Third, Rashi explained straightforwardly at the beginning of Parshas Behar that the entire Torah was said by Hashem at Sinai. [So why does our verse connect only the judgments to Sinai?] Fourth, Rashi [earlier] should have said that the @hh ו@ee of @hh ואלה@ee “is a continuation of that which preceded it.” [I.e., why does Rashi need the whole word of @hh ואלה@ee to teach this?[ Fifth, Rashi should have explained this rule on the verse “@hh אלה@ee (These) are the products of the heaven and the earth” (Bereishis 2:4), or “@hh אלה@ee (These) are the descendants of Noach” (ibid 6:9). The answer is: The rule that @hh אלה@ee disqualifies (@hh פסל@ee ) that which preceded it, means [that it @ITminimizes@it that which preceded it. I.e.,] these things now to be mentioned are better and more important than those preceding things which are less significant. That is the meaning of @hh פסל@ee . So did Bereishis Rabba explain “@hh אלה@ee (These) are the products of the heaven and the earth,” and “@hh אלה@ee (These) are the descendants of Noach.” Here too, if the Torah had written @hh אלה@ee , I would think it is disqualifying [i.e., minimizing] the judgments, [since it cannot be minimizing the preceding — the Ten Commandments — which were on the highest level]. But now that the Torah wrote @hb ו@hhאלה@ee , it means “a continuation of that which preceded it,” saying that the judgements, too, were given in the assembly of all B’nei Yisrael, with thunder and lightning, like the Ten Commandments that preceded them. Whereas the other mitzvos were given to Moshe alone, during his forty days on the mountain. Therefore Rashi asks: “Why was the section of judgments placed near the section dealing with the Altar?” Since the section of judgments is a continuation of the Ten Commandments, why does the section dealing with the Altar interrupt them? So explained the @ITRe’m@it at length. @d1Do not allow it to enter your mind to say, I will teach them. . .@p3 [Rashi knows this] because for most mitzvos the Torah says, “@ITSpeak@it to the B’nei Yisrael and @ITsay@it to them,” [or similar expressions]. Thus [the repetition of] “speak” and “say” implies teaching them at least twice. If so, why did Hashem now use the [unusual] expression of “set before them”? We must say it means “to make them understand the reasons for each thing.” (@ITRe’m@it) @d1And not before the gentiles.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because “before @ITthem@it” refers to the seventy elders mentioned above in Parshas Yisro, who ascended the mountain with Moshe before the giving of the Torah. This is Rashi’s approach, as stated in the first chapter of Maseches Gittin. Tosafos explained that “before @ITthem@it” refers to the judges mentioned in a future verse: “The claims of both parties must be brought to the @ITjudges@it” (22:8). But according to both views, it refers to expert judges and not laymen judges. Thus you might ask that “before them” could be teaching us: “and not before laymen judges,” and certainly not before the gentiles. The answer is: Rashi himself answered this question when he explained, “And even if you know of a particular law that they render the same as Jewish law, do not bring the matter to their courts.” Rashi is saying that the Torah excluded gentile judges absolutely, even if they rule the same as Jews. But [this exclusion could not apply to laymen judges,] since one is indeed allowed to have them judge if they know a particular law as well as the experts do. "
Exodus 22:1," He was actually in the act of breaking in.@p3 This is as opposed to explaining: the thief was found in the @ITplace@it of breaking in. [That cannot be the meaning,] because “breaking in” is not a place, about which we could say that the thief was “found” there. Therefore, Rashi explains that he was found “in the act” of breaking in. "
Exodus 23:1," You promise him that you will be a corrupt witness.@p3 [The case is that] the claimant already has one false witness [to support his claim]. And the verse is warning this [potential second] witness: Do not join with that false witness, who is “a wicked man.” "
Exodus 24:1," On the 4th of Sivan. . .@p3 [Rashi knows this] because afterwards it is written (v. 3), “Moshe came and told the people. . .” and Rashi explains that Moshe told it to them on that same day. [And that verse goes on to say that Moshe told them] “all the words of Adonoy.” And Rashi explains that this is the command to separate from their wives. And Rashi explained earlier, in Parshas Yisro (19:9—10), that the mitzvah of separation was on the 4th of Sivan. "
Exodus 25:2," @hb לי@hh@ee@BO means for the sake of My Name.@p3 Everything in the world is His, [therefore it cannot mean, “so it will be Mine.”] @d1Setting aside.@d2 Rashi is explaining that here it does not mean “lifting up,” as it does in (29:27): “The shoulder of the @ITterumah@it-offering.” (@ITRe”m@it) @d1Let them set aside from their possessions a donation.@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Since @ITterumah@it here means “setting aside,” why does it not have a fixed amount, like @ITterumah@it taken from grain and wine? Therefore Rashi explains that it is “from their possessions,” [not from their fields,] so it has no fixed amount. Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: If @ITterumah@it here means “setting aside,” why does the verse not state first @ITwhat@it they are to set aside, and then write, “Have them take for Me a @ITterumah@it-offering”? Thus Rashi adds the words, “From their possessions.” [This answers also a second] question: Does the verse not imply that the @ITterumah@it should come from their very selves, as it is written, “A @ITterumah@it-offering from every man”? Therefore Rashi explains, “Let them set aside from @ITtheir possessions@it a donation.” This answers everything. “Have them take for Me a @ITterumah@it-offering” indeed means “set aside,” as Rashi said, “Let them @ITset aside@it from their possessions.” And we need not say that the @ITterumah@it comes from their very selves, because it comes from their possessions. Accordingly, “From every man” is not to be read with the preceding phrase, “@ITterumah@it-offering,” but with the phrase following “Whose heart impels him.” And since we might think that this setting aside is obligatory, Rashi tells us that it is a good-will donation, as implied by, “Whose heart impels him to generosity.” (@ITRe”m@it) @d1The same root as @hb נדבה@BO . . .@d2 It is as if it said @hh י@hbנ@hhדבנו@ee , for the @hh נ@ee is represented by the @ITdagesh@it of the @hh ד@ee . @d1The expression @hb תרומה@BO is mentioned here three times. . .@d2 However, Scripture explains here only the @IT“terumah@itoffering for the@IT mishkon@it — the donation of each individual.” Otherwise, [if it does not allude to three different @ITterumah@it-offerings,] why does it say @hh תרומתי@ee and @hh וזאת התרומה@ee ? Scripture should have written: @hh ויקחו לי תרומה מאת כל איש אשר ידבנו לבו זהב וכסף ונחשת@ee . @d1The thirteen items mentioned. . .@d2 [Question: Are there not fifteen items listed here? The answer is:] Greenish-blue, dark red and crimson are all of wool, just with different dyes [so they count as one]. Another answer: The onyx stones and filling stones were brought by the leaders of the tribes, while Rashi is counting what the public donated. "
Exodus 26:1," Thus you have four kinds [of material] together in each and every thread. . .@d2 Explanation: all were entwined [into one thick thread], for it is written, “Twined.” The @hh ו@ee of @hh ותכלת@ee has the meaning of @hh ב@ee . Thus the verse conveys: “Fine linen entwined @ITwith@it greenish blue, dark red, and crimson.” It is like the @hh ו@ee in @hh ה' שלחני @hbו@hhרוחו@ee (Yeshaya 48:16), which means: “Hashem sent me @ITwith@it His spirit.” Similarly,@hh ה' @hbו@hhכלי זעמו @ee (ibid. 13:5), which means: “Hashem @ITwith@it His weapons of wrath.” @d1Which is done through needlework. . .@d2 In which the image appearing on both sides is the same. @ee@BOA lion on this side and an eagle on the other side.@bo @ITRe”m@it writes: “According to [what Rashi wrote on Yoma 72b], it does not mean specifically ‘a lion on this side and an eagle on the other side.’ It just means various images. . . However, I do not know why the verse calls these various images ‘cherubim,’ if ‘cherubim’ means images of children. Onkelos translates @hh כרובים@ee as @hh כרביא@ee , [‘like children,’] and so Rashi wrote on 25:28, and so it says in Chagigah 13b.” But it seems to me that the @ITmishkon’s@it drapes had only the four images of the Heavenly Chariot: man, lion, ox and eagle, [all of which are referred to as “cherubim”; see Yechezkel 10:20.] Rashi meant specifically “a lion on this side and an eagle on the other side.” "
Exodus 27:1," It states concerning the inner [altar]: “square”. . .@d2 [This interpretation is made] because the word “square” in both places is [extra and is therefore] available for a @ITgezeirah shavah.@it For it is written here, “Five @ITamohs@it long, and five @ITamohs@it wide,” so why does it also say, “Square”? This shows the word is available [for a @ITgezeirah shavah@it]. And it is available there as well. For it is written (30:2), “It shall be one @ITamoh@it long and one @ITamoh@it wide,” so why does it also say, “Square”? This shows that it too is available [for a @ITgezeirah shavah@it]. Since the word is available for a @ITgezeirah shavah@it on both sides, it may be interpreted even contrary to the verse’s plain meaning. "
Exodus 28:1," After the work of the @BImishkon @BOis completed.@d2 But not now. [Rashi knows this] because they were taken [as @ITkohanim@it] only by means of the garments and the @ITmishkon,@it as it is written (v. 4): “Make sacred garments for your brother Aharon. . .” [See Rashi on v. 3.] (@ITRe”m@it) "
Exodus 29:1," They are of two different @HB גִזְרוֹת@BO . . .@d2 I.e., two different word roots. One is @hh קיחה@ee and the other is @hh לקיחה@ee . @d1To atone for the act of the calf. . .@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Why is a bull taken, and not another type of animal? [Rashi answers as he does] because “bull” means the same as “calf” whenever it is not written “less than a year old” [for the calf. Question: How can a bull be used for this purpose?] An accuser cannot become a defender. @ITRe”m@it answers: That rule applies only to service done inside [the @ITohel moed@it], not to service done outside [in its courtyard]. Later, in @ITparshas@it Tzav, I will explain this further, God willing. "
Exodus 30:1," To raise up on it burning. . .@d2 [Rashi knows this] because it does not say @hh מזבַח@ee as it does with @hh מזבַּח העולה@ee (38:1). Consequently, @hh מזבֵּחַ@ee is not connected with @hh מקטר קטרת@ee . It can connect only if we add the word @hh להעלות@ee (to raise up), so that it conveys: “An altar which is in order to raise up on it burning incense.” This is as Rashi explains: “Burning — smoke of incense.” "
Exodus 31:2, To do My work. . .@d2 Rashi is answering the question: Why does it not say @hh קראתי שם לבצלאל@ee — “I gave a name to Betzalel”? Therefore he explains that it means: “I have called [someone] by name to do My work.” And whom did I call? Betzalel. 
Exodus 32:1," Six hours have already come. . .@d2 I.e., the word @hh בשש@ee connotes @hh באו שש@ee (six have come). @d1And taught us the way. . .@d2 Rashi is answering the question: First it is written @hh עשה לנו אלהים אשר @hhילכו@hh לפנינו@ee . Accordingly, it should then say @hh כי זה משה האיש ש@hhהלך@ee . This way it would convey: “Moshe, the man who once went before us, has now died. Therefore, make us gods who will go before us.” Why is it written @hh אשר העלנו מארץ מצרים@ee ? Therefore Rashi explains that @hh אשר העלנו מארץ מצרים@ee is not to be understood literally; rather it means that Moshe taught us the way to go. "
Exodus 33:3," Do I tell you to bring them up.@d2 [Rashi is explaining] that this connects to v. 1: “Leave, go up from this. . . to the land of which I swore.” It does not connect to what immediately precedes, [for then it would convey:] “And I will drive out the Canaanites. . . to a land flowing with milk and honey.” @d1For this reason I say to you. . .@d2 I.e., this gives the reason for (32:34), “Behold, My angel will go before you.” It is because, “I will not go up among you. . . I may destroy you.” This does not connect to what immediately precedes, rather to (v. 1): “Leave, go up from this.” @d1And you are rebellious against Me. . .@d2 [Question:] It is written in 34:9, “Let my Master go among us, for (@hh כי@ee ) it is a stiff-necked people.” Does this not show the contrary to be true, that being stiff-necked makes it fitting for God to go among them, thereby contradicting what it says here? [The answer is:] Rashi already resolved this by explaining that the @hh כי@ee written there means “if,” conveying: “Since You bear iniquity. . . @ITif@it they will be a stiff-necked people and rebel against You. . . You will forgive our iniquity.” (@ITRe”m@it) "
Exodus 34:2," Prepared.@d2 As in, “Send portions of food to he who has nothing prepared (@hh נכון@ee ) for him” (Nechemiah 8:10). As opposed to its [other] meaning, “correct,” as in: “If in fact the report is true and correct (@hh נכון@ee )” (Devarim 13:15). "
Exodus 35:1," On the day following Yom Kippur.@p3 [Rashi knows this] because it is written above, “When Moshe came down from Mount Sinai” (33:29), and that was on Yom Kippur. And this verse relates back to that event, because [when the Torah finishes the account of Moshe’s coming down, immediately] afterwards it is written, “Moshe assembled. . .” Thus we see it was the day following Yom Kippur. (@ITRe”m@it) Furthermore, the assembly was mainly for donating toward the work of the @ITmishkon@it so that the donated gold should atone for the gold given for the Calf. Therefore, we may assume it happened immediately after Moshe came down from the mountain, in order to atone right away for the incident of the Calf, and so that Hashem’s anger against Yisrael should be removed. See 31:18 [Rashi there]: [“On Yom Kippur, God reconciled Himself to Yisrael. The next day they began donating to the @ITmishkon@it.”] You might ask: How did Moshe have time to assemble them and tell them to donate to the @ITmishkon@it? The day after Yom Kippur he sat to judge the people all day, as it says: “On the following day Moshe sat to judge . . . from morning until evening” (18:13). And Rashi there explains, “It was the day following Yom Kippur,” and goes on to prove it. The answer is: Rashi there answers it himself by saying that “From morning until evening” [is not to be understood literally. Rather, it] is to teach us that “every judge who judges correctly and truthfully is . . . as if he were involved in Torah study the entire day. . .” @d1It (@HB ויקהל@BO ) is in the causative form. . .@p3 Explanation: Rashi’s main proof is that it is vowelized @hh וַ@hbיַּ@hhקְהֵל@ee rather than @hh וַ@hbיִּ@hhקְהַל@ee . The @ITpasach@it indicates the causative form, as in @hh וַ@hbיַּ@hhסַּע משה את העם@ee (15:22), and @hh אשר המה @hbמַ@hhלִינִים@ee (Bamidbar 14:27), which are also in the causative form. @d1The correct version of this in Onkelos is: @HB ואכניש@BO .@p3 @ITRe”m@it writes: “I do not understand what Rashi means by this.” @ITNachalas Yaakov@it writes: It seems to me that Rashi wrote this because he saw two versions of Onkelos. Therefore he proves that the correct version is [the causative form] @hh ואכניש@ee , not @hh וכנש@ee . Similarly in Bamidbar 16:19, @hh וַיַקְהֵל עליהם קרח@ee , Onkelos writes @hh ואכניש@ee . But in Bamidbar 20:10, @hh וַיַּקְהִילוּ . . . אל פני הסלע@ee , Targum Onkelos and Targum Yonasan both say @hh וכנשו@ee . "
Exodus 36:5," More than is. . .@p3 The @hh מ@ee [of @hb מ@hhדי@ee ] means “more than,” as in (Bereishis 29:30), “He loved Rochel more than Leah (@hb מ@hhלאה@ee ).” Rashi adds the phrase, “What was needed for,” because the people brought only what was needed for the work, not the [completed] work itself. "
Exodus 37:1," Because he extended himself for the work . . .@p3 I.e., throughout the section it is written, “He made,” but it is not written “Betzalel” as it does about the ark. This is because they [the other items] do not have as much sanctity as the ark, so Betzalel did not wish to exert himself as much in making them. Instead, Betzalel showed Oholiav and the other disciples [what to do], and they made them. But the ark possessed great sanctity, so Betzalel personally exerted himself over it and extended himself more for the work. @d1Their purpose is to incite the evil inclination . . .@p3 You might ask: The @hh כומז@ee , which is in the shape of the woman’s private parts, is even more repulsive. [Yet, Moshe readily accepted the @hh כומז@ee .] Why did Moshe not find it repulsive? The answer is: About the @hh כומז@ee it is written that the women brought it together with bracelets, nose-rings and fingerrings. Then it was all melted down together by fire, and the @hh כומז@ee became nullified among them. Here, however, they did not bring any copper other than the mirrors. An alternative answer: The @hh כומז@ee is for nullifying the evil inclination. I.e., it [guards the private parts and] prevents from coming to lewdness. But the mirrors facilitate lewdness, so Moshe found them repulsive. @d1God said to him: Accept.@p3 Meaning: you should accept them. @d1Entice him (@HB ומשדלתו@BO ) with words. @bo@hh ומשדלתו@ee means verbal seducement, for Onkelos translates (22:15) @hh כי יפתה@ee [as @hh ארי ישדל@ee .] @d1That is the intent of what is said: “By the mirrors of the @HB צובאות@BO ” . . .@p3 I.e., @hh הצובאות@ee comes from @hh צבאות@ee (hosts). @hh במראות הצובאות@ee conveys: with the mirrors from which very many hosts came. @d1Whose husband expressed jealousy and she nevertheless concealed herself . . .@p3 I.e., he who expresses jealousy to his wife then tests her with these cursing waters, as written in Bamidbar 5:17. @d1Onkelos also translates it this way: @HB במחזית@BO of the women . . .@p3 I.e., also Onkelos translates @hh מראות@ee to mean mirrors used by women for adorning themselves. For he translates @hh והגליונים@ee as @hh מחזייתא@ee , and @hh והגליונים@ee are surely mirrors used by women for adorning themselves. @d1To bring their contribution.@p3 Rashi means as follows: the word @hh צבאו@ee comes from @hh צבא@ee (host). I.e., people gathering together. And [this raises the question:] why did he gather them together? Thus Rashi explains: to bring their contribution to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. "
Exodus 38:28," The splendid turbans.@p3 Rashi needed to explain this so we will not mistakenly think that @hh פארי@ee means as it does in, “He will cut the branches (@hh פארה@ee ) with terror” (@ITYeshaya @it10:33). Thus Rashi explains that it means, “The splendor of the turbans.” @hh פארי@ee is the plural of @hh פאר@ee , and means the same as @hh פארים@ee (splendors). Rashi says, “The splendid turbans,” because if the turbans were not splendid, there would not be any @hh פארים@ee [at all, since @hh פארים@ee is not an object that stands on its own] — and in that case it would not say @hh פארי המגבעות@ee . "
Exodus 39:29," Moshe performed the service . . .@p3 [Accordingly,] when it is written here, “He burned the incense of spices upon it” (v. 27), it refers to Moshe, who burnt the incense during the seven days of the Installations before Aharon was anointed. And even on the eighth day, when Aharon began to burn incense, Moshe still burnt the incense [and brought the offerings] except for those which Aharon was commanded specifically for that day. Aharon and his sons brought [only] the offerings that they were commanded specifically for that day. @d1The daily burnt-offering.@p3 This, as opposed to the burnt-offering of Aharon and the burnt-offering of the people, which, on the eighth day, were offered by Aharon — not Moshe — as stated in @ITparshas@it Shemini. @d1The @BImincha@BO of the libations of the @BItamid @BO. . .@p3 [Rashi knows this because] even though there are many [kinds of] meal-offerings, nevertheless since it is written, “And a meal-offering,” without specifying it further, it is speaking of the @ITmincha@it of the @ITtamid@it. If it was a @ITmincha@it that comes separately, it should be mentioned separately, [i.e., by name], since it is not subsidiary to another offering. Perforce, it is speaking of the @ITmincha@it of the @ITtamid,@it which is part of the @ITtamid@it burnt-offering as it says (Bamidbar 28:4—5), “Offer one lamb in the morning . . . and one tenth of an @ITeiphah@it of fine flour as a meal-offering . . .” @d1Their encampment is also called @HB מסע@BO . . .@p3 Rashi is answering the question: While Yisrael traveled, the cloud did not rest. Rather, B’nei Yisrael encamped only when the cloud rested, and in that place. Why does the verse say, “In all their travels,” implying that the cloud rested even while they traveled? Rashi answers, “Their encampment is also calle @hh מסע@ee .” Accordingly, the verse conveys, “In all their @ITencampments@it.” It does not mean literally, “In all their @ITtravels@it,” because then the cloud was not upon the @ITmishkon.@it "
