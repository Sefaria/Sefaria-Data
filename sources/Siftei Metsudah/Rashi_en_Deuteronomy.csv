Deuteronomy 2:1," We turned and travelled into the wilderness.@p3 @rr°@bbHad they not sinned, they would have travelled by way of Mount Seir to enter the Land from its southern [border] to its northern [border]; but because they sinned they were forced to turn to the wilderness which is between the Reed Sea and the southern edge of Mount Seir. They then travelled along its southern edge moving from west to east. @d1By way of the Reed Sea [route].@d2 @rr°@bbThe route they travelled when leaving Egypt, which is the southwestern tip. From there they travelled eastward. @d1And we circled Mount Seir.@d2 @rr°@bbWe traversed its entire southern rim, until we came to the land of Moav. "
Deuteronomy 3:1, We turned and went up.@p3 The entire [journey] northward was uphill. 
Deuteronomy 4:2," Do not add.@p3 For instance to place five @ITparshiyos@it in the @ITtefillin,@it to take five species [of fruit] for the mitzvah of @ITlulav,@it to place five fringes [instead of four on one’s garment]; and this also applies to (the command), “And do not subtract from them.” "
Deuteronomy 5:3," Not with our fathers@p3 @rr°@bbalone did Adonoy make this covenant, etc., but with us, etc.. "
Deuteronomy 6:4," Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is one.@p3 @rr°@bbAdonoy who is presently our God and not the God of the nations, will in the future be [recognized] as the One God, as is said, “For then I will turn over to the peoples a pure language that they may all call upon the Name of Adonoy.” And it is said, “On that day Adonoy will be One and His name One.” @p15--6@p2 You are to love.@p3 @rr°@bbYou are to obey His words (commands) because of your love [for Him]. There is no comparison between one who obeys out of love and one who obeys out of fear. He who obeys (serves) his master out of fear, should the master over burden him, he will leave him and go away. @d1With all your heart.@d2 @rr°@bbWith your two inclinations. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation, “with all your heart” — your heart should not be fragmented with God. @d1With all your soul.@d2 Even if He were to take your soul. @d1And with all your possesions.@d2 With all your wealth. @rr°@bbThere are men whose wealth is dearer to them than their bodies. It is therefore said, “With all your possessions.” @rr°@bbAnother interpretation, “With what ever measure” — with what ever measure He apportions you, whether it is a measure of goodness or a measure of punishment (you must love Him). Similarly did Dovid say: “the cup of deliverance I will raise [and upon the Name, Adonoy, I will call]. “Trouble and sorrow I encounter, [and upon the Name, Adonoy, I call].” "
Deuteronomy 7:1," And He will cast out.@p3 This is an expression of casting away and displacing, and similarly, “And the iron flies off.” "
Deuteronomy 8:1," The entire @BImitzvah.@p3 @rr°@bbThis can be understood in its plain sense. @rr°@bbThere is also a Midrashic explanation: If you began to fulfill a @ITmitzvah,@it complete it; for the @ITmitzvah@it carries the name only [it is only accredited] of the one who completes it, as it is said, “And the bones of Yoseif which Bnei Yisroel brought up from Egypt they buried in Shechem.” Now, didn’t Moshe himself attend to them [the bones] to bring them [up from Egypt]? However, since he had no opportunity to complete it, and Bnei Yisroel did complete it, it is called by their name. "
Deuteronomy 9:1, Greater and more powerful than you.@p3 @rr°@bbYou are powerful but they are even more powerful than you. 
Deuteronomy 10:1," At that time.@p3 At the end of forty days, He granted me favor, and said, “Carve for yourself,” and, afterward, “Make for yourself an ark.” However, I made the ark first, for, when I arrive with the tablets in hand, where shall I place them? Now this is not the ark which Betzalel made, for they were not engaged with the Tabernacle until after Yom Kippur, since, it was only when he descended from the mountain that he instructed them concerning the construction of the Tabernacle. @rr°@bbAnd Betzalel made the Tabernacle first, and afterward the ark and the vessels. Hence, this was a different ark; this one went with them when they waged war, while the one Betzalel made did not go to war, except in Eli’s time, when they were punished over it, and it was captured. "
Deuteronomy 11:2," Know today.@p3 @rr°@bbPay close attention, so that you know and understand, and accept my reprimand. @d1For it is not with your children.@d2 @rr°@bbThat I now speak, who might say, ‘We do not know, nor have we seen, all this.’ "
Deuteronomy 12:2," You must obliterate.@p3 @rr°@bbDestroy, then destroy afterward. This teaches that, when destroying idolatry, one must tear out the roots. @d1All of the places where the nations worshipped, etc.@d2 @rr°@bbWhat must you obliterate from them? ‘Their gods on the mountains.’ "
Deuteronomy 13:1," Everything.@p3 The less significant as well as the greatly consequential. @d1Be careful to fulfill.@d2 This adds a negative command to the positive commands stated in this chapter, as “be careful” always denotes a negative command, except that one is not punished with lashes for violating “be careful” when it is added to a positive command. @d1Do not add to it.@d2 @rr°@bbFive @ITtotafos@it with the @ITtefilin,@it five species with the @ITlulav,@it four benedictions with the priestly benediction. "
Deuteronomy 14:1," Do not lacerate yourselves.@p3 @rr°@bbDo not inflict lacerations and gashes on your flesh over the dead, as is the custom among the Emorites for you are God’s children, and must therefore appear suitably becoming, rather than lacerated and hairless. @d1Between your eyes.@d2 Near the forehead. Elsewhere it is said, “They may not tear bald spots in their heads.” This equates the entire head with the area between the eyes. "
Deuteronomy 15:1," At the end of seven years.@p3 Perhaps seven years for each and every loan? The Torah therefore teaches, “The seventh year is approaching.” If you say that there are seven years for each and every loan? for everyone’s loan, how is it that it is approaching? This teaches that the seven years follow the count of the @ITshemitah@it cycle. "
Deuteronomy 16:1," Take heed of the month of spring.@p3 Before it arrives. Take heed that it is compatible with springtime, so that you may bring the @ITomer-mincha@it- offering. If not, add a month to the year. @d1From Egypt at night.@d2 But didn’t they leave by day, as it is said, “On the day after the pascal-offering, the Israelites went out, etc.”? But, because it was at night that Pharoah granted them permission to leave, as it is said, “He called for Moshe and Aharon at night, etc.” "
Deuteronomy 17:1," Do not sacrifice, etc., anything bad.@p3 @rr°@bbThis prohibits causing the @ITpigul@it disqualification of the sacred offerings through a pernicious statement. Additional derivations are extrapolated from this in the tractate dealing with the slaughter of the sacred offerings. "
Deuteronomy 18:1," The entire tribe of Levi.@p3 @rr°@bbWhether physically sound or blemished. @d1A portion.@d2 In the spoils. @d1Or an inheritance.@d2 In the land. @d1Adonoy’s fire offerings.@d2 The sacred offerings at the Sanctuary. @d1And His inheritance.@d2 @rr°@bbThis refers to the extra-Sanctuary sacred items — the @ITterumah@it-gifts and the tithes. However, they did not receive a complete inheritance among their brethren. Sifrei expounds: "
Deuteronomy 19:3," Ready the route.@p3 Refuge! Refuge! was emblazoned @rr°@bbat every fork in the road. @d1Divide the borders of your land into three sections.@d2 @rr°@bbThe distance from the border until the first of the refuge cities should be equivalent to the travelling distance between that city and the second; so, from the second to the third; and so from the third to the opposite border of Eretz Yisroel. "
Deuteronomy 20:1," When you go to war.@p3 @rr°@bbScripture positioned going to war here to teach that anyone lacking a body member is not qualified to go to war. @rr°@bbAnother interpretation. To teach that if you judge righteously, you will be assured when you go to war, that you will be victorious. Similarly, Dovid said, “I have acted justly and righteously — Do not abandon me to those who would dispossess me.” @d1Against your enemy.@d2 @rr°@bbConsider them enemies. @rr°@bbDo not pity them, for they will not pity you. @d1Horse and chariot.@d2 In My eyes, they are all like a single horse. Similarly, it says, “You shall strike down Midian as one man.” Similarly, @rr°@bbit says, “When Pharoah’s horse approached.” @d1People who outnumber you.@d2 @rr°@bbIn your eyes they are numerous, but in My eyes, they are not numerous. "
Deuteronomy 21:2," Your elders shall go out.@p3 @rr°@bbThe most distinguished of your elders. This refers to the supreme Sanhedrin. @d1And measure.@d2 @rr°@bbFrom the spot where the corpse is lying. @d1In the direction of the cities around the corpse.@d2 @rr°@bbIn every direction, in order to determine which is closest. "
Deuteronomy 22:1," And conceal yourself.@p3 @rr°@bbAvert your eyes as if you don’t notice it. @d1You may not observe . . . and conceal yourself.@d2 @rr°@bbYou may not observe it so as to conceal yourself. This is its plain meaning. @rr°@bbThe Rabbis, however, comment: At times, you may conceal yourself, etc. "
Deuteronomy 23:1," A man may not marry.@p3 @rr°@bbHe cannot effect marriage with her — marriage with her is legally invalid. @d1And may not expose the edge of his father’s garment.@d2 @rr°@bbHis father’s prospective levirate partner, appropriate for his father. But he was already warned concerning her, from “the nakedness of your father’s brother.” @rr°@bbEvidently, to transgress, with her, against two prohibitions, and to place, next to her, “the bastard may not enter,” @rr°@bbto teach that the bastard is only [someone born] of those liable to @ITkares@it excision; certainly judicial execution, @rr°@bbas no act of incest or adultery subject to judicial execution is exempt from @ITkares@it excision. "
Deuteronomy 24:1," For he found in her something lecherous.@p3 @rr°@bbHe is then commanded to divorce her, and that she should not find favor in his eyes. "
Deuteronomy 25:1," If a quarrel should occur.@p3 @rr°@bbThey will ultimately approach the court of justice. You may thus conclude that tranquility does not evolve from quarreling. What caused Lot to take leave of the saint? You may say, it was quarreling. @d1And they convict the villain.@d2 Perhaps everyone found liable in court is subject to flogging? The Torah therefore teaches, @rr°@bb”Should, the wicked one deserve flogging.” At times he is flogged, and at times he is not flogged. Who, then is liable to flogging? Learn from the context, “You may not muzzle an ox while it threshes” — @rr°@bba negative commandment unattached to a positive commandment. "
Deuteronomy 26:1, When it happens that you come . . . and you inherit it and settle it.@p3 @rr°@bbThis teaches that they were not obligated to bring the first fruits until they conquered the land and apportioned it. 
Deuteronomy 27:1, Keep all of the commandment.@p3 @rr°@bbThis denotes constancy. @ITGardant@it in Old French. 
Deuteronomy 28:4," The issue of your cattle.@p3 The offspring of your cattle, which the animal sends forth from her stomach. @d1And the flocks of your sheep.@d2 As Targum [Onkelos] renders. The Rabbis comment: @rr°@bbWhy are they called @hh עַשְׁתָּרוֹת@ee ? Because they enrich their owners and strengthen them, like the palisades, which are powerful cliffs. "
Deuteronomy 29:3," Yet Adonoy did not grant you a knowledgeable mind.@p3 @rr°@bbTo recognize God’s benevolence, and adhere to him. @d1Until this day.@d2 @rr°@bbI have heard: because on that day, when Moshe presented the Torah scroll to the sons of Levi — as it is written, “He presented it to the @ITkohanim,@it the sons of Levi” — all Yisroel appeared before Moshe, and said to him: “Our master Moshe, we, too, stood at Sinai. We accepted the Torah, and it was given to us. @rr°@bbHow is it that you are empowering your fellow tribesmen over it, so that they may tell us, some day in the future, ‘It was never given to you, it was given to us”’? Moshe rejoiced over this matter, and it was concerning this that he said to them, “This day, you have become a nation, etc.” This day I understand that you are attached to, and crave, the Omnipresent. "
Deuteronomy 30:3," Adonoy your God will bring [lit. come] back your returnees.@p3 It should have written ‘Bring back’ your returnees. The Rabbis derive from here, that the Divine Presence, with all due reverence, resides with Yisroel in the suffering of their exile, so that, when they are redeemed, He ascribes redemption to Himself — He shall return with them. One may explain additionally: The day of the ingathering of exiles is as momentous and difficult as if He, Himself, would need to carry, literally in His grasp, every individual from his place, @rr°@bbas it is said, “You shall be plucked, one at a time, Bnei Yisroel.” And even with regard to the exiles of other nations we find this, “I shall bring [lit. come] back the returnees of Moav,” [“I shall bring [lit. come] back the returnees of Egypt”]. "
Deuteronomy 31:1," Moshe went, etc.@p3 "
Deuteronomy 32:1," Hearken, O heaven.@p3 @rr°@bbThat I admonish the Israelites, @rr°@bbso that you may serve as witnesses to the matter. For so I informed them — that you would be witnesses. @rr°@bbSimilarly, “let the earth hear.” Why did he designate to testify against them heaven and earth? @rr°@bbMoshe said, “I am only flesh and blood, and tomorrow I may die. In case the Israelites declare, ‘We never assumed responsibility for fulfilling the covenant,’ who will refute them”? He therefore designated, to testify against them, heaven and earth, witnesses who endure forever. Furthermore, so that, if they so merit, the witnesses may come and reward them — “The grapevine shall give forth its fruit, the earth give forth its produce, and the heavens give forth their dew.” And if they are blameworthy, the hand of the witnesses may afflict them first — “He shall curb heaven, so that there will be no rain, and the earth shall not give forth its produce.” And after — “You shall quickly perish,” through the Gentile nations. "
Deuteronomy *32:32," For their grapevine is of the grapevine of Sedom.@p3 The nations’ grapevine. @d1And from the fields of Amorah, etc.@d2 But they pay no heed, and do not ascribe the greatness to Me. @d1Their grapes are grapes of bitter herbs.@d2 This follows what is said, “Were it not for the enemy’s amassed rage” [v. 27] — against Yisroel, to poison and embitter them. Therefore, let them have bitter clusters, to gorge them for their action against my children. "
Deuteronomy 33:1," This is the blessing . . . before his death.@p3 @rr°@bbClose to his death, for ‘If not now, when’? "
Deuteronomy 34:1," From the plains of Moav to Mount Nevo.@d2 @rr°@bbThere were a number of elevations, but Moshe vaulted them in a single leap. @d1The entire land.@d2 @rr°@bbHe showed him all of Eretz Yisroel in its tranquility, and the oppressors who are destined to afflict it. @d1Till Don.@d2 He showed him the idolatrous sons of Don, as it is said, “The sons of Don established for themselves the idol.” And He showed him Shimshon, who was destined to descend from him as a saviour.
