Version Notes,
Rashi on Numbers 1:1:1,"<b>In the Sinai desert . . . on the first [day] of the [second] month, etc.</b> °Because they (the Israelites) are precious before Him (Hashem), He counts them all the time; when they went out of Egypt He counted them [Shemos, 12:37], and when they fell because of [the sin of] the golden calf He counted them °to know the number of those who remained, when He came to cause His Presence to rest upon them He counted them. On the first day of Nisan the <i>Mishkon</i> was set up, °and on the first day of Iyar He counted them. "
Rashi on Numbers 1:2:1,<b>According to their families.</b> To know °the number of each tribe
Rashi on Numbers 1:2:2,<b>To the house of their fathers:</b> Someone whose father is from one tribe and his mother from another tribe shall be °maintained in his father’s tribe.
Rashi on Numbers 1:2:3,<b>Individually</b> °Through the <i>shekolim</i> a half-<i>shekel</i> per head.
Rashi on Numbers 1:3:1,"<b>All those eligible for the army.</b> This teaches us that no one is eligible for the army °below the age of twenty. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 1:4:1,"<b>Along with you, there shall be.</b> °When you count them, there shall be with you the leader of each tribe. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 1:16:1,<b>These are the ones called from the congregation.</b> The ones who were invited °to everything of importance in the congregation.
Rashi on Numbers 1:17:1,"<b>These men.</b> °Those twelve leaders [mentioned above, 5–15]. "
Rashi on Numbers 1:17:2,<b>Who were designated:</b> To him (Moshe) here by [their] names.
Rashi on Numbers 1:18:1,"<b>And they were registered by family ancestry.</b> They brought their °genealogical documents and witnesses who °verified the status of their birth, this applied to each individual, to establish their kinship with the tribe. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 1:49:1,"<b>However, the tribe of Levi you shall not count.</b> The King’s legion is worthy of being °counted separately. °Another interpretation; the Holy One, blessed is He, foresaw that a decree would arise against all those who were counted from the age of twenty and above to die in the desert. He [therefore] said, “Let these [Levites] not be included, for they are mine, since they did not sin with the [golden] calf.” "
Rashi on Numbers 1:50:1,"<b>You shall appoint the Levites.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] translates, “appoint.” The word denotes appointment to °authority over the subject of one’s appointment, as, “and let the king appoint officials.” (Esther 2) 
"
Rashi on Numbers 1:51:1,"<b>[They] shall take it down.</b> °As Targum (Onkelos) translates, “they shall dismantle.” °When they were going to depart in the desert from journey to journey they would dismantle it (the <i>Mishkon</i>) from its upright position and carry it to the place where the cloud came to rest. They camped there and set it up. "
Rashi on Numbers 1:51:2,<b>And the stranger who approaches:</b> °To [perform] this service of theirs.
Rashi on Numbers 1:51:3,<b>Shall die:</b> °By the hand of heaven.
Rashi on Numbers 1:52:1,"<b>And each man at his own banner.</b> According to the way that the banners are arranged in this book (i.e., Bamidbar, 2:3–31), three tribes to each banner. "
Rashi on Numbers 1:53:1,"<b>So that there will not be anger.</b> If you fulfill My commandments there will not be anger, but if not — if strangers will enter into this service of theirs — °there will be anger, °as we find in the episode of Korach, “. . . for the anger had emerged . . .” [17:11] 
"
Rashi on Numbers 2:2:1,"<b>With the insignia.</b> Each banner shall have [as] its insignia a colored cloth hanging from it. °Each one’s color was not like the other’s, each color corresponded with the hue of its gem set in the breastplate. Thusly, everyone could recognize his banner. Another interpretation [of] “with the insignia of their fathers’ houses”; By the sign their forefather Yaakov gave them °when they carried him from Egypt [for burial in Canaan], as it is said, “And his sons did to him just as he had commanded them” [Bereishis, 50:12]. ‘Yehudah, Yissachar, and Zevulun shall carry him from the east, Reuven, Shimon, and Gad from the south; etc.,’ as stated by Tanchuma to this portion. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 2:2:2,"<b>At a distance:</b> °At the distance of a <i>mil</i> (2,000 <i>amos,</i> approximately 4,000 feet.) as stated in the Book of Joshua [3:4], ‘However, there should be a distance between you and it (the sacred ark) of two thousand <i>amos</i>’, To enable them to come on Shabbos. Moshe and Aharon and his sons and the Levites camped near it (the <i>Mishkon</i>). "
Rashi on Numbers 2:3:1,"<b>In the forefront.</b> Toward the side called קֶדֶם, the front. Which is this? °This is the eastern side whereas the west is called אָחוֹר, the rear. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 2:9:1,"<b>They travel first.</b> °When they see the cloud rise, the <i>kohanim</i> blow the trumpets and the camp of Yehudah departs first. When traveling, they move °the way they camped; The Levites and the wagons at the center, the banner of Yehudah to the east, that of Reuven to the south, Ephraim's to the west, and Don’s to the north. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 2:17:1,<b>The Tent of Meeting shall travel.</b> °After those two banners.
Rashi on Numbers 2:17:2,"<b>Just as they camp, so shall they travel:</b> As I explained, they traveled as they camped, each banner proceeding in its designated position. "
Rashi on Numbers 2:17:3,"<b>In his place [literally “his hand”]</b> In his place. Yet, the literal meaning, “his hand” is not out of context. One’s nearby area is called “at hand,” [i.e.,] adjacent, within hand’s reach. <i>en son aise,</i> at hand, in Old French. "
Rashi on Numbers 2:20:1,"<b>With him [literally “above him”].</b> °As Targum [Onkelos] translates, “the one near him.” 
"
Rashi on Numbers 3:1:1,"<b>These are the descendants of Aharon and Moshe.</b> [Scripture] mentions only the sons of Aharon, yet they are called the descendants of Moshe — because he taught them Torah. This teaches us that one who teaches another’s son Torah is considered as having procreated him. "
Rashi on Numbers 3:1:2,"<b>On the day that Adonoy spoke to Moshe</b> They became his descendants, °since he taught them what he had learned from the mouth of the Almighty. "
Rashi on Numbers 3:4:1,"<b>In the presence [literally “the face”] of Aharon.</b> °During his lifetime. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 3:6:1,"<b>And they shall serve him.</b> What is the service? [The next passage explains —] °”They shall preserve his guardianship;” since he (Aharon) is obligated to guard the Sanctuary so that no stranger may approach, as it is said, “. . . you (Aharon), your sons, and your father’s house with you shall bear [responsibility for] the sin of [defiling] the Sanctuary . . .,” and these Levites aided them, this is the service. "
Rashi on Numbers 3:6:2,
Rashi on Numbers 3:7:1,"<b>They shall take care to preserve his guardianship.</b> Any position to which a person is appointed which requires his active management is called a “watch” throughout Scripture, and in the Mishnaic idiom, as stated concerning Bigsan and Seresh, “But surely my watch is not similar to yours”? Similarly, the “watches” of the <i>kohanim</i> and Levites. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 3:8:1,"<b>And the watch of Bnei Yisroel.</b> They were all actually obligated to provide the needs of the Sanctuary; the Levites merely served in their place, as surrogates. This is why they (the Levites) accepted the tithes from them, in payment, as it is said, “. . . for it (the tithe) is your payment, in return for your service . . .” "
Rashi on Numbers 3:9:1,<b>They are presented to him.</b> °For assistance.
Rashi on Numbers 3:9:2,"<b>From [among] Bnei Yisroel</b> This [מֵאֵת, “from”] is understood as מִתּוֹךְ, “from among” Bnei Yisroel, meaning °from the rest of the entire congregation they (the Levites) were selected for this by Divine decree and He (God) gave them to him (Aharon), as it is said, “I (God) have given the Levites, given [them] . . .” 
"
Rashi on Numbers 3:10:1,"<b>Appoint Aharon and his sons.</b> The word connotes appointment, not counting. "
Rashi on Numbers 3:10:2,"<b>And they shall guard their priesthood.</b> Referring to the blood [of the sacrificial offerings], sprinkling [it on the altar], burning [the sacrifices], [and other] services entrusted to the <i>kohanim.</i> "
Rashi on Numbers 3:12:1,"<b>Behold, I have taken [the Levites].</b> What is My right to them? <b>From among Bnei Yisroel</b> That the Israelites must hire them to serve Me? Through the [Israelites’] first born, I gained my right to them, having taken them (the Levites) in their place. Because the sacred service was [originally performed] by the firstborn, but when they sinned with the golden calf, they were disqualified. The Levites, who did not indulge in idolatry, were chosen instead. "
Rashi on Numbers 3:12:2,
Rashi on Numbers 3:15:1,"<b>From the age of one month and above.</b> When he (the infant) can no longer be categorized as stillborn, he is listed among those entitled “guardian of the sacred watch.” R’ Yehudah B’rabi Shalom said, “This [Levite] tribe is regularly counted from the womb, as it is said, “. . . [Yocheved, Levi’s daughter] . . . whom she (Levi’s wife) bore to Levi in Egypt . . .” While entering the portals of Egypt, °she bore her (Yocheved). yet she is counted among the seventy souls [who came down to Egypt]. for, when one tallies their total, one finds only sixty-nine and she completed the total. "
Rashi on Numbers 3:16:1,"<b>According to the word of Adonoy.</b> Moshe said before the Holy One, Blessed is He, °”How can I enter into their tents to determine the number of their nursing infants”? The Holy One, Blessed is He, replied, “Do yours, and I will do Mine”! Moshe proceeded, and stood at the door of the tent, whereupon the Divine Presence preceded him [and entered the tent]. A voice then echoed from the tent, announcing, “There are so many and so many nursing infants in this tent”! This is why it is said, “. . . according to the word of God . . .” 
"
Rashi on Numbers 3:21:1,"<b>Of Gershon, the family of Livni.</b> Meaning, of Gershon, those who were counted [was] °the family of Livni and the family of Shim’i — °their numbers were so many and so many. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 3:25:1,<b>The Mishkon.</b> °The lower [ceiling] drapes.
Rashi on Numbers 3:25:2,"<b>And the Tent.</b> °The goats’ hair drapes, made [to serve] as the roof. "
Rashi on Numbers 3:25:3,"<b>Its Cover.</b> °Ram skins and <i>tachash</i> skins. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 3:25:4,<b>And the curtain for the entrance</b> This is °the drape.
Rashi on Numbers 3:26:1,"<b>And its ropes.</b> °Of the <i>Mishkon</i> and the tent, but not the enclosure. "
Rashi on Numbers 3:29:1,"<b>The families of the children of Kehos shall camp . . . on the south.</b> Near them [was] the banner of Reuven, who camped to the south. °Woe to the wicked, woe to his neighbor! This is why [Reuven’s constituents] were punished — Doson, Avirom, °and two hundred and fifty men — together with Korach and his assembly, because they (the Reuvenites) were drawn, with them, into the dispute. "
Rashi on Numbers 3:31:1,"<b>And the curtain.</b> This is the <i>Paroches,</i> as it was also called “. . . the <i>Paroches</i> screen . . .” 
"
Rashi on Numbers 3:32:1,<b>The leader of the leaders of Levi.</b> [He was] °appointed over all of them. Over what was his leadership?
Rashi on Numbers 3:32:2,"<b>The appointment of the guardians to safeguard — </b> They were all appointed by him. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 3:38:1,"<b>Moshe, Aharon and his sons.</b> °Near them [was] the banner of the camp of Yehudah, and those who camped near him, Yissachar and Zevulun. Good fortune to the righteous, good fortune to his neighbor! Because they were neighbors of Moshe, who engaged in Torah [study], they became great Torah scholars, as it is said, “Yehudah my lawgiver”; “From the sons of Yissachar of sagacious knowledge, etc.” — [this refers to] two hundred heads of Sanhedrin; “and from Zevulun, came those that handle the scribe’s quill.” "
Rashi on Numbers 3:39:1,"<b>Whom Moshe and Aharon counted.</b> °There are dots over [the word] וְאַהֲרֹן, to teach that he was not included in the counting of the Levites. "
Rashi on Numbers 3:39:2,"<b>Twenty two thousand.</b> When counting them individually, however, one discovers three hundred extra: the sons of Gershon, seven thousand five hundred; the sons of Kehos, eight thousand six hundred; the sons of Merori, six thousand two hundred [hence, twenty two thousand three hundred]. Why aren’t they included among the rest to redeem the firstborn, thus exempting the two hundred seventy three overlapping firstborn from redemption? Our sages answered, in Maseches Bechoros, that the three hundred Levites were, themselves, firstborn. It was sufficient °for them to release themselves from redemption. "
Rashi on Numbers 3:40:1,"<b>Count every male firstborn . . . from the age of one month and above.</b> When he (the infant) can no longer be categorized as stillborn. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 3:45:1,"<b>And the animals of the Levites . . .etc.</b> The animals of the Levites did not redeem the firstlings of the Israelites’ clean (i.e., kosher) animals, °but [they did redeem] the firstlings of their donkeys. And a single sheep belonging to a Levite released numerous of the Israelites’ donkey firstlings. The proof is that Scripture counts the extra men, °but did not count the extra animals. "
Rashi on Numbers 3:46:1,"<b>And the redemption of the [two hundred and seventy-]three.</b> The firstborn who require redemption among them (the Israelites), these are the two hundred seventy-three extras among them, over and above the Levites. From them, °take five <i>shekolim</i> per head. This was the sale price for Yoseif, twenty silver [pieces], who was Rochel’s firstborn. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 3:49:1,<b>[Those whose numbers were] in excess of those who were redeemed through the Levites.</b> Those redeemed by the very presence of the Levites.
Rashi on Numbers 3:50:1,"<b>One thousand three hundred sixty five.</b> This is the sum total, [at] five <i>shekolim</i> per head. For two hundred firstborn: one thousand <i>shekolim.</i> For seventy firstborn — three hundred and fifty <i>shekolim.</i> For three firstborn — fifteen <i>shekolim.</i> He (Moshe) said, “How shall I do this? Any firstborn whom I tell to pay five <i>shekolim</i> will say, ‘I am from those redeemed by the Levites”’! What did he do? He brought °twenty-two thousand slips and wrote “Levite” on them, and two hundred and seventy three slips and wrote “five <i>shekolim</i>” on them. He mixed them together, and placed them in a container. [Then] he told them, “Come, choose your slips by lot.” 
"
Rashi on Numbers 4:2:1,"<b>Take the count . . . etc.</b> Count those among them suited °for the service of carrying, the ones from thirty to fifty years of age. Someone younger than thirty, has not reached prime strength. From here they (the Rabbis) derive “[the age of] thirty for strength” and after fifty, one’s strength diminishes. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 4:4:1,"<b>The Holy of Holies.</b> The Holiest of all; the Ark, the Table, the Menorah, the Altars, the Paroches, and the service vessels. "
Rashi on Numbers 4:5:1,"<b>Aharon and his sons shall enter . . . etc.</b> They shall place each vessel into the sheath specified for it in this chapter, so that the Levite sons of Kehos need do nothing but carry [them]. "
Rashi on Numbers 4:5:2,"<b>When the camp is about to travel.</b> °When the cloud rises, they know that they are to depart. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 4:7:1,"<b>Molds, spoons, rods, covering props.</b> I have explained this in [the chapter dealing with] the work of the <i>Mishkon.</i> "
Rashi on Numbers 4:7:2,"<b>Covering.</b> Covering, from the word מָסָךְ, cover, as it is written, “. . . by which they (the breads) shall be covered.” "
Rashi on Numbers 4:9:1,<b>Its tongs.</b> A type of pliers with which they pull the wick in any desired direction.
Rashi on Numbers 4:9:2,"<b>Its scoops.</b> A type of small spoon with a flat, uncurved bottom, unwalled at the front — only at the sides, with which he rakes the ashes from the lamps when cleaning them. "
Rashi on Numbers 4:9:3,"<b>It lamps.</b> <i>Loces,</i> lamps, in Old French, °in which the oil and wicks are placed. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 4:10:1,<b>Into the covering of the tachash — hide.</b> A type of °sack.
Rashi on Numbers 4:12:1,"<b>All the service utensils with which they serve in the Sanctuary.</b> °Inside the <i>Mishkon,</i> which is Holy. These are the incense vessels, with which they serve on the inner altar. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 4:13:1,<b>They shall remove the ashes from the Altar. </b> The copper altar.
Rashi on Numbers 4:13:2,<b>They shall remove the ashes.</b> °They shall take the ashes away from it.
Rashi on Numbers 4:13:3,"<b>And spread upon it a cloth of purple [wool].</b> The fire which descended from heaven lay below the cloth °like a lion when they traveled. It didn’t burn it (the cloth), because they arched a copper °vessel over it. "
Rashi on Numbers 4:14:1,"<b>Firepans.</b> With these they raked the coals for the lifting of the ashes. This was made like a pan with only three sides, and the front was used to draw the coals. "
Rashi on Numbers 4:14:2,"<b>Forks.</b> Copper hooks with which they prodded the limbs on the altar, turning them so that they would be completely consumed quickly. "
Rashi on Numbers 4:14:3,"<b>Scoops.</b> These were scrapers, In Old French, <i>Wadil,</i> scoops. They were made of copper, and used to sweep the ashes from the Altar. "
Rashi on Numbers 4:15:1,<b>Covering of the Sanctuary.</b> The Ark and the Altar.
Rashi on Numbers 4:15:2,<b>And all of the holy utensils.</b> °The Menorah and the service vessels.
Rashi on Numbers 4:15:3,"<b>And they will [not] die.</b> °Since, if they touch, they will be subject to death by Heavenly decree. "
Rashi on Numbers 4:16:1,"<b>Encharged to Elazar.</b> He was assigned °to carry them; oil, incense, and anointing oil. The continual [daily] meal-offering. His responsibility was to issue orders, to urge [the others], and to offer it [on the altar] when they camped. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 4:16:2,"<b>The charge of the entire Mishkon.</b> In addition, he was assigned to [oversee] the load of the sons of Kehos — °to issue orders for everyone’s work and load. This is [what is meant by] “the <i>Mishkon and all of its contents,” everything listed above in this chapter. But the load of the sons of Gershon and Merori, which did not consist of the holy of holies, was by order of Isamar, as is written in the portion of נָשׂא . 
</i>"
Rashi on Numbers 4:18:1,<b>Do not cut off.</b> °Do not cause them to die.
Rashi on Numbers 4:20:1,"<b>They shall not come in to see when the holy is being covered.</b> [When placed] into its sheath, as specified above in this chapter, they shall spread over it a certain cloth, they shall cover it with a certain cover. °Its “ בִּלּוּעַ “ refers to the covering of it. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 4:20:2,
Rashi on Numbers 4:22:1,"<b>Take the count of the sons of Gershon, as well.</b> °Just as I commanded you conce ning the sons of Kehos, to determine how many °have reached the working category. "
Rashi on Numbers 4:25:1,<b>The tapestries of the Mishkon.</b> °The ten lower ones.
Rashi on Numbers 4:25:2,"<b>And the Tent of Meeting.</b> The °goat-hair tapestries, made as a tent over it (the <i>Mishkon</i>). "
Rashi on Numbers 4:25:3,<b>Its covering.</b> The °red dyed rams’ skins.
Rashi on Numbers 4:25:4,"<b>The screen for the entrance.</b> °The eastern curtain. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 4:26:1,"<b>Which are over the Mishkon.</b> As if it had said, “The curtains and screen of the courtyard enclosure which protect and °guard over the <i>Mishkon 
and °the copper altar on all sides.” 
</i>"
Rashi on Numbers 4:26:2,"<b>And all that will be given [lit. made] to them.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] translates, °”all that will be given to them” — to the sons of Gershon. "
Rashi on Numbers 4:27:1,"<b>By instruction of Aharon and [one of] his sons.</b> Which of his sons is °appointed over them? Under the supervision of Isamar, son of Aharon, the <i>kohein.</i> 
"
Rashi on Numbers 4:32:1,"<b>Their stakes and ropes.</b> Of the pillars, since the the stakes and ropes of the curtains were in the load of the sons of Gershon. There were stakes and ropes at the bottom of the tapestries and curtains, so that the wind would not lift them; and there were stakes °and ropes for the pillars, on all sides, from which to hang the curtains, °by their upper border, with bars °and rods, as is taught in [the Beraysa of] the work of the <i>Mishkon.</i> 
 "
Rashi on Numbers 4:47:1,"<b>The service of service.</b> This refers to the song of the cymbals and the harps, which is °service for [another] service. "
Rashi on Numbers 4:47:2,<b>And the service of carrying.</b> °As the phrase indicates.
Rashi on Numbers 4:49:1,"<b>And they were counted, as Adonoy commanded Moshe.</b> Those counted were, as commanded, °from the ages of thirty to fifty. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 5:2:1,"<b>Command Bnei Yisroel.</b> °This <i>parshah</i> was said on the day the <i>Mishkon</i> was erected. Eight <i>parshiyos</i> were said on that day, as is stated in Tractate Gittin, <i>perek</i> Hanizakin. "
Rashi on Numbers 5:2:2,"<b>They must expel from the camp.</b> There were °three camps when they rested: Within the curtains was the camp of the <i>Shechinah;</i> the surrounding Levite encampment, as stated expressly in the <i>parshah</i> of Bemidbar Sinai, was the camp of the Levites; from there to the end of the encampment of the banners, in all the four directions, was the camp of the Israelites. The <i>metzoro</i> was sent °out of all of them. The <i>zav</i> was permitted in the camp of the Israelites, but expelled from the [other] two. A person defiled by the dead was permitted even among the [encampment of] the Levites, being expelled only °from the encampment of the <i>Shechinah.</i> All this, the Rabbis derive from Scriptural passages in Maseches Pesachim. "
Rashi on Numbers 5:2:3,"<b>Defiled by a [departed] soul.</b> [Onkelos renders] דִּמְסָאָב לִטְמֵי נַפְשָׁא דֶאֱנָשָׁא, (“who were defiled by the bones of a human soul.”) In my opinion, the word °means “human bones” in Aramaic. There are many [examples] in Bereishis Rabbah, “ טַמְיָא “ אַדְרִיאָנוּס שְׁחִיק — may [his] “bones” be crushed. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 5:6:1,"<b>Acting treacherously against Adonoy.</b> Scripture now reiterates the <i>parshah</i> of the thief who swears falsely, previously stated in the Portion of Vayikra, “[If a person sins] . . . and acts treacherously against God, lying to his fellow . . .” It is repeated here for the sake of two innovations. Firstly, Scripture writes “And they confess . . . [their sin],” teaching that he (the thief) is not required to pay the fifth and bring the <i>asham</i> (guilt-offering) when convicted by the testimony of witnesses, unless he confesses to the act. And secondly, [to teach] that property stolen from a proselyte must be given to the <i>kohanim.</i> "
Rashi on Numbers 5:7:1,<b>Principal amount of his guilt.</b> °This is the principal [payment] concerning which he took the oath.
Rashi on Numbers 5:7:2,<b>To whom he is indebted.</b> To the one °to whom he is liable.
Rashi on Numbers 5:8:1,<b>But if the man has no redeemer.</b> As the claimant died who put him (the thief) to the oath — without heirs.
Rashi on Numbers 5:8:2,"<b>To whom the debt may be returned.</b> °When he (the thief) recants and confesses to his crime. The Rabbis remark, ‘Is there anyone in Yisroel without redeemers, whether a son, brother, or paternal blood relation [branching] upward to [the patriarch] Yaakov? But °[this refers to] a proselyte who died without heirs. "
Rashi on Numbers 5:8:3,<b>The debt being returned.</b> °This is the principal and the fifth thereof.
Rashi on Numbers 5:8:4,"<b>To Adonoy, [then] to the kohein.</b> God takes possession of it, °then gives it to the <i>kohein [serving] °in that watch. </i>"
Rashi on Numbers 5:8:5,"<b>Besides the ram of forgiveness.</b> °Mentioned in Vayikra, which he is required to bring. "
Rashi on Numbers 5:9:1,"<b>Every terumah-gift, etc.</b> R’ Yishmael said, “Is <i>terumah</i>-gift brought to the <i>kohein</i>? Does he not seek it, himself, in the granary? Then why does the Torah state, ‘ . . . which they bring to the <i>kohein</i>?’ These are the <i>bikurim</i>-gifts, about which it is stated, ‘[. . . the first fruits of your land] must be brought to the House of Adonoy, your God.’ °But one does not know what must be done with them. The Torah therefore states, ‘ . . . to the <i>kohein,</i> it shall belong to him.’ Scripture teaches, concerning the <i>bikurim</i>-gifts, that they must be given to the <i>kohein.</i> "
Rashi on Numbers 5:10:1,"<b>A man’s sacred objects shall be his.</b> Since the priestly and Levite gifts are mandated, one might assume that they may confiscate them forcefully. The Torah therefore teaches that “A man’s sacred objects shall be his,” °informing [us] that the executory benefits belong to the [original Israelite] owner. Many other homiletical interpretations are offered by Sifri. Midrash Aggadah [states], “A man’s sacred objects shall be his” [states]: If someone withholds his tithes, and refuses to give them, [then] “[they shall] be his” — the tithes. Ultimately, his land will yield only one tenth of its normal produce. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 5:10:2,<b>Whatever a man gives to the kohein [lit. A man who gives to the <i>kohein].</i></b><i> The proper gifts. </i>
Rashi on Numbers 5:10:3,<b>Shall be his.</b> Great riches.
Rashi on Numbers 5:12:1,"<b>If any man’s wife goes astray.</b> °What is written [immediately] above this subject? “A man’s sacred objects shall be his.” (v. 10) [This implies that] If you withhold the <i>kohein’s</i> gifts, then by your life! You will find it necessary to visit him, to bring the <i>sotah</i> to him. "
Rashi on Numbers 5:12:2,"<b>Any man [lit. A man, a man].</b> This teaches that she is doubly treacherous; against the “man of warfare” on high, and her husband [lit. “man”] below. "
Rashi on Numbers 5:12:3,"<b>[If any man’s] wife goes astray.</b> Our Rabbis teach: Adulterers do not commit adultery unless they are imbued with the °spirit of foolishness, as it is written כִּי תִשְׂטֶה [lit. acts foolishly]. and it is written, “the adulterer lacks reason”: The simple explanation of the verse is, “[If any man’s wife] °turns aside from the ways of modesty” and arouses his suspicion, as in “turn aside from him, and pass by,” “let your heart not turn to her ways. "
Rashi on Numbers 5:12:4,"<b>And acts treacherously toward him.</b> °What is the treachery? 
"
Rashi on Numbers 5:13:1,<b>And a man has lain.</b> This excludes a minor and a non-human.
Rashi on Numbers 5:13:2,"<b>With her.</b> °Lying with her disqualifies her. but not laying with her sister (as in the incident of two sisters who resembled one another). 
"
Rashi on Numbers 5:13:3,"<b>But it was hidden from her husband’s eyes.</b> °This excludes a blind man. Therefore, if he (the husband) saw [the adultery] and feigned ignorance, the [bitter] waters do not test her. "

Rashi on Numbers 7:85:1,"<b>One hundred thirty [shekolim was the weight of] each tray.</b> Why does the Torah say this? Because it said “one hundred thirty [<i>shekolim</i> was] its weight,” but does not explain °by which <i>shekel</i> standard.

Rashi on Numbers 7:86:1,"<b>Twelve golden spoons.</b> Why is this said? Because it says, “one spoon of ten gold,” [meaning] °it was golden, and it weighed ten silver <i>shekolim</i>.

Rashi on Numbers 11:8:4,"<b> לְשַׁד הַשָׁמֶן .</b> The moisture of oil. This is how Donash explained it. Similar to this, “ לְשַׁדִּי was overturned by the heat of summer.” °The “<i>lamed</i>” is part of the root, “My moisture was overturned by the heat of summer.” The Rabbis, however, explain it as a term meaning שָׁדַיִם, “breasts.” But שָׁדַיִם have no relation to oil. One cannot say that לְשַׁד הַשָׁמֶן is translated like וַיִשְׁמַן יְשׁוּרוּן, “The righteous were fattened,” for, if so, the “ מ “ would be vocalized with a minor “<i>kametz</i>” (“<i>tzeirei</i>”) and the emphasis below, under the “ מ .” Now that the “ מ “ is vocalized with a minor “<i>patach</i>” (“<i>segol</i>”) and the emphasis is below the “ ש,” it is translated as “oil.” The “ ש “ is vocalized with a major “<i>kametz</i>” (<i>”kametz”</i>), but not with a minor “<i>patach</i>” (<i>”segol”</i>), because it closes the passge. Another interpretation: לְשַׁד is an acronym, [spelling] לִ'ישׁ, שֶׁ'מֶן, דְּ'בַשׁ, °kneaded, oil, honey. [It was] like a loaf kneaded with oil and coated with honey. Onkelos’ translation, rendered “kneaded with oil,” °leans toward Donash’s interpretation, since a loaf kneaded with oil contains the moisture of oil. "
Rashi on Numbers 11:10:1,"<b>Weep according to their families.</b> Every family gathered together and wept, to publicize their complaints openly. The Rabbis remark that לְמִשְׁפְּחוֹתָיו means “concerning family matters” — concerning °the intimate relations forbidden to them. "
Rashi on Numbers 11:12:1,"<b>That You say [lit. will say].</b> °That You say to me, ‘carry it in your lap.’ Where did He say this to him? “Go, lead the people.” And it says, “He commanded them (Moshe and Aharon) to [lead] Bnei Yisroel” [even] on condition °that they stone you and insult you. "

Rashi on Numbers 11:15:2,"<b>So that I will not see my evil.</b> It should have written “their evil,” but Scripture euphemizes. This is °one of the “scribes’ adjustments” to the Torah, for the sake of euphemistic language adjustment. "
Rashi on Numbers 11:16:1,"<b>Gather for Me.</b> Here is °the reply to your complaint when you said, “I am unable, alone . . .” But where were the original elders? Had they not sat with them even in Egypt, as it says: “Go, gather the elders of Israel”? Evidently, they died at the fire of “Tav’erah.” They deserved this at Sinai, as it is written, “they gazed at God.” Because they acted frivolously, °like someone munching his loaf while speaking before the king.

Rashi on Numbers 11:20:1,"<b>For a month of days.</b> °This was with the [comparatively] virtuous ones, who fell ill in their beds and afterwards expired. But with the wicked ones it says, “the meat was still between their teeth.” This is how it is taught by Sifri. Mechilta, however, teaches the reverse. The wicked ones ate and suffered for thirty days, but with the decent ones — the meat was still between their teeth. "
Rashi on Numbers 11:20:2,"<b>Until it comes out of your nostrils.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] translates, °”you are disgusted by it.” It will seem to you as if you gorged on it until it is expelled through the nose. "

Rashi on Numbers 11:22:1,"<b>Will sheep and cattle be slaughtered.</b> This is one of four instances expounded upon by R’ Akiva, which R’ Shimon did not expound as he did. R’ Akiva said, “Six hundred thousand on foot, etc. and You say ‘I will give them meat to eat for a month of days’? Will sheep and cattle . . . ?” Everything according to the straightforward interpretation, who will satisfy them? This is similar to what is said, “And he has sufficient means for its redemption.” °Now which is worse, this, or, “listen, here, rebels!”? Yet, since he did not say it publicly, Scripture spared him and did not punish him; but the one during the dispute was public — Scripture, therefore, did not spare him. R’ Shimon said, Heaven forbid! Such a thought never occurred to that righteous man. Someone of whom it is written, “In all My houshold he is [most] faithful” would say, ‘The Omnipresent cannot satisfy us’? Rather, this is what he said: Six hundred thousand on foot, etc., and You said, ‘I will give them meat for a month,’ and then you will kill a nation as great as this? Will sheep and cattle be slaughered for them so that they should be killed, and this meal will [thus] satisfy them forever? Does this bring you praise, telling a donkey, ‘Eat a ton of barley and then we will chop your head off’? The Holy One, Blessed is He, answered him: But if I do not give it to them, they will say My power [lit. hand] is limited. Is it favorable, in your eyes, that God’s power be limited in their eyes? Let them, and a hundred like them, perish, but My power cannot seem limited to them even for a moment. "
Rashi on Numbers 11:23:1,"<b>Now you will see if My words will occur.</b> Raban Gamliel, son of R’ Yehudah Hanasi said: (Moshe said:) “It is impossible to maintain one’s position °in [such] a dispute. Since they only seek a pretext, You cannot satisfy them, in the end they will judge You critically. If You give them beef, they will say ‘we wanted mutton,’ if You give them mutton, they will say ‘we wanted beef, we wanted wild game or fowl, we wanted fish or locusts.’ He (God) said to him: ‘If so, they will say My power is limited.’ He (Moshe) said before Him: ‘Here, I will go and appease them.’ He (God) said: ‘Now you will see if My word occurs — they will not listen to you.’ Moshe went to appease them. He said to them: ‘Is God’s power limited? Behold, He struck the rock and water flowed, etc., then He can also provide bread.’ They said: °‘This is a compromise — He does not have the power to fulfill our request.”’ This is what is meant when it says, “Moshe went out and spoke to the people.” When they didn’t listen to him — “He gathered seventy men, etc.” "
Rashi on Numbers 11:25:1,"<b>And did not cease.</b> They did not prophesy, except for that day alone — this is clearly stated by Sifri. But Onkelos renders “and did not cease” — prophesy did not cease from them. "

Rashi on Numbers 11:26:2,"<b>They were among those inscribed.</b> Among those chosen for the Sanhedrin. They were all inscribed specifically by names, and by drawing lots. Since the appropriate amount for twelve tribes was six for each tribe, except for two tribes, each of whom received only five, Moshe said: No tribe will listen to me to subtract one elder from its tribe. What did he do? He took seventy two notes, wrote “elder” on seventy °and left two blank. He then chose six from each tribe, totaling seventy two. He told them, ‘Take your notes from the container.’ Whoever chose “elder” was sanctified; to those who chose the empty ones, he said, “The Omnipresent does not want you.” "

Rashi on Numbers 11:28:1,"<b>Destroy them.</b> Burden them with communal responsibility, °and they will destroy themselves. Another interpretation: Detain them °in prison, because they prophesied that Moshe would die and Yehoshua would bring the Israelites into the land. "
Rashi on Numbers 11:29:1,<b>Are you vengeful for me?</b> Are you my avenger? Do you take my vengeance for me? 
Rashi on Numbers 11:29:2,"לִי meaning the same as בִּשְׁבִילִי, “for my sake.” קִנְאָה always denotes a person who takes something to heart, whether to avenge or to assist. “<i>enprenment</i>” in Old French, °one who grasps the bulk of the burden. "

Rashi on Numbers 11:30:3,"<b>Entered.</b> The connotation is to enter a house, as in, “Bring it into your house.” The source for this general connotation is, “He gathers, but does not know who will bring it in.” This teaches that he did not visit punishment upon them until each of the righteous had entered his tent.

Rashi on Numbers 11:33:1,"<b>Before it was finished.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] renders, עַד לָא פְסַק, °(before it was finished). Another interpretation: There was no opportunity to cut it with his teeth, when he expired. "
Rashi on Numbers 12:1:1,"<b>[Miriam] spoke.</b> דִּבּוּר always connotes harshness, as it says, “The man who rules the land spoke harshly with us.” But אֲמִירָה always connotes pleading, as it says, “He said, please, my brothers, do not be wicked,” “He said, please hear my words.” נָא always connotes a request.

Rashi on Numbers 12:1:2,"<b>Miriam and Aharon spoke.</b> She opened the discussion first, so Scripture gives her precedence. °How did Miriam know that Moshe separated from his wife? R’ Noson says: Miriam was at Tziporah’s side when Moshe was told that Eldad and Meidad were prophesying in the camp. When Tziporah heard, she said, ‘Woe to their wives if they become attached to prophecy, because they will separate from their wives the way my husband separated from me.’ Miriam knew from there, and she told Aharon. Now if Miriam, who did not intend to slander him, was punished this way, certainly someone who relates slander about his fellow. "
Rashi on Numbers 12:1:3,"<b>The Cushite woman.</b> This teaches that everyone agreed to her beauty, °just as everyone agrees to the blackness of the Cushite. "
Rashi on Numbers 12:1:4,"<b>Cushite.</b> [כּוּשִׁית is] numerically equivalent to יְפַת מַרְאֶה, (“beautiful in appearance.”) "
Rashi on Numbers 12:1:5,<b>Concerning the woman.</b> °Concerning her divorce.
Rashi on Numbers 12:1:6,"<b>For, he married a Cushite woman.</b> What does the Torah teach? You find a woman beautiful in appearance but not beautiful in deed; in deed, but not in appearance. But this one was beautiful in everything. "
Rashi on Numbers 12:1:7,"<b>The Cushite woman.</b> Because of her beauty, she was called “Cushite,” like a man who calls his attractive son “Cushite” to ward off the power of the evil eye over him. "

Rashi on Numbers 12:4:1,"<b>Suddenly.</b> He revealed Himself to them °suddenly, when they were ritually unclean because of marital relations, and they cried, °”Water! Water!” To inform them that Moshe acted properly in separating from his wife, since the Divine Presence revealed Itself to him constantly, with no designated time for the Word. "
Rashi on Numbers 12:4:2,"<b>Come out, all three of you.</b> This teaches that all three were summoned with a single word, which is impossible for the mouth to say and the ear to hear.

Rashi on Numbers 12:5:1,"<b>In a pillar of cloud.</b> °He went alone, unlike the custom of mortals. When a mortal king goes to war, he goes out with a large retinue, when he goes in peace, he goes with only a few. But the custom of the Holy One, Blessed is He, is to go to war alone, as it is said, “[God is] a warrior,” and goes in peace with a large retinue, as is said, “God rides with twenty two thousand angels.” "
Rashi on Numbers 12:5:2,<b>He called [to] Aharon and Miriam.</b> °So that they would be drawn away and leave the courtyard towards the Word.
Rashi on Numbers 12:5:3,"<b>Both of them went out.</b> Why did He draw them away and separate them from Moshe? Because we recite some of a person’s qualities in his presence, and all of them when he is not present. We find this about Noach. When he was not present it is said, “A righteous man, flawless,” but in his presence it is said, “For I have seen that you are righteous before Me.” Another interpretation: So that he should not hear Aharon’s rebuke.

Rashi on Numbers 12:8:2,"<b>In a vision, and not in riddles.</b> “In a vision” — this is the vision of the word, for I explain My word to him in the clearest form, I do not conceal it in riddles the way it was said to Yechezkel, “Present a riddle, etc.” Perhaps [this refers to] the vision of the Divine Presence? The Torah teaches, “you cannot see My Presence.” "
Rashi on Numbers 12:8:3,"<b>He gazes at the likeness of Adonoy.</b> This is the vision of the back, according to what is said, “But you may see what is behind Me.” 
"
Rashi on Numbers 12:8:4,"<b>About My servant, about Moshe.</b> It does not say, ‘about My servant Moshe,’ but ‘about My servant, about Moshe’ — about My servant, even if he were not Moshe, about Moshe, even if he were not My servant, It would have been appropriate for you to have been in awe of him. Certainly since he is My servant, and the king’s servant is [as] the king. You should have said, ‘The king does not love him gratuitously.’ And if you say that °I am not aware of his actions, then this (statement) is worse than the first! "
Rashi on Numbers 12:9:1,"<b>Adonoy’s anger flared against them and He left.</b> After He informed them of their reprehensible behavior, He decreed excommunication against them. Certainly a mortal, then, should not be angry with his fellow until he informs him of his reprehensible behavior. "
Rashi on Numbers 12:10:1,"<b>The cloud departed.</b> Afterward, “Behold, Miriam was leprous, like snow.” This is compared to a king who said to a pedagogue, ‘Punish my son, but do not punish him until I leave, as I pity him.’ "

Rashi on Numbers 12:12:2,"<b>Like the dead.</b> Since the leper is considered dead. °Just as the dead cause ritual defilement when entering [a room], so does the leper cause ritual defilement when entering. "
Rashi on Numbers 12:12:3,"<b>That, since he came from his mother’s womb.</b> “<i>Our</i> mother” should have been said, but Scripture euphemises. Similarly, “half his flesh” — “half <i>our</i> flesh” should have been said, but Scripture euphemises. That, since she came from our mother’s womb, [what] she [suffers] is ours, as if half our flesh were eaten away. This is similar to what is said, “for he is our brother, our flesh.” The simple interpretation also appears the same. °It is unconscionable for a brother to allow his sister to remain as if dead. "
Rashi on Numbers 12:12:4,"<b>That, since he came.</b> Since he [also] came from the mother’s womb of this one who has the power to help but does not, then half his own flesh is eaten away, as his brother, is his flesh. Another interpretation [of] “Please, let her not be like the dead.” If you do not heal her through prayer, °who will confine her, and who will purify her? I can not possibly examine her, as I am related, and a relative cannot examine the symptoms of leprosy. And there is no other <i>kohein</i> in the world. This is [what is meant by] “that, since he came from his mother’s womb.” "
Rashi on Numbers 12:13:1,"<b>Please, God, please heal her.</b> Scripture comes to teach proper behavior — that one who requests something from his fellow must say two or three words of supplication, then, afterward, make his requests. "

He (Moshe) said to Him, °‘Answer me, [as to] whether or not You will cure her’ — until He did answer, “If her father were to spit, etc.” R’ Elazar son of Azariah said, in four places, Moshe asked the Holy One, Blessed is He, that He answer him [as to] whether or not He would grant his requests. Similarly, “Moshe spoke before God, saying, etc.” What does the Torah teach by writing “saying”? ‘Answer me [as to] whether or not You will redeem them’ — until He did answer him, “Now you will see, etc.” Similarly, “Moshe spoke to God, saying, ‘let God, the God of the spirit of all flesh, appoint’.” He answered: “Take for you.” Similarly, “I pleaded with God at that time, saying.” He answered him, “Enough, for you.” "
Rashi on Numbers 12:13:3,"<b>Please heal her.</b> Why did not Moshe pray at length? So that the Israelites should not say, “His sister is suffering, and he stands and prolongs his prayer.” (Another interpretation: So that the Israelites should not say, For his sister he prays at length, but for us he does not pray at length). "
Rashi on Numbers 12:14:1,"<b>If (lit. “and”) her father were to spit in her face.</b> °If her father were to display, to her, an angry face, would she not be humiliated for seven days? °Certainly, then, in the case of the Divine Presence, [she should be humiliated] for fourteen days.

From there, they turned and proceeded along the entire western border by the seashore, until the entrance of Chamas, which is near Hor Hahar, at the northwestern corner, as the boundaries of the land are explicitly stated in the portion of “These are the journeys.” "

The Rabbis determined that each weighed forty <i>se’in,</i> and tradition teaches that the load a man can carry on his shoulder is only a third of the load he can carry when others assist him. "

This is [the meaning of] what is said, “on my day of reckoning — with the spies — I will take their sin into account.” Here, too, it is said, “you must bear your sins,” [plural] two sins, that of the calf, and that of the complaint.

Rashi on Numbers 15:18:1,"<b>At your coming to the land.</b> This “coming” is different from all the “comings” in the Torah.

Since Scripture specified with one of them that it is only after inheriting and settling, all of them are the same. But with this, it is said, “at your coming.” As soon as they entered it (the land) and ate its bread, they were obligated with the mitzvah of challah.

However, the sages required a specific amount: For the home maker, one twenty-fourth, for the commercial baker, one forty-eighth. "
Rashi on Numbers 15:21:1,"<b>Of the first portion of your doughs.</b> Why is this said? Because it says, “The first portion of your dough,” I would understand this as °the first of the loaves. The Torah therefore teaches, “of the first portion” — part of it, but not all of it. "
Rashi on Numbers 15:21:2,"<b>You shall give to Adonoy, as a terumah- offering.</b> As we have not heard of a specific amount for the <i>challah</i>-offering, it says, “you shall give” — it should consist of °an amount sufficient for “giving.” "
Rashi on Numbers 15:22:1,"<b>If you should err and not fulfill.</b> this refers to idol worship. which was categorized within all the commandments for which the community brings an ox, but Scripture here removes it from the category, °to indicate that it requires an ox as a burnt-offering, and a goat as a sin-offering. "
Rashi on Numbers 15:22:2,"<b>If you err, etc.</b> Scripture speaks here of idol worship. But perhaps it refers to one of all the [other] commandments? The Torah therefore teaches, “all of these commandments” — °a single commandment which is equivalent to all the commandments. Just as someone who transgresses all the commandments casts off the yoke, breaks the covenant, and brazenly defies [the Torah], so with [someone who transgresses] this commandment, he casts off the yoke, breaks the covenant, °and brazenly defies [the Torah]. Which is this? Idol worship. "

Rashi on Numbers 15:23:1,"<b>All that [Adonoy] commanded.</b> This teaches that if one admits to idolatry, it is as if he had denied the entire Torah, and all that the prophets prophesied, as it is said, “from the day that Hashem” commanded and onward.” "
Rashi on Numbers 15:24:1,"<b>If, it was obscured from the eyes of the congregation, having been done in error.</b> If, because of the seers of the community, this transgression was committed through error. [For example,] they erred, °and ruled that one of the forms of service is permitted for idol worship. "
Rashi on Numbers 15:24:2,"<b> לְחַטָּת, as a sin-offering.</b> The ‘ א ’ is missing, because this is not like the other sin-offerings. All of the sin-offerings in the Torah which are brought with an <i>olah</i>-offering, the sin-offering precedes the <i>olah,</i> as it is said, “he shall make the second one an <i>olah.</i>” But with this, the <i>olah</i> precedes the sin-offering.

Similarly, it says, “[As I live . . .] if I shall not, with a mighty hand . . . rule over you.” °Another interpretation. Why is the exodus from Egypt mentioned?

It is I who will distinguish, and punish those who attach [fringes dyed with] °indigo dye on their garments, and claim that it is the “<i>techeiles</i>” dye. From R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s commentary I transcribed: Why is the chapter of the “gatherer” adjacent to the chapter of idolatry? To teach that the Shabbos desecrator is like an idolator, since it (Shabbos), too, is equated with the entire Torah. This is stated in Ezra: “You descended on mount Sinai and gave Your nation the Torah and the commandments, etc., and You made Your sacred Shabbos known to them.” The portion of <i>tzitzis,</i> also for this reason, is adjacent to these [portions] — since it, too, is equivalent to all the commandments, as it is said, “you will perform all the commandments.” "
Rashi on Numbers 15:41:5,"<b>On the corners of their garments.</b> This corresponds with, “I carried you on the wings of eagles.” On the four corners — °but not on a garment with three, or with five [corners]. This corresponds with the four expressions of redemption which were stated in Egypt — “I will bring [you] out,” “I will save [you],” “I will redeem [you],” “I will take [you].” "
Rashi on Numbers 15:41:6,"<b>A thread of blue.</b> [תְּכֵלֶת] so named because of the [Egyptians’] loss of their firstborn. The targum — translation of שִׁכּוּל, “loss of a child,” is תִּכְלָא .

Rashi on Numbers 16:1:1,<b>Korach took.</b> °This passage is beautifully expounded by Midrash R’ Tanchuma.
Rashi on Numbers 16:1:2,"<b>Korach took.</b> He took himself to a different side, to be °disassociated from the community and to cast aspersion on the <i>kehunah</i>. This is why Onkelos translates וְאִתְפְּלֵג, he separated himself from the rest of the community in order to maintain the dispute. Similarly, “why does your heart take you?”— (i.e.,) it takes you to separate you from other people. °Another interpretation [of] “Korach took”: He won over the heads of the Sanhedrin among them, with flattering words, as it is said, “take Aharon,” “take words with you.” 
"
Rashi on Numbers 16:1:3,"<b>The son of Yitzhar, the son of Kehos, the son of Levi.</b> But °Scripture does not mention, “the son of Yaakov,” since he [Yaakov] implored [God] for compassion on himself that his name be omitted from their dispute, as it is said, “let my honor not be identified with their assembly.” °Where is his (Yaakov’s) name mentioned with Korach? At the genealogical identification [of the Levites] at the platform, in Divrei Hayamim, as it is said, “the son of Evyasaf, the son of Korach, the son of Yitzhar, the son of Kehos, the son of Levi, the son of Yisroel.” "
Rashi on Numbers 16:1:4,"<b>And Dasan and Aviram.</b> Because the tribe of Reuven made their camp at the south, °neighboring Kehos and his sons, who camped at the south, they joined Korach in his dispute. °”Woe to the wicked, woe to his neighbor”! °Why did Korach see fit to dispute Moshe? He envied °Elitzafan the son of Uziel for his leadership. Moshe appointed him leader over the sons of Kehos, by the word of God. Korach said, ‘Father had four brothers, as it is said: “The sons of Kehos, etc.” Amram was the firstborn. His two sons assumed great distinction — one (Moshe) is the monarch, the other (Aharon) the <i>Kohein Gadol</i>. Who should appropriately assume the second [position], if not I, the son of Yitzhar, second to Amram? Yet he appointed, as leader, the son of the youngest of all of his (Amram’s) brothers. I will oppose him, and nullify everything he said.’ What did he do? He rose up and gathered two hundred fifty heads of Sanhedrin, mostly from the neighboring tribe of Reuven — they were Elitzur the son of Shdeiur, and his companions, and the like, as it is said, “leaders of the congregation, who were called to meetings,” and it says above, °”those called from the congregation (leaders of their ancestral tribes).” He clothed them in °garments made completely of <i>techeiles.</i> They came and stood before Moshe and said to him: “Does a garment made completely of <i>techeiles</i> require <i>tzitzis,</i> or not?’ He said to them: “It is required.” They began scoffing at him. “How is it possible that a garment made of other material is absolved by a single thread of <i>techeiles,</i> yet one made completely of <i>techeiles</i> cannot absolve itself?” "
Rashi on Numbers 16:1:5,"<b>The sons of Reuvein.</b> °Dasan and Aviram, and On the son of Peles. "
Rashi on Numbers 16:3:1,<b>You have [taken] too much for yourselves.</b> °You have taken much more distinction for yourselves [than is appropriate].
Rashi on Numbers 16:3:2,"<b>Are all holy.</b> °They all heard the Word, at Sinai, from the mouth of the Almighty. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 16:3:3,"<b>Why do you raise yourselves.</b> °If you took the monarchy, you should not have chosen the <i>kehunah</i> for your brother. °You were not alone in hearing, at Sinai, “I am God your God”— the entire community heard. "
Rashi on Numbers 16:4:1,"<b>He fell upon his face.</b> °Because of the dispute, as this was, already, °their fourth despicable act. They sinned with the golden calf — “Moshe implored . . . “ With the complainers — “Moshe prayed . . .” With the spies — “Moshe said to God, If Egypt should hear. . .” At Korach’s dispute, his hands were weakened. This is compared to a prince who acted despicably against his father. His intimate friend placated him the first, second, and third times, but at the fourth despicable act, the friend’s hands were weakened. He said: “How long can I impose upon the king? Perhaps he will no longer receive me.” "
Rashi on Numbers 16:5:1,"<b>[In the] morning, [Adonoy] will make known.</b> °This is a time when we are intoxicated, and it would be improper [for us] to appear in His Presence. His intention was to delay, so that they might repent. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 16:5:2,"<b>[In the] morning, Adonoy will make known who is [qualified to be] His.</b> °For the Levite services. "
Rashi on Numbers 16:5:3,<b>And who is holy.</b> For the <i>kehunah</i>.
Rashi on Numbers 16:5:4,"<b>He will bring.</b> °Them close to Him. Targum [Onkelos] demonstrates this: “He will bring into His presence.” “He will bring into His service.” According to the Midrashic interpretation of “morning”: Moshe said to them, ‘God marked His universe with boundaries. Can you possibly transform morning into evening? that is how possible it is for you to nullify this, as it is said, “it became evening and it became morning, and He separated” Similarly, “Aharon was separated to be consecrated etc.” "
Rashi on Numbers 16:6:1,"<b>Do this: Take, for yourselves, fire pans.</b> Why did he see fit to tell them this? He said to them, “the gentile way is to have a variety of rituals, with many priests, [not all] gathered in one Temple. We have only one God, one Ark, one Torah, one Altar, and one <i>Kohein Gadol</i>. Yet you — two hundred and fifty men — seek the <i>kehunah Gedolah</i>! I, too, will acquiesce. Here you have the most precious service, the incense, more precious than all the sacrifices. But a deadly poison is placed in it, which consumed Nadav and Avihu.” He, therefore, warned them, “The man who will be chosen by Adonoy, he is the holy one.” He was already holy. Do we not know that the chosen one is holy? Rather, Moshe said to them, “I tell you this so that you will not be found guilty. The chosen one will survive, but all of you will be lost.” "
Rashi on Numbers 16:6:2,"<b>Fire pans.</b> Utensils for stoking coals, with a handle. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 16:7:1,"<b>You have taken [too] much upon yourselves, sons of Levi.</b> [I told you many things which are acceptable to the heart (i.e., reasonable). Another interpretation:] What I have said to you is a matter of great significance. Were they not fools, for he warned them, and yet they undertook to bring the offering? They sinned with their souls, as it is said, “the firepans of these sinners with their souls.” °But Korach who was astute, why did he see fit to engage in this foolishness? His vision deceived him. He saw a great dynasty descending from him — Shmuel, who was equal to Moshe and Aharon. He said, “for his sake, I will be spared.” And twenty four watches arising from his descendants, all prophesying by Divine inspiration, as it is said, “all of these were the sons of Heiman.” He said, “is it possible that all this greatness is destined to arise from me, and I shall remain silent”? This is why he participated, for, he had heard from Moshe’s mouth, that they would all be lost, but one would be spared: “The one whom God will choose, he is holy.” He mistakenly attributed this to himself, but his vision was flawed, as his sons repented. But Moshe saw. "
Rashi on Numbers 16:7:2,"<b>Too much upon yourselves</b> °You have undertaken a great task for yourselves to dispute the Holy One, Blessed is He. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 16:8:1,"<b>Moshe said to Korach, “Please listen, sons of Levi.”</b> He began speaking gently to him, but when he saw that he was stiff necked, he said, “before the other tribes join and are lost with him, I had better speak with all of them, too.” He began exhorting them, “please listen, sons of Levi.” "
Rashi on Numbers 16:9:1,<b>And to stand before the congregation.</b> To sing on the platform.
Rashi on Numbers 16:10:1,<b>He brought you near.</b> °To the service from which he distanced the rest of the community of Yisroel.
Rashi on Numbers 16:11:1,"<b>Therefore,</b> °Because of this, you, and your entire congregation who are gathered with you, have assembled against God, for I have acted as His representative in awarding the <i>kehunah</i> to Aharon. This quarrel is not with us. "
Rashi on Numbers 16:12:1,"<b>Moshe sent, etc.</b> From here [we derive] that one should not maintain a dispute, for Moshe sought them out in order to come to terms with them through a peaceful dialogue. "
Rashi on Numbers 16:12:2,"<b>We will not go up.</b> Their own words caused them to stumble — they will have nothing but a downfall. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 16:14:1,"<b>And [not] given us.</b> The statement relates to Gא (“not”), mentioned above, as if to say, “you have not brought us, and you have not given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. °You told us, ‘I will bring you up out of the suffering of Egypt to a good land . . . [flowing with milk and honey].’ You brought us out of there, but not to a land flowing with milk and honey did you bring us. Rather, you decreed, against us, that we die in the wilderness, as you said to us, ‘Your corpses will fall in this wilderness’.” 
"
Rashi on Numbers 16:14:2,"<b>If you put those people’s eyes out, etc.</b> °Even if you send agents to put our eyes out unless we go up to you, we will not go up. "
Rashi on Numbers 16:14:3,<b>Those people.</b> Like a man who attributes his own curse to someone else.
Rashi on Numbers 16:15:1,<b>Moshe was extremely distressed.</b> And Moshe was very grieved.
Rashi on Numbers 16:15:2,"<b>Do not turn to their offering.</b> According to the plain interpretation, [through] °the incense which they will offer before you tomorrow, do not turn to them. According to the Midrash, he said, “I know °that they have a portion in the continual communal sacrifices. Let their portion not be received by you favorably. Let the fire allow it to remain without consuming it.” "
Rashi on Numbers 16:15:3,"<b>Not a donkey did I sequester from any one of them.</b> I did not take a donkey from any °one of them. Even when I went from Midyan to Egypt and set my wife and sons on a donkey, when °I could have justifiably taken that donkey from them, I took only of my own. Onkelos translates שְׁחָרִית, “sequestered.” In Aramaic, the king’s service is called שַׁחְוַור . 
"
Rashi on Numbers 16:16:1,<b>And they.</b> °Your congregation.
Rashi on Numbers 16:17:1,<b>And you will offer before Adonoy each man his firepan.</b> The two hundred fifty men among you.
Rashi on Numbers 16:19:1,"<b>Korach congregated against them.</b> °With mockery. All that night he went to the tribes and enticed them. — “Do you think I am indignant for my sake alone? I am indignant only for the sake of all of you! They came and took all the great offices, the monarchy for himself, and the <i>kehunah</i> for his brother. . .,” until they were all convinced. "
Rashi on Numbers 16:19:2,"<b>The glory of Adonoy appeared.</b> °He came in the pillar of cloud. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 16:22:1,"<b>Almighty, the God of the spirits.</b> °Knower of thoughts. Your attributes are not like mortal attributes. A mortal king, against whom some of his kingdom acted scurrilously, does not know who the sinner is. Therefore, when he is angry, he punishes them all. But You — to You, all thoughts are revealed, and You know who the sinner is. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 16:22:2,"<b>If one man.</b> °Has sinned, will You <b>be angry with the entire congregation?</b> °The Holy One, Blessed is He, said: “You have spoken well. I know, and will make known, who sinned and who did not sin.”

Rashi on Numbers 16:22:3,
Rashi on Numbers 16:24:1,"<b>Depart (lit. go up).</b> As Targum [Onkelos] renders, (אִסְתַּלָּקוּ), °”depart,” from around Korach’s dwelling. "
Rashi on Numbers 16:25:1,"<b>Moshe rose up.</b> He thought they would treat him with regard, but they did not. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 16:27:1,"<b>Went out and stood.</b> °With a haughty bearing, to revile and blaspheme, °as “he stood disdainfully for forty days” [at the incident] of Golias. "
Rashi on Numbers 16:27:2,"<b>With their wives, children and infants.</b> Come, see °how inexorably destructive disputes are, for earthly tribunals do not mete out punishment until two pubic hairs have appeared, and the heavenly tribunal until twenty years, but here, even nursing infants perished. "
Rashi on Numbers 16:28:1,"<b>To perform all these deeds.</b> Which I have done by the word of God; °conferring the <i>kehunah Gedolah</i> on Aharon, [appointing] his sons as assistants, and Elitzafan as leader of the Kehosites. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 16:29:1,"<b>Adonoy has not sent me.</b> Rather, I did everything independently, and he (Korach) is justified in opposing me. "
Rashi on Numbers 16:30:1,<b>But if Adonoy will create a new creation. </b>
Rashi on Numbers 16:30:2," To kill them °with a death no one has ever experienced until now. What is this creation? “The earth will open its mouth and swallow them.” Then, you will know that they angered God, and I spoke according to the word of the Almighty. The Rabbis interpret, °‘if the mouth of the earth was created during the six days of creation, fine, but if not, let God it create [now]!’ "
Rashi on Numbers 16:30:3,
Rashi on Numbers 16:34:1,<b>Fled from their uproar.</b> Because of °the sound of the earth swallowing them up.
Rashi on Numbers 17:2:1,<b>And the fire.</b> °In the firepans.
Rashi on Numbers 17:2:2,"<b>Scatter yonder.</b> To the ground, °from the firepans. "
Rashi on Numbers 17:2:3,"<b>For, they were sanctified.</b> °The firepans, and may not be used for personal benefit, since they designated them as sacred service utensils. "
Rashi on Numbers 17:3:1,"<b>These sinners with their souls.</b> °They became willful sinners with their souls by disputing the Holy One, Blessed is He. "
Rashi on Numbers 17:3:2,<b>Hammered.</b> Beaten.
Rashi on Numbers 17:3:3,"<b>Sheets.</b> Hammered sheets. <i>Tendes,</i> “sheets,” in Old French. "
Rashi on Numbers 17:3:4,<b>To overlay the altar.</b> °The copper altar.
Rashi on Numbers 17:3:5,"<b>They shall be for a sign.</b> A reminder, so that they will say, “These belonged to the ones who disputed the <i>kehunah,</i> and were burned.” "
Rashi on Numbers 17:4:1,"<b>And hammered them.</b> <i>Atendirent,</i> “hammered” in Old French. "
Rashi on Numbers 17:5:1,<b>So as not to be like Korach.</b> °In order not to be like Korach.
Rashi on Numbers 17:5:2,"<b>As Adonoy spoke to him, through Moshe.</b> Like עָלָיו, “about him.” About Aharon, He spoke to Moshe, [saying] that he and his sons shall be <i>kohanim.</i> Therefore, a stranger should not approach who is not a descendant of Aharon, etc. Similarly, every לִי, לוֹ and לָהֶם next to דִּבּוּר, “speech,” is interpreted as עַל, “about.” According to Midrash, °about Korach, what is [the meaning of] בְּיַד משֶׁה, [literally “in the hand of Moshe,”] [why did] Scripture not write “to Moshe”? This alludes that those who dispute the <i>kehunah</i> °are stricken with <i>tzora'as,</i> as Moshe was stricken in his hand, as it is said, “when he withdrew it, his hand was stricken with <i>tzora’as</i> — white as snow.” This is why Uziyah was stricken with <i>tzora’as.</i> 
"
Rashi on Numbers 17:11:1,"<b>And atone for them.</b> This was the secret, the angel of death conveyed to him when he [Moshe] ascended to heaven, that incense holds back the plague, as stated in <i>Maseches</i> Shabbos. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 17:13:1,"<b>He stood between the dead etc.</b> °He grasped the angel and held him against his will. The angel said to him, “Permit me to perform my duty.” He said to him, “Moshe ordered me to stop you.” He said to him, “I represent God, while you represent Moshe.” He said to him, “Moshe says nothing of his own volition, only from the mouth of the Almighty. If you don’t believe me — why the Holy One, Blessed is He, and Moshe are at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. Come with me and ask.” This is [the meaning of] what is said — Aharon returned to Moshe. °Another interpretation: Why with incense? Because the Israelites were grumbling, and vilifying the incense, saying that it was a deadly poison — because of it, Nadav and Avihu died, because of it, two hundred and fifty men were consumed. The Holy One, Blessed is He, said, ‘You will see that it [incense] halts the plague — it is sinfulness, that kills.’ 
"
Rashi on Numbers 17:18:1,"<b>For, [there is] one staff.</b> Although I divided them into two family groups, the <i>kehunah</i> family separately, and the Levite separately, still, they are a single tribe. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 17:20:1,"<b>And I will abate.</b> Like “the waters abated,” “the king’s rage abated.” "
Rashi on Numbers 17:21:1,"<b>Among their staffs.</b> He placed it °in the middle, so that they would not claim that, because he placed it near the Divine Presence, it flowered. "
Rashi on Numbers 17:23:1,<b>Blossomed.</b> Like the plain interpretation.
Rashi on Numbers 17:23:2,"<b>Buds.</b> This refers to the budding of the fruit, °when the blossoms drop. "
Rashi on Numbers 17:23:3,"<b>And bore ripe almonds.</b> When the fruit was discernible, it was recognized as almonds, as in “the child grew and was weaned.” This term is generally used for fruit of the tree, as in “its buds will become ripening fruit.” °Why almonds? This is the fruit which blossoms more quickly than all fruits. One who callenges the <i>kehunah</i> as well, will be punished quickly, as we find with Uzyah, “the <i>tzora’as</i> emanated from his forehead.” Targum [Onkelos] renders, “it clustered almonds” — a sort of almond cluster, bunched together with each other. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 17:25:1,"<b>To be preserved as symbol.</b> Of °remembrance that I chose Aharon to serve as <i>kohein,</i> so that they will never again dispute the <i>kehunah</i>. "
Rashi on Numbers 17:25:2,"<b>So that their complaint will end.</b> Like וּתְכַלֶּה תְלוּנּוֹתָם, ‘their’ complaint will end. This term is a singular, °feminine verbal noun, like תְּלוּנָּתָם . <i>murmur-diz,</i> “complaint” in Old French. There is a distinction between תְּלוּנּוֹתָם and תְּלוּנָּתָם . תְּלוּנָּתָם, a single complaint. תְּלוּנּוֹתָם, a singular noun, even when there are many complaints. "
Rashi on Numbers 17:28:1,"<b>Anyone approaching who comes close, etc.</b> We cannot take precautions against this. We are all permitted to enter °the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting. And anyone who advances further than his fellows, and enters into the Tent of Meeting, will die. "
Rashi on Numbers 17:28:2,<b>Have we been consigned to death?</b> Perhaps °we have been abandoned to die?
Rashi on Numbers 18:1:1,"<b>Adonoy said to Aharon.</b> He told Moshe °to say to Aharon, To exhort him concerning [precautions] for the benefit of the Israelites, so that they do not enter the Sanctuary. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:1:2,"<b>You, your sons, and your father’s house.</b> °The children of Kehos, Amram’s father. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:1:3,"<b>Will bear the sin of the Sanctuary.</b> I am casting, upon you, the punishment of the unauthorized persons who sin by their involvement with the sacred objects placed in your charge — the Tent, Ark, Table, and sacred vessels. You must station yourselves and warn every unauthorized person who attempts contact. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:1:4,<b>And you and your sons.</b> The <i>kohanim.</i>
Rashi on Numbers 18:1:5,"<b>Will bear the sin of your <i>kehunah</i>.</b> Since it is not a charge given to the Levites, you must warn the erring Levites not to come in contact with you during your service. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:2:1,"<b>Also, your brothers.</b> The sons of Gershon and the sons of Merori. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:2:2,<b>They shall join you.</b> They shall unite with you °in also warning the unauthorized persons not to approach them.
Rashi on Numbers 18:2:3,"<b>And serve you.</b> By guarding the gateways, and through the appointment, from them, of custodians and °administrators. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:4:1,<b>A commonor should not approach you.</b> °I admonish you about this.
Rashi on Numbers 18:5:1,"<b>So that there will be no more wrath.</b> °As there already was, as it is said, “for the wrath has surfaced.” "
Rashi on Numbers 18:6:1,"<b>Given to you as a gift.</b> °Perhaps for your personal, secular service? The Torah, therefore, teaches, “for God,” as specified above, to attend to the mandate — custodians and administrators. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:7:1,<b>The service as a gift.</b> I have given it to you °as a gift.
Rashi on Numbers 18:8:1,"<b>Behold, I have given you.</b> With joy. °This term denotes joy, as in, “behold, he is going out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will rejoice in his heart.” This is compared to a king who gave a property to his intimate friend, but did not write and sign a deed, or register it with the authorities. Someone came and claimed the property. The king said to him: “Whoever wishes will come and claim against you. Behold, I will write and sign a deed to you, and register it with the authorites.” Here, too, because Korach came and claimed the <i>kehunah</i> from Aharon, Scripture °presents him with twenty-four <i>kehunah</i> gifts, with the eternal covenant of salt. This is why this chapter was placed here. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:8:2,<b>The guarding of my <i>terumah</i>-gifts.</b> Which you must °guard in ritual purity.

Rashi on Numbers 18:9:4,<b>Which they return to Me.</b> °This refers to the proselyte’s stolen property.
Rashi on Numbers 18:10:1,"<b>You shall eat it in the supremely holy.</b> This teaches that the supremely holy offerings °may be eaten only in the Sanctuary courtyard, and by the male <i>kohanim.</i>

Rashi on Numbers 18:11:2,<b>Of all of the wave-offerings.</b> Since these require waving.
Rashi on Numbers 18:11:3,<b>All those ritually pure.</b> °But not those ritually defiled. °Another interpretation of “all those ritually pure” — to include his wife.
Rashi on Numbers 18:12:1,"<b>Their <i>terumah</i>-gift.</b> This refers to the major <i>terumah</i>-gift. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 18:18:1,"<b>Like the breast which is waved and like the right thigh.</b> Of the peace-offering, which are eaten by the <i>kohanim,</i> and their wives, children, and servants, for two days and one night. °The firstborn [animal], also, is eaten for two days and one night. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:18:2,"<b>It shall be yours.</b> °R’ Akiva came, and expounded: Scripture adds an additional “being,” so that you should not say, “like the breast and thigh of the thanksgiving-offering, which is only eaten for a day and a night.” "
Rashi on Numbers 18:19:1,"<b>All of the sacred <i>terumah</i>-gifts.</b> Because this <i>parashah</i> is precious, it is generalized at the beginning, generalized at the end, and detailed in between. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:19:2,"<b>An eternal covenant of salt.</b> He made a covenant with Aharon with a robust, enduring object which invigorates others. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:19:3,"<b>A covenant of salt.</b> Like the covenant made with salt, which never spoils.

Rashi on Numbers 18:23:1,"<b>They.</b> °The Levites will bear the sins of the Israelites, since it is incumbent upon them to warn unauthorized persons against approaching them. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:24:1,Which they must set aside to Adonoy as a <i>terumah</i>-gift. °Scripture calls it “a <i>terumah</i>-gift” until he separates the <i>terumah</i> of the tithe from it.
Rashi on Numbers 18:27:1,"<b>Your terumah-gift will be considered the same as grain from the granary.</b> The <i>terumah</i> of your tithe is prohibited to unauthorized persons and to the ritually unclean, and they are liable to the death penalty, and to the additional fifth, °like the major <i>terumah</i>- gift, which is called the first portion of grain from the granary. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:27:2,<b>And [wine and oil of] fully ripened fruit from the cistern.</b> The <i>terumah</i>-gift of wine and oil taken from the cisterns.
Rashi on Numbers 18:27:3,<b>Fully ripened fruit (lit. full).</b> The term denotes ripeness. Full produce.
Rashi on Numbers 18:27:4,"<b>Cistern.</b> This refers to the pit before the press, wherein the wine flows. The word יֶקֶב always denotes an excavation of earth. Similarly, “the king’s cisterns,” referring to the sea of Okiyanus, an excavation dug by the King of the universe. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:28:1,"<b>So must you, too, set aside.</b> Just as the Israelites set aside from their granaries and cisterns, so must you, too, from your tithe, since that is your inheritance. "
Rashi on Numbers 18:29:1,"<b>From all of your gifts you must set aside all of the terumah-gifts of Adonoy.</b> Scripture speaks of °major <i>terumah,</i> [teaching] that if the Levite pre-empted the <i>kohein</i> at the storage bin, and received his tithes before the <i>kohein</i> took the major <i>terumah</i> from the storage bin, the Levite must first set aside one fiftieth of the tithe as major <i>terumah,</i> and then return and set aside the <i>terumah</i> of the tithe.

Rashi on Numbers 18:30:1,<b>When you set aside the finest part of it.</b> °After you set aside the <i>terumah</i> of the tithe from it.
Rashi on Numbers 18:30:2,<b>It will be considered.</b> °What remains for the Levites [will be considered] completely secular.
Rashi on Numbers 18:30:3,"<b>Like the produce of the granary.</b> To the Israelite. °So that you should not say, since the Torah calls it “<i>terumah,</i>” as it is said, “for the Israelites’ tithe which they set aside for God as a <i>terumah</i>-gift,” perhaps it is completely forbidden. The Torah therefore teaches, “It will be considered, for the Levites, like the produce of the granary.” Just as that of the Israelite is secular, so is that of the Levite secular.

Rashi on Numbers 19:9:2,"<b>For sprinkling water.</b> For water of sprinkling, similar to, “they cast a stone at me,” “to cast away the horns of the nations,” meaning to throw. "
Rashi on Numbers 19:9:3,"<b>For purification.</b> °The word denotes cleansing, like its plain meaning. °In its halachic sense, however, Scripture entitles it חַטָּאת, “sin-offering,” to teach that it is like a sacred object, and thus prohibited from personal benefit.

Rashi on Numbers 19:15:1,"<b>Any open utensil.</b> Scripture refers to °an earthen utensil, which does not admit ritual contamination from its outside, but from its inside. Thus, if its seal is not properly and securely fastened, it is defiled, but if there is a seal fastened to it, it is pure. "
Rashi on Numbers 19:15:2,"<b>Fastened.</b> °The word denotes attachment in Arabic. Similarly, “I have been joined by Godly bonds”— I have been joined to my sister. "
Rashi on Numbers 19:16:1,"<b>In an open field.</b> The Rabbis extrapolate, this includes °the “<i>gollel</i>” and “<i>dofek.</i>” Its plain meaning is that in the open field, where there is no tent, the corpse conveys defilement through touching.

Rashi on Numbers 19:20:1,"<b>A person who became ritually unclean, etc.</b> If “<i>Mikdash</i>” was said, °why was “<i>Mishkon</i>” said?. . .etc., as stated in tractate Shevuos. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 19:21:1,"<b>One who sprinkles the sprinkling waters.</b> The Rabbis say °that the sprinkler is actually pure, and that this teaches °that one who carries the purifying water becomes extremely defiled, so as to contaminate the garments he wears, unlike one who touches [the water]. The reason it is expressed as “the sprinkler” is to teach that they (the waters) do not defile unless they contain a sufficient amount for sprinkling. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 19:21:2,"<b>One who touches, etc. shall remain unclean.</b> °But his garments do not require ritual washing. "
Rashi on Numbers 19:22:1,"<b>Anything which the unclean person touches.</b> °[Which] this person who was defiled by a corpse [touches], shall become unclean. "
Rashi on Numbers 19:22:2,"<b>And anyone touching.</b> Him, °the one defiled by the corpse. "
Rashi on Numbers 19:22:3,"<b>Shall be ritually unclean until evening.</b> Here we learn that a corpse is a “forefather” of defilement, and whoever touches it is the “father” of defilement, and defiles another person. This is the explanation according to its plain meaning and its halachic ramifications. Now I have transcribed the Midrash Aggadah from R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s basic commentary, as follows: "
Rashi on Numbers 19:22:4,"<b>They shall take to you.</b> From their own. Just as they removed the golden rings, for the [golden] calf, from their own, so shall they bring this from their own as atonement. "
Rashi on Numbers 19:22:5,"<b>A red cow.</b> This is compared to the child of a maidservant who sullied the king’s palace. They said, “let the child’s mother come and wipe away the filth.” Similarly, °let the cow come and atone for the calf. "
Rashi on Numbers 19:22:6,<b>Red.</b> To correspond with “If they [your sins] are as red as crimson. . .” Sin is described as red.

Rashi on Numbers 19:22:9,"<b>To Elozor the kohein.</b> Just as they gathered against Aharon, the <i>kohein, [and forced him] to construct the calf. And since Aharon constructed the calf, this service was not performed by him, for, the accuser cannot serve as the defender. </i>"
Rashi on Numbers 19:22:10,<b>[He] shall burn the cow.</b> Just as the calf was burned.
Rashi on Numbers 19:22:11,"<b>Cedar wood, hyssop, and crimson wool.</b> These three species correspond with the three thousand men who perished because of the calf. The cedar is the loftiest of all trees, the hyssop the lowest of all, signifying that someone haughty who sinned with arrogance must humble himself like the hyssop and the worm to gain atonement. "
Rashi on Numbers 19:22:12,"<b>A keepsake.</b> Just as the transgression of the calf, which is preserved throughout the generations for punishment, as there is no reckoning which does not include an accounting for the calf, as it is said, “on the day of my reckoning, I will take into account . . .

Rashi on Numbers 20:1:3,"<b>Miriam died there.</b> She, too, died °by the Divine kiss. °Why, then, is it not said, concerning her, “by the mouth of God”?

Rashi on Numbers 20:10:2,"<b>Can we extract from this rock?</b> °Because they did not recognize it, as the rock settled itself among the other rocks when the well departed. The Israelites were telling them, “What [difference] is it to you, from which rock you extract water for us”? This is why he addressed them as “rebels “—”insolents,” “fools” in Greek.

Rashi on Numbers 20:11:1,"<b>Twice.</b> °Because at first, it only produced drops, since the Omnipresent had not commanded to strike it, but “speak to the rock.” They spoke to a different rock, but it did not produce. They said, “perhaps it must be struck, like the first one,” as it is said, “strike the rock.” Then they happened upon that rock and he struck it. "
Rashi on Numbers 20:12:1,"<b>Because you did not believe in Me.</b> °Scripture reveals that °if it had not been for this single sin, they would have entered the land, so that it would not be said of them: °”Like the transgressions of the rest of the generation of the desert, against whom it was decreed not to enter the land— so was the transgression of Moshe and Aharon.” But °was not [the transgression implied in the verse] “will sheep and cattle be slaughtered”? worse than this? Still, because it was said in private, Scripture was compassionate with him, but here, where it was in the presence of all of Israel, Scripture was not compassionate with him, because of the sanctification of the Name. "
Rashi on Numbers 20:12:2,"<b>To sanctify me.</b> For, if you had spoken to the rock and it had brought forth water, I would have been sanctified in the eyes of the community. They would have said: “Now this rock, which can neither speak nor hear, and does not require sustenance, fulfills the word of the Omnipresent. How much more should we do so.” "
Rashi on Numbers 20:12:3,"<b>Therefore, you will not bring.</b> This was said as an oath, like “Therefore, I swore to the house of Eili.” °He swore precipituously, so that they would not engage in lengthy prayer. "
Rashi on Numbers 20:13:1,"<b>They are the waters of dispute.</b> They are the ones mentioned elsewhere. Pharaoh’s astrologers saw them, [seeing] that the saviour of Israel would be smitten through water. Therefore, they decreed that “every boy who is born must be thrown into the river.” "
Rashi on Numbers 20:13:2,"<b>He was sanctified through them.</b> Since Moshe and Aharon died because of them. When the Holy One, Blessed is He, administers judgment against His holy ones, He is feared and sanctified by mankind.

Rashi on Numbers 20:14:1,"<b>Your brother Yisroel.</b> Why did Moshe see fit to mention brotherhood here? But he said to him, “We are brothers, children of Avrohom, to whom it was said, ‘[Know] . . . that your descendants will be strangers [in a land that is not theirs]’, and we were both responsible for fulfilling that obligation.” "
Rashi on Numbers 20:14:2,"<b>You know of all the hardship.</b> Therefore, your father parted from our father, as it is said, “he went to a land because of his brother Yaakov” — °because of the bill of debt incumbent upon them, he placed the burden on Yaakov.

Rashi on Numbers 20:17:2,"<b>We will not drink well water.</b> It should have said, “cistern water.” But this is what Moshe said: °”Although we have in our possession manna to eat and the well [water] to drink, we will not drink from it, but we will buy food and drink from you, for your benefit.” From here [we derive] that, although a guest has provisions in his possession, he should buy from the shopkeeper, in order to benefit his host.

Rashi on Numbers 20:23:1,"<b>At the border of the land of Edom.</b> This teaches, that because they joined here in associating with the evil Eisav, a breach was made in their activities, and they lost this righteous man.

Rashi on Numbers 20:29:3,"<b>That [Aharon] died.</b> I say that anyone who translates [כִּי גָוַע as] דְּהָא מִית (“because [Aharon] died”), is mistaken, unless he also translates וַיִּרְאוּ as וְאִתְחֲזִיאוּ ([The community] “was exposed”). Since the Rabbis’ comment, that כִּי here is understood as “because,” is valid only according to the Midrashic comment that the clouds of glory departed, as R’ Abohu said, “do not read וַיִּרְאוּ (‘they [the community] saw,’), but וַיֵּרָאוּ, (‘they [the community] were exposed’).” According to this interpretation, דְּהָא (“because”), is the proper usage, since it clarifies what precedes it. Why were they exposed? Because Aharon died. However, according to Targum [Onkelos who translates] “the entire community saw,” “because” is not the proper usage, but “that,” from the אִי meaning, as we find אִם meaning “that.” As in, “that [I ask], why shouldn’t I be distressed”?Sf? and many clear usages in this sense, [like] “that his days are designated.” "
Rashi on Numbers 21:1:1,"<b>The Canaanite heard.</b> °He heard that Aharon died, and the clouds of glory departed, etc. as stated in Rosh Hashanah. Amelek was always a whip for disciplining Israel, prepared, at all times, to mete out punishment.

The Israelites saw that they were dressed in Amalekite clothing, but spoke the Canaanite tongue.

There, Aharon died.” Was it in Moseirah that Aharon died? Did he not die at Mount Hor? °But they returned there, and mourned and eulogized him as if he were in their presence.

Rashi on Numbers 21:4:3,"<b>Traveling was insufferable to the people (lit. “the people’s souls did not have the capacity for traveling”).</b> Because of the rigors of travel, which were overly difficult for them. They said, “We were just close to entering the land, and we are turning back. This was how our fathers turned back, and they remained for thirty-eight years, until this day.” Therefore, the distress of traveling was insufferable. “<i>Encrot lor</i>” [“repulsive to them”, in old French]. But it would be improper to translate “the people experienced insufferability בַּדֶּרֶךְ, while traveling,” without specification of the cause of the insufferability; since, wherever one finds insufferability in Scripture, the cause is specified. For example, “they were insufferable to me.” And, for example, “Israel’s distress was insufferable to him.” Anything overly difficult for a person is depicted as קִצּוּר נֶפֶשׁ (lit. the incapacity of the soul), like a person beset by travail, who lacks the breadth of mind to accept that, and who does not have a place in his heart where the distress might reside. Now, the thing causing distress is depicted as looming large, since it is seems large and weighs heavily on the person. For example, “their souls loomed over me” —seemed large to me. [And, for example,] “Trapping me like a lion looms large.” The synopsis of the interpretation: Every statement expressing the soul’s incapacity for a thing means that it cannot tolerate it, for the mind cannot tolerate it.

Although Moshe did not state this clearly, Yiftach did, as was said by Yiftach, “he (Moshe) also sent [a request] to the king of Moav, but he was unwilling.” Moshe alluded to this: “Just as they did to me, the children of Eisav, who dwell in Seir, and the Moavites, who dwell in Ar,” Just as these [children of Eisav] did not permit them to pass through their land, but they circled around them, so it was with Moav.

The cliffs were near each other— a man could stand on one of them, and converse with a friend on the other— and the road went through the valley. The Emorites said, “When the Israelites enter the valley to pass through, let us go out of the caves in the cliffs above them, and kill them with arrows and stone projectiles.” Now those cavities were in the mountain on the Moavite side, and in the mountain on the side of the Emorites, opposite the cavities, were horn-like projections, resembling breasts. °When the Israelites came to pass through, the Eretz Yisroel mountain was set in tremor like a maidservant going forth to receive her mistress, and moved next to the mountain on the Moavite side. The breasts entered the cavities and killed them. this is [the meaning of] “when it turned to dwell at Ar,” as the mountain leaned away from its place, and moved next to the side of the Moavite border, and attached itself to it.

"
Rashi on Numbers 21:20:1,"<b>From the heights to the valley in the field of Moav.</b> °As there Moshe died, °and there the well was discontinued. Another interpretation of “The nobles of the nation excavated”: Each tribal leader, when they encamped, took his staff and drew it to his banner and camp. The well water followed the path made by that mark, and reached each the camp of each tribe. "
Rashi on Numbers 21:20:2,"<b>Through the lawgiver.</b> Through Moshe, who was called the lawgiver, as it is said, “for there, the portion of the lawgiver is reserved.” °Why is Moshe not mentioned in this song? Because he was afflicted through the well. And since Moshe’s name is not mentioned, the Name of the God, is not mentioned. This is compared to a king who was invited to a banquet. he said, ‘If my intimate friend is there, I will be there, but if not, I will not go.’ "
Rashi on Numbers 21:20:3,"<b>At the top of the peak.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] translates, “the top of the height.” "
Rashi on Numbers 21:20:4,"<b>The peak.</b> This denotes a high point. Similarly, פַּסְּגוּ אַרְמְנוֹתֶיהָ —”raise its castles.” 
"
Rashi on Numbers 21:20:5,"<b>That overlooks.</b> °That peak, facing the place called Yeshimon. The word [Yeshimon] denotes a wilderness, a desolate place. °Another interpretation: The well may be seen on the face of the desolate place. It (the well) was hidden in the sea of Teveriah, and someone standing on the desolate place may look intently and observe a type of sieve in the sea— this is the well. This was expounded by R’ Tanchuma. "
Rashi on Numbers 21:21:1,"<b>Yisroel sent emissaries.</b> But elsewhere, the communication is attributed to Moshe, as it is said, “I sent emissaries from the eastern wilderness.” Similarly, “Moshe sent emissaries from Kadesh to the king of Edom”, but about Yiftach it says, “Israel sent emissaries to the king of Edom, etc.” These passages are mutually instructive, one closes, while the other opens. Moshe is Yisroel, Yisroel is Moshe, to teach you that the leader of the generation is like the entire generation. The leader is everything. "
Rashi on Numbers 21:22:1,"<b>Let me pass through your land.</b> °Although they were not commanded to offer a peace overture, they made a peaceful proposal. "

Rashi on Numbers 21:23:2,"<b>And [he] went out against Israel.</b> If Cheshbon had been filled with gnats, no creature could have conquered it. And if Sichon had been in a feeble village, no man could have conquered him, And certainly, since he was in Cheshbon. The Holy One, Blessed is He, said, °”Why should I incovenience My children with all this besieging of every single city”? He prompted all the warriors into deciding to leave the cities, and they all gathered in one place, where they were slain. From there, the Israelites went to the cities without opposition, since no one was there, except the women and children. "

Rashi on Numbers 21:26:1,"<b>He had waged war.</b> Why was it necessary for this to have been written? Because it is said, “do not oppress Moav,” and Cheshbon belonged to Moav. Scripture [therefore] writes, for us, that Sichon confiscated it from them, and it was purified for Israel through him. "

Rashi on Numbers 21:30:2,"<b>Was uprooted from Cheshbon, as far as Divon.</b> The kingdom and authority Moav had in Cheshbon, was uprooted from there. Similarly, °”as far as Divon.” The Targum of סָר, “was removed,” is עַד .

Rashi on Numbers 21:30:3,"<b>We made them desolate.</b> The שִׁ""ין is punctuated, denoting desolation. This is what the parable tellers said: וַנַּשִּׁים אוֹתָם עַד נֹפַח, “We made them desolate until Nofach.”

Rashi on Numbers 21:34:1,"<b>Do not be afraid of him.</b> °Moshe was afraid to do battle, for perhaps, the merit of Avrohom, would stand for him [Og] as it is said, “the one who had escaped came.” This was Og, who escaped, of the Rephaim whom Kedorlaomer and his cohorts smote in Ashteros Karnayim, as it is said, “for only Og, king of Bashan, was left of the remaining Rephaim.” "

Rashi on Numbers 22:4:1,"<b>To the elders of Midian.</b> °But were they not ancient enemies, as it is said, “who attacked Midian in the field of Moav,” when Midian went to war against Moav? Still, because of their fear of Yisroel, they made peace. But °why did Moav see fit to accept advice from Midian? When they saw the supernatural victories of Yisroel, they said, “Their leader was raised in Midian. Let us ask them what his character is.” They told them: “He has no power, except with the mouth.” They said, “We, too, will confront them with a man whose power is with his mouth.” "

Rashi on Numbers 22:5:2,"<b>The land of his people.</b> Balak’s — he came from there. This person (Bil’am) °prophesied, and said to him, “You are destined to be a king.” °Should you ask, why did the Holy One, Blessed is He, visit His Divine Presence on an evil gentile? So that the nations might not extenuate themselves by saying, “If we had prophets, we would have repented.” He established prophets for them, and they breached a universal barrier; they had originally refrained from promiscuity, but this person (Bil’am) advised them to indulge freely in promiscuity.

Rashi on Numbers 22:7:1,"<b>With magic chas in their hands.</b> °All types of magic charms, so that he could not say, “My tools are not with me.” Another interpretation. The elders of Midian took up this mystical omen: They said, “If he comes with us this time, there is something to him; but if he rebuffs us, it is useless.” This is why, when he said to them, “Spend the night here,” they said, “It is hopeless.” They left him there and departed, as it is said, “the Moavite chieftains stayed with Bil’am,” °but the elders of Midian departed.

Rashi on Numbers 22:8:1,"<b>Spend this night here.</b> The Sacred spirit visits him only at night. It is the same with all of the gentile prophets, and it was the same with Lavan — in a dream at night, as it is said, “God appeared to Lavan the Aramean in a dream that night,” like a man who visits his concubine secretly.

Rashi on Numbers 22:12:2,
Rashi on Numbers 22:13:1,"<b>To go with you.</b> But with higher ranking officials than you. °We learn that he was arrogant, and was unwilling to reveal that he was under God’s domination, except in insolent terms. Therefore, “Balak persisted. . .”

Rashi on Numbers 22:21:1,"<b>[He] saddled his donkey.</b> From here [we derive] that hatred breeds impropriety — °he saddled it himself. The Holy One, Blessed is He, said, “Evil one, their patriarch Avrohom has already preceded you”! as it is said: “Avrohom rose early and saddled his donkey.” "
Rashi on Numbers 22:21:2,<b>With the Moavite dignitaries.</b> His heart (intent) was exactly the same as theirs.

Rashi on Numbers 22:23:1,"<b>The donkey saw.</b> But he [Bilam] did not see, for the Holy One, Blessed is He, granted an animal greater perception than a man, who, because of his intelligence, would become deranged from the perception of destructive spirits.

Rashi on Numbers 22:29:2,"<b>Would that I had a sword in my hand.</b> °This matter was extremely disparaging for him in the eyes of the dignitaries. This man is en route to kill an entire nation verbally, yet, for this donkey, he requires weapons of war! "
Rashi on Numbers 22:30:1,"<b>Was it ever my habit.</b> This follows Targum [Onkelos]. Similarly, “does man benefit God by learning”?

Similarly, “you shall kill the woman and the animal.” Similarly, “kill the animal.” "
Rashi on Numbers 22:34:1,"<b>Because I did not know.</b> This, too, was disparaging, but he was forced to concede. He had boasted that he could divine the thoughts of Heaven, but his own mouth bore witness, “I did not know.” "
Rashi on Numbers 22:34:2,"<b>If it is wicked in your eyes, I shall return.</b> This reply was °an attack against the Omnipresent. He (Bil’am) said to him, “He Himself commanded me to go, yet you, an angel, are nullifying His words. This is customary with Him — He says something, and an angel withdraws it.

Rashi on Numbers 23:18:2,"<b>Son of (lit. his son) Tzipor.</b> This is a Scriptural usage, like “beasts (lit. his beasts) of the forest,” “beasts (lit. his beasts) of the earth,” “into a spring (lit. his spring) of water.” "
Rashi on Numbers 23:19:1,"<b>God is not like man, etc.</b> He has already sworn to them to bring them and give them possession of the land of the seven nations, and you think that you can kill them in the wilderness? "
Rashi on Numbers 23:19:2,"<b>Would He say, etc.</b> °The word denotes a question. Targum [Onkelos] translates “who retract and reconsider” — °they retract, then reconsider whether to change their minds. "
Rashi on Numbers 23:20:1,"<b>Behold I was commanded to bless.</b> You ask me, “what has God said”? °I have received [instructions] from Him to bless them. <b>[Bless.</b> Similar “to bless.”]"
Rashi on Numbers 23:20:2,"<b>[When] He has blessed, I cannot reverse it.</b> He has blessed them, °and I will not reverse his blessing. "
Rashi on Numbers 23:20:3,"<b>He has blessed.</b> As if it were וּבִרֵךְ . This is how the letter ר is conjugated, like אוֹיֵב חֵרֵף, as if it were חִרֵף . Similarly, וּבֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ One who lauds and blesses the thief, saying “have no fear, you will not be punished, you will be at peace,” angers the Holy One, Blessed is He. But one cannot say that בֵּרֵךְ is a noun, for if so, it would be vocalized with a minor <i>patach</i> [<i>segol,</i> בֶּרֶךְ], with the accent above. However, because it connotes action, it is vocalized with a minor <i>komatz</i> [<i>tzayreh,</i> בֵּרֵךְ], with the accent below. "
Rashi on Numbers 23:20:4,
Rashi on Numbers 23:21:1,"<b>One does not see evildoers in Yaakov.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] renders. Another interpretation: By following its plain meaning, it may be expounded beautifully. The Holy One, Blessed is He, does not look at the evil in Yaakov. When they transgress His commandments, He does not pursue them exactingly by reflecting on °the wickedness and wrongdoing of their violation of His doctrines. "
Rashi on Numbers 23:21:2,
Rashi on Numbers 23:21:3,"<b>Transgression.</b> The word [עמל, (lit. tediousness)] denotes sin, as in “sin conceives,” “for you observe sinful and infuriating behaviour.” Because sinfulness is tedious before the Omnipresent. "
Rashi on Numbers 23:21:4,"<b>Adonoy, his God, is with him.</b> Even when they anger Him and are rebellious, He does not leave them. "
Rashi on Numbers 23:21:5,"<b>He has the King’s friendship.</b> The word denotes affection and friendship, like “David’s comrade” — one who loves David, “and he gave it to his fellow.” Similarly, Onkelos renders “the King’s Presence is among them.” "
Rashi on Numbers 23:22:1,"<b>God Who has brought them out of Egypt.</b> You said, “behold, a nation came out of Egypt” — they did not leave by themselves, God delivered them. "
Rashi on Numbers 23:22:2,"<b>Has shown His great strength to them.</b> °Like the power of His loftiness and elevation. Similarly, “and silver [shall be your] strength.” It denotes strength. Now I say that the word [תּוֹעֲפֹת] is from וְעוֹף יְעוֹפֵף. (“and let birds fly,”) someone who flies to a lofty elevation — °this is a great application of power. וְתוֹעֲפֹת רְאֵם, lofty flight. Another interpretation [of] תוֹעֲפֹת רְאֵם, “the power of the <i>re’emim.</i>” The Rabbis explain that °this refers to the demons and evil spirits. "
Rashi on Numbers 23:22:3,
Rashi on Numbers 23:23:1,"<b>For there is no sorcery in Yaakov.</b> For they deserve to be blessed, since there are no sorcerers or magicians among them. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 23:23:2,"<b>In due time, it will be said to Yaakov, etc.</b> There is destined °to be another time such as this, when their preciousness will be revealed before everyone’s eyes, °for they will be seated before Him studying the Torah from His mouth, and their partition will be further within, than the administering angels, who will ask them, “What has God done”? This is [the meaning of] what is said, “your eyes shall behold your master.” Another interpretation: יֵאָמֵר לְיַעֲקֹב does not refer to the future, but to the present. They have no need for magicians and sorcerers, for at any time when it is necessary that Yaakov and Yisroel be told what the Holy One, Blessed is He, has done, and what He has decreed on high, they do not perform magic or sorcery. °Rather, they are told through their prophets what the Omnipresent’s decree is, or, the <i>Urim</i> and <i>Tummim</i> informs them. Onkelos, however, does not interpret this way. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 23:24:1,"<b>Behold, a people that rises like a young lion, etc.</b> When they rise from their slumber in the morning, they are as vigorous as the young lion and the lion, to snatch the <i>mitzvos</i> wearing a <i>Tallis,</i> reading the <i>Shema,</i> and putting on the <i>Tefillin.</i> "
Rashi on Numbers 23:24:2,"<b>He does not lie down.</b> At night on his bed °until he consumes and destroys every harmful spirit which comes to attack him. How is this? He reads the bedtime <i>Shema,</i> and entrusts his soul in the hand of the Omnipresent. If a corps or army comes to attack them, the Holy One, Blessed is He, protects them — and fights their battles, and °strikes them (the attackers) dead. Another interpretation of “behold, a people rises like a lion, etc.,” is as Targum [Onkelos] renders. "
Rashi on Numbers 23:24:3,"<b>And drinks the blood of its kill.</b> He prophesied that Moshe would not die °until he would strike the Midianite kings dead, and he (Bil’am) would be killed with them, as it is said, “and Bil’am the son of Beor, the sorcerer, the Bnei Yisroel killed by the sword, with the others whom they killed.” "
Rashi on Numbers 23:25:1,"<b>Also do not curse them.</b> °The first “also” is added to the second “also,” and the second “also” to the first “also.” Similarly, “also to me, also to you, let him not be.” Similarly, “also the youth, also the virgin.” 
"
Rashi on Numbers 23:27:1,"<b>And you will curse them for me.</b> °This is not a command, like “curse them,” but the future tense. “Perhaps it will be proper in His eyes, and you will curse them for me, from there.” “<i>Malduras lui</i>” (you will curse them), in Old French. "
Rashi on Numbers 23:28:1,"<b>To the peak of Pe’or.</b> Balak was a great sorcerer, and he saw that they were destined to be smitten through Pe’or, but he didn’t know in what way. He said, “Perhaps the curse will descend on them from there.” °It is similar with all the star gazers — they see, but do not know what they see. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 24:1:1,"<b>Bil’am saw that it was favorable, etc.</b> He said, “it is no longer necessary for me to test the Holy One, Blessed is He, for He will never want to curse them. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:1:2,"<b>He did not approach, as at each time.</b> As he had done twice. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:1:3,"<b>Towards sorcery.</b> To divine whether God would perhaps chance to appear to him as he wished. He said, “Whether or not He wants to curse them, °I will mention their sins, so that the curse will descend with the mention of their sins.” "
Rashi on Numbers 24:1:4,"<b>He set his face toward the wilderness.</b> °As Targum [Onkelos] renders. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 24:2:1,"<b>Bil’am raised his eyes.</b> He strove °to induce the evil eye in them. Here you have his three characteristics, the evil eye, false vanity, and greed, as stated above. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:2:2,"<b>Encamped according to its tribes.</b> He saw each tribe dwelling by itself, without mingling. He saw that their entrances did not face each other, so that one should not look into his neighbor’s tent. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:2:3,"<b>And the spirit of God rested upon him.</b> °It occurred to him not to curse them. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 24:3:1,"<b>The son of (lit. his son was) Be’or.</b> Like לְמַעְיְנוֹ מָיִם, “into a spring of water.” °According to Midrash Aggadah: Both were greater than their forefathers; “Balak, his son Tzipor” — his father was his son in royalty, and Bil’am was greater than his father in prophecy, °he was a coin, the son of half a coin. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:3:2,"<b>Of the open-socketed eye.</b> His eye had been put out and removed, and its socket appeared open. The word [שְׁתֻם] is in the Mishnah; °”enough for it to have been opened, sealed, and dried.” The Rabbis remark, because he said, “He counts the seed of Yisroel” — that the Holy One, Blessed is He, sits and counts the seed of the Israelites, awaiting the drop from which a saint will be born, he thought, “the One who is Holy, and whose ministering angels are holy, looks at these things”? For this, Bil’am’s eye was blinded. However, °some interpret שְׁתֻם הָעָיִן as “of the open eye,” as Targum [Onkelos] renders. And since he said “of the open eye,” °but did not say “of the open eyes,” we learn that he was blind in one of his eyes. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:4:1,"<b>Fallen, with opened eyes.</b> The plain interpretation is like Targum [Onkelos], that He (God) did not reveal Himself to him except at night, when he was lying down. °According to Midrash, when He revealed Himself to him, he did not have the strength to stand on his feet, but fell to his face, because he was uncircumcised, and it was disgusting to be revealed to him when he stood upright before Him. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:5:1,<b>How goodly are your tents.</b> Because he saw that their entrances were not facing each other.
Rashi on Numbers 24:5:2,"<b>Your dwelling places.</b> Your camps, as Targum [Onkelos] renders. Another interpretation of how goodly are your tents: How goodly is the tent of Shiloh and the Eternal Temple when they are inhabited, for sacrifices are offered in them to bring you forgiveness. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:5:3,"<b>Your dwelling places.</b> Even when they are desolate, since they are held as security for you, and their desolation brings atonement for your souls, as it is said, “Adonoy expended his fury” — and how did He expend it? “He ignited a fire in Tziyon.” "
Rashi on Numbers 24:6:1,"<b>They stretch forth like streams.</b> Which extend and flow, stretching across the distance. The Rabbis remark, ‘from that wicked one’s blessings, we learn how he intended to curse them, when he decided to set his face towards the wilderness. When the Omnipresent overturned [the words of] his mouth, his blessings corresponded with his intended curses, etc.,’ as stated in “Chelek.” "
Rashi on Numbers 24:6:2,"<b>Like the aloe trees.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] renders, meaning the same as “myrrh and aloes.” "
Rashi on Numbers 24:6:3,"<b>That Adonoy has planted.</b> In the garden of Eden. Another interpretation of כַּאֲהָלִים נָטַע ה', like the heavens stretched taut like a tent [as it is said, “He stretched them taut like a tent to be dwelt in”]. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:6:4,"<b>That Adonoy has planted,</b> The expression נְטִיעָה is found with relation to tents, as it is said, “he stretched taut his palatial tents.” 
"
Rashi on Numbers 24:7:1,<b>From his buckets.</b> From his wells. The explanation is as Targum [Onkelos] interprets.
Rashi on Numbers 24:7:2,"<b>And his seed will have an abundant flow.</b> This denotes success, like a seed planted near water. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:7:3,"<b>His king will be greater than Agag.</b> °Their first king shall conquer Agag, king of Amalek. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:7:4,"<b>And his monarchy shall be uplifted.</b> Yaakov’s [monarchy] more and more, as he (Shaul) shall be followed by Dovid and Shlomo. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:8:1,"<b>God Who has brought him out of Egypt.</b> Who gave them this eminence? God, who delivered them from Egypt °with his power and exaltedness, shall consume the nations who oppress him. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:8:2,<b>Their bones.</b> Of the oppressors.
Rashi on Numbers 24:8:3,"<b>He shall crush.</b> Menachem interprets this as denoting breaking. Similarly, “[wolves in the evening] who did not break any bones in the morning.” Similarly, “you shall crush its earthen vessels.” I say that the meaning is “bone.” He strips the surrounding flesh with his teeth, and the marrow from inside, °leaving the bone exposed. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:8:4,"<b>And dip His arrows [in their blood].</b> Onkelos interprets “the oppressors’ half,” their portion, °like בַּעֲלֵי חִצִּים, [translated as] מָרֵי פַלְגּוּתָא (meaning portion, or half), יִמְחָץ is similar, meaning the same as “she split [his skull], passing through his forehead” — they shall apportion their land. Also, this may be interpreted as actually denoting arrows. The arrows of the Holy One, Blessed is He, will יִמְחַץ in the blood of the oppressors, He shall dip and stain with their blood, as in, “that your foot may wade through blood” This is not a departure from the connotation of “wound,” as in “I have wounded,” since someone stained with blood appears to have been injured and wounded. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 24:9:1,"<b>He crouches and lies like a lion.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] renders, they will settle in their land with strength and power. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:10:1,<b>[He] clapped his hands.</b> He struck one against the other.
Rashi on Numbers 24:13:1,"<b>Transgress the word of Adonoy.</b> Here “<i>my</i>” God is not stated, as it was originally, for he knew that he was loathed by the Holy One, Blessed is He, and that he had been repudiated. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 24:14:1,"<b>Am returning to my people.</b> I am now like the rest of my people — the Holy One, Blessed is He, had forsaken him. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:14:2,"<b>Come, I will advise you.</b> Concerning the action you should take. What was the advice? The God of these people hates promiscuity, etc., as stated in “Chelek.” The proof that Bil’am instigated his advice so that they would be ensnared into immorality is from Scripture’s declaration, “they were involved with the Israelites through Bil’am’s advice.” "
Rashi on Numbers 24:14:3,"<b>What this people will do to your people.</b> This is a shortened passage; I will advise you about ensnaring them, and I will tell you how they are destined to destroy Moav at the end of days — “and smash the great men of Moav.” Targum [Onkelos] explains where the Hebrew falls short.

Rashi on Numbers 24:16:1,<b>And knows the thoughts of the Most Exalted.</b> To pinpoint the moment of His anger.
Rashi on Numbers 24:17:1,"<b>I see it.</b> I see the praise and greatness of Yaakov. Not, however, now, but at a later time. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:17:2,"<b>A star has gone forth.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] interprets. דָּרַךְ means the same as דָּרַךְ קַשְׁתּוֹ, “He hurled with His bow,” as a star travels like an arrow. In Old French, “<i>destente</i>” (“hurl”). As if to say, “a constellation shall rise.” "
Rashi on Numbers 24:17:3,<b>A staff has arisen.</b> A king who subdues and rules.
Rashi on Numbers 24:17:4,"<b>Smash the corners of Moav.</b> This refers to David, of whom it is said, “he laid them on the ground and measured two strings to kill, etc.” "
Rashi on Numbers 24:17:5,"<b>And impale.</b> The meaning is to penetrate, like, “I have excavated,” “the pit ax which quarried you” “let the ravens of the river gouge it.” “<i>Forjier</i>” (“pierce”), in Old French. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:17:6,"<b>All of the sons of Sheis.</b> All the nations, since they were all descended from Sheis, the son of Adam. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:18:1,"<b>Seir shall become the possession of his enemies.</b> °His enemies, the Bnei Yisroel. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:19:1,<b>A ruler shall come from Yaakov.</b> °Yet another ruler shall come from Yaakov.
Rashi on Numbers 24:19:2,"<b>Who will annihilate the survivors of the city.</b> Of the most prominent city of Edom, Rome. He said this concerning King Mashiach, of whom it is said, “he shall rule from sea to sea,” “there will be no survivors of the house of Eisav.” "
Rashi on Numbers 24:20:1,<b>[Bil’am] Saw Amalek.</b> °He gazed at Amalek’s punishment.
Rashi on Numbers 24:20:2,"<b>Amalek was the first among nations.</b> He preceded them all °in waging war against Israel. This, too, is Targum’s [Onkelos] interpretation. <b>And his end.</b> °Will be to perish by their hand, as it is said, “you shall obliterate the memory of Amalek.” "
Rashi on Numbers 24:20:3,
Rashi on Numbers 24:21:1,"<b>He saw the Keinite.</b> Because the Keinite was encamped near Amalek, as in the incident of which it is said, “Shaul said to the Keinite, etc.,” he mentioned him after Amalek. He gazed at the greatness of Yisro’s descendants, of whom it is said, °”Tirasites, Shimasites, Sochasites.” "
Rashi on Numbers 24:21:2,"<b>How powerful is your dwelling place.</b> °I wonder how you merited this. Were you not with me in counseling “come, let us deal shrewdly with them”? Yet now you have settled yourself in the power and strength of Israel. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:22:1,"<b>For, if Kayin is to be uprooted, etc.</b> How fortunate you are to be encamped in this stronghold, so that you will no longer be driven from the world.

Rashi on Numbers 24:22:2,"<b>Until where (lit. what) will Ashur take you captive.</b> Until where will he exile you? °Perhaps to Chalach and Chavor? This is not considered being driven from the world, but being shifted from place to place, and you shall return with the other exiles. "
Rashi on Numbers 24:23:1,"<b>He set forth his parable, etc.</b> Since he mentioned the captivity by Ashur, he said: Alas! who can survive from God’s devastation °Who is capable of self-survival against His putting these — so that He shall not put them [into effect] against him — He who decrees (God) — these?

Rashi on Numbers 25:4:4,"<b>Facing the sun.</b> °In full public view. Midrash Aggadah: The sun identifies the sinners. °The cloud rolls back from the area above him, °and the sun shines on him. "

Rashi on Numbers 26:11:1,"<b>But the sons of Korach did not die.</b> They were involved in the conspiracy at first, but during the dispute, °they repented in their hearts. Therefore, °an elevated area was secured for them in <i>gehinom,</i> where they remained. "
Rashi on Numbers 26:13:1,"<b>From Zerach.</b> This was Tzochar, meaning the same as “Tzohar,” illumination. °However, the family of Ohad became extinct. Also, five [families] of the tribe of Binyamin, as he had descended to Egypt with ten sons, yet here only five are counted. °Also, Etzbon, of Gad — so there are seven families. I found, in the Talmud Yerushalmi, that when Aharon died the clouds of glory departed, and the Canaanites came to wage war against Israel. They (Bnei Yisroel) resolved to return to Egypt, and went back eight journeys, from Mount Hor to Moserah, as it is said, “Bnei Yisroel journeyed from Be’eros Bnei Yaakon to Moserah, where Aharon died.” Now did he not die at Mount Hor? °And from Moserah to Mount Hor there are eight journeys going back. But, they returned, and the Levites pursued them to bring them back, killing seven of their families. And four Levite families fell; The families of Shim’i and Uzieli. °Of the sons of Yitzhar, none are counted here, except for the Korachite family. °I do not know the identity of the fourth. R’ Tanchuma expounded, °that they died in the plague at the affair of Bil’am — however, according to the loss suffered by the tribe of Shimon in this counting, °as compared with the first counting at the Sinai desert, it appears that all twenty four thousand °fell from the tribe of Shimon. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 26:16:1,"<b>From Ozni.</b> °I say that this was the family of Etzbon, but I do not know why his family was not called by his name. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 26:24:1,"<b>From Yashuv.</b> °This is Yov, mentioned among those who went down to Egypt, as all of the families were called by the names of those who went down to Egypt. As for those who were born afterward, none of the families were called by their names, except for the families of Efrayim and Menashe, all of whom were born in Egypt, °and Ard and Na’aman, the sons of Bela, the son of Binyamin. I found, in the commentary of R’ Moshe Hadarshan, °that their mother went down to Egypt when she was pregnant with them, and °they were, therefore, divided into separate families, like Chetzron and Chamul, who were Yehudah’s grandsons, and Chever and Malkiel, who were Asher’s grandsons. °If this is from the Aggadah, fine, but if not, then I say that Bela had a great many grandchildren, and from those two, Ard and Na’aman, °respectively, large families emanated. The descendants of the other children were called by Bela’s name, while the descendants of those two were called by their names. I say the same about the sons of Machir, who were divided into two families, one called by his name, and one called by the name of his son, Gil’ad. °Five families are missing from the sons of Binyamin. Here, his mother’s prophecy was partially fulfilled — she called him בֶּן אוֹנִי, “son of my sorrow.” With the concubine of Givah, it was completely fulfilled. I found this in the commentary of R’ Moshe Hadarshan. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 26:36:1,"<b>These are the sons of Shuselach, etc.</b> The descendants of °the other sons of Shuselach were called by the name Shuselach, but from Eiran a large family emanated, so it was called by his name. Thus, the sons of Shuselach were considered two families. Go and calculate, and you will discover, in this chapter, fifty seven families, and eight from the sons of Levi — hence, sixty five. This is [the meaning of] what is said, כִּי אַתֶּם ""הַמְעַט"" וְגוֹ', “for you are the least, etc. “ הֵ""א מְעַט, “five less.” You are five less than all the gentile families, as they are seventy. This, too, I understood from the commentary of R’ Moshe Hadarshan, but I had to subtract and add to his words.

Rashi on Numbers 26:38:1,"<b>From Achiram.</b> This is Eichi, who went down to Egypt. Because he was named to commemorate Yoseif, who was his brother and was exalted over him, he was called Achiram. "

"
Rashi on Numbers 26:53:1,"<b>The land shall be apportioned among these.</b> But not among those below the age of twenty, °even if they reach twenty before the apportioning of the land. Indeed, the conquest lasted seven years, and the apportioning seven, yet no one received a portion in the land except for these six hundred and one thousand. If one of them had six sons, they received nothing but their father’s portion. "
Rashi on Numbers 26:54:1,"<b>To the large [tribe], increase their inheritance.</b> To the tribe with the greater populace, °they gave a larger portion. Although the portions were unequal, as everything was assigned according to the size of the tribe, they implemented the apportioning solely by lots, and the lottery was inspired by the Sacred Spirit, as stated explicitly in Bava Basra. Elozor the <i>kohein</i> was clothed in the <i>Urim veTumim,</i> and said, with the Sacred Spirit, “If tribe so-and-so is drawn, then border so-and-so will be drawn with it.” The [names of the] tribes were written on twelve notes, and the twelve boundaries on twelve notes. They were mixed into a container, and the leader placed his hand into it and removed two notes. There appeared, in his hand, the note with the name of his tribe, and the note with the boundary specified for it. The lot itself would cry out, exclaiming, “I am the lot drawn for the so-and-so boundary, belonging to tribe so-and-so,” as it is said, “by word of the lottery.” The land was not apportioned dimensionally, since some boundaries were superior to others, but by assessed value. A poor <i>Kor</i> area was equivalent to a superior <i>Seah</i> area, all according to the value [of the soil.] 
"
Rashi on Numbers 26:55:1,"<b>According to the names of their fathers’ tribes.</b> This refers to those who left Egypt. °Scripture deviates, with this inheritance, from all the others in the Torah. With every inheritance, the living inherit the dead, °but here, the dead inherit the living. How is this? Two brothers among those who left Egypt °had sons who entered the land, one had one son, the other, three. The single son received one portion, the three, three portions, as it is said, “the land shall be apportioned to these.” Their inheritance reverted °to their grandfather, and they then shared everything equally. This is [the meaning of] what is said, “according to the names of their fathers’ tribes, they shall inherit” — after the sons received it, they reapportioned it according to the fathers who left Egypt. But if they had apportioned it originally among those numbered in the exodus from Egypt, the four would have received only two portions, whereas they now received four portions. "
Rashi on Numbers 26:55:2,"<b>Only by lot.</b> °This excludes Yehoshua and Kalev. And similarly it says, “they presented Kalev with Chevron, as Moshe had said.” And it says, “by the word of God they gave him the city which he requested.” "
Rashi on Numbers 26:55:3,<b>Of their fathers’ tribes.</b> This excludes proselytes and [gentile] slaves.
Rashi on Numbers 26:56:1,"<b>By word of the lottery.</b> °The lots spoke, as I explained above. This informs us that it was apportioned by the inspiration of the Sacred Spirit. This is why it is said, “By the word of God.” "
Rashi on Numbers 26:58:1,"<b>These are the families of Levi.</b> There are missing, here, the families of Shim’i and Ozieili, and part of Yitzhari.

Rashi on Numbers 26:59:1,"<b>Whom [her mother] bore to Levi in Egypt.</b> °Her birth was in Egypt, but she was not conceived in Egypt. As they were entering the wall, she bore her, and she completed the total of seventy. For, in enumeration, you will only find sixty-nine. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 26:62:1,"<b>They were not counted among Bnei Yisroel.</b> °To have been counted from the age of twenty. What’s the reason? °Since no inheritance was given to them. Whereas those who were counted from the age of twenty were qualified to receive the inheritance, as it is said, “each person, according to his number, shall be given his inheritance.” 
"
Rashi on Numbers 26:64:1,"<b>Among this [census] there was no man, etc.</b> °However, against the women, the decree of the spies was not issued, since they cherished the land. The men said, “let us appoint a leader and we will return to Egypt”! °while the women said, “give us possession”! This is why the chapter of the daughters of Tzelofchad is adjacent here. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 27:1:1,"<b>Of the families of Menashe the son of Yoseif.</b> Why is this said? Has it not already said “the son of Menashe”? But it teaches you: Yoseif cherished the land, as it is said: “You must carry up my bones up, etc.,” and his daughters cherished the land, as it is said: “Give us possession,”! And °to teach you, that they were all righteous. For where someone’s deeds, and the deeds of his forefathers, are not defined, and Scripture specifically relates one of them to a virtuous ancestor, then this is a righteous person, the son of a righteous person. If he is related disparagingly, as, for example, “Yishmael, the son of Nesanyah, the son of Elishama,” then it is known that everyone mentioned with him was villainous. "
Rashi on Numbers 27:1:2,"<b>Machlah, No’ah, etc.</b> Below it says, “Machlah and Sirtzah were. . .” This teaches that they were all equal — the order was, therefore, changed. "
Rashi on Numbers 27:2:1,"<b>Before Moshe and before Elozor.</b> This teaches that they only stood before them in the fortieth year, after Aharon had died. "
Rashi on Numbers 27:2:2,"<b>Before Moshe.</b> And afterward before Elozor? Is it possible that Moshe did not know and that Elozor did know? °But, rearrange the passage and expound upon it. This is R’ Yoshiyah’s interpretation. Aba Chanan said in the name of R’ Elozor: “They were seated in the study hall, and they stood before all of them.” "
Rashi on Numbers 27:3:1,"<b>But he was not, etc.</b> Since they were going to say that he died because of his sin, they needed to say, ‘not the sin of the complainers, nor with Korach's assembly, who incited [the people] against the Holy One, Blessed is He — was he. Rather, °he died by his sin alone, without provoking others to sin with him.’ R’ Akiva said, °”He was the wood gatherer,” R’ Shimon said, “He was °among those who ascended defiantly.” "
Rashi on Numbers 27:4:1,"<b>Why should the name of our father be omitted.</b> We are substitutes for a son. And if females are not considered issue, then let our mother perform levirate marriage with her brother-in-law. "
Rashi on Numbers 27:4:2,"<b>Because he did not have a son.</b> °But if he had a son, they would not have entered a claim. This teaches °that they were learned. "
Rashi on Numbers 27:5:1,"<b>Moshe brought their case.</b> °The halachah was concealed from him. Here he was punished for assuming the crown by saying, “Matters too difficult for you, you may bring before me.” °Another interpretation: It was fitting that this chapter be written through Moshe, but the daughters of Tzelofchad were meritorious, and it was written through them. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 27:7:1,"<b>Tzelofchad’s daughters speak justly.</b> °As Targum renders, יָאוּת, “correctly.” This chapter is just so inscribed before Me on high. This teaches that their eye discerned what Moshe’s did not. "

Rashi on Numbers 27:7:3,"<b>Give [lit. Give, you shall give].</b> °Two portions. The portion of their father, who was among those who left Egypt, and his portion with his brothers, in the property of Cheifer. "
Rashi on Numbers 27:7:4,"<b>Transfer.</b> The word הַעֲבַרְתָּ °denotes transference (anger), when someone does not leave a son to inherit him. Another interpretation: Because a daughter transfers the inheritance from tribe to tribe, as her son or husband inherit her. The prohibition against transferring an inheritance was placed °only on that generation. Similarly, “his hereditary property shall be transferred to his daughter.” With all of them, it says “give,” but with the daughter, it says “transfer.” "
Rashi on Numbers 27:11:1,"<b>The the relative closest to him in his family.</b> °Nothing constitutes family except from the father’s side. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 27:12:1,"<b>Go up this Avarim Mountain.</b> °Why is this placed here? When the Holy One, Blessed is He, said [to Moshe], “give them. . .,” he said, ‘God commanded me to give them the hereditary property. Perhaps the decree was abrogated, and I may enter the land.’ The Holy One, Blessed is He, said to him, “My decree remains in place.” °Another interpretation: When Moshe entered the inheritance given to the sons of Gad and Reuven, he rejoiced, and said, ‘It seems that the vow regarding me was abrogated.’ This is comparable to a king who decreed that his son could not enter the doorway to his palace. He [the King] entered the gateway, and he [the son] followed, [he entered] the courtyard, and he followed, [he entered] the anteroom, and he followed. When he was about to enter °the chamber, he [the king] said to him, ‘My son, from here and onward, you are forbidden to enter.’ 
"
Rashi on Numbers 27:13:1,"<b>As your brother Aharon was gathered.</b> °From here we derive that Moshe yearned for a death such as Aharon’s. °Another interpretation: You are no better than he. “Because you did not sanctify. . .” But if you had sanctified Me, °your time would not yet have arrived, for passing from the world. Wherever their death is mentioned, their iniquity is mentioned, because it was decreed that the generation of the wilderness would die in the wilderness, for their sin of not having faith. Moshe, therefore, requested that his iniquity be mentioned, so that it would not be said that he, too, was among those who rebelled. This is comparable to two women who were punished by the court, °one for degenerate behavior, °the other for eating unripened Shmittah produce, etc. Here, too, wherever their death is mentioned, their iniquity is mentioned, to make it known that there was nothing [sinful] about them but this. "
Rashi on Numbers 27:14:1,"<b>Those were the waters of dispute at Kadeish.</b> Those alone — °they had no other sins. Another interpretation: Those of °the rebellion at Marah were the same as those of the rebellion at the Reed Sea, and the very same as those of the rebellion at the desert of Tzin. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 27:15:1,"<b>Moshe spoke to Adonoy, etc.</b> °To make the virtue of the righteous known — when they pass from the world, they ignore their own needs, and concern themselves with the needs of the community. "

Rashi on Numbers 27:16:1,"<b>Let Adonoy . . . appoint.</b> When Moshe heard the Omnipresent say to him, ‘give Tzelofchad’s inheritance to his daughters,’ °he said, ‘The time has come for me to ask for a personal request — that my sons may inherit my position of leadership.’ The Holy One, Blessed is He said to him, ‘That is not My intention. Yehoshua is worthy of being rewarded for his service, °as he never moved from the tent. This is [the meaning of] Shlomo’s statement, “he who keeps watch over the fig tree shall eat its fruit.” "
Rashi on Numbers 27:16:2,"<b>God of the spirits.</b> °Why was this said? He said before Him: “Master of the universe, the thought of every individual is known before you, each dissimilar to the other’s. Appoint a leader over them who will exercise forbearance with each of them according to his intellect.” "
Rashi on Numbers 27:17:1,"<b>Who will go forth before them.</b> Unlike the approach of the gentile kings, who stay at home and dispatch their armies to war. Rather, as I did, when I battled Sichon and Og, as it is said, “do not fear him,” and the way Yehoshua acted, as it is said, “Yehoshua went to him and said to him, ‘are you ours, etc.”’ Similarly, with David, it says, “for he goes forth and comes before them.” He goes forth at their head, and enters at their head. "
Rashi on Numbers 27:17:2,<b>Who will lead them out.</b> With his merit.
Rashi on Numbers 27:17:3,<b>And bring them in.</b> With his merit. °Another interpretation of “and bring them in”: That You will not treat him the way You treat me — for I will not bring them into the land.
Rashi on Numbers 27:18:1,<b>Take to yourself.</b> °Take him with words of persuasion — you are fortunate to merit leading the children of the Omnipresent.

Rashi on Numbers 27:18:4,"<b>And lay your hand on him.</b> °Provide a public announcer for him in order °that he might preach during your lifetime, so that it should not be said of him that he was unable to lift his head in Moshe’s day.

Rashi on Numbers 27:20:1,<b>Bestow some of your radiance on him.</b> This refers to radiance of the facial skin.
Rashi on Numbers 27:20:2,"<b>Some of your radiance.</b> But not all your radiance. Hence we learn that °the face of Moshe was like the sun, the face of Yehoshua like the moon. "
Rashi on Numbers 27:20:3,"<b>So that the entire community of Bnei Yisroel will hear.</b> °They will treat him with reverence and awe, the way they treat you.

Rashi on Numbers 27:23:2,<b>As Adonoy had commanded.</b> also regarding the radiance — He bestowed some of his radiance on him.
Rashi on Numbers 28:2:1,"<b>Command Bnei Yisroel.</b> What is stated above? °”May God command. . .” The Holy One, Blessed is He, said to him, °‘Before you command Me concerning My children, command My children concerning Me.’ This is comparable to a princess who was passing from the world. She instructed her husband concerning her children, etc., as is stated in Sifri. "
Rashi on Numbers 28:2:2,<b>My offering.</b> °This refers to the blood.

Rashi on Numbers 28:4:1,"<b>One lamb.</b> Although it is already stated in the <i>parasha</i> of “You shall command” — “this is what you shall offer,” — those instructions were for the days of inauguration, whereas °here, the commandment is for all the generations. "

Rashi on Numbers 28:6:1,<b>As offered on Mount Sinai.</b> °Like those which were done during the days of inauguration. Another interpretation [of] which was done at Mount Sinai: The constant burnt-offering is compared to the burnt-offering at Mount Sinai — the one brought before the giving of the Torah — of which Scripture states “. . .and [he] placed it in the basins.” This teaches that it (the constant-offering) requires a vessel.
Rashi on Numbers 28:7:1,<b>Its libation.</b> °Wine.
Rashi on Numbers 28:7:2,"<b>In the Holy [Sanctuary], you shall pour.</b> °They shall be poured on the altar. "
Rashi on Numbers 28:7:3,"<b>An intoxicating libation.</b> Intoxicating wine. This excludes wine, fresh from the wine press. "

Rashi on Numbers 28:10:2,"<b>In addition to the constant (daily) burnt-offering.</b> This refers to the <i>musaf</i> sacrifices, aside from the two constant burnt-offering lambs. This teaches that they (the <i>musaf</i> sacrifices) may be brought only °between the two constant-offerings. Similarly, concerning all the <i>musaf</i> sacrifices it is said, “in addition to the constant burnt-offering,” for this teaching. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 28:12:1,"<b>Three tenths [of an <i>eiphah</i>].</b> As specified for the libations of a bull, °designated as such in the chapter of the libations. "

Rashi on Numbers 28:15:1,"<b>And one he-goat, etc.</b> °All the <i>musaf</i> goats came in atonement for °the ritual defilement of the Sanctuary and its sacred objects, everything as explained in Tractate Shevuos. There is a distinction with the New Moon goat, for it is said, concerning it, “. . .to God.” This teaches you that it atones for someone °who was not cognizant either at the beginning or the end, as no one recognizes the transgression save for the Holy One, Blessed is He, alone. °The other goats are derived from this one. °This is also expounded <i>aggadically</i> [as follows]: The Holy One, Blessed is He, said: ‘Bring atonement for Me, because I diminished the moon.’ "

Rashi on Numbers 28:24:1,"<b>Like these, yoshall make daily.</b> They should not be progressively decreasing like the oxen of the [<i>Succos</i>] festival. "
Rashi on Numbers 28:26:1,"<b>On the day of the first fruits.</b> The Shavuos festival is called “[The festival of] the first fruits of the wheat harvest,” because of the offering of the two loaves, °which are the first of the wheat <i>minchah</i>-offerings to come from the new crop.

Rashi on Numbers 28:31:1,"<b>[The sacrifices] shall be without blemish — and their libations.</b> The libations must also be unblemished. °The Rabbis derive from this that wine in which floury decay globules have surfaced is disqualified for libations.

Rashi on Numbers 29:11:1,"<b>Aside from the atonement sin-offering.</b> The goat offered in the inner chamber, mentioned in “Acharei Mos.” It, too, was a sin- offering. "
Rashi on Numbers 29:11:2,"<b>And the constant (daily) burnt- offering</b> And °aside from the constant burnt- offering, you shall offer these burnt-offerings. "
Rashi on Numbers 29:11:3,"<b>And their libations.</b> °This relates to the <i>musaf</i>-offerings stated above, and to “you shall offer.” °It denotes a command: ‘Aside from the constant burnt-offering and its <i>minchah,</i> you shall offer these and their libations.’ It is the same with every “their libations” said at all the festivals, except those concerning the [<i>Succos</i>] holiday sacrifices. Every “and its libation,” “and their libations,” “and its libations” among them refer to the constant sacrifice, and are not commands, since the <i>musaf</i> libations are written separately for each day. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 29:18:1,"<b>Their meal-offerings and their libations for the bulls.</b> There were seventy festival bulls, representing the seventy nations, which were progressively diminishing, symbolizing their destruction. During the time of the Sanctuary, [however,] These sacrifices shielded them from suffering. "
Rashi on Numbers 29:18:2,"<b>And the lambs.</b> Representing Israel, which is called “the dispersed lamb.” Their numbers are constant, and they total ninety eight, to nullify the ninety eight curses in Mishneh Torah. On the second day, וְנִסְכֵּיהֶם, “and their libations,” is said, in relation to the day’s two constant-offerings. The change in language was intended for exposition, as the Rabbis, of blessed memory, remarked: On the second day, וְנִסְכֵּיהֶם, “and their libations,” is said, on the sixth, וּנְסָכֶיהָ, “and her libations,” on the seventh, כְּמִשְׁפָּטָם, “according to ‘their’ requirement.” מ""ם, יו""ד, מ""ם . which spells מַּיִם, “water,” and is an allusion that the water libation, during the Festival is Scriptural.

Rashi on Numbers 29:35:1,"<b>Shall be a [day of] restraint for you.</b> °Restraint from doing work. °Another interpetation [of] restraint, restrain yourselves from leaving. This teaches that they were required to remain overnight. °According to the Aggadic Midrash, because, throughout the entire holiday, they brought offerings which represented the seventy nations.

Rashi on Numbers 29:36:1,"<b>One young bull, one ram.</b> These °represent Yisroel [which is singular to the Holy One, Blessed is He] — ‘Remain with Me a little longer’. This denotes affection, as when children take leave of their father, and he says to them, ‘Your departure distresses me, remain yet another day’. This is compared to a king who made a repast, etc., as stated in tractate Succah. Midrash R’ Tanchumah interprets: The Torah teaches °proper conduct. Someone who entertains a guest should, on the first day, feed him fattened fowl, the next day fish, the next beef, the next day he should feed him grains, and the next, vegetables. Progressive diminishment, like the festival bulls. "

Rashi on Numbers 29:39:2,"<b>Aside from your vows.</b> If you should decide to vow offerings during the holiday, this will be credited to you as a commendable act.

Rashi on Numbers 30:1:1,"<b>Moshe spoke to Bnei Yisroel.</b> This concludes the subject, comments R’ Yishmael. °Because, up until this point, we have the words of the Omnipresent, and the chapter of vows begins with the words of Moshe, it is necessary to conclude the subject by saying that Moshe reviewed this <i>parshah</i> with the Israelites. Otherwise, the implication would be that he (Moshe) did not tell them this, but began his discourse with the chapter of vows.

Rashi on Numbers 30:1:2,
Rashi on Numbers 30:2:1,"<b>The tribal leaders.</b> He bestowed honor on the leaders °by teaching them first, and afterward, all of Bnei Yisroel. How do we know that the other discourses were so? The Torah therefore teaches, “. . . they returned to him— Aharon and all the leaders of the congregation— and Moshe spoke to them. Afterward, all of Bnei Yisroel approached.” °Why, then, did he see fit to say this here? He taught that °vows may be nullified by a single expert. When there is no single expert, nullification is °by three laymen. But perhaps Moshe recited this chapter °only to the leaders? “This is the word” is said here, and it is said concerning slaughtering outside [the Temple], “this is the word.” Just as that was said to Aharon and his sons, and all of Bnei Yisroel, as it is said, “speak to Aharon, etc.,” so was this, said to all of them. "
Rashi on Numbers 30:2:2,"<b>This is the word.</b> °Moshe prophesied with “this is what Adonoy has said, about the time of midnight. . .,” and the [other] prophets prophesied with “this is what Adonoy has said:” Moshe surpassed them, as he prophesied °with the phrase “this is the word.” °Another interpretation: “This is the word” is exclusionary, teaching that °the Sage [annuls] with the term “release,” and the husband with the term “nullification,” °following the Scriptural language here. If they reverse the terminology, there is neither release nor nullification. "
Rashi on Numbers 30:3:1,"<b>A vow.</b> By saying, ‘Let it be as °a <i>konam</i> to me, that I will not eat, or I may not do a certain thing.’ But perhaps, even if he swears to eat the meat of an animal that was not ritually slaughtered, I read, concerning him, “all that he has verbalized, he must fulfill”? The Torah, therefore, teaches, “. . .to initiate a prohibition”— to prohibit what is permitted, but not to permit what is prohibited. "

When is she considered a minor? Our Rabbis say, at the age of eleven and a day, her vows should be examined. If she recognizes in Who’s Name she took the vow, or in Who’s Name she made the sanctification, then her vow is valid. At the age of twelve and a day, examination is no longer required. "
Rashi on Numbers 30:6:1,"<b>But if her father restrained her.</b> He restrained her from the vow, in other words, he nullified it. °I would not know what this הֲנָאָה means, but when it says, “but if, on the day her husband hears about it, יָנִיא אוֹתָהּ וְהֵפֵר, he restrains her and nullifies,” you may conclude that הֲנָאָה means nullification. Its plain meaning is to restrain and turn aside. Similarly, “why do you turn [the people’s hearts] away,” and “let the oil on my head not turn my head,” and “you will know My turning aside” [i.e. the punishment] for turning away from Me.” 
"
Rashi on Numbers 30:6:2,"<b>Adonoy will forgive her.</b> To whom does Scripture refer? To a woman who took the Nazirite vow. Her husband heard and nullified it, but she was not aware. She then violated her vow by drinking wine and defiling herself by contact with a corpse. She is in need of forgiveness, although it was nullified. Now, if those who[se vows] have been nullified require forgiveness, certainly those who[se vows] have not been nullified. 
"
Rashi on Numbers 30:7:1,"<b>If she is [married] to a man.</b> This refers to an “<i>arusah.</i>” °But perhaps to a “<i>nesuah?</i>” When it says, “and if she took the vow in her husband’s home,” a “<i>nesuah</i>” is mentioned, °so this must mean an “<i>arusah.</i>” It is intended to distinguish her, in °that her father and her husband annul her vow. If the father annulled, but not the husband, or the husband, but not the father, there is no annulment, and it goes without saying, °if one of them endorsed it. "
Rashi on Numbers 30:7:2,"<b>And her vows were upon herself.</b> She took the vows in her father’s home, °but her father did not hear them — they were neither annulled °nor endorsed. "

Rashi on Numbers 30:9:1,"<b>He then annuls her vow which was upon her.</b> °Perhaps even if the father did not annul? The Torah therefore teaches, “in her youth, while in her father’s house” — °all through her youth, she is under her father’s jurisdiction. "
Rashi on Numbers 30:10:1,"<b>Everything she prohibited for herself shall remain incumbent upon her.</b> Since she is neither under the jurisdiction of the father, nor the jurisdiction of the husband. Scripture refers here to °a widow after “<i>nisuin,</i>” but a widow after “<i>erusin,</i>” when the husband dies, his jurisdiction transfers to the father. "

Rashi on Numbers 31:2:1,"<b>Against the Midianites.</b> °But not against the Moavites, for the Moavites entered the matter out of fear. They were afraid of them, [fearing] that they would plunder them, as it only says, “do not provoke them with warfare.” The Midianites, however, were °enraged over a dispute which was not theirs.

Before they heard about his death, what did he say? “a while more and they will stone me”! Yet, when they heard that the death of Moshe depended on the vengeance against Midian, °they refused to go until they were handed over, against their wishes. "
Rashi on Numbers 31:6:1,"<b>Them, and Pinchas.</b> °This teaches that Pinchas was equivalent to all of them. But °why did Pinchas go, while Elozor did not? The Holy One, Blessed is He, said, “The one who began the <i>mitzvah</i> °by executing Kozbi, the daughter of Tzur, should complete it.” Another interpretation: He sought to avenge Yoseif, his maternal forefather, as it is said, “the Midianites sold him. . .” How is it derived that the mother of Pinchas was [descended] from Yoseif? Since it is said, “of the daughters of Putiel (פּוּטִיאֵל).” Of the children of Yisro, who fattened (פִּיטֵם) calves for idol worship, and of the children of Yoseif, who scorned (פִּטְפֵּט) his evil inclination. Another interpretation: He was annointed for warfare. "
Rashi on Numbers 31:6:2,"<b>With the sacred vessels.</b> °This refers to the Ark and the Golden Headplate. Because Bil’am accompanied them, and caused the Midianite kings to fly through sorcery, he himself flying with them, he [Pinchas] displayed the Golden Headplate to them, in which the Divine Name was engraved, and they fell. This is why it is said, “. . .on those they had slain,” concerning the Midianite kings — they fell from the air on the slain ones.

Rashi on Numbers 31:8:1,"<b>[The] five kings of Midian.</b> Can I not see that Scripture enumerates five? Why, then, is it necessary to say “five”?

He went from Midian to the Bnei Yisroel, °and offered them evil advice. he said to them, “If when you were six hundred thousand you could not overcome them, and now you intend to fight them with twelve thousand?’ They gave him °his reward, in full without stinting.

Rashi on Numbers 31:17:2,"<b>You shall execute.</b> Why is this repeated? To separate the matter— these are R’ Yishmael’s remarks. °For, when I read, “execute every male among the children, and every woman with intimate knowledge of a man, and all the children among the females, etc.,” I do not know [concerning every woman with intimate knowledge of a man] whether to execute [them] with the males, or allow them to live with the children. °This is why “[you must] execute” is said.

Rashi on Numbers 31:19:2,"<b>Whoever has killed a person.</b> R’ Meir said, “Scripture refers to a person who kills with an object capable of receiving contamination, and Scripture teaches °that a utensil defiles a person when it is in contact with a corpse as if he had touched the corpse itself. Or, perhaps even if he shot an arrow at him and killed him? The Torah, therefore, teaches, “and whoever touched a corpse.” It compares one who kills with one who touches. Just as the one who touches (receives contamination) through contact, so does the one who kills (receives contamination) through contact.” "
Rashi on Numbers 31:19:3,"<b>Purify yourselves.</b> With sprinkling water, as prescribed for others who were defiled by contact with the dead. For, even those who rule that Gentile graves do not convey contamination in a tent, — as it is said, “you, my sheep, my pastoral sheep, you are man”; you are entitled “man,” he admits that gentiles convey contamination through touching and carrying. °Since “man” was only said in the context of tent contamination, as it is said, “a person who dies in a tent.” "
Rashi on Numbers 31:19:4,"<b>You and your captives.</b> Not that the gentiles receive contamination and require sprinkling. Rather, just as you are members of the convenant, so with your captives, when they enter the covenant — should they become contaminated, °they will require sprinkling. "

Rashi on Numbers 31:21:1,"<b>Elozor the <i>kohein</i> said, etc.</b> Because Moshe fell into a state of anger, he fell into a state of error, so concealed from him, were the laws concerning purging the utensils of gentiles. You find a similarity on the eighth day of inauguration, as it is said, “he was angry with Elozor and with Isamar”— he fell into a state of anger, [and] he fell into a state or error. Similarly with “listen, now, rebels”! “he struck the rock.” Because of anger, he erred.

Rashi on Numbers 31:22:1,"<b>Only the gold, etc.</b> Although Moshe did not warn you except for the laws of ritual uncleanliness, you must be warned further, concerning the laws of purging. “Only” denotes exclusion, as if to say, ‘you are excluded from using the utensils, even after their purification from contamination by the dead, until they are purified from the absorption of forbidden “<i>neveilah</i>” meat.’ Our Rabbis remark that “only the gold, etc.” teaches that one must remove its rust before purging it.

Rashi on Numbers 31:23:3,"<b>However, it must be purified with sprinkling water.</b> According to the plain interpretation, this purification is °to cleanse it from the contamination of the dead.

Rashi on Numbers 34:2:2,"<b>Will fall to you.</b> Because it was apportioned by lot, the apportionment is described °in terms of falling.

Rashi on Numbers 34:3:2,"<b>From the Tzin wilderness.</b> Which adjoining Edom, begins the °southeastern corner of the land of the nine tribes. How is this? °Three countries lie south of Eretz Yisroel, each adjoining the next; part of the land of Egypt, all of the land of Edom, and all of the land of Moav. The land of Egypt is at the southwestern corner, as it is said in this <i>Parshah,</i> “[the border turns] from Atzmon to the Egyptian Estuary and its outskirts shall reach the sea.” The Egyptian Estuary’s path faced the entire land of Egypt, as it is said, °”from the [river] Shichor, facing Egypt,” and separates the land of Egypt from Eretz Yisroel. The land of Edom adjoined it eastward, °with the land of Moav °adjoining the land of Edom at the eastern end of the southern border. When the Bnei Yisroel left Egypt, had the Omnipresent desired to hasten their entry into the land, He would have brought them northward across the Nile, and they would have entered Eretz Yisroel — but He did not do so. This is the meaning of what is said, “God did not lead them along the route of the land of the P’lishtim,” who dwelt by the sea, on the western border of the land of Canaan, as is said concerning the P’lishtim, “those who dwell on the territory by the sea, the Kereisite nation.” He did not lead them along that route, but diverted them, bringing them out by the southern route, into the wilderness — the Yechezkel called “the wilderness of nations,” because several nations dwelt alongside it. He then led them in the south from west to east, continuously, until they reached south of the land of Edom. They requested that the king of Edom permit them to enter his land, traverse its width, and enter the land, but he refused, so they had to travel around the entire southern side of Edom, until they reached south of the land of Moav, as it is said, “he also sent emissaries to the king of Moav, but he refused.” They traveled along the entire southern side of Moav, to the end. From there they turned their faces to the north, until they traveled around its entire eastern border along its width. When they completed its eastern side, they came upon the territory of Sichon and Og, who dwelt east of the land of Canaan, with the Yardein interposing between them. This is the meaning of what was said by Yiftach, “they traveled in the wilderness, proceeded around the land of Edom and the land of Moav, and came to [the end of] the eastern border of the land of Moav.” They conquered the territory of Sichon and Og, which was north of the land of Moav, and came abreast of the Yardein, opposite the northwest corner of the land of Moav. Thus, the land of Canaan across the Yardein to the west had its sourtheastern corner adjacent to Moav.

Rashi on Numbers 34:4:1,"<b>The border then turns south of Maaleh Akrabim.</b> Wherever it says “turns” or “extends,” it teaches that the border was not even, but swerved away.

The Yardein flows diagonally, from north to south, angling towards the east, moves towards the land of Canaan at Lake Kineres and continues along the eastern side of Eretz Yisroel opposite Lake Kineres, until emptying into the Dead Sea. From there, the border closes with its extremity reaching the Dead Sea, from which the southeastern corner of the border began, thus surrounding it on all four sides.

For it is clearly evident to The Holy One, Blessed is He, that iron of any size can kill, even a needle. The Torah, therefore, did not specify a size by saying “which can kill.” Still, you may ask, “perhaps our passage refers to one who killed inadvertently?” °But it states, below, “or, °with a stone which can kill, without seeing, etc.” This teaches that, in its statements above, Scripture refers to premeditated murder.
