"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.1.1","1. In the days of Enosh, the people fell into gross error, and the counsel of the wise men of the generation became foolish. Enosh himself was among those who erred. Their error was as follows: ""Since God"", they said, ""created these stars and spheres to guide the world, set them on high and allotted unto them honour, and since they are ministers who minister before Him, they deserve to be praised and glorified, and honour should be rendered them; and it is the will of God, blessed be He, that men should aggrandise and honour those whom He aggrandised and honoured—just as a king desires that respect should be shown to the officers who stand before Him, and thus honour is shown to the king."" When this idea arose in their minds, they began to erect temples to the stars, offered up sacrifices to them, praised and glorified them in speech, and prostrated themselves before them—their purpose, according to their perverse notions, being to obtain the Creator's favour. This was the root of idolatry, and this was what the idolaters, who knew its fundamentals, said. They did not however maintain that there was no God except the particular star (which was the object of their worship). Thus Jeremiah said ""Who would not fear thee, O king of nations ? For it befitteth Thee; for as much as among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdom, there is none like unto Thee. But in one thing they are brutish and foolish. The vanities by which they are instructed are but a stock"" (Jerem. 10:7-8). This means that all know that Thou alone art God; their error and folly consists in imagining that this vain worship is Thy desire."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.1.2","2. In course of time, there arose among men false prophets who asserted that God had commanded and expressly told them, ""Worship that particular star, or worship all the stars. Offer up to it such and such sacrifices. Pour out to it such and such libations. Erect a temple to it. Make a figure of it, to which all the people—the women, children, and the rest of the folk—shall bow down"". The false prophet pointed out to them the figure which he had invented out of his own mind, and asserted that it is the figure of that particular star, which had been shown him in his prophetic vision. And then, they began to make figures in temples, under the trees, on the mountain-tops and the hills. There they would assemble, bow down to the figures, and tell all the people that this particular figure conferred benefits and inflicted injuries, and that it was proper to worship and fear it. Their priests would say to them, ""Through this worship, shall ye increase and prosper. Do this, and do not do that"". Other imposters then sprang up, who declared that the star, celestial sphere or angel, had communed with them, and said to them ""Worship me in such and such fashion"", had taught them a definite ritual and said to them ""Do this, and do not do that"". So gradually the custom spread throughout the world of worshipping figures with various modes of worship, such as offering up sacrifices to them, and bowing down to them. As time passed, the honoured and revered Name of God was forgotten by mankind, vanished from their lips and hearts, and was no longer known to them. All the common people and the women and children knew only the figure of wood and stone, and the temple edifice in which they had, from their childhood, been trained to prostrate themselves to the figure, worship it and swear by its name. Even their wise men, such as priests and men of similar standing, also fancied that there was no other god but the stars and spheres, for whose sake and in whose similitude these figures had been made. But The Creator of the Universe was known to none, and recognised by none, save a few solitary individuals, such as Enosh, Methuselah, Noah, Shem and Eber. The world moved on in this fashion, till that Pillar of the World, the Patriarch Abraham, was born. After he was weaned, while still an infant, his mind began to reflect. By day and by night he was thinking and wondering: 'How is it possible that this (celestial) sphere should continuously be guiding the world and have no one to guide it and cause it to turn round; for it cannot be that it turns round of itself'. He had no teacher, no one to instruct him in aught. He was submerged, in Ur of the Chaldees, among silly idolaters. His father and mother and the entire population worshipped idols, and he worshipped with them. But his mind was busily working and reflecting till he had attained the way of truth, apprehended the correct line of thought and knew that there is One God, that He guides the celestial Sphere and created everything, and that among all that exist, there is no god beside Him. He realised that the whole world was in error, and that what had occasioned their error was that they worshipped the stars and the images, so that the truth perished from their minds. Abraham was forty years old when he recognised his Creator. Having attained this knowledge, he began to refute the inhabitants of Ur of the Chaldees, arguing with them and saying to them, ""The course you are following is not the way of truth"". He broke the images and commenced to instruct the people that it was not right to serve any one but the God of the Universe, to Whom alone it was proper to bow down, offer up sacrifices and make libations, so that all human creatures might, in the future, know Him; and that it was proper to destroy and shatter all the images, so that the people might not err like these who thought that there was no god but these images. When he had prevailed over them with his arguments, the king (of the country) sought to slay him. He was miraculously saved, and emigrated to Haran. He then began to proclaim to the whole world with great power and to instruct the people that the entire Universe had but one Creator and that Him it was right to worship. He went from city to city and from kingdom to kingdom, calling and gathering together the inhabitants till he arrived in the land of Canaan. There too, he proclaimed his message, as it is said ""And he called there on the name of the Lord, God of the Universe"" (Gen. 21:33). When the people flocked to him and questioned him regarding his assertions, he would instruct each one according to his capacity till he had brought him to the way of truth, and thus thousands and tens of thousands joined him. These were the persons referred to in the phrase, ""men of the house of Abraham"". He implanted in their hearts this great doctrine, composed books on it, and taught it to Isaac, his son. Isaac settled down, instructing and exhorting. He imparted the doctrine to Jacob and ordained him to teach it. He, too, settled down, taught and morally strengthened all who joined him. The patriarch Jacob instructed all his sons, set apart Levi, appointed him head (teacher) and placed him in a college to teach the way of God and keep the charge of Abraham. He charged his sons to appoint from the tribe of Levi, one instructor after another, in uninterrupted succession, so that the doctrine might never be forgotten. And so it went on with ever increasing vigour among Jacob's children and their adherents till they became a people that knew God. When the Israelites had stayed a long while in Egypt, they relapsed, learnt the practices of their neighbours, and, like them, worshipped idols, with the exception of the tribe of Levi, which steadfastly kept the charge of the Patriarch. This tribe of Levi never practised idolatry. The doctrine implanted by Abraham would, in a very short time, have been uprooted, and Jacob's descendants would have relapsed into the error and perversities universally prevalent. But because of God's love for us and because He kept the oath made to our ancestor Abraham, He appointed Moses to be our teacher and the teacher of all the prophets, and charged him with his mission. After Moses had begun to exercise his prophetic functions and Israel had been chosen by the Almighty as His heritage, he crowned them with precepts, and showed them the way to worship Him and how to deal with idolatry and with those who go astray after it."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.1","1. The essential principle in the precepts concerning idolatry is that we are not to worship any thing created—neither angel, sphere, star, none of the four elements, nor whatever has been formed from them. Even if the worshipper is aware that the Eternal is God, and worships the created thing in the sense in which Enosh and his contemporaries did, he is an idolater. It is against this that the Torah warns us when it says ""And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and seest the sun…. which the Lord, thy God hath alloted unto all the peoples"" (Deut. 4:19). This means that when your mind roams and you observe that the world is guided by these spheres and that God placed them in the world, as beings that live, endure permanently, and do not disintegrate, like all other things, you may say that it is proper to bow down to these spheres and worship them. Concerning this tendency, God commanded and said, ""Take heed lest your heart be deceived"" (Deut. 11:16); that is to say, do not be led astray by the fancies of your mind, to worship these beings as intermediaries between yourselves and the Creator."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.2","2. Many volumes have been composed by idolaters on idolatry, dealing with its essential principle, rites and rules. The Holy One, blessed be He, has enjoined us not to read these books, nor to meditate upon idol-worship, nor upon anything appertaining to it. It is even forbidden to gaze upon the picture of an idolatrous figure, as it is said ""Turn ye not unto the idols"" (Lev. 19:4). In this connection it is further said ""And that thou inquirest not after their gods, saying 'How do these nations serve'"" (Deut. 12:30). That means that you shall not enquire in regard to an idol, as to the mode of its worship, even if you are not worshipping it. For this would cause you to turn after it and do as the idolaters do, as the text continues ""Even so will I do likewise"" (Deut. 12:30)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.3","3. All these prohibitions come under one category—not to turn to idolatry. Whoever turns towards it, by an overt act, is punished with stripes. It is not only idolatry to which we must not turn in thought. We are likewise warned not to permit any thought to enter our minds, that might cause one to reject a fundamental principle of the Torah. We must not turn our minds to such a thought and thus be drawn after the imaginations of our hearts. For the mind is limited; not every mind is capable of attaining knowledge of the truth in its purity. If every man were to follow after the vagaries of his heart, the result would be universal ruin, ensuing from the limitations of the human intellect. How so ? Sometimes one will be drawn to idolatry. Sometimes he will waver in his mind concerning the Unity of God, as to whether He is One or He is not One. He will speculate on what is above (the visible universe), what below it, what existed before the Creation, what will exist after the world comes to an end. Sometimes he will muse concerning Prophecy, and say to himself 'Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is not'. Sometimes he will harbour similar doubts concerning the Torah as to whether it is of divine origin, or not. And such a person, being ignorant of the logical principles which need to be applied in order to attain positive truth, will lapse into heresy. In this regard, the Torah exhorted us ""And that ye go not about after your heart nor after your eyes, after which ye use to go astray"" (Num. 15:39). This means ""You shall not allow yourselves to be drawn, each one after his own limited intelligence, and imagine that his mind is attaining truth."" The sages thus explained the text quoted above (Num. 15:39); ""After your heart"" refers to heresy. ""After your eyes"" refers to lechery."" Although the violation of this prohibition may result in forfeiture of life hereafter, it is not punished with stripes. This is in accordance with the principle that an infraction which does not involve a physical act does not render one liable to that penalty."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.4","4. The precept relating to idolatry is equal in importance to all the other precepts put together, as it is said, ""And when ye shall err and not observe all these commandments"" (Num. 15:22). This text has traditionally been interpreted as alluding to idolatry; hence the inference that acceptance of idolatry is tantamount to repudiating the whole Torah, the prophets and everything that they were commanded, from Adam to the end of time, as it is said ""From the day that the Lord gave commandment and onward, throughout your generations"" (Num. 15:23). And whoever denies idolatry confesses his faith in the whole Torah, in all the prophets and all that the prophets were commanded, from Adam to the end of time. And this is the fundamental principle of all the commandments."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.5","5. An Israelite who worshipped an idol is regarded as an idolater in all respects and not as an Israelite who committed a transgression, the penalty for which is death by stoning. A pervert to idolatry is regarded as having renounced the whole of the Torah. So too, the infidels in Israel are in no wise to be regarded as Israelites; as it is said, ""None that go unto her return, neither do they attain the paths of life"" (Prov. 2:19). Infidels are those who, in respect to the follies of which we have spoken, go after the fancies of their hearts, till at last they become transgressors of the fundamental precepts of the Torah, in a spirit of defiance and arrogance, asserting that there is nothing wrong in what they do. It is forbidden to hold converse with them or give them any reply, as it is said, ""And come not nigh the door of her house"" (Prov. 5:8). The mind of the infidel tends towards idolatry."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.6","6. Whoever acknowledges that idolatry is true, even if he does not worship an idol, reviles and blasphemes the honoured and revered Name of God. The idolater and the blasphemer are in the same class, as it is said, ""But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a stranger, the same blasphemeth the Lord"" (Num. 15:30). Hence, the idolater is hanged, just as the blasphemer is hanged, both being previously stoned. I have accordingly included the law of the blasphemer among the laws of idolatry, since both the blasphemer and the idolater deny the fundamental principles of our religion."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.7","7. The following are the rules concerning the blasphemer. The blasphemer does not incur the penalty of death by stoning till he has pronounced the proper Name of God which is written <i>Aleph, Daleth Nun, Yod,</i> and cursed it, invoking one of the names of the Deity that may not be erased, as it is said ""And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord (shall be put to death) (Lev. 24:16). Blaspheming the Proper Name of God is punished by stoning; but one who blasphemes any of the attributive names of God, only violates a prohibition. One authority declares that the extreme penalty is incurred only when the Tetragrammaton (J.H.V.H.) is blasphemed. I am of the opinion that the blasphemer is stoned, who uses either of the Proper Names."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.8","8. Whence is the prohibition of blasphemy derived ? From the text ""Thou shalt not revile God"" (Ex. 22:27). The witnesses are examined day after day, using allusive terms such as the phrase ""Let José smite José"". When the trial is concluded, the Court is cleared and the senior witness is again questioned. The judges say to him 'declare what thou didst hear, explicitly'. He makes the declaration. The judges rise and rend their garments; these rents are never sewn up. The second witness then says 'I heard the same as he did'. If there were many witnesses, each of them has to declare, 'I heard the same as the previous witness'."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.9","9. If the blasphemer retracts the blasphemy, even immediately after it has been uttered, it is of no avail. One who blasphemed in the presence of witnesses is put to death by stoning. If one blasphemed the Name of God, invoking the name of an idol, zealots attack him and put him to death. If they have not slain him, and he appears before the Court, he is not stoned unless he has blasphemed, invoking one of the Proper Names of God."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.10","10. Whoever hears the Name of God blasphemed—even if it be one of the attributive Names—must rend his garments, provided that he hears the blasphemy uttered by an Israelite. Whether he hears it directly from the blasphemer, himself, or hears it reported by one who heard it from the blasphemer, he has to rend his garments. But one who hears a blasphemy uttered by an idolater is not obliged to rend his garments. The reason why Eliakim and Shebna rent their garments (when they heard Rabshakeh blaspheming) (II Kings ch. 18), was because Rabshakeh was an apostate. All the witnesses and judges place their hands, one after another, upon the head of the blasphemer and say to him 'Thy blood be upon thy head, for thou hast brought it on thyself'. Of all those, who are condemned to death by the Court, the blasphemer is the only one in whose case imposition of hands is required, as it is said, ""And let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head"" (Lev. 24:14)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.1","1. Whoever worships an idol of his own free will and wilfully, incurs the (divine) penalty of excision. If witnesses were present and there had been previous warning, he is stoned. If one worshipped an idol in error, he brings the prescribed sin-offering."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.2","2. Several modes of worship were instituted by the idolaters for each image and figure. The mode of worship for one idol is not the same as that for another idol. For example, the worship of Peor consists in indecent exposure of the person before the idol; the worship of Mercury consists in casting stones towards the idol or removing stones from before it. Many modes of worship, similar to these, were instituted for other idols. Hence, he who exposes his person in worship of Mercury or casts a stone before Peor, does not incur the penalty for idolatry. He is only liable, if he worships an idol in accordance with its special ritual, as it is said, ""How do these nations serve their gods ? Even so will I do likewise"" (Deut. 12:30). The Court must therefore be acquainted with the diverse idolatrous rituals, for no Israelite, (charged with worshipping an idol), is stoned, unless the Court knows that he observed the ritual appropriate to that idol."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.3","3. The prohibition of these and similar modes of worship is inferred from the text ""Nor serve them"" (Ex. 20:5). This refers to all modes of worship with the exception of bowing down, sacrificing, offering incense or libation. He who uses any of these modes in the worship of any idol is liable to the penalty for idolatry, even if such is not the mode of worship peculiar to the particular idol worshipped. For example, if one pours forth a libation to Peor, or sacrifices to Mercury, he is liable, as it is said ""He that sacrificeth unto the gods, save unto the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed"" (Ex. 22:19). Since sacrifice is included in the modes of worship, why is it especially mentioned in this text? To indicate that even as sacrifice is a mode of worship appropriate to the service of God, and one who offers up sacrifices to another deity incurs the penalty of stoning, irrespective of whether sacrifice is or is not the special mode of worshipping that particular deity, so every mode of worship appropriate to the service of God, if used in the worship of an idol,—whether that is or is not its special mode or worship—renders the worshipper liable as an idolater. It is therefore said, ""Thou shalt not bow down to another god"" (Ex. 34:14), in order to render one who bows down to an idol liable, even if such an act is not its mode of worship. The same rule applies to the offering of incense or libation. Sprinkling (of blood) and Pouring out Libations are regarded as identical."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.4","4. If one offers ordure to an idol, or makes a libation to it of a pot filled with urine, he is liable to the penalty for idolatry. One who slays a grasshopper (to an idol) is not liable, unless such is its mode of worship. Thus also, to slay a beast that is short of a limb (as a sacrifice to an idol), does not render the slayer liable unless this was its special mode of worship. If an idol is worshipped by means of a stick, one who broke a stick before it, is liable and the stick may not be used. But if one threw a stick before it, he is liable, but the stick is not inhibited from use. The reason for the distinction is that throwing a stick is not analogous to sprinkling blood; because the stick, after being thrown, is unimpaired, while the blood, after it had been sprinkled, has been dispersed. Whoever accepts any one of the various classes of idols as a god, incurs the penalty of stoning. Even if a man takes up a brick and addresses it thus: 'Thou art my god', or words of similar import, he is liable. And though he retracts immediately and adds 'This is not my god', his retraction is of no avail and he is stoned."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.5","5. Whoever worships an idol in accordance with its special ritual, even if he does so contemptuously, is liable. For example, if one exposes his person before Peor, in order to show contempt for it, or casts a stone towards Mercury to show his contempt for it, he is liable—these being the respective modes of worshipping those idols—and he should accordingly bring a sacrifice in atonement for his error."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.6","6. If one worships an idol, out of love, as for instance, if a particular image fills him with delight by its beautiful craftmanship, or, if one worships an idol, out of fear of it, because he apprehends that it might do him harm—like the idolaters who imagine that the idol has power to benefit or injure—he is liable to stoning, provided that he accepted it as a god. But if he worshipped it with the ritual peculiar to it, or with one of the four modes appropriate to the worship of God, and his motive is only love of the idol or fear of it, he is not liable. He who embraces an idol, kisses it, sweeps the ground or lays the dust in front of it, washes it, anoints it, clothes it, puts shoes on its feet, or performs similar offices of respect, violates a prohibition, for it is said, ""Nor serve them"" (Ex. 20:5). These acts come under the category of worship, but stripes are not inflicted for any of them, since they do not constitute worship explicitly. If any of these acts is a ritual peculiar to an idol, and one performs it with intent to worship, he is liable for idolatry."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.7","7. If a thorn lodged in a person's foot while he was standing in front of an idol, he is not to bend down in order to remove it, because it would look as if he were bowing down to the idol. If coins, belonging to a person, had been scattered in front of it, he is not to bend down to pick them up, because it would look as if he were bowing down to the idol. But he is to sit down and then extract the thorn or pick up the coins."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.8","8. Where there are figures in front of an idol, which discharge water, one may not place his mouth over the opening of any of them and drink, because it would look as if he were kissing an idol."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.9","9. If one acquires an idol for himself, he is punished with stripes, even though he did not make it with his own hand and did not worship it, as it is said, ""Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image nor any manner of likeness"" (Ex. 20:4). So too, if one makes an idol with his hands for others, even if he makes it for an idolater, he is punished with stripes, as it is said, ""Nor make unto yourselves molten gods"" (Lev. 19:4). Hence, one who makes an idol with his own hand and for himself, is punished with stripes twice."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.10","10. It is forbidden to make figures for purposes of ornament, even if they are not idolatrous, as it is said, ""Ye shall not make with Me gods of gold and silver"" (Ex. 20:23); that is to say, figures of gold and silver which only serve as ornaments; so that those likely to err shall not err and imagine that these figures serve idolatrous purposes. The prohibition of making ornamental figures only applies to representation of the human form. Hence, a figure of a human being must not be made in wood, clay or stone; provided that the figure is in high relief like sculptures and figures in palaces and the like places; and whoever makes such is punished with stripes. But if a figure is in bas-relief or painted, such as pictures on boards and tablets, or woven in tapestry—it is permitted."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.11","11. If a signet ring has a human figure on it, and the figure is in high-relief, it is forbidden to wear the ring, but it may be used as a seal. If the figure is in bas-relief, the ring may be worn but may not be used for sealing, because the impression it would make would be in high-relief. It is also forbidden to make figures of the sun, moon, stars, constellations, or angels, for it is said, ""Ye shall not make with Me"" (Ex. 20:20); that is, 'ye shall not make figures representing My ministers that minister before Me on high'; and such figures may not be made even on tablets. Figures of quadrupeds and of other animals—with the exception of Man,—and of trees and plants, etc., may be made, even if the figures are in relief."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.1","1. Those who seduce a city of Israel to idolatry are put to death by stoning, even if they themselves did not worship an idol but only seduced the inhabitants of their city to do so. The seduced inhabitants are put to death by the sword, provided that they worshipped an idol or accepted it as a god. Whence is the prohibition of seduction to idolatry inferred ? From the text ""Neither let it be heard out of thy mouth (Ex. 23:13)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.2","2. A city does not become a seduced city unless those who have led it astray belong to it and are of the same tribe as the rest of its inhabitants, as it is said, ""From the midst of thee, and they have drawn away the inhabitants of their city"" (Deut. 13:14); unless the seducers are two or more than two, as it is said ""Certain base <i>fellows</i> are gone out…. and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city"" (ibid 13:14); and unless those seduced are the majority of its inhabitants and number from one hundred up to the majority of the tribe. But if the majority of a tribe has been led astray, they are judged individually, as it is said, ""the inhabitants of that city"" (Deut. 13:16), that is, not of a small village nor of a large capital. A population of less than a hundred forms a small village and the majority of a tribe constitutes a large capital. So too, if women or children have seduced it, or a single male adult has done so, or a minority only of its inhabitants have been led astray, or if they have gone astray of themselves, or the seducers came from outside—in all these cases, the law of the seduced city is not applied to it; the inhabitants are regarded as individuals who have worshipped idolatry. Whoever has transgressed is put to death by stoning, while the transgressors' property passes to their heirs, as in the case of other malefactors, executed by sentence of a judicial court."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.3","3. A seduced city may only be tried by a Court of seventy-one judges, as it is said ""Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman who have done this evil thing unto thy gates"" (Deut. 17:5), which means that individual offenders are executed by the sentence of a court at the gate (Tribal court of twenty-three judges); but majorities of cities are only executed if tried and sentenced by the Supreme Court (Seventy-one judges)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.4","4. None of the Cities of Refuge (Num. 35:10-15), can ever become a seduced city, as it is said, ""in one of thy cities"" (Deut. 13:13). Nor can Jerusalem be condemned as a seduced city, since it had never been assigned to (any of) the tribes. A frontier town is never condemned as a seduced city, so that idolaters might not invade the Holy Land of Israel and destroy it. One court cannot declare three cities, adjacent to each other, to be seduced cities. But it may so declare them if they are at a distance from each other."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.5","5. A city is not declared a seduced city unless the seducers used the plural number and said to the inhabitants 'let us go and worship', 'let us go and sacrifice', 'let us go and pour out libations', 'let us go and bow down', or 'let us go and accept the idol as a god'; and the people gave heed and worshipped it with its special ritual; or in one of the four modes appropriate to the worship of God, or accepted the idol as a god. In a city where all these conditions have not been fulfilled by it and its seducers, how are the inhabitants to be treated ? Those who have worshipped idols are to be warned separately, and after testimony has been given of their persisting in idolatry, they are put to death by stoning as individuals who worshipped idols. Their property passes to their heirs."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.6","6. What is the procedure in the case of a seduced city, when it is in a condition to be declared a seduced city ? The Supreme Court sends a Commission, through whom it institutes an enquiry and inquisition, till the Judges are convinced on clear evidence that all or the greater part of that city's population have been led astray and relapsed into idolatry. Then they send to them two scholars to warn them and try to bring them back to the right path. If they repent, it is well. But if they persist in their folly, the Court charges all Israel to organise an expedition against them. They lay siege to, and wage war upon them till the city is taken by storm. After it has been taken, a large number of tribunals is set up to try the inhabitants. Any one against whom two witnesses come and testify that he worshipped idols, after having been warned, is set apart. If all who worshipped idols are found to be a minority of the inhabitants, they are stoned, and the rest are saved. If those who worshipped idols are found to be the majority, they are brought before the Supreme Court, where their trial is completed. All those who worshipped idols are put to death by decapitation. If it is found that all the inhabitants had worshipped idols, all human beings in the city, including women and children, are put to the sword. If a majority of the inhabitants had worshipped idols, the wives and children of the idolaters are slain with the sword. Whether the whole city or a majority of its inhabitants had been seduced, those who seduced them are put to death by stoning. All the property in the city is gathered into its broadway. If it has no broadway, a broadway is constructed for it. If its broadway is situated outside the city, an exterior wall is built, so as to enclose it within the city, as it is said, ""into the midst of the broad place thereof"" (Deut. 13:17). All living creatures in the city are slain and all other property, together with the district itself, is burnt. This destruction by fire is an affirmative precept, as it is said, ""And thou shalt burn with fire the city and all the spoil thereof"" (Deut. 13:17)."

Property belonging to the righteous men in the city, that is, those inhabitants who were not led astray with the majority, is burnt with the rest of the goods in the city; because they lived there, their property is destroyed. Whoever converts any portion of it, however small, to his use, is punished with the statutory (39) stripes; as it is said ""And there shall cleave naught of the devoted thing to thy hand"" (Deut. 13:18)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.8","8. If the witnesses, on whose evidence a city has been declared a seduced city, are found to have given false testimony, one who has taken possession of any portion of its property acquires the right to the same, and may convert it to his use—the reason being that the witnesses' testimony was refuted.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* And therefore the property need not be destroyed (as in paragraphs 6 and 7).</i> Why, however, did he acquire the right to the property ? The answer is that every owner of property in that city, immediately after conviction, divested himself of his ownership, by dereliction. The city is never rebuilt, and whoever rebuilds it, is punished with stripes, as it is said ""It shall not again be built"" (Deut. 13:17). But the site may be converted into gardens and parks, as it is said ""It shall not be built again""—which means that it may not be rebuilt as an inhabited district, such as it formerly had been."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.9","9. When a caravan, travelling from place to place, passed through a city that had been seduced and was also seduced with it, the members of the caravan are put to death by decapitation and their property is destroyed—provided that the caravan stayed in the city at least thirty days. Otherwise, they are put to death by stoning, and their property passes to their heirs."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.10","10. Property belonging to residents in another district, but deposited in the seduced city—even when responsibility for its safekeeping was assumed by citizens of the condemned city—is not burnt but reverts to the owners, as it is said, ""The spoil thereof"" (Deut. 13:17)—not the spoil of another district. Property owned by the wicked who were seduced, and which was deposited in another district, if it had been collected and placed with the property in the condemned city, is burnt with it. Otherwise it is not destroyed but passes to the heirs."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.11","11. A beast, half interest in which belongs to a seduced city (or a resident in it), while the other half is the property of another city, if found in the seduced city, may not be converted to private use. A mass of dough, similarly owned, may be used, because it is capable of partition."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.12","12. A beast owned by a seduced city, even after it had been ritually slaughtered, may not be converted to private use, as is the rule with an ox condemned to be stoned (Ex. 21:28-32) that had been ritually slaughtered. Natural hair of the men or women of the seduced city may be used. But the hair of a wig found there, comes within the category of ""the spoil thereof"" and may not be used."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.13","13. Fruits (of the field or orchard), not yet severed and found in the seduced city, may be enjoyed, as it is said, ""And thou shalt gather…. and shalt burn"" (Deut. 13:17). The text refers to that which only needs to be gathered and burnt, but not to fruits still attached (to the soil or tree), for these must be severed before they can be gathered and burnt. The same principle applies to the hair of the head, and, needless to add, to trees which are permitted to be used and become the property of the heirs. In regard to sanctified property, cattle set apart to be sacrificed on the altar are suffered to die a natural death, for ""the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination"" (Prov. 21:27). If they had been contributed to defray the cost of repairing the sacred edifice, they are to be redeemed, and then are burnt, as it is said ""The spoil thereof"" (Deut. 13:17), but not the possessions of God."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.14","14. The first born (of cattle) and the tithe of cattle found in the city, if without blemish, are treated like sacrifices for the altar, and suffered to die. If blemished, they are treated like the ordinary cattle of the city and are slain. Heave-offerings (Num. 18:11), found in it, which have passed into the possession of a priest, are to be left to rot, being his property. If they are still in the possession of the Israelite (owner of the produce) they should be given to a priest resident in another district, for they are God's property and intrinsically sacred."

"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.16","16. Whoever executes judgment on a seduced city performs a meritorious act, as much as one who offers up a burnt offering that is wholly consumed, as it is said, ""Every whit unto the Lord, thy God"" (Deut. 13:18). Yea more, he averts fierce wrath from Israel, as it is said, ""that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of his anger"" (ibid. 13:18); and brings blessing and mercy upon Israelites, as it is said ""And show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee"" (ibid. 13:18)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.1","1. He who entices an Israelite man or woman to idolatry is stoned, even though neither the enticer nor the enticed worshipped an idol, but because he gave instruction to worship an idol. And whether the enticer was a layman or a prophet, or whether only one person—male or female—was enticed or a number of persons were enticed, the punishment is death by stoning."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.2","2. He who entices the majority of the inhabitants of a city to idolatry is a seducer and is not styled an enticer. If the seducer of the majority of a city was a prophet, he is put to death by stoning, and those who were seduced are dealt with individually and not as inhabitants of a seduced city, unless there were at least two seducers. Whether one says ""The idol said to me 'worship ye it' "" or says ""the Holy One, blessed be He, said to me 'worship ye the idol' "", in either case, he is regarded as a prophet who seduced. And if the majority of the inhabitants of a city went astray after him, he is put to death by stoning. The enticer, whether he used the plural or singular number, is put to death by stoning. For instance, if one says to another, ""I will worship an idol""; ""I will go and worship""; let us go and worship with the ritual especially used for that particular idol""; ""I will sacrifice""; ""I will go and sacrifice""; ""let us go and sacrifice""; ""I will burn incense""; ""I will go and burn incense""; ""let us go and prostrate ourselves"";—in uttering any of these phrases, he is an enticer. If he enticed two persons, they act as the witnesses. They bring him to the Court and testify concerning him that he had so spoken to them, and he is put to death by stoning."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.3","3. For the conviction of an enticer, no previous warning is required. If he spoke to a single individual, that person should reply ""I have friends who desire this"". And it should be so contrived that the enticer shall make his attempt at seduction before two witnesses, which is necessary to secure his condemnation to death. If the enticer will not consent to entice two persons, it is a duty to secure the evidence of concealed witnesses. In no other class of capital offences but this, is recourse had to this method. What is the procedure ? The one whom he attempted to entice, brings two men, and stations them in a dark place where they can see the enticer and hear his words, while the enticer cannot see them. He then says to the enticer, ""Say again what you said to me privately"". After the enticer has done so, the one whom he sought to entice replies, ""How can we give up our God who is in Heaven, and go and and worship blocks of wood and stones ?"" If the enticer retracts or keeps silent, he is not liable. But if he says ""This is our duty, and this, it is right for us to do"", then those who stood at a distance bring him to the Court and he is put to death by stoning."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.4","4. The execution of the enticer devolves upon the one he attempted to entice, as it is said, ""Thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death"" (Deut. 13:10). The latter is forbidden to love the enticer, as it is said ""Thou shalt not consent unto him"" (Deut. 13:9). Since, in reference to an enemy, it is said ""Thou shalt surely release it with him"" (Ex. 23:5), it might be supposed that this person (the enticer) should also be helped. It is therefore said ""Nor hearken unto him"" (Ibid. 13:9). Since it is said, ""Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbour"" (Lev. 19:16), it might be supposed that you are not to stand idly by the blood of this man. It is therefore said ""Neither shall thine eye pity him"" (Deut. 13:9). The enticed must not seek to exculpate the enticer, as it is said ""Neither shalt thou spare"" (Deut. 13:9). And if he is aware of a ground for the enticer's condemnation, he must not refrain from declaring it, as it is said, ""Neither shalt thou conceal him"" (ibid. 13:9). Whence is the prohibition inferred, forbidding a layman to entice to idolatry ? From the text ""And all Israel shall hear and fear""<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* The prohibition is implicit in the conclusion of this text. ""And they shall not continue to do wickedness like this in thy midst.""</i> (Deut. 13:12)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.5","5. If one enticed others to worship him, and said to them ""worship me"", and they worshipped him, he is stoned; but he is not stoned if they did not worship him, even though they accepted his statement and said ""yes"".<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** They said it in derision.</i> But if he enticed people to the worship of another person or to any other form of idolatry, and the one he addressed accepted his teaching and said ""yes, let us go and worship"", even though the latter did not yet carry out his intention, both the enticer and the enticed are stoned, as it is said, ""Thou shalt not consent unto him nor hearken unto him"" (Deut. 13:9), implying that one who does consent and hearken is liable to punishment."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.6","6. What is meant by a prophet who prophesies in the name of idolatry ? He is one who asserts ""This particular idol or particular star told me that it is a duty to do this and this or not to do it'. Even if his statement coincided with the law, so that he declared unclean that which is actually unclean and pronounced clean that which is clean, he is put to death by strangling, provided that he had been warned in the presence of two witnesses, as it is said, ""or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die"" (Deut. 18:20). The prohibition is implied in the text ""And make no mention of the name of other gods"" (Ex. 23:13)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.7","7. It is forbidden to engage in a controversy with, or refutation of, one who prophesies in the name of idolatry. Nor is he asked for a sign or token. Should he, on his own initiative, perform such a sign, we pay no heed to it nor reflect upon it. Whoever gives consideration to such signs, (thinking) that possibly they are true, violates a prohibition, as it is said ""Thou shalt not hearken to the words of that prophet"" (Deut. 13:4). A false prophet is put to death by strangling, even though he prophesied in the name of the Lord, and neither added to, nor took aught away from His commandments, as it is said, ""But the prophet that shall speak a word presumptuously in My name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die"" (Deut. 18:20)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.8","8. Whether one prophesies what he has not received in a prophetic vision, or, having heard the words of another prophet, declares that the message was directly communicated to himself—in either case, he is a false prophet and is put to death by strangling."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.9","9. Whoever refrains from slaying a false prophet because of his high standing, his mode of life being consistent with the prophetic calling, violates a prohibition, as it is said, ""the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously; thou shalt not be afraid of him"" (Deut. 18:22). Likewise, whoever refrains from declaring grounds for his condemnation, or stands in fear and awe of his words, is included among those who transgress the prohibition ""Thou shalt not be afraid of him"" (Deut. 18.22). The false prophet may only be tried by the Court of seventy-one judges."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.10","10. He who makes a vow in the name of an idol or swears by it, is punished with stripes, as it is said, ""And make no mention of the name of other gods"" (Ex. 23:13); and this is so, irrespective of whether he swore by it for himself<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Swearing in the name of an idol to do something.</i> or for an idolater<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** Swearing in its name to induce an idolater to do something.</i>. It is also forbidden to cause an idolater to take an oath by his object of worship. The mention of the name of an idol, not by way of oath, is also forbidden, as it is said, ""Make no mention"" (Ex. 23:13)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.11","11. A person should not say to another ""wait for me beside that idol"", or give a similar direction. The names however of any idol mentioned in the Scriptures may be uttered, such as Peor, Bel, Nebo, Gad, etc. It is forbidden to give others an occasion to make vows or confirm them in the name of an idol. That person only is punished with stripes who himself makes or confirms a vow in the name of an idol, that is, swears by its name."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.1","1. One who practises communion with ghosts or familiar spirits of his own free will and presumptuously, incurs the penalty of excision. And if witnesses were present and a warning had been previously given, he is put to death by stoning. If the offence had been committed unwittingly, he brings the appointed sin-offering. How is communing with ghosts practised ? The practitioner stands up, offers a certain kind of incense, holds in his hand a myrtle twig, and waves it. He pronounces softly certain words known to the practitioners of this art, till the one who consults him fancies that someone is conversing with him, and answering his questions in words that sound as if they came from beneath the ground in exceedingly low tones almost inaudible to the ear and only apprehended by the mind. Or he takes a dead man's skull, burns incense to it and uses arts of divination till one hears a sound as if a voice, exceedingly low, came from under his armpit and replied to him—all acts of such nature constitute communion with ghosts. Whoever does any of these things is put to death by stoning."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.2","2. How is communion with spirits practised ? The practitioner puts the bone of a bird called <i>Yadua</i> into his mouth, offers up incense and performs other acts till he falls down like an epileptic and utters predictions of future events. All these are species of idolatry. Whence is it inferred that they are prohibited ? From the text ""Turn ye not unto the ghosts nor unto familiar spirits"" (Lev. 19:31)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.3","3. He who, of his own free will and presumptuously, offers any of his offspring to Molech, incurs the penalty of excision. If he does so unwittingly, he brings the appointed sin-offering. If the offence was committed in the presence of witnesses and after warning, he is put to death by stoning, as it is said ""Whosoever…. that giveth of his seed unto Molech shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones"" (Lev. 20:2). Whence is it inferred that this is prohibited ? From the text ""And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to make pass to Molech"" (Lev. 18:21), and it is further said, ""There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire"" (Deut. 18:10). What is the procedure ? A great fire is kindled. The father takes anyone of his offspring and delivers him to the priests who are fire worshippers. Those priests give back the son to the father, after he had been delivered into their hands, that he may be passed through the fire with his father's consent. The father it is who passes his son over the fire with the priest's permission. He makes his son walk through the flames on his feet, from one side to the other. Not that he burns the child in honour of Molech, as sons and daughters were burnt in the worship of another species of idolatry, but merely passing (the child) through the fire constituted the service of the idol called Molech. Therefore, he who performs this ritual to an idol other than Molech, is not liable."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.4","4. The penalty of excision or stoning is not incurred unless the father delivers his son to Molech and makes him pass through the fire on his feet, leading him through. If he delivered him to Molech but did not make him pass through the fire, or if he made him pass without having delivered him to Molech, or if he delivered him to Molech and made him pass through the fire but did not lead him through, he is not liable. Nor is he liable unless he delivers some of his offspring only and leaves the others, as it is said, ""Because he hath given of his seed to Molech""; ""of his seed"", but not all his seed."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.5","5. One is liable for leading any of his descendants through the fire to Molech, whether they are legitimate or illegitimate, whether sons or daughters, their children or grand-children, or any descendants—all these being included in one's offspring. But if he led his brothers, sisters, ancestors, or himself, through the fire to Molech, he is not liable; or if he led his offspring, while asleep or blind, he is not liable."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.6","6. The pillar, which the Torah forbids is a structure at which all gather, even if the purpose is to worship God, for such was the custom of the idolaters; as it is said, ""Neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar"" (Deut. 16:22). Whoever sets up such a pillar, is punished with stripes. So too, in regard to the ""figured stone"" mentioned in the Torah—any one who prostrates himself on it, even to worship the Lord, is punished with stripes, as it is said ""Neither shall ye place a figured stone in your land to bow down yourselves upon it"" (Lev. 26:1)—it having been the custom of idolaters to place a stone before an idol that the worshipers might prostrate themselves upon it. We may not do the like unto the Lord. One is however not punished with stripes unless he spreads out his hands and feet on the stone so that he lies completely stretched out across it. This is the prostration mentioned in the Torah."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.7","7. This rule applies to all territories except the Temple, where it is permitted to prostrate oneself on the stones, as it is said, ""in your land"" (Deut. 26:1), which means that in your land you may not prostrate yourself, but you may do so on the cut stones in the Temple. Hence, all Israelites have the custom to spread mats, or any kind of straw or stubble over the stone floors of synagogues, to serve as a partition between their faces and the stones. If a worshipper was unable to procure anything which would separate him from the stone, he should go elsewhere to prostrate himself, or turn on his side and incline, so that his face will not touch the stone."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.8","8. Whoever prostrates himself to God on cut stones without extending his hands and feet is not punished with the statutory stripes (for violating a scriptural prohibition) but receives stripes for contumacy. If however he prostrates himself to an idol, whether with hands and feet extended or not, he incurs the penalty of death by stoning, as soon as he put his face to the ground."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.9","9. He who plants a tree near the Altar or in any part of the Temple Court, whether the tree belongs to a species that does not bear fruit or is one that produces edible fruit, and even if he had planted it to adorn the Temple and enhance its beauty, is punished with stripes, as it is said, ""Thou shalt not plant thee an <i>Asherah</i> of any tree near unto the altar of the Lord, thy God"" (Deut. 16:21). The reason for the prohibition is that it had been the custom of idolaters to plant trees by the side of an idolatrous altar, so that people might assemble there."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.10","10. It is forbidden to erect wooden colonnades within the Temple, like those in courtyards, although they are built structures and not planted trees. The prohibition is an extreme precaution grounded on the terms of the phrase ""any wood"" (Deut. 16-21). All the colonnades and cornices projecting from the Temple walls were of stone and not of wood."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.1","1. An affirmative precept enjoins the destruction of any idol, articles subsidiary to its worship, and everything made for its sake, as it is said, ""Ye shall surely destroy all the places (wherein the nations that ye are to dispossess served their gods) (Deut. 12:2); and it is further said ""but thus shall ye deal with them, (ye shall break down their altars"") (ibid. 7:5). In the land of Israel, it is a duty actively to pursue idolatry till we have exterminated it from the whole of our country. Outside the Holy Land, however, we are not so commanded; but only that whenever we acquire any territory by conquest, we should destroy all the idols found there, as it is said, ""And ye shall destroy their name out of that place"" (Deut. 12:3); that is, in the Land of Israel, thou art enjoined actively to pursue them but not outside the Holy Land."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.2","2. An idol, articles subsidiary to its worship, sacrifices offered to it, and anything made for its sake, are forbidden to be used, as it is said, ""And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house"" (ibid. 7:26). Whoever makes use of any of these things is punished with stripes twice; once, for violating the prohibition ""thou shalt not bring etc."" (ibid. 7:26), and once, for violating the prohibition ""and there shall cleave naught of the devoted thing to thy hand"" (ibid. 13:18)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.3","3. No use may be made of a beast that has been wholly offered up to an idol. This prohibition applies to its dung, bones, horns, hoofs and hide, and every part of it. Hence, if a mark on the hide indicates that it came off a beast that had been offered up to an idol—as, for example, a circular perforation which idolaters used to make over the heart, through which that organ was extracted—all the hides with this characteristic are forbidden to be used. And so with all similar indications."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.4","4. What are the distinctions between an idol belonging to an idolater and one belonging to an Israelite ? An idol belonging to an idolater is forthwith prohibited to be used: as it is said, ""the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire"" (Deut. 7:25); as soon as it has been made, it becomes his god. But an idol, the property of an Israelite, is not prohibited till it has been worshipped, as it is said, ""and setteth it up in secret,"" (Deut. 27:15); that is, performs mysterious rites that constitute its mode of worship. Articles used in idolatrous worship, whether belonging to an idolater or to an Israelite, only become forbidden after they have been so used."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.5","5. Whoever makes an idol for others, although he is punished with stripes, is nevertheless permitted to use the remuneration for his labour—and this is so, even if he made the idol for an idolater, in which case it becomes forthwith prohibited. The reason is that an idol does not become forbidden till it is completed; and the last tap of the hammer is worth less than a <i>perutah</i> (the smallest coin). If one purchased broken metal from an idolater and found an idol among the pieces—even if the purchaser had already paid the price, provided that he has not yet taken possession of the article—he returns it to the idolater. The same is the rule if he had taken possession but had not paid the price; for, although taking possession affects transfer of property from a gentile, the case here is analogous to a purchase under error. If, however, he had paid the price and also taken possession, he should cast the idol into the Dead Sea. So where an idolater and a proselyte inherited the property of their father who had been an idolater, the proselyte may say to the idolater: ""Do thou take the idol and I will take money; do thou take the prohibited wine and I will take fruit."" Once, however, these (prohibited articles) have come into the proselyte's possession, they are forbidden to be used."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.6","6. Figures made by gentiles as ornaments are permitted to be used, but those which they made for worship are forbidden. For example, all figures found in villages are forbidden, on the presumption that they were made for worship. But as for those in a city, if they are placed at the city gates, and the hand of the figure holds the form of a staff, bird, globe, sword, crown or ring, the presumption is that such a figure was erected for worship, and its use is forbidden. Otherwise, the figure is presumed to be ornamental and its use is permitted."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.7","7. Images, found discarded in the streets or among broken metal, may be used; needless to add, this is the rule also in the case of fragments. But if one finds a hand of an idol or its foot or any of its limbs, discarded, it is forbidden to be used. For as it is known for certain that the limb was part of a figure that had been worshipped, its prohibited status continues till one is sure that the gentiles annulled it as an object of worship."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.8","8. If one finds articles bearing the figure of the sun, moon, or dragon, whether they are gold or silver vessels or robes of scarlet embroidered with any such figure, or earrings or finger rings so engraved, they are forbidden to be used. Other articles with these figures are permitted, the presumption being that the figures are ornamental. Other figures than those enumerated, on any vessels, are presumed to be ornamental, and the vessels may be used."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.9","9. An idol, anything subsidiary to its service, or anything offered to it, however small, inhibits the use of objects with which it had become so completely mixed up that its identity is lost. For example, if an idol became mixed up with ornamental figures, even if it be but one idol among many thousands of such figures, all have to be destroyed<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Literally: cast into the Dead Sea.</i><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Literally: cast into the Dead Sea.</i>. So, if a cup used in idolatry had become mixed up with a large number of cups, or a piece of meat of an idolatrous sacrifice has become mixed up with several pieces of other meat, they must all be destroyed. So too, if a hide that had been perforated over the heart, had been mixed up with many hides (and cannot be identified), all the hides are forbidden. If one transgressed and sold an idol or any of its utensils, or anything offered to it, the monetary proceeds received are forbidden to be used; and, as in the case of the idol itself, any portion of those proceeds, however small it is, renders all monies with which it is mixed up, likewise forbidden; as it is said, ""And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house and be accursed like unto it"" (Deut. 7:26). Whatever thou obtainest from an idol, or from its utensils or from its offerings is forbidden like the idol itself."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.10","10. When an idol or an idolatrous tree has been burnt, its ashes are forbidden to be used. The live ember of an idol is forbidden, but the flame may be used, because it is without substance. Where it is doubtful whether an object is idolatrous, it may not be used. But where there is a double doubt,<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** That is, when it is doubtful whether the article in question even belongs to a group of objects any of which is only doubtfully idolatrous.</i> it may be used. For example, a cup used in idolatrous worship was inadvertently dropped into a store full of cups (and cannot be identified);—all the cups are forbidden to be used, on the principle that an idol or any one of its subsidiary articles, however small, renders everything with which it has become mixed up, forbidden. But if one of these cups was afterwards removed and became mixed up with two other cups, all three are permitted. If a ring belonging to an idol became mixed up with several rings, and two of these fell into the ocean, all the rest are permitted to be used, on the assumption that the idolatrous ring was one of the two that were lost. If it was mixed up with one hundred rings which were subsequently divided into two lots—forty in one, sixty in the other—and the forty accidentally became mixed up with other rings, all in this lot are permitted to be used—it being assumed that the idolatrous ring was in the larger original lot. If the sixty rings became mixed up with other rings, all are prohibited."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.11","11. Whether an idolatrous tree was itself worshipped or an idol was placed beneath it—in either case it is forbidden to sit in the shadow cast by its trunk.

But eggs as well as unfledged birds that still need the mother-bird, are forbidden to be taken and used, because the idolatrous tree is, as it were their ""base"". The nest itself, situated on the tree top, is permitted, because the bird has brought its constituents from elsewhere."

Then it should be heated with other wood that is lawful, after which, bread may be baked in it. Bread baked in it before it had cooled, may not be used. If it became mixed up with other loaves, the price of the forbidden bread must be cast into the sea, so that one does not enjoy any of it, while the loaves are permitted to be used."

If such cloth became mixed up with other pieces of cloth, its price is to be cast into the sea and all the pieces of cloth may be used. Vegetables may be planted beneath an idolatrous tree, whether in summer, when they need shade, or in the rainy season; the reason being that both the forbidden shade of the idolatrous tree, and the soil which has not become forbidden, cause the vegetables to grow, and a product of two factors, of which one is forbidden while the other is permitted, is always permitted. Accordingly, a field fertilised with manure belonging to an idol, may be sown. A cow, fattened with vetches belonging to an idol, may be used for food. And so, in similar cases."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.15","15. Meat, wine or fruit, set aside to be offered up to an idol, does not become forbidden, even after having been brought into the idolatrous temple, till it has been actually presented to the idol. Once this has been done, it is regarded as an idolatrous offering; and even if it is again taken out, it remains for ever forbidden. Any thing found in an idolatrous temple, even water or salt, is, by scriptural enactment, forbidden to be used, and one who partakes of it, in the minutest quantity, is punished with stripes."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.16","16. A garment, utensils or coins on the hand of an idol, if found in a position betokening contempt, may be used; if the position indicates respect, they are forbidden to be used. For instance, a purse found suspended about its neck, a garment folded and lying upon its head or a vessel leaning over its head, may be used, because the position indicates contempt, and so in similar cases. If the article found on its head is such that the like of it is offered up on the altar, it is forbidden to be used. These distinctions only apply to things found outside the place of worship. But if one found any such thing within an idolatrous place of worship, whether in a position indicating respect or contempt, whether it is suitable to be offered up on the altar or not—in short, whatever is found within such a place, even if it be only water or salt, is forbidden to be used. In the case of Peor and Mercury, anything found with them, within or without their respective places of worship, is forbidden to be used. This too is the rule with regard to the stones of Mercury; a stone that evidently belongs to it is forbidden to be used."

A bath or a garden belonging to an idol may be used, if no gratuity need be given, but may not be so used, if such has to be given.

"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.18","18. One may bathe in a bathhouse where there is an idol; because it has been set up there as an ornament and not to be worshipped, as it is said, ""their gods"" (Deut. 7:16); that is, when they are honoured as gods, not however, when they are treated with contempt, as in this case where the idol stands over the drains, and everyone urinates before it. But if such constituted its mode of worship, it is forbidden to enter such a place."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.19","19. If a knife belonging to an idol had been used to slaughter a beast, the carcase is permitted, because the act of slaughtering caused the beast to depreciate in value. But if the animal had been dangerously ill, the carcase is forbidden, because the value of the beast has been enhanced, and this enhancement is due to the use of a utensil belonging to an idol. So too, one may not cut meat with such a knife. But if the meat is cut in such a way as to spoil and destroy it, it is permitted."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.8.1","1. Anything which cannot be handled or made by a human being, even though it is worshipped, is permitted to be used. Hence, mountains and hills, trees originally planted for their fruit, public springs and cattle, though worshipped by idolaters, are permitted to be used. Fruits that had been worshipped, while they were unsevered, may be eaten as also flesh of a beast that had been worshipped. Needless to add, a beast that had only been set apart for idolatrous purposes may be eaten, whether it had been set apart to be worshipped or to be offered up as a sacrifice. The rule that the beast does not become forbidden to be used, applies if one had done nothing to it for the sake of idolatry. But if one has done anything to it, however insignificant, he renders it forbidden. For example, if one slaughters a beast and severs either of its vessels (the trachea or oesophagus) for the sake of idolatry, or exchanges it for an object of idolatrous worship, he renders it forbidden. Such is also the rule if one exchanges it for something for which an idolatrous object had been exchanged; for all the things successively exchanged have become monetary equivalents of an idolatrous object. These rules only apply to a beast that is the property of the individual who did these acts. But if one slaughters, with idolatrous intent, a beast belonging to another person, or exchanges it for an object of idolatrous worship, it does not become forbidden, since a person cannot cause that which is not his property to become forbidden. A man who prostrates himself to the soil in its natural state does not render in forbidden. But he renders it forbidden, if he digs in it pits, ditches or caves."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.8.2","2. If one prostrates himself to water carried by a wave, he does not render it forbidden. But if one took water in his hand and prostrated himself to it, he renders it forbidden. Mountain rocks that have become loosened and have been worshipped while still in their original situation, are permitted to be used, because they have not been handled by a human being."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.8.3","3. If an Israelite set up a brick, in order to worship it, but did not do so, and a gentile came and prostrated himself before it, he renders it forbidden to be used, the setting up constituting the act (requisite to show the Israelite's intent that is should be worshipped).<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Otherwise, the gentile could not render prohibited that which does not belong to him (VII. 4).</i> So too, if he set up an egg and a Gentile came and prostrated himself before it, he renders it forbidden to be used. If he cut a pumpkin or any thing similar, and worshipped it, he renders it forbidden to be used. If he worshipped half a pumpkin while the other half is still attached to it, the latter is forbidden to be used; because it is uncertain whether it is to be regarded as accessory to the half that was worshipped. A tree that was planted, from the outset, for the purpose of being worshipped, is forbidden to be used. This is the <i>Asherah,</i> mentioned in the Torah. If a tree had already been planted, and then was cut down and trimmed to serve as an idol, or even if a branch of it was forced into the ground and covered with soil or if it was grafted on another tree, and in either case produced twigs, these twigs are to be severed and are forbidden to be used, but the rest of the tree is permitted. So too, if any one worships a tree, although its trunk does not become forbidden, all twigs, leaves, shoots, and fruit which it produces, during the time that it is worshipped, are forbidden to be used. If Gentiles guard the fruit of a tree, declaring that it is intended to be converted into strong drink for a certain idolatrous temple, and they actually do make a strong drink of the fruit and drink it on their feast, the tree is forbidden to be used, because it is assumed to be an <i>Asherah</i> (idolatrous tree) and they deal thus with its fruit, because such is the ordinance of the <i>Asherah.</i>"
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.8.4","4. A tree, beneath which an idol was set up, may not be used, as long as the idol is there. Once the idol has been removed, the tree is permitted to be used, because it is not the object worshipped. A house which a gentile erected, with the original intent that it be worshipped, or a house already erected, that anyone worships, is forbidden to be used. If it had already been erected and was, for idolatrous purposes, plastered and ornamented so that it was renovated, the renovation is to be removed and may not be used, because it was made for idolatrous worship, but the rest of the structure is permitted to be used. If an idol was brought into a house—as long as it is there, the house is forbidden to be used; after it has been removed, the house may again be used. A stone, originally hewed to be worshipped, is forbidden to be used. If it had already been hewed and was then painted and decorated, that it might be worshipped, even if the decorations are in the stone itself and, needless to say, if these are only superficial, the added decorations are to be removed and are forbidden, since they were made for worship, but the rest of the stone is permitted to be used."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.8.5","5. A stone upon which an idol was set may not be used as long as the idol is on it. After the idol had been removed, it may be used. If one owned a house adjoining an idolatrous temple, and the house fell down, it may not be rebuilt. How should the owner act ? He should withdraw within the bounds of his own property and there rebuild the dwelling. The intervening empty space should be filled up with thorns or dirt, so that the area of the idolatrous temple will not be enlarged. If there was a party wall belonging to him and to the idol, he should consider the wall as divided in halves. The half on his side may be used. That on the side of the idol is wholly forbidden. Its stones, wood and earth are all forbidden to be used."

An idol belonging to idolaters which they had annulled (repudiated as an object of worship), before it passed into an Israelite's possession, may be used, as it is said ""the images of their gods ye shall burn with fire"" (Ibid. 7:25); that it is to say, only if they are treated as divine at the time when they come into our hands, are they to be destroyed, but if the idolaters had already declared them null, they are permitted to be used."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.8.9","9. An idol belonging to an Israelite can never be nullified. Even if an idolater is part-owner, the latter's nullification is of no avail, but it remains for ever forbidden to be used and must be concealed. So too, if an idol belonging to an idolater came into an Israelite's possession and was subsequently nullified by the idolater, the nullification is of no avail; the idol remains for ever forbidden. An Israelite cannot nullify an idol even with the idolater's permission. An idolater, who is a minor or mentally defective, cannot nullify an idol. If an idolater nullified an idol, belonging to him or to other idolaters, even if he did so under duress, and even if it was an Israelite that forced him, the object loses its idolatrous character, provided that the gentile who annulled it is actually an idol-worshipper. Nullification by one not actually an idol-worshipper is of no avail. The nullification of an idol nullifies its accessories. If the accessories were nullified, they may be used, but the idol itself remains forbidden as hitherto, until it has been nullified. Offerings to an idol can never be nullified."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.8.10","10. How does one nullify an idol ? If one chipped the tip of its ear, the tip of its nose, or its finger-tip, hammered in its face, even without loss of substance, or sold it to an Israelite who is a worker in metals, it is nullified. But if one pledged it or sold it to an idolater, or to an Israelite who is not a metal worker, or if <i>débris</i> fell upon it which the owner did not clear away, or if it had been stolen by robbers and no attempt has been made to reclaim it, or if one expectorated or urinated before it, or dragged it or threw ordure at it, it is not nullified."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.8.11","11. An idol abandoned by its worshippers during a time of peace is permitted to be used, because it has been nullified (by the abandonement). If this has taken place in wartime, it remains forbidden, because the abandonment was on account of the war. If an idol had got broken of itself, its fragments are forbidden to be used, until the idol is nullified. Hence, if one finds fragments of an idol, they may not be used, for possibly the idolaters had not nullified it. If it consisted of parts that an unskilled person can put together, each of them must be separately nullified. If an unskilled person cannot put them together, the nullification of any limb of the idol makes all the fragments null."

What is the distinction between a hearth and an altar ? A hearth consists of a single stone; an altar, of many stones. How are the stones of the idol Mercury nullified ? As soon as an idolater has used them in erecting a building or in paving a road, and so forth, they are permitted to be used. How is the <i>Asherah</i> (an idolatrous tree) nullified ? As soon as the idolater plucked a leaf from it, cut off one of its shoots, took from it a stick or rod, or removed the bark when this was not necessary, it loses its idolatrous character. If this procedure was needed by the tree, it remains prohibited, but the shavings are permitted to be used. If the tree belonged to an Israelite, whether the scraping was necessary or not, the tree as well as the shavings are for ever forbidden to be used, because the idol of an Israelite can never lose its idolatrous character."

Three days before the idolaters' feast, it is forbidden to buy of them or sell to them anything durable; likewise to borrow of them or lend to them; repay to them money that had been borrowed or exact from them payment of a loan, secured by deed or pledge; but the payment of a personal loan (for which there is no pledge or deed) may be exacted, as it is equivalent to recovering from them what might otherwise be lost. Perishable products, such as vegetables or cooked food, may be sold to them, up to the day of their feast. These restrictions apply to Palestine. In other countries, they are only enforced on the feast day. If these rules were violated, and one engaged in commercial transactions with them during these three days, the proceeds may be used.

The day on which idolaters meet to appoint a king, when they offer up sacrifices and sing hymns to their idols, is a feast day for them, just like their other feasts. But if an idolater institutes a personal feast day, an which he thanks his idol and lauds it, such as on his birthday, or the day when he trims his beard or the locks of his head, lands after a sea voyage, leaves prison, or gives a banquet in honour of his son, and so forth, commercial and social intercourse is only prohibited on that day, and only with that individual. So too, if idolaters, who have suffered a bereavement, keep the day of death as a solemn day, the prohibition only applies to intercourse with the individuals who so observe it, and is limited to the day. Whenever, in connection with a death, utensils are burnt and incense is offered up, it is certain that idolatry forms an element in the obsequies. Commercial and social intercourse on a feast day is prohibited with those only who worship an idol on that day, but is permitted with those who make merry and eat and drink on it, observing the day as a custom or keeping it out of respect to the sovereign, but not accepting it as a religious feast."

But if the gentile explicitly states that he buys them for idolatrous purposes, they may not be sold to him, unless first rendered unfit to be offered up to the idol; for the gentiles do not offer up to an idol any thing defective."

This however, only applies to purchases from a private individual who does not pay market dues. But purchases from a dealer are forbidden to be used, since the dealer pays toll which goes to the idol; and so the purchaser is benefiting idolatry.

If an Israelite is proceeding to an idolatrous shrine, one may do business with him while he is on his way thither, for possibly he may turn back; but it is not permitted when he is returning.

If he was observed to be dying, he is not to be rescued. It is forbidden however, actively to destroy him, or thrust him into a pit or do any thing similar, since he is not waging war against us.

But at no time do we give them a double greeting,<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** Peace, peace be unto thee' (I Chron. 12:19).</i> nor do we enter an alien's home on his festival in order to greet him.

The foregoing rules apply to the time when the people of Israel live exiled among the nations, or when the gentile's power is predominant. But when Israel is predominant over the nations of the world, we are forbidden to permit a gentile who is an idolater to dwell among us. He must not enter our land, even as a temporary resident; or even as a traveller, journeying with merchandise from place to place, till he has undertaken to keep the seven precepts which the Noachides were commanded to observe; as it is said, ""They shall not dwell in thy land"" (Ex. 23:33)—even for a time. If he undertakes to observe these seven precepts, he becomes a denizen proselyte.

These texts all refer to one theme and warn against imitating them. The Israelite shall, on the contrary, be distinguished from them and recognisable by the way he dresses and in his other activities, just as he is distinguished from them by his knowledge and his principles. And thus is it said, ""And I have set you apart from the peoples"" (Lev. 20:26). He shall not put on a garment like that specially worn by them nor let the lock of his hair grow in the way they do. Thus, he shall not cut the hair of the head at the sides, leaving the hair in the centre untouched as they do—this is called ""growing the forelock"". Nor shall he cut the hair in front from ear to ear, leaving the hair at the back to grow, as they do. He shall not rear edifices resembling idolatrous temples for the gathering of multitudes, as they do. Whoever does any of these or similar things is punished with stripes."

One who does any act, so that he may fall into an ecstatic state and his mind be withdrawn from all externals, after which he foretells future events, saying ""This will, or will not, come to pass"", or ""It is proper to do this"", or ""Beware of doing that"". Some diviners make use of sand or stones; one bends down to the earth and screams; another fixes his gaze on a brass mirror or a lamp; and then they imagine things and speak accordingly. Another carries a staff in his hand, leans on it and strikes with it till his mind is in a state of abstraction and then he speaks; the prophet refers to this when he says, ""My people ask counsel of their stock and their staff declareth unto them"" (Hosea. 4:12)."

The charmer, while speaking, holds, in his hand, a key, stone or other objects—all this is forbidden. The charmer himself who held any object in his hand or did any act beside speaking, even if he only pointed with his finger, is punished with stripes according to the Scriptural statute, as it is said ""There shall not be found among you …. a charmer"" (Deut. 18:11). But if he only uttered words, and neither moved his finger nor his hand nor held any thing in his hand, he, as well as the person over whom the charmer uttered those sounds and who sits in his presence, fancying that he is deriving some benefit, are punished with stripes for contumacy; the latter because he took part in the charmer's folly.

These practices are all false and deceptive, and were means employed by the ancient idolaters to deceive the peoples of various countries and induce them to become their followers. It is not proper for Israelites who are highly intelligent to suffer themselves to be deluded by such inanities or imagine that there is anything in them, as it is said ""For there is no enchantment with Jacob, neither is there any divination with Israel"" (Num. 23:23); and further, ""For these nations that thou art to dispossess hearken unto sooth-sayers and unto diviners; but as for thee, the Lord, thy God, hath not suffered thee so to do"" (Deut. 18:14). Whoever believes in these and similar things and, in his heart, holds them to be true and scientific and only forbidden by the Torah, is nothing but a fool, deficient in understanding, who belongs to the same class with women and children whose intellects are immature. Sensible people, however, who possess sound mental faculties, know by clear proofs that all these practices which the Torah prohibited have no scientific basis but are chimerical and inane; and that only those deficient in knowledge are attracted by these follies and, for their sake, leave the ways of truth.

The corners of the head are not be shaved as the idolaters and their priests used to do, as it is said ""ye shall not round the corners of your heads"" (Lev. 19:27). One incurs a separate penalty for each corner. Accordingly, if one shaves both temples, even at one time and after one warning, he is punished with stripes twice. Whether he shaves the corners only, leaving the rest of the head untouched, or shaves the entire head at one time, he is punished with stripes, because he shaved the corners. The liability attaches to the man who shaves. But the man who is shaved is not punished with stripes, unless he assisted the barber. One who shaves the corners of a male child's head is punished with stripes."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.12.2","2. A woman who shaves the corner of a man's head, or had the corner of her head shaved is not liable, for it is said, ""ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corner of thy beard"" (Lev. 19:27). Whoever is bound by the latter prohibition, is bound by the former. And since the latter prohibition cannot apply to a woman, neither does the former apply to her. Hence, (non-Israelite) male slaves of an Israelite, because they have beards, are forbidden to round the corners of their heads."

There are five parts of the beard that must not be removed; the hair upon the upper and the lower jaw, on the right as well as on the left side, and the peak of the beard. Removal of the hair at any one of these places involves the penalty of stripes. If one removes all of them at one operation, he is punished five times, but only if he uses a razor; as it is said, ""thou shalt not mar the corner of thy beard"" (Lev. 19:27), which refers to the use of the razor—this involving complete destruction of the hair, but there is no liability for cutting the beard with scissors.

This rule is limited to localities where women alone remove this hair—the object being to prevent a man trimming himself in a fashion peculiar to women. But in localities where it is customary for members of both sexes to remove hair of this description, a man who does so, is not punished with stripes.

In these respects, the custom of the country governs. A man who has put on women's adornments or a woman who has adorned herself in the modes peculiar to men, is punished with stripes. Whoever plucks out white hairs in his beard or in his head from among the dark, is punished with stripes—even if he has removed only one hair—the offence being the use of adornments peculiar to women. So too, one who dyes his hair a dark colour, even if he has only dyed a single white hair, is punished with stripes. One whose sex is undetermined and an hermaphrodite may not put on woman's apparel nor cut the hair of their heads in men's fashion; but if they do so, they are not punished with stripes."

Tattooing, mentioned in the Torah (Lev. 19:28), consists in cutting the flesh and filling up the cut with pigment, ink or other printing matter which leaves an indelible mark. This was a custom of the heathens who used so to mark themselves for idolatry, as much as to say that the tattooed was a slave sold to the idol and marked for its service. As soon as one prints with any material that leaves an indelible mark, having previously made an incision in any part of the body, whether it be a man or woman, that person incurs the punishment of stripes. If he wrote on the flesh (by incision), without marking with printing matter, or marked with printing matter without writing (by incision), he is not liable. He is only liable if he has written (by incision) and made tattooing marks, as it is said, ""nor print any marks"" (Lev. 19:28). This rule applies to the tattooer, but the person whose flesh is tattooed is not liable unless he assisted by some act. If he did nothing, he is not punished with stripes."

Kings 18:28). This procedure too was forbidden by the Torah, as it is said, ""ye shall not cut yourselves"" (Deut. 14:1). There is this distinction however. Where the incision was for the dead, whether it was done with the hand or with an instrument, the offender is punished with stripes.

He is liable for making a bald spot in any part of his head just as much as if he made it in a line with the part which is between the eyes, as it is said, ""They shall not make baldness upon their head"" (Lev. 21:5).

But it is a duty of the father to teach his young son Torah; as it is said, ""And ye shall teach them, to your children, talking of them"" (Deut. 11:19). A woman is under no obligation to teach her son, since only one whose duty it is to learn has a duty to teach."

Just as it is a man's duty to teach his son, so it is his duty to teach his grandson, as it is said, ""Make them known unto thy children and thy children's children"" (Deut. 4:9). This obligation is to be fulfilled not only towards a son and grandson. A duty rests on every scholar in Israel to teach all disciples (who seek instruction from him), even if they are not his children, as it is said, ""And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children"" (Deut. 6:7). On traditional authority, the term ""thy children"" includes disciples, for disciples too are called children, as it is said ""And the sons of the prophets came forth"" ((II Kings 2:3). This being so, why does the precept (concerning instruction) specifically mention (Deut. 4:9) a man's son and son's son ? To impress upon us that the son should receive instruction in preference to a grandson, and a grandson in preference to another man's son."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.1.3,"3. A father (who cannot teach his son) is bound to engage a paid teacher for him. But the only obligation one owes to a neighbour's son is to teach him when it involves no expense. If a father has not had his son taught, it is the duty of the latter, as soon as he realises his deficiencies, to acquire knowledge for himself, as it is said, ""That ye may learn them and observe to do them"" (Deut. 5:1). And so too, you will find that study in all cases takes precedence of practice, since study leads to practice, but practice does not lead to study."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.1.4,"4. If a man needs to learn Torah and has a son who needs instruction, his own requirements are to be satisfied first. But if his son has better capacity and greater ability to grasp what he learns, then the son's education takes precedence. Still, even in this case, the father must not wholly neglect the study of the Torah. For, just as it is incumbent on him to have his son taught, so is he under an obligation to obtain instruction for himself."

Later on, according to the child's capacity, the father should teach him a few verses at a time, till he attains the age of six or seven years, when he should take him to a teacher of young children."

If it is the custom of the country for a teacher of children to receive remuneration, the father is to pay the fee, and it is his duty to have his son taught, even if he has to pay for the instruction, till the child has gone through the whole of the Written Law. Where it is the custom to charge a fee for teaching the Written Law, it is permissible to take payment for such instruction. It is forbidden however to teach the Oral Law for payment, for it is said ""Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as the Lord, my God, commanded me"" (Deut. 4:5). This means: ""Even as I (Moses) learnt (from God) without payment, so have ye learnt from me, gratuitously. And throughout the generations, whenever you teach, do so gratuitously, even as you learnt from me"". If a person cannot find any one willing to teach him without remuneration, he should engage a paid teacher, as it is said ""Buy the truth"" (Prov. 23:23). It should not however be assumed that it is permissible to take pay for teaching. For the verse continues ""And sell it not"", the inference being, that even where a man had been obliged to pay for instruction (in the Oral Law), he is nevertheless forbidden to charge, in his turn, for teaching it."

Every Israelite is under an obligation to study Torah, whether he is poor or rich, in sound health or ailing, in the vigour of youth or very old and feeble. Even a man so poor that he is maintained by charity or goes begging from door to door, as also a man with a wife and children to support, are under the obligation to set aside a definite period during the day and at night for the study of the Torah, as it is said ""But thou shalt meditate therein day and night"" (Joshua 1:8)."

A third should be devoted to the Written Law; a third to the Oral Law; and the last third should be spent in reflection, deducing conclusions from premises, developing implications of statements, comparing dicta, studying the hermeneutical principles by which the Torah is interpreted, till one knows the essence of these principles, and how to deduce what is permitted and what is forbidden from what one has learnt traditionally. This is termed Talmud."

For example, if one is an artizan who works at his trade three hours daily and devotes nine hours to the study of the Torah, he should spend three of these nine hours in the study of the Written Law, three in the study of the Oral Law, and the remaining three in reflecting on how to deduce one rule from another. The words of the Prophets are comprised in the Written Law, while their exposition falls within the category of the Oral Law. The subjects styled <i>Pardes</i> (Esoteric Studies), are included in <i>Talmud.</i> This plan applies to the period when one begins learning. But after one has become proficient and no longer needs to learn the Written Law, or continually be occupied with the Oral Law, he should, at fixed times, read the Written Law and the traditional dicta, so as not to forget any of the rules of the Torah, and should devote all his days exclusively to the study of Talmud, according to his breadth of mind and maturity of intellect."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.1.13,"13. A woman who studies Torah will be recompensed, but not in the same measure as a man, for study was not imposed on her as a duty, and one who performs a meritorious act which is not obligatory will not receive the same reward as one upon whom it is incumbent and who fulfills it as a duty, but only a lesser reward. And notwithstanding that she is recompensed, yet the Sages have warned us that a man shall not teach his daughter Torah, as the majority of women have not a mind adequate for its study but, because of their limitations, will turn the words of the Torah into trivalities. The sages said ""He who teaches his daughter Torah—it is as if he taught her wantonness"" This stricture refers only to instruction in the Oral Law. With regard to the Written Law, he ought not to teach it to her; but if he has done so, it is not regarded as teaching her wantonness."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.2.1,"1. Teachers of young children are to be appointed in each province, district and town. If a city has made no provision for the education of the young, its inhabitants are placed under a ban, till such teachers have been engaged. And if they persistently neglect this duty, the city is excommunicated, for the world is only maintained by the breath of school children."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.2.2,"2. Children are to be sent to school at the age of six or seven years, according to the strength of the individual child and its physical development. But no child is to be sent to school under six years of age. The teacher may chastise his pupils to inspire them with awe. But he must not do so in a cruel manner or in a vindictive spirit. Accordingly, he must not strike them with whips or sticks, but only use a small strap. He is to teach them the whole day and part of the night, so as to train them to study by day and by night. And there is to be no holiday except on the eve of the Sabbath or festival, towards the close of the day, and on festivals. On Sabbaths, pupils are not taught a new lesson, but they repeat what they had already learnt previously, even if only once. Pupils must not be interrupted at their studies, even for the re-building of the Temple."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.2.3,"3. A teacher who leaves the children and goes out (when he should be teaching them), or does other work while he is with them, or teaches lazily, falls under the ban ""Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord with a slack hand"" (Jer. 48:10). Hence, it is not proper to appoint any one as teacher unless he is God-fearing and well versed in reading and in grammar."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.2.4,"4. An unmarried man should not keep school for the young because the mothers come to see their children. Nor should any woman keep school, because the fathers come to see them."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.2.5,"5. Twenty-five children may be put in charge of one teacher. If the number in the class exceeds twenty-five but is not more than forty, he should have an assistant to help with the instruction. If there are more than forty, two teachers must be appointed."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.2.6,"6. A child may be transferred from one teacher to another who is more competent in reading or grammar, only however, if both the teacher and the pupil live in the same town and are not separated by a river. But we must not take the child to school in another town nor even across a river in the same town, unless it is spanned by a firm bridge, not likely soon to collapse."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.2.7,"7. If one of the residents in an alley or even in a court wishes to open a school, his neighbours cannot prevent him. Nor can a teacher, already established, object to another teacher opening a school next door to him, either for new pupils or even with the intention of drawing away pupils from the existing school, for it is said, ""The Lord was pleased for His righteousness' sake, to make the Torah great and glorious"" (Is. 42:21)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.1,"1. With three crowns was Israel crowned — with the crown of the Torah, with the crown of the priesthood and with the crown of sovereignty. The crown of the priesthood was bestowed upon Aaron, as it is said, ""And it shall be unto him and unto his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood"" (Num. 25:13). The crown of sovereignty was conferred upon David, as it is said, ""His seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before Me"" (Ps. 89:37). The crown of the Torah however is for all Israel, as is it said, ""Moses commanded us a law, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob"" (Deut. 33:4). Whoever desires it can win it. Do not suppose that the other two crowns are greater than the crown of the Torah, for it is said, ""By me, kings reign and princes decree justice. By me, princes rule"" (Prov. 8:15-16). Hence the inference, that the crown of the Torah is greater than the other two crowns."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.2,"2. The sages said ""A bastard who is a scholar takes precedence of an ignorant High Priest; for it is said ""More precious it is than rubies"" (Prov. 3:15), that is (more to be honoured is the scholar) than the High Priest who enters the Innermost sanctuary.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* A play upon the word <i>Peninim</i> (rubies), taken as <i>Lifny v'lifnim</i> (High priest who entered the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement.).</i>"
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.3,"3. Of all precepts, none is equal in importance to the study of the Torah. Nay, study of the Torah is equal to them all, for study leads to practice. Hence, study always takes precedence of practice."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.4,"4. If the opportunity of fulfilling a specific precept would interrupt the study of the Torah and the precept can be performed by others, one should not intermit study. Otherwise, the precept should be performed and then the study be resumed."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.5,"5. At the Judgment hereafter, a man will first be called to account in regard to his fulfilment of the duty of study, and afterwards concerning his other activities. Hence, the sages said, ""A person should always occupy himself with the Torah, whether for its own sake or for other reasons. For study of the Torah, even when pursued from interested motives, will lead to study for its own sake."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.6,"6. He whose heart prompts him to fulfil this duty properly, and to be crowned with the crown of the Torah, must not allow his mind to be diverted to other objects. He must not aim at acquiring Torah as well as riches and honour at the same time. ""This is the way for the study of the Torah. A morsel of bread with salt thou must eat, and water by measure thou must drink; thou must sleep upon the ground and live a life of hardship, the while thou toilest in the Torah"" (Ethics of the Fathers 6:4). ""It is not incumbent upon thee to complete the task; but neither art thou free to neglect it"" (ibid 2:21). ""And if thou hast studied much Torah, thou hast earned much reward. The recompense will be proportionate to the pains"" (ibid 5:26).<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** The numbering of the paragraphs in the Ethics of the Fathers in the editions of the Mishna and in the editions of the liturgy does not always correspond.</i>"
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.7,"7. Possibly you may say: When I shall have accumulated money, I shall resume my studies; when I shall have provided for my needs and have leisure from my affairs, I shall resume my studies. Should such a thought enter your mind, you will never win the crown of the Torah. ""Rather make the study of the Torah your fixed occupation"" (ibid 1:15) and let your secular affairs engage you casually, and do not say: ""When I shall have leisure, I shall study; perhaps you may never have leisure"" (ibid 2:5)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.8,"8. In the Torah it is written, ""It is not in heaven…. neither is it beyond the sea"" (Deut. 30:12-13). ""It is not in heaven"", this means that the Torah is not to be found with the arrogant; ""nor beyond the seas"", that is, it is not found among those who cross the ocean. Hence, our sages said ""Nor can one who is engaged overmuch in business grow wise"" (Ethics of the Fathers 2:6). They have also exhorted us ""Engage little in business and occupy thyself with the Torah"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:12)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.9,"9. The words of the Torah have been compared to water, as it is said, ""O every one that thirsteth, come ye for water"" (Is. 55:1); this teaches us that just as water does not accumulate on a slope but flows away, while in a depression it stays, so the Words of the Torah are not to be found in the arrogant or haughty but only in him who is contrite and lowly in spirit, who sits in the dust at the feet of the wise and banishes from his heart lusts and temporal delights; works a little daily, just enough to provide for his needs, if he would otherwise have nothing to eat, and devotes the rest of the day and night to the study of the Torah."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.10,"10. One however who makes up his mind to study Torah and not work but live on charity, profanes the name of God, brings the Torah into contempt, extinguishes the light of religion, brings evil upon himself and deprives himself of life hereafter, for it is forbidden to derive any temporal advantage from the words of the Torah. The sages said ""Whoever derives a profit for himself from the words of the Torah is helping on his own destruction"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:17). They have further charged us ""Make not of them a crown wherewith to aggrandise thyself, nor a spade wherewith to dig"" (ibid 4:7). They likewise exhorted us ""Love work, hate lordship"" (ibid. 1:10). ""All study of the Torah, not conjoined with work, must, in the end, be futile, and become a cause of sin"" (ibid 2:2). The end of such a person will be that he will rob his fellow-creatures."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.11,"11. It indicates a high degree of excellence in a man to maintain himself by the labour of his hands. And this was the normal practice of the early saints. Thus, one secures all honour and happiness here and hereafter, as it is said ""When thou eatest of the labour of thine hands, happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee"" (Ps. 128:2). Happy shalt thou be in this world, and it shall be well with thee in the world to come, which is altogether good."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.12,"12. The words of the Torah do not abide with one who studies listlessly, nor with those who learn amidst luxury, and high living, but only with one who mortifies himself for the sake of the Torah, constantly enduring physical discomfort, and not permitting sleep to his eyes nor slumber to his eyelids. ""This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent"" (Num. 19:14). The sages explained the text metaphorically thus: ""The Torah only abides with him who mortifies himself in the tents of the wise."" And so Solomon, in his wisdom, said ""If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small indeed"" (Prov. 24:10). He also said ""Also my wisdom stood unto me"" (Eccles 2:9). This is explained by our wise men thus, ""The wisdom that I learnt in wrath,<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Play upon the word <i>aph</i> <span dir=""rtl"">אף</span>, meaning <i>also</i> and <i>wrath.</i></i>—this has remained with me."" The sages said ""There is a solemn covenant that anyone who toils at his studies in the Synagogue,<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** <span dir=""rtl"">בית הכנםת</span> Synagogue, where it was customary to study privately.</i> will not quickly forget."" He who toils privately in learning, will become wise, as it is said ""With the lowly (literally, <i>the reserved</i>) is wisdom"" (Prov. 11:2). If one recites aloud while studying, what he learns will remain with him. But he who reads silently soon forgets."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.13,"13. While it is a duty to study by day and by night, most of one's knowledge is acquired at night. Accordingly, when one aspires to win the crown of the Torah, he should be especially heedful of all his nights and not waste a single one of them in sleep, eating, drinking, idle talk and so forth, but devote all of them to study of the Torah and words of wisdom. The sages said ""That sound of the Torah has worth, which is heard by night, as it is said 'Arise, cry out in the night' (Lam. 2:19): and whoever occupies himself with the study of the Torah at night—a mark of spiritual grace distinguishes him by day, as it is said, 'By day the Lord will command His loving kindness, and in the night His song shall be with me, even a prayer unto the God of my life' (Ps. 42:9). A house wherein the words of the Torah are not heard at night will be consumed by fire, as it is said 'All darkness is laid up for his treasures; a fire not blown by man shall consume him"" (Job 20:26). 'Because he hath despised the word of the Lord' (Num. 15:31)—this refers to one who has utterly neglected (the study of) the words of the Torah."". And, so too, one who is able to occupy himself with the Torah and does not do so, or who had read Scripture and learnt <i>Mishnah</i> and gave them up for wordly inanities, and abandoned and completely renounced this study, is included in the condemnation, ""Because he hath despised the Word of the Lord"". The sages said, ""Whoever neglects the Torah because of wealth, will, at last be forced to neglect it owing to poverty. And whoever fulfills the Torah in poverty, will ultimately fulfill it amidst wealth"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:11, with order of sentences reversed). And this is explicitly set forth in the Torah, as it is said, ""Because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things, therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy"" (Deut. 28:47-48). It is also said ""That He might afflict thee…. to do thee good at thy latter end…."" (Deut. 8:16)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.1,"1. Torah should only be taught to a worthy pupil whose conduct is exemplary or whose disposition is simple. One however who walks in a way that is not good should first be reclaimed, trained in the right way and tested (as to his sincerity); then he is admitted into the <i>Beth Hamidrash</i> (College) and given instruction. The sages say: ""To teach a pupil who is unworthy is like casting a stone to Mercury (the idol), as it is said, ""As one puts a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool""<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* The stone does not stay long in the sling; it is soon shot out, so honour given to a fool does not stay long with him.</i> (Prov. 26:8). There is no honour but the Torah, as it is said, ""The wise shall inherit honour"" (Prov. 3:35). So too, if a teacher does not walk in the right way—even if he is a great scholar and all the people are in need of him—instruction is not to be received from him till he reforms; as it is said, ""For the priest's lips shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts"" (Mal. 2:7). Our sages applied this text thus: ""If the teacher is like an angel of the Lord of Hosts, they may seek the Law from his mouth. But if he is not, then they shall not seek the Law from his mouth."""
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.2,"2. How is instruction to be imparted ? The teacher is seated in the schoolroom facing the class, with the pupils around him like a crown, so that they can all see him and hear his words. The teacher is not to sit on a stool while his pupils are seated on the floor. Either all sit on the floor, or all on stools. Formerly the teacher used to be seated, while the pupils stood. But before the destruction of the Second Temple, it already had become the universal custom that pupils, while being taught, should be seated."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.3,"3. If it was his custom to teach the pupils personally, he may do so. If however, he taught through a <i>Meturgeman</i> (an interpreter), the latter stands between him and his pupils. The teacher addresses the interpreter, who declaims what he has just heard to all the pupils. And when they put questions to the interpreter, he asks the teacher. The teacher replies to the interpreter who addresses the answer to the one who put the question. The teacher should not raise his voice above the interpreter's voice. Nor should the latter raise his voice above that of the teacher, when he addresses a question to him. The interpreter may not detract aught from the teacher's words, nor add to them nor vary them—unless he is the teacher's father or instructor. In addressing the interpreter, the teacher uses the introductory formula: ""Thus my revered preceptor said to me"" or ""Thus my revered father said to me"". But when the interpreter repeats the words to the listener, he recites them in the name of the sage quoted, and mentions the name if he were the teacher's father or teacher, and says ""Thus said our Master so-and-so"" (naming him). He does so, even if the teacher abstained from naming the sage on the ground that it is forbidden to mention one's teacher or father by name."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.4,"4. If the teacher taught and his pupils did not understand, he should not be angry with them or fall into a rage, but should repeat the lesson again and again till they have grasped the full meaning of the Halacha (rule) he is expounding. So also, the pupil should not say ""I understand"" when he has not understood, but should ask again and again. And if the master is angry with him and storms at him, he should say ""Master, it is Torah. I need to learn, and my intellectual capacities are deficient."""
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.5,"5. A disciple should not feel ashamed before his fellow-students who grasp the lesson after hearing it once or twice, while he needs to hear it several times before he knows it. For if this makes him feel ashamed, he will go through college without having learnt anything. The ancient sages accordingly said, ""A bashful man cannot learn, nor a passionate man teach"" (Ethics of the Fathers 2:6). These observations only apply when the students' lack of understanding is due to the difficulty of the subject or to their mental deficiency. But if the teacher clearly sees that they are negligent and indolent in their study of the Torah and that this is the cause of their failure to understand, it is his duty to scold them and shame them with words of reproach, and so stimulate them to be keen. And in this regard, the sages said ""Arouse awe in the pupils"". It is thus improper for a teacher to indulge in frivolity before his pupils, or to jest in their presence, or eat and drink with them—so that the fear of him be upon them, and they will thus learn from him quickly."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.6,"6. Questions are not to be put to the teacher immediately on his entering the school, but only after his mind is composed. Nor should a pupil put a question as soon as he has come in, but only after he himself is composed and rested. Two pupils are not to put questions at one time. The teacher is not to be questioned on a topic not pertaining to the lesson, but only on the subject that is being treated, so as not to embarrass him. The teacher however should set ""pitfalls"" before his pupils, both in his questions and in what he does in their presence, in order to sharpen their wits, and ascertain whether they remember what he had taught them or do not remember it. Needless to add, that he has the right to question them on a subject other than that on which they are at the moment engaged, in order to stimulate them to be diligent in study."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.7,"7. No questions should be asked standing, nor answers given standing; nor should they be addressed by any one from an elevation, or from a distance, or when one is behind the elders. The teacher may only be questioned on the topic that is being studied. The questions are to be put in a respectful manner. One should not ask concerning more than three Halachoth (rules) in the topic."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.8,"8. Two individuals put questions. One of these questions is germane to the subject under discussion, while the other is not. Heed is given to the question that is germane. One question refers to a legal rule, the other to exegesis; the former receives attention. One question is exegetical; the other homiletical; the former is taken up. One question is homiletical <i>;</i> the other appertains to an inference a <i>fortiori;</i> the latter is answered. One question refers to an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, the other to an inference from similarity of phrases; the former is dealt with. Questions are put by two person, one of whom is a graduated scholar, the other a disciple; attention is paid to the scholar. One of them is a disciple, the other is unlettered; heed is given to the disciple. Where both are graduated scholars, disciples or unlettered, and the questions of both concern two legal rules, or two responses, or two practical issues, the interpreter may in these cases give the preference to either."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.9,"9. No one should sleep in the Beth Hamidrash (House of Study). If a student dozes there, his knowledge becomes a thing of shreds. Thus Solomon, in his wisdom, said, ""And drowsiness shall clothe one in rags"" (Prov. 23:21). No conversation may be held in the House of Study, except in reference to the words of the Torah. Even if one sneezes there, the others do not wish him 'good health'. Needless to add, other topics must not be discussed. The sanctity of a Beth Hamidrash is greater than that of synagogues."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.1,"1. Just as a person is commanded to honour and revere his father, so is he under an obligation to honour and revere his teacher, even to a greater extent than his father; for his father gave him life in this world, while his teacher who instructs him in wisdom, secures for him life in the world to come. If he sees an article that his father had lost and another article that his teacher had lost, the teacher's property should be recovered first, and then the father's. If his father and his teacher are loaded with burdens, he should first relieve his teacher and then his father. If his father and teacher are in captivity, he should first ransom his father. But, if his father is a scholar, even though not of the same rank as his teacher, he should first recover his father's lost property and then his teacher's. There is no honour higher than that which is due to the teacher; no reverence profounder than that which should be paid him. The sages said ""Reverence for thy teacher shall be like the fear of Heaven"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:15). They further said, ""Whoever distrusts the authority of his teacher—it is as if he disputes with the <i>Shechinah</i> !; as it is said, ""When they strove against the Lord"" (Num. 26:9). Whoever starts a quarrel with his teacher, it is as if he started a quarrel with the <i>Shechinah;</i> as it is said, ""Where the children of Israel strove with the Lord, and He was sanctified in them"" (Num. 20:13). And whoever cherishes resentment against his teacher—it is as if he cherishes resentment against the Lord, as it is said, ""Your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord"" (Ex. 16:8). Whoever harbours doubts about his teacher—it is as if he harbours doubts about the <i>Shechinah;</i> as it is said, ""And the people spoke against God and against Moses"" (Num. 21:3)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.2,"2. Who is to be regarded as disputing his teacher's authority ? One who sets up a college, holds sessions, discourses and instructs without his teacher's permission, during the latter's lifetime, and even if he be a resident in another country. To give decisions in his teacher's presence is forbidden at all times. Whoever gives a decision in his teacher's presence is deserving of death."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.3,"3. If there was a distance of twelve <i>mils</i><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* A <i>mil</i> (Hebrew mile) is 2,000 cubits.</i> between him and his teacher and a question was put to him concerning a rule of practice, he may give the answer; and, to save a man from doing what is forbidden, he may give a decision even in his teacher's presence. For instance, if he sees one committing a violation of the Law, because that person did not know that it is prohibited, or out of sheer wickedness, it is his duty to check the wrongdoer and say to him ""This is forbidden"". He should do so, even in the presence of his master, and even if the latter has not given him permission. For to save God's name from being profaned, we forego the honour due to the teacher. This however is only permitted casually. But to assume the function of a decisionist and give decisions regularly to all enquirers, even if he and his teacher live at opposite ends of the earth, is forbidden to a disciple, during his teacher's lifetime, unless he has his teacher's permission. Nor even after his teacher's death, may any disciple regularly give decisions, unless he has attained a standard of knowledge qualifying him to do so."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.4,"4. A disciple who is not thus qualified and nevertheless gives decisions is ""wicked, foolish and of an arrogant spirit"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:9). And of him it is said, ""For she hath cast down many wounded"" (Prov. 7:26). On the other hand, a sage, who is qualified and refrains from rendering decisions, withholds knowledge of the Torah and puts stumbling blocks before the blind. Of him it is said ""Even the mighty are all her slain"" (Prov. 7:26). The students of small minds who have acquired an insufficient knowledge of the Torah, and yet seek to aggrandise themselves before the ignorant and among their townsmen by impertinently putting themselves forward and presuming to judge and render decisions in Israel—these are the ones who multiply strife, devastate the world, quench the light of the Torah and spoil the vineyard of the Lord of hosts. Of such, Solomon, in his wisdom, said ""Seize for us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vineyard"" (Song of Songs 2:15)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.5,"5. A disciple is forbidden to call his teacher by his name, even when the latter is not present. This rule only applies if the name is unusual, so that any one hearing it knows who is meant. In his presence, the pupil must never mention his teacher's name, even if he desires to call another person who bears the same name; the same is the rule with his father's name. In referring to them even after their death, he should use a descriptive title, (""my honoured father"", or ""my honoured teacher""). A disciple may not greet his teacher or return his greeting in the same manner as people are wont to greet their companions and return their greetings. But he should bow to his teacher and address him with reverence and deference ""Peace be unto thee, my teacher"". If the teacher greeted him first, he should respond ""Peace to thee, my teacher and master""."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.6,"6. So too, he should not remove his phylacteries in his teacher's presence, nor recline in his presence, but should sit respectfully, as one sits before a king. He should not recite his prayers, while standing in front of his teacher, or behind him, or at his side; needless to add, that he must not step (backward or forward) side by side with the teacher, but should stand at a distance in the rear, not however, exactly behind his teacher, and then he can offer up his devotions. He must not go with his teacher into the same bath room. He must not sit in his teacher's seat. When his teacher and a colleague dispute with one another, he must not, in his teacher's presence, interpose his opinion as to who is right. He must not contradict his teacher's statements. He may not sit down in his teacher's presence, till he is told ""be seated"", nor stand up, till he is told to stand up, or till he obtains permission to stand up. And when he quits, he must not turn his back, but should retire with his face to his teacher."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.7,"7. It is his duty to rise before his teacher, from the moment he sees him at a distance, (and keep standing) till he disappears from view and is no longer visible; then the disciple may resume his seat. It is a person's duty to visit his teacher on the festivals."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.8,"8. Courtesy must not be shown to a pupil in the teacher's presence, unless the teacher himself is wont to show courtesy to that pupil. The various offices that a slave performs for his master, a pupil performs for his teacher. If however he is in a place where he is unknown, and has no phylacteries with him<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Only worn by free Israelites.</i>, and fears that people will say that he is a slave, he does not help his teacher to put on or remove his shoes. Whoever refuses his pupil's services, withholds kindness from him and removes from him the fear of Heaven<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** Suggested by the exhortation in the Ethics of the Fathers ""Let reverence for thy teacher be as the fear of Heaven"".</i>. A pupil who neglects any of the courtesies due to his master causes the <i>Schechinah</i> to depart from Israel."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.9,"9. If a pupil saw his teacher violating the ordinances of the Torah, he should say to him, ""Our master, thus and thus, hast thou taught us"". Whenever a pupil recites a dictum in his teacher's presence, he should say ""Thus, our master, hast thou taught us"". He should never quote a dictum that he has not heard from his teacher, without giving the authority for it. When his teacher dies, he rends all the garments he wears till he bares his breast. These rents he nver sews up. These rules only apply to the chief teacher from whom one has learnt most of what he knows. But his relation to one from whom he did not acquire most of his knowledge is that of a junior to a senior fellow-student. Towards such a senior student (who was at the same time his teacher), the disciple is not required to observe all the above-mentioned points of courtesy. But the junior has to stand up before him, and, on his demise, has to rend his garments, just as he does for a deceased relative for whom he mourns. Even if one learnt from a person one thing only, be it great or small, one has to stand up before that person and rend one's garments at his demise."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.10,"10. No scholar who possesses good manners will speak before his superior in knowledge, even if he has learnt nothing from him."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.11,"11. If one's chief teacher desires to excuse all his pupils or any one of them from all or any of these observances, he may do so. But even then, the disciple must show courtesy to him, even at the moment when he explicitly dispenses with it."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.12,"12. As pupils are bound to honour their teacher, so a teacher ought to show courtesy and friendliness to his pupils. The sages said ""Let the honour of thy disciples be as dear to thee as thine own"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:15). A man should take an interest in his pupils and love them, for they are his spiritual children who will bring him happiness in this world and in the world hereafter."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.13,"13. Disciples increase the teacher's wisdom and broaden his mind. The sages said, ""Much wisdom I learnt from my teachers, more from my colleagues; from my pupils, most of all"". Even as a small piece of wood kindles a large log, so a pupil of small attainments sharpens the mind of his teacher, so that by his questions, he elicits glorious wisdom."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.1,"1. It is a duty to honour every scholar, even if he is not one's teacher, as it is said, ""Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man"" (Lev. 19.32). The word <i>Zaken</i> (rendered ""old man"" refers to one who has acquired wisdom. When ought people to rise up before him ? At the moment that he has approached within four cubits, (and they should keep standing) till he has passed out of sight."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.2,"2. This courtesy is not to be observed in a bath-house nor in a latrine, for it is said, ""Thou shalt rise up and <i>honour</i>"" (Lev. 19:32); the courtesy of rising must be such as to express honour. Labourers, at the time when they are working, need not rise up before scholars, as it is said ""Thou shalt rise up and honour""; even as the ""honouring"" enjoined does not involve a monetary loss, so the courtesy of rising before the scholar is only required when it does not involve a monetary loss. And whence do we know that one should not shut one's eyes when a scholar passes, so as not to see him and thus evade the obligation of standing up before him ? It is inferred from the text ""And thou shalt fear thy God"" (Lev. 19:32); wherever the fulfilment of a duty is left to the conscience, the exhortation is added ""Thou shalt fear thy God""."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.3,"3. It is improper for a sage to put the people to inconvenience by deliberately passing before them, so that they should have to stand up before him. He should use a short route and endeavour to avoid notice so that they should not be troubled to stand up. The sages were wont to use circuitous and exterior paths, where they were not likely to meet those who might recognise them, so as not to trouble them."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.4,"4. The same rule applies to riding as to walking. As it is a duty to rise up before the sage when he walks, so this courtesy should be shown when he rides by."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.5,"5. Where three are walking on a road, the teacher should be in the middle, the senior (of his disciples) at his right, the junior on his left."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.6,"6. On seeing a <i>Chacham</i> (a sage or religious authority), one does not rise till he has approached within four cubits; and as soon as he has passed, one resumes one's seat. On seeing the <i>Ab-beth-Din</i> (head of a Court; in ancient times, Vice-President of the Great Synhedrion), one stands up as soon as he comes within sight, and does not sit down till he has passed on to a distance of four cubits beyond the observer. On seeing the <i>Nasi,</i> (the Patriarch of Palestine, in ancient times, President of the Great Synhedrion), one rises as soon as he is seen, and does not sit down till he is seated in his place or has passed out of sight. If the <i>Nasi</i> desires to dispense with the courtesy due to him, he may do so. When the <i>Nasi</i> enters an assembly, all present rise and do not sit down till he says to them ""sit"". When the <i>Ab-beth-Din</i> enters, two rows are formed. Those forming these rows on either side stand up while he passes between them till he is seated in his place. The rest of the people remain seated in their places."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.7,"7. When a <i>Chacham</i> enters, each person stands up as he approaches him within four cubits, and then resumes his seat, and so does the next one till the <i>Chacham</i> has reached his place and is seated. Sons of sages and their disciples, when the public requires their services, make their way over the heads of the people, to reach their places. It is however not praiseworthy for the disciples of the sages to be the last to enter. If one needs to withdraw (from the room)—when he returns, he goes back to his place. Young children, of sages who have enough intelligence to follow the discourse, face their father (when he is lecturing). If they are too young to understand, they face the people."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.8,"8. A pupil, in regular attendance, may only rise before his teacher in the morning and in the evening, so that the honour paid to the teacher shall not be more than that shown to God."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.9,"9. One rises up before an old man, advanced in years, even if he is not a sage. Even a learned man who is young rises up before an old man of advanced age. He is not obliged however to rise to his full height but need only raise himself sufficiently to indicate courtesy. Even a gentile who is aged should be shown courtesy in speech; and one should extend a hand to support him, as it is said, ""Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head"", without qualification."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.10,"10. Scholars do not go out to take part with the rest of the community in building, digging or similar work for the state, so as not to lose the respect of the common people. Nor are they assessed for the cost of building the walls, repairing the gates, paying the watchmen's wages, etc., or making a gift to the king. Nor are they obliged to pay a tax, jointly or severally levied upon the inhabitants of a city, as it is said, ""Yea, though they hire<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Joseph Caro in his <i>Keseph Mishnah,</i> explains this verse thus ""If they all study Torah (play upon <i>Yitnu,</i> which means in Aramaic, <i>they study</i>.), God will gather them; if only a few do so, they will be diminished"".</i> among the nations, now will I gather them up, and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of kings and princes"" (Hos. 8:10). So too, if a scholar has goods for sale, he is to be given the opportunity of disposing of them first; and no one else in the market is to be permitted to sell, till the scholar has first sold his stock. Similarly, if he has a cause pending and he is standing among a large number of suitors, his cause is taken first, and (during the hearing) he is seated."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.11,"11. It is exceedingly iniquitous to contemn sages or hate them. Jerusalem was only destroyed when its scholars were treated with contumely, as it is said ""But they mocked the messengers of God and despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets"" (II Chron. 36; 16); this means that they ""despised those who taught His words"". So too, the text ""And if ye shall abhor My statutes (Lev. 26:15) means ""if ye abhor the teachers of My statutes"". Whoever contemns the sages will have no portion in the world to come, and is included in the censure ""For the word of the Lord hath he despised"" (Num. 15:31)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.12,"12. Although one who contemns the sages forfeits his portion in the world to come, yet if witnesses came forward and testified that a certain individual reviled a sage, even if only in words, the offender has incurred the penalty of excommunication. The Court (if he is found guilty) publicly excommunicates him and also imposes upon him a fine of one <i>litra</i><sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** <i>Litra</i> in gold = 25 gold denarii.</i> in gold, a penalty of uniform amount in all places, and this is given to the sage. Whoever reviles a <i>Chacham</i> in words, even after the latter's decease, is excommunicated by the Court, which lifts the ban after he repents. If the sage who has been reviled is living, the offender is only released with the concurrence of the person on whose account the ban had been imposed. To safeguard his honour, the <i>Chacham</i> may himself excommunicate a boor who treated him disrespectfully. For this, neither witnesses nor a previous warning are necessary. The ban is not removed till the offender has appeased the <i>Chacham.</i> If he died before this was done, three men constitute themselves a quorum and remove the ban. If the <i>Chacham</i> desires to forgive the offender, and does not excommunicate him, he is at liberty to do so."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.13,"13. When a teacher, to safeguard the honour due to him, excommunicated any person, it is the duty of all his disciples to treat that person as under the ban. But when a disciple excommunicated anyone, for his own honour's sake, the teacher is not bound to respect the ban, but the people must do so. Similarly, anyone whom the <i>Nasi</i> (Patriarch of Palestine) excommunicated is to be treated by all Israel as under the ban. But if all Israel excommunicated a person, the <i>Nasi</i> need not treat him as excommunicated. Whoever has been placed under a ban of excommunication in his own city, is to be so regarded in another city. But one, who has been placed under such a ban in another city than his own, is not under a ban in his own city."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.14,"14. The foregoing rules only apply to one who was excommunicated because he reviled scholars. But if one was excommunicated for other transgressions, the penalty for which is excommunication, even if the ban was pronounced by the humblest individual in Israel, the <i>Nasi</i> and all Israel are bound to respect it till the offender repents of the transgression for which he had been excommunicated and is released from the ban. There are twenty-four offences for which the ban is pronounced on an individual, irrespective of sex. The category is as follows:"
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.15,"1) Whoever reviles a <i>Chacham,</i> even after his decease; 2) Insults the messenger of a Court; 3) calls another person, a slave; 4) receives a citation from a Court to appear at its sessions, on a date fixed by the Court, and fails to attend; 5) slights any ordinance instituted by the Scribes, or, needless to add, any precept of the Torah; 6) whoever refuses to accept the decision of a Court, is placed under the ban of excommunication till judgment is satisfied; 7) whoever keeps on his premises anything noxious, such as a vicious dog or an unsafe ladder, is put under a ban till he removes the nuisance; 8) whoever sells any of his real property to an idolater, is excommunicated till he assumes liability for all injuries that may accrue from the idolater to his Israelite neighbour who owns adjacent property; 9) whoever testifies concerning an Israelite before the idolaters' courts and the effect of his testimony is to force the Israelite to make a payment for which, he would not, according to Jewish Law, have been liable, is placed under a ban till he makes restitution; 10) a butcher, who is a <i>Cohen</i> (priest descended in the male line of Aaron), and who does not separate the portions of a slaughtered beast due to the priest and give them to another priest, is placed under a ban till he does so; 11) whoever violates the sanctity of the second days of the Festivals, notwithstanding that the observance of these days is due to custom; 12) whoever does manual labour on the Eve of Passover, after midday; 13) takes God's name in vain; or takes it with an oath, in matters of no importance; 14) causes the public to profane God's name; 15) causes the public to eat sacrifices outside the prescribed bounds; 16) calculates, outside of Palestine, the annual calendar, and appoints dates for the beginning of the month; 17) causes the blind to stumble; 18) keeps the public from fulfilling a religious duty; 19) a slaughterer who permits forbidden meat to leave his premises as fit for Jewish consumption; 20) or who has not examined his slaughtering knife in the presence of the <i>Chacham</i> (religious head of the community); 21) whoever deliberately practises priapism; 22) whoever divorces his wife and then enters into a partnership with her, or engages in other commercial transactions which bring them into close relations—when they come into Court (i.e. when they come under the notice of the Court) they are placed under a ban; 23) a religious leader of evil repute; 24) whoever unjustly excommunicates one who has not incurred the ban."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.1,"1. If a sage grown old in wisdom, a <i>Nasi,</i> or <i>Ab-beth-Din,</i> committed a grave offence, he is, under no circumstances, to be publicly excommunicated, unless he acted like Jeroboam, the son of Nebat and his confederates. But if he committed other sins less heinous, he is punished with stripes privately, as it is said ""Therefore shalt thou stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night"" (Hosea 4:5); this means that even if he stumbled, conceal it as in the darkness of the night. And we also say to him ""Save your self-respect and stay at home"" (II Kings 14:6). So too, if any scholar rendered himself liable to excommunication, the Court is forbidden to act precipitately and hastily put him under the ban. The members of the Court should flee from such a procedure, and take no part in it. The saints among the sages gloried in the fact that they never sat in a quorum of judges, to excommunicate a scholar, though they might sit as judges in a court that sentenced a scholar to be punished with stripes, if he had incurred that penalty, and even if the sentence was for contumacy."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.2,"2. What is the form used for <i>Niddui</i> (the lighter ban of excommunication)? (The authority who excommunicates) says ""So-and-so (naming him) shall be under a ban"". If the excommunication took place in the offender's presence, he says to him ""This person, (naming him) is under a ban. For <i>Cherem</i> (the severer excommunication), he says to him ""So-and-so (naming him) is under <i>Cherem</i> and accursed; he is under an imprecation with Oath and Ban""."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.3,"3. How is the lighter or severer excommunication removed ? The authority says to the person excommunicated ""Thou art released; thou art forgiven"". If the person is released in his absence, the formula is ""So-and-so (naming him) is released and forgiven""."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.4,"4. How should a person under the milder ban conduct himself, and how should others conduct themselves towards him ? During the whole of the term for which he has been excommunicated, he is, like a mourner, forbidden to have his hair cut or to bathe. He is not counted in the quorum of three or ten, required for reciting the special introduction to the Grace after Meals. He is not included in the congregation of ten men for any function that requires that number. No one may sit down within four cubits of where he is. He may however teach and be taught. He may be hired and hire others. If he dies, while under the ban, the Court orders a stone to be put on his coffin, as much as to say that he is stoned because he is separated from the community. Needless to state that no funeral eulogy is delivered, and his bier is not followed."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.5,"5. One who is in <i>Cherem</i> (under the severer ban of excommunication) suffers the additional severities that he may neither instruct nor receive instruction, but he studies privately, so as not to forget what he had learnt. He may neither be hired nor may he hire others. No one engages in commercial transactions with him, except to a slight extent, as much as is sufficient to provide him with a livelihood."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.6,"6. If a person has been for thirty days under <i>Niddui</i> (the milder ban) and made no request to be released, the ban is imposed for a second term of thirty days. If this period also passed without his seeking to have the ban removed, he is placed under the severer ban."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.7,"7. How many persons are needed to remove the milder or severer ban ? Three, even if they are private individuals. A qualified scholar can by himself remove the lighter or graver ban. A disciple has the right to do so, even in the locality where his teacher resides."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.8,"8. If three persons pronounced a ban of excommunication and left the place, and the offender renounced the practice for which he had been excommunicated, three others may proceed to release him."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.9,"9. If one does not know who it was that imposed the ban upon him, he should go to the <i>Nasi</i> and he will release him from the ban."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.10,"10. A ban that is conditional, even if self-imposed, requires annulment. A scholar who excommunicated himself, may himself annul the ban, even when he had added to it the clause, ""According to the view of So-and-so"", and even though the excommunication was for a transgression for which he had incurred that penalty."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.11,"11. A man who dreamt that he had been excommunicated, even if he knows who it was that had (in his dream) excommunicated him, requires ten men who study <i>Halachoth</i> (legal rules) to release him from the ban. If he does not find them, he must go as far as a <i>Parsah</i> (four <i>mils</i>) to seek them. If he fails to find ten men with these qualifications, ten men who study <i>Mishna</i> may release him. Failing these, he may be released by ten who can read Scripture. If such are not accessible, he may be released by ten men even if they are unable to read Scripture. If he cannot find ten men in his locality, three individuals may release him."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.12,"12. If the ban was imposed on a person in his presence, it can only be removed in his presence. If it was imposed in his absence, it may be removed in his presence or absence. No interval of time need elapse between the imposition of a ban and its annulment, but the pronouncement of a ban may be immediately followed by its removal if the individual under the ban reforms. The Court may, at its discretion, leave a man under the ban for many years, according to the extent of his wickedness. If the Court see fit straightway to impose upon a person the <i>Cherem</i> (severer ban), and the same ban on any one who eats or drinks with him or stays near him within the distance of four cubits, they may do so in order to punish the offender and build a fence round the Torah, so that sinners shall not break bounds. Although a  <i>Chacham</i> has the right to pronounce the ban to safeguard his honour, it is not creditable for a scholar to accustom himself to this procedure. He should rather close his ears to remarks of the illiterate and take no notice of them, as Solomon, in his wisdom, said ""Also pay not heed to all the words that are spoken"" (Eccles. 7:21). Such too, was the way of the ancient saints. They heard themselves reviled and made no reply. Yet more, they forgave the reviler and pardoned him. Great sages, glorying in their commendable practices, said that they never, for the sake of personal honour, imposed on any one the lighter or severer ban. This is the way of scholars, which it is right to follow. It however only applies to cases where one has been reviled in private. But a scholar, who has been treated with contumely or been reviled in public, may not forgive the wrong done to his honour. If he does so, he is punished, for this is contempt of the Torah. We should relentlessly pursue the matter, till the offender begs his pardon, after which he should be forgiven."

"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.1.1","1.<sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">*** The Roman numerals in the following chapters correspond to the Hebrew numerals at the beginning of the paragraphs in the manuscript which do not follow the same division as in the printed editions. The first paragraph in each of the following chapters is not marked by a numeral in the manuscript. The Arabic numerals correspond to those in the printed editions.</i> With regard to all the precepts of the Torah, affirmative or negative, if a person transgressed any one of them, either wilfully or in error, and repents and turns away from his sin, he is under a duty to confess before God, blessed be He, as it is said, ""When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the Lord, and that person be guilty, then they shall confess their sin which they have done"" (Num. 5:6-7); this means <i>confess in words</i>; and this confession is an affirmative precept.<sup>****</sup><i class=""footnote"">**** There is no numeral (<span dir=""rtl"">ב</span>) there in the Hebrew Manuscript; the new paragraph is indicated by an empty space.</i> How does one confess ? The penitent says ""I beseech thee, O Lord, I have sinned, I have acted perversely; I have transgressed before Thee, and have done thus and thus, and lo, I repent and am ashamed of my deeds, and I will never do this again"". This constitutes the essence of Confession. The fuller and more detailed the confession one makes, the more praiseworthy is he. III. And so, those who were under an obligation to bring sin-offerings and trespass-offerings, when they bring their sacrifices for sins committed in error or wilfully, are not forgiven through those offerings, till they have repented and made confession in words, as it is said, ""….he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned"" (Lev. 5:5). IV. So too, those who incurred the judicial penalty of death or punishment of stripes, do not obtain forgiveness by suffering death or receiving stripes unless they repent and confess. Similarly, one who inflicted a wound on another person, or caused him monetary damage, even though he pays what is due to the injured party, does not obtain pardon till he confesses and penitently resolves never to commit the same offence again, as it is said, ""(when a man or woman) shall commit any sin that men commit …. then they shall confess"" (Num. 5:6-7)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.1.2","2. V. Since the scapegoat, was an atonement for all Israel, the High Priest made confession over it in the name of all Israel, as it is said ""and he shall confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel"" (Lev. 16:21). VI. The scapegoat atoned for all transgressions mentioned in the Torah, both light and grave, whether committed presumptuously or in error, whether the offender became aware of his transgression, or did not become aware of it; for all sins the scapegoat atoned, provided that the offender repented. But if he did not repent, then the scapegoat only secures forgiveness for the light transgressions. VII. Which are the light, and which the grave transgressions ? The grave transgressions are those which make the offender liable to a judicial sentence of death or to excision. Likewise, oaths taken in vain or to support a falsehood, though not involving the penalty of excision, are classed among the grave transgressions. Violations of other prohibitions and of affirmative precepts, the neglect of which is not punished by excision, constitute the light transgressions."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.1.3","3. VIII. At the present time, when the Temple no longer exists, and we have no altar for atonement, nothing is left but repentance. Repentance atones for all transgressions. Even if a man was wicked all the days of his life and repented at the end, nothing of his wickedness is recalled to him, as it is said ""And as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not stumble thereby in the day that he turns from his wickedness"" (Ezek. 33:12). The Day of Atonement itself atones for the penitent, as it is said, ""For on this day, shall atonement be made for you"" (Lev. 16:30)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.1.4","4. IX. Although Repentance atones for all offences and the Day of Atonement serves as atonement, still there are some transgressions that are forgiven immediately, while others are pardoned only after a time. For example, if a person transgressed an affirmative precept, the neglect of which is not punished by excision, and repented, he is forgiven straightway. Of those who commit this class of offences, it is said, ""Return ye backsliding children, I will heal your backsliding"" (Jerem. 3:22). X. A person violated a prohibition, the penalty for which is neither excision nor a judicial sentence of death and repented, the repentance stays the punishment and the Day of Atonement secures pardon. Of this class of offences, it is said, ""For on this day shall atonement be made for you"" (Lev. 15:30). XI. A person committed transgressions for which the penalty is excision or a judicial sentence of death, and repented; repentance together with the Day of Atonement stay the punishment, and afflictions that come upon him complete the expiation; and indeed, till he has suffered afflictions, the expiation is not completed. Of this class of offence, it is said, ""Then will I visit their transgressions with the rod and their iniquity with strokes"" (Ps. 89:33). XII. This is only so if, at the time when he transgressed, he had not profaned the Name of God. But if one profanes God's Name, even though he repents, even though the Day of Atonement comes and he is still penitent, even if he suffers afflictions, his atonement is not completed till he dies. Repentance, the Day of Atonement and afflictions—all of them together—serve to stay punishment, and death secures forgiveness, as it is said, ""And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of Hosts, surely this iniquity shall not be expiated by you till ye die"" (Is. 22:14)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.1","1. What is perfect repentance ? It is so when an opportunity presents itself for repeating an offence once committed, and the offender, while able to commit the offence, nevertheless refrains from doing so, because he is penitent and not out of fear or failure of vigour. For instance, if a man had sinful intercourse with a woman, and after a time was alone with her, his passion for her persisting, his physical powers unabated while he continued to live in the same district where he had sinned, and yet he refrains and does not transgress, he is a sincere penitent. And so Solomon said, ""Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say 'I have no pleasure in them'"" (Eccles. 12:1). II. If however, a person only repented in old age, at a time when he is no longer capable of doing what he had done—although this is not an excellent mode of repentance, it nevertheless avails him and he is accepted as a penitent. Even if one transgressed all his life and only repented on the day of his death and dies penitent, all his iniquities are pardoned to him, as it is said ""Before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain"" (Eccles. 12:2)—which is an allusion to the day of death. Hence the inference that if one remembers his Creator and repents before death, he is forgiven."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.2","2. III. What is Repentance ? It consists in this, that the sinner abandon his sin, remove it from his thoughts, and resolve in his heart never to repeat it, as it is said, ""let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts"" (Is. 55:7); that he regret the past, as it is said, ""Surely, after that I turned I repented, after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh"" (Jer. 31:19); that he calls Him who knows all secrets to witness that he will never return to this sin again, as it is said, ""neither will we call any more the work of our hands our God, for in Thee the fatherless findeth mercy"" (Hos. 14:4). It is also necessary that he make oral confession and utter the resolutions which he made in his heart."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.3","3. IV. He who confesses in words and has not in his heart resolved to forsake his sin is like one who baptizes himself and keeps in his hand a creeping thing. Unless he casts it away, his baptism is useless. And thus it is said, ""but whoso confesseth and forsaketh (them) shall obtain mercy"" (Prov. 28:13). Moreover it is necessary to specify the sin, as it is said, ""O, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them a god of gold"" (Ex. 32:31)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.4","4. V. Some of the modes of manifesting repentance are that the penitent cries continuously before the Lord with tears and supplications; gives charity according to his means; keeps far away from that wherein he sinned; changes his name, as much as to say: ""I am another individual and not the one who committed those deeds""; changes all his activities for a better course, for the righeous way; and exiles himself from his former place of residence, since exile atones for iniquity, inducing, as it does, humility, meekeness and lowliness of spirit."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.5","5. VI. It is highly praiseworthy in a penitent to make public confession, openly avow his transgressions and discover to others his sins against his fellow-men; he should say to them: ""Truly, I have sinned against so and so, and did thus and thus to him; and 10, this day, I repent and feel remorse"". He, however, who is proud and does not publish his trespasses but conceals them, has not achieved complete repentance, as it is said, ""He who covereth his transgressions shall not prosper"" (Prov. 28:13). VII. This only applies to transgressions in matters between man and man. But sins committed against God, the penitent need not publish. Indeed, it is a mark of effrontery on his part if he does so, but he should repent of them before the Almighty, blessed be He, declaring in detail his sins before Him, and make public confession in general terms; and it is well for him that his iniquity has not become known, as it is said, ""Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered"" (Ps. 32:1)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.6","6. VIII. Although repentance and supplication are always good, they are particularly so and are immediately accepted during the ten days intervening between the New Year and the Day of Atonement, as it is said, ""Seek the Lord while He may be found"" (Is. 55:6). This only applies, however, to an individual. But as for a community, whenever its members repent and offer supplications with sincere hearts, they are answered, as it is said, ""For what great nation is there that hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord, our God, whensoever we call to Him"" (Deut. 4:7)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.7","7. IX. The Day of Atonement is the time of repentance for all, for the individual as well as for the multitude. It is the goal of the penitential season, appointed unto Israel for pardon and forgiveness. Hence, all are under the obligation of repenting and making confession on the Day of Atonement. The duty of confession, on the Day of Atonement, requires that a person should begin to make his confession already on the previous day, before he takes his meal, lest he choke (while he is eating) without having confessed. And notwithstanding that he had already made confession, he confesses again on the night of the Day of Atonement, during the evening service, and again in the morning service, additional, afternoon and concluding services. At which part of the service is the confession made ? It is recited by the individual after the <i>Amidah;</i> by the reader of the congregation, during the <i>Amidah</i>, in its fourth blessing."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.8","8. X. The formula of confession adopted by all Israel is the sentence ""Verily we have sinned"". This is the essence of the confession. Transgressions, confessed on one Day of Atonement, are again confessed on the next Day of Atonement, even if one has continued penitent, as it is said, ""For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me"" (Ps. 51:5)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.9","9. XI. Repentance and the Day of Atonement only secure forgiveness for transgressions against God; as, for example, when one has partaken of forbidden food or indulged in illicit intercourse, and so forth. But transgressions against one's fellow-men, as for instance, if one wounds, curses or robs his neighbour or commits similar wrongs, are never pardoned till the injured party has received the compensation due to him and has also been appeased. XII. Even though he has made the compensation, the wrongdoer must also appease the one he has injured and ask his forgiveness. Even if a person only annoyed another in words, he has to pacify the latter and entreat him till he has obtained his forgiveness. XIII. If however, the injured party is unwilling to forgive, he should bring three of his friends at one time, and they should entreat the person offended, and solicit his pardon. If they fail, he should take with him a second and even a third group. If the offended person continues obdurate, he leaves him alone and goes away. The one who refused to forgive is now the sinner. But if the offended person was the offender's teacher, the pupil has to go to him again and again, even a thousand times, till pardon has been granted."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.10","10. XIV. It is forbidden to be obdurate and not allow oneself to be appeased. On the contrary one should be easily pacified and find it difficult to become angry. And, when asked by an offender for forgiveness, one should forgive with a sincere mind and willing spirit. Even if one had been much vexed and grievously wronged, he is not to avenge nor bear a grudge. Forgiveness is natural to the seed of Israel, characteristic of their upright heart. Not so are the hard-hearted heathens. ""His resentment keeps for ever"" (Amos 1:11). Thus, of the Gibeonites who did not forgive and refused to be appeased, it is said, ""Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel"" (II Sam. 21:2)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.11","11. XV. If a person sinned against another and the latter died before pardon was sought, the sinner should bring ten men, station them at the grave of the deceased, and, in their presence, make the declaration: ""I sinned against the Lord, God of Israel and against this individual, having committed such and such a wrong against him"". If he owed the deceased money, he should pay it to the heirs. If he did not know of any heirs, he should deposit the amount in Court, and make confession."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.1","1. Every human being has merits and iniquities. One whose merits exceed his iniquities is righteous. He whose iniquities exceed his merits is wicked. If the two balance in an individual, he belongs to the intermediate class. II. So it is with a country. If the merits of all its inhabitants exceed their iniquities, the country is righteous. If their iniquities preponderate, it is a wicked country. So too is it with regard to the whole of the world."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.2","2. III. A person whose iniquities exceed his merits perishes forthwith in his wickedness, as it is said, ""For the multitude of thy iniquity"" (Hosea. 9:7). So too, a country, the iniquities of whose inhabitants preponderate, perishes forthwith, as it is said, ""the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah, because it is great"" (Gen. 18:20). So, with the entire world, if the iniquities of its human population exceed their merits, they are destroyed forthwith, as it is said, ""And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth"" (Gen. 6:5). IV. This valuation takes into account not the number but the magnitude of merits and iniquities. There may be a single merit that outweighs many iniquities, as it is said, ""Because in him there is found some good thing"" (I. Kings 14:13). And there may be one iniquity that counterbalances many merits, as it is said ""But one sinner<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* In the sense of <i>one sin.</i> <span dir=""rtl"">חֵטא</span></i> destroyeth much good"" (Eccles. 9:19). The valuation is according to the knowledge of the Omniscient God. He alone knows how to set off merit against iniquities."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.3","3. V. Whoever regrets the precepts that he had fulfilled and wonders at his meritorious deeds, saying to himself, 'What profit have I of them ? Would that I had not done them', forfeits the credit for all of them, and none of his meritorious deeds is ever remembered in his favour, as it is said„ ""The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him on the day of his transgression"" (Ezek. 33:12); that is, if he regrets his former good deeds. VI. And even as a man's meritorious deeds and iniquities are balanced at the hour of death, so are the iniquities of every single inhabitant of the Earth weighed against his merits annually on the New Year Feast. He who is found righteous is sealed unto life; he who is found wicked is sealed unto death. If one belongs to the intermediate class, sentence on him is suspended till the Day of Atonement. If he repents, he is sealed unto life; if he does not do so, he is sealed unto death."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.4","4. VII. Although the Sounding of the Shofar on the New Year is a decree of Holy Writ<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* To be obeyed without question as to its purpose.</i>, still it has a deep meaning, as if saying, ""Awake, awake, O sleepers, from your sleep; O slumberers, arouse ye from your slumbers; and examine your deeds, return in repentance, and remember your Creator. Those of you who forget the truth in the follies of the times and go astray, the whole year, in vanity and emptiness, which neither profit nor save, look to your souls; improve your ways and works. Abandon, everyone of you, his evil course and the thought that is not good"". VIII. It is necessary therefore that every one, throughout the year, should regard himself as if he were half innocent and half guilty; and should regard the whole of mankind as half innocent and half guilty. If then he commits one more sin, he presses down the scale of guilt against himself and the whole world and causes his destruction. If he fulfills one commandment, he turns the scale of merit in his favour and in that of the whole world, and brings salvation and deliverance to all his fellow-creatures and to himself, as it is said, ""the righteous man is the foundation of the world"" (Prov. 10:25); that is to say, that he who acts justly presses down the scale of merit in favour of all the world and saves it. IX. And because of these considerations, the whole house of Israel have the custom to increase their charities and other good deeds from the New Year to the Day of Atonement and engage in religious duties at this period to a larger extent than during the rest of the year. So too, during these ten days, all rise up while it is still night, and pray in the synagogues till dawn, with fervent entreaties and supplications."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.5","5. X. When a person's iniquities and merits are weighed, the first offence that he committed is not counted, nor yet the second. The reckoning starts from the third offence. And if his iniquities, from the third onwards, are found to exceed his merits, the first two sins are also included in the demerits and he is judged for all of them. XI. But if his merits and iniquities—counting from the third offence—are found to balance, then all his iniquities are cancelled, one after another. The third is regarded as if it had been the first, the first two having already been forgiven. Then the fourth is regarded as if it had been the first, the third having been forgiven; and so on to the last. XII. This applies to an individual, as it is said, ""Lo, all these things does God do; twice, yea, thrice with a man"" (Job. 33:29). As to a community, (punishment for) their first offence as will as for their second and third, is suspended, as it is said ""For three transgressions of Israel,—yea, for four, I will not reverse it"" (Amos. 2:6). When account is taken of the merits and demerits of a community, their sins are reckoned from the fourth onwards, after the manner already described. XIII. As to those who belong to the intermediate class, if among half of an individual's deeds which constitute offences there is included the sin of never having put on phylacteries,<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Wilfully and in a spirit of contempt.</i> he is judged according to his sins but will have a portion in the world to come. So too, all wicked persons whose iniquities exceed their merits are judged according to their sins and have a portion in the world to come; for all Israelites, notwithstanding that they have sinned, have a portion in the life hereafter, as it is said, ""Thy people shall all be righteous, they shall inherit the land for ever"" (Isaiah. 60:21). The expression <i>land</i> is a metaphor for the land of life, that is, the world to come. And so too, the saints among the gentile peoples have a portion in the world to come."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.6","6. XIV. The following have no portion in the world to come, but are cut off and perish, and for their great wickedness and sinfulness are condemned for ever and ever. Heretics and Epicureans;<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** <span dir=""rtl"">,אפיקורום</span> literally a follower of the freethinking school of Epicurus; extended scoffing sceptics.</i> those who deny the Torah, the resurrection of the dead or the coming of the Redeemer; apostates; those who cause a multitude to sin, and those who secede from the ways of the community; any one who commits transgressions like Jehoiakim, in high handed fashion and openly; informers; those who terrorise a community, not for a religious purpose; murderers and slanderers, and one who obliterates the physical mark of his Jewish origin."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.7","7. XV. Five Classes are termed Heretics; he who says that there is no God and the world has no ruler; he who says that there is a ruling power but that it is vested in two or more persons; he who says there is one ruler, but that He is a body and has form; he who denies that He alone is the First Cause and Rock of the Universe; likewise, he who renders worship to any one beside Him, to serve as a mediator between the human being and the Lord of the Universe. Whoever belongs to any of these five classes is termed a heretic."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.8","8. XVI. Three Classes are called Epicureans:<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** <span dir=""rtl"">,אפיקורום</span> literally a follower of the freethinking school of Epicurus; extended scoffing sceptics.</i> he who denies the reality of prophecy and maintains that there is no knowledge which emanates from the Creator and directly reaches the human mind; he who denies the prophecy of Moses, our teacher; and he who asserts that the Creator has no cognizance of the deeds of the children of men. Each of these classes consists of Epicureans. XVII. Three Classes are deniers of the Torah; he who says that the Torah is not of divine origin—even if he says of one verse, or of a single word, that Moses said it, of himself,<sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">*** Without divine authority.</i>—is a denier of the Torah; likewise, he who denies its interpretation, that is, the Oral Law, and repudiates its reporters, as Zadok and Boethus did; he who says that the Creator changed one commandment for another, and that this Torah, although of divine origin, is now obsolete, as the Nazarenes and Moslems assert. Everyone belonging to any of these classes is a denier of the Torah."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.9","9. XVIII. There are two classes of apostates—an apostate with respect to the violation of a single precept, and an apostate with respect to the whole Torah. The former is a person who has determined to violate a certain precept, commits the transgression habitually and has become notorious for it. Even if it is one of the lighter sins, as, for instance, if a person wears garments ""of diverse sorts"" (a mixture of wool and flax) (Deut. 22:11) or ""rounds the corner of his head"" (Lev. 19:27), doing so habitually, so that it appears that the precept is regarded by him as no longer binding, he is an apostate in regard to that particular observance, provided that he acted in a provocative spirit. An apostate with respect to the whole Torah is one, for example, who at a time of religious persecution becomes converted to the idolaters' religion, clings to them, saying, ""what advantage is it to me to adhere to the people of Israel, who are of low estate and persecuted. Better for me to join these nations who are powerful."" A person who acts thus is an apostate in respect to the whole Torah."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.10","10. XIX. Those who cause the multitude to sin, include one who induces others to sin, whether in a great matter, like Jeroboam, Zadok and Boethus, or in a light matter, even if he only induces them to nullify the observance of an affirmative precept; and any one who coerces others to sin, like Manasseh who put Israelites to death and so forced the people into idolatry; or deceives others and leads them astray."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.11","11. XX. One who separates himself from the Community, even if he does not commit a transgression but only holds aloof from the congregation of Israel, does not fulfill religious precepts in common with his people, shows himself indifferent when they are in distress, does not observe their fast, but goes his own way, as if he were one of the gentiles and did not belong to the Jewish people—such a person has no portion in the world to come. XXI. He, who, like Jehoiakim, commits transgressions arrogantly, whether these are light or grave offences, has no portion in the world to come. Such a one is called a shameless transgressor, because he exhibits effrontery and shamelessness and is unabashed by the words of the Torah."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.12","12. XXII. There are two classes of informers: one who delivers a coreligionist into the power of a heathen, who will put him to death or assault him; and one who delivers the property of a coreligionist to a heathen or to a despot, who is like a heathen. Both classes of informers have no portion in the world to come."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.13","13. XXIII. The terrorisers of a community, not for the sake of God, are those who rule a congregation arbitrarily so that all fear and are afraid of them—their aim, like that of the heathen kings, being to advance their own glory and interests but not to promote the glory of God."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.14","14. XXIV. All these twenty four classes which we have enumerated, even if they are Israelites, have no portion in the world to come. There are transgressions less grave than those mentioned, concerning which, however, the sages said that whoever habitually commits them will have no portion in the world to come. One should therefore avoid, and beware of such transgressors. XXV. They are one who gives another a nickname, calls another by his nickname, puts him to shame in public, seeks honour by another person's humiliation, contemns scholars or one's teachers, treats the festivals with contempt, desecrates things sacred. XXVI. When it is said that one who commits any of these sins has no portion in the world to come, the statement is to be understood as only applying to the sinner who dies impenitent. But if he repented of his wickedness and expired while still penitent, he is of those who will have a portion in the world to come; for there is nothing that stands in the way of repentance. Even if a person, throughout his life, denied the essential principle of religion and repented at the end, he will have a portion in the world to come; as it is said ""Peace, Peace to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith the Lord, and I will heal him"" (Is. 57:19). XXVII. All wicked persons, transgressors, apostates and the like, who come back penitent, whether openly or secretly, are accepted, as it is said, ""Return, ye backsliding children"" (Jer. 3:22). Even if one is still a backslider—since he only returns in secret and not openly—he is accepted if he repents."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.4.1","1. Twenty-four things hinder repentance. Four of them constitute grave offences. If one commits any of them, the Holy One, blessed be He, does not give him an opportunity to repent because of the enormity of his sin. Such sinners are the following: 1) He who leads a community to sin, and under this category comes one who prevents a community from fulfilling a religious duty; 2) he who turns his fellow-man from the good to the evil way, as, for instance, the seducer and the enticer (Deut. 13:3); 3) he who sees his son falling into vicious courses and does not check him. As the son is under his father's control, had the latter checked him, he would have renounced his evil course; hence, the father is considered to have induced his son to sin. Included in this category is any one who is able to check others,—an individual or a community—and does not do so, but permits them to stumble; 4) he who says, ""I will sin and then repent"". Included in this category is he who says, ""I will sin, and the Day of Atonement will secure my forgiveness""."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.4.2","2. II. Among those (twenty-four things), there are five offences which close the ways of repentance to those who commit them. Such sinners are the following: 1) He who separates himself from the community, because, when they repent, he will not be with them, and will therefore have no part in the merit they acquire; 2) he who opposes the <i>dicta</i> of the sages, because his opposition induces him to separate himself from them and he will consequently remain in ignorance of the ways of repentance; 3) he who makes mock of the divine precepts, for, since in his eyes they are contemptible, he will not eagerly seek them nor fulfil them; and if he does not fulfil them, how can he acquire merit ? 4) He who contemns his teachers; for such conduct will lead to his being thrust forth and expelled, as happened to Gehazi (II. Kings 5:27); and when he is expelled, he will find no one to teach him and show him the way of truth; 5) he who hates rebukes, since he does not leave himself a way to return, for it is rebuke that brings about repentance. When a person is told of his faults and is put to shame on their account, he repents, as it is written in the Torah, ""Remember, do not forget…. ye have been rebellious"" (Deut. 9:7); ""But the Lord hath not given you a heart to understand"" ((Deut. 29:3); ""O foolish people and unwise"" (Deut. 32:6). III.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* The Hebrew Manuscript has <span dir=""rtl"">ד</span> at the beginning of this paragraph and also of the next paragraph, and heads the following paragraph with <span dir=""rtl"">ו</span> instead of <span dir=""rtl"">ה</span>.</i> Thus too, Isaiah rebuked Israel and said, ""O sinful nation""….. (Is. 1:4); ""The ox knoweth his owner……"" (Is. 1:3); ""Because I know that thou art obstinate"" (Is. 48:4). And indeed God commanded him to rebuke sinners, as it is said, ""Cry aloud, spare not"" (Is. 58:1). Thus too, all the prophets rebuked Israel till they repented. Hence it is necessary to appoint in every community a great scholar, advanced in years, God-fearing from his youth and beloved by the people, to rebuke the multitude and cause them to repent. But he who hates rebukes will not go to the exhorter nor hear his words, and will therefore persist in his sins which seem good in his eyes."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.4.3","3. IV. Among those (twenty four things), there are five offences of such a nature that he who commits them cannot possibly return in perfect repentance, because they are sins against one's fellow-man and the sinner does not know to whom he has to make restitution, or of whom he has to ask pardon. Sinners of this class are the following: 1) He who curses a multitude, and not an individual of whom he might ask forgiveness; 2) he who shares with a thief, since he does not know who is the owner of the stolen property, the thief stealing from many persons and bringing him the stolen articles which he receives; furthermore, because the receiver encourages the thief and induces him to sin; 3) he who finds lost property and does not proclaim it, so as to restore it to its owner; after a time, when he repents, he does not know whom to restore it to; 4) he who despoils the poor, orphans or widows; for these people are in a pitiable condition, they are not well known, they emigrate from one city to another where they have no acquaintance, so that the wrongdoer cannot ascertain to whom the despoiled goods belong and should be restored; 5) he who takes bribes to prevert judgment; since he does not know how far his judgment has been perverted, nor the full extent of the consequences, so that he might make amends, for he will find excuses<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** The judge will say ""I have decided justly"" (so explained in the Keseph Mishnah).</i> for his conduct; furthermore, because he encourages the bribing ligitant and causes him to sin."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.4.4","4. V. Among those (twenty-four sins), there are five, concerning which it may be assumed that he who commits them will not repent of them; the reason being that they are regarded by most people as trivial, with the result that one sins and imagines that it is no sin. Offenders coming under this category are the following: 1) He who partakes of a meal that is insufficient for its owner. This is a minor<sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">*** Literally: ""dust of robbery"".</i> form of robbery; yet the guest imagines that he has not sinned and says (to himself) ""Did I eat aught without the owner's consent ?"" 2) he who uses a poor man's pledge. A poor man's pledge consists only of such articles as an axe or a plow, and the user says to himself: ""the articles have not been diminished; I have not robbed him"". 3) he who gazes at women whom it would be unlawful for him to marry, thinks that there is nothing wrong in it, and says to himself, ""Have I cohabited with her, or even drawn near to her ?""—and does not realise that the (lustful) look is a grave sin, for it leads to actual inchastity, as it is said, ""And that ye seek not after your heart and after your eyes"" (Num. 15:39). 4) he who seeks to obtain honour by disparaging another person and thinks to himself that this is no sin, since the other person is not present and has not suffered any shame. Moreover, the speaker did not actually shame him but only compared his own good deeds and wisdom with the other person's deeds or wisdom, so that it might be inferred that he himself is an honourable man, while the other is a contemptible fellow. 5) he who suspects the innocent, thinks to himself that he is not comitting a sin, and says, 'what have I done to him? Is there on my part anything more than a suspicion as to whether that person has done something or not ?' He does not however, realise that it is an iniquity, to regard a blameless man as possibly a transgressor."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.4.5","5. VI.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* In the Hebrew Manuscript, this is numbered</i> Belonging to the group, are five offences of such a nature that he who commits them will always be addicted to them and will find it hard to break away from them. Hence, a person should be on his guard lest he become habituated to them, seeing that they are all exceedingly pernicious habits. They are as follows: ""Tale-bearing, Evil Speech, Choleric Temper, Evil Thoughts; keeping company with a wicked person, for thus one learns his ways which become impressed on the heart. So Solomon said: ""But the companion of fools shall be broken"" (Prov. 13:20). In the laws dealing with moral dispositions, we have put together the qualities that all men should cultivate; how much more then, should the penitent do so."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.4.6","6. All offences enumerated above and their like, though they hinder repentance, do not prevent it. If a person repents of them, he is accepted as a penitent, and will have a portion in the world to come."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.5.1","1. Free Will is bestowed on every human being. If one desires to turn towards the good way and be righteous, he has the power to do so. If one wishes to turn towards the evil way and be wicked, he is at liberty to do so. And thus is it written in the Torah, ""Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil"" (Gen. 3:22)—which means that the human species had become unique in the world—there being no other species like it in the following respect, namely, that man, of himself and by the exercise of his own intelligence and reason, knows what is good and what is evil, and there is none who can prevent him from doing that which is good or that which is evil. And since this is so (there is reason to fear) ""lest he put forth his hand etc."" (ibid.)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.5.2","2. II. Let not the notion, expressed by foolish gentiles and most of the senseless folk among Israelites, pass through your mind that at the beginning of a person's existence, the Almighty decrees that he is to be either righteous or wicked. This is not so. Every human being may become righteous like Moses, our teacher, or wicked like Jeroboam; wise or foolish, merciful or cruel; niggardly or generous; and so with all other qualities. III. There is no one that coerces him or decrees what he is to do, or draws him to either of the two ways; but every person turns to the way which he desires, spontaneously and of his own volition. Thus Jeremiah said, ""out of the mouth of the Most High, proceedeth not evil and good"" (Lam. 3:38); that is to say, the Creator does not decree either that a man shall be good or that he shall be wicked. IV. Accordingly it follows that it is the sinner who has inflicted injury on himself; and he should therefore weep for, and bewail what he has done to his soul—how he has mistreated it. This is expressed in the next verse, ""Wherefore doth a living man complain, a strong man, because of his sins"" (Lam. 3:39). The prophet continues: since liberty of action is in our hands and we have, of our free will, committed all these evils, it behoves us to return in a spirit of repentance, and forsake our wickedness, for we have the power to do so. This thought is expressed in the next verse, ""Let us search and try our ways, and return to the Lord"" (Lam. 3.40)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.5.3","3. V. This doctrine is an important principle, the pillar of the Law and the Commandment, as it is said, ""see, I set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil"" (Deut. 30:15); and again it is written, 'Behold, I set before you this day, a blessing and a curse"" (Deut. 11:26). This means that the power is in your hands, and whatever a man desires to do among the things that human beings do, he can do, whether they are good or evil; and, because of this faculty, it is said, ""O that they had such a heart as this always"" (Deut. 5:26), which implies that the Creator neither puts compulsion on the children of men nor decrees that they should do either good, or evil, but it is all left to their discretion."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.5.4","4. VI. If God had decreed that a person should be either righteous or wicked, or if there were some force inherent in his nature which irresistibly drew him to a particular course, or to a special branch of knowledge, to special views or activities, as the foolish astrologers, out of their own fancy, pretend, how would the Almighty have charged us, through the prophets: 'Do this and do not do that, improve your ways, do not follow your wicked impulses', when, from the beginning of his existence, his destiny had already been decreed, or his innate constitution irresistibly drew him to that from which he could not set himself free ? What room would there be for the whole of the Torah ? By what right or justice could God punish the wicked or reward the righteous ? ""Shall not the Judge of all the earth act justly?"" (Gen. 18:25). VII. Do not, however, wonder: how can a man do whatever he desires, and act according to his discretion? Can aught in the world be done without the Master's Will and pleasure ? The Scripture itself says, ""Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that hath He done in heaven and on earth"" (Ps. 135:6). Know then that everything takes place according to His pleasure, notwithstanding that our acts are in our power. VIII. How so ? Just as it was the pleasure of the Creator that fire and air shall ascend, earth and water descend, and that the sphere shall revolve in a circle, and all other things in the Universe shall exist in their special ways which He desired, so it was His pleasure that Man should have liberty of will, and all his acts should be left to his discretion; that nothing should coerce him or draw him to aught, but that, of himself and by the exercise of his own mind which God had given him, he should do whatever it is in a man's power to do. IX. Hence, he is judged according to his deeds. If he does well, good is done to him; and if he does ill, evil is done to him. So the prophet says, ""This hath been of your doing"" (Mal. 1:9): ""Yea, they have chosen their own ways"" (Is. 66:3). On this theme Solomon said, ""Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth…. but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment"" (Eccles. 11:9); that is to say, realise that what you do is in your power, and that you will have to render an account."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.5.5","5. X. Perchance you will say, ""Does not the Almighty know everything that will be before it happens""? He either knows that this person will be righteous or wicked, or He does not know. If He knows that he will be righteous, it is impossible that he should not be righteous; and if you say that He knows that he will be righteous and yet it is possible for him to be wicked, then He does not know the matter clearly. XI. As to the solution of this problem, understand that ""the measure thereof is longer than the earth and wider than the sea"" (Job. 11:9), and many important principles of the highest sublimity are connected with it. You, however, need only to know and comprehend what I am about to say. XII. In the Second Chapter of the laws relating to the fundamental principles of the Torah, we have already explained that God does not know with a knowledge external to Himself, like human beings whose knowledge and self are separate entities, but He, blessed be His Name, and His knowledge are One. This, the human intellect cannot clearly apprehend. And just as it is not in human power to apprehend or discover the Creator's Real Essence, as it is said, ""For there shall no man see Me and live"" (Ex. 33:20), so it is not in human power to apprehend or discover the Creator's knowledge. So the prophet said, ""For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways"" (Is. 55:8). This being the case, we lack the capacity to know how God knows all creatures and their activities. XIII. Yet we do know beyond doubt that a human being's activities are in his own hands and the Almighty neither draws him on, nor decrees that he should act thus or not act thus. It is not religious tradition alone by which this is known. It is also supported by clear proofs furnished by science. Hence, it is said in the Prophetic writings that a man will be judged for all his deeds, according to his deeds, whether they be good or evil. And this is the principle on which all the words of Prophecy depend."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.6.1","1. There are many verses in the Pentateuch and in the Prophets which seem to contradict this fundamental doctrine. And they lead most people astray and make them think that God decrees that a person shall do good or evil, and that a man's heart is not under his control, to incline him in whichever direction he pleases. I will therefore expound an important principle by which you will learn the meaning of those verses. II. When an individual sins or the inhabitants of a country sin, and the sinner commits an offence, consciously and voluntarily, as above stated, it is proper that he be punished. God knows the way in which punishment should be exacted. In the case of some sins, justice requires that the sinner should be punished for his sin in this world, corporally or pecuniarily or through his little children; for a man's little children, who have as yet no understanding and have not arrived at the age of religious obligation, are their father's quasi-property, and the text ""Every man<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Every <i>man</i> but not a child.</i> shall be put to death for his own sin"" (Deut. 24:16) implies that one is not personally liable till he is an adult. III. Again, there are sins where justice requires that the punishment be inflicted in the life hereafter and the transgressor suffers no hurt here on earth. Other sins again there are, for which the penalty is exacted here and hereafter."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.6.2","2. The foregoing only applies in case the sinner has not repented. But if he repented, repentance serves as a shield against punishment. And as one sins, prompted by one's own mind and of his free will, so one repents, prompted by one's mind and will."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.6.3","3. IV. A man may commit so great a sin or such numerous sins that justice requires of the true judge, as the penalty to be exacted from this particular sinner for the sins, committed by him voluntarily and of his own mind, that repentance shall be withheld from him and liberty to turn from his wickedness shall not be accorded him, so that he may die and perish in the sins which he committed. So God saith through Isaiah, ""Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and close their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn and be healed"" (Is. 6:10); and thus it is said, ""But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against His people, till there was no remedy"" (II. Book of Chron. 36:16). This means that they sinned, of their own will, and multiplied transgressions to such an extent that they incurred the penalty of having repentance, which is the remedy for sin, withheld from them. V. Hence also, it is written in the Pentateuch, ""And I will harden Pharaoh's heart"" (Ex. 4:21). Because Pharaoh sinned on his own impulse and ill-treated the Israelites who sojourned in his land, as is said ""Come let us deal wisely with them…."" (Ex. 1:10), justice required that repentance should be withheld from him till retribution had been visited upon him. The Holy One, blessed be He, accordingly hardened his heart. VI. But why did He send him a message through Moses, bidding him 'release the Israelites and repent', when He had already told him 'thou wilt not release them', as it is said, ""But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not fear the Lord God"" (Ex. 9:30), ""But in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, (to show thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth)"" (Ex. 9:16)? The purpose was to instruct the inhabitants of the world<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* This purpose is indicated in the verse last quoted (Ex. 9:16).</i> that when the Almighty withholds repentance from the sinner, he cannot return, but will die in his wickedness which he had originally committed of his own will. VII. So Sihon, because of his iniquities, incurred the penalty of having repentance withheld from him, as it is said, ""for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day"" (Deut. 2:30). Thus too, because of the Canaanites' abominations, God withheld repentance from them till they waged war against Israel, as it is said, ""For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, to come against Israel, in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed"" Josh. 11:20). So with the Israelites in the days of Elijah; because they transgressed much, God withheld repentance from those who multiplied their transgressions, as it is said, ""For thou didst turn their heart backward"" (I. Kings 18:37); this means 'Thou has withheld repentance from them'. VIII. To sum up, God did not decree that Pharaoh should ill-treat Israel, or Sihon sin in his land, or that the Canaanites should commit abominations, or that Israel should worship idols. All of them sinned by their own volition; and all accordingly incurred the penalty that repentance should be withheld from them."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.6.4","4. IX. And thus the prophets and the righteous beseech the Almighty, in their prayers, to help them to the way of truth, as David said, ""Teach me, O Lord, thy way"", (Ps. 86:11); that is, 'May my sins not keep the way of truth from me, that I may learn from it Thy way and the Unity of Thy Name'. So also his prayer, ""let a noble spirit uphold me"" (Ps. 51:14) means, 'Suffer my spirit to accomplish its desire, and may not my sins cause repentance to be withheld from me, but let me have liberty, till I return and understand and know the way of truth'. Every text similar to the above can be explained in the same way."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.6.5","5. X. What is meant by David's utterance, ""Good and upright is the Lord; therefore He will teach sinners in the way; He will guide the meek in judgment and will teach the meek His way"" (Ps. 25:8)? It refers to the fact that God sent them prophets to teach them the ways of the Lord and bring them back in repentance; furthermore, that He endowed them with the capacity of learning and understanding. For it is characteristic of every human being that, when his interest is engaged in the ways of wisdom and righteousness, he longs for these ways and is eager to follow them. Thus the sages say, ""Whoever comes to purify himself receives aid""; that is, he will find himself helped in his endeavour. XI. But is it not written in the Torah ""And they shall serve them, and they shall afflict them"" (Gen. 15:13)? Did not then the Almighty decree that the Egyptians should do evil ? It is also written, ""And this people will rise up and go astray after the foreign gods of the land"" (Deut. 31:16). Did He not decree that Israel should worship idols ? Why then did He punish them ? (The answer is) that He did not decree concerning any particular individual that that individual should be the one to go astray. Any one of those who went astray and worshipped idols, had he not desired to commit idolatry, need not have done so. The Creator only instructed Moses as to what the future course of history would be, as one might say, 'This people will have among them righteous and wicked persons'. A wicked man has no right, on that account, to say that it had been decreed that he should be wicked, because the Almighty had informed Moses that among Israel there would be wicked men, just as the text, ""For the poor shall never cease out of the land"" (Deut. 15:11) (does not imply that any particular individual is destined to be poor). XII. So too with the Egyptians: Every one of those Egyptians who oppressed and ill-treated the Israelites could have refrained from doing so, had he not wished to hurt them. For God did not make a decree concerning any specific individual but only informed Abraham that his seed would be subjected to servitude in a land that was not theirs. We have already stated that it is beyond human power to understand the way in which God has cognizance of future events."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.1","1. Since every human being, as we have explained, has free will, a man should strive to repent, (make verbal confession of his sins<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* The Hebrew of the phrase in brackets <span dir=""rtl"">ולהתודות בפיו טִחטאיו</span> is not in the Manuscript, but in the printed editions.</i>) and renounce them, so that he may die penitent and thus be worthy of life in the world to come."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.2","2. II. A man should always regard himself as if his death were iminent and think that he may die this very hour, while still in a state of sin. He should therefore repent of his sins immediately and not say, 'When I grow old I shall repent', for he may die before he becomes old. So Solomon, in his wisdom, said, ""Let thy garments be always white, and oil on thy head not be lacking"" (Eccles. 9:8)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.3","3. III. Do not say that one need only repent of sinful deeds such as fornication, robbery and theft. Just as a man needs to repent of these sins involving acts, so he needs to investigate and repent of any evil dispositions that he may have, such as hot temper, hatred, jealousy, quarrelling,<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** <span dir=""rtl"">התחתרו</span> Omitted in printed editions.</i> scoffing, eager pursuit of wealth or honours, greediness in eating, and so on. Of all these faults one should repent. They are graver than sinful acts; for, when one is addicted to them it is difficult to give them up. And thus it is said, ""Let the wicked forsake his way and the man of iniquity his thoughts"" (Is. 55:7)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.4","4. IV. Let not the penitent suppose that he is kept far away from the degree attained by the righteous, because of the iniquities and sins that he had committed. This is not so. He is beloved by the Creator, desired by Him, as if he had never sinned. Moreover his reward is great; since, though having tasted sin, he renounced it and overcame his evil passions. The sages say, ""Where penitents stand, the completely righteous cannot stand"". This means, that the degree attained by penitents is higher than that of those who had never sinned, the reason being that the former have had to put forth a greater effort to subdue their passions than the latter."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.5","5. V. All the prophets charged the people concerning repentance. Only through repentance will Israel be redeemed, and the Torah already offered the assurance that Israel will, in the closing period of his exile, finally repent, and thereupon be immediately redeemed, as it is said, ""And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt take it to heart among all the nations, whither the Lord, thy God hath driven thee, and shalt return unto the Lord, thy God, and hearken to His voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have mercy upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the Lord, thy God, hath scattered thee"" (Deut. 30:1-3)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.6","6. VI. Great is repentance, for it brings men near to the Divine Presence, as it is said, ""Return, O Israel, unto the Lord, thy God"" (Hos. 14:2). Again, it is said, ""And ye have not returned unto Me, saith the Lord"" (Amos 4:6). Further, ""If thou return, O Israel, to Me shalt thou return"" (Jer. 4:1), which means 'If thou returnest in repentance, thou wilt cleave to Me'. VII. Repentance brings near those who are far away. But yesterday this person was odious before God, abhorred, estranged, an abomination. To-day he is beloved, desirable, near (to God), a friend. So you find that the same expression with which God thrusts sinners away from Him, He employs to bring the penitent near to Him, whether they are individuals or communities, as it is said, ""And instead of that which was said unto them: 'Ye are not my people', it shall be said unto them: 'Ye are children of the living God' "" (Hos. 2:1). Of Jeconiah, while he was wicked, it was said, ""Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days"" (Jer. 22:30); ""Though Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were a signet upon my right hand, (yet would I pluck thee thence)"" (Jer. 22:24). But after he had in his exile repented, it is said of his son, Zerubbabel, ""In that day, saith the Lord of Hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant, and will make thee as a signet, saith the Lord of hosts"" (Haggai 2:23)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.7","7. VIII. How exalted is the degree of repentance ? But last night a certain individual was separated from the Lord, God of Israel, as it is said, ""Your iniquities were making a separation between you and your God"" (Is. 59:2). He cries aloud and is not answered, as it is said, ""Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear"" (Is. 1:15). He fulfils religious precepts and they are flung back in his face, as it is said, ""who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts?"" (Is. 1:12); ""Oh that there were even one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on my altar in vain; I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand"" (Malachi 1:10); ""Add your burnt offerings unto your sacrifice and eat flesh"" (Jer. 7:21). IX. Today, the same individual (having repented) is closely attached to the Divine Presence, as it is said, ""And ye that cleave unto the Lord, your God, are alive, everyone of you this day"" (Deut. 4:4). He cries and is immediately answered, as it is said, ""And it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer"" (Is. 65:24). He fulfils religious precepts tnd they are accepted with pleasure and with joy, as it is said, ""For God hath already accepted thy works"" (Eccles. 9:7). Yet more, they are eagerly desired, as it is said, ""Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to the Lord as in the days of old and as in ancient years"" (Malachi 3:4)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.8","8. X. The right way for penitents is to be exceedingly humble and meek. If fools taunt them with their former deeds and say to them, 'But last night thou didst act thus and thus; last night, thou wast saying this and that', they should not be unpleasantly affected by them, but should listen and rejoice, realizing that this will be accounted a merit unto them. For when they are ashamed of their past deeds and humiliated because of them, their merit is increased and their worth enhanced. XI. It is however a grievous sin to say to a penitent 'Remember thy former doings', or to recall them in his presence, so as to shame him, or refer to similar incidents or topics, in order to remind him of what he had done. All this is forbidden and comes under the category of vexing another in words, against which the Torah warns us in the text ""Ye shall not vex one another"" (Lev. 25:17)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.1","1. The good reserved for the righteous is life in the world to come,—a life which is immortal, a good without evil. Thus is it written in the Torah ""that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days"" (Deut. 22:7); the traditional interpretation of which is as follows: ""that it may be well with thee"", in a world altogether good; ""that thou mayest prolong thy days"", in a world unending, that is, the world to come. II. The reward of the righteous is that they will attain this bliss and abide in this state of happiness; the punishment of the wicked is that they will not attain this life but will be cut off and die. He who does not attain this life will be dead, in the sense that he will never live again but will be cut off in his wickedness and perish like the brute beast. This is the penalty of <i>excision,</i> referred to in the Torah, as it is written, ""That soul shall utterly be cut off, his iniquity shall be upon him"" (Num. 15:31): which has been traditionally interpreted as follows: ""'cut off', in this world; ""utterly cut off', in the world to come"". This means that that soul, after its separation from the body (at the close of its existence) on earth, will not attain life in the world to come but will be cut off from that life also."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.2","2. III. In the world to come, there is nothing corporeal, and no material substance; there are only souls of the righteous without bodies,—like the ministering angels. And since in that world there are no bodies, there is neither eating there, nor drinking, nor aught that human beings need on earth. None of the conditions occur there which are incident to physical bodies in this world, such as sitting, standing, sleep, death, grief, merriment, etc. So the ancient sages said, ""In the life hereafter, there is no eating, no drinking, no connubial intercourse, but the righteous sit with their crowns on their heads and enjoy the radiance of the Shechinah""<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Divine Presence.</i>. IV. This passage clearly indicates that as there is no eating or drinking there, there is no physical body hereafter. The phrase ""the righteous sit""—is allegorical and means that the souls of the righteous exist there without labour or fatigue. The phrase ""their crowns on their heads"" refers to the knowledge they have acquired, and for the sake of which they have attained life in the world to come. This is their crown, in the same sense as where Solomon says ""with the crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him"" (Song of Songs 3:11). And just as in the text ""Everlasting joy shall be upon their heads"" (Is. 35:10), joy is not to be understood as a material substance that actually rests on the head, so 'the Crown', of which the sages here speak, is not to be taken literally but refers to knowledge. V. And what is the meaning of the sages' statement: ""they enjoy the radiance of the Shechinah""<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Divine Presence.</i>? It means that the righteous attain to a knowledge and realisation of the truth concerning God to which they had not attained while they were in the murky and lowly body."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.3","3. VI. The soul, whenever mentioned in this connection, is not the vital element requisite for bodily existence, but that form of soul which is identical with the intelligence which apprehends the Creator, as far as it is able, and apprehends other abstract concepts and other things. It is the psychic form, which we expounded in the Fourth Chapter of the Laws concerning the fundamental principles of the Torah. And it is this which, in this connection, is called Soul. VII. That life, as it is immortal,—death being only incidental to the body, which does not exist in the hereafter—is called 'the bond of life', as it is said, ""but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bond of life; and the souls of thine enemies, them he shall sling out….."" (I. Sam. 25:29). And this is a recompense than which there is none higher; a bliss beyond which there is nothing more blissful. And for this, all the prophets yearned."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.4","4. How many names have been metaphorically applied to it: 'The mountain of the Lord', 'His holy place', 'the way of holiness', 'the holy way', 'the courtyards of the Lord', 'the tent of the Lord', 'the beauty of the Lord', the temple of the Lord', 'the house of the Lord', 'the gate of the Lord'! The sages metaphorically call this bliss, destined for the righteous, 'the Banquet'. Its general name is 'the World to Come'."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.5","5. VIII. The severest retribution beyond which punishment can no further go, is that the soul shall be cut off and not attain the life hereafter, as it is said, ""That soul shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him""<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** Literally ""her iniquity shall be upon her""—referring to the soul.</i> (Num. 15:31). This destruction it is to which the prophets metaphorically apply the terms 'the Pit of destruction', 'Abaddon', 'Tophet', 'Leech'; and all other expressions which connote cessation and destruction are applied to it, because it is a ruin that is irreparable and a loss which is irrecoverable."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.6","6. IX. Possibly you may esteem this boon (of life hereafter) lightly, and imagine that the only reward for fulfilling religious precepts and walking consistently in the ways of truth is to enjoy good food and drink; to have intercourse with 'beautiful forms'; to wear fine linen and brocade; to dwell in palaces of ivory; to be served on gold and silver plate and enjoy similar things, as indeed those foolish and silly Arabs, who lead dissolute lives, imagine. X. The wise and intelligent know, however, that all these pleasures are exaggerated and inane, and there is no profit in them. They are regarded by us as a great boon because we are beings with physical bodies and material frames which have need of all these things. The soul only desires and longs for them because they are necessary to the body, and enable it to attain its needs and maintain its health; and when the body ceases to exist, all these things become null and void. XI. As to the blissful state of the soul in the world to come, there is no way on earth in which we can comprehend or know it. For in this earthly existence we only have knowledge of physical pleasure; and it is for this that we long. But the bliss of the life hereafter is exceedingly great, and can only metaphorically be compared with earthly enjoyments. In reality, however, there is no comparison between the bliss of the soul in the life hereafter and the gratification afforded to the body on earth by food and drink. That spiritual bliss is unsearchable and beyond compare. So David said, ""How great is Thy goodness which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee"" (Ps. 31:19)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.7","7. How David yearned and longed for the life in the world to come, as it is said, ""Had I not believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living'…. (Ps. 27:13). XII. The ancient sages taught us that a clear comprehension of the bliss in the life hereafter is unattainable to any man. None but God knows its grandeur, beauty and power. All the boons which the prophets prophesied to Israel only refer to material things that Israel will enjoy in the days of King Messiah, when sovereignty will be restored to Israel. XIII. But as for the bliss in the world to come, nought can be compared with, or likened to it. And the prophets did not depict it, so as not to depreciate it by their imaginary picture. Thus Isaiah said, ""Eye hath not seen beside Thee, O God, what He prepareth for him that waiteth for Him"" (Is. 64:3); that is, the bliss which neither the eye of the prophet nor any one else but God, hath seen, He hath prepared for the man who waits for Him. The sages say, ""All the prophets only prophesied concerning the days of the Messiah. But the world to come, ""no eye hath seen but Thine, O God""."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.8","8. XIV. The reason why the sages styled it 'The World to Come' is not because it is not now in existence and will only come into being when this world shall have passed away. That is not so. The world to come now exists, as it is said, ""which Thou hast treasured up (for them that fear Thee), which Thou hast wrought (for them that trust in Thee before the children of men"") (Ps. 31:19-20). It is called the World to Come, only because human beings will enter into it at a time subsequent to the life of the present world in which we now exist with body and soul,—and this existence comes first."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.9.1","1. It is known that the reward for the fulfilment of the commandments and the good to which we will attain if we have kept the way of the Lord, as prescribed in the Law, is life in the World to Come, as it is said, ""That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days"" (Deut. 22:7), while the retribution exacted from the wicked who have abandoned the ways of righteousness prescribed in the Torah is excision, as it is said, ""that soul shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him"" (Num. 15:31). What then is the meaning of the statement found everywhere in the Torah that 'if ye obey, it will happen to you thus; if ye do not obey, it will be otherwise'; and all these happenings will take place in this world, such as war and peace; sovereignty and subjection; residence in the Promised Land, and exile; prosperity in one's activities and failure, and all the other things predicted in the words of the Covenant (Lev. ch. 26. Deut. ch. 28)? II. All those promises were (once) truly (fulfilled) and will again be so. When we fulfil all the commandments of the Torah, all the good things of this world will come to us. When however we transgress the precepts, the evils that are written in the Torah will befall us. But nevertheless, those good things are not the final reward for the fulfilment of the commandments, nor are those evils the last penalty exacted from one who transgresses all the commandments. These matters are to be understood as follows: III. The Holy One, blessed be He, gave us this Law—a tree of lfie. Whoever fulfills what is written therein and knows it with a complete and correct knowledge will attain thereby life in the World to Come. According to the greatness of his deeds and abundance of his knowledge will be the measure in which he will attain that life. He has further promised us in the Torah, that, if we observe its behests joyously and cheerfully, and continually meditate on its wisdom, He will remove from us the obstacles that hinder us in its observance, such as sickness, war, famine, and other calamities; and will bestow upon us all the material benefits which will strengthen our ability to fulfil the Law, such as plenty, peace, abundance of silver and gold. IV. Thus we will not be engaged, all our days, in providing for our bodily needs, but will have leisure to study wisdom and fulfil the commandment, and thus attain life in the World to Come. Hence, after the assurance of material benefits, it is said in the Torah, ""And it shall be righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all this commandment before the Lord, our God, as He hath commanded us"" (Deut. 6:25). V. So too, He taught us in the Torah that if we deliberately forsake it and occupy ourselves with temporal follies, as the text says, ""But Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked"" (Deut. 32:15),—the true Judge will deprive the forsakers of all those material benefits which only served to encourage them to be recalcitrant, and will send upon them all the calamities that will prevent their attaining the life hereafter, so that they will perish in their wickedness. This is expressed by the Torah in the text: ""Because thou didst not serve the Lord, thy God, with joyfulness and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things, therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy whom the Lord shall send against thee""<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* The order of the sentences in this text, correctly given as it is in the Torah, is reversed in the Hebrew manuscript, possibly not to end with calamitous maledictions.</i> (Deut. 28:47-48). VI. Hence, all those benedictions and maledictions are to be explained as follows: If you have served God with joy and observed His way, He will bestow upon you those blessings and avert from you those curses, so that you will have leisure to become wise in the Torah and occupy yourselves therewith, and thus attain life hereafter, and then it will be well with you in the world which is entirely blissful and you will enjoy length of days in an existence which is everlasting. So you will enjoy both worlds,—a happy life on earth leading to the life in the World to Come. For if wisdom is not acquired and good deeds are not performed here, there will be nought meriting a recompense hereafter, as it is said, ""for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave"" (Eccles. 9:10). VII. But if you have forsaken the Lord and have erred in eating, drinking, fornication, and similar things, He will bring upon you all those curses and withhold from you all those blessings till your days will end in confusion and terror, and you will have neither the free mind nor the healthy body requisite for the fulfilment of the commandments so that you will suffer perdition in the life hereafter and will thus have lost both worlds,—for when one is troubled here on earth with diseases, war or famine, he does not occupy himself with the acquisition of wisdom or the performance of religious precepts by which life hereafter is gained."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.9.2","2. VIII. Hence, all Israelites, their prophets and sages, longed for the advent of Messianic times, that they might have relief from the wicked tyranny that does not permit them properly to occupy themselves with the study of the Torah and the observance of the commandments; that they might have ease, devote themselves to getting wisdom, and thus attain to life in the World to Come. IX. For in those days, knowledge, wisdom and truth will increase, as it is said ""For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord"" (Is. 11:9), and it is said, ""They will no more teach everyone his brother and everyone his neighbour"" (Jer. 31:34), and further, ""I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh"" (Ezek 36:26). X. Because the King who will arise from the seed of David will possess more wisdom than Solomon and will be a great prophet, approaching Moses, our teacher<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* In the M.S. ""nearer than our teacher Moses"". <span dir=""rtl"">ונביא גדול הוא קרוב ממשה</span> This may be a scribal error, and should be corrected to <span dir=""rtl"">קרוב למשה</span></i>, he will teach the whole of the Jewish people and instruct them in the way of God; and all nations will come to hear him, as it is said, ""And at the end of days it shall come to pass that the Mount of the Lord's house shall be established as the top of the mountains"" (Micah 4:1, Is. 2:2). XI. The ultimate and perfect reward, the final bliss which will suffer neither interruption nor diminution is the life in the world to come. The Messianic era, on the other hand, will be realized in this world; which will continue in its normal course except that independent sovereignty will be restored to Israel. The ancient sages already said, ""The only difference between the present and the Messianic era is that political oppression will then cease."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.10.1","1. Let not a man say, 'I will observe the precepts of the Torah and occupy myself with its wisdom, in order that I may obtain all the blessings written in the Torah, or to attain life in the world to come; I will abstain from transgressions against which the Torah warns, so that I may be saved from the curses written in the Torah, or that I may not be cut off from life in the world to come.' II. It is not right to serve God after this fashion for whoever does so, serves Him out of fear. This is not the standard set by the prophets and sages. Only those serve God in this way, who are illiterate, women or children whom one trains to serve out of fear, till their knowledge shall have increased when they will serve out of love."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.10.2","2. III. Whoever serves God out of love, occupies himself with the study of the Law and the fulfilment of commandments and walks in the paths of wisdom, impelled by no external motive whatsoever, moved neither by fear of calamity nor by the desire to obtain material benefits; such a man does what is truly right because it is truly right, and ultimately, happiness comes to him as a result of his conduct. IV. This standard is indeed a very high one; not every sage attained to it. It was the standard of the patriarch Abraham whom God called His lover, because he served only out of love. It is the standard which God, through Moses, bids us achieve, as it is said, ""And thou shalt love the Lord, thy God"" (Deut. 6:5). When one loves God with the right love, he will straightway observe all the commandments out of love."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.10.3","3. V. What is the love of God that is befitting ? It is to love the Eternal with a great and exceeding love, so strong that one's soul shall be knit up with the love of God, and one should be continually enraptured by it, like a love-sick individual, whose mind is at no time free from his passion for a particular woman, the thought of her filling his heart at all times, when sitting down or rising up, when he is eating or drinking. Even intenser should be the love of God in the hearts of those who love Him. And this love should continually possess them, even as He commanded us in the phrase, ""with all thy heart and with all thy soul"" (Deut. 6:5). This, Solomon expressed allegorically in the sentence, ""for I am sick with love"" (Song of Songs 2:5). The entire Song of Songs is indeed an allegory descriptive of this love."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.10.4","4. VI. The ancient sages said; Peradventure, you will say, 'I will study Torah, in order that I may become rich, that I may be called Rabbi, that I may receive a reward in the world to come'. It is therefore said, ""To love the Lord"". Whatever you do, do is out of love only. VII. The text: ""(Happy is the man that feareth the Lord), that delighteth greatly in His commandments"" (Ps. 112:1) has been thus explained by the sages—""<i>In His commandments</i>—not in the reward for His commandments"". So too, the greatest sages were wont specifically to exhort those among their disciples who were understanding and intelligent ""Be not like servants who minister to their master, upon the condition of receiving a reward"" (Ethics of the Fathers 1:3). But it is proper to be like servants who serve their master not for the sake of receiving aught; but only because he is the master, it is right to serve him; that is, serve him out of love."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.10.5","5. VIII. Whoever engages in the study of the Torah, in order that he may receive a reward or avoid calamities is not studying the Torah for its own sake. Whoever occupies himself with the Torah, neither out of fear nor for the sake of recompense, but solely out of love for the Lord of the whole Earth who enjoined us to do so, is occupied with the Torah for its own sake. The sages however said, ""One should always engage in the study of the Torah, even if not for its own sake; for he who begins thus will end by studying it for its own sake"". IX. Hence, when instructing the young, women or the illiterate generally, we teach them to serve God out of fear or for the sake of reward, till their knowledge increases and they have attained a large measure of wisdom. Then we reveal to them this mystic truth, little by little, and train them by easy stages till they have grasped and comprehended it, and serve God out of love."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.10.6","6. X. It is known and certain that the love of God does not become closely knit in a man's heart till he is continuously and thoroughly possessed by it and gives up everything else in the world for it; as God commanded us, ""with all thy heart and with all thy soul"" (Deut. 6:5). One only loves God with the knowledge with which one knows Him. According to the knowledge, will be the love. If the former be little or much, so will the latter be little or much. XI. A person ought therefore to devote himself to the understanding and comprehension of those sciences and studies which will inform him concerning his Master, as far as it lies in human faculties to understand and comprehend—as indeed we have explained in the Laws of the Foundations of the Torah."

The number of chapters in this book are forty-six; namely, laws of the fundamental principles of the Torah, ten chapters; laws of Moral Dispositions, seven chapters; laws of the Study of the Torah, seven chapters; laws of Idolatry, twelve chapters; laws of Repentance, ten chapters."

"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.1.1","1. Every human being is characterised by numerous moral dispositions which differ from each other and are exceedingly divergent. One man is choleric, always irascible; another sedate, never angry; or, if he should become angry, is only slightly and very rarely so. One man is haughty to excess; another humble in the extreme. One is a sensualist whose lusts are never sufficiently gratified; another is so pure in soul that he does not even long for the few things that our physical nature needs. One is so greedy that all the money in the world would not satisfy him, as it is said, ""He who loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver"". (Eccles. 5:9). Another so curbs his desires that he is contented with very little, even with that which is insufficient, and does not bestir himself to obtain that which he really needs. One will suffer extreme hunger for the sake of saving, and does not spend the smallest coin without a pang, while another deliberately and wantonly squanders all his property. In the same way, men differ in other traits. There are, for example, the hilarious and the melancholy, the stingy and the generous, the cruel and the merciful, the timid and the stout-hearted, and so forth."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.1.2","2. Between any moral disposition and its extreme opposite, there are intermediate dispositions more or less removed from each other. Of all the various dispositions, some belong to one from the beginning of his existence and correspond to his physical constitution. Others are such that a particular individual's nature is favourably predisposed to them and prone to acquire them more rapidly than other traits. Others again are not innate, but have been either learnt from others, or are self-originated, as the result of an idea that has entered the mind or, having heard that a certain disposition is good for him and should be cultivated by him, one trained himself in it till it became part of his nature."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.1.3","3. To cultivate either extreme in any class of dispositions is not the right course nor is it proper for any person to follow or learn it. If a man finds that his nature tends or is disposed to one of these extremes, or if one has acquired and become habituated to it, he should turn back and improve, so as to walk in the way of good people, which is the right way."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.1.4","4. The right way is the mean in each group of dispositions common to humanity; namely, that disposition which is equally distant from the two extremes in its class, not being nearer to the one than to the other. Hence, our ancient sages exhorted us that a person should always evaluate his dispositions and so adjust them that they shall be at the mean between the extremes, and this will secure his physical health. Thus a man should not be choleric, easily moved to anger, nor be like the dead without feeling; but should aim at the happy medium; be angry only for a grave cause that rightly calls for indignation, so that the like shall not be done again. He will only desire that which the body absolutely needs and cannot do without, as it is said, ""The righteous eats, to satisfy himself"" (Prov. 13:25). He will only labour at his occupation to obtain what is necessary for his sustenance, as it is said, ""A little that a righteous man hath is better [than the riches of many wicked""] (Ps. 37:16). He will not be tight-fisted nor yet a spendthrift, but will bestow charity according to his means and give a suitable loan to whoever needs it. He will be neither frivolous and given to jesting, nor mournful and melancholy, but will rejoice all his days tranquilly and cheerfully. And so will he comport himself with regard to all his other dispositions. This is the way of the wise. Whoever observes in his dispositions the mean is termed wise."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.1.5","5. Whoever is particularly scrupulous and deviates somewhat from the exact mean in disposition, in one direction or the other, is called a saint. For example, if one avoids haughtiness to the utmost extent and is exceedingly humble, he is termed a saint, and this is the standard of saintliness. If one only departs from haughtiness as far as the mean, and is humble, he is called wise, —and this is the standard of wisdom. And so with all other dispositions. The ancient saints trained their dispositions away from the exact mean towards the extremes; in regard to one disposition in one direction; in regard to another in the opposite direction. This was supererogation. We are bidden to walk in the middle paths which are the right and proper ways, as it is said, ""and thou shalt walk in His ways"" (Deut. 28:9)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.1.6","6. In explanation of the text just quoted, the sages taught, ""Even as God is called gracious, so be thou gracious; Even as He is called merciful, so be thou merciful; even as He is called holy, so be thou holy"". Thus too the prophets described the Almighty by all the various attributes ""long-suffering and abounding in kindness, righteous and upright, perfect, mighty and powerful,"" and so forth, to teach us, that these qualities are good and right and that a human being should cultivate them, and thus imitate God, as far as he can."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.1.7","7. How shall a man train himself in these dispositions, so that they become ingrained? Let him practise again and again the actions prompted by those dispositions which are the mean between the extremes, and repeat them continually till they become easy and are no longer irksome to him, and so the corresponding dispositions will become a fixed part of his character. And as the Creator is called by these attributes, which constitute the middle path in which we are to walk, this path is called the Way of God and this is what the patriarch Abraham taught his children, as it is said ""For I love him, because he will charge his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord"" (Gen. 18:19). Whoever walks in this way secures for himsself happiness and blessing, as the text continues, ""In order that the Lord might bring upon Abraham that which He spoke concerning him"" (Gen. 18:19)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.2.1","1. To those who are sick in body, the bitter tastes as if it were sweet, and the sweet as if it were bitter. Among sick folk, some long and yearn for things unfit for food, such as earth and charcoal, and have an aversion to wholesome foods, like bread and meat—the perversity depending on the severity of the illness. Similarly, human beings whose souls are sick and love evil dispositions, and hate the way that is good and are too indolent to walk therein, and find it exceedingly irksome because of their sickness. And so Isaiah says of such people, ""O, they that say of evil that it is good, and of good that it is evil, that turn darkness into light and light into darkness, who take bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter"" (Is. 5:20). And of such it is also said, ""Who forsake the paths of integrity to walk in the ways of darkness"" (Prov. 2:13). What is the corrective for those that are sick in soul ? They should go to the wise who are physicians of the soul and they will heal their maladies by instructing them in the dispositions which they should acquire till they are restored to the right path. Of those who realise that their dispositions are bad and nevertheless do not resort to the wise to be cured, Solomon says, ""Wisdom and discipline, fools despise"" (Prov. 1:7)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.2.2","2. What is the method of effecting their cure ? If one is irascible, he is directed so to govern himself that even if he is assaulted or reviled, he should not feel affronted. And in this course he is to persevere for a long time till the choleric temperament has been eradicated. If one is arrogant, he should accustom himself to endure much contumely, sit below every one, and wear old and ragged garments that bring the wearer into contempt, and so forth, till arrogance is eradicated from his heart and he has regained the middle path, which is the right way. And when he has returned to this path, he should walk in it the rest of his days. On similar lines, he should treat all his dispositions. If, in any of them, he is at one extreme, he should move to the opposite extreme, and keep to it for a long time till he has regained the right path which is the normal mean in every class of dispositions."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.2.3","3. There are some dispositions in regard to which it is forbidden merely to keep to the middle path. They must be shunned to the extreme. Such a disposition is pride. The right way in this regard is not to be merely meek, but to be humble-minded and lowly of spirit to the utmost. And therefore was it said of Moses that he was ""<i>exceedingly</i> meek,"" (Num. 12:3), not merely that he was ""meek"". Hence, our sages exhorted us, ""Be exceedingly, exceedingly lowly of spirit"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:4). They also said that any one who permits his heart to swell with haughtiness has denied the essential principle of our religion, as it is said, ""And thy heart will be proud, and thou wilt forget the Lord, thy God"" (Deut. 8:14). Again have they said, ""Under a ban be he who is proud, even in the smallest degree"". Anger too, is an exceedingly bad passion, and one should avoid it to the last extreme. One should train oneself not to be angry even for something that would justify anger. If one wishes to arouse fear in his children and household, or in the members of a community of which he is the head, and desires to exhibit anger, so that they may amend their ways, he should make a show of anger before them, so as to correct them, but in reality, his mind should be composed like that of a man who simulates anger and does not really feel it. The ancient sages said, ""He who is angry—it is the same as if he worshipped idols."" They also said, ""One who yields to anger, —if he is a sage, his wisdom departs from him; if he is a prophet, his prophetic gift departs from him."" Those of an irate disposition—their life is not worth living. The sages therefore, charged us that anger should be avoided to such a degree that one should train oneself to be unmoved even by things that naturally would provoke anger; and this is the good way. The practice of the righteous is to suffer contumely and not inflict it; to hear themselves reproached, not retort; to be impelled in what they do by love, and to rejoice in suffering. Of them Scripture saith, ""And they that love Him are like the going forth of the sun in his strength."" (Judges 5:31)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.2.4","4. One should always cultivate the habit of silence, and only converse on topics of wisdom or on matters of moment to one's existence. Of Rav, disciple of our sainted teacher (R. Judah, the Prince) it was said that throughout his life he never indulged in idle conversation, of which most people's talk consists. And even of our material needs, we should not speak much. In this connection, our wise men charged, ""He who multiplies words causes sin"" (Ethics of the Fathers, 1:17). They further said, ""I have found naught of better service to the body than silence"" (ibid.). So too, in discussing Torah and Wisdom, a man's words should be few but full of meaning. This, the sages express in their recommendation: ""A man should always teach his disciples tersely"". But where words are many and their meaning is small—that is folly, of which it is said, ""For the dream cometh with much discussion, and a fool's voice with an abundance of words"" (Eccles. 5:2)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.2.5","5. ""A fence to wisdom is silence"" (Ethics of the Fathers, 3:17). Hence, a man should not be hasty in reply, nor talk much. He should teach his pupils gently and calmly, not shouting, and avoiding prolixity. Solomon said, ""The words of the wise, spoken quietly, are heard"" (Eccles. 9:17)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.2.6","6. It is forbidden to accustom oneself to smooth speech and flatteries. One must not say one thing and mean another. Inward and outward self should correspond; only what we have in mind, should we utter with the mouth. We must deceive no one, not even an idolater. A man, for example, must not sell to an idolater flesh from a beast that has died naturally, as if it were meat of an animal ritually slaughtered. Nor should one sell a shoe, the leather of which came from the hide of a beast that met with a natural death, allowing it to be believed that the leather had come from the hide of a ritually slaughtered animal. One must not urge another to join one at a meal, when one is aware that the invitation will not be accepted. Nor should one press upon another any marks of friendship which one knows will be declined. So too, casks of wine, which must be opened for sale, should not be broached in such a way as to deceive a guest and make him believe that they had been opened in his honour, and so forth. Even a single word of flattery or deception is forbidden. A person should always cherish truthful speech, an upright spirit and a pure heart free from all frowardness and perversity."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.2.7","7. One should not indulge in jesting and mockery nor be melancholy and mournful, but one should be cheerful. So our sages said, ""Jesting and levity lead a man on to lewdness"" (Ethics of the Fathers, 3:17). They further charged that a man should not give way to immoderate laughter, nor yet be sad and mournful but should receive everyone with a cheerful countenance. One should also not cherish large desires—hurrying to get rich, — nor be melancholy and idle, but should be contented, engage a little in secular occupation and devote oneself to the study of the Torah, and rejoice in the little one has as his portion. One should not be quarrelsome, jealous, or sensual; nor run after honour. Thus our wise men said, ""Envy, lust and ambition take a man from the world"" (Ethics of Fathers, 4:2). In fine, in every class of dispositions, a man should choose the mean so that all one's dispositions shall occupy the exact middle between the extremes. This is what Solomon expressed in the text, ""Balance the course of thy steps, so that all thy ways may be right"" (Prov. 4:26)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.3.1","1. Possibly a person may say: ""Since envy, cupidity and ambition are evil qualities to cultivate and lead to a man's ruin, I will avoid them to the uttermost, and seek their contraries."" A person following this principle, will not eat meat, nor drink wine, nor marry nor dwell in a decent home, nor wear comely apparel, but will clothe himself in sackcloth and coarse wool like the idolaters' priests. This too, is the wrong way, not to be followed. Whoever persists in such a course is termed a sinner. Of the Nazirite, it is said ""He (the priest) shall make atonement for him, for the sin that he committed against the soul."" (Num. 6:11). On this text, the Sages comment, ""If the Nazirite who only abstained from wine stands in need of an atonement, how much more so one who deprives himself of all legitimate enjoyments."" The Sages accordingly enjoined us that we should only refrain from that which the Torah has expressly withdrawn from our use. And no one should, by vows and oaths, inhibit to himself the use of things permitted. ""Do not the prohibitions of the Torah"", say our sages, ""suffice thee, that thou addest others for thyself ?"" In this condemnation, those are included, who make a practice of fasting; they too are not walking in the right way; our wise men prohibited self-mortification by fasting. And concerning this and similar excesses Solomon exhorts us, ""Be not overrighteous, nor excessively wise. Wherefore shouldst thou be desolate?"" (Eccles. 7:16)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.3.2","2. A man should direct all his thoughts and activities to the knowledge of God, alone. This should be his aim in sitting, rising and conversation. How should this be caried out ? Whether engaged in commerce or in manual labour for profit, one's heart should not be solely set on the accumulation of wealth, but he should do these things in order to obtain therewith his bodily needs—food, drink, shelter, the demands of married life. So too, when he eats, drinks, or cohabits, his purpose should not be to secure physical gratification, in which case he would only eat and drink that which was pleasing to the palate, and cohabit for the sake of sensual pleasure, but he should have it in mind that he eats and drinks solely to maintain his body and its organs in health and vigour. He will then not partake of everything which the palate craves, like a dog or an ass, but will choose foods that are wholesome to the body, whether these be sweet or bitter; and will avoid eating things that are injurious to the body, even though they taste sweet. One, for instance, who is of a hot humour, will not eat flesh-meat or honey, nor drink wine, as Solomon said in a metaphorical sense, ""It is not good to eat much honey"". (Prov. 25:27). Such a person should rather drink an infusion of chicory, even though it is bitter. And so, since life is impossible without eating and drinking, he will be guided in his choice of food and drink by hygienic considerations, to recover and maintain sound health. Thus too, in married life, his purpose in cohabitation will be to preserve health or propagate his species. He will consequently not indulge in intercourse whenever the desire seizes him, but only when he is conscious that emission is hygienically necessary or when his purpose is to continue his race."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.3.3","3. He who regulates his life in accordance with the laws of hygiene, with the sole motive of maintaining a sound and vigorous physique and begetting children to do his work and labour for his benefit, is not following the right course. A man should aim to maintain physical health and vigour, in order that his soul may be upright, in a condition to know God. For it is impossible for one to understand sciences and meditate upon them, when he is hungry or sick, or when any of his limbs is aching. And in cohabitation, one should set one's heart on having a son who may become a sage and a great man in Israel. Whoever throughout his life follows this course will be continually serving God, even while engaged in business and even during cohabitation, because his purpose in all that he does will be to satisfy his needs. so as to have a sound body with which to serve God. Even when he sleeps and seeks repose, to calm his mind and rest his body, so as not to fall sick and be incapacitated from serving God, his sleep is service of the Almighty. In this sense, our wise men charged us, ""Let all thy deeds be for the sake of God."" (Ethics of the Fathers 2: 17). And Solomon, in his wisdom, said, ""In all thy ways know Him, and He will make thy paths straight."" (Prov. 3:6)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.1","1. Since, by keeping the body in health and vigour, one walks in the ways of God—it being impossible during sickness to have any understanding or knowledge of the Creator—it is a man's duty to avoid whatever is injurious to the body, and cultivate habits conducive to health and vigour. These are as follows: One should not take food except when one is hungry; nor drink unless one is thirsty. One should not neglect the calls of nature for a single moment, but respond to them immediately."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.2","2. Food should not be taken to repletion; during a meal, about one-third less should be eaten than the quantity that would give a feeling of satiety, and only a little water should be drunk—and that mixed with wine. After the process of digestion has commenced, water may be taken as needed. But even after food has been digested, it should not be drunk copiously. Before eating, careful attention should be paid to the functions of excretion. No meal should be taken without previously walking till the body begins to get warm, or engaging in manual labour, or tiring oneself with other activities. In short, strenuous exercise should be taken every day in the morning, till the body is in a glow. Then, there should be an interval of rest till one has recovered composure. The meal may then be taken. If the exercise is followed by a bath of warm water, so much the better. In this case too, there should be an interval for repose before the meal."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.3","3. During a meal, one should sit or recline on the left side; but not walk, ride, take violent exercise, sway the body, or engage in sport, till the food is digested. Any one who engages in sport or violent exercise immediately after a meal, subjects himself to grave disorders."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.4","4. The day and night consist of twenty-four hours. It is sufficient to sleep for a third of that period, namely eight hours. And these hours should be in the latter part of the night; that is to say, the period from retirement to dawn should be eight hours so that one will rise from his bed before dawn."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.5","5. One should not sleep, face downwards, nor on one's back, but lying on the side; at the beginning, on the left side, and at the close of one's rest, on the right side. One should not go to sleep immediately after a meal, but only when three or four hours have elapsed. One should not sleep during the day."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.6","6. Laxative foods, such as grapes, figs, mulberries, pears, watermelons, the various kinds of cucumbers or gherkins, should be taken before the meal. These, however, should not be mixed with the main dish that constitutes the meal. An interval should elapse till these have passed out of the stomach before the meal is taken. Immediately after, foods that tone up the digestive organs, should be eaten, such as pomegranates, quinces, apples and small pears;<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* See <i>Tifereth Israel</i> (Commentary) on <i>Mishnah Kilaim</i> 1:3, note 41.</i> but even these fruits must not be indulged in too freely."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.7","7. When it is desired to eat at the same meal poultry and the meat of cattle, the poultry should be eaten first. When eggs and poultry form part of the same meal, the eggs should be consumed first. When the meat of large and of small cattle are eaten at the same meal, the latter should come first. The lighter should always precede the heavier diet."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.8","8. In the summer time, cold food should be consumed; one should be sparing with condiments; vinegar should be used. During winter, warm foods should be eaten; condiments should be liberally used with a little mustard and assafoetida. A similar plan should be followed in cold and warm countries. The diet, in every district, should be chosen to suit the climate."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.9","9. Some foods are very injurious and ought never be eaten. For example, large salted stale fish; salted stale cheese; truffles and mushrooms; stale salted meat; <i>must</i> (fresh wine taken from the wine press); cooked food kept so long that it has lost its savour; any food that is malodorous or very bitter—all these are like deadly poison to the body. There are other kinds of food that are injurious but not to the same extent as those just mentioned. A little of them at a time may therefore be taken, but only at intervals of several days. One should not accustom oneself to make a meal of them or to eat them regularly with the meal. Examples of this class are large fish; cheese; milk, twenty-four hours after milking; the meat of big steers and big goats; beans, lentils, peas; barley bread; unleavened bread; cabbage; leeks, onions, garlic; mustard and raddish. All these are bad foods. They should be eaten very sparingly and only during winter. In the summer, they should not be eaten at all. Neither in summer nor in winter should beans or lentils be eaten as a separate dish. Gourds may be eaten in summer."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.10","10. There are other kinds of food that are also bad, but not to the extent of those just mentioned. These are waterfowl, small young pigeons, dates, bread fried in oil or the dough of which was kneaded with oil, fine meal so completely sifted that not a trace of bran remained, meat juice, and brine of salted fish. These should not be freely used. A man who is wise and exercises self-control, who does not yield to his appetite and never partakes of the above named foods, unless he needs them as a medicine, is indeed a hero !"
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.11","11. One should always be abstemious in regard to fruits which grow on trees. These should not be eaten freely, even when dried, and, needless to add, when they are fresh. Before they are quite ripe, thy are like daggers to the body. So too locust (St. John's bread) is always bad. All sour fruits are bad and should be eaten sparingly, and only during summer or in hot climates. But figs, grapes and almonds are always good to eat—whether fresh or dried and may be eaten as much as one needs; but they should not be eaten constantly, even though they are the best of the tree-fruits."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.12","12. Honey and wine are bad for young children, but good for the aged, particularly in the winter. The quantity taken in the summer should be two-thirds of that consumed in the winter."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.13","13. At every period of life, it should be one's care to secure free action of the bowels, approximating to a relaxed condition. It is a leading principle in medicine that if there is constipation or if the bowels move with difficulty, grave disorders result. How is a slight costive condition to be remedied ? If the patient is a youth, he should eat, every morning, salty foods well cooked and seasoned with olive oil, fish brine and salt, without bread. Or he should drink the liquid of boiled spinach or, St. John's bread, mixed with olive oil, fish brine and salt. An old man should drink, in the morning, honey diluted with warm water, and wait about four hours before taking his breakfast. This regimen should be observed for one day, or, if necessary, for three or four successive days till the bowels move freely."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.14","14. Another great principle of hygiene, physicians say, is as follows: As long as a person takes active exercise, works hard, does not over-eat and keeps his bowels open, he will be free from disease and will increase in vigour, even though the food he eats is coarse."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.15","15. But if one leads a sedentary life and does not take exercise, neglects the calls of nature, or is constipated—even if he eats wholesome food and takes care of himself in accordance with medical rules—he will, throughout his life, be subject to aches and pains and his strength will fail him. Over-eating is like a deadly poison to any constitution and is the principal cause of all diseases. Most maladies that afflict mankind result from bad food or are due to the patient filling his stomach with an excess of food that may even have been wholesome. Thus, Solomon, in his wisdom, said, ""He who keeps his mouth and tongue, keeps his soul from troubles."" (Prov. 21:23)—which text can be applied to the individual who guards his mouth from bad food and over-eating, and keeps his tongue from all speech except that which is necessary to obtain his needs."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.16","16. The correct procedure in bathing is to take a bath once a week. One should not step into the bath directly after a meal nor when hungry, but only after digestion has begun. The entire body should be bathed in water that is warm but not scalding. The head alone may be washed with water hot enough to scald the body. The body should then be washed in tepid water, then in lukewarm water, and so on, gradually reducing the temperature, till the water finally used is quite cold. Water, either lukewarm or cold, should not be poured upon the head. In the rainy season cold baths should not be taken. Nor should one rinse the body before it has perspired and become supple. Nor should one stay too long in the bath, but as soon as one perspires and the body has become supple, one should complete the ablutions and leave. Before and after bathing, attention should be paid to the excretory functions, as also before and after eating a meal, before and after sexual intercourse, before and after physical exercise, before going to bed and on rising. There are thus altogether ten occasions on which this rule should be followed."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.17","17. When one has come out of the bath, he should put on his clothes and cover his head in the outer chamber, so as to avoid catching cold. Even in summer, this precaution should be taken. After leaving the bath, a person should wait a while till he has recovered his composure, and his body is rested and cool. Then a meal may be taken. A little sleep, after leaving the bath and before the meal, is excellent. Cold water should not be drunk after bathing and certainly not while taking the bath. If, after the bath, one feels thirsty and cannot resist the desire to drink, the water should be mixed with wine or honey and then it may be drunk. During the winter, anointing the body with oil, after the final ablution, is beneficial."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.18","18. One should not accustom oneself to being frequently bled. Recourse to this procedure should only be had in case of special need. One should not be bled in summer or in winter, and only to a slight extent in the month of Nissan and Tishri. After the age of fifty, this treatment should be entirely discontinued. A person should not be bled and take a bath on the same day or set out on a journey on the same day; nor should one be bled on the day when he has returned from a journey. On the day when one is bled, less food and drink should be taken than usual. On that day, he should rest, avoid exertion and violent physical exercise, and not take part in sport."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.19","19. <i>Semen</i> constitutes the strength of the body, its life and the light of the eyes. Its emission to excess causes physical decay, debility and diminished vitality. Thus, Solomon, in his wisdom, said: ""Give not thy strength unto women"". (Prov. 31:3). Whosoever indulges in sexual dissipation becomes prematurely aged; his strength fails; his eyes become dim; a foul odour proceeds from his mouth and armpits; the hair of his head, eye-brows and eye-lashes drop our; the hair of his beard, armpits and legs grow abnormally; his teeth fall out; and besides these, he becomes subject to numerous other diseases. Medical authorities have stated that for each one who dies of other maladies, a thousand are the victims of sexual excess. A man should, therefore, be careful in this regard if he wishes to lead a happy life. He should only cohabit when he finds himself in good health and vigour, experiences involuntary erections which persist after he has diverted his mind to other things, is conscious of a heaviness from the loins downwards as if the spermatic cords were being drawn and his flesh is hot. Such a condition calls for cohabitation which then is conducive to health. One should not cohabit, when sated with food, nor when one is hungry but only after a meal has been digested. Before and after coition, attention should be paid to the excretory functions. Coition should not take place in a standing or sitting posture, nor in a bath house, nor on the day when one takes a bath or is bled, nor on the day when one sets out on a journey or has returned from a journey, nor on the day previous to any of such days or subsequent to them."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.20","20. Whoever lives in accordance with the directions I have set forth, has my assurance that he will never be sick till he grows old and dies; he will not be in need of a physician, and will enjoy normal health as long as he lives—unless his constitution be congenitally defective, or he has acquired bad habits from his early childhood, or if the world should be visited by pestilence or drought."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.21","21. All the useful rules here recommended are suitable to those who enjoy good health. But a person who is generally ailing or suffers from a local disorder, or has for several years been addicted to an evil habit, needs special treatment, according to the nature of his sickness—as is expounded in medical literature. ""Change of mode of living is the beginning of sickness""."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.22","22. In a place where there is no physician, both those that are well and those that are ailing should not diverge from the methods prescribed in this chapter. The observance of every one of them will yield beneficial results."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.23","23. No disciple of the wise may live in a city that is unprovided with the following ten officials and institutions, namely: a physician, a surgeon, a bath-house, a lavatory, a source of water supply such as a stream or a spring, a synagogue, a school teacher, a scribe, a treasurer of charity funds for the poor, a court that has authority to punish with stripes and imprisonment."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.1","1. Even as a sage is recognized by his wisdom and moral principles which distinguish him from the rest of the people, so ought he to be recognized in all his activities, in his food and drink, in the fulfillment of his marital obligations, in attention to his excretory functions, in his talk, walk, dress, management of his affairs and business transactions. All these activities should bear the mark of exceeding refinement and orderliness. For example, a scholar will not be a glutton but will eat food conducive to health; and of such food he will not eat to excess. He will not be eager to fill his stomach, like those who gorge themselves with food and drink till the body swells. Concerning such people, the Scripture saith, ""I will spread dung on your faces"" (Malachi 2:3). This text, our wise men say, refers to those who eat and drink and spend all their days as if they were holidays. They are the people who exclaim, ""Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die"". (Is. 22:13). This is how the wicked eat. They are reprobated in the verse, ""For all tables are full of filthy vomit, and no place is clean"" (Is. 28:8). The wise man, on the contrary, will only partake of one or two courses, of which he will consume as much as he needs to sustain him. Thus, Solomon said, ""The righteous eateth to satisfy himself"" (Prov. 13:25)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.2","2. When the wise man eats the modest meal that is proper for him, he will consume it nowhere else than at home, at his own table. Except in extreme emergencies, he will not eat in a restaurant or in the street, so as not to incur popular contempt. He will not accept invitations to take meals with unrefined people, nor will he sit down at tables that are not clean. He will not make it a practice to take his meal in all sorts of places, even in the company of scholars. He will not eat at banquets where there is a large crowd. It is indeed improper for a scholar to accept an invitation to any banquet unless it partakes of a religious character, as for example, on the occasion of a betrothal or a marriage, and then only when the bridegroom is a scholar, and the bride, a scholar's daughter. The righteous and saints in ancient times never ate anywhere but at home."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.3","3. When a sage drinks wine, he will only take enough to moisten the food which he has eaten. Any one who allows himself to become inebriated is a sinner and despicable, and loses his wisdom. If he becomes intoxicated in the presence of the ignorant, he has profaned the Name (of God). It is forbidden to drink wine at noon, in however small a quantity, unless it forms part of a meal; for, if it is then taken, it does not intoxicate. We have to be on our guard only in respect to wine drunk after the meal is over."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.4","4. Although connubial intercourse with one's wife is always permitted, still this relation too should be invested by the scholar with sanctity. He should not be always with his spouse, after the manner of a rooster, but should fulfill his marital obligation on Friday nights, if he is in a physically vigorous condition. Cohabitation should take place not at the beginning of the night when one is satiated and the stomach is full, nor towards the close of the night when one feels hungry, but at midnight, when the food is digested. He should not indulge in excessive frivolity, nor defile his mouth with lewd talk, even when he is alone with his wife. For the text, ""He declareth to a man what is his discourse"" (Amos 4:13), was interpreted by our sages traditionally to mean that ""a man will be called to account even for light conversation between him and his wife"". When cohabiting, neither husband nor wife should be in a state of intoxication, lethargy or melancholy. The wife should not be asleep at the time. The husband is not to force her, if she is unwilling. Coition should take place with the consent of both, and while they are full of desire and joyousness. The husband should converse and jest with his wife for a little while, so as to put her in a pleasant frame of mind and then cohabit modestly and not shamelessly. After the completion of the act, he should at once separate from her."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.5","5. Whoever observes this procedure not only hallows his soul, purifies his heart and refines his mind, but if he has children, they will be comely, modest, and disposed to wisdom and saintliness. One who follows the customs of the common people who walk in darkness, will have children like theirs."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.6","6. Extreme modesty is cultivated by scholars. They will not do aught that might expose them to contempt. They will not bare their heads or body. Even when responding to a call of nature, the scholar will behave decently; not bare himself till he sits down, nor dry himself with his right hand; he will withdraw from all people to the most private part of his dwelling or of a cave; or if he relieves himself behind a fence, he will withdraw to a distance so that others may not hear him. If he relieves himself in an open plain, he will go so far away that nobody can see his bare body. While relieving himself, he will not talk, even if there be great need. And as he conducts himself decently by day, so will he behave at night. One should get into the habit of relieving oneself in the morning and the evening, so as not to have to traverse long distances."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.7","7. A scholar, when speaking, will not shout or scream, like domestic cattle or wild beasts. He will not raise his voice unduly. His speech with all men will be gentle. But while speaking gently, he will be careful to avoid exaggeration which would make his speech sound affected, like the speech of the haughty. He will be the first to greet every one he meets, so that they will be well disposed towards him. He will judge every one favourably. He will dwell on the merits of others and never speak disparagingly of anybody. He loves peace and ensues it. If he feels that his words will be effective and heeded, he will speak; otherwise, he will remain silent. For instance, he will not attempt to appease his neighbour when the latter is exasperated, nor question him concerning his vows immediately after he has made them, but will wait till the man's mind has become cool and composed. He will not attempt to console the mourner while the dead still lies unburied; for till the body is interred, the mourner's mind is preoccupied. And thus he will behave in circumstances of a similar kind. He will not show himself in his neighbour's presence when that person is in disgrace, but will avoid meeting him. He will not deviate from the truth; neither add to it nor detract from it, except in the interest of peace or similar worthy aims. In short, he will limit his speech to topics of wisdom, benevolence, and the like. He will not enter into conversation with a woman on the street, not even with his wife, sister, or daughter."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.8","8. The scholar will not walk with proud mien and outstretched neck—attitudes condemned in the text ""They walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes"" (Is. 3:16). He will not walk mincingly and with short steps after the fashion of women and the haughty, as it is said ""Walking mincingly as they go and making a tinkling noise with their feet"" (Is. 3:16). He will not run in the street, after the manner of madmen, nor will he stoop, bent double like a hunchback, but will look towards the ground as one does when praying and will walk at the pace of a man busy with his affairs. A person's gait indicates whether he is wise and sensible or a foolish idiot. Thus Solomon, in his wisdom, said ""Yea also, when a fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he proclaimeth to every one that he is a fool"" (Eccles. 10:3); that is, by his behaviour he advertises himself as a fool."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.9","9. A scholar's dress will be becoming and clean. It is an offence for such a man if a stain or grease or the like is found on his garment. He should not put on robes befitting royalty, such as those embroidered with gold or purple, which attract universal attention; nor, on the other hand, shabby garments such as are worn by the poor, which bring contempt upon the wearer, but he will wear apparel suitable to the middle classes and that is neat. His flesh should not show under the clothing, as is the case with the extremely light linen fabrics manufactured in Egypt. His garments should not drag on the ground like those worn by the arrogant, but should only reach to the heels, while the sleeves may extend to the finger-tips. He should not let down his fringed garment—this being a mark of arrogance—except on Sabbaths, if he has no other change of garments. He should not, in summer, wear clouted shoes, with patch upon patch; but in winter, this is permitted if one is poor. He should not go forth into the street with his person or garments perfumed; nor should he apply perfume to his hair; but if he anoints his body with perfume, in order to remove unpleasant effluvium—this is permitted. So too, he should not go out at night alone, unless at the fixed hour when he has to attend a course of study. The object of all these rules is to save one from being suspected (of following evil courses)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.10","10. The scholar manages his affairs with judgment and prudence; spends on food, drink, and maintenance of his household, in accordance with his income and the state of his finances. He will not put himself to excessive trouble (to be considered wealthy). The wise men recommended in their rules for right living, that a man should not eat flesh meat, unless he longs for it, as it is said ""Because thy soul desireth to eat flesh"" (Deut. 12:20). For a healthy individual it is enough to eat meat once a week, on Friday evenings. But, if one is rich enough to eat meat every day, he may do so. The sages charged that a person should eat less than he can afford; dress in accordance with his means and as befits his station in life; and spend on his wife and children more than he can afford in order to secure respect for them."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.11","11. The sensible course is for a man first to choose an occupation that will give him a livelihood, then buy himself a home; and after that, take a wife; as it is said ""And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard and not redeemed it ?…. What man is there that has built a new house and hath not dedicated it ?…. and what man is there that hath betrothed a woman and not taken her?…. (Deut. 20:6-5-7). But the foolish first marry; then if one of this sort can afford it, he purchases a house; and, last of all, towards the end of his life, he sets about seeking a trade or lives on charity. Thus it is said in <i>the Imprecations,</i> ""A wife shalt thou betroth… a house shalt thou build… a vineyard shalt thou plant"" (Deut. 28:30); that is, all your activities shall be in the reverse order of what they should be, so that you will not prosper in your ways. And a blessing is conveyed in the Scriptural text ""And David had success in all his ways; and the Lord was with him"" (1. Sam. 18:14)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.12","12. A person is forbidden to declare all his property derelict or devote it to the sanctuary and thus become a public charge. He should not sell a field and buy a house with the proceeds; or sell a house and buy movables, or use the money in trade; but he may sell movables and buy a field. To sum up, he should make it his aim to employ his capital successfully (and convert the perishable into the durable<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Not in the M. S.; but in the printed editions, there is added a Hebrew phrase <span dir=""rtl"">ולׁהחלׁיף הכָלָׁה בקַײָם</span> which may be thus rendered.</i>); and not to snatch a little pleasure for a while, or gain a little enjoyment and thereby incur a great loss."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.13","13. The scholar conducts his business affairs honestly and in good faith. His nay is nay; his yea, yea. In his accounts, he is strict (in meeting his obligations). At the same time, when buying, he is liberal and does not drive a hard bargain. He pays promptly for his purchases. He declines to act as a surety or trustee; nor will he accept a power of attorney. In commercial matters, he acknowledges liability even where the law would not hold him liable; his principle being to keep his word and not change it. If others have been adjudged liable to him, he is considerate, and even forgives them the amount due. He grants benevolent<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* without interest.</i> loans and does favours. He will not encroach on another man's business, and throughout his life will not vex a human being. In short, he belongs to the class of those who are persecuted but do not persecute, who are reviled but do not revile. A man who acts thus is commended in the Scriptural text ""And He said unto me, thou art my servant, Israel, in whom I glory"" (Is. 49:3)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.1","1. It is natural to be influenced, in sentiments and conduct, by one's neighbours and associates, and observe the customs of one's fellow citizens. Hence, a person ought constantly to associate with the righteous and frequent the company of the wise, so as to learn from their practices, and shun the wicked who are benighted, so as not to be corrupted by their example. So Solomon saith ""He that walketh with the wise, shall be wise; but the companion of fools shall smart for it"" (Prov. 13:20). And it is also said ""Happy is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked"" (Psalms 1:1). So too, if one lives in a country where the customs are pernicious, and the inhabitants do not go in the right way, he should leave for a place where the people are righteous and follow the ways of the good. If all the countries of which he has personal knowledge, or concerning which he hears reports, fellow a course that is not right—as is the case in our times—or if military campaigns or sickness debar him from leaving for a country with good customs, he should live by himself in seclusion, as it is said, ""Let him sit alone and keep silence"" (Lam. 3:28). And if the inhabitants are wicked reprobates who will not let him stay in the country unless he mixes with them and adopts their evil practices, let him withdraw to caves, thickets or deserts, and not habituate himself to the ways of sinners, as it is said ""O that I were in the wilderness, in a lodging place of wayfaring men"" (Jerem. 9:1)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.2","2. It is an affirmative precept to attach oneself to sages and their disciples, so as to learn from their example; as it is said, ""And unto Him shalt thou cleave"" (Deut. 10:20). But can a human being cleave to the <i>Shechinah</i> ? Our wise men explained this text thus: ""Attach thyself to sages and their disciples"". A man should, accordingly, strive to win a scholar's daughter for a wife, and should give his daughter in marriage to a scholar. He should eat and drink in the company of scholars; give them opportunities to do business, and cultivate their society in every relation, as it is said ""And to cleave unto Him"" (Deut. 11:22). So too, our sages exorted us ""Sit in the dust of their feet, and drink their words thirstily"" (Ethics of the Fathers 1:4)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.3","3. It is incumbent on every one to love each individual Israelite as himself, as it is said ""Thou shalt love they neighbour, as thyself"" (Lev. 19:18). Hence, a person ought to speak in praise of his neighbour and be careful of his neighbour's property as he is careful of his own property and solicitous about his own honour. Whoever glorifies himself by humilitating another person, will have no portion in the world to come."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.4","4. To love the proselyte who comes to take refuge beneath the wings of the <i>Shechinah</i> is the fulfilment of two affirmative precepts. First, because he is included among neighbours (whom we are commanded to love) (Lev. 19:18). And secondly, because he is a stranger, and the Torah said ""Love ye therefore the stranger"" (Deut. 10:19). God charged (us) concerning the love of the stranger, even as He charged us concerning love of Himself, as it is said ""Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God"" (Deut. 6:5). The Holy One, blessed be He, loves strangers, as it is said ""And He loveth the stranger"" (Deut. 10:18)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.5","5. Whoever entertains in his heart hatred of any Israelite, transgresses a prohibition, as it is said ""Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart"" (Lev. 19:17). The violation of this precept is however not punished with stripes, as no overt act is involved. The Torah, in this text, only warned against hatred in the heart. But any one who smites or reviles his neighbour, although he is not permitted to do so, is not infringing the precept ""Thou shalt not hate thy brother""."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.6","6. When a man sins against another, the injured party should not hate the offender and keep silent, as it is said concerning the wicked ""And Absalom spake to Amnon neither good nor evil, for Absalom hated Amnon"" (2. Sam. 13:22). But it is his duty to inform the offender and say to him ""Why did you do this to me ? Why did you sin against me in this matter ?"" And thus it is said ""Thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour"" (Lev. 19:17). If the offender repents and pleads for forgiveness, he should be forgiven. The forgiver should not be obdurate, as it is said ""And Abraham prayed unto God"" (for Abimelech) (Gen. 20:17)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.7","7. If one observes that a person committed a sin or walks in a way that is not good, it is a duty to bring the erring man back to the right path and point out to him that he is wronging himself by his evil courses, as it is said ""Thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour"" (Lev. 19:17). He who rebukes another, whether for offences against the rebuker himself or for sins against God, should administer the rebuke in private, speak to the offender gently and tenderly, and point out that he is only speaking for the wrongdoer's own good, to secure for him life in the world to come. If the latter accepts the rebuke, well and good. If not, he should be rebuked a second, and a third time. And so one is bound to continue the admonitions, till the sinner assaults the admonisher and says to him ""I refuse to listen"". Whoever is in a position to prevent wrongdoing and does not do so, is responsible for the iniquity of all the wrongdoers whom he might have checked."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.8","8. He who rebukes another must not at first speak to the offender harshly so as to put him to shame, as it is said ""And thou shalt not suffer sin because of him"" (Lev. 19:17). Our Rabbis explained this text as follows: ""Since it might have been supposed that you are to rebuke the sinner till he changes colour, therefore it is said ""And thou shalt not bear sin because of him"". Hence, the inference that it is forbidden to put an Israelite to shame, especially in public. Although one who puts another to shame is not punished with stripes, still it is a grave offence. And thus the sages said, ""He who shames another in public has no portion in the world to come"". One ought therefore to beware of publicly shaming anyone, whether he be young or old. One should not call a person by a name of which he feels ashamed, nor relate anything in his presence which humiliates him. This applies to matters between man and man. But in regard to duties to God, if an individual, after having been privately rebuked, does not repent, he should be shamed in public; his sin should be openly declared; he is to be reviled, affronted and cursed till he returns to the right course. This was the method followed by all the prophets of Israel."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.9","9. If one who has been wronged by another, does not wish to rebuke or speak to the offender because the latter is a very common person or mentally defective, and if he has sincerely forgiven him, and neither bears him ill-will nor rebukes him—he acts according to the standard of saints. All that the Torah objects to is harbouring ill-will."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.10","10. A man ought to be especially heedful of his behaviour towards widows and orphans, for their souls are exceedingly depressed and their spirits low. Even if they are wealthy, even if they are the widow and orphans of a king, we are specifically enjoined concerning them, as it is said ""Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child"" (Ex. 22:21). How are we to conduct ourselves towards them? One must not speak to them otherwise than tenderly. One must show them unvarying courtesy; not hurt them physically with hard toil, nor wound their feelings with harsh speech. One must take greater care of their property than of one's own. Whoever irritates them, provokes them to anger, pains them, tyrranizes over them, or causes them loss of money, is guilty of a transgression, and still more so, if one beats them or curses them. Though no stripes are inflicted for this transgression, its punishment is explicitly set forth in the Torah (in the following terms) ""My wrath shall wax hot, and I will slay you with the sword"" (Ex. 22:23). He who created the world by His word made a covenant with widows and orphans that when they will cry out because of violence, they will be answered; as it is said, ""If thou afflict them in any wise—for if they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry"" (Ex. 22:22). This only applies to cases where a person afflicts them for his own ends. But if a teacher punishes orphan children in order to teach them Torah or a trade, or lead them in the right way—this is permissible. And yet he should not treat them like others but make a distinction in their favour. He should guide them gently, with the utmost tenderness and courtesy, whether they are bereft of a father or mother, as it is said ""For the Lord will plead their cause"" (Prov. 22:23). To what age are they to be regarded in these respects as orphans ? Till they reach the age when they no longer need an adult on whom they depend to train them and care for them, and when each of them can provide for all his wants, like other grown-up persons."

Whoever tells tales about another person violates a prohibition, as it is said ""Thou shalt not go up and down as a tale-bearer among thy people"" (Lev. 19:16). And although no stripes are inflicted, it is a grave offence, and leads to the death of many souls in Israel. Hence, this precept is followed immediately by the sentence ""Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbour"" (Lev. 19:16). For an example of the tragic consequence of this transgression, read what happened after Doeg's report concerning the priests of Nob. (I. Sam. 22:6-19)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.7.2","2. Who is a tale-bearer ? One who carries reports, and goes about from one person to another and says ""So-and-so said this""; ""Such and such a statement have I heard about so-and so"". Even if what he says or repeats may be true, the tale-bearer ruins the world. There is a still graver offence that comes within this prohibition, namely, the evil tongue.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* A person with an evil tongue is the habitual scandal-monger.</i> This means talking disparagingly of anyone, even though what one says is true; but he who utters falsehood is called a slanderer. A person with an evil tongue is one who, sitting in company, says ""That person did such a thing""; ""So and so's ancestors were so and so""; ""I have heard this about him""; and then proceeds to talk scandal. Of such a person, Scripture says ""May the Lord cut off all smooth lips, the tongue that speaketh proud things"". (Ps. 12:4)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.7.3","3. The sages say ""There are three offences for which one is punished in this world and forfeits his portion in the world to come. These are idolatry, incest and murder; but the evil tongue is equal to all the three put together"". The sages further said ""To indulge in evil speech is like a denial of the fundamental principle of religion, as it is said ""Who said 'our tongue will we make mighty; our lips are with us; who is lord over us ?' "" (Ps. 12:5). The sages also said ""The evil tongue slays three persons: the utterer of evil, the listener, the one spoken about; and the listener will be punished worse than the speaker""."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.7.4","4. There are modes of speech that may be styled ""dust of the evil tongue"". Such are remarks like the following: ""Who would have thought of so-and-so that he would be as he is now.<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** <i>Or,</i> ""who can say of so-and-so that he will always be as he is now.""</i> Or ""be silent about so-and-so. I do not wish to tell what happened, etc."" To speak in a person's favour in the presence of his enemies, savours of the evil tongue. For it will provoke them to speak of him disparagingly. Referring to this, Solomon said ""He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse unto him"" (Prov. 27:14). For out of what had been said to his good, proceedeth evil. Such too is the case of one who indulges in evil speech jokingly and frivolously, and not out of hatred. And so, Solomon, in his wisdom, says ""As one who mockingly casteth firebrands, arrows and death, and saith, am I not jesting?"" (Prov. 26:18). Equally reprehensible is one who indulges in evil speech deceitfully, that is, speaks as it were in all innocence, as if unaware that what he says is an evil utterance, and when a protest is made, replies, ""I do not know that this is evil speech, or that such is the conduct of so-and-so""."

Whether one indulges in evil speech about a person in his presence, or in his absence, or makes statements which, if repeated, would tend to hurt him physically or injure him financially, distress or alarm him—all this is evil speech. If a statement of this character had been made in the presence of three persons, the subject matter is regarded as public and generally known, and if one of the three repeats it, he is not guilty of evil speech, provided he had no intention to give the story wider currency."

"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.7.7","7. He who takes revenge, violates a prohibition, and it is said ""Thou shalt not take vengeance"" (Lev. 19:18). And although he is not punished with stripes, still such conduct indicates an exceedingly bad disposition. One should rather practise forbearance in all secular matters. For the intelligent realise that these are vain things and not worth taking vengeance for. What is ""taking vengeance""? The following is a case. A neighbour says to one, ""Lend me your axe"". He replies ""I will not lend it to you"". The next day, the latter needs a similar favour from the neighbour and says to him ""Lend me <i>your</i> axe"", and receives the reply ""I will not lend it to you, for you did not lend me your axe when I asked it of you"". Any one who acts in this way is ""taking vengeance."" But when he comes to borrow aught, one should give what is asked cheerfully, and not repay discourtesy with discourtesy. And so in similar cases. Thus David, expressing his excellent sentiments, said ""If I have requited him that did evil unto me, or despoiled mine adversary"" …(Ps. 7:5)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.7.8","8. So too, one who bears a grudge against a fellow-Israelite violates a prohibition, as it is said, ""Nor bear a grudge against the children of thy people"" (Lev. 19:18). What is ""bearing a grudge ?"" A said to B, ""Let this house to me, or let me borrow this ox"". B refuses. After a time, B comes to A to borrow or hire something. A replies ""Here it is. I lend it to you. I am not like you. I will not treat you as you treated me"". One who acts thus, transgresses the commandment ""Thou shalt not bear a grudge"". One should blot the thing out of his mind and not bear a grudge. For as long as one nurses a grievance and keeps it in mind, one may come to take vengeance. The Torah, accordingly, emphatically warns us not to bear a grudge, so that the impression of the wrong shall be quite obliterated and be no longer remembered. This is the right principle. It alone makes civilized life and social intercourse possible."

"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.1.1","1. In the days of Enosh, the people fell into gross error, and the counsel of the wise men of the generation became foolish. Enosh himself was among those who erred. Their error was as follows: ""Since God"", they said, ""created these stars and spheres to guide the world, set them on high and allotted unto them honour, and since they are ministers who minister before Him, they deserve to be praised and glorified, and honour should be rendered them; and it is the will of God, blessed be He, that men should aggrandise and honour those whom He aggrandised and honoured—just as a king desires that respect should be shown to the officers who stand before Him, and thus honour is shown to the king."" When this idea arose in their minds, they began to erect temples to the stars, offered up sacrifices to them, praised and glorified them in speech, and prostrated themselves before them—their purpose, according to their perverse notions, being to obtain the Creator's favour. This was the root of idolatry, and this was what the idolaters, who knew its fundamentals, said. They did not however maintain that there was no God except the particular star (which was the object of their worship). Thus Jeremiah said ""Who would not fear thee, O king of nations ? For it befitteth Thee; for as much as among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdom, there is none like unto Thee. But in one thing they are brutish and foolish. The vanities by which they are instructed are but a stock"" (Jerem. 10:7-8). This means that all know that Thou alone art God; their error and folly consists in imagining that this vain worship is Thy desire."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.1.2","2. In course of time, there arose among men false prophets who asserted that God had commanded and expressly told them, ""Worship that particular star, or worship all the stars. Offer up to it such and such sacrifices. Pour out to it such and such libations. Erect a temple to it. Make a figure of it, to which all the people—the women, children, and the rest of the folk—shall bow down"". The false prophet pointed out to them the figure which he had invented out of his own mind, and asserted that it is the figure of that particular star, which had been shown him in his prophetic vision. And then, they began to make figures in temples, under the trees, on the mountain-tops and the hills. There they would assemble, bow down to the figures, and tell all the people that this particular figure conferred benefits and inflicted injuries, and that it was proper to worship and fear it. Their priests would say to them, ""Through this worship, shall ye increase and prosper. Do this, and do not do that"". Other imposters then sprang up, who declared that the star, celestial sphere or angel, had communed with them, and said to them ""Worship me in such and such fashion"", had taught them a definite ritual and said to them ""Do this, and do not do that"". So gradually the custom spread throughout the world of worshipping figures with various modes of worship, such as offering up sacrifices to them, and bowing down to them. As time passed, the honoured and revered Name of God was forgotten by mankind, vanished from their lips and hearts, and was no longer known to them. All the common people and the women and children knew only the figure of wood and stone, and the temple edifice in which they had, from their childhood, been trained to prostrate themselves to the figure, worship it and swear by its name. Even their wise men, such as priests and men of similar standing, also fancied that there was no other god but the stars and spheres, for whose sake and in whose similitude these figures had been made. But The Creator of the Universe was known to none, and recognised by none, save a few solitary individuals, such as Enosh, Methuselah, Noah, Shem and Eber. The world moved on in this fashion, till that Pillar of the World, the Patriarch Abraham, was born. After he was weaned, while still an infant, his mind began to reflect. By day and by night he was thinking and wondering: 'How is it possible that this (celestial) sphere should continuously be guiding the world and have no one to guide it and cause it to turn round; for it cannot be that it turns round of itself'. He had no teacher, no one to instruct him in aught. He was submerged, in Ur of the Chaldees, among silly idolaters. His father and mother and the entire population worshipped idols, and he worshipped with them. But his mind was busily working and reflecting till he had attained the way of truth, apprehended the correct line of thought and knew that there is One God, that He guides the celestial Sphere and created everything, and that among all that exist, there is no god beside Him. He realised that the whole world was in error, and that what had occasioned their error was that they worshipped the stars and the images, so that the truth perished from their minds. Abraham was forty years old when he recognised his Creator. Having attained this knowledge, he began to refute the inhabitants of Ur of the Chaldees, arguing with them and saying to them, ""The course you are following is not the way of truth"". He broke the images and commenced to instruct the people that it was not right to serve any one but the God of the Universe, to Whom alone it was proper to bow down, offer up sacrifices and make libations, so that all human creatures might, in the future, know Him; and that it was proper to destroy and shatter all the images, so that the people might not err like these who thought that there was no god but these images. When he had prevailed over them with his arguments, the king (of the country) sought to slay him. He was miraculously saved, and emigrated to Haran. He then began to proclaim to the whole world with great power and to instruct the people that the entire Universe had but one Creator and that Him it was right to worship. He went from city to city and from kingdom to kingdom, calling and gathering together the inhabitants till he arrived in the land of Canaan. There too, he proclaimed his message, as it is said ""And he called there on the name of the Lord, God of the Universe"" (Gen. 21:33). When the people flocked to him and questioned him regarding his assertions, he would instruct each one according to his capacity till he had brought him to the way of truth, and thus thousands and tens of thousands joined him. These were the persons referred to in the phrase, ""men of the house of Abraham"". He implanted in their hearts this great doctrine, composed books on it, and taught it to Isaac, his son. Isaac settled down, instructing and exhorting. He imparted the doctrine to Jacob and ordained him to teach it. He, too, settled down, taught and morally strengthened all who joined him. The patriarch Jacob instructed all his sons, set apart Levi, appointed him head (teacher) and placed him in a college to teach the way of God and keep the charge of Abraham. He charged his sons to appoint from the tribe of Levi, one instructor after another, in uninterrupted succession, so that the doctrine might never be forgotten. And so it went on with ever increasing vigour among Jacob's children and their adherents till they became a people that knew God. When the Israelites had stayed a long while in Egypt, they relapsed, learnt the practices of their neighbours, and, like them, worshipped idols, with the exception of the tribe of Levi, which steadfastly kept the charge of the Patriarch. This tribe of Levi never practised idolatry. The doctrine implanted by Abraham would, in a very short time, have been uprooted, and Jacob's descendants would have relapsed into the error and perversities universally prevalent. But because of God's love for us and because He kept the oath made to our ancestor Abraham, He appointed Moses to be our teacher and the teacher of all the prophets, and charged him with his mission. After Moses had begun to exercise his prophetic functions and Israel had been chosen by the Almighty as His heritage, he crowned them with precepts, and showed them the way to worship Him and how to deal with idolatry and with those who go astray after it."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.1","1. The essential principle in the precepts concerning idolatry is that we are not to worship any thing created—neither angel, sphere, star, none of the four elements, nor whatever has been formed from them. Even if the worshipper is aware that the Eternal is God, and worships the created thing in the sense in which Enosh and his contemporaries did, he is an idolater. It is against this that the Torah warns us when it says ""And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and seest the sun…. which the Lord, thy God hath alloted unto all the peoples"" (Deut. 4:19). This means that when your mind roams and you observe that the world is guided by these spheres and that God placed them in the world, as beings that live, endure permanently, and do not disintegrate, like all other things, you may say that it is proper to bow down to these spheres and worship them. Concerning this tendency, God commanded and said, ""Take heed lest your heart be deceived"" (Deut. 11:16); that is to say, do not be led astray by the fancies of your mind, to worship these beings as intermediaries between yourselves and the Creator."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.2","2. Many volumes have been composed by idolaters on idolatry, dealing with its essential principle, rites and rules. The Holy One, blessed be He, has enjoined us not to read these books, nor to meditate upon idol-worship, nor upon anything appertaining to it. It is even forbidden to gaze upon the picture of an idolatrous figure, as it is said ""Turn ye not unto the idols"" (Lev. 19:4). In this connection it is further said ""And that thou inquirest not after their gods, saying 'How do these nations serve'"" (Deut. 12:30). That means that you shall not enquire in regard to an idol, as to the mode of its worship, even if you are not worshipping it. For this would cause you to turn after it and do as the idolaters do, as the text continues ""Even so will I do likewise"" (Deut. 12:30)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.3","3. All these prohibitions come under one category—not to turn to idolatry. Whoever turns towards it, by an overt act, is punished with stripes. It is not only idolatry to which we must not turn in thought. We are likewise warned not to permit any thought to enter our minds, that might cause one to reject a fundamental principle of the Torah. We must not turn our minds to such a thought and thus be drawn after the imaginations of our hearts. For the mind is limited; not every mind is capable of attaining knowledge of the truth in its purity. If every man were to follow after the vagaries of his heart, the result would be universal ruin, ensuing from the limitations of the human intellect. How so ? Sometimes one will be drawn to idolatry. Sometimes he will waver in his mind concerning the Unity of God, as to whether He is One or He is not One. He will speculate on what is above (the visible universe), what below it, what existed before the Creation, what will exist after the world comes to an end. Sometimes he will muse concerning Prophecy, and say to himself 'Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is not'. Sometimes he will harbour similar doubts concerning the Torah as to whether it is of divine origin, or not. And such a person, being ignorant of the logical principles which need to be applied in order to attain positive truth, will lapse into heresy. In this regard, the Torah exhorted us ""And that ye go not about after your heart nor after your eyes, after which ye use to go astray"" (Num. 15:39). This means ""You shall not allow yourselves to be drawn, each one after his own limited intelligence, and imagine that his mind is attaining truth."" The sages thus explained the text quoted above (Num. 15:39); ""After your heart"" refers to heresy. ""After your eyes"" refers to lechery."" Although the violation of this prohibition may result in forfeiture of life hereafter, it is not punished with stripes. This is in accordance with the principle that an infraction which does not involve a physical act does not render one liable to that penalty."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.4","4. The precept relating to idolatry is equal in importance to all the other precepts put together, as it is said, ""And when ye shall err and not observe all these commandments"" (Num. 15:22). This text has traditionally been interpreted as alluding to idolatry; hence the inference that acceptance of idolatry is tantamount to repudiating the whole Torah, the prophets and everything that they were commanded, from Adam to the end of time, as it is said ""From the day that the Lord gave commandment and onward, throughout your generations"" (Num. 15:23). And whoever denies idolatry confesses his faith in the whole Torah, in all the prophets and all that the prophets were commanded, from Adam to the end of time. And this is the fundamental principle of all the commandments."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.5","5. An Israelite who worshipped an idol is regarded as an idolater in all respects and not as an Israelite who committed a transgression, the penalty for which is death by stoning. A pervert to idolatry is regarded as having renounced the whole of the Torah. So too, the infidels in Israel are in no wise to be regarded as Israelites; as it is said, ""None that go unto her return, neither do they attain the paths of life"" (Prov. 2:19). Infidels are those who, in respect to the follies of which we have spoken, go after the fancies of their hearts, till at last they become transgressors of the fundamental precepts of the Torah, in a spirit of defiance and arrogance, asserting that there is nothing wrong in what they do. It is forbidden to hold converse with them or give them any reply, as it is said, ""And come not nigh the door of her house"" (Prov. 5:8). The mind of the infidel tends towards idolatry."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.6","6. Whoever acknowledges that idolatry is true, even if he does not worship an idol, reviles and blasphemes the honoured and revered Name of God. The idolater and the blasphemer are in the same class, as it is said, ""But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a stranger, the same blasphemeth the Lord"" (Num. 15:30). Hence, the idolater is hanged, just as the blasphemer is hanged, both being previously stoned. I have accordingly included the law of the blasphemer among the laws of idolatry, since both the blasphemer and the idolater deny the fundamental principles of our religion."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.7","7. The following are the rules concerning the blasphemer. The blasphemer does not incur the penalty of death by stoning till he has pronounced the proper Name of God which is written <i>Aleph, Daleth Nun, Yod,</i> and cursed it, invoking one of the names of the Deity that may not be erased, as it is said ""And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord (shall be put to death) (Lev. 24:16). Blaspheming the Proper Name of God is punished by stoning; but one who blasphemes any of the attributive names of God, only violates a prohibition. One authority declares that the extreme penalty is incurred only when the Tetragrammaton (J.H.V.H.) is blasphemed. I am of the opinion that the blasphemer is stoned, who uses either of the Proper Names."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.8","8. Whence is the prohibition of blasphemy derived ? From the text ""Thou shalt not revile God"" (Ex. 22:27). The witnesses are examined day after day, using allusive terms such as the phrase ""Let José smite José"". When the trial is concluded, the Court is cleared and the senior witness is again questioned. The judges say to him 'declare what thou didst hear, explicitly'. He makes the declaration. The judges rise and rend their garments; these rents are never sewn up. The second witness then says 'I heard the same as he did'. If there were many witnesses, each of them has to declare, 'I heard the same as the previous witness'."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.9","9. If the blasphemer retracts the blasphemy, even immediately after it has been uttered, it is of no avail. One who blasphemed in the presence of witnesses is put to death by stoning. If one blasphemed the Name of God, invoking the name of an idol, zealots attack him and put him to death. If they have not slain him, and he appears before the Court, he is not stoned unless he has blasphemed, invoking one of the Proper Names of God."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.2.10","10. Whoever hears the Name of God blasphemed—even if it be one of the attributive Names—must rend his garments, provided that he hears the blasphemy uttered by an Israelite. Whether he hears it directly from the blasphemer, himself, or hears it reported by one who heard it from the blasphemer, he has to rend his garments. But one who hears a blasphemy uttered by an idolater is not obliged to rend his garments. The reason why Eliakim and Shebna rent their garments (when they heard Rabshakeh blaspheming) (II Kings ch. 18), was because Rabshakeh was an apostate. All the witnesses and judges place their hands, one after another, upon the head of the blasphemer and say to him 'Thy blood be upon thy head, for thou hast brought it on thyself'. Of all those, who are condemned to death by the Court, the blasphemer is the only one in whose case imposition of hands is required, as it is said, ""And let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head"" (Lev. 24:14)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.1","1. Whoever worships an idol of his own free will and wilfully, incurs the (divine) penalty of excision. If witnesses were present and there had been previous warning, he is stoned. If one worshipped an idol in error, he brings the prescribed sin-offering."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.2","2. Several modes of worship were instituted by the idolaters for each image and figure. The mode of worship for one idol is not the same as that for another idol. For example, the worship of Peor consists in indecent exposure of the person before the idol; the worship of Mercury consists in casting stones towards the idol or removing stones from before it. Many modes of worship, similar to these, were instituted for other idols. Hence, he who exposes his person in worship of Mercury or casts a stone before Peor, does not incur the penalty for idolatry. He is only liable, if he worships an idol in accordance with its special ritual, as it is said, ""How do these nations serve their gods ? Even so will I do likewise"" (Deut. 12:30). The Court must therefore be acquainted with the diverse idolatrous rituals, for no Israelite, (charged with worshipping an idol), is stoned, unless the Court knows that he observed the ritual appropriate to that idol."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.3","3. The prohibition of these and similar modes of worship is inferred from the text ""Nor serve them"" (Ex. 20:5). This refers to all modes of worship with the exception of bowing down, sacrificing, offering incense or libation. He who uses any of these modes in the worship of any idol is liable to the penalty for idolatry, even if such is not the mode of worship peculiar to the particular idol worshipped. For example, if one pours forth a libation to Peor, or sacrifices to Mercury, he is liable, as it is said ""He that sacrificeth unto the gods, save unto the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed"" (Ex. 22:19). Since sacrifice is included in the modes of worship, why is it especially mentioned in this text? To indicate that even as sacrifice is a mode of worship appropriate to the service of God, and one who offers up sacrifices to another deity incurs the penalty of stoning, irrespective of whether sacrifice is or is not the special mode of worshipping that particular deity, so every mode of worship appropriate to the service of God, if used in the worship of an idol,—whether that is or is not its special mode or worship—renders the worshipper liable as an idolater. It is therefore said, ""Thou shalt not bow down to another god"" (Ex. 34:14), in order to render one who bows down to an idol liable, even if such an act is not its mode of worship. The same rule applies to the offering of incense or libation. Sprinkling (of blood) and Pouring out Libations are regarded as identical."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.4","4. If one offers ordure to an idol, or makes a libation to it of a pot filled with urine, he is liable to the penalty for idolatry. One who slays a grasshopper (to an idol) is not liable, unless such is its mode of worship. Thus also, to slay a beast that is short of a limb (as a sacrifice to an idol), does not render the slayer liable unless this was its special mode of worship. If an idol is worshipped by means of a stick, one who broke a stick before it, is liable and the stick may not be used. But if one threw a stick before it, he is liable, but the stick is not inhibited from use. The reason for the distinction is that throwing a stick is not analogous to sprinkling blood; because the stick, after being thrown, is unimpaired, while the blood, after it had been sprinkled, has been dispersed. Whoever accepts any one of the various classes of idols as a god, incurs the penalty of stoning. Even if a man takes up a brick and addresses it thus: 'Thou art my god', or words of similar import, he is liable. And though he retracts immediately and adds 'This is not my god', his retraction is of no avail and he is stoned."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.5","5. Whoever worships an idol in accordance with its special ritual, even if he does so contemptuously, is liable. For example, if one exposes his person before Peor, in order to show contempt for it, or casts a stone towards Mercury to show his contempt for it, he is liable—these being the respective modes of worshipping those idols—and he should accordingly bring a sacrifice in atonement for his error."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.6","6. If one worships an idol, out of love, as for instance, if a particular image fills him with delight by its beautiful craftmanship, or, if one worships an idol, out of fear of it, because he apprehends that it might do him harm—like the idolaters who imagine that the idol has power to benefit or injure—he is liable to stoning, provided that he accepted it as a god. But if he worshipped it with the ritual peculiar to it, or with one of the four modes appropriate to the worship of God, and his motive is only love of the idol or fear of it, he is not liable. He who embraces an idol, kisses it, sweeps the ground or lays the dust in front of it, washes it, anoints it, clothes it, puts shoes on its feet, or performs similar offices of respect, violates a prohibition, for it is said, ""Nor serve them"" (Ex. 20:5). These acts come under the category of worship, but stripes are not inflicted for any of them, since they do not constitute worship explicitly. If any of these acts is a ritual peculiar to an idol, and one performs it with intent to worship, he is liable for idolatry."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.7","7. If a thorn lodged in a person's foot while he was standing in front of an idol, he is not to bend down in order to remove it, because it would look as if he were bowing down to the idol. If coins, belonging to a person, had been scattered in front of it, he is not to bend down to pick them up, because it would look as if he were bowing down to the idol. But he is to sit down and then extract the thorn or pick up the coins."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.8","8. Where there are figures in front of an idol, which discharge water, one may not place his mouth over the opening of any of them and drink, because it would look as if he were kissing an idol."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.9","9. If one acquires an idol for himself, he is punished with stripes, even though he did not make it with his own hand and did not worship it, as it is said, ""Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image nor any manner of likeness"" (Ex. 20:4). So too, if one makes an idol with his hands for others, even if he makes it for an idolater, he is punished with stripes, as it is said, ""Nor make unto yourselves molten gods"" (Lev. 19:4). Hence, one who makes an idol with his own hand and for himself, is punished with stripes twice."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.3.10","10. It is forbidden to make figures for purposes of ornament, even if they are not idolatrous, as it is said, ""Ye shall not make with Me gods of gold and silver"" (Ex. 20:23); that is to say, figures of gold and silver which only serve as ornaments; so that those likely to err shall not err and imagine that these figures serve idolatrous purposes. The prohibition of making ornamental figures only applies to representation of the human form. Hence, a figure of a human being must not be made in wood, clay or stone; provided that the figure is in high relief like sculptures and figures in palaces and the like places; and whoever makes such is punished with stripes. But if a figure is in bas-relief or painted, such as pictures on boards and tablets, or woven in tapestry—it is permitted."

If a signet ring has a human figure on it, and the figure is in high-relief, it is forbidden to wear the ring, but it may be used as a seal. If the figure is in bas-relief, the ring may be worn but may not be used for sealing, because the impression it would make would be in high-relief. It is also forbidden to make figures of the sun, moon, stars, constellations, or angels, for it is said, ""Ye shall not make with Me"" (Ex. 20:20); that is, 'ye shall not make figures representing My ministers that minister before Me on high'; and such figures may not be made even on tablets. Figures of quadrupeds and of other animals—with the exception of Man,—and of trees and plants, etc., may be made, even if the figures are in relief."

Those who seduce a city of Israel to idolatry are put to death by stoning, even if they themselves did not worship an idol but only seduced the inhabitants of their city to do so.

From the text ""Neither let it be heard out of thy mouth (Ex. 23:13)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.2","2. A city does not become a seduced city unless those who have led it astray belong to it and are of the same tribe as the rest of its inhabitants, as it is said, ""From the midst of thee, and they have drawn away the inhabitants of their city"" (Deut. 13:14); unless the seducers are two or more than two, as it is said ""Certain base <i>fellows</i> are gone out…. and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city"" (ibid 13:14); and unless those seduced are the majority of its inhabitants and number from one hundred up to the majority of the tribe. But if the majority of a tribe has been led astray, they are judged individually, as it is said, ""the inhabitants of that city"" (Deut. 13:16), that is, not of a small village nor of a large capital. A population of less than a hundred forms a small village and the majority of a tribe constitutes a large capital. So too, if women or children have seduced it, or a single male adult has done so, or a minority only of its inhabitants have been led astray, or if they have gone astray of themselves, or the seducers came from outside—in all these cases, the law of the seduced city is not applied to it; the inhabitants are regarded as individuals who have worshipped idolatry.

None of the Cities of Refuge (Num. 35:10-15), can ever become a seduced city, as it is said, ""in one of thy cities"" (Deut. 13:13). Nor can Jerusalem be condemned as a seduced city, since it had never been assigned to (any of) the tribes. A frontier town is never condemned as a seduced city, so that idolaters might not invade the Holy Land of Israel and destroy it. One court cannot declare three cities, adjacent to each other, to be seduced cities. But it may so declare them if they are at a distance from each other."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.5","5. A city is not declared a seduced city unless the seducers used the plural number and said to the inhabitants 'let us go and worship', 'let us go and sacrifice', 'let us go and pour out libations', 'let us go and bow down', or 'let us go and accept the idol as a god'; and the people gave heed and worshipped it with its special ritual; or in one of the four modes appropriate to the worship of God, or accepted the idol as a god. In a city where all these conditions have not been fulfilled by it and its seducers, how are the inhabitants to be treated ? Those who have worshipped idols are to be warned separately, and after testimony has been given of their persisting in idolatry, they are put to death by stoning as individuals who worshipped idols. Their property passes to their heirs."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.6","6. What is the procedure in the case of a seduced city, when it is in a condition to be declared a seduced city ? The Supreme Court sends a Commission, through whom it institutes an enquiry and inquisition, till the Judges are convinced on clear evidence that all or the greater part of that city's population have been led astray and relapsed into idolatry. Then they send to them two scholars to warn them and try to bring them back to the right path. If they repent, it is well. But if they persist in their folly, the Court charges all Israel to organise an expedition against them. They lay siege to, and wage war upon them till the city is taken by storm. After it has been taken, a large number of tribunals is set up to try the inhabitants. Any one against whom two witnesses come and testify that he worshipped idols, after having been warned, is set apart. If all who worshipped idols are found to be a minority of the inhabitants, they are stoned, and the rest are saved. If those who worshipped idols are found to be the majority, they are brought before the Supreme Court, where their trial is completed. All those who worshipped idols are put to death by decapitation. If it is found that all the inhabitants had worshipped idols, all human beings in the city, including women and children, are put to the sword. If a majority of the inhabitants had worshipped idols, the wives and children of the idolaters are slain with the sword. Whether the whole city or a majority of its inhabitants had been seduced, those who seduced them are put to death by stoning. All the property in the city is gathered into its broadway. If it has no broadway, a broadway is constructed for it. If its broadway is situated outside the city, an exterior wall is built, so as to enclose it within the city, as it is said, ""into the midst of the broad place thereof"" (Deut. 13:17). All living creatures in the city are slain and all other property, together with the district itself, is burnt. This destruction by fire is an affirmative precept, as it is said, ""And thou shalt burn with fire the city and all the spoil thereof"" (Deut. 13:17)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.7","7. Property belonging to the righteous men in the city, that is, those inhabitants who were not led astray with the majority, is burnt with the rest of the goods in the city; because they lived there, their property is destroyed. Whoever converts any portion of it, however small, to his use, is punished with the statutory (39) stripes; as it is said ""And there shall cleave naught of the devoted thing to thy hand"" (Deut. 13:18)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.8","8. If the witnesses, on whose evidence a city has been declared a seduced city, are found to have given false testimony, one who has taken possession of any portion of its property acquires the right to the same, and may convert it to his use—the reason being that the witnesses' testimony was refuted.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* And therefore the property need not be destroyed (as in paragraphs 6 and 7).</i> Why, however, did he acquire the right to the property ? The answer is that every owner of property in that city, immediately after conviction, divested himself of his ownership, by dereliction. The city is never rebuilt, and whoever rebuilds it, is punished with stripes, as it is said ""It shall not again be built"" (Deut. 13:17). But the site may be converted into gardens and parks, as it is said ""It shall not be built again""—which means that it may not be rebuilt as an inhabited district, such as it formerly had been."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.9","9. When a caravan, travelling from place to place, passed through a city that had been seduced and was also seduced with it, the members of the caravan are put to death by decapitation and their property is destroyed—provided that the caravan stayed in the city at least thirty days. Otherwise, they are put to death by stoning, and their property passes to their heirs."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.10","10. Property belonging to residents in another district, but deposited in the seduced city—even when responsibility for its safekeeping was assumed by citizens of the condemned city—is not burnt but reverts to the owners, as it is said, ""The spoil thereof"" (Deut. 13:17)—not the spoil of another district. Property owned by the wicked who were seduced, and which was deposited in another district, if it had been collected and placed with the property in the condemned city, is burnt with it. Otherwise it is not destroyed but passes to the heirs."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.11","11. A beast, half interest in which belongs to a seduced city (or a resident in it), while the other half is the property of another city, if found in the seduced city, may not be converted to private use. A mass of dough, similarly owned, may be used, because it is capable of partition."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.12","12. A beast owned by a seduced city, even after it had been ritually slaughtered, may not be converted to private use, as is the rule with an ox condemned to be stoned (Ex. 21:28-32) that had been ritually slaughtered. Natural hair of the men or women of the seduced city may be used. But the hair of a wig found there, comes within the category of ""the spoil thereof"" and may not be used."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.13","13. Fruits (of the field or orchard), not yet severed and found in the seduced city, may be enjoyed, as it is said, ""And thou shalt gather…. and shalt burn"" (Deut. 13:17). The text refers to that which only needs to be gathered and burnt, but not to fruits still attached (to the soil or tree), for these must be severed before they can be gathered and burnt. The same principle applies to the hair of the head, and, needless to add, to trees which are permitted to be used and become the property of the heirs. In regard to sanctified property, cattle set apart to be sacrificed on the altar are suffered to die a natural death, for ""the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination"" (Prov. 21:27). If they had been contributed to defray the cost of repairing the sacred edifice, they are to be redeemed, and then are burnt, as it is said ""The spoil thereof"" (Deut. 13:17), but not the possessions of God."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.14","14. The first born (of cattle) and the tithe of cattle found in the city, if without blemish, are treated like sacrifices for the altar, and suffered to die. If blemished, they are treated like the ordinary cattle of the city and are slain. Heave-offerings (Num. 18:11), found in it, which have passed into the possession of a priest, are to be left to rot, being his property. If they are still in the possession of the Israelite (owner of the produce) they should be given to a priest resident in another district, for they are God's property and intrinsically sacred."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.15","15. The Second Tithe (Deut. 14:22-23) and the money into which it has been converted (ibid. 14:24-26), and likewise sacred scriptures, found in a seduced city, must be put away in a place of concealment."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.4.16","16. Whoever executes judgment on a seduced city performs a meritorious act, as much as one who offers up a burnt offering that is wholly consumed, as it is said, ""Every whit unto the Lord, thy God"" (Deut. 13:18). Yea more, he averts fierce wrath from Israel, as it is said, ""that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of his anger"" (ibid. 13:18); and brings blessing and mercy upon Israelites, as it is said ""And show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee"" (ibid. 13:18)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.1","1. He who entices an Israelite man or woman to idolatry is stoned, even though neither the enticer nor the enticed worshipped an idol, but because he gave instruction to worship an idol. And whether the enticer was a layman or a prophet, or whether only one person—male or female—was enticed or a number of persons were enticed, the punishment is death by stoning."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.2","2. He who entices the majority of the inhabitants of a city to idolatry is a seducer and is not styled an enticer. If the seducer of the majority of a city was a prophet, he is put to death by stoning, and those who were seduced are dealt with individually and not as inhabitants of a seduced city, unless there were at least two seducers. Whether one says ""The idol said to me 'worship ye it' "" or says ""the Holy One, blessed be He, said to me 'worship ye the idol' "", in either case, he is regarded as a prophet who seduced. And if the majority of the inhabitants of a city went astray after him, he is put to death by stoning. The enticer, whether he used the plural or singular number, is put to death by stoning. For instance, if one says to another, ""I will worship an idol""; ""I will go and worship""; let us go and worship with the ritual especially used for that particular idol""; ""I will sacrifice""; ""I will go and sacrifice""; ""let us go and sacrifice""; ""I will burn incense""; ""I will go and burn incense""; ""let us go and prostrate ourselves"";—in uttering any of these phrases, he is an enticer. If he enticed two persons, they act as the witnesses. They bring him to the Court and testify concerning him that he had so spoken to them, and he is put to death by stoning."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.3","3. For the conviction of an enticer, no previous warning is required. If he spoke to a single individual, that person should reply ""I have friends who desire this"". And it should be so contrived that the enticer shall make his attempt at seduction before two witnesses, which is necessary to secure his condemnation to death. If the enticer will not consent to entice two persons, it is a duty to secure the evidence of concealed witnesses. In no other class of capital offences but this, is recourse had to this method. What is the procedure ? The one whom he attempted to entice, brings two men, and stations them in a dark place where they can see the enticer and hear his words, while the enticer cannot see them. He then says to the enticer, ""Say again what you said to me privately"". After the enticer has done so, the one whom he sought to entice replies, ""How can we give up our God who is in Heaven, and go and and worship blocks of wood and stones ?"" If the enticer retracts or keeps silent, he is not liable. But if he says ""This is our duty, and this, it is right for us to do"", then those who stood at a distance bring him to the Court and he is put to death by stoning."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.4","4. The execution of the enticer devolves upon the one he attempted to entice, as it is said, ""Thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death"" (Deut. 13:10). The latter is forbidden to love the enticer, as it is said ""Thou shalt not consent unto him"" (Deut. 13:9). Since, in reference to an enemy, it is said ""Thou shalt surely release it with him"" (Ex. 23:5), it might be supposed that this person (the enticer) should also be helped. It is therefore said ""Nor hearken unto him"" (Ibid. 13:9). Since it is said, ""Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbour"" (Lev. 19:16), it might be supposed that you are not to stand idly by the blood of this man. It is therefore said ""Neither shall thine eye pity him"" (Deut. 13:9). The enticed must not seek to exculpate the enticer, as it is said ""Neither shalt thou spare"" (Deut. 13:9). And if he is aware of a ground for the enticer's condemnation, he must not refrain from declaring it, as it is said, ""Neither shalt thou conceal him"" (ibid. 13:9). Whence is the prohibition inferred, forbidding a layman to entice to idolatry ? From the text ""And all Israel shall hear and fear""<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* The prohibition is implicit in the conclusion of this text. ""And they shall not continue to do wickedness like this in thy midst.""</i> (Deut. 13:12)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.5","5. If one enticed others to worship him, and said to them ""worship me"", and they worshipped him, he is stoned; but he is not stoned if they did not worship him, even though they accepted his statement and said ""yes"".<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** They said it in derision.</i> But if he enticed people to the worship of another person or to any other form of idolatry, and the one he addressed accepted his teaching and said ""yes, let us go and worship"", even though the latter did not yet carry out his intention, both the enticer and the enticed are stoned, as it is said, ""Thou shalt not consent unto him nor hearken unto him"" (Deut. 13:9), implying that one who does consent and hearken is liable to punishment."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.6","6. What is meant by a prophet who prophesies in the name of idolatry ? He is one who asserts ""This particular idol or particular star told me that it is a duty to do this and this or not to do it'. Even if his statement coincided with the law, so that he declared unclean that which is actually unclean and pronounced clean that which is clean, he is put to death by strangling, provided that he had been warned in the presence of two witnesses, as it is said, ""or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die"" (Deut. 18:20). The prohibition is implied in the text ""And make no mention of the name of other gods"" (Ex. 23:13)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.7","7. It is forbidden to engage in a controversy with, or refutation of, one who prophesies in the name of idolatry. Nor is he asked for a sign or token. Should he, on his own initiative, perform such a sign, we pay no heed to it nor reflect upon it. Whoever gives consideration to such signs, (thinking) that possibly they are true, violates a prohibition, as it is said ""Thou shalt not hearken to the words of that prophet"" (Deut. 13:4). A false prophet is put to death by strangling, even though he prophesied in the name of the Lord, and neither added to, nor took aught away from His commandments, as it is said, ""But the prophet that shall speak a word presumptuously in My name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die"" (Deut. 18:20)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.8","8. Whether one prophesies what he has not received in a prophetic vision, or, having heard the words of another prophet, declares that the message was directly communicated to himself—in either case, he is a false prophet and is put to death by strangling."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.9","9. Whoever refrains from slaying a false prophet because of his high standing, his mode of life being consistent with the prophetic calling, violates a prohibition, as it is said, ""the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously; thou shalt not be afraid of him"" (Deut. 18:22). Likewise, whoever refrains from declaring grounds for his condemnation, or stands in fear and awe of his words, is included among those who transgress the prohibition ""Thou shalt not be afraid of him"" (Deut. 18.22). The false prophet may only be tried by the Court of seventy-one judges."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.10","10. He who makes a vow in the name of an idol or swears by it, is punished with stripes, as it is said, ""And make no mention of the name of other gods"" (Ex. 23:13); and this is so, irrespective of whether he swore by it for himself<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Swearing in the name of an idol to do something.</i> or for an idolater<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** Swearing in its name to induce an idolater to do something.</i>. It is also forbidden to cause an idolater to take an oath by his object of worship. The mention of the name of an idol, not by way of oath, is also forbidden, as it is said, ""Make no mention"" (Ex. 23:13)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.5.11","11. A person should not say to another ""wait for me beside that idol"", or give a similar direction. The names however of any idol mentioned in the Scriptures may be uttered, such as Peor, Bel, Nebo, Gad, etc. It is forbidden to give others an occasion to make vows or confirm them in the name of an idol. That person only is punished with stripes who himself makes or confirms a vow in the name of an idol, that is, swears by its name."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.1","1. One who practises communion with ghosts or familiar spirits of his own free will and presumptuously, incurs the penalty of excision. And if witnesses were present and a warning had been previously given, he is put to death by stoning. If the offence had been committed unwittingly, he brings the appointed sin-offering. How is communing with ghosts practised ? The practitioner stands up, offers a certain kind of incense, holds in his hand a myrtle twig, and waves it. He pronounces softly certain words known to the practitioners of this art, till the one who consults him fancies that someone is conversing with him, and answering his questions in words that sound as if they came from beneath the ground in exceedingly low tones almost inaudible to the ear and only apprehended by the mind. Or he takes a dead man's skull, burns incense to it and uses arts of divination till one hears a sound as if a voice, exceedingly low, came from under his armpit and replied to him—all acts of such nature constitute communion with ghosts. Whoever does any of these things is put to death by stoning."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.2","2. How is communion with spirits practised ? The practitioner puts the bone of a bird called <i>Yadua</i> into his mouth, offers up incense and performs other acts till he falls down like an epileptic and utters predictions of future events. All these are species of idolatry. Whence is it inferred that they are prohibited ? From the text ""Turn ye not unto the ghosts nor unto familiar spirits"" (Lev. 19:31)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.3","3. He who, of his own free will and presumptuously, offers any of his offspring to Molech, incurs the penalty of excision. If he does so unwittingly, he brings the appointed sin-offering. If the offence was committed in the presence of witnesses and after warning, he is put to death by stoning, as it is said ""Whosoever…. that giveth of his seed unto Molech shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones"" (Lev. 20:2). Whence is it inferred that this is prohibited ? From the text ""And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to make pass to Molech"" (Lev. 18:21), and it is further said, ""There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire"" (Deut. 18:10). What is the procedure ? A great fire is kindled. The father takes anyone of his offspring and delivers him to the priests who are fire worshippers. Those priests give back the son to the father, after he had been delivered into their hands, that he may be passed through the fire with his father's consent. The father it is who passes his son over the fire with the priest's permission. He makes his son walk through the flames on his feet, from one side to the other. Not that he burns the child in honour of Molech, as sons and daughters were burnt in the worship of another species of idolatry, but merely passing (the child) through the fire constituted the service of the idol called Molech. Therefore, he who performs this ritual to an idol other than Molech, is not liable."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.4","4. The penalty of excision or stoning is not incurred unless the father delivers his son to Molech and makes him pass through the fire on his feet, leading him through. If he delivered him to Molech but did not make him pass through the fire, or if he made him pass without having delivered him to Molech, or if he delivered him to Molech and made him pass through the fire but did not lead him through, he is not liable. Nor is he liable unless he delivers some of his offspring only and leaves the others, as it is said, ""Because he hath given of his seed to Molech""; ""of his seed"", but not all his seed."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.5","5. One is liable for leading any of his descendants through the fire to Molech, whether they are legitimate or illegitimate, whether sons or daughters, their children or grand-children, or any descendants—all these being included in one's offspring. But if he led his brothers, sisters, ancestors, or himself, through the fire to Molech, he is not liable; or if he led his offspring, while asleep or blind, he is not liable."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.6","6. The pillar, which the Torah forbids is a structure at which all gather, even if the purpose is to worship God, for such was the custom of the idolaters; as it is said, ""Neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar"" (Deut. 16:22). Whoever sets up such a pillar, is punished with stripes. So too, in regard to the ""figured stone"" mentioned in the Torah—any one who prostrates himself on it, even to worship the Lord, is punished with stripes, as it is said ""Neither shall ye place a figured stone in your land to bow down yourselves upon it"" (Lev. 26:1)—it having been the custom of idolaters to place a stone before an idol that the worshipers might prostrate themselves upon it. We may not do the like unto the Lord. One is however not punished with stripes unless he spreads out his hands and feet on the stone so that he lies completely stretched out across it. This is the prostration mentioned in the Torah."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.7","7. This rule applies to all territories except the Temple, where it is permitted to prostrate oneself on the stones, as it is said, ""in your land"" (Deut. 26:1), which means that in your land you may not prostrate yourself, but you may do so on the cut stones in the Temple. Hence, all Israelites have the custom to spread mats, or any kind of straw or stubble over the stone floors of synagogues, to serve as a partition between their faces and the stones. If a worshipper was unable to procure anything which would separate him from the stone, he should go elsewhere to prostrate himself, or turn on his side and incline, so that his face will not touch the stone."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.8","8. Whoever prostrates himself to God on cut stones without extending his hands and feet is not punished with the statutory stripes (for violating a scriptural prohibition) but receives stripes for contumacy. If however he prostrates himself to an idol, whether with hands and feet extended or not, he incurs the penalty of death by stoning, as soon as he put his face to the ground."

He who plants a tree near the Altar or in any part of the Temple Court, whether the tree belongs to a species that does not bear fruit or is one that produces edible fruit, and even if he had planted it to adorn the Temple and enhance its beauty, is punished with stripes, as it is said, ""Thou shalt not plant thee an <i>Asherah</i> of any tree near unto the altar of the Lord, thy God"" (Deut. 16:21). The reason for the prohibition is that it had been the custom of idolaters to plant trees by the side of an idolatrous altar, so that people might assemble there."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.6.10","10. It is forbidden to erect wooden colonnades within the Temple, like those in courtyards, although they are built structures and not planted trees. The prohibition is an extreme precaution grounded on the terms of the phrase ""any wood"" (Deut. 16-21). All the colonnades and cornices projecting from the Temple walls were of stone and not of wood."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.1","1. An affirmative precept enjoins the destruction of any idol, articles subsidiary to its worship, and everything made for its sake, as it is said, ""Ye shall surely destroy all the places (wherein the nations that ye are to dispossess served their gods) (Deut. 12:2); and it is further said ""but thus shall ye deal with them, (ye shall break down their altars"") (ibid. 7:5). In the land of Israel, it is a duty actively to pursue idolatry till we have exterminated it from the whole of our country. Outside the Holy Land, however, we are not so commanded; but only that whenever we acquire any territory by conquest, we should destroy all the idols found there, as it is said, ""And ye shall destroy their name out of that place"" (Deut. 12:3); that is, in the Land of Israel, thou art enjoined actively to pursue them but not outside the Holy Land."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.2","2. An idol, articles subsidiary to its worship, sacrifices offered to it, and anything made for its sake, are forbidden to be used, as it is said, ""And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house"" (ibid. 7:26). Whoever makes use of any of these things is punished with stripes twice; once, for violating the prohibition ""thou shalt not bring etc."" (ibid. 7:26), and once, for violating the prohibition ""and there shall cleave naught of the devoted thing to thy hand"" (ibid. 13:18)."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.3","3. No use may be made of a beast that has been wholly offered up to an idol. This prohibition applies to its dung, bones, horns, hoofs and hide, and every part of it. Hence, if a mark on the hide indicates that it came off a beast that had been offered up to an idol—as, for example, a circular perforation which idolaters used to make over the heart, through which that organ was extracted—all the hides with this characteristic are forbidden to be used. And so with all similar indications."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.4","4. What are the distinctions between an idol belonging to an idolater and one belonging to an Israelite ? An idol belonging to an idolater is forthwith prohibited to be used: as it is said, ""the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire"" (Deut. 7:25); as soon as it has been made, it becomes his god. But an idol, the property of an Israelite, is not prohibited till it has been worshipped, as it is said, ""and setteth it up in secret,"" (Deut. 27:15); that is, performs mysterious rites that constitute its mode of worship. Articles used in idolatrous worship, whether belonging to an idolater or to an Israelite, only become forbidden after they have been so used."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.5","5. Whoever makes an idol for others, although he is punished with stripes, is nevertheless permitted to use the remuneration for his labour—and this is so, even if he made the idol for an idolater, in which case it becomes forthwith prohibited. The reason is that an idol does not become forbidden till it is completed; and the last tap of the hammer is worth less than a <i>perutah</i> (the smallest coin). If one purchased broken metal from an idolater and found an idol among the pieces—even if the purchaser had already paid the price, provided that he has not yet taken possession of the article—he returns it to the idolater. The same is the rule if he had taken possession but had not paid the price; for, although taking possession affects transfer of property from a gentile, the case here is analogous to a purchase under error. If, however, he had paid the price and also taken possession, he should cast the idol into the Dead Sea. So where an idolater and a proselyte inherited the property of their father who had been an idolater, the proselyte may say to the idolater: ""Do thou take the idol and I will take money; do thou take the prohibited wine and I will take fruit."" Once, however, these (prohibited articles) have come into the proselyte's possession, they are forbidden to be used."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.6","6. Figures made by gentiles as ornaments are permitted to be used, but those which they made for worship are forbidden. For example, all figures found in villages are forbidden, on the presumption that they were made for worship. But as for those in a city, if they are placed at the city gates, and the hand of the figure holds the form of a staff, bird, globe, sword, crown or ring, the presumption is that such a figure was erected for worship, and its use is forbidden. Otherwise, the figure is presumed to be ornamental and its use is permitted."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.7","7. Images, found discarded in the streets or among broken metal, may be used; needless to add, this is the rule also in the case of fragments. But if one finds a hand of an idol or its foot or any of its limbs, discarded, it is forbidden to be used. For as it is known for certain that the limb was part of a figure that had been worshipped, its prohibited status continues till one is sure that the gentiles annulled it as an object of worship."

If one finds articles bearing the figure of the sun, moon, or dragon, whether they are gold or silver vessels or robes of scarlet embroidered with any such figure, or earrings or finger rings so engraved, they are forbidden to be used. Other articles with these figures are permitted, the presumption being that the figures are ornamental. Other figures than those enumerated, on any vessels, are presumed to be ornamental, and the vessels may be used."

An idol, anything subsidiary to its service, or anything offered to it, however small, inhibits the use of objects with which it had become so completely mixed up that its identity is lost. For example, if an idol became mixed up with ornamental figures, even if it be but one idol among many thousands of such figures, all have to be destroyed<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Literally: cast into the Dead Sea.</i><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Literally: cast into the Dead Sea.</i>. So, if a cup used in idolatry had become mixed up with a large number of cups, or a piece of meat of an idolatrous sacrifice has become mixed up with several pieces of other meat, they must all be destroyed. So too, if a hide that had been perforated over the heart, had been mixed up with many hides (and cannot be identified), all the hides are forbidden. If one transgressed and sold an idol or any of its utensils, or anything offered to it, the monetary proceeds received are forbidden to be used; and, as in the case of the idol itself, any portion of those proceeds, however small it is, renders all monies with which it is mixed up, likewise forbidden; as it is said, ""And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house and be accursed like unto it"" (Deut. 7:26). Whatever thou obtainest from an idol, or from its utensils or from its offerings is forbidden like the idol itself."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.10","10. When an idol or an idolatrous tree has been burnt, its ashes are forbidden to be used. The live ember of an idol is forbidden, but the flame may be used, because it is without substance. Where it is doubtful whether an object is idolatrous, it may not be used. But where there is a double doubt,<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** That is, when it is doubtful whether the article in question even belongs to a group of objects any of which is only doubtfully idolatrous.</i> it may be used. For example, a cup used in idolatrous worship was inadvertently dropped into a store full of cups (and cannot be identified);—all the cups are forbidden to be used, on the principle that an idol or any one of its subsidiary articles, however small, renders everything with which it has become mixed up, forbidden. But if one of these cups was afterwards removed and became mixed up with two other cups, all three are permitted. If a ring belonging to an idol became mixed up with several rings, and two of these fell into the ocean, all the rest are permitted to be used, on the assumption that the idolatrous ring was one of the two that were lost. If it was mixed up with one hundred rings which were subsequently divided into two lots—forty in one, sixty in the other—and the forty accidentally became mixed up with other rings, all in this lot are permitted to be used—it being assumed that the idolatrous ring was in the larger original lot. If the sixty rings became mixed up with other rings, all are prohibited."

But eggs as well as unfledged birds that still need the mother-bird, are forbidden to be taken and used, because the idolatrous tree is, as it were their ""base"". The nest itself, situated on the tree top, is permitted, because the bird has brought its constituents from elsewhere."

Then it should be heated with other wood that is lawful, after which, bread may be baked in it. Bread baked in it before it had cooled, may not be used. If it became mixed up with other loaves, the price of the forbidden bread must be cast into the sea, so that one does not enjoy any of it, while the loaves are permitted to be used."

If such cloth became mixed up with other pieces of cloth, its price is to be cast into the sea and all the pieces of cloth may be used. Vegetables may be planted beneath an idolatrous tree, whether in summer, when they need shade, or in the rainy season; the reason being that both the forbidden shade of the idolatrous tree, and the soil which has not become forbidden, cause the vegetables to grow, and a product of two factors, of which one is forbidden while the other is permitted, is always permitted. Accordingly, a field fertilised with manure belonging to an idol, may be sown. A cow, fattened with vetches belonging to an idol, may be used for food. And so, in similar cases."

Meat, wine or fruit, set aside to be offered up to an idol, does not become forbidden, even after having been brought into the idolatrous temple, till it has been actually presented to the idol. Once this has been done, it is regarded as an idolatrous offering; and even if it is again taken out, it remains for ever forbidden. Any thing found in an idolatrous temple, even water or salt, is, by scriptural enactment, forbidden to be used, and one who partakes of it, in the minutest quantity, is punished with stripes."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.16","16. A garment, utensils or coins on the hand of an idol, if found in a position betokening contempt, may be used; if the position indicates respect, they are forbidden to be used. For instance, a purse found suspended about its neck, a garment folded and lying upon its head or a vessel leaning over its head, may be used, because the position indicates contempt, and so in similar cases. If the article found on its head is such that the like of it is offered up on the altar, it is forbidden to be used. These distinctions only apply to things found outside the place of worship. But if one found any such thing within an idolatrous place of worship, whether in a position indicating respect or contempt, whether it is suitable to be offered up on the altar or not—in short, whatever is found within such a place, even if it be only water or salt, is forbidden to be used. In the case of Peor and Mercury, anything found with them, within or without their respective places of worship, is forbidden to be used. This too is the rule with regard to the stones of Mercury; a stone that evidently belongs to it is forbidden to be used."

A bath or a garden belonging to an idol may be used, if no gratuity need be given, but may not be so used, if such has to be given.

"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.18","18. One may bathe in a bathhouse where there is an idol; because it has been set up there as an ornament and not to be worshipped, as it is said, ""their gods"" (Deut. 7:16); that is, when they are honoured as gods, not however, when they are treated with contempt, as in this case where the idol stands over the drains, and everyone urinates before it. But if such constituted its mode of worship, it is forbidden to enter such a place."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.7.19","19. If a knife belonging to an idol had been used to slaughter a beast, the carcase is permitted, because the act of slaughtering caused the beast to depreciate in value. But if the animal had been dangerously ill, the carcase is forbidden, because the value of the beast has been enhanced, and this enhancement is due to the use of a utensil belonging to an idol. So too, one may not cut meat with such a knife. But if the meat is cut in such a way as to spoil and destroy it, it is permitted."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.8.1","1. Anything which cannot be handled or made by a human being, even though it is worshipped, is permitted to be used. Hence, mountains and hills, trees originally planted for their fruit, public springs and cattle, though worshipped by idolaters, are permitted to be used. Fruits that had been worshipped, while they were unsevered, may be eaten as also flesh of a beast that had been worshipped. Needless to add, a beast that had only been set apart for idolatrous purposes may be eaten, whether it had been set apart to be worshipped or to be offered up as a sacrifice. The rule that the beast does not become forbidden to be used, applies if one had done nothing to it for the sake of idolatry. But if one has done anything to it, however insignificant, he renders it forbidden. For example, if one slaughters a beast and severs either of its vessels (the trachea or oesophagus) for the sake of idolatry, or exchanges it for an object of idolatrous worship, he renders it forbidden. Such is also the rule if one exchanges it for something for which an idolatrous object had been exchanged; for all the things successively exchanged have become monetary equivalents of an idolatrous object. These rules only apply to a beast that is the property of the individual who did these acts. But if one slaughters, with idolatrous intent, a beast belonging to another person, or exchanges it for an object of idolatrous worship, it does not become forbidden, since a person cannot cause that which is not his property to become forbidden. A man who prostrates himself to the soil in its natural state does not render in forbidden. But he renders it forbidden, if he digs in it pits, ditches or caves."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.8.2","2. If one prostrates himself to water carried by a wave, he does not render it forbidden. But if one took water in his hand and prostrated himself to it, he renders it forbidden. Mountain rocks that have become loosened and have been worshipped while still in their original situation, are permitted to be used, because they have not been handled by a human being."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.8.3","3. If an Israelite set up a brick, in order to worship it, but did not do so, and a gentile came and prostrated himself before it, he renders it forbidden to be used, the setting up constituting the act (requisite to show the Israelite's intent that is should be worshipped).<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Otherwise, the gentile could not render prohibited that which does not belong to him (VII. 4).</i> So too, if he set up an egg and a Gentile came and prostrated himself before it, he renders it forbidden to be used. If he cut a pumpkin or any thing similar, and worshipped it, he renders it forbidden to be used. If he worshipped half a pumpkin while the other half is still attached to it, the latter is forbidden to be used; because it is uncertain whether it is to be regarded as accessory to the half that was worshipped. A tree that was planted, from the outset, for the purpose of being worshipped, is forbidden to be used. This is the <i>Asherah,</i> mentioned in the Torah. If a tree had already been planted, and then was cut down and trimmed to serve as an idol, or even if a branch of it was forced into the ground and covered with soil or if it was grafted on another tree, and in either case produced twigs, these twigs are to be severed and are forbidden to be used, but the rest of the tree is permitted. So too, if any one worships a tree, although its trunk does not become forbidden, all twigs, leaves, shoots, and fruit which it produces, during the time that it is worshipped, are forbidden to be used. If Gentiles guard the fruit of a tree, declaring that it is intended to be converted into strong drink for a certain idolatrous temple, and they actually do make a strong drink of the fruit and drink it on their feast, the tree is forbidden to be used, because it is assumed to be an <i>Asherah</i> (idolatrous tree) and they deal thus with its fruit, because such is the ordinance of the <i>Asherah.</i>"
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.8.4","4. A tree, beneath which an idol was set up, may not be used, as long as the idol is there. Once the idol has been removed, the tree is permitted to be used, because it is not the object worshipped. A house which a gentile erected, with the original intent that it be worshipped, or a house already erected, that anyone worships, is forbidden to be used. If it had already been erected and was, for idolatrous purposes, plastered and ornamented so that it was renovated, the renovation is to be removed and may not be used, because it was made for idolatrous worship, but the rest of the structure is permitted to be used. If an idol was brought into a house—as long as it is there, the house is forbidden to be used; after it has been removed, the house may again be used. A stone, originally hewed to be worshipped, is forbidden to be used. If it had already been hewed and was then painted and decorated, that it might be worshipped, even if the decorations are in the stone itself and, needless to say, if these are only superficial, the added decorations are to be removed and are forbidden, since they were made for worship, but the rest of the stone is permitted to be used."
"LAWS CONCERNING IDOLATRY AND THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEATHENS,.8.5","5. A stone upon which an idol was set may not be used as long as the idol is on it. After the idol had been removed, it may be used. If one owned a house adjoining an idolatrous temple, and the house fell down, it may not be rebuilt. How should the owner act ? He should withdraw within the bounds of his own property and there rebuild the dwelling. The intervening empty space should be filled up with thorns or dirt, so that the area of the idolatrous temple will not be enlarged. If there was a party wall belonging to him and to the idol, he should consider the wall as divided in halves. The half on his side may be used. That on the side of the idol is wholly forbidden. Its stones, wood and earth are all forbidden to be used."

Even if an idolater is part-owner, the latter's nullification is of no avail, but it remains for ever forbidden to be used and must be concealed. So too, if an idol belonging to an idolater came into an Israelite's possession and was subsequently nullified by the idolater, the nullification is of no avail; the idol remains for ever forbidden. An Israelite cannot nullify an idol even with the idolater's permission. An idolater, who is a minor or mentally defective, cannot nullify an idol. If an idolater nullified an idol, belonging to him or to other idolaters, even if he did so under duress, and even if it was an Israelite that forced him, the object loses its idolatrous character, provided that the gentile who annulled it is actually an idol-worshipper. Nullification by one not actually an idol-worshipper is of no avail. The nullification of an idol nullifies its accessories. If the accessories were nullified, they may be used, but the idol itself remains forbidden as hitherto, until it has been nullified. Offerings to an idol can never be nullified."

If one chipped the tip of its ear, the tip of its nose, or its finger-tip, hammered in its face, even without loss of substance, or sold it to an Israelite who is a worker in metals, it is nullified. But if one pledged it or sold it to an idolater, or to an Israelite who is not a metal worker, or if <i>débris</i> fell upon it which the owner did not clear away, or if it had been stolen by robbers and no attempt has been made to reclaim it, or if one expectorated or urinated before it, or dragged it or threw ordure at it, it is not nullified."

An idol abandoned by its worshippers during a time of peace is permitted to be used, because it has been nullified (by the abandonement). If this has taken place in wartime, it remains forbidden, because the abandonment was on account of the war. If an idol had got broken of itself, its fragments are forbidden to be used, until the idol is nullified. Hence, if one finds fragments of an idol, they may not be used, for possibly the idolaters had not nullified it. If it consisted of parts that an unskilled person can put together, each of them must be separately nullified. If an unskilled person cannot put them together, the nullification of any limb of the idol makes all the fragments null."

What is the distinction between a hearth and an altar ? A hearth consists of a single stone; an altar, of many stones. How are the stones of the idol Mercury nullified ? As soon as an idolater has used them in erecting a building or in paving a road, and so forth, they are permitted to be used. How is the <i>Asherah</i> (an idolatrous tree) nullified ? As soon as the idolater plucked a leaf from it, cut off one of its shoots, took from it a stick or rod, or removed the bark when this was not necessary, it loses its idolatrous character. If this procedure was needed by the tree, it remains prohibited, but the shavings are permitted to be used. If the tree belonged to an Israelite, whether the scraping was necessary or not, the tree as well as the shavings are for ever forbidden to be used, because the idol of an Israelite can never lose its idolatrous character."

Three days before the idolaters' feast, it is forbidden to buy of them or sell to them anything durable; likewise to borrow of them or lend to them; repay to them money that had been borrowed or exact from them payment of a loan, secured by deed or pledge; but the payment of a personal loan (for which there is no pledge or deed) may be exacted, as it is equivalent to recovering from them what might otherwise be lost. Perishable products, such as vegetables or cooked food, may be sold to them, up to the day of their feast. These restrictions apply to Palestine.

The day on which idolaters meet to appoint a king, when they offer up sacrifices and sing hymns to their idols, is a feast day for them, just like their other feasts.

So too, if idolaters, who have suffered a bereavement, keep the day of death as a solemn day, the prohibition only applies to intercourse with the individuals who so observe it, and is limited to the day. Whenever, in connection with a death, utensils are burnt and incense is offered up, it is certain that idolatry forms an element in the obsequies. Commercial and social intercourse on a feast day is prohibited with those only who worship an idol on that day, but is permitted with those who make merry and eat and drink on it, observing the day as a custom or keeping it out of respect to the sovereign, but not accepting it as a religious feast."

If he was observed to be dying, he is not to be rescued. It is forbidden however, actively to destroy him, or thrust him into a pit or do any thing similar, since he is not waging war against us. These rules apply to a heathen. But as regards informers and Israelite infidels, it is a duty to take active measures to destroy them and hurl them into the pit of destruction—the reason being that they persecute Israelites and turn the people away from following God."

Houses are let to them in Palestine, provided they do not form a settlement; less than three families (living in one location) do not constitute a settlement. Fields are not let to them there; but in Syria they are let to them. And why were they (the Sages) so stringent with a field ? Because it would have two consequences: The land would be exempted from the payment of tithes; and it would give idolaters advantages from the soil of Palestine.

But buildings may be let to idolaters to be used for storage. The fruits of an orchard or field etc., may not be sold to them, while pendent on the tree or attached to the soil. But the owner may sell them the fruits after they have been severed, or on condition that he shall sever them and he does sever them. Why have these restrictions been imposed on sales ?

""Thou shalt not show them favour"" (ibid.); that is, ""they shall have no favour in thine eyes"", as this would induce a feeling of attachment to the idolater and cause us to learn from him his evil ways. So too it is forbidden to make gifts to them; these may however be bestowed on a denizen proselyte, as it is said ""unto the stranger that is within thy gates, thou shalt give it, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it to a foreigner"" (Deut. 14:21).

He must not enter our land, even as a temporary resident; or even as a traveller, journeying with merchandise from place to place, till he has undertaken to keep the seven precepts which the Noachides were commanded to observe; as it is said, ""They shall not dwell in thy land"" (Ex. 23:33)—even for a time.

These texts all refer to one theme and warn against imitating them. The Israelite shall, on the contrary, be distinguished from them and recognisable by the way he dresses and in his other activities, just as he is distinguished from them by his knowledge and his principles.

Some diviners make use of sand or stones; one bends down to the earth and screams; another fixes his gaze on a brass mirror or a lamp; and then they imagine things and speak accordingly. Another carries a staff in his hand, leans on it and strikes with it till his mind is in a state of abstraction and then he speaks; the prophet refers to this when he says, ""My people ask counsel of their stock and their staff declareth unto them"" (Hosea. 4:12)."

The charmer, while speaking, holds, in his hand, a key, stone or other objects—all this is forbidden. The charmer himself who held any object in his hand or did any act beside speaking, even if he only pointed with his finger, is punished with stripes according to the Scriptural statute, as it is said ""There shall not be found among you …. a charmer"" (Deut. 18:11). But if he only uttered words, and neither moved his finger nor his hand nor held any thing in his hand, he, as well as the person over whom the charmer uttered those sounds and who sits in his presence, fancying that he is deriving some benefit, are punished with stripes for contumacy; the latter because he took part in the charmer's folly.

Whoever believes in these and similar things and, in his heart, holds them to be true and scientific and only forbidden by the Torah, is nothing but a fool, deficient in understanding, who belongs to the same class with women and children whose intellects are immature. Sensible people, however, who possess sound mental faculties, know by clear proofs that all these practices which the Torah prohibited have no scientific basis but are chimerical and inane; and that only those deficient in knowledge are attracted by these follies and, for their sake, leave the ways of truth.

Whether he shaves the corners only, leaving the rest of the head untouched, or shaves the entire head at one time, he is punished with stripes, because he shaved the corners. The liability attaches to the man who shaves. But the man who is shaved is not punished with stripes, unless he assisted the barber.

Whoever is bound by the latter prohibition, is bound by the former. And since the latter prohibition cannot apply to a woman, neither does the former apply to her.

Removal of the hair at any one of these places involves the penalty of stripes. If one removes all of them at one operation, he is punished five times, but only if he uses a razor; as it is said, ""thou shalt not mar the corner of thy beard"" (Lev. 19:27), which refers to the use of the razor—this involving complete destruction of the hair, but there is no liability for cutting the beard with scissors.

In these respects, the custom of the country governs. A man who has put on women's adornments or a woman who has adorned herself in the modes peculiar to men, is punished with stripes. Whoever plucks out white hairs in his beard or in his head from among the dark, is punished with stripes—even if he has removed only one hair—the offence being the use of adornments peculiar to women. So too, one who dyes his hair a dark colour, even if he has only dyed a single white hair, is punished with stripes. One whose sex is undetermined and an hermaphrodite may not put on woman's apparel nor cut the hair of their heads in men's fashion; but if they do so, they are not punished with stripes."

As soon as one prints with any material that leaves an indelible mark, having previously made an incision in any part of the body, whether it be a man or woman, that person incurs the punishment of stripes. If he wrote on the flesh (by incision), without marking with printing matter, or marked with printing matter without writing (by incision), he is not liable. He is only liable if he has written (by incision) and made tattooing marks, as it is said, ""nor print any marks"" (Lev. 19:28).

Where the incision was for the dead, whether it was done with the hand or with an instrument, the offender is punished with stripes.

He is liable for making a bald spot in any part of his head just as much as if he made it in a line with the part which is between the eyes, as it is said, ""They shall not make baldness upon their head"" (Lev. 21:5).

But it is a duty of the father to teach his young son Torah; as it is said, ""And ye shall teach them, to your children, talking of them"" (Deut. 11:19).

Just as it is a man's duty to teach his son, so it is his duty to teach his grandson, as it is said, ""Make them known unto thy children and thy children's children"" (Deut. 4:9). This obligation is to be fulfilled not only towards a son and grandson. A duty rests on every scholar in Israel to teach all disciples (who seek instruction from him), even if they are not his children, as it is said, ""And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children"" (Deut. 6:7). On traditional authority, the term ""thy children"" includes disciples, for disciples too are called children, as it is said ""And the sons of the prophets came forth"" ((II Kings 2:3). This being so, why does the precept (concerning instruction) specifically mention (Deut. 4:9) a man's son and son's son ?

But the only obligation one owes to a neighbour's son is to teach him when it involves no expense. If a father has not had his son taught, it is the duty of the latter, as soon as he realises his deficiencies, to acquire knowledge for himself, as it is said, ""That ye may learn them and observe to do them"" (Deut. 5:1). And so too, you will find that study in all cases takes precedence of practice, since study leads to practice, but practice does not lead to study."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.1.4,"4. If a man needs to learn Torah and has a son who needs instruction, his own requirements are to be satisfied first. But if his son has better capacity and greater ability to grasp what he learns, then the son's education takes precedence. Still, even in this case, the father must not wholly neglect the study of the Torah. For, just as it is incumbent on him to have his son taught, so is he under an obligation to obtain instruction for himself."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.1.5,"5. A man should always first study Torah and then marry; for if he takes a wife first, his mind will not be free for study. But if his physical desires are so overpowering as to preoccupy his mind, he should marry and then study Torah."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.1.6,"6. When should a father commence his son's instruction in Torah ? As soon as the child begins to talk, the father should teach him the text ""Moses commanded us a law"" (Deut. 33:4), and the first verse of the <i>Shema</i> (""Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One"") (Deut. 6:4). Later on, according to the child's capacity, the father should teach him a few verses at a time, till he attains the age of six or seven years, when he should take him to a teacher of young children."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.1.7,"7. If it is the custom of the country for a teacher of children to receive remuneration, the father is to pay the fee, and it is his duty to have his son taught, even if he has to pay for the instruction, till the child has gone through the whole of the Written Law. Where it is the custom to charge a fee for teaching the Written Law, it is permissible to take payment for such instruction. It is forbidden however to teach the Oral Law for payment, for it is said ""Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as the Lord, my God, commanded me"" (Deut. 4:5). This means: ""Even as I (Moses) learnt (from God) without payment, so have ye learnt from me, gratuitously. And throughout the generations, whenever you teach, do so gratuitously, even as you learnt from me"". If a person cannot find any one willing to teach him without remuneration, he should engage a paid teacher, as it is said ""Buy the truth"" (Prov. 23:23). It should not however be assumed that it is permissible to take pay for teaching. For the verse continues ""And sell it not"", the inference being, that even where a man had been obliged to pay for instruction (in the Oral Law), he is nevertheless forbidden to charge, in his turn, for teaching it."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.1.8,"8. Every Israelite is under an obligation to study Torah, whether he is poor or rich, in sound health or ailing, in the vigour of youth or very old and feeble. Even a man so poor that he is maintained by charity or goes begging from door to door, as also a man with a wife and children to support, are under the obligation to set aside a definite period during the day and at night for the study of the Torah, as it is said ""But thou shalt meditate therein day and night"" (Joshua 1:8)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.1.9,"9. Among the great sages of Israel, some were hewers of wood, some, drawers of water, while others were blind. Nevertheless, they devoted themselves by day and by night to the study of the Torah. They are included among the transmitters of the tradition in the direct line from Moses."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.1.10,"10. Until what period in life ought one to study Torah ? Until the day of one's death, as it is said, ""And lest they (the precepts) depart from thy heart all the days of thy life"" (Deut. 4:9). Whenever one ceases to study, one forgets."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.1.11,"11. The time allotted to study should be divided into three parts. A third should be devoted to the Written Law; a third to the Oral Law; and the last third should be spent in reflection, deducing conclusions from premises, developing implications of statements, comparing dicta, studying the hermeneutical principles by which the Torah is interpreted, till one knows the essence of these principles, and how to deduce what is permitted and what is forbidden from what one has learnt traditionally. This is termed Talmud."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.1.12,"12. For example, if one is an artizan who works at his trade three hours daily and devotes nine hours to the study of the Torah, he should spend three of these nine hours in the study of the Written Law, three in the study of the Oral Law, and the remaining three in reflecting on how to deduce one rule from another. The words of the Prophets are comprised in the Written Law, while their exposition falls within the category of the Oral Law. The subjects styled <i>Pardes</i> (Esoteric Studies), are included in <i>Talmud.</i> This plan applies to the period when one begins learning. But after one has become proficient and no longer needs to learn the Written Law, or continually be occupied with the Oral Law, he should, at fixed times, read the Written Law and the traditional dicta, so as not to forget any of the rules of the Torah, and should devote all his days exclusively to the study of Talmud, according to his breadth of mind and maturity of intellect."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.1.13,"13. A woman who studies Torah will be recompensed, but not in the same measure as a man, for study was not imposed on her as a duty, and one who performs a meritorious act which is not obligatory will not receive the same reward as one upon whom it is incumbent and who fulfills it as a duty, but only a lesser reward. And notwithstanding that she is recompensed, yet the Sages have warned us that a man shall not teach his daughter Torah, as the majority of women have not a mind adequate for its study but, because of their limitations, will turn the words of the Torah into trivalities. The sages said ""He who teaches his daughter Torah—it is as if he taught her wantonness"" This stricture refers only to instruction in the Oral Law. With regard to the Written Law, he ought not to teach it to her; but if he has done so, it is not regarded as teaching her wantonness."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.2.1,"1. Teachers of young children are to be appointed in each province, district and town. If a city has made no provision for the education of the young, its inhabitants are placed under a ban, till such teachers have been engaged. And if they persistently neglect this duty, the city is excommunicated, for the world is only maintained by the breath of school children."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.2.2,"2. Children are to be sent to school at the age of six or seven years, according to the strength of the individual child and its physical development. But no child is to be sent to school under six years of age. The teacher may chastise his pupils to inspire them with awe. But he must not do so in a cruel manner or in a vindictive spirit. Accordingly, he must not strike them with whips or sticks, but only use a small strap. He is to teach them the whole day and part of the night, so as to train them to study by day and by night. And there is to be no holiday except on the eve of the Sabbath or festival, towards the close of the day, and on festivals. On Sabbaths, pupils are not taught a new lesson, but they repeat what they had already learnt previously, even if only once. Pupils must not be interrupted at their studies, even for the re-building of the Temple."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.2.3,"3. A teacher who leaves the children and goes out (when he should be teaching them), or does other work while he is with them, or teaches lazily, falls under the ban ""Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord with a slack hand"" (Jer. 48:10). Hence, it is not proper to appoint any one as teacher unless he is God-fearing and well versed in reading and in grammar."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.2.4,"4. An unmarried man should not keep school for the young because the mothers come to see their children. Nor should any woman keep school, because the fathers come to see them."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.2.5,"5. Twenty-five children may be put in charge of one teacher. If the number in the class exceeds twenty-five but is not more than forty, he should have an assistant to help with the instruction. If there are more than forty, two teachers must be appointed."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.2.6,"6. A child may be transferred from one teacher to another who is more competent in reading or grammar, only however, if both the teacher and the pupil live in the same town and are not separated by a river. But we must not take the child to school in another town nor even across a river in the same town, unless it is spanned by a firm bridge, not likely soon to collapse."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.2.7,"7. If one of the residents in an alley or even in a court wishes to open a school, his neighbours cannot prevent him. Nor can a teacher, already established, object to another teacher opening a school next door to him, either for new pupils or even with the intention of drawing away pupils from the existing school, for it is said, ""The Lord was pleased for His righteousness' sake, to make the Torah great and glorious"" (Is. 42:21)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.1,"1. With three crowns was Israel crowned — with the crown of the Torah, with the crown of the priesthood and with the crown of sovereignty. The crown of the priesthood was bestowed upon Aaron, as it is said, ""And it shall be unto him and unto his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood"" (Num. 25:13). The crown of sovereignty was conferred upon David, as it is said, ""His seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before Me"" (Ps. 89:37). The crown of the Torah however is for all Israel, as is it said, ""Moses commanded us a law, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob"" (Deut. 33:4). Whoever desires it can win it. Do not suppose that the other two crowns are greater than the crown of the Torah, for it is said, ""By me, kings reign and princes decree justice. By me, princes rule"" (Prov. 8:15-16). Hence the inference, that the crown of the Torah is greater than the other two crowns."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.2,"2. The sages said ""A bastard who is a scholar takes precedence of an ignorant High Priest; for it is said ""More precious it is than rubies"" (Prov. 3:15), that is (more to be honoured is the scholar) than the High Priest who enters the Innermost sanctuary.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* A play upon the word <i>Peninim</i> (rubies), taken as <i>Lifny v'lifnim</i> (High priest who entered the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement.).</i>"
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.3,"3. Of all precepts, none is equal in importance to the study of the Torah. Nay, study of the Torah is equal to them all, for study leads to practice. Hence, study always takes precedence of practice."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.4,"4. If the opportunity of fulfilling a specific precept would interrupt the study of the Torah and the precept can be performed by others, one should not intermit study. Otherwise, the precept should be performed and then the study be resumed."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.5,"5. At the Judgment hereafter, a man will first be called to account in regard to his fulfilment of the duty of study, and afterwards concerning his other activities. Hence, the sages said, ""A person should always occupy himself with the Torah, whether for its own sake or for other reasons. For study of the Torah, even when pursued from interested motives, will lead to study for its own sake."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.6,"6. He whose heart prompts him to fulfil this duty properly, and to be crowned with the crown of the Torah, must not allow his mind to be diverted to other objects. He must not aim at acquiring Torah as well as riches and honour at the same time. ""This is the way for the study of the Torah. A morsel of bread with salt thou must eat, and water by measure thou must drink; thou must sleep upon the ground and live a life of hardship, the while thou toilest in the Torah"" (Ethics of the Fathers 6:4). ""It is not incumbent upon thee to complete the task; but neither art thou free to neglect it"" (ibid 2:21). ""And if thou hast studied much Torah, thou hast earned much reward. The recompense will be proportionate to the pains"" (ibid 5:26).<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** The numbering of the paragraphs in the Ethics of the Fathers in the editions of the Mishna and in the editions of the liturgy does not always correspond.</i>"
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.7,"7. Possibly you may say: When I shall have accumulated money, I shall resume my studies; when I shall have provided for my needs and have leisure from my affairs, I shall resume my studies. Should such a thought enter your mind, you will never win the crown of the Torah. ""Rather make the study of the Torah your fixed occupation"" (ibid 1:15) and let your secular affairs engage you casually, and do not say: ""When I shall have leisure, I shall study; perhaps you may never have leisure"" (ibid 2:5)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.8,"8. In the Torah it is written, ""It is not in heaven…. neither is it beyond the sea"" (Deut. 30:12-13). ""It is not in heaven"", this means that the Torah is not to be found with the arrogant; ""nor beyond the seas"", that is, it is not found among those who cross the ocean. Hence, our sages said ""Nor can one who is engaged overmuch in business grow wise"" (Ethics of the Fathers 2:6). They have also exhorted us ""Engage little in business and occupy thyself with the Torah"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:12)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.9,"9. The words of the Torah have been compared to water, as it is said, ""O every one that thirsteth, come ye for water"" (Is. 55:1); this teaches us that just as water does not accumulate on a slope but flows away, while in a depression it stays, so the Words of the Torah are not to be found in the arrogant or haughty but only in him who is contrite and lowly in spirit, who sits in the dust at the feet of the wise and banishes from his heart lusts and temporal delights; works a little daily, just enough to provide for his needs, if he would otherwise have nothing to eat, and devotes the rest of the day and night to the study of the Torah."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.10,"10. One however who makes up his mind to study Torah and not work but live on charity, profanes the name of God, brings the Torah into contempt, extinguishes the light of religion, brings evil upon himself and deprives himself of life hereafter, for it is forbidden to derive any temporal advantage from the words of the Torah. The sages said ""Whoever derives a profit for himself from the words of the Torah is helping on his own destruction"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:17). They have further charged us ""Make not of them a crown wherewith to aggrandise thyself, nor a spade wherewith to dig"" (ibid 4:7). They likewise exhorted us ""Love work, hate lordship"" (ibid. 1:10). ""All study of the Torah, not conjoined with work, must, in the end, be futile, and become a cause of sin"" (ibid 2:2). The end of such a person will be that he will rob his fellow-creatures."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.11,"11. It indicates a high degree of excellence in a man to maintain himself by the labour of his hands. And this was the normal practice of the early saints. Thus, one secures all honour and happiness here and hereafter, as it is said ""When thou eatest of the labour of thine hands, happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee"" (Ps. 128:2). Happy shalt thou be in this world, and it shall be well with thee in the world to come, which is altogether good."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.12,"12. The words of the Torah do not abide with one who studies listlessly, nor with those who learn amidst luxury, and high living, but only with one who mortifies himself for the sake of the Torah, constantly enduring physical discomfort, and not permitting sleep to his eyes nor slumber to his eyelids. ""This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent"" (Num. 19:14). The sages explained the text metaphorically thus: ""The Torah only abides with him who mortifies himself in the tents of the wise."" And so Solomon, in his wisdom, said ""If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small indeed"" (Prov. 24:10). He also said ""Also my wisdom stood unto me"" (Eccles 2:9). This is explained by our wise men thus, ""The wisdom that I learnt in wrath,<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Play upon the word <i>aph</i> <span dir=""rtl"">אף</span>, meaning <i>also</i> and <i>wrath.</i></i>—this has remained with me."" The sages said ""There is a solemn covenant that anyone who toils at his studies in the Synagogue,<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** <span dir=""rtl"">בית הכנםת</span> Synagogue, where it was customary to study privately.</i> will not quickly forget."" He who toils privately in learning, will become wise, as it is said ""With the lowly (literally, <i>the reserved</i>) is wisdom"" (Prov. 11:2). If one recites aloud while studying, what he learns will remain with him. But he who reads silently soon forgets."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.3.13,"13. While it is a duty to study by day and by night, most of one's knowledge is acquired at night. Accordingly, when one aspires to win the crown of the Torah, he should be especially heedful of all his nights and not waste a single one of them in sleep, eating, drinking, idle talk and so forth, but devote all of them to study of the Torah and words of wisdom. The sages said ""That sound of the Torah has worth, which is heard by night, as it is said 'Arise, cry out in the night' (Lam. 2:19): and whoever occupies himself with the study of the Torah at night—a mark of spiritual grace distinguishes him by day, as it is said, 'By day the Lord will command His loving kindness, and in the night His song shall be with me, even a prayer unto the God of my life' (Ps. 42:9). A house wherein the words of the Torah are not heard at night will be consumed by fire, as it is said 'All darkness is laid up for his treasures; a fire not blown by man shall consume him"" (Job 20:26). 'Because he hath despised the word of the Lord' (Num. 15:31)—this refers to one who has utterly neglected (the study of) the words of the Torah."". And, so too, one who is able to occupy himself with the Torah and does not do so, or who had read Scripture and learnt <i>Mishnah</i> and gave them up for wordly inanities, and abandoned and completely renounced this study, is included in the condemnation, ""Because he hath despised the Word of the Lord"". The sages said, ""Whoever neglects the Torah because of wealth, will, at last be forced to neglect it owing to poverty. And whoever fulfills the Torah in poverty, will ultimately fulfill it amidst wealth"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:11, with order of sentences reversed). And this is explicitly set forth in the Torah, as it is said, ""Because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things, therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy"" (Deut. 28:47-48). It is also said ""That He might afflict thee…. to do thee good at thy latter end…."" (Deut. 8:16)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.1,"1. Torah should only be taught to a worthy pupil whose conduct is exemplary or whose disposition is simple. One however who walks in a way that is not good should first be reclaimed, trained in the right way and tested (as to his sincerity); then he is admitted into the <i>Beth Hamidrash</i> (College) and given instruction. The sages say: ""To teach a pupil who is unworthy is like casting a stone to Mercury (the idol), as it is said, ""As one puts a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool""<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* The stone does not stay long in the sling; it is soon shot out, so honour given to a fool does not stay long with him.</i> (Prov. 26:8). There is no honour but the Torah, as it is said, ""The wise shall inherit honour"" (Prov. 3:35). So too, if a teacher does not walk in the right way—even if he is a great scholar and all the people are in need of him—instruction is not to be received from him till he reforms; as it is said, ""For the priest's lips shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts"" (Mal. 2:7). Our sages applied this text thus: ""If the teacher is like an angel of the Lord of Hosts, they may seek the Law from his mouth. But if he is not, then they shall not seek the Law from his mouth."""
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.2,"2. How is instruction to be imparted ? The teacher is seated in the schoolroom facing the class, with the pupils around him like a crown, so that they can all see him and hear his words. The teacher is not to sit on a stool while his pupils are seated on the floor. Either all sit on the floor, or all on stools. Formerly the teacher used to be seated, while the pupils stood. But before the destruction of the Second Temple, it already had become the universal custom that pupils, while being taught, should be seated."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.3,"3. If it was his custom to teach the pupils personally, he may do so. If however, he taught through a <i>Meturgeman</i> (an interpreter), the latter stands between him and his pupils. The teacher addresses the interpreter, who declaims what he has just heard to all the pupils. And when they put questions to the interpreter, he asks the teacher. The teacher replies to the interpreter who addresses the answer to the one who put the question. The teacher should not raise his voice above the interpreter's voice. Nor should the latter raise his voice above that of the teacher, when he addresses a question to him. The interpreter may not detract aught from the teacher's words, nor add to them nor vary them—unless he is the teacher's father or instructor. In addressing the interpreter, the teacher uses the introductory formula: ""Thus my revered preceptor said to me"" or ""Thus my revered father said to me"". But when the interpreter repeats the words to the listener, he recites them in the name of the sage quoted, and mentions the name if he were the teacher's father or teacher, and says ""Thus said our Master so-and-so"" (naming him). He does so, even if the teacher abstained from naming the sage on the ground that it is forbidden to mention one's teacher or father by name."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.4,"4. If the teacher taught and his pupils did not understand, he should not be angry with them or fall into a rage, but should repeat the lesson again and again till they have grasped the full meaning of the Halacha (rule) he is expounding. So also, the pupil should not say ""I understand"" when he has not understood, but should ask again and again. And if the master is angry with him and storms at him, he should say ""Master, it is Torah. I need to learn, and my intellectual capacities are deficient."""
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.5,"5. A disciple should not feel ashamed before his fellow-students who grasp the lesson after hearing it once or twice, while he needs to hear it several times before he knows it. For if this makes him feel ashamed, he will go through college without having learnt anything. The ancient sages accordingly said, ""A bashful man cannot learn, nor a passionate man teach"" (Ethics of the Fathers 2:6). These observations only apply when the students' lack of understanding is due to the difficulty of the subject or to their mental deficiency. But if the teacher clearly sees that they are negligent and indolent in their study of the Torah and that this is the cause of their failure to understand, it is his duty to scold them and shame them with words of reproach, and so stimulate them to be keen. And in this regard, the sages said ""Arouse awe in the pupils"". It is thus improper for a teacher to indulge in frivolity before his pupils, or to jest in their presence, or eat and drink with them—so that the fear of him be upon them, and they will thus learn from him quickly."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.6,"6. Questions are not to be put to the teacher immediately on his entering the school, but only after his mind is composed. Nor should a pupil put a question as soon as he has come in, but only after he himself is composed and rested. Two pupils are not to put questions at one time. The teacher is not to be questioned on a topic not pertaining to the lesson, but only on the subject that is being treated, so as not to embarrass him. The teacher however should set ""pitfalls"" before his pupils, both in his questions and in what he does in their presence, in order to sharpen their wits, and ascertain whether they remember what he had taught them or do not remember it. Needless to add, that he has the right to question them on a subject other than that on which they are at the moment engaged, in order to stimulate them to be diligent in study."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.7,"7. No questions should be asked standing, nor answers given standing; nor should they be addressed by any one from an elevation, or from a distance, or when one is behind the elders. The teacher may only be questioned on the topic that is being studied. The questions are to be put in a respectful manner. One should not ask concerning more than three Halachoth (rules) in the topic."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.8,"8. Two individuals put questions. One of these questions is germane to the subject under discussion, while the other is not. Heed is given to the question that is germane. One question refers to a legal rule, the other to exegesis; the former receives attention. One question is exegetical; the other homiletical; the former is taken up. One question is homiletical <i>;</i> the other appertains to an inference a <i>fortiori;</i> the latter is answered. One question refers to an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, the other to an inference from similarity of phrases; the former is dealt with. Questions are put by two person, one of whom is a graduated scholar, the other a disciple; attention is paid to the scholar. One of them is a disciple, the other is unlettered; heed is given to the disciple. Where both are graduated scholars, disciples or unlettered, and the questions of both concern two legal rules, or two responses, or two practical issues, the interpreter may in these cases give the preference to either."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.4.9,"9. No one should sleep in the Beth Hamidrash (House of Study). If a student dozes there, his knowledge becomes a thing of shreds. Thus Solomon, in his wisdom, said, ""And drowsiness shall clothe one in rags"" (Prov. 23:21). No conversation may be held in the House of Study, except in reference to the words of the Torah. Even if one sneezes there, the others do not wish him 'good health'. Needless to add, other topics must not be discussed. The sanctity of a Beth Hamidrash is greater than that of synagogues."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.1,"1. Just as a person is commanded to honour and revere his father, so is he under an obligation to honour and revere his teacher, even to a greater extent than his father; for his father gave him life in this world, while his teacher who instructs him in wisdom, secures for him life in the world to come. If he sees an article that his father had lost and another article that his teacher had lost, the teacher's property should be recovered first, and then the father's. If his father and his teacher are loaded with burdens, he should first relieve his teacher and then his father. If his father and teacher are in captivity, he should first ransom his father. But, if his father is a scholar, even though not of the same rank as his teacher, he should first recover his father's lost property and then his teacher's. There is no honour higher than that which is due to the teacher; no reverence profounder than that which should be paid him. The sages said ""Reverence for thy teacher shall be like the fear of Heaven"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:15). They further said, ""Whoever distrusts the authority of his teacher—it is as if he disputes with the <i>Shechinah</i> !; as it is said, ""When they strove against the Lord"" (Num. 26:9). Whoever starts a quarrel with his teacher, it is as if he started a quarrel with the <i>Shechinah;</i> as it is said, ""Where the children of Israel strove with the Lord, and He was sanctified in them"" (Num. 20:13). And whoever cherishes resentment against his teacher—it is as if he cherishes resentment against the Lord, as it is said, ""Your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord"" (Ex. 16:8). Whoever harbours doubts about his teacher—it is as if he harbours doubts about the <i>Shechinah;</i> as it is said, ""And the people spoke against God and against Moses"" (Num. 21:3)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.2,"2. Who is to be regarded as disputing his teacher's authority ? One who sets up a college, holds sessions, discourses and instructs without his teacher's permission, during the latter's lifetime, and even if he be a resident in another country. To give decisions in his teacher's presence is forbidden at all times. Whoever gives a decision in his teacher's presence is deserving of death."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.3,"3. If there was a distance of twelve <i>mils</i><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* A <i>mil</i> (Hebrew mile) is 2,000 cubits.</i> between him and his teacher and a question was put to him concerning a rule of practice, he may give the answer; and, to save a man from doing what is forbidden, he may give a decision even in his teacher's presence. For instance, if he sees one committing a violation of the Law, because that person did not know that it is prohibited, or out of sheer wickedness, it is his duty to check the wrongdoer and say to him ""This is forbidden"". He should do so, even in the presence of his master, and even if the latter has not given him permission. For to save God's name from being profaned, we forego the honour due to the teacher. This however is only permitted casually. But to assume the function of a decisionist and give decisions regularly to all enquirers, even if he and his teacher live at opposite ends of the earth, is forbidden to a disciple, during his teacher's lifetime, unless he has his teacher's permission. Nor even after his teacher's death, may any disciple regularly give decisions, unless he has attained a standard of knowledge qualifying him to do so."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.4,"4. A disciple who is not thus qualified and nevertheless gives decisions is ""wicked, foolish and of an arrogant spirit"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:9). And of him it is said, ""For she hath cast down many wounded"" (Prov. 7:26). On the other hand, a sage, who is qualified and refrains from rendering decisions, withholds knowledge of the Torah and puts stumbling blocks before the blind. Of him it is said ""Even the mighty are all her slain"" (Prov. 7:26). The students of small minds who have acquired an insufficient knowledge of the Torah, and yet seek to aggrandise themselves before the ignorant and among their townsmen by impertinently putting themselves forward and presuming to judge and render decisions in Israel—these are the ones who multiply strife, devastate the world, quench the light of the Torah and spoil the vineyard of the Lord of hosts. Of such, Solomon, in his wisdom, said ""Seize for us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vineyard"" (Song of Songs 2:15)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.5,"5. A disciple is forbidden to call his teacher by his name, even when the latter is not present. This rule only applies if the name is unusual, so that any one hearing it knows who is meant. In his presence, the pupil must never mention his teacher's name, even if he desires to call another person who bears the same name; the same is the rule with his father's name. In referring to them even after their death, he should use a descriptive title, (""my honoured father"", or ""my honoured teacher""). A disciple may not greet his teacher or return his greeting in the same manner as people are wont to greet their companions and return their greetings. But he should bow to his teacher and address him with reverence and deference ""Peace be unto thee, my teacher"". If the teacher greeted him first, he should respond ""Peace to thee, my teacher and master""."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.6,"6. So too, he should not remove his phylacteries in his teacher's presence, nor recline in his presence, but should sit respectfully, as one sits before a king. He should not recite his prayers, while standing in front of his teacher, or behind him, or at his side; needless to add, that he must not step (backward or forward) side by side with the teacher, but should stand at a distance in the rear, not however, exactly behind his teacher, and then he can offer up his devotions. He must not go with his teacher into the same bath room. He must not sit in his teacher's seat. When his teacher and a colleague dispute with one another, he must not, in his teacher's presence, interpose his opinion as to who is right. He must not contradict his teacher's statements. He may not sit down in his teacher's presence, till he is told ""be seated"", nor stand up, till he is told to stand up, or till he obtains permission to stand up. And when he quits, he must not turn his back, but should retire with his face to his teacher."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.7,"7. It is his duty to rise before his teacher, from the moment he sees him at a distance, (and keep standing) till he disappears from view and is no longer visible; then the disciple may resume his seat. It is a person's duty to visit his teacher on the festivals."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.8,"8. Courtesy must not be shown to a pupil in the teacher's presence, unless the teacher himself is wont to show courtesy to that pupil. The various offices that a slave performs for his master, a pupil performs for his teacher. If however he is in a place where he is unknown, and has no phylacteries with him<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Only worn by free Israelites.</i>, and fears that people will say that he is a slave, he does not help his teacher to put on or remove his shoes. Whoever refuses his pupil's services, withholds kindness from him and removes from him the fear of Heaven<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** Suggested by the exhortation in the Ethics of the Fathers ""Let reverence for thy teacher be as the fear of Heaven"".</i>. A pupil who neglects any of the courtesies due to his master causes the <i>Schechinah</i> to depart from Israel."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.9,"9. If a pupil saw his teacher violating the ordinances of the Torah, he should say to him, ""Our master, thus and thus, hast thou taught us"". Whenever a pupil recites a dictum in his teacher's presence, he should say ""Thus, our master, hast thou taught us"". He should never quote a dictum that he has not heard from his teacher, without giving the authority for it. When his teacher dies, he rends all the garments he wears till he bares his breast. These rents he nver sews up. These rules only apply to the chief teacher from whom one has learnt most of what he knows. But his relation to one from whom he did not acquire most of his knowledge is that of a junior to a senior fellow-student. Towards such a senior student (who was at the same time his teacher), the disciple is not required to observe all the above-mentioned points of courtesy. But the junior has to stand up before him, and, on his demise, has to rend his garments, just as he does for a deceased relative for whom he mourns. Even if one learnt from a person one thing only, be it great or small, one has to stand up before that person and rend one's garments at his demise."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.10,"10. No scholar who possesses good manners will speak before his superior in knowledge, even if he has learnt nothing from him."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.11,"11. If one's chief teacher desires to excuse all his pupils or any one of them from all or any of these observances, he may do so. But even then, the disciple must show courtesy to him, even at the moment when he explicitly dispenses with it."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.12,"12. As pupils are bound to honour their teacher, so a teacher ought to show courtesy and friendliness to his pupils. The sages said ""Let the honour of thy disciples be as dear to thee as thine own"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:15). A man should take an interest in his pupils and love them, for they are his spiritual children who will bring him happiness in this world and in the world hereafter."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.5.13,"13. Disciples increase the teacher's wisdom and broaden his mind. The sages said, ""Much wisdom I learnt from my teachers, more from my colleagues; from my pupils, most of all"". Even as a small piece of wood kindles a large log, so a pupil of small attainments sharpens the mind of his teacher, so that by his questions, he elicits glorious wisdom."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.1,"1. It is a duty to honour every scholar, even if he is not one's teacher, as it is said, ""Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man"" (Lev. 19.32). The word <i>Zaken</i> (rendered ""old man"" refers to one who has acquired wisdom. When ought people to rise up before him ? At the moment that he has approached within four cubits, (and they should keep standing) till he has passed out of sight."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.2,"2. This courtesy is not to be observed in a bath-house nor in a latrine, for it is said, ""Thou shalt rise up and <i>honour</i>"" (Lev. 19:32); the courtesy of rising must be such as to express honour. Labourers, at the time when they are working, need not rise up before scholars, as it is said ""Thou shalt rise up and honour""; even as the ""honouring"" enjoined does not involve a monetary loss, so the courtesy of rising before the scholar is only required when it does not involve a monetary loss. And whence do we know that one should not shut one's eyes when a scholar passes, so as not to see him and thus evade the obligation of standing up before him ? It is inferred from the text ""And thou shalt fear thy God"" (Lev. 19:32); wherever the fulfilment of a duty is left to the conscience, the exhortation is added ""Thou shalt fear thy God""."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.3,"3. It is improper for a sage to put the people to inconvenience by deliberately passing before them, so that they should have to stand up before him. He should use a short route and endeavour to avoid notice so that they should not be troubled to stand up. The sages were wont to use circuitous and exterior paths, where they were not likely to meet those who might recognise them, so as not to trouble them."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.4,"4. The same rule applies to riding as to walking. As it is a duty to rise up before the sage when he walks, so this courtesy should be shown when he rides by."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.5,"5. Where three are walking on a road, the teacher should be in the middle, the senior (of his disciples) at his right, the junior on his left."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.6,"6. On seeing a <i>Chacham</i> (a sage or religious authority), one does not rise till he has approached within four cubits; and as soon as he has passed, one resumes one's seat. On seeing the <i>Ab-beth-Din</i> (head of a Court; in ancient times, Vice-President of the Great Synhedrion), one stands up as soon as he comes within sight, and does not sit down till he has passed on to a distance of four cubits beyond the observer. On seeing the <i>Nasi,</i> (the Patriarch of Palestine, in ancient times, President of the Great Synhedrion), one rises as soon as he is seen, and does not sit down till he is seated in his place or has passed out of sight. If the <i>Nasi</i> desires to dispense with the courtesy due to him, he may do so. When the <i>Nasi</i> enters an assembly, all present rise and do not sit down till he says to them ""sit"". When the <i>Ab-beth-Din</i> enters, two rows are formed. Those forming these rows on either side stand up while he passes between them till he is seated in his place. The rest of the people remain seated in their places."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.7,"7. When a <i>Chacham</i> enters, each person stands up as he approaches him within four cubits, and then resumes his seat, and so does the next one till the <i>Chacham</i> has reached his place and is seated. Sons of sages and their disciples, when the public requires their services, make their way over the heads of the people, to reach their places. It is however not praiseworthy for the disciples of the sages to be the last to enter. If one needs to withdraw (from the room)—when he returns, he goes back to his place. Young children, of sages who have enough intelligence to follow the discourse, face their father (when he is lecturing). If they are too young to understand, they face the people."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.8,"8. A pupil, in regular attendance, may only rise before his teacher in the morning and in the evening, so that the honour paid to the teacher shall not be more than that shown to God."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.9,"9. One rises up before an old man, advanced in years, even if he is not a sage. Even a learned man who is young rises up before an old man of advanced age. He is not obliged however to rise to his full height but need only raise himself sufficiently to indicate courtesy. Even a gentile who is aged should be shown courtesy in speech; and one should extend a hand to support him, as it is said, ""Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head"", without qualification."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.10,"10. Scholars do not go out to take part with the rest of the community in building, digging or similar work for the state, so as not to lose the respect of the common people. Nor are they assessed for the cost of building the walls, repairing the gates, paying the watchmen's wages, etc., or making a gift to the king. Nor are they obliged to pay a tax, jointly or severally levied upon the inhabitants of a city, as it is said, ""Yea, though they hire<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Joseph Caro in his <i>Keseph Mishnah,</i> explains this verse thus ""If they all study Torah (play upon <i>Yitnu,</i> which means in Aramaic, <i>they study</i>.), God will gather them; if only a few do so, they will be diminished"".</i> among the nations, now will I gather them up, and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of kings and princes"" (Hos. 8:10). So too, if a scholar has goods for sale, he is to be given the opportunity of disposing of them first; and no one else in the market is to be permitted to sell, till the scholar has first sold his stock. Similarly, if he has a cause pending and he is standing among a large number of suitors, his cause is taken first, and (during the hearing) he is seated."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.11,"11. It is exceedingly iniquitous to contemn sages or hate them. Jerusalem was only destroyed when its scholars were treated with contumely, as it is said ""But they mocked the messengers of God and despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets"" (II Chron. 36; 16); this means that they ""despised those who taught His words"". So too, the text ""And if ye shall abhor My statutes (Lev. 26:15) means ""if ye abhor the teachers of My statutes"". Whoever contemns the sages will have no portion in the world to come, and is included in the censure ""For the word of the Lord hath he despised"" (Num. 15:31)."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.12,"12. Although one who contemns the sages forfeits his portion in the world to come, yet if witnesses came forward and testified that a certain individual reviled a sage, even if only in words, the offender has incurred the penalty of excommunication. The Court (if he is found guilty) publicly excommunicates him and also imposes upon him a fine of one <i>litra</i><sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** <i>Litra</i> in gold = 25 gold denarii.</i> in gold, a penalty of uniform amount in all places, and this is given to the sage. Whoever reviles a <i>Chacham</i> in words, even after the latter's decease, is excommunicated by the Court, which lifts the ban after he repents. If the sage who has been reviled is living, the offender is only released with the concurrence of the person on whose account the ban had been imposed. To safeguard his honour, the <i>Chacham</i> may himself excommunicate a boor who treated him disrespectfully. For this, neither witnesses nor a previous warning are necessary. The ban is not removed till the offender has appeased the <i>Chacham.</i> If he died before this was done, three men constitute themselves a quorum and remove the ban. If the <i>Chacham</i> desires to forgive the offender, and does not excommunicate him, he is at liberty to do so."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.13,"13. When a teacher, to safeguard the honour due to him, excommunicated any person, it is the duty of all his disciples to treat that person as under the ban. But when a disciple excommunicated anyone, for his own honour's sake, the teacher is not bound to respect the ban, but the people must do so. Similarly, anyone whom the <i>Nasi</i> (Patriarch of Palestine) excommunicated is to be treated by all Israel as under the ban. But if all Israel excommunicated a person, the <i>Nasi</i> need not treat him as excommunicated. Whoever has been placed under a ban of excommunication in his own city, is to be so regarded in another city. But one, who has been placed under such a ban in another city than his own, is not under a ban in his own city."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.14,"14. The foregoing rules only apply to one who was excommunicated because he reviled scholars. But if one was excommunicated for other transgressions, the penalty for which is excommunication, even if the ban was pronounced by the humblest individual in Israel, the <i>Nasi</i> and all Israel are bound to respect it till the offender repents of the transgression for which he had been excommunicated and is released from the ban. There are twenty-four offences for which the ban is pronounced on an individual, irrespective of sex. The category is as follows:"
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.6.15,"1) Whoever reviles a <i>Chacham,</i> even after his decease; 2) Insults the messenger of a Court; 3) calls another person, a slave; 4) receives a citation from a Court to appear at its sessions, on a date fixed by the Court, and fails to attend; 5) slights any ordinance instituted by the Scribes, or, needless to add, any precept of the Torah; 6) whoever refuses to accept the decision of a Court, is placed under the ban of excommunication till judgment is satisfied; 7) whoever keeps on his premises anything noxious, such as a vicious dog or an unsafe ladder, is put under a ban till he removes the nuisance; 8) whoever sells any of his real property to an idolater, is excommunicated till he assumes liability for all injuries that may accrue from the idolater to his Israelite neighbour who owns adjacent property; 9) whoever testifies concerning an Israelite before the idolaters' courts and the effect of his testimony is to force the Israelite to make a payment for which, he would not, according to Jewish Law, have been liable, is placed under a ban till he makes restitution; 10) a butcher, who is a <i>Cohen</i> (priest descended in the male line of Aaron), and who does not separate the portions of a slaughtered beast due to the priest and give them to another priest, is placed under a ban till he does so; 11) whoever violates the sanctity of the second days of the Festivals, notwithstanding that the observance of these days is due to custom; 12) whoever does manual labour on the Eve of Passover, after midday; 13) takes God's name in vain; or takes it with an oath, in matters of no importance; 14) causes the public to profane God's name; 15) causes the public to eat sacrifices outside the prescribed bounds; 16) calculates, outside of Palestine, the annual calendar, and appoints dates for the beginning of the month; 17) causes the blind to stumble; 18) keeps the public from fulfilling a religious duty; 19) a slaughterer who permits forbidden meat to leave his premises as fit for Jewish consumption; 20) or who has not examined his slaughtering knife in the presence of the <i>Chacham</i> (religious head of the community); 21) whoever deliberately practises priapism; 22) whoever divorces his wife and then enters into a partnership with her, or engages in other commercial transactions which bring them into close relations—when they come into Court (i.e. when they come under the notice of the Court) they are placed under a ban; 23) a religious leader of evil repute; 24) whoever unjustly excommunicates one who has not incurred the ban."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.1,"1. If a sage grown old in wisdom, a <i>Nasi,</i> or <i>Ab-beth-Din,</i> committed a grave offence, he is, under no circumstances, to be publicly excommunicated, unless he acted like Jeroboam, the son of Nebat and his confederates. But if he committed other sins less heinous, he is punished with stripes privately, as it is said ""Therefore shalt thou stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night"" (Hosea 4:5); this means that even if he stumbled, conceal it as in the darkness of the night. And we also say to him ""Save your self-respect and stay at home"" (II Kings 14:6). So too, if any scholar rendered himself liable to excommunication, the Court is forbidden to act precipitately and hastily put him under the ban. The members of the Court should flee from such a procedure, and take no part in it. The saints among the sages gloried in the fact that they never sat in a quorum of judges, to excommunicate a scholar, though they might sit as judges in a court that sentenced a scholar to be punished with stripes, if he had incurred that penalty, and even if the sentence was for contumacy."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.2,"2. What is the form used for <i>Niddui</i> (the lighter ban of excommunication)? (The authority who excommunicates) says ""So-and-so (naming him) shall be under a ban"". If the excommunication took place in the offender's presence, he says to him ""This person, (naming him) is under a ban. For <i>Cherem</i> (the severer excommunication), he says to him ""So-and-so (naming him) is under <i>Cherem</i> and accursed; he is under an imprecation with Oath and Ban""."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.3,"3. How is the lighter or severer excommunication removed ? The authority says to the person excommunicated ""Thou art released; thou art forgiven"". If the person is released in his absence, the formula is ""So-and-so (naming him) is released and forgiven""."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.4,"4. How should a person under the milder ban conduct himself, and how should others conduct themselves towards him ? During the whole of the term for which he has been excommunicated, he is, like a mourner, forbidden to have his hair cut or to bathe. He is not counted in the quorum of three or ten, required for reciting the special introduction to the Grace after Meals. He is not included in the congregation of ten men for any function that requires that number. No one may sit down within four cubits of where he is. He may however teach and be taught. He may be hired and hire others. If he dies, while under the ban, the Court orders a stone to be put on his coffin, as much as to say that he is stoned because he is separated from the community. Needless to state that no funeral eulogy is delivered, and his bier is not followed."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.5,"5. One who is in <i>Cherem</i> (under the severer ban of excommunication) suffers the additional severities that he may neither instruct nor receive instruction, but he studies privately, so as not to forget what he had learnt. He may neither be hired nor may he hire others. No one engages in commercial transactions with him, except to a slight extent, as much as is sufficient to provide him with a livelihood."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.6,"6. If a person has been for thirty days under <i>Niddui</i> (the milder ban) and made no request to be released, the ban is imposed for a second term of thirty days. If this period also passed without his seeking to have the ban removed, he is placed under the severer ban."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.7,"7. How many persons are needed to remove the milder or severer ban ? Three, even if they are private individuals. A qualified scholar can by himself remove the lighter or graver ban. A disciple has the right to do so, even in the locality where his teacher resides."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.8,"8. If three persons pronounced a ban of excommunication and left the place, and the offender renounced the practice for which he had been excommunicated, three others may proceed to release him."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.9,"9. If one does not know who it was that imposed the ban upon him, he should go to the <i>Nasi</i> and he will release him from the ban."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.10,"10. A ban that is conditional, even if self-imposed, requires annulment. A scholar who excommunicated himself, may himself annul the ban, even when he had added to it the clause, ""According to the view of So-and-so"", and even though the excommunication was for a transgression for which he had incurred that penalty."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.11,"11. A man who dreamt that he had been excommunicated, even if he knows who it was that had (in his dream) excommunicated him, requires ten men who study <i>Halachoth</i> (legal rules) to release him from the ban. If he does not find them, he must go as far as a <i>Parsah</i> (four <i>mils</i>) to seek them. If he fails to find ten men with these qualifications, ten men who study <i>Mishna</i> may release him. Failing these, he may be released by ten who can read Scripture. If such are not accessible, he may be released by ten men even if they are unable to read Scripture. If he cannot find ten men in his locality, three individuals may release him."
LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH.7.12,"12. If the ban was imposed on a person in his presence, it can only be removed in his presence. If it was imposed in his absence, it may be removed in his presence or absence. No interval of time need elapse between the imposition of a ban and its annulment, but the pronouncement of a ban may be immediately followed by its removal if the individual under the ban reforms. The Court may, at its discretion, leave a man under the ban for many years, according to the extent of his wickedness. If the Court see fit straightway to impose upon a person the <i>Cherem</i> (severer ban), and the same ban on any one who eats or drinks with him or stays near him within the distance of four cubits, they may do so in order to punish the offender and build a fence round the Torah, so that sinners shall not break bounds. Although a  <i>Chacham</i> has the right to pronounce the ban to safeguard his honour, it is not creditable for a scholar to accustom himself to this procedure. He should rather close his ears to remarks of the illiterate and take no notice of them, as Solomon, in his wisdom, said ""Also pay not heed to all the words that are spoken"" (Eccles. 7:21). Such too, was the way of the ancient saints. They heard themselves reviled and made no reply. Yet more, they forgave the reviler and pardoned him. Great sages, glorying in their commendable practices, said that they never, for the sake of personal honour, imposed on any one the lighter or severer ban. This is the way of scholars, which it is right to follow. It however only applies to cases where one has been reviled in private. But a scholar, who has been treated with contumely or been reviled in public, may not forgive the wrong done to his honour. If he does so, he is punished, for this is contempt of the Torah. We should relentlessly pursue the matter, till the offender begs his pardon, after which he should be forgiven."

"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.1.1","1.<sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">*** The Roman numerals in the following chapters correspond to the Hebrew numerals at the beginning of the paragraphs in the manuscript which do not follow the same division as in the printed editions. The first paragraph in each of the following chapters is not marked by a numeral in the manuscript. The Arabic numerals correspond to those in the printed editions.</i> With regard to all the precepts of the Torah, affirmative or negative, if a person transgressed any one of them, either wilfully or in error, and repents and turns away from his sin, he is under a duty to confess before God, blessed be He, as it is said, ""When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the Lord, and that person be guilty, then they shall confess their sin which they have done"" (Num. 5:6-7); this means <i>confess in words</i>; and this confession is an affirmative precept.<sup>****</sup><i class=""footnote"">**** There is no numeral (<span dir=""rtl"">ב</span>) there in the Hebrew Manuscript; the new paragraph is indicated by an empty space.</i> How does one confess ? The penitent says ""I beseech thee, O Lord, I have sinned, I have acted perversely; I have transgressed before Thee, and have done thus and thus, and lo, I repent and am ashamed of my deeds, and I will never do this again"". This constitutes the essence of Confession. The fuller and more detailed the confession one makes, the more praiseworthy is he. III. And so, those who were under an obligation to bring sin-offerings and trespass-offerings, when they bring their sacrifices for sins committed in error or wilfully, are not forgiven through those offerings, till they have repented and made confession in words, as it is said, ""….he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned"" (Lev. 5:5). IV. So too, those who incurred the judicial penalty of death or punishment of stripes, do not obtain forgiveness by suffering death or receiving stripes unless they repent and confess. Similarly, one who inflicted a wound on another person, or caused him monetary damage, even though he pays what is due to the injured party, does not obtain pardon till he confesses and penitently resolves never to commit the same offence again, as it is said, ""(when a man or woman) shall commit any sin that men commit …. then they shall confess"" (Num. 5:6-7)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.1.2","2. V. Since the scapegoat, was an atonement for all Israel, the High Priest made confession over it in the name of all Israel, as it is said ""and he shall confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel"" (Lev. 16:21). VI. The scapegoat atoned for all transgressions mentioned in the Torah, both light and grave, whether committed presumptuously or in error, whether the offender became aware of his transgression, or did not become aware of it; for all sins the scapegoat atoned, provided that the offender repented. But if he did not repent, then the scapegoat only secures forgiveness for the light transgressions. VII. Which are the light, and which the grave transgressions ? The grave transgressions are those which make the offender liable to a judicial sentence of death or to excision. Likewise, oaths taken in vain or to support a falsehood, though not involving the penalty of excision, are classed among the grave transgressions. Violations of other prohibitions and of affirmative precepts, the neglect of which is not punished by excision, constitute the light transgressions."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.1.3","3. VIII. At the present time, when the Temple no longer exists, and we have no altar for atonement, nothing is left but repentance. Repentance atones for all transgressions. Even if a man was wicked all the days of his life and repented at the end, nothing of his wickedness is recalled to him, as it is said ""And as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not stumble thereby in the day that he turns from his wickedness"" (Ezek. 33:12). The Day of Atonement itself atones for the penitent, as it is said, ""For on this day, shall atonement be made for you"" (Lev. 16:30)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.1.4","4. IX. Although Repentance atones for all offences and the Day of Atonement serves as atonement, still there are some transgressions that are forgiven immediately, while others are pardoned only after a time. For example, if a person transgressed an affirmative precept, the neglect of which is not punished by excision, and repented, he is forgiven straightway. Of those who commit this class of offences, it is said, ""Return ye backsliding children, I will heal your backsliding"" (Jerem. 3:22). X. A person violated a prohibition, the penalty for which is neither excision nor a judicial sentence of death and repented, the repentance stays the punishment and the Day of Atonement secures pardon. Of this class of offences, it is said, ""For on this day shall atonement be made for you"" (Lev. 15:30). XI. A person committed transgressions for which the penalty is excision or a judicial sentence of death, and repented; repentance together with the Day of Atonement stay the punishment, and afflictions that come upon him complete the expiation; and indeed, till he has suffered afflictions, the expiation is not completed. Of this class of offence, it is said, ""Then will I visit their transgressions with the rod and their iniquity with strokes"" (Ps. 89:33). XII. This is only so if, at the time when he transgressed, he had not profaned the Name of God. But if one profanes God's Name, even though he repents, even though the Day of Atonement comes and he is still penitent, even if he suffers afflictions, his atonement is not completed till he dies. Repentance, the Day of Atonement and afflictions—all of them together—serve to stay punishment, and death secures forgiveness, as it is said, ""And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of Hosts, surely this iniquity shall not be expiated by you till ye die"" (Is. 22:14)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.1","1. What is perfect repentance ? It is so when an opportunity presents itself for repeating an offence once committed, and the offender, while able to commit the offence, nevertheless refrains from doing so, because he is penitent and not out of fear or failure of vigour. For instance, if a man had sinful intercourse with a woman, and after a time was alone with her, his passion for her persisting, his physical powers unabated while he continued to live in the same district where he had sinned, and yet he refrains and does not transgress, he is a sincere penitent. And so Solomon said, ""Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say 'I have no pleasure in them'"" (Eccles. 12:1). II. If however, a person only repented in old age, at a time when he is no longer capable of doing what he had done—although this is not an excellent mode of repentance, it nevertheless avails him and he is accepted as a penitent. Even if one transgressed all his life and only repented on the day of his death and dies penitent, all his iniquities are pardoned to him, as it is said ""Before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain"" (Eccles. 12:2)—which is an allusion to the day of death. Hence the inference that if one remembers his Creator and repents before death, he is forgiven."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.2","2. III. What is Repentance ? It consists in this, that the sinner abandon his sin, remove it from his thoughts, and resolve in his heart never to repeat it, as it is said, ""let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts"" (Is. 55:7); that he regret the past, as it is said, ""Surely, after that I turned I repented, after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh"" (Jer. 31:19); that he calls Him who knows all secrets to witness that he will never return to this sin again, as it is said, ""neither will we call any more the work of our hands our God, for in Thee the fatherless findeth mercy"" (Hos. 14:4). It is also necessary that he make oral confession and utter the resolutions which he made in his heart."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.3","3. IV. He who confesses in words and has not in his heart resolved to forsake his sin is like one who baptizes himself and keeps in his hand a creeping thing. Unless he casts it away, his baptism is useless. And thus it is said, ""but whoso confesseth and forsaketh (them) shall obtain mercy"" (Prov. 28:13). Moreover it is necessary to specify the sin, as it is said, ""O, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them a god of gold"" (Ex. 32:31)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.4","4. V. Some of the modes of manifesting repentance are that the penitent cries continuously before the Lord with tears and supplications; gives charity according to his means; keeps far away from that wherein he sinned; changes his name, as much as to say: ""I am another individual and not the one who committed those deeds""; changes all his activities for a better course, for the righeous way; and exiles himself from his former place of residence, since exile atones for iniquity, inducing, as it does, humility, meekeness and lowliness of spirit."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.5","5. VI. It is highly praiseworthy in a penitent to make public confession, openly avow his transgressions and discover to others his sins against his fellow-men; he should say to them: ""Truly, I have sinned against so and so, and did thus and thus to him; and 10, this day, I repent and feel remorse"". He, however, who is proud and does not publish his trespasses but conceals them, has not achieved complete repentance, as it is said, ""He who covereth his transgressions shall not prosper"" (Prov. 28:13). VII. This only applies to transgressions in matters between man and man. But sins committed against God, the penitent need not publish. Indeed, it is a mark of effrontery on his part if he does so, but he should repent of them before the Almighty, blessed be He, declaring in detail his sins before Him, and make public confession in general terms; and it is well for him that his iniquity has not become known, as it is said, ""Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered"" (Ps. 32:1)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.6","6. VIII. Although repentance and supplication are always good, they are particularly so and are immediately accepted during the ten days intervening between the New Year and the Day of Atonement, as it is said, ""Seek the Lord while He may be found"" (Is. 55:6). This only applies, however, to an individual. But as for a community, whenever its members repent and offer supplications with sincere hearts, they are answered, as it is said, ""For what great nation is there that hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord, our God, whensoever we call to Him"" (Deut. 4:7)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.7","7. IX. The Day of Atonement is the time of repentance for all, for the individual as well as for the multitude. It is the goal of the penitential season, appointed unto Israel for pardon and forgiveness. Hence, all are under the obligation of repenting and making confession on the Day of Atonement. The duty of confession, on the Day of Atonement, requires that a person should begin to make his confession already on the previous day, before he takes his meal, lest he choke (while he is eating) without having confessed. And notwithstanding that he had already made confession, he confesses again on the night of the Day of Atonement, during the evening service, and again in the morning service, additional, afternoon and concluding services. At which part of the service is the confession made ? It is recited by the individual after the <i>Amidah;</i> by the reader of the congregation, during the <i>Amidah</i>, in its fourth blessing."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.8","8. X. The formula of confession adopted by all Israel is the sentence ""Verily we have sinned"". This is the essence of the confession. Transgressions, confessed on one Day of Atonement, are again confessed on the next Day of Atonement, even if one has continued penitent, as it is said, ""For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me"" (Ps. 51:5)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.9","9. XI. Repentance and the Day of Atonement only secure forgiveness for transgressions against God; as, for example, when one has partaken of forbidden food or indulged in illicit intercourse, and so forth. But transgressions against one's fellow-men, as for instance, if one wounds, curses or robs his neighbour or commits similar wrongs, are never pardoned till the injured party has received the compensation due to him and has also been appeased. XII. Even though he has made the compensation, the wrongdoer must also appease the one he has injured and ask his forgiveness. Even if a person only annoyed another in words, he has to pacify the latter and entreat him till he has obtained his forgiveness. XIII. If however, the injured party is unwilling to forgive, he should bring three of his friends at one time, and they should entreat the person offended, and solicit his pardon. If they fail, he should take with him a second and even a third group. If the offended person continues obdurate, he leaves him alone and goes away. The one who refused to forgive is now the sinner. But if the offended person was the offender's teacher, the pupil has to go to him again and again, even a thousand times, till pardon has been granted."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.10","10. XIV. It is forbidden to be obdurate and not allow oneself to be appeased. On the contrary one should be easily pacified and find it difficult to become angry. And, when asked by an offender for forgiveness, one should forgive with a sincere mind and willing spirit. Even if one had been much vexed and grievously wronged, he is not to avenge nor bear a grudge. Forgiveness is natural to the seed of Israel, characteristic of their upright heart. Not so are the hard-hearted heathens. ""His resentment keeps for ever"" (Amos 1:11). Thus, of the Gibeonites who did not forgive and refused to be appeased, it is said, ""Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel"" (II Sam. 21:2)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.2.11","11. XV. If a person sinned against another and the latter died before pardon was sought, the sinner should bring ten men, station them at the grave of the deceased, and, in their presence, make the declaration: ""I sinned against the Lord, God of Israel and against this individual, having committed such and such a wrong against him"". If he owed the deceased money, he should pay it to the heirs. If he did not know of any heirs, he should deposit the amount in Court, and make confession."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.1","1. Every human being has merits and iniquities. One whose merits exceed his iniquities is righteous. He whose iniquities exceed his merits is wicked. If the two balance in an individual, he belongs to the intermediate class. II. So it is with a country. If the merits of all its inhabitants exceed their iniquities, the country is righteous. If their iniquities preponderate, it is a wicked country. So too is it with regard to the whole of the world."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.2","2. III. A person whose iniquities exceed his merits perishes forthwith in his wickedness, as it is said, ""For the multitude of thy iniquity"" (Hosea. 9:7). So too, a country, the iniquities of whose inhabitants preponderate, perishes forthwith, as it is said, ""the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah, because it is great"" (Gen. 18:20). So, with the entire world, if the iniquities of its human population exceed their merits, they are destroyed forthwith, as it is said, ""And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth"" (Gen. 6:5). IV. This valuation takes into account not the number but the magnitude of merits and iniquities. There may be a single merit that outweighs many iniquities, as it is said, ""Because in him there is found some good thing"" (I. Kings 14:13). And there may be one iniquity that counterbalances many merits, as it is said ""But one sinner<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* In the sense of <i>one sin.</i> <span dir=""rtl"">חֵטא</span></i> destroyeth much good"" (Eccles. 9:19). The valuation is according to the knowledge of the Omniscient God. He alone knows how to set off merit against iniquities."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.3","3. V. Whoever regrets the precepts that he had fulfilled and wonders at his meritorious deeds, saying to himself, 'What profit have I of them ? Would that I had not done them', forfeits the credit for all of them, and none of his meritorious deeds is ever remembered in his favour, as it is said„ ""The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him on the day of his transgression"" (Ezek. 33:12); that is, if he regrets his former good deeds. VI. And even as a man's meritorious deeds and iniquities are balanced at the hour of death, so are the iniquities of every single inhabitant of the Earth weighed against his merits annually on the New Year Feast. He who is found righteous is sealed unto life; he who is found wicked is sealed unto death. If one belongs to the intermediate class, sentence on him is suspended till the Day of Atonement. If he repents, he is sealed unto life; if he does not do so, he is sealed unto death."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.4","4. VII. Although the Sounding of the Shofar on the New Year is a decree of Holy Writ<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* To be obeyed without question as to its purpose.</i>, still it has a deep meaning, as if saying, ""Awake, awake, O sleepers, from your sleep; O slumberers, arouse ye from your slumbers; and examine your deeds, return in repentance, and remember your Creator. Those of you who forget the truth in the follies of the times and go astray, the whole year, in vanity and emptiness, which neither profit nor save, look to your souls; improve your ways and works. Abandon, everyone of you, his evil course and the thought that is not good"". VIII. It is necessary therefore that every one, throughout the year, should regard himself as if he were half innocent and half guilty; and should regard the whole of mankind as half innocent and half guilty. If then he commits one more sin, he presses down the scale of guilt against himself and the whole world and causes his destruction. If he fulfills one commandment, he turns the scale of merit in his favour and in that of the whole world, and brings salvation and deliverance to all his fellow-creatures and to himself, as it is said, ""the righteous man is the foundation of the world"" (Prov. 10:25); that is to say, that he who acts justly presses down the scale of merit in favour of all the world and saves it. IX. And because of these considerations, the whole house of Israel have the custom to increase their charities and other good deeds from the New Year to the Day of Atonement and engage in religious duties at this period to a larger extent than during the rest of the year. So too, during these ten days, all rise up while it is still night, and pray in the synagogues till dawn, with fervent entreaties and supplications."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.5","5. X. When a person's iniquities and merits are weighed, the first offence that he committed is not counted, nor yet the second. The reckoning starts from the third offence. And if his iniquities, from the third onwards, are found to exceed his merits, the first two sins are also included in the demerits and he is judged for all of them. XI. But if his merits and iniquities—counting from the third offence—are found to balance, then all his iniquities are cancelled, one after another. The third is regarded as if it had been the first, the first two having already been forgiven. Then the fourth is regarded as if it had been the first, the third having been forgiven; and so on to the last. XII. This applies to an individual, as it is said, ""Lo, all these things does God do; twice, yea, thrice with a man"" (Job. 33:29). As to a community, (punishment for) their first offence as will as for their second and third, is suspended, as it is said ""For three transgressions of Israel,—yea, for four, I will not reverse it"" (Amos. 2:6). When account is taken of the merits and demerits of a community, their sins are reckoned from the fourth onwards, after the manner already described. XIII. As to those who belong to the intermediate class, if among half of an individual's deeds which constitute offences there is included the sin of never having put on phylacteries,<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Wilfully and in a spirit of contempt.</i> he is judged according to his sins but will have a portion in the world to come. So too, all wicked persons whose iniquities exceed their merits are judged according to their sins and have a portion in the world to come; for all Israelites, notwithstanding that they have sinned, have a portion in the life hereafter, as it is said, ""Thy people shall all be righteous, they shall inherit the land for ever"" (Isaiah. 60:21). The expression <i>land</i> is a metaphor for the land of life, that is, the world to come. And so too, the saints among the gentile peoples have a portion in the world to come."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.6","6. XIV. The following have no portion in the world to come, but are cut off and perish, and for their great wickedness and sinfulness are condemned for ever and ever. Heretics and Epicureans;<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** <span dir=""rtl"">,אפיקורום</span> literally a follower of the freethinking school of Epicurus; extended scoffing sceptics.</i> those who deny the Torah, the resurrection of the dead or the coming of the Redeemer; apostates; those who cause a multitude to sin, and those who secede from the ways of the community; any one who commits transgressions like Jehoiakim, in high handed fashion and openly; informers; those who terrorise a community, not for a religious purpose; murderers and slanderers, and one who obliterates the physical mark of his Jewish origin."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.7","7. XV. Five Classes are termed Heretics; he who says that there is no God and the world has no ruler; he who says that there is a ruling power but that it is vested in two or more persons; he who says there is one ruler, but that He is a body and has form; he who denies that He alone is the First Cause and Rock of the Universe; likewise, he who renders worship to any one beside Him, to serve as a mediator between the human being and the Lord of the Universe. Whoever belongs to any of these five classes is termed a heretic."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.8","8. XVI. Three Classes are called Epicureans:<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** <span dir=""rtl"">,אפיקורום</span> literally a follower of the freethinking school of Epicurus; extended scoffing sceptics.</i> he who denies the reality of prophecy and maintains that there is no knowledge which emanates from the Creator and directly reaches the human mind; he who denies the prophecy of Moses, our teacher; and he who asserts that the Creator has no cognizance of the deeds of the children of men. Each of these classes consists of Epicureans. XVII. Three Classes are deniers of the Torah; he who says that the Torah is not of divine origin—even if he says of one verse, or of a single word, that Moses said it, of himself,<sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">*** Without divine authority.</i>—is a denier of the Torah; likewise, he who denies its interpretation, that is, the Oral Law, and repudiates its reporters, as Zadok and Boethus did; he who says that the Creator changed one commandment for another, and that this Torah, although of divine origin, is now obsolete, as the Nazarenes and Moslems assert. Everyone belonging to any of these classes is a denier of the Torah."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.9","9. XVIII. There are two classes of apostates—an apostate with respect to the violation of a single precept, and an apostate with respect to the whole Torah. The former is a person who has determined to violate a certain precept, commits the transgression habitually and has become notorious for it. Even if it is one of the lighter sins, as, for instance, if a person wears garments ""of diverse sorts"" (a mixture of wool and flax) (Deut. 22:11) or ""rounds the corner of his head"" (Lev. 19:27), doing so habitually, so that it appears that the precept is regarded by him as no longer binding, he is an apostate in regard to that particular observance, provided that he acted in a provocative spirit. An apostate with respect to the whole Torah is one, for example, who at a time of religious persecution becomes converted to the idolaters' religion, clings to them, saying, ""what advantage is it to me to adhere to the people of Israel, who are of low estate and persecuted. Better for me to join these nations who are powerful."" A person who acts thus is an apostate in respect to the whole Torah."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.10","10. XIX. Those who cause the multitude to sin, include one who induces others to sin, whether in a great matter, like Jeroboam, Zadok and Boethus, or in a light matter, even if he only induces them to nullify the observance of an affirmative precept; and any one who coerces others to sin, like Manasseh who put Israelites to death and so forced the people into idolatry; or deceives others and leads them astray."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.11","11. XX. One who separates himself from the Community, even if he does not commit a transgression but only holds aloof from the congregation of Israel, does not fulfill religious precepts in common with his people, shows himself indifferent when they are in distress, does not observe their fast, but goes his own way, as if he were one of the gentiles and did not belong to the Jewish people—such a person has no portion in the world to come. XXI. He, who, like Jehoiakim, commits transgressions arrogantly, whether these are light or grave offences, has no portion in the world to come. Such a one is called a shameless transgressor, because he exhibits effrontery and shamelessness and is unabashed by the words of the Torah."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.12","12. XXII. There are two classes of informers: one who delivers a coreligionist into the power of a heathen, who will put him to death or assault him; and one who delivers the property of a coreligionist to a heathen or to a despot, who is like a heathen. Both classes of informers have no portion in the world to come."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.13","13. XXIII. The terrorisers of a community, not for the sake of God, are those who rule a congregation arbitrarily so that all fear and are afraid of them—their aim, like that of the heathen kings, being to advance their own glory and interests but not to promote the glory of God."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.3.14","14. XXIV. All these twenty four classes which we have enumerated, even if they are Israelites, have no portion in the world to come. There are transgressions less grave than those mentioned, concerning which, however, the sages said that whoever habitually commits them will have no portion in the world to come. One should therefore avoid, and beware of such transgressors. XXV. They are one who gives another a nickname, calls another by his nickname, puts him to shame in public, seeks honour by another person's humiliation, contemns scholars or one's teachers, treats the festivals with contempt, desecrates things sacred. XXVI. When it is said that one who commits any of these sins has no portion in the world to come, the statement is to be understood as only applying to the sinner who dies impenitent. But if he repented of his wickedness and expired while still penitent, he is of those who will have a portion in the world to come; for there is nothing that stands in the way of repentance. Even if a person, throughout his life, denied the essential principle of religion and repented at the end, he will have a portion in the world to come; as it is said ""Peace, Peace to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith the Lord, and I will heal him"" (Is. 57:19). XXVII. All wicked persons, transgressors, apostates and the like, who come back penitent, whether openly or secretly, are accepted, as it is said, ""Return, ye backsliding children"" (Jer. 3:22). Even if one is still a backslider—since he only returns in secret and not openly—he is accepted if he repents."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.4.1","1. Twenty-four things hinder repentance. Four of them constitute grave offences. If one commits any of them, the Holy One, blessed be He, does not give him an opportunity to repent because of the enormity of his sin. Such sinners are the following: 1) He who leads a community to sin, and under this category comes one who prevents a community from fulfilling a religious duty; 2) he who turns his fellow-man from the good to the evil way, as, for instance, the seducer and the enticer (Deut. 13:3); 3) he who sees his son falling into vicious courses and does not check him. As the son is under his father's control, had the latter checked him, he would have renounced his evil course; hence, the father is considered to have induced his son to sin. Included in this category is any one who is able to check others,—an individual or a community—and does not do so, but permits them to stumble; 4) he who says, ""I will sin and then repent"". Included in this category is he who says, ""I will sin, and the Day of Atonement will secure my forgiveness""."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.4.2","2. II. Among those (twenty-four things), there are five offences which close the ways of repentance to those who commit them. Such sinners are the following: 1) He who separates himself from the community, because, when they repent, he will not be with them, and will therefore have no part in the merit they acquire; 2) he who opposes the <i>dicta</i> of the sages, because his opposition induces him to separate himself from them and he will consequently remain in ignorance of the ways of repentance; 3) he who makes mock of the divine precepts, for, since in his eyes they are contemptible, he will not eagerly seek them nor fulfil them; and if he does not fulfil them, how can he acquire merit ? 4) He who contemns his teachers; for such conduct will lead to his being thrust forth and expelled, as happened to Gehazi (II. Kings 5:27); and when he is expelled, he will find no one to teach him and show him the way of truth; 5) he who hates rebukes, since he does not leave himself a way to return, for it is rebuke that brings about repentance. When a person is told of his faults and is put to shame on their account, he repents, as it is written in the Torah, ""Remember, do not forget…. ye have been rebellious"" (Deut. 9:7); ""But the Lord hath not given you a heart to understand"" ((Deut. 29:3); ""O foolish people and unwise"" (Deut. 32:6). III.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* The Hebrew Manuscript has <span dir=""rtl"">ד</span> at the beginning of this paragraph and also of the next paragraph, and heads the following paragraph with <span dir=""rtl"">ו</span> instead of <span dir=""rtl"">ה</span>.</i> Thus too, Isaiah rebuked Israel and said, ""O sinful nation""….. (Is. 1:4); ""The ox knoweth his owner……"" (Is. 1:3); ""Because I know that thou art obstinate"" (Is. 48:4). And indeed God commanded him to rebuke sinners, as it is said, ""Cry aloud, spare not"" (Is. 58:1). Thus too, all the prophets rebuked Israel till they repented. Hence it is necessary to appoint in every community a great scholar, advanced in years, God-fearing from his youth and beloved by the people, to rebuke the multitude and cause them to repent. But he who hates rebukes will not go to the exhorter nor hear his words, and will therefore persist in his sins which seem good in his eyes."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.4.3","3. IV. Among those (twenty four things), there are five offences of such a nature that he who commits them cannot possibly return in perfect repentance, because they are sins against one's fellow-man and the sinner does not know to whom he has to make restitution, or of whom he has to ask pardon. Sinners of this class are the following: 1) He who curses a multitude, and not an individual of whom he might ask forgiveness; 2) he who shares with a thief, since he does not know who is the owner of the stolen property, the thief stealing from many persons and bringing him the stolen articles which he receives; furthermore, because the receiver encourages the thief and induces him to sin; 3) he who finds lost property and does not proclaim it, so as to restore it to its owner; after a time, when he repents, he does not know whom to restore it to; 4) he who despoils the poor, orphans or widows; for these people are in a pitiable condition, they are not well known, they emigrate from one city to another where they have no acquaintance, so that the wrongdoer cannot ascertain to whom the despoiled goods belong and should be restored; 5) he who takes bribes to prevert judgment; since he does not know how far his judgment has been perverted, nor the full extent of the consequences, so that he might make amends, for he will find excuses<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** The judge will say ""I have decided justly"" (so explained in the Keseph Mishnah).</i> for his conduct; furthermore, because he encourages the bribing ligitant and causes him to sin."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.4.4","4. V. Among those (twenty-four sins), there are five, concerning which it may be assumed that he who commits them will not repent of them; the reason being that they are regarded by most people as trivial, with the result that one sins and imagines that it is no sin. Offenders coming under this category are the following: 1) He who partakes of a meal that is insufficient for its owner. This is a minor<sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">*** Literally: ""dust of robbery"".</i> form of robbery; yet the guest imagines that he has not sinned and says (to himself) ""Did I eat aught without the owner's consent ?"" 2) he who uses a poor man's pledge. A poor man's pledge consists only of such articles as an axe or a plow, and the user says to himself: ""the articles have not been diminished; I have not robbed him"". 3) he who gazes at women whom it would be unlawful for him to marry, thinks that there is nothing wrong in it, and says to himself, ""Have I cohabited with her, or even drawn near to her ?""—and does not realise that the (lustful) look is a grave sin, for it leads to actual inchastity, as it is said, ""And that ye seek not after your heart and after your eyes"" (Num. 15:39). 4) he who seeks to obtain honour by disparaging another person and thinks to himself that this is no sin, since the other person is not present and has not suffered any shame. Moreover, the speaker did not actually shame him but only compared his own good deeds and wisdom with the other person's deeds or wisdom, so that it might be inferred that he himself is an honourable man, while the other is a contemptible fellow. 5) he who suspects the innocent, thinks to himself that he is not comitting a sin, and says, 'what have I done to him? Is there on my part anything more than a suspicion as to whether that person has done something or not ?' He does not however, realise that it is an iniquity, to regard a blameless man as possibly a transgressor."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.4.5","5. VI.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* In the Hebrew Manuscript, this is numbered</i> Belonging to the group, are five offences of such a nature that he who commits them will always be addicted to them and will find it hard to break away from them. Hence, a person should be on his guard lest he become habituated to them, seeing that they are all exceedingly pernicious habits. They are as follows: ""Tale-bearing, Evil Speech, Choleric Temper, Evil Thoughts; keeping company with a wicked person, for thus one learns his ways which become impressed on the heart. So Solomon said: ""But the companion of fools shall be broken"" (Prov. 13:20). In the laws dealing with moral dispositions, we have put together the qualities that all men should cultivate; how much more then, should the penitent do so."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.4.6","6. All offences enumerated above and their like, though they hinder repentance, do not prevent it. If a person repents of them, he is accepted as a penitent, and will have a portion in the world to come."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.5.1","1. Free Will is bestowed on every human being. If one desires to turn towards the good way and be righteous, he has the power to do so. If one wishes to turn towards the evil way and be wicked, he is at liberty to do so. And thus is it written in the Torah, ""Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil"" (Gen. 3:22)—which means that the human species had become unique in the world—there being no other species like it in the following respect, namely, that man, of himself and by the exercise of his own intelligence and reason, knows what is good and what is evil, and there is none who can prevent him from doing that which is good or that which is evil. And since this is so (there is reason to fear) ""lest he put forth his hand etc."" (ibid.)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.5.2","2. II. Let not the notion, expressed by foolish gentiles and most of the senseless folk among Israelites, pass through your mind that at the beginning of a person's existence, the Almighty decrees that he is to be either righteous or wicked. This is not so. Every human being may become righteous like Moses, our teacher, or wicked like Jeroboam; wise or foolish, merciful or cruel; niggardly or generous; and so with all other qualities. III. There is no one that coerces him or decrees what he is to do, or draws him to either of the two ways; but every person turns to the way which he desires, spontaneously and of his own volition. Thus Jeremiah said, ""out of the mouth of the Most High, proceedeth not evil and good"" (Lam. 3:38); that is to say, the Creator does not decree either that a man shall be good or that he shall be wicked. IV. Accordingly it follows that it is the sinner who has inflicted injury on himself; and he should therefore weep for, and bewail what he has done to his soul—how he has mistreated it. This is expressed in the next verse, ""Wherefore doth a living man complain, a strong man, because of his sins"" (Lam. 3:39). The prophet continues: since liberty of action is in our hands and we have, of our free will, committed all these evils, it behoves us to return in a spirit of repentance, and forsake our wickedness, for we have the power to do so. This thought is expressed in the next verse, ""Let us search and try our ways, and return to the Lord"" (Lam. 3.40)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.5.3","3. V. This doctrine is an important principle, the pillar of the Law and the Commandment, as it is said, ""see, I set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil"" (Deut. 30:15); and again it is written, 'Behold, I set before you this day, a blessing and a curse"" (Deut. 11:26). This means that the power is in your hands, and whatever a man desires to do among the things that human beings do, he can do, whether they are good or evil; and, because of this faculty, it is said, ""O that they had such a heart as this always"" (Deut. 5:26), which implies that the Creator neither puts compulsion on the children of men nor decrees that they should do either good, or evil, but it is all left to their discretion."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.5.4","4. VI. If God had decreed that a person should be either righteous or wicked, or if there were some force inherent in his nature which irresistibly drew him to a particular course, or to a special branch of knowledge, to special views or activities, as the foolish astrologers, out of their own fancy, pretend, how would the Almighty have charged us, through the prophets: 'Do this and do not do that, improve your ways, do not follow your wicked impulses', when, from the beginning of his existence, his destiny had already been decreed, or his innate constitution irresistibly drew him to that from which he could not set himself free ? What room would there be for the whole of the Torah ? By what right or justice could God punish the wicked or reward the righteous ? ""Shall not the Judge of all the earth act justly?"" (Gen. 18:25). VII. Do not, however, wonder: how can a man do whatever he desires, and act according to his discretion? Can aught in the world be done without the Master's Will and pleasure ? The Scripture itself says, ""Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that hath He done in heaven and on earth"" (Ps. 135:6). Know then that everything takes place according to His pleasure, notwithstanding that our acts are in our power. VIII. How so ? Just as it was the pleasure of the Creator that fire and air shall ascend, earth and water descend, and that the sphere shall revolve in a circle, and all other things in the Universe shall exist in their special ways which He desired, so it was His pleasure that Man should have liberty of will, and all his acts should be left to his discretion; that nothing should coerce him or draw him to aught, but that, of himself and by the exercise of his own mind which God had given him, he should do whatever it is in a man's power to do. IX. Hence, he is judged according to his deeds. If he does well, good is done to him; and if he does ill, evil is done to him. So the prophet says, ""This hath been of your doing"" (Mal. 1:9): ""Yea, they have chosen their own ways"" (Is. 66:3). On this theme Solomon said, ""Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth…. but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment"" (Eccles. 11:9); that is to say, realise that what you do is in your power, and that you will have to render an account."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.5.5","5. X. Perchance you will say, ""Does not the Almighty know everything that will be before it happens""? He either knows that this person will be righteous or wicked, or He does not know. If He knows that he will be righteous, it is impossible that he should not be righteous; and if you say that He knows that he will be righteous and yet it is possible for him to be wicked, then He does not know the matter clearly. XI. As to the solution of this problem, understand that ""the measure thereof is longer than the earth and wider than the sea"" (Job. 11:9), and many important principles of the highest sublimity are connected with it. You, however, need only to know and comprehend what I am about to say. XII. In the Second Chapter of the laws relating to the fundamental principles of the Torah, we have already explained that God does not know with a knowledge external to Himself, like human beings whose knowledge and self are separate entities, but He, blessed be His Name, and His knowledge are One. This, the human intellect cannot clearly apprehend. And just as it is not in human power to apprehend or discover the Creator's Real Essence, as it is said, ""For there shall no man see Me and live"" (Ex. 33:20), so it is not in human power to apprehend or discover the Creator's knowledge. So the prophet said, ""For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways"" (Is. 55:8). This being the case, we lack the capacity to know how God knows all creatures and their activities. XIII. Yet we do know beyond doubt that a human being's activities are in his own hands and the Almighty neither draws him on, nor decrees that he should act thus or not act thus. It is not religious tradition alone by which this is known. It is also supported by clear proofs furnished by science. Hence, it is said in the Prophetic writings that a man will be judged for all his deeds, according to his deeds, whether they be good or evil. And this is the principle on which all the words of Prophecy depend."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.6.1","1. There are many verses in the Pentateuch and in the Prophets which seem to contradict this fundamental doctrine. And they lead most people astray and make them think that God decrees that a person shall do good or evil, and that a man's heart is not under his control, to incline him in whichever direction he pleases. I will therefore expound an important principle by which you will learn the meaning of those verses. II. When an individual sins or the inhabitants of a country sin, and the sinner commits an offence, consciously and voluntarily, as above stated, it is proper that he be punished. God knows the way in which punishment should be exacted. In the case of some sins, justice requires that the sinner should be punished for his sin in this world, corporally or pecuniarily or through his little children; for a man's little children, who have as yet no understanding and have not arrived at the age of religious obligation, are their father's quasi-property, and the text ""Every man<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Every <i>man</i> but not a child.</i> shall be put to death for his own sin"" (Deut. 24:16) implies that one is not personally liable till he is an adult. III. Again, there are sins where justice requires that the punishment be inflicted in the life hereafter and the transgressor suffers no hurt here on earth. Other sins again there are, for which the penalty is exacted here and hereafter."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.6.2","2. The foregoing only applies in case the sinner has not repented. But if he repented, repentance serves as a shield against punishment. And as one sins, prompted by one's own mind and of his free will, so one repents, prompted by one's mind and will."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.6.3","3. IV. A man may commit so great a sin or such numerous sins that justice requires of the true judge, as the penalty to be exacted from this particular sinner for the sins, committed by him voluntarily and of his own mind, that repentance shall be withheld from him and liberty to turn from his wickedness shall not be accorded him, so that he may die and perish in the sins which he committed. So God saith through Isaiah, ""Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and close their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn and be healed"" (Is. 6:10); and thus it is said, ""But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against His people, till there was no remedy"" (II. Book of Chron. 36:16). This means that they sinned, of their own will, and multiplied transgressions to such an extent that they incurred the penalty of having repentance, which is the remedy for sin, withheld from them. V. Hence also, it is written in the Pentateuch, ""And I will harden Pharaoh's heart"" (Ex. 4:21). Because Pharaoh sinned on his own impulse and ill-treated the Israelites who sojourned in his land, as is said ""Come let us deal wisely with them…."" (Ex. 1:10), justice required that repentance should be withheld from him till retribution had been visited upon him. The Holy One, blessed be He, accordingly hardened his heart. VI. But why did He send him a message through Moses, bidding him 'release the Israelites and repent', when He had already told him 'thou wilt not release them', as it is said, ""But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not fear the Lord God"" (Ex. 9:30), ""But in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, (to show thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth)"" (Ex. 9:16)? The purpose was to instruct the inhabitants of the world<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* This purpose is indicated in the verse last quoted (Ex. 9:16).</i> that when the Almighty withholds repentance from the sinner, he cannot return, but will die in his wickedness which he had originally committed of his own will. VII. So Sihon, because of his iniquities, incurred the penalty of having repentance withheld from him, as it is said, ""for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day"" (Deut. 2:30). Thus too, because of the Canaanites' abominations, God withheld repentance from them till they waged war against Israel, as it is said, ""For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, to come against Israel, in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed"" Josh. 11:20). So with the Israelites in the days of Elijah; because they transgressed much, God withheld repentance from those who multiplied their transgressions, as it is said, ""For thou didst turn their heart backward"" (I. Kings 18:37); this means 'Thou has withheld repentance from them'. VIII. To sum up, God did not decree that Pharaoh should ill-treat Israel, or Sihon sin in his land, or that the Canaanites should commit abominations, or that Israel should worship idols. All of them sinned by their own volition; and all accordingly incurred the penalty that repentance should be withheld from them."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.6.4","4. IX. And thus the prophets and the righteous beseech the Almighty, in their prayers, to help them to the way of truth, as David said, ""Teach me, O Lord, thy way"", (Ps. 86:11); that is, 'May my sins not keep the way of truth from me, that I may learn from it Thy way and the Unity of Thy Name'. So also his prayer, ""let a noble spirit uphold me"" (Ps. 51:14) means, 'Suffer my spirit to accomplish its desire, and may not my sins cause repentance to be withheld from me, but let me have liberty, till I return and understand and know the way of truth'. Every text similar to the above can be explained in the same way."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.6.5","5. X. What is meant by David's utterance, ""Good and upright is the Lord; therefore He will teach sinners in the way; He will guide the meek in judgment and will teach the meek His way"" (Ps. 25:8)? It refers to the fact that God sent them prophets to teach them the ways of the Lord and bring them back in repentance; furthermore, that He endowed them with the capacity of learning and understanding. For it is characteristic of every human being that, when his interest is engaged in the ways of wisdom and righteousness, he longs for these ways and is eager to follow them. Thus the sages say, ""Whoever comes to purify himself receives aid""; that is, he will find himself helped in his endeavour. XI. But is it not written in the Torah ""And they shall serve them, and they shall afflict them"" (Gen. 15:13)? Did not then the Almighty decree that the Egyptians should do evil ? It is also written, ""And this people will rise up and go astray after the foreign gods of the land"" (Deut. 31:16). Did He not decree that Israel should worship idols ? Why then did He punish them ? (The answer is) that He did not decree concerning any particular individual that that individual should be the one to go astray. Any one of those who went astray and worshipped idols, had he not desired to commit idolatry, need not have done so. The Creator only instructed Moses as to what the future course of history would be, as one might say, 'This people will have among them righteous and wicked persons'. A wicked man has no right, on that account, to say that it had been decreed that he should be wicked, because the Almighty had informed Moses that among Israel there would be wicked men, just as the text, ""For the poor shall never cease out of the land"" (Deut. 15:11) (does not imply that any particular individual is destined to be poor). XII. So too with the Egyptians: Every one of those Egyptians who oppressed and ill-treated the Israelites could have refrained from doing so, had he not wished to hurt them. For God did not make a decree concerning any specific individual but only informed Abraham that his seed would be subjected to servitude in a land that was not theirs. We have already stated that it is beyond human power to understand the way in which God has cognizance of future events."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.1","1. Since every human being, as we have explained, has free will, a man should strive to repent, (make verbal confession of his sins<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* The Hebrew of the phrase in brackets <span dir=""rtl"">ולהתודות בפיו טִחטאיו</span> is not in the Manuscript, but in the printed editions.</i>) and renounce them, so that he may die penitent and thus be worthy of life in the world to come."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.2","2. II. A man should always regard himself as if his death were iminent and think that he may die this very hour, while still in a state of sin. He should therefore repent of his sins immediately and not say, 'When I grow old I shall repent', for he may die before he becomes old. So Solomon, in his wisdom, said, ""Let thy garments be always white, and oil on thy head not be lacking"" (Eccles. 9:8)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.3","3. III. Do not say that one need only repent of sinful deeds such as fornication, robbery and theft. Just as a man needs to repent of these sins involving acts, so he needs to investigate and repent of any evil dispositions that he may have, such as hot temper, hatred, jealousy, quarrelling,<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** <span dir=""rtl"">התחתרו</span> Omitted in printed editions.</i> scoffing, eager pursuit of wealth or honours, greediness in eating, and so on. Of all these faults one should repent. They are graver than sinful acts; for, when one is addicted to them it is difficult to give them up. And thus it is said, ""Let the wicked forsake his way and the man of iniquity his thoughts"" (Is. 55:7)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.4","4. IV. Let not the penitent suppose that he is kept far away from the degree attained by the righteous, because of the iniquities and sins that he had committed. This is not so. He is beloved by the Creator, desired by Him, as if he had never sinned. Moreover his reward is great; since, though having tasted sin, he renounced it and overcame his evil passions. The sages say, ""Where penitents stand, the completely righteous cannot stand"". This means, that the degree attained by penitents is higher than that of those who had never sinned, the reason being that the former have had to put forth a greater effort to subdue their passions than the latter."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.5","5. V. All the prophets charged the people concerning repentance. Only through repentance will Israel be redeemed, and the Torah already offered the assurance that Israel will, in the closing period of his exile, finally repent, and thereupon be immediately redeemed, as it is said, ""And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt take it to heart among all the nations, whither the Lord, thy God hath driven thee, and shalt return unto the Lord, thy God, and hearken to His voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have mercy upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the Lord, thy God, hath scattered thee"" (Deut. 30:1-3)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.6","6. VI. Great is repentance, for it brings men near to the Divine Presence, as it is said, ""Return, O Israel, unto the Lord, thy God"" (Hos. 14:2). Again, it is said, ""And ye have not returned unto Me, saith the Lord"" (Amos 4:6). Further, ""If thou return, O Israel, to Me shalt thou return"" (Jer. 4:1), which means 'If thou returnest in repentance, thou wilt cleave to Me'. VII. Repentance brings near those who are far away. But yesterday this person was odious before God, abhorred, estranged, an abomination. To-day he is beloved, desirable, near (to God), a friend. So you find that the same expression with which God thrusts sinners away from Him, He employs to bring the penitent near to Him, whether they are individuals or communities, as it is said, ""And instead of that which was said unto them: 'Ye are not my people', it shall be said unto them: 'Ye are children of the living God' "" (Hos. 2:1). Of Jeconiah, while he was wicked, it was said, ""Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days"" (Jer. 22:30); ""Though Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were a signet upon my right hand, (yet would I pluck thee thence)"" (Jer. 22:24). But after he had in his exile repented, it is said of his son, Zerubbabel, ""In that day, saith the Lord of Hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant, and will make thee as a signet, saith the Lord of hosts"" (Haggai 2:23)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.7","7. VIII. How exalted is the degree of repentance ? But last night a certain individual was separated from the Lord, God of Israel, as it is said, ""Your iniquities were making a separation between you and your God"" (Is. 59:2). He cries aloud and is not answered, as it is said, ""Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear"" (Is. 1:15). He fulfils religious precepts and they are flung back in his face, as it is said, ""who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts?"" (Is. 1:12); ""Oh that there were even one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on my altar in vain; I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand"" (Malachi 1:10); ""Add your burnt offerings unto your sacrifice and eat flesh"" (Jer. 7:21). IX. Today, the same individual (having repented) is closely attached to the Divine Presence, as it is said, ""And ye that cleave unto the Lord, your God, are alive, everyone of you this day"" (Deut. 4:4). He cries and is immediately answered, as it is said, ""And it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer"" (Is. 65:24). He fulfils religious precepts tnd they are accepted with pleasure and with joy, as it is said, ""For God hath already accepted thy works"" (Eccles. 9:7). Yet more, they are eagerly desired, as it is said, ""Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to the Lord as in the days of old and as in ancient years"" (Malachi 3:4)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.7.8","8. X. The right way for penitents is to be exceedingly humble and meek. If fools taunt them with their former deeds and say to them, 'But last night thou didst act thus and thus; last night, thou wast saying this and that', they should not be unpleasantly affected by them, but should listen and rejoice, realizing that this will be accounted a merit unto them. For when they are ashamed of their past deeds and humiliated because of them, their merit is increased and their worth enhanced. XI. It is however a grievous sin to say to a penitent 'Remember thy former doings', or to recall them in his presence, so as to shame him, or refer to similar incidents or topics, in order to remind him of what he had done. All this is forbidden and comes under the category of vexing another in words, against which the Torah warns us in the text ""Ye shall not vex one another"" (Lev. 25:17)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.1","1. The good reserved for the righteous is life in the world to come,—a life which is immortal, a good without evil. Thus is it written in the Torah ""that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days"" (Deut. 22:7); the traditional interpretation of which is as follows: ""that it may be well with thee"", in a world altogether good; ""that thou mayest prolong thy days"", in a world unending, that is, the world to come. II. The reward of the righteous is that they will attain this bliss and abide in this state of happiness; the punishment of the wicked is that they will not attain this life but will be cut off and die. He who does not attain this life will be dead, in the sense that he will never live again but will be cut off in his wickedness and perish like the brute beast. This is the penalty of <i>excision,</i> referred to in the Torah, as it is written, ""That soul shall utterly be cut off, his iniquity shall be upon him"" (Num. 15:31): which has been traditionally interpreted as follows: ""'cut off', in this world; ""utterly cut off', in the world to come"". This means that that soul, after its separation from the body (at the close of its existence) on earth, will not attain life in the world to come but will be cut off from that life also."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.2","2. III. In the world to come, there is nothing corporeal, and no material substance; there are only souls of the righteous without bodies,—like the ministering angels. And since in that world there are no bodies, there is neither eating there, nor drinking, nor aught that human beings need on earth. None of the conditions occur there which are incident to physical bodies in this world, such as sitting, standing, sleep, death, grief, merriment, etc. So the ancient sages said, ""In the life hereafter, there is no eating, no drinking, no connubial intercourse, but the righteous sit with their crowns on their heads and enjoy the radiance of the Shechinah""<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Divine Presence.</i>. IV. This passage clearly indicates that as there is no eating or drinking there, there is no physical body hereafter. The phrase ""the righteous sit""—is allegorical and means that the souls of the righteous exist there without labour or fatigue. The phrase ""their crowns on their heads"" refers to the knowledge they have acquired, and for the sake of which they have attained life in the world to come. This is their crown, in the same sense as where Solomon says ""with the crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him"" (Song of Songs 3:11). And just as in the text ""Everlasting joy shall be upon their heads"" (Is. 35:10), joy is not to be understood as a material substance that actually rests on the head, so 'the Crown', of which the sages here speak, is not to be taken literally but refers to knowledge. V. And what is the meaning of the sages' statement: ""they enjoy the radiance of the Shechinah""<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Divine Presence.</i>? It means that the righteous attain to a knowledge and realisation of the truth concerning God to which they had not attained while they were in the murky and lowly body."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.3","3. VI. The soul, whenever mentioned in this connection, is not the vital element requisite for bodily existence, but that form of soul which is identical with the intelligence which apprehends the Creator, as far as it is able, and apprehends other abstract concepts and other things. It is the psychic form, which we expounded in the Fourth Chapter of the Laws concerning the fundamental principles of the Torah. And it is this which, in this connection, is called Soul. VII. That life, as it is immortal,—death being only incidental to the body, which does not exist in the hereafter—is called 'the bond of life', as it is said, ""but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bond of life; and the souls of thine enemies, them he shall sling out….."" (I. Sam. 25:29). And this is a recompense than which there is none higher; a bliss beyond which there is nothing more blissful. And for this, all the prophets yearned."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.4","4. How many names have been metaphorically applied to it: 'The mountain of the Lord', 'His holy place', 'the way of holiness', 'the holy way', 'the courtyards of the Lord', 'the tent of the Lord', 'the beauty of the Lord', the temple of the Lord', 'the house of the Lord', 'the gate of the Lord'! The sages metaphorically call this bliss, destined for the righteous, 'the Banquet'. Its general name is 'the World to Come'."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.5","5. VIII. The severest retribution beyond which punishment can no further go, is that the soul shall be cut off and not attain the life hereafter, as it is said, ""That soul shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him""<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** Literally ""her iniquity shall be upon her""—referring to the soul.</i> (Num. 15:31). This destruction it is to which the prophets metaphorically apply the terms 'the Pit of destruction', 'Abaddon', 'Tophet', 'Leech'; and all other expressions which connote cessation and destruction are applied to it, because it is a ruin that is irreparable and a loss which is irrecoverable."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.6","6. IX. Possibly you may esteem this boon (of life hereafter) lightly, and imagine that the only reward for fulfilling religious precepts and walking consistently in the ways of truth is to enjoy good food and drink; to have intercourse with 'beautiful forms'; to wear fine linen and brocade; to dwell in palaces of ivory; to be served on gold and silver plate and enjoy similar things, as indeed those foolish and silly Arabs, who lead dissolute lives, imagine. X. The wise and intelligent know, however, that all these pleasures are exaggerated and inane, and there is no profit in them. They are regarded by us as a great boon because we are beings with physical bodies and material frames which have need of all these things. The soul only desires and longs for them because they are necessary to the body, and enable it to attain its needs and maintain its health; and when the body ceases to exist, all these things become null and void. XI. As to the blissful state of the soul in the world to come, there is no way on earth in which we can comprehend or know it. For in this earthly existence we only have knowledge of physical pleasure; and it is for this that we long. But the bliss of the life hereafter is exceedingly great, and can only metaphorically be compared with earthly enjoyments. In reality, however, there is no comparison between the bliss of the soul in the life hereafter and the gratification afforded to the body on earth by food and drink. That spiritual bliss is unsearchable and beyond compare. So David said, ""How great is Thy goodness which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee"" (Ps. 31:19)."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.7","7. How David yearned and longed for the life in the world to come, as it is said, ""Had I not believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living'…. (Ps. 27:13). XII. The ancient sages taught us that a clear comprehension of the bliss in the life hereafter is unattainable to any man. None but God knows its grandeur, beauty and power. All the boons which the prophets prophesied to Israel only refer to material things that Israel will enjoy in the days of King Messiah, when sovereignty will be restored to Israel. XIII. But as for the bliss in the world to come, nought can be compared with, or likened to it. And the prophets did not depict it, so as not to depreciate it by their imaginary picture. Thus Isaiah said, ""Eye hath not seen beside Thee, O God, what He prepareth for him that waiteth for Him"" (Is. 64:3); that is, the bliss which neither the eye of the prophet nor any one else but God, hath seen, He hath prepared for the man who waits for Him. The sages say, ""All the prophets only prophesied concerning the days of the Messiah. But the world to come, ""no eye hath seen but Thine, O God""."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.8.8","8. XIV. The reason why the sages styled it 'The World to Come' is not because it is not now in existence and will only come into being when this world shall have passed away. That is not so. The world to come now exists, as it is said, ""which Thou hast treasured up (for them that fear Thee), which Thou hast wrought (for them that trust in Thee before the children of men"") (Ps. 31:19-20). It is called the World to Come, only because human beings will enter into it at a time subsequent to the life of the present world in which we now exist with body and soul,—and this existence comes first."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.9.1","1. It is known that the reward for the fulfilment of the commandments and the good to which we will attain if we have kept the way of the Lord, as prescribed in the Law, is life in the World to Come, as it is said, ""That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days"" (Deut. 22:7), while the retribution exacted from the wicked who have abandoned the ways of righteousness prescribed in the Torah is excision, as it is said, ""that soul shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him"" (Num. 15:31). What then is the meaning of the statement found everywhere in the Torah that 'if ye obey, it will happen to you thus; if ye do not obey, it will be otherwise'; and all these happenings will take place in this world, such as war and peace; sovereignty and subjection; residence in the Promised Land, and exile; prosperity in one's activities and failure, and all the other things predicted in the words of the Covenant (Lev. ch. 26. Deut. ch. 28)? II. All those promises were (once) truly (fulfilled) and will again be so. When we fulfil all the commandments of the Torah, all the good things of this world will come to us. When however we transgress the precepts, the evils that are written in the Torah will befall us. But nevertheless, those good things are not the final reward for the fulfilment of the commandments, nor are those evils the last penalty exacted from one who transgresses all the commandments. These matters are to be understood as follows: III. The Holy One, blessed be He, gave us this Law—a tree of lfie. Whoever fulfills what is written therein and knows it with a complete and correct knowledge will attain thereby life in the World to Come. According to the greatness of his deeds and abundance of his knowledge will be the measure in which he will attain that life. He has further promised us in the Torah, that, if we observe its behests joyously and cheerfully, and continually meditate on its wisdom, He will remove from us the obstacles that hinder us in its observance, such as sickness, war, famine, and other calamities; and will bestow upon us all the material benefits which will strengthen our ability to fulfil the Law, such as plenty, peace, abundance of silver and gold. IV. Thus we will not be engaged, all our days, in providing for our bodily needs, but will have leisure to study wisdom and fulfil the commandment, and thus attain life in the World to Come. Hence, after the assurance of material benefits, it is said in the Torah, ""And it shall be righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all this commandment before the Lord, our God, as He hath commanded us"" (Deut. 6:25). V. So too, He taught us in the Torah that if we deliberately forsake it and occupy ourselves with temporal follies, as the text says, ""But Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked"" (Deut. 32:15),—the true Judge will deprive the forsakers of all those material benefits which only served to encourage them to be recalcitrant, and will send upon them all the calamities that will prevent their attaining the life hereafter, so that they will perish in their wickedness. This is expressed by the Torah in the text: ""Because thou didst not serve the Lord, thy God, with joyfulness and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things, therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy whom the Lord shall send against thee""<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* The order of the sentences in this text, correctly given as it is in the Torah, is reversed in the Hebrew manuscript, possibly not to end with calamitous maledictions.</i> (Deut. 28:47-48). VI. Hence, all those benedictions and maledictions are to be explained as follows: If you have served God with joy and observed His way, He will bestow upon you those blessings and avert from you those curses, so that you will have leisure to become wise in the Torah and occupy yourselves therewith, and thus attain life hereafter, and then it will be well with you in the world which is entirely blissful and you will enjoy length of days in an existence which is everlasting. So you will enjoy both worlds,—a happy life on earth leading to the life in the World to Come. For if wisdom is not acquired and good deeds are not performed here, there will be nought meriting a recompense hereafter, as it is said, ""for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave"" (Eccles. 9:10). VII. But if you have forsaken the Lord and have erred in eating, drinking, fornication, and similar things, He will bring upon you all those curses and withhold from you all those blessings till your days will end in confusion and terror, and you will have neither the free mind nor the healthy body requisite for the fulfilment of the commandments so that you will suffer perdition in the life hereafter and will thus have lost both worlds,—for when one is troubled here on earth with diseases, war or famine, he does not occupy himself with the acquisition of wisdom or the performance of religious precepts by which life hereafter is gained."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.9.2","2. VIII. Hence, all Israelites, their prophets and sages, longed for the advent of Messianic times, that they might have relief from the wicked tyranny that does not permit them properly to occupy themselves with the study of the Torah and the observance of the commandments; that they might have ease, devote themselves to getting wisdom, and thus attain to life in the World to Come. IX. For in those days, knowledge, wisdom and truth will increase, as it is said ""For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord"" (Is. 11:9), and it is said, ""They will no more teach everyone his brother and everyone his neighbour"" (Jer. 31:34), and further, ""I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh"" (Ezek 36:26). X. Because the King who will arise from the seed of David will possess more wisdom than Solomon and will be a great prophet, approaching Moses, our teacher<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* In the M.S. ""nearer than our teacher Moses"". <span dir=""rtl"">ונביא גדול הוא קרוב ממשה</span> This may be a scribal error, and should be corrected to <span dir=""rtl"">קרוב למשה</span></i>, he will teach the whole of the Jewish people and instruct them in the way of God; and all nations will come to hear him, as it is said, ""And at the end of days it shall come to pass that the Mount of the Lord's house shall be established as the top of the mountains"" (Micah 4:1, Is. 2:2). XI. The ultimate and perfect reward, the final bliss which will suffer neither interruption nor diminution is the life in the world to come. The Messianic era, on the other hand, will be realized in this world; which will continue in its normal course except that independent sovereignty will be restored to Israel. The ancient sages already said, ""The only difference between the present and the Messianic era is that political oppression will then cease."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.10.1","1. Let not a man say, 'I will observe the precepts of the Torah and occupy myself with its wisdom, in order that I may obtain all the blessings written in the Torah, or to attain life in the world to come; I will abstain from transgressions against which the Torah warns, so that I may be saved from the curses written in the Torah, or that I may not be cut off from life in the world to come.' II. It is not right to serve God after this fashion for whoever does so, serves Him out of fear. This is not the standard set by the prophets and sages. Only those serve God in this way, who are illiterate, women or children whom one trains to serve out of fear, till their knowledge shall have increased when they will serve out of love."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.10.2","2. III. Whoever serves God out of love, occupies himself with the study of the Law and the fulfilment of commandments and walks in the paths of wisdom, impelled by no external motive whatsoever, moved neither by fear of calamity nor by the desire to obtain material benefits; such a man does what is truly right because it is truly right, and ultimately, happiness comes to him as a result of his conduct. IV. This standard is indeed a very high one; not every sage attained to it. It was the standard of the patriarch Abraham whom God called His lover, because he served only out of love. It is the standard which God, through Moses, bids us achieve, as it is said, ""And thou shalt love the Lord, thy God"" (Deut. 6:5). When one loves God with the right love, he will straightway observe all the commandments out of love."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.10.3","3. V. What is the love of God that is befitting ? It is to love the Eternal with a great and exceeding love, so strong that one's soul shall be knit up with the love of God, and one should be continually enraptured by it, like a love-sick individual, whose mind is at no time free from his passion for a particular woman, the thought of her filling his heart at all times, when sitting down or rising up, when he is eating or drinking. Even intenser should be the love of God in the hearts of those who love Him. And this love should continually possess them, even as He commanded us in the phrase, ""with all thy heart and with all thy soul"" (Deut. 6:5). This, Solomon expressed allegorically in the sentence, ""for I am sick with love"" (Song of Songs 2:5). The entire Song of Songs is indeed an allegory descriptive of this love."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.10.4","4. VI. The ancient sages said; Peradventure, you will say, 'I will study Torah, in order that I may become rich, that I may be called Rabbi, that I may receive a reward in the world to come'. It is therefore said, ""To love the Lord"". Whatever you do, do is out of love only. VII. The text: ""(Happy is the man that feareth the Lord), that delighteth greatly in His commandments"" (Ps. 112:1) has been thus explained by the sages—""<i>In His commandments</i>—not in the reward for His commandments"". So too, the greatest sages were wont specifically to exhort those among their disciples who were understanding and intelligent ""Be not like servants who minister to their master, upon the condition of receiving a reward"" (Ethics of the Fathers 1:3). But it is proper to be like servants who serve their master not for the sake of receiving aught; but only because he is the master, it is right to serve him; that is, serve him out of love."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.10.5","5. VIII. Whoever engages in the study of the Torah, in order that he may receive a reward or avoid calamities is not studying the Torah for its own sake. Whoever occupies himself with the Torah, neither out of fear nor for the sake of recompense, but solely out of love for the Lord of the whole Earth who enjoined us to do so, is occupied with the Torah for its own sake. The sages however said, ""One should always engage in the study of the Torah, even if not for its own sake; for he who begins thus will end by studying it for its own sake"". IX. Hence, when instructing the young, women or the illiterate generally, we teach them to serve God out of fear or for the sake of reward, till their knowledge increases and they have attained a large measure of wisdom. Then we reveal to them this mystic truth, little by little, and train them by easy stages till they have grasped and comprehended it, and serve God out of love."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.10.6","6. X. It is known and certain that the love of God does not become closely knit in a man's heart till he is continuously and thoroughly possessed by it and gives up everything else in the world for it; as God commanded us, ""with all thy heart and with all thy soul"" (Deut. 6:5). One only loves God with the knowledge with which one knows Him. According to the knowledge, will be the love. If the former be little or much, so will the latter be little or much. XI. A person ought therefore to devote himself to the understanding and comprehension of those sciences and studies which will inform him concerning his Master, as far as it lies in human faculties to understand and comprehend—as indeed we have explained in the Laws of the Foundations of the Torah."

"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.10.8","The first book is completed with the help of the Almighty. The number of chapters in this book are forty-six; namely, laws of the fundamental principles of the Torah, ten chapters; laws of Moral Dispositions, seven chapters; laws of the Study of the Torah, seven chapters; laws of Idolatry, twelve chapters; laws of Repentance, ten chapters."
"LAWS OF REPENTANCE,.10.9",Blessed be the All-Merciful who hath aided us !
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.1.1","1. Every human being is characterised by numerous moral dispositions which differ from each other and are exceedingly divergent. One man is choleric, always irascible; another sedate, never angry; or, if he should become angry, is only slightly and very rarely so. One man is haughty to excess; another humble in the extreme. One is a sensualist whose lusts are never sufficiently gratified; another is so pure in soul that he does not even long for the few things that our physical nature needs. One is so greedy that all the money in the world would not satisfy him, as it is said, ""He who loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver"". (Eccles. 5:9). Another so curbs his desires that he is contented with very little, even with that which is insufficient, and does not bestir himself to obtain that which he really needs. One will suffer extreme hunger for the sake of saving, and does not spend the smallest coin without a pang, while another deliberately and wantonly squanders all his property. In the same way, men differ in other traits. There are, for example, the hilarious and the melancholy, the stingy and the generous, the cruel and the merciful, the timid and the stout-hearted, and so forth."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.1.2","2. Between any moral disposition and its extreme opposite, there are intermediate dispositions more or less removed from each other. Of all the various dispositions, some belong to one from the beginning of his existence and correspond to his physical constitution. Others are such that a particular individual's nature is favourably predisposed to them and prone to acquire them more rapidly than other traits. Others again are not innate, but have been either learnt from others, or are self-originated, as the result of an idea that has entered the mind or, having heard that a certain disposition is good for him and should be cultivated by him, one trained himself in it till it became part of his nature."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.1.3","3. To cultivate either extreme in any class of dispositions is not the right course nor is it proper for any person to follow or learn it. If a man finds that his nature tends or is disposed to one of these extremes, or if one has acquired and become habituated to it, he should turn back and improve, so as to walk in the way of good people, which is the right way."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.1.4","4. The right way is the mean in each group of dispositions common to humanity; namely, that disposition which is equally distant from the two extremes in its class, not being nearer to the one than to the other. Hence, our ancient sages exhorted us that a person should always evaluate his dispositions and so adjust them that they shall be at the mean between the extremes, and this will secure his physical health. Thus a man should not be choleric, easily moved to anger, nor be like the dead without feeling; but should aim at the happy medium; be angry only for a grave cause that rightly calls for indignation, so that the like shall not be done again. He will only desire that which the body absolutely needs and cannot do without, as it is said, ""The righteous eats, to satisfy himself"" (Prov. 13:25). He will only labour at his occupation to obtain what is necessary for his sustenance, as it is said, ""A little that a righteous man hath is better [than the riches of many wicked""] (Ps. 37:16). He will not be tight-fisted nor yet a spendthrift, but will bestow charity according to his means and give a suitable loan to whoever needs it. He will be neither frivolous and given to jesting, nor mournful and melancholy, but will rejoice all his days tranquilly and cheerfully. And so will he comport himself with regard to all his other dispositions. This is the way of the wise. Whoever observes in his dispositions the mean is termed wise."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.1.5","5. Whoever is particularly scrupulous and deviates somewhat from the exact mean in disposition, in one direction or the other, is called a saint. For example, if one avoids haughtiness to the utmost extent and is exceedingly humble, he is termed a saint, and this is the standard of saintliness. If one only departs from haughtiness as far as the mean, and is humble, he is called wise, —and this is the standard of wisdom. And so with all other dispositions. The ancient saints trained their dispositions away from the exact mean towards the extremes; in regard to one disposition in one direction; in regard to another in the opposite direction. This was supererogation. We are bidden to walk in the middle paths which are the right and proper ways, as it is said, ""and thou shalt walk in His ways"" (Deut. 28:9)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.1.6","6. In explanation of the text just quoted, the sages taught, ""Even as God is called gracious, so be thou gracious; Even as He is called merciful, so be thou merciful; even as He is called holy, so be thou holy"". Thus too the prophets described the Almighty by all the various attributes ""long-suffering and abounding in kindness, righteous and upright, perfect, mighty and powerful,"" and so forth, to teach us, that these qualities are good and right and that a human being should cultivate them, and thus imitate God, as far as he can."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.1.7","7. How shall a man train himself in these dispositions, so that they become ingrained? Let him practise again and again the actions prompted by those dispositions which are the mean between the extremes, and repeat them continually till they become easy and are no longer irksome to him, and so the corresponding dispositions will become a fixed part of his character. And as the Creator is called by these attributes, which constitute the middle path in which we are to walk, this path is called the Way of God and this is what the patriarch Abraham taught his children, as it is said ""For I love him, because he will charge his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord"" (Gen. 18:19). Whoever walks in this way secures for himsself happiness and blessing, as the text continues, ""In order that the Lord might bring upon Abraham that which He spoke concerning him"" (Gen. 18:19)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.2.1","1. To those who are sick in body, the bitter tastes as if it were sweet, and the sweet as if it were bitter. Among sick folk, some long and yearn for things unfit for food, such as earth and charcoal, and have an aversion to wholesome foods, like bread and meat—the perversity depending on the severity of the illness. Similarly, human beings whose souls are sick and love evil dispositions, and hate the way that is good and are too indolent to walk therein, and find it exceedingly irksome because of their sickness. And so Isaiah says of such people, ""O, they that say of evil that it is good, and of good that it is evil, that turn darkness into light and light into darkness, who take bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter"" (Is. 5:20). And of such it is also said, ""Who forsake the paths of integrity to walk in the ways of darkness"" (Prov. 2:13). What is the corrective for those that are sick in soul ? They should go to the wise who are physicians of the soul and they will heal their maladies by instructing them in the dispositions which they should acquire till they are restored to the right path. Of those who realise that their dispositions are bad and nevertheless do not resort to the wise to be cured, Solomon says, ""Wisdom and discipline, fools despise"" (Prov. 1:7)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.2.2","2. What is the method of effecting their cure ? If one is irascible, he is directed so to govern himself that even if he is assaulted or reviled, he should not feel affronted. And in this course he is to persevere for a long time till the choleric temperament has been eradicated. If one is arrogant, he should accustom himself to endure much contumely, sit below every one, and wear old and ragged garments that bring the wearer into contempt, and so forth, till arrogance is eradicated from his heart and he has regained the middle path, which is the right way. And when he has returned to this path, he should walk in it the rest of his days. On similar lines, he should treat all his dispositions. If, in any of them, he is at one extreme, he should move to the opposite extreme, and keep to it for a long time till he has regained the right path which is the normal mean in every class of dispositions."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.2.3","3. There are some dispositions in regard to which it is forbidden merely to keep to the middle path. They must be shunned to the extreme. Such a disposition is pride. The right way in this regard is not to be merely meek, but to be humble-minded and lowly of spirit to the utmost. And therefore was it said of Moses that he was ""<i>exceedingly</i> meek,"" (Num. 12:3), not merely that he was ""meek"". Hence, our sages exhorted us, ""Be exceedingly, exceedingly lowly of spirit"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:4). They also said that any one who permits his heart to swell with haughtiness has denied the essential principle of our religion, as it is said, ""And thy heart will be proud, and thou wilt forget the Lord, thy God"" (Deut. 8:14). Again have they said, ""Under a ban be he who is proud, even in the smallest degree"". Anger too, is an exceedingly bad passion, and one should avoid it to the last extreme. One should train oneself not to be angry even for something that would justify anger. If one wishes to arouse fear in his children and household, or in the members of a community of which he is the head, and desires to exhibit anger, so that they may amend their ways, he should make a show of anger before them, so as to correct them, but in reality, his mind should be composed like that of a man who simulates anger and does not really feel it. The ancient sages said, ""He who is angry—it is the same as if he worshipped idols."" They also said, ""One who yields to anger, —if he is a sage, his wisdom departs from him; if he is a prophet, his prophetic gift departs from him."" Those of an irate disposition—their life is not worth living. The sages therefore, charged us that anger should be avoided to such a degree that one should train oneself to be unmoved even by things that naturally would provoke anger; and this is the good way. The practice of the righteous is to suffer contumely and not inflict it; to hear themselves reproached, not retort; to be impelled in what they do by love, and to rejoice in suffering. Of them Scripture saith, ""And they that love Him are like the going forth of the sun in his strength."" (Judges 5:31)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.2.4","4. One should always cultivate the habit of silence, and only converse on topics of wisdom or on matters of moment to one's existence. Of Rav, disciple of our sainted teacher (R. Judah, the Prince) it was said that throughout his life he never indulged in idle conversation, of which most people's talk consists. And even of our material needs, we should not speak much. In this connection, our wise men charged, ""He who multiplies words causes sin"" (Ethics of the Fathers, 1:17). They further said, ""I have found naught of better service to the body than silence"" (ibid.). So too, in discussing Torah and Wisdom, a man's words should be few but full of meaning. This, the sages express in their recommendation: ""A man should always teach his disciples tersely"". But where words are many and their meaning is small—that is folly, of which it is said, ""For the dream cometh with much discussion, and a fool's voice with an abundance of words"" (Eccles. 5:2)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.2.5","5. ""A fence to wisdom is silence"" (Ethics of the Fathers, 3:17). Hence, a man should not be hasty in reply, nor talk much. He should teach his pupils gently and calmly, not shouting, and avoiding prolixity. Solomon said, ""The words of the wise, spoken quietly, are heard"" (Eccles. 9:17)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.2.6","6. It is forbidden to accustom oneself to smooth speech and flatteries. One must not say one thing and mean another. Inward and outward self should correspond; only what we have in mind, should we utter with the mouth. We must deceive no one, not even an idolater. A man, for example, must not sell to an idolater flesh from a beast that has died naturally, as if it were meat of an animal ritually slaughtered. Nor should one sell a shoe, the leather of which came from the hide of a beast that met with a natural death, allowing it to be believed that the leather had come from the hide of a ritually slaughtered animal. One must not urge another to join one at a meal, when one is aware that the invitation will not be accepted. Nor should one press upon another any marks of friendship which one knows will be declined. So too, casks of wine, which must be opened for sale, should not be broached in such a way as to deceive a guest and make him believe that they had been opened in his honour, and so forth. Even a single word of flattery or deception is forbidden. A person should always cherish truthful speech, an upright spirit and a pure heart free from all frowardness and perversity."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.2.7","7. One should not indulge in jesting and mockery nor be melancholy and mournful, but one should be cheerful. So our sages said, ""Jesting and levity lead a man on to lewdness"" (Ethics of the Fathers, 3:17). They further charged that a man should not give way to immoderate laughter, nor yet be sad and mournful but should receive everyone with a cheerful countenance. One should also not cherish large desires—hurrying to get rich, — nor be melancholy and idle, but should be contented, engage a little in secular occupation and devote oneself to the study of the Torah, and rejoice in the little one has as his portion. One should not be quarrelsome, jealous, or sensual; nor run after honour. Thus our wise men said, ""Envy, lust and ambition take a man from the world"" (Ethics of Fathers, 4:2). In fine, in every class of dispositions, a man should choose the mean so that all one's dispositions shall occupy the exact middle between the extremes. This is what Solomon expressed in the text, ""Balance the course of thy steps, so that all thy ways may be right"" (Prov. 4:26)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.3.1","1. Possibly a person may say: ""Since envy, cupidity and ambition are evil qualities to cultivate and lead to a man's ruin, I will avoid them to the uttermost, and seek their contraries."" A person following this principle, will not eat meat, nor drink wine, nor marry nor dwell in a decent home, nor wear comely apparel, but will clothe himself in sackcloth and coarse wool like the idolaters' priests. This too, is the wrong way, not to be followed. Whoever persists in such a course is termed a sinner. Of the Nazirite, it is said ""He (the priest) shall make atonement for him, for the sin that he committed against the soul."" (Num. 6:11). On this text, the Sages comment, ""If the Nazirite who only abstained from wine stands in need of an atonement, how much more so one who deprives himself of all legitimate enjoyments."" The Sages accordingly enjoined us that we should only refrain from that which the Torah has expressly withdrawn from our use. And no one should, by vows and oaths, inhibit to himself the use of things permitted. ""Do not the prohibitions of the Torah"", say our sages, ""suffice thee, that thou addest others for thyself ?"" In this condemnation, those are included, who make a practice of fasting; they too are not walking in the right way; our wise men prohibited self-mortification by fasting. And concerning this and similar excesses Solomon exhorts us, ""Be not overrighteous, nor excessively wise. Wherefore shouldst thou be desolate?"" (Eccles. 7:16)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.3.2","2. A man should direct all his thoughts and activities to the knowledge of God, alone. This should be his aim in sitting, rising and conversation. How should this be caried out ? Whether engaged in commerce or in manual labour for profit, one's heart should not be solely set on the accumulation of wealth, but he should do these things in order to obtain therewith his bodily needs—food, drink, shelter, the demands of married life. So too, when he eats, drinks, or cohabits, his purpose should not be to secure physical gratification, in which case he would only eat and drink that which was pleasing to the palate, and cohabit for the sake of sensual pleasure, but he should have it in mind that he eats and drinks solely to maintain his body and its organs in health and vigour. He will then not partake of everything which the palate craves, like a dog or an ass, but will choose foods that are wholesome to the body, whether these be sweet or bitter; and will avoid eating things that are injurious to the body, even though they taste sweet. One, for instance, who is of a hot humour, will not eat flesh-meat or honey, nor drink wine, as Solomon said in a metaphorical sense, ""It is not good to eat much honey"". (Prov. 25:27). Such a person should rather drink an infusion of chicory, even though it is bitter. And so, since life is impossible without eating and drinking, he will be guided in his choice of food and drink by hygienic considerations, to recover and maintain sound health. Thus too, in married life, his purpose in cohabitation will be to preserve health or propagate his species. He will consequently not indulge in intercourse whenever the desire seizes him, but only when he is conscious that emission is hygienically necessary or when his purpose is to continue his race."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.3.3","3. He who regulates his life in accordance with the laws of hygiene, with the sole motive of maintaining a sound and vigorous physique and begetting children to do his work and labour for his benefit, is not following the right course. A man should aim to maintain physical health and vigour, in order that his soul may be upright, in a condition to know God. For it is impossible for one to understand sciences and meditate upon them, when he is hungry or sick, or when any of his limbs is aching. And in cohabitation, one should set one's heart on having a son who may become a sage and a great man in Israel. Whoever throughout his life follows this course will be continually serving God, even while engaged in business and even during cohabitation, because his purpose in all that he does will be to satisfy his needs. so as to have a sound body with which to serve God. Even when he sleeps and seeks repose, to calm his mind and rest his body, so as not to fall sick and be incapacitated from serving God, his sleep is service of the Almighty. In this sense, our wise men charged us, ""Let all thy deeds be for the sake of God."" (Ethics of the Fathers 2: 17). And Solomon, in his wisdom, said, ""In all thy ways know Him, and He will make thy paths straight."" (Prov. 3:6)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.1","1. Since, by keeping the body in health and vigour, one walks in the ways of God—it being impossible during sickness to have any understanding or knowledge of the Creator—it is a man's duty to avoid whatever is injurious to the body, and cultivate habits conducive to health and vigour. These are as follows: One should not take food except when one is hungry; nor drink unless one is thirsty. One should not neglect the calls of nature for a single moment, but respond to them immediately."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.2","2. Food should not be taken to repletion; during a meal, about one-third less should be eaten than the quantity that would give a feeling of satiety, and only a little water should be drunk—and that mixed with wine. After the process of digestion has commenced, water may be taken as needed. But even after food has been digested, it should not be drunk copiously. Before eating, careful attention should be paid to the functions of excretion. No meal should be taken without previously walking till the body begins to get warm, or engaging in manual labour, or tiring oneself with other activities. In short, strenuous exercise should be taken every day in the morning, till the body is in a glow. Then, there should be an interval of rest till one has recovered composure. The meal may then be taken. If the exercise is followed by a bath of warm water, so much the better. In this case too, there should be an interval for repose before the meal."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.3","3. During a meal, one should sit or recline on the left side; but not walk, ride, take violent exercise, sway the body, or engage in sport, till the food is digested. Any one who engages in sport or violent exercise immediately after a meal, subjects himself to grave disorders."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.4","4. The day and night consist of twenty-four hours. It is sufficient to sleep for a third of that period, namely eight hours. And these hours should be in the latter part of the night; that is to say, the period from retirement to dawn should be eight hours so that one will rise from his bed before dawn."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.5","5. One should not sleep, face downwards, nor on one's back, but lying on the side; at the beginning, on the left side, and at the close of one's rest, on the right side. One should not go to sleep immediately after a meal, but only when three or four hours have elapsed. One should not sleep during the day."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.6","6. Laxative foods, such as grapes, figs, mulberries, pears, watermelons, the various kinds of cucumbers or gherkins, should be taken before the meal. These, however, should not be mixed with the main dish that constitutes the meal. An interval should elapse till these have passed out of the stomach before the meal is taken. Immediately after, foods that tone up the digestive organs, should be eaten, such as pomegranates, quinces, apples and small pears;<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* See <i>Tifereth Israel</i> (Commentary) on <i>Mishnah Kilaim</i> 1:3, note 41.</i> but even these fruits must not be indulged in too freely."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.7","7. When it is desired to eat at the same meal poultry and the meat of cattle, the poultry should be eaten first. When eggs and poultry form part of the same meal, the eggs should be consumed first. When the meat of large and of small cattle are eaten at the same meal, the latter should come first. The lighter should always precede the heavier diet."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.8","8. In the summer time, cold food should be consumed; one should be sparing with condiments; vinegar should be used. During winter, warm foods should be eaten; condiments should be liberally used with a little mustard and assafoetida. A similar plan should be followed in cold and warm countries. The diet, in every district, should be chosen to suit the climate."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.9","9. Some foods are very injurious and ought never be eaten. For example, large salted stale fish; salted stale cheese; truffles and mushrooms; stale salted meat; <i>must</i> (fresh wine taken from the wine press); cooked food kept so long that it has lost its savour; any food that is malodorous or very bitter—all these are like deadly poison to the body. There are other kinds of food that are injurious but not to the same extent as those just mentioned. A little of them at a time may therefore be taken, but only at intervals of several days. One should not accustom oneself to make a meal of them or to eat them regularly with the meal. Examples of this class are large fish; cheese; milk, twenty-four hours after milking; the meat of big steers and big goats; beans, lentils, peas; barley bread; unleavened bread; cabbage; leeks, onions, garlic; mustard and raddish. All these are bad foods. They should be eaten very sparingly and only during winter. In the summer, they should not be eaten at all. Neither in summer nor in winter should beans or lentils be eaten as a separate dish. Gourds may be eaten in summer."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.10","10. There are other kinds of food that are also bad, but not to the extent of those just mentioned. These are waterfowl, small young pigeons, dates, bread fried in oil or the dough of which was kneaded with oil, fine meal so completely sifted that not a trace of bran remained, meat juice, and brine of salted fish. These should not be freely used. A man who is wise and exercises self-control, who does not yield to his appetite and never partakes of the above named foods, unless he needs them as a medicine, is indeed a hero !"

These should not be eaten freely, even when dried, and, needless to add, when they are fresh. Before they are quite ripe, thy are like daggers to the body. So too locust (St. John's bread) is always bad. All sour fruits are bad and should be eaten sparingly, and only during summer or in hot climates. But figs, grapes and almonds are always good to eat—whether fresh or dried and may be eaten as much as one needs; but they should not be eaten constantly, even though they are the best of the tree-fruits."

It is a leading principle in medicine that if there is constipation or if the bowels move with difficulty, grave disorders result. How is a slight costive condition to be remedied ? If the patient is a youth, he should eat, every morning, salty foods well cooked and seasoned with olive oil, fish brine and salt, without bread. Or he should drink the liquid of boiled spinach or, St. John's bread, mixed with olive oil, fish brine and salt. An old man should drink, in the morning, honey diluted with warm water, and wait about four hours before taking his breakfast. This regimen should be observed for one day, or, if necessary, for three or four successive days till the bowels move freely."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.14","14. Another great principle of hygiene, physicians say, is as follows: As long as a person takes active exercise, works hard, does not over-eat and keeps his bowels open, he will be free from disease and will increase in vigour, even though the food he eats is coarse."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.15","15. But if one leads a sedentary life and does not take exercise, neglects the calls of nature, or is constipated—even if he eats wholesome food and takes care of himself in accordance with medical rules—he will, throughout his life, be subject to aches and pains and his strength will fail him. Over-eating is like a deadly poison to any constitution and is the principal cause of all diseases. Most maladies that afflict mankind result from bad food or are due to the patient filling his stomach with an excess of food that may even have been wholesome. Thus, Solomon, in his wisdom, said, ""He who keeps his mouth and tongue, keeps his soul from troubles."" (Prov. 21:23)—which text can be applied to the individual who guards his mouth from bad food and over-eating, and keeps his tongue from all speech except that which is necessary to obtain his needs."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.16","16. The correct procedure in bathing is to take a bath once a week. One should not step into the bath directly after a meal nor when hungry, but only after digestion has begun. The entire body should be bathed in water that is warm but not scalding. The head alone may be washed with water hot enough to scald the body. The body should then be washed in tepid water, then in lukewarm water, and so on, gradually reducing the temperature, till the water finally used is quite cold. Water, either lukewarm or cold, should not be poured upon the head. In the rainy season cold baths should not be taken. Nor should one rinse the body before it has perspired and become supple. Nor should one stay too long in the bath, but as soon as one perspires and the body has become supple, one should complete the ablutions and leave. Before and after bathing, attention should be paid to the excretory functions, as also before and after eating a meal, before and after sexual intercourse, before and after physical exercise, before going to bed and on rising. There are thus altogether ten occasions on which this rule should be followed."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.17","17. When one has come out of the bath, he should put on his clothes and cover his head in the outer chamber, so as to avoid catching cold. Even in summer, this precaution should be taken. After leaving the bath, a person should wait a while till he has recovered his composure, and his body is rested and cool. Then a meal may be taken. A little sleep, after leaving the bath and before the meal, is excellent. Cold water should not be drunk after bathing and certainly not while taking the bath. If, after the bath, one feels thirsty and cannot resist the desire to drink, the water should be mixed with wine or honey and then it may be drunk. During the winter, anointing the body with oil, after the final ablution, is beneficial."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.18","18. One should not accustom oneself to being frequently bled. Recourse to this procedure should only be had in case of special need. One should not be bled in summer or in winter, and only to a slight extent in the month of Nissan and Tishri. After the age of fifty, this treatment should be entirely discontinued. A person should not be bled and take a bath on the same day or set out on a journey on the same day; nor should one be bled on the day when he has returned from a journey. On the day when one is bled, less food and drink should be taken than usual. On that day, he should rest, avoid exertion and violent physical exercise, and not take part in sport."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.19","19. <i>Semen</i> constitutes the strength of the body, its life and the light of the eyes. Its emission to excess causes physical decay, debility and diminished vitality. Thus, Solomon, in his wisdom, said: ""Give not thy strength unto women"". (Prov. 31:3). Whosoever indulges in sexual dissipation becomes prematurely aged; his strength fails; his eyes become dim; a foul odour proceeds from his mouth and armpits; the hair of his head, eye-brows and eye-lashes drop our; the hair of his beard, armpits and legs grow abnormally; his teeth fall out; and besides these, he becomes subject to numerous other diseases. Medical authorities have stated that for each one who dies of other maladies, a thousand are the victims of sexual excess. A man should, therefore, be careful in this regard if he wishes to lead a happy life. He should only cohabit when he finds himself in good health and vigour, experiences involuntary erections which persist after he has diverted his mind to other things, is conscious of a heaviness from the loins downwards as if the spermatic cords were being drawn and his flesh is hot. Such a condition calls for cohabitation which then is conducive to health. One should not cohabit, when sated with food, nor when one is hungry but only after a meal has been digested. Before and after coition, attention should be paid to the excretory functions. Coition should not take place in a standing or sitting posture, nor in a bath house, nor on the day when one takes a bath or is bled, nor on the day when one sets out on a journey or has returned from a journey, nor on the day previous to any of such days or subsequent to them."

Whoever lives in accordance with the directions I have set forth, has my assurance that he will never be sick till he grows old and dies; he will not be in need of a physician, and will enjoy normal health as long as he lives—unless his constitution be congenitally defective, or he has acquired bad habits from his early childhood, or if the world should be visited by pestilence or drought."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.21","21. All the useful rules here recommended are suitable to those who enjoy good health. But a person who is generally ailing or suffers from a local disorder, or has for several years been addicted to an evil habit, needs special treatment, according to the nature of his sickness—as is expounded in medical literature. ""Change of mode of living is the beginning of sickness""."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.22","22. In a place where there is no physician, both those that are well and those that are ailing should not diverge from the methods prescribed in this chapter. The observance of every one of them will yield beneficial results."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.4.23","23. No disciple of the wise may live in a city that is unprovided with the following ten officials and institutions, namely: a physician, a surgeon, a bath-house, a lavatory, a source of water supply such as a stream or a spring, a synagogue, a school teacher, a scribe, a treasurer of charity funds for the poor, a court that has authority to punish with stripes and imprisonment."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.1","1. Even as a sage is recognized by his wisdom and moral principles which distinguish him from the rest of the people, so ought he to be recognized in all his activities, in his food and drink, in the fulfillment of his marital obligations, in attention to his excretory functions, in his talk, walk, dress, management of his affairs and business transactions. All these activities should bear the mark of exceeding refinement and orderliness. For example, a scholar will not be a glutton but will eat food conducive to health; and of such food he will not eat to excess. He will not be eager to fill his stomach, like those who gorge themselves with food and drink till the body swells. Concerning such people, the Scripture saith, ""I will spread dung on your faces"" (Malachi 2:3). This text, our wise men say, refers to those who eat and drink and spend all their days as if they were holidays. They are the people who exclaim, ""Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die"". (Is. 22:13). This is how the wicked eat. They are reprobated in the verse, ""For all tables are full of filthy vomit, and no place is clean"" (Is. 28:8). The wise man, on the contrary, will only partake of one or two courses, of which he will consume as much as he needs to sustain him. Thus, Solomon said, ""The righteous eateth to satisfy himself"" (Prov. 13:25)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.2","2. When the wise man eats the modest meal that is proper for him, he will consume it nowhere else than at home, at his own table. Except in extreme emergencies, he will not eat in a restaurant or in the street, so as not to incur popular contempt. He will not accept invitations to take meals with unrefined people, nor will he sit down at tables that are not clean. He will not make it a practice to take his meal in all sorts of places, even in the company of scholars. He will not eat at banquets where there is a large crowd. It is indeed improper for a scholar to accept an invitation to any banquet unless it partakes of a religious character, as for example, on the occasion of a betrothal or a marriage, and then only when the bridegroom is a scholar, and the bride, a scholar's daughter. The righteous and saints in ancient times never ate anywhere but at home."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.3","3. When a sage drinks wine, he will only take enough to moisten the food which he has eaten. Any one who allows himself to become inebriated is a sinner and despicable, and loses his wisdom. If he becomes intoxicated in the presence of the ignorant, he has profaned the Name (of God). It is forbidden to drink wine at noon, in however small a quantity, unless it forms part of a meal; for, if it is then taken, it does not intoxicate. We have to be on our guard only in respect to wine drunk after the meal is over."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.4","4. Although connubial intercourse with one's wife is always permitted, still this relation too should be invested by the scholar with sanctity. He should not be always with his spouse, after the manner of a rooster, but should fulfill his marital obligation on Friday nights, if he is in a physically vigorous condition. Cohabitation should take place not at the beginning of the night when one is satiated and the stomach is full, nor towards the close of the night when one feels hungry, but at midnight, when the food is digested. He should not indulge in excessive frivolity, nor defile his mouth with lewd talk, even when he is alone with his wife. For the text, ""He declareth to a man what is his discourse"" (Amos 4:13), was interpreted by our sages traditionally to mean that ""a man will be called to account even for light conversation between him and his wife"". When cohabiting, neither husband nor wife should be in a state of intoxication, lethargy or melancholy. The wife should not be asleep at the time. The husband is not to force her, if she is unwilling. Coition should take place with the consent of both, and while they are full of desire and joyousness. The husband should converse and jest with his wife for a little while, so as to put her in a pleasant frame of mind and then cohabit modestly and not shamelessly. After the completion of the act, he should at once separate from her."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.5","5. Whoever observes this procedure not only hallows his soul, purifies his heart and refines his mind, but if he has children, they will be comely, modest, and disposed to wisdom and saintliness. One who follows the customs of the common people who walk in darkness, will have children like theirs."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.6","6. Extreme modesty is cultivated by scholars. They will not do aught that might expose them to contempt. They will not bare their heads or body. Even when responding to a call of nature, the scholar will behave decently; not bare himself till he sits down, nor dry himself with his right hand; he will withdraw from all people to the most private part of his dwelling or of a cave; or if he relieves himself behind a fence, he will withdraw to a distance so that others may not hear him. If he relieves himself in an open plain, he will go so far away that nobody can see his bare body. While relieving himself, he will not talk, even if there be great need. And as he conducts himself decently by day, so will he behave at night. One should get into the habit of relieving oneself in the morning and the evening, so as not to have to traverse long distances."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.7","7. A scholar, when speaking, will not shout or scream, like domestic cattle or wild beasts. He will not raise his voice unduly. His speech with all men will be gentle. But while speaking gently, he will be careful to avoid exaggeration which would make his speech sound affected, like the speech of the haughty. He will be the first to greet every one he meets, so that they will be well disposed towards him. He will judge every one favourably. He will dwell on the merits of others and never speak disparagingly of anybody. He loves peace and ensues it. If he feels that his words will be effective and heeded, he will speak; otherwise, he will remain silent. For instance, he will not attempt to appease his neighbour when the latter is exasperated, nor question him concerning his vows immediately after he has made them, but will wait till the man's mind has become cool and composed. He will not attempt to console the mourner while the dead still lies unburied; for till the body is interred, the mourner's mind is preoccupied. And thus he will behave in circumstances of a similar kind. He will not show himself in his neighbour's presence when that person is in disgrace, but will avoid meeting him. He will not deviate from the truth; neither add to it nor detract from it, except in the interest of peace or similar worthy aims. In short, he will limit his speech to topics of wisdom, benevolence, and the like. He will not enter into conversation with a woman on the street, not even with his wife, sister, or daughter."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.8","8. The scholar will not walk with proud mien and outstretched neck—attitudes condemned in the text ""They walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes"" (Is. 3:16). He will not walk mincingly and with short steps after the fashion of women and the haughty, as it is said ""Walking mincingly as they go and making a tinkling noise with their feet"" (Is. 3:16). He will not run in the street, after the manner of madmen, nor will he stoop, bent double like a hunchback, but will look towards the ground as one does when praying and will walk at the pace of a man busy with his affairs. A person's gait indicates whether he is wise and sensible or a foolish idiot. Thus Solomon, in his wisdom, said ""Yea also, when a fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he proclaimeth to every one that he is a fool"" (Eccles. 10:3); that is, by his behaviour he advertises himself as a fool."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.9","9. A scholar's dress will be becoming and clean. It is an offence for such a man if a stain or grease or the like is found on his garment. He should not put on robes befitting royalty, such as those embroidered with gold or purple, which attract universal attention; nor, on the other hand, shabby garments such as are worn by the poor, which bring contempt upon the wearer, but he will wear apparel suitable to the middle classes and that is neat. His flesh should not show under the clothing, as is the case with the extremely light linen fabrics manufactured in Egypt. His garments should not drag on the ground like those worn by the arrogant, but should only reach to the heels, while the sleeves may extend to the finger-tips. He should not let down his fringed garment—this being a mark of arrogance—except on Sabbaths, if he has no other change of garments. He should not, in summer, wear clouted shoes, with patch upon patch; but in winter, this is permitted if one is poor. He should not go forth into the street with his person or garments perfumed; nor should he apply perfume to his hair; but if he anoints his body with perfume, in order to remove unpleasant effluvium—this is permitted. So too, he should not go out at night alone, unless at the fixed hour when he has to attend a course of study. The object of all these rules is to save one from being suspected (of following evil courses)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.10","10. The scholar manages his affairs with judgment and prudence; spends on food, drink, and maintenance of his household, in accordance with his income and the state of his finances. He will not put himself to excessive trouble (to be considered wealthy). The wise men recommended in their rules for right living, that a man should not eat flesh meat, unless he longs for it, as it is said ""Because thy soul desireth to eat flesh"" (Deut. 12:20). For a healthy individual it is enough to eat meat once a week, on Friday evenings. But, if one is rich enough to eat meat every day, he may do so. The sages charged that a person should eat less than he can afford; dress in accordance with his means and as befits his station in life; and spend on his wife and children more than he can afford in order to secure respect for them."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.11","11. The sensible course is for a man first to choose an occupation that will give him a livelihood, then buy himself a home; and after that, take a wife; as it is said ""And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard and not redeemed it ?…. What man is there that has built a new house and hath not dedicated it ?…. and what man is there that hath betrothed a woman and not taken her?…. (Deut. 20:6-5-7). But the foolish first marry; then if one of this sort can afford it, he purchases a house; and, last of all, towards the end of his life, he sets about seeking a trade or lives on charity. Thus it is said in <i>the Imprecations,</i> ""A wife shalt thou betroth… a house shalt thou build… a vineyard shalt thou plant"" (Deut. 28:30); that is, all your activities shall be in the reverse order of what they should be, so that you will not prosper in your ways. And a blessing is conveyed in the Scriptural text ""And David had success in all his ways; and the Lord was with him"" (1. Sam. 18:14)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.12","12. A person is forbidden to declare all his property derelict or devote it to the sanctuary and thus become a public charge. He should not sell a field and buy a house with the proceeds; or sell a house and buy movables, or use the money in trade; but he may sell movables and buy a field. To sum up, he should make it his aim to employ his capital successfully (and convert the perishable into the durable<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Not in the M.

"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.5.13","13. The scholar conducts his business affairs honestly and in good faith. His nay is nay; his yea, yea. In his accounts, he is strict (in meeting his obligations). At the same time, when buying, he is liberal and does not drive a hard bargain. He pays promptly for his purchases. He declines to act as a surety or trustee; nor will he accept a power of attorney. In commercial matters, he acknowledges liability even where the law would not hold him liable; his principle being to keep his word and not change it. If others have been adjudged liable to him, he is considerate, and even forgives them the amount due. He grants benevolent<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* without interest.</i> loans and does favours. He will not encroach on another man's business, and throughout his life will not vex a human being. In short, he belongs to the class of those who are persecuted but do not persecute, who are reviled but do not revile. A man who acts thus is commended in the Scriptural text ""And He said unto me, thou art my servant, Israel, in whom I glory"" (Is. 49:3)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.1","1. It is natural to be influenced, in sentiments and conduct, by one's neighbours and associates, and observe the customs of one's fellow citizens. Hence, a person ought constantly to associate with the righteous and frequent the company of the wise, so as to learn from their practices, and shun the wicked who are benighted, so as not to be corrupted by their example. So Solomon saith ""He that walketh with the wise, shall be wise; but the companion of fools shall smart for it"" (Prov. 13:20). And it is also said ""Happy is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked"" (Psalms 1:1). So too, if one lives in a country where the customs are pernicious, and the inhabitants do not go in the right way, he should leave for a place where the people are righteous and follow the ways of the good. If all the countries of which he has personal knowledge, or concerning which he hears reports, fellow a course that is not right—as is the case in our times—or if military campaigns or sickness debar him from leaving for a country with good customs, he should live by himself in seclusion, as it is said, ""Let him sit alone and keep silence"" (Lam. 3:28). And if the inhabitants are wicked reprobates who will not let him stay in the country unless he mixes with them and adopts their evil practices, let him withdraw to caves, thickets or deserts, and not habituate himself to the ways of sinners, as it is said ""O that I were in the wilderness, in a lodging place of wayfaring men"" (Jerem. 9:1)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.2","2. It is an affirmative precept to attach oneself to sages and their disciples, so as to learn from their example; as it is said, ""And unto Him shalt thou cleave"" (Deut. 10:20). But can a human being cleave to the <i>Shechinah</i> ? Our wise men explained this text thus: ""Attach thyself to sages and their disciples"". A man should, accordingly, strive to win a scholar's daughter for a wife, and should give his daughter in marriage to a scholar. He should eat and drink in the company of scholars; give them opportunities to do business, and cultivate their society in every relation, as it is said ""And to cleave unto Him"" (Deut. 11:22). So too, our sages exorted us ""Sit in the dust of their feet, and drink their words thirstily"" (Ethics of the Fathers 1:4)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.3","3. It is incumbent on every one to love each individual Israelite as himself, as it is said ""Thou shalt love they neighbour, as thyself"" (Lev. 19:18). Hence, a person ought to speak in praise of his neighbour and be careful of his neighbour's property as he is careful of his own property and solicitous about his own honour. Whoever glorifies himself by humilitating another person, will have no portion in the world to come."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.4","4. To love the proselyte who comes to take refuge beneath the wings of the <i>Shechinah</i> is the fulfilment of two affirmative precepts. First, because he is included among neighbours (whom we are commanded to love) (Lev. 19:18). And secondly, because he is a stranger, and the Torah said ""Love ye therefore the stranger"" (Deut. 10:19). God charged (us) concerning the love of the stranger, even as He charged us concerning love of Himself, as it is said ""Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God"" (Deut. 6:5). The Holy One, blessed be He, loves strangers, as it is said ""And He loveth the stranger"" (Deut. 10:18)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.5","5. Whoever entertains in his heart hatred of any Israelite, transgresses a prohibition, as it is said ""Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart"" (Lev. 19:17). The violation of this precept is however not punished with stripes, as no overt act is involved. The Torah, in this text, only warned against hatred in the heart. But any one who smites or reviles his neighbour, although he is not permitted to do so, is not infringing the precept ""Thou shalt not hate thy brother""."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.6","6. When a man sins against another, the injured party should not hate the offender and keep silent, as it is said concerning the wicked ""And Absalom spake to Amnon neither good nor evil, for Absalom hated Amnon"" (2. Sam. 13:22). But it is his duty to inform the offender and say to him ""Why did you do this to me ? Why did you sin against me in this matter ?"" And thus it is said ""Thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour"" (Lev. 19:17). If the offender repents and pleads for forgiveness, he should be forgiven. The forgiver should not be obdurate, as it is said ""And Abraham prayed unto God"" (for Abimelech) (Gen. 20:17)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.7","7. If one observes that a person committed a sin or walks in a way that is not good, it is a duty to bring the erring man back to the right path and point out to him that he is wronging himself by his evil courses, as it is said ""Thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour"" (Lev. 19:17). He who rebukes another, whether for offences against the rebuker himself or for sins against God, should administer the rebuke in private, speak to the offender gently and tenderly, and point out that he is only speaking for the wrongdoer's own good, to secure for him life in the world to come. If the latter accepts the rebuke, well and good. If not, he should be rebuked a second, and a third time. And so one is bound to continue the admonitions, till the sinner assaults the admonisher and says to him ""I refuse to listen"". Whoever is in a position to prevent wrongdoing and does not do so, is responsible for the iniquity of all the wrongdoers whom he might have checked."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.8","8. He who rebukes another must not at first speak to the offender harshly so as to put him to shame, as it is said ""And thou shalt not suffer sin because of him"" (Lev. 19:17). Our Rabbis explained this text as follows: ""Since it might have been supposed that you are to rebuke the sinner till he changes colour, therefore it is said ""And thou shalt not bear sin because of him"". Hence, the inference that it is forbidden to put an Israelite to shame, especially in public. Although one who puts another to shame is not punished with stripes, still it is a grave offence. And thus the sages said, ""He who shames another in public has no portion in the world to come"". One ought therefore to beware of publicly shaming anyone, whether he be young or old. One should not call a person by a name of which he feels ashamed, nor relate anything in his presence which humiliates him. This applies to matters between man and man. But in regard to duties to God, if an individual, after having been privately rebuked, does not repent, he should be shamed in public; his sin should be openly declared; he is to be reviled, affronted and cursed till he returns to the right course. This was the method followed by all the prophets of Israel."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.9","9. If one who has been wronged by another, does not wish to rebuke or speak to the offender because the latter is a very common person or mentally defective, and if he has sincerely forgiven him, and neither bears him ill-will nor rebukes him—he acts according to the standard of saints. All that the Torah objects to is harbouring ill-will."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.6.10","10. A man ought to be especially heedful of his behaviour towards widows and orphans, for their souls are exceedingly depressed and their spirits low. Even if they are wealthy, even if they are the widow and orphans of a king, we are specifically enjoined concerning them, as it is said ""Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child"" (Ex. 22:21). How are we to conduct ourselves towards them? One must not speak to them otherwise than tenderly. One must show them unvarying courtesy; not hurt them physically with hard toil, nor wound their feelings with harsh speech. One must take greater care of their property than of one's own. Whoever irritates them, provokes them to anger, pains them, tyrranizes over them, or causes them loss of money, is guilty of a transgression, and still more so, if one beats them or curses them. Though no stripes are inflicted for this transgression, its punishment is explicitly set forth in the Torah (in the following terms) ""My wrath shall wax hot, and I will slay you with the sword"" (Ex. 22:23). He who created the world by His word made a covenant with widows and orphans that when they will cry out because of violence, they will be answered; as it is said, ""If thou afflict them in any wise—for if they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry"" (Ex. 22:22). This only applies to cases where a person afflicts them for his own ends. But if a teacher punishes orphan children in order to teach them Torah or a trade, or lead them in the right way—this is permissible. And yet he should not treat them like others but make a distinction in their favour. He should guide them gently, with the utmost tenderness and courtesy, whether they are bereft of a father or mother, as it is said ""For the Lord will plead their cause"" (Prov. 22:23). To what age are they to be regarded in these respects as orphans ? Till they reach the age when they no longer need an adult on whom they depend to train them and care for them, and when each of them can provide for all his wants, like other grown-up persons."

Whoever tells tales about another person violates a prohibition, as it is said ""Thou shalt not go up and down as a tale-bearer among thy people"" (Lev. 19:16). And although no stripes are inflicted, it is a grave offence, and leads to the death of many souls in Israel. Hence, this precept is followed immediately by the sentence ""Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbour"" (Lev. 19:16). For an example of the tragic consequence of this transgression, read what happened after Doeg's report concerning the priests of Nob. (I. Sam. 22:6-19)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.7.2","2. Who is a tale-bearer ? One who carries reports, and goes about from one person to another and says ""So-and-so said this""; ""Such and such a statement have I heard about so-and so"". Even if what he says or repeats may be true, the tale-bearer ruins the world. There is a still graver offence that comes within this prohibition, namely, the evil tongue.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* A person with an evil tongue is the habitual scandal-monger.</i> This means talking disparagingly of anyone, even though what one says is true; but he who utters falsehood is called a slanderer. A person with an evil tongue is one who, sitting in company, says ""That person did such a thing""; ""So and so's ancestors were so and so""; ""I have heard this about him""; and then proceeds to talk scandal. Of such a person, Scripture says ""May the Lord cut off all smooth lips, the tongue that speaketh proud things"". (Ps. 12:4)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.7.3","3. The sages say ""There are three offences for which one is punished in this world and forfeits his portion in the world to come. These are idolatry, incest and murder; but the evil tongue is equal to all the three put together"". The sages further said ""To indulge in evil speech is like a denial of the fundamental principle of religion, as it is said ""Who said 'our tongue will we make mighty; our lips are with us; who is lord over us ?' "" (Ps. 12:5). The sages also said ""The evil tongue slays three persons: the utterer of evil, the listener, the one spoken about; and the listener will be punished worse than the speaker""."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.7.4","4. There are modes of speech that may be styled ""dust of the evil tongue"". Such are remarks like the following: ""Who would have thought of so-and-so that he would be as he is now.<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** <i>Or,</i> ""who can say of so-and-so that he will always be as he is now.""</i> Or ""be silent about so-and-so. I do not wish to tell what happened, etc."" To speak in a person's favour in the presence of his enemies, savours of the evil tongue. For it will provoke them to speak of him disparagingly. Referring to this, Solomon said ""He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse unto him"" (Prov. 27:14). For out of what had been said to his good, proceedeth evil. Such too is the case of one who indulges in evil speech jokingly and frivolously, and not out of hatred. And so, Solomon, in his wisdom, says ""As one who mockingly casteth firebrands, arrows and death, and saith, am I not jesting?"" (Prov. 26:18). Equally reprehensible is one who indulges in evil speech deceitfully, that is, speaks as it were in all innocence, as if unaware that what he says is an evil utterance, and when a protest is made, replies, ""I do not know that this is evil speech, or that such is the conduct of so-and-so""."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.7.5","5. Whether one indulges in evil speech about a person in his presence, or in his absence, or makes statements which, if repeated, would tend to hurt him physically or injure him financially, distress or alarm him—all this is evil speech. If a statement of this character had been made in the presence of three persons, the subject matter is regarded as public and generally known, and if one of the three repeats it, he is not guilty of evil speech, provided he had no intention to give the story wider currency."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.7.6","6. All such persons are scandal-mongers in whose neighbourhood it is forbidden to reside; and still more is it forbidden to cultivate their society and listen to them. The sentence passed upon our forefathers in the wilderness was confirmed, only because they were guilty of the sin of the evil tongue."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.7.7","7. He who takes revenge, violates a prohibition, and it is said ""Thou shalt not take vengeance"" (Lev. 19:18). And although he is not punished with stripes, still such conduct indicates an exceedingly bad disposition. One should rather practise forbearance in all secular matters. For the intelligent realise that these are vain things and not worth taking vengeance for. What is ""taking vengeance""? The following is a case. A neighbour says to one, ""Lend me your axe"". He replies ""I will not lend it to you"". The next day, the latter needs a similar favour from the neighbour and says to him ""Lend me <i>your</i> axe"", and receives the reply ""I will not lend it to you, for you did not lend me your axe when I asked it of you"". Any one who acts in this way is ""taking vengeance."" But when he comes to borrow aught, one should give what is asked cheerfully, and not repay discourtesy with discourtesy. And so in similar cases. Thus David, expressing his excellent sentiments, said ""If I have requited him that did evil unto me, or despoiled mine adversary"" …(Ps. 7:5)."
"LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT,.7.8","8. So too, one who bears a grudge against a fellow-Israelite violates a prohibition, as it is said, ""Nor bear a grudge against the children of thy people"" (Lev. 19:18). What is ""bearing a grudge ?"" A said to B, ""Let this house to me, or let me borrow this ox"". B refuses. After a time, B comes to A to borrow or hire something. A replies ""Here it is. I lend it to you. I am not like you. I will not treat you as you treated me"". One who acts thus, transgresses the commandment ""Thou shalt not bear a grudge"". One should blot the thing out of his mind and not bear a grudge. For as long as one nurses a grievance and keeps it in mind, one may come to take vengeance. The Torah, accordingly, emphatically warns us not to bear a grudge, so that the impression of the wrong shall be quite obliterated and be no longer remembered. This is the right principle. It alone makes civilized life and social intercourse possible."

Laws of Foundations of the Torah.1.1,"1. The basic principle of all basic principles and the pillar of all sciences is to realise that there is a First Being who brought every existing thing into being. All existing things, whether celestial, terrestrial, or belonging to an intermediate class, exist only through His true Existence."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.1.2,"2. If it could be supposed that He did not exist, it would follow that nothing else could possibly exist."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.1.3,"3. If, however, it were supposed that all other beings were non-existent, He alone would still exist. Their non-existence would not involve His non-existence. For all beings are in need of Him; but He, blessed be He, is not in need of them nor of any of them."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.1.4,"I.<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** The Arabic numerals are as in the printed editions; the Roman numerals, as in the Bodleian Manuscript.</i> Hence, His real essence is unlike that of any of them."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.1.5,"4. This is what the prophet means when he says ""But the Eternal is the true God"" (Jer. 10:10); that is, He alone real, and nothing else has reality like His reality. The same thought the Torah expresses in the text: ""There is none else besides Him"" (Deut. 4:35) ; that is : There is no being besides Him, that is really like Him."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.1.6,"II.<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** The Arabic numerals are as in the printed editions; the Roman numerals, as in the Bodleian Manuscript.</i> 5. This being is the God of the Universe, the Lord of all the Earth. And He it is, who controls the Sphere (of the Universe) with a power that is without end or limit; with a power that is never intermitted. For the Sphere is always revolving; and it is impossible for it to revolve without someone making it revolve. God, blessed be He, it is, who, without hand or body, causes it to revolve."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.1.7,"6. To acknowledge this truth is an affirmative precept, as it is said ""I am the Lord, thy God"" (Ex. 20:2; Deut. 5:6). And whoever permits the thought to enter his mind that there is another deity besides this God, violates a prohibition ; as it is said ""Thou shalt have no other gods before me"" (Ex. 20:3; Deut. 5:7), and denies the essence of Religion—this doctrine being the great principle on which everything depends."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.1.8,"III. 7. This God is One. He is not two nor more than two, but One; so that none of the things existing in the universe to which the term one is applied is like unto His Unity; neither such a unit as a species which comprises many units (e.g. sub-species), nor such a unit as a physical body which consists of parts and dimensions. His Unity is such that there is no other Unity like it in the world."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.1.9,"IV. If there were plural deities, these would be physical bodies; because entities, that can be enumerated and are equal in their essence, are only distinguishable from each other by the accidents<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* <i>Accidents</i> here is the logical term expressing the feature peculiar to an individual distinguishing him from other individuals in his class or properties distinguishing one class from another.</i> that happen to physical bodies. If the Creator were a physical body, He would have bounds and limits, for it is impossible for a physical body to be without limits; and where a body is limited and finite, its energy is also limited and finite. And our God, blessed be his Name, since His power is infinite and unceasing—for the Sphere (of the Universe) is continually revolving—His power is not the energy of a physical body. And since He is not a physical body, the accidents that happen to physical bodies do not apply to Him, so as to distinguish Him from another being. Hence, it is impossible that He can be anything but One. To realize this truth is an affirmative precept, as it is said ""The Eternal, our God, is One God"" (Deut. 6:4)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.1.10,"V. 8. That the Holy One, blessed be He, is not a physical body, is explicitly set forth in the Pentateuch and in the Prophets, as it is said ""(Know therefore) that the Lord, He is God in Heaven above, and upon the Earth beneath"" (Deut. 4:39); and a physical body is not in two places at one time. Furthermore, it is said, ""For Ye saw no manner of similitude"" (Deut. 4:15); and again it is said, ""To whom then will Ye liken me, or shall I be equal ?"" (Is. 40:25). If He were a body, He would be like other bodies."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.1.11,"VI. 9. Since this is so, what is the meaning of the following expressions found in the Torah: ""Beneath his feet"" (Ex. 24:10); ""Written with the finger of God"" (Ex. 31:18); ""The hand of God"" (Ex. 9:3); ""The eyes of God"" (Gen. 38:7); ""The ears of God"" (Num. 11:1); and similar phrases ? All these expressions are adapted to the mental capacity of the majority of mankind who have a clear perception of physical bodies only. The Torah speaks in the language of men. All these phrases are metaphorical like the sentence ""If I whet my glittering sword"" (Deut. 32:41). Has God then a sword and does he slay with a sword? The term is used allegorically and all these phrases are to be understood in a similar sense. That this view is correct is proved by the fact that one prophet says that he had a vision of the Holy One, blessed be He, ""Whose garment was white as snow"" (Dan. 7:9),while another says that he saw Him ""with dyed garments from Bozrah"" (Is. 63:1) Moses, our teacher, himself saw Him at the Red Sea as a mighty man waging war (Ex. 15:3) and on Sinai, as a Congregational Reader wrapped (in his Talith)—all indicating that in reality He has no form or figure. These only appeared in a prophetic vision. But God's essence as it really is, the human mind does not understand and is incapable of grasping or investigating. And this is expressed in the scriptural text ""Canst thou, by searching, find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? (Job 11:7)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.1.12,"10. What was it that Moses sought to comprehend, when he said ""Show me, I beseech thee, Thy glory?"" (Ex. 33:18). He sought to have so clear an apprehension of the truth of God's existence that the knowledge might be like that which one possesses of a human being, whose face one has seen and whose image is imprinted on the mind and whom, therefore, the mind distinguishes from other men. In the same way, Moses, our teacher, asked that the truth of God's existence might be distinguished in his mind from other beings, and that he might thus know the truth of God's existence, as it really is. God replied that it is beyond the mental capacity of a human creature, composed of body and soul, to obtain in this regard clear knowledge of the truth. The Almighty, however, imparted to Moses, what has been vouchsafed to no man before or since. Moses attained so much knowledge of the truth of the Divine Existence, that God was, in his mind, distinct from other beings, in the same way as an individual, whose back is seen, whose physical form and apparel are perceived, is distinguished in the observer's mind from the physical form of other individuals. And Scripture hints this in the text ""Thou shalt see My rearward but my face shall not be seen"" (Ex. 33:23)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.1.13,"11. Since it has been demonstrated that He is not a body, it is clear that none of the accidents of matter can be attributed to Him; neither conjunction nor separation, neither location nor dimension, neither ascent nor descent, neither right nor left, neither front nor rear, neither a sitting nor a standing posture. Nor does He exist in time, in the sense that He has either a beginning, end or definite number of years. Nor does He change, for there is nought in Him that would effect a change in Him. He does not die, nor has He life like that of an animal body. Folly is not an attribute of His Being, nor wisdom, like that of a wise man ; neither passion nor frivolity; neither joy nor melancholy; neither silence nor speech like that of human beings. And so the sages have said, ""Above, there is neither sitting nor standing, neither rigidity nor relaxation."""
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.1.14,"12. This being so, the expressions in the Pentateuch and books of the Prophets already mentioned, and others similar to these, are all of them metaphorical and rhetorical, as for example, ""He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh"" (Ps. 2:4), ""They have provoked me to anger with their vanities"" (Deut. 32:21), ""As the Lord rejoiced"" (Deut. 28:63), etc. To all these phrases, applies the saying ""The Torah speaks in the language of men."" So too, it is said ""Do they provoke Me to anger?"" (Jer. 7:19); and yet it is said ""I am the Lord, I change not"" (Malachi 3:6). If God was sometimes angry and sometimes rejoiced, He would be changing. All these states exist in physical beings that are of obscure and mean condition, dwelling in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust. Infinitely blessed and exalted above all this, is God, blessed be He."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.2.1,"This God, honoured and revered, it is our duty to love and fear ; as it is said ""Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God"" (Deut. 6:5), and it is further said ""Thou shalt fear the Lord, thy God"" (Deut. 6:13)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.2.2,"2. And what is the way that will lead to the love of Him and the fear of Him ? When a person contemplates His great and wondrous works and creatures and from them obtains a glimpse of His wisdom which is incomparable and infinite, he will straightway love Him, praise Him, glorify Him, and long with an exceeding longing to know His great Name ; even as David said ""My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God"" (Ps. 42:3). And when he ponders these matters, he will recoil affrighted, and realize that he is a small creature, lowly and obscure, endowed with slight and slender intelligence, standing in the presence of Him who is perfect in knowledge. And so David said ""When I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers——what is man that Thou art mindful of Him?"" (Ps. 8:4-5). In harmony with these sentiments, I shall explain some large, general aspects of the Works of the Sovereign of the Universe, that they may serve the intelligent individual as a door to the love of God, even as our sages have remarked in connection with the theme of the love of God, ""Observe the Universe and hence, you will realize Him who spake and the world was."""
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.2.3,"3. All that the Holy God, blessed be He, created in His universe falls into three divisions. Some are creatures consisting of substance and form, continuously coming into being and decaying. Such are bodies of human creatures and other animals, plants and minerals. Others are creatures consisting of substance and form which do not however like those of the first category, change, from one body to another or from one form to another, but retain their form permanently in their substance, not varying like the members of the former class. Such are the heavenly spheres and the stars placed in them. Their substance is not like other substances nor are their forms like other forms. Others again are creatures that consist of form without substance. These are the angels. For the angels are not material bodies, but only forms distinguished from each other."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.2.4,"4. What then is meant when the prophets say that they saw an angel of fire, possessing wings? Such descriptions are to be understood as prophetic visions and are to be taken in an allegorical sense. They are meant to indicate that the angel is not corporeal and has no gravity like bodies which have weight. Thus too, it is said ""For the Lord, thy God, is a devouring fire"" (Deut. 4:24). Yet God is not fire. The expression is a metaphor. Similarly it is said ""He makes his angels winds"" (Ps. 104:4)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.2.5,"5. In what way are these forms different from each other, seeing that they are incorporeal ? The answer is that, in their essential being, they are not equal. Each of them is below another and exists by the other's energy, and so, throughout, one angel being above the other. And all exist by the power and goodness of the Holy God, blessed be He. Solomon, in his wisdom, alludes to this in the text ""For higher than the high, One watcheth"" (Eccles. 5:7)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.2.6,"6. When we say that one angel is below another, this does not refer to position in space as when we think of an individual who occupies a higher seat than another, but to superiority in rank, as when one says in reference to two scholars, one of whom has more wisdom than the other, that he is the higher in degree, or when one says of the cause that it is higher than the effect."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.2.7,"7. The variety of names that the angels bear has reference to the difference in their rank. They are called <i>Hayoth Hakodesh</i>—these are the highest; <i>Ophanim, Erelim, Hashmalim, Seraphim. Malachim</i>: <i>Elohim, Bene Elohim, Cherubim</i> and <i>Ishim.</i> These ten names, by which the angels are called, correspond to their ten degrees. The highest rank, above which there is no degree higher but that of God, blessed be He, is that of the form called <i>Hayoth.</i> In the prophetic literature it is therefore said that the <i>Hayoth</i> are beneath the Throne of Glory. To the tenth degree, belongs the form of those termed <i>Ishim.</i> They are the angels that commune with the prophets and appear to them in the prophetic vision. They are called <i>Ishim</i> (individuals, men), because their rank approximates to that of the intelligence of human beings."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.2.8,"8. All these forms live, realize the Creator, and possess a knowledge of Him that is exceedingly great—a knowledge corresponding with the rank of each but having no relation to the infinite greatness of the Creator. Even the highest class of angels, cannot attain to a knowledge of the truth concerning God as He really is. For this, their capacities are insufficient. But the highest angelic form apprehends and knows more than the one below it; and so on, through all the degrees down to the tenth. This, too, knows God with a knowledge, to the like of which, human beings, consisting of matter as well as form, cannot attain. But hone of them knows the Creator as He knows himself."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.2.9,"9. All beings, except the Creator, from the highest angelic form to the tiniest insect that is in the interior of the earth, exist by the power of God's essential existence. And as He has self-knowledge, and realizes His greatness, glory and truth, He knows all, and nought is hidden from Him."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.2.10,"10. The Holy One, blessed be He, realizes His true being, and knows it as it is, not with a knowledge external to himself, as is our knowledge. For our knowledge and ourselves are separate. But as for the Creator, blessed be He, His knowledge and His life are One, in all aspects, from every point of view, and however we conceive Unity. If the Creator lived as other living creatures live, and His knowledge were external to Himself, there would be a plurality of deities, namely; He himself, His life, and His knowledge. This however, is not so. He is One in every aspect, from every angle, and in all ways in which Unity is conceived. Hence the conclusion that God is the One who knows, is known, and is the knowledge (of Himself)—all these being One. This is beyond the power of speech to express, beyond the capacity of the ear to hear, and of the human mind to apprehend clearly. Scripture, accordingly says ""By the life of Pharaoh"" and ""By the life of thy soul"" but not ""By the life of the Eternal"". The phrase employed is ""As God liveth""; because the Creator and His life are not dual, as is the case with the life of living bodies or of angels. Hence too, God does not apprehend creatures and know them because of them, as we know them, but He knows them because of Himself. Knowing Himself, He knows everything, for everything is attached to Him, in His Being."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.2.11,"11. What has been said on this topic in these two chapters is but a drop in the ocean, compared with what has to be elucidated on this subject. The exposition of all the principles alluded to in these two chapters forms the so-called <i>Maaseh Mercabah</i> — ""Account of the Divine Chariot"" (Ezekiel Chap. 1)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.2.12,"12. The ancient sages enjoined us only to discuss these subjects privately, with one individual, and then only if he be wise and capable of independent reasoning. In this case, the heads of the topics are communicated to him, and he is instructed in a minute portion of the subject. It is left to him to develop the conclusions for himself and to penetrate to the depths of the subject. These topics are exceedingly profound; and not every intellect is able to grasp them. Solomon, in his wisdom, said, in regard to them, by way of parable: ""The lambs<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*) A play upon <span dir=""rtl"">כבשׂים</span> which means ""lambs"" and <span dir=""rtl"">כבשׁים</span> ""secrets"".</i> will be for thy clothing"" (Prov. 27:26). Thus have the sages said, in the exposition of this parable, ""matters that deal with the mystery of the universe shall be for thy garment, that is, for thee alone; do not expound them in public"". So too, Solomon said concerning these topics ""Let them be for thee alone and not for strangers with thee"" (Prov. 5:17)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.2.13,"And he further said concerning these subjects ""Honey and milk are under thy tongue"" (Solomon's song 4:11). This text the ancient sages have thus explained, ""The things that are like milk and honey shall be under thy tongue""."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.3.1,"I. The spheres are entitled: Heaven, Firmament, Habitation and Celestial Clouds (Araboth). There are nine spheres. The one nearest to us is the Lunar sphere. The second above it is the sphere which contains the star called Mercury. Above this, is the third sphere, in which Venus moves. The fourth sphere is that to which the Sun belongs. The fifth, that of Mars; the sixth, that of Jupiter. The seventh, that of Saturn; the eighth, that in which move all the other stars that are visible in the sky; the ninth is the sphere which revolves daily from East to West."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.3.2,"II. It includes and encircles all things. That the stars seem all to be in the same sphere, though in reality they are at different altitudes, is due to the fact that the spheres are clear and transparent like glass or sapphire. Hence, the stars in the eighth sphere appear to be beneath the first sphere."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.3.3,"III. 2. Everyone of the eight spheres in which the stars move is divisible into numerous spheres, one above the other, like the several layers of onions. Some spheres revolve from west to east; others from east to west, as for instance, the ninth sphere, which moves from east to west. And between the spheres, no vacuum intervenes."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.3.4,"IV. 3. All of these spheres are neither light nor heavy. None of them is red, black or of any other colour. That they appear blue is an optical phenomenon, due to the height of the atmosphere. The spheres are tasteless and inodorous, these properties being found only in bodies that exist below them."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.3.5,"V. 4. All these spheres that encompass the world, are round like a globe, and the Earth is suspended in the centre. Some of the stars have small spheres in which they are fixed, and which do not revolve round the earth. But the small sphere which does not revolve round the earth is itself fixed in a large sphere which does revolve."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.3.6,"VI. 5. The number of all the spheres that revolve round the world is eighteen. The number of the small spheres that do not so revolve is eight. And from the courses of the stars, from their known daily and hourly rate of movement, from their declination from the south towards the north and from the north towards the south, from their height above the earth and their approximation to it, the number of these spheres can be ascertained, as well as the lines of their movement and the courses they traverse. This forms the Science of Mathematical Astronomy, on which the Greek sages composed many treatises."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.3.7,"VII. 6. The Ninth sphere which encompasses the universe was divided by the ancient sages into twelve parts. To each of these, they assigned a name according to the form which the stars exactly below that part seemed to assume. These are the Constellations that are respectively called Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.3.8,"VIII. 7. The Ninth Sphere itself has no division; none of these shapes, nor any star. It is only in grouping the stars in the eighth sphere, that they assume such forms or approximately so. These twelve forms were situated directly opposite these divisions only at the period of the Flood, when those names were given them. At present, they have somewhat shifted. For the stars in the Eighth Sphere all move like the Sun and Moon; but move slowly, so that a distance traversed by the Sun or Moon in a day takes one of these stars approximately seventy years to cover."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.3.9,"IX. 8. Of the visible stars, some are so small that the Earth is larger than any one of them; while others are so large that each of them is several times the size of the Earth. The magnitude of the Earth is about forty times that of the Moon. The magnitude of the Sun, one hundred and seventy times that of the Earth. Hence, the Sun is approximately six thousand and eight hundred times the size of the Moon. No star is larger than the Sun; nor smaller than a star in the second sphere."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.3.10,"X. 9. Every star and sphere has a soul and is endowed with knowledge and intelligence. They are living beings who apprehend 'Him who spake and the world was'. They praise and glorify their Creator, just as the angels do, each according to its greatness and degree. And as they apprehend God, so they are conscious of themselves and of the angels above them. The knowledge possessed by the stars and spheres, is less than that of angels, more than that of human beings."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.3.11,"XI. 10. Below the Sphere of the Moon, God created matter unlike that of the spheres. And for this matter, He created four forms which are unlike the form of the Spheres. Each of these forms was set in a different portion of this matter. The first of these forms—that of Fire—was combined with a part of the sublunary matter and the result was the actual body of fire. The second form—that of Air—was united with another portion and the result was the actual body of air. The third form—that of Water—was joined to another portion and the result was the actual body of water. The fourth form—that of Earth—was combined with another portion and the result was the actual body of earth. Thus beneath the firmament, there are four distinct bodies, one above the other; the higher completely surrounding those below it on all sides, like a sphere. The first, nearest the sphere of the Moon, is the body of Fire: beneath it, the body of Air; below this, the body of Water; below this again, the body of Earth. Between these bodies, there is no vacuum."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.3.12,"XII. 11. These four bodies are without souls. They have neither knowledge nor perception, and are thus like dead bodies. Each of them has a governing principle of which it has no knowledge nor apprehension, and which it cannot alter. And this is expressed by David in the text ""Praise the Lord from the Earth, ye sea-monsters and all depths; fire and hail, snow and vapours"" (Ps. 148:7-8). The meaning of the passage is: Praise Him, ye children of men, because of the manifestations of His might, which you see in fire, hail and the other created things beneath the sky; the power of which, old and young constantly perceive."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.4.1,"1. These four bodies, namely: fire, air, earth and water, are the basic elements of all created things that are beneath the firmament. All things—man and beast, bird, reptile, fish, plant, minerals, precious stones and pearls, stones for building, mountains and clods of earth are, as far as their matter is concerned, composed of these four elements. And accordingly, apart from the four elements, all bodies beneath the firmament are composed of a substance and form—this substance consisting of a combination of the four elements. Each of these four elements, however, consists of form and matter only."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.4.2,"2. The nature of fire and air is to ascend from below; that is, from the centre of the earth, upward towards the sky. The nature of water and earth is to move from beneath the sky downward, towards the centre, for the centre of the firmament is the lowest point beyond which there is no lower. Their movement is not conscious nor voluntary. It is a governing principle fixed in them and a nature impressed upon them. The nature of fire is hot and dry; this element is the lightest of all. Air is hot and moist; water, cold and moist; earth, dry and cold. This last is the heaviest of all the elements. Water is lighter than earth and is therefore found above the surface of the Earth. Air is lighter than water; hence, it blows above the water. Fire is lighter than air. And since these are the basic elements of all bodies that exist beneath the firmament, the substance of every such body, whether of man, beast—domestic and wild—bird, fish, plant, mineral, or stone, is made up of fire, air, water and earth. These four elements mingle and become changed at the time of their combination, so that the resulting compound bears no resemblance to any of them. In the compound, there is not a single particle that is fire alone, or water alone, or earth alone or air alone. All these elements have been transformed and fused into one body. Every such body possesses in itself, at one and the same time, the properties of cold and heat, moisture and dryness. But there are some in which the predominating element is fire, such as, for example, animals; in these, therefore, the quality of heat is particularly noticeable. In other bodies as, for instance, stones, earth is the predominant element. Hence, their marked feature is dryness. In other bodies again, water is the prevailing element; and their characteristic is humidity. Thus too, one body will be hotter than another which also has some heat; or drier than another which is also dry. So too, in some bodies, cold is marked; in others, moisture alone will be noticeable. In others again, cold and moisture, or cold and dryness, will be perceptible, in equal degree and at the same time; similarly with heat and dryness, or heat and humidity. In accordance with the proportion of an element in a compound, will its force and nature manifest itself in that compound."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.4.3,"3. Everything made up of these four elements, ultimately disintegrates. This process takes place in the case of some things after a few days; in the case of others, after several years. But everything compounded of them must inevitably revert to them. Even gold and the carnelian cannot but disintegrate and return to their original elements; part becoming fire; part, water; part, air; and part, earth."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.4.4,"4. Since everything that disintegrates dissolves into these elements, why was the first man especially told ""And unto <i>dust</i> shalt thou return"" (Gen. 3:19)? The reason is because the human structure consists, for the greater part, of dust. Everything, capable of decay, does not, during this process, immediately revert to its four elements. It frequently disintegrates and becomes another thing which, in its turn, changes into something else. At the end of these changes, it resolves into its elements. And so all things continually recur."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.4.5,"5. These four elements are ceaselessly, daily and hourly, changing into each other; but only partially, not completely. How so ? That part of earth which is nearest in its nature to water, alters, crumbles and becomes water; that part of water which is nearest in nature to air, becomes attenuated and turns into air; that portion of air most akin to fire, is transformed into fire. And so too, a reverse process takes place. That part of fire, which is nearest in nature to air, condenses and changes into air. That portion of air most akin to water, condenses and turns into water. That part of water most akin to earth, solidifies and becomes earth. These transmutations take place slowly, gradually and in the course of a long period. Nor does the whole of the element change to the extent that all the water in a body turns into air; or all the air into fire; for it is impossible that an element should altogether disappear; but part only turns from fire into air or <i>vice versa,</i> and such mutual changes take place in all the four elements in a perpetual cycle."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.4.6,"6. The changes arise from the movement of the Sphere. This causes the four elements to combine and produce other substances—those of human beings and other animals, vegetables, stones and minerals. To each of these substances God gives its suitable form through the angels of the tenth degree, called ""<i>Ishim</i>"", ""Individuals""."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.4.7,"7. You can never see matter without form, or form without matter. But the human mind divides in thought an existing body into its constituents and recognises that it is made up of matter and form. It also knows that in some objects, the matter is composed of the four elements; while in others, it is simple, consisting of one substance. The forms that are devoid of matter cannot be perceived with the physical eye but only with the mind's eye; in the same way as we are conscious of the Lord of the Universe, without physical vision."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.4.8,"8. The vital principle of all flesh is the form which God has given it. The superior intelligence in the human soul is the specific form of the mentally normal human being. To this form, the Torah refers in the text ""Let us make man in our image, after our likeness"" (Gen. 1:26). This means that man should have a form that knows and apprehends idealistic beings that are devoid of matter, such as the angels which are forms without substance, so that (intellectually) man is like the angels. The text, above quoted, does not refer to the visible features—the mouth, nose, cheeks, and other distinguishing bodily marks. These are comprehended in the nomenclature ""feature"". Nor does it refer to the vital principle in every animal by which it eats, drinks, reproduces, feels and broods. It is the intellect which is the human soul's specific form. And to this specific form of the soul, the Scriptural phrase ""in our image, after our likeness"" alludes. This form is frequently called ""<i>Nephesh"", ""Ruach""</i> (soul, spirit). One must therefore, in order to avoid mistakes, pay special attention to the meaning of these terms which, in each case, has to be ascertained from the context."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.4.9,"9. This form of the Soul is not compounded of elements into which it would again dissolve. Nor does it exist by the energy of the vital<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* vital principle—common to all animals.</i><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* vital principle—common to all animals.</i> principle so that the latter would be necessary to its existence, in the way that the vital principle requires a physical body, for its existence. But it comes directly from God in Heaven. Hence, when the material portion of our being dissolves into its component elements, and physical life perishes—since that only exists in association with the body and needs the body for its functions, this form of the Soul, is not destroyed, as it does not require physical life for its activities. It knows and apprehends the Intelligences that exist without material substance; it knows the Creator of All things; and it endures for ever. Solomon, in his wisdom, said, ""And the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit returneth to God who gave it"" (Eccles. 12:7)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.4.10,"10. The matters just discussed are like a drop in a bucket, and are very deep, but are not as deep as those treated in the First and Second Chapters. The exposition of the topics dealt with in the Third and Fourth Chapters, is termed <i>Maaseh Bereshith</i> (cosmogony). Our ancient sages enjoined us that these matters are not to be expounded in public, but should be communicated and taught to an individual privately."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.4.11,"11. What distinction is there between the <i>Maaseh Mercabah</i> (Ezek. I) and the <i>Maaseh Bereshith ?</i> The subject matter of <i>Maaseh Mercabah</i> is not expounded even to an individual unless he is wise and able to draw conclusions independently; and then, only the heads of the subjects are communicated to him. But the topics of the <i>Maaseh Bereshith</i> are taught to an individual; and even if he is unable to form independent conclusions we nevertheless teach him as much as he is capable of learning on these matters. Why is the subject not taught in public ? Because not every one possesses the breadth of intellect requisite for obtaining an accurate grasp of the meaning and interpretation of all its contents."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.4.12,"12. When a man reflects on these things, studies all these created beings, from the angels and spheres down to human beings and so on, and realises the Divine Wisdom manifested in them all, his love for God will increase, his soul will thirst, his very flesh will yearn, to love God. He will be filled with fear and trembling, as he becomes conscious of his own lowly condition, poverty and insignificance, and compares himself with any of the great and holy bodies; still more when he compares himself with any one of the pure forms that are incorporeal and have never had association with corporeal substance. He will then realise that he is a vessel full of shame, dishonour and reproach, empty and deficient."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.4.13,"13. The topics connected with these five precepts, treated in the above four chapters, are what our wise men called <i>Pardes,</i> (Paradise), as in the passage ""Four went into <i>Pardes""</i> (T.B. Chagiga 14). And although those four were great men of Israel and great sages, they did not all possess the capacity to know and grasp these subjects clearly. Therefore, I say that it is not proper to dally in <i>Pardes</i> till one has first filled oneself with bread and meat; by which I mean knowledge of what is permitted and what forbidden, and similar distinctions in other classes of precepts. Although these last subjects were called by the sages ""a small thing"" (when they say ""A great thing, <i>Maaseh Mercabah;</i> a small thing, the discussion of Abaye and Rava""), still they should have the precedence. For the knowledge of these things gives primarily composure to the mind. They are the precious boon bestowed by God, to promote social well-being on earth, and enable men to obtain bliss in the life hereafter. Moreover, the knowledge of them is within the reach of all, young and old, men and women; those gifted with great intellectual capacity as well as those whose intelligence is limited."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.1,"1. All the members of the house of Israel are commanded to sanctify the great Name of God, as it is said ""But I will be hallowed among the children of Israel"" (Lev. 22:32). They are furthermore cautioned not to profane it, as it is said ""Neither shall ye profane My holy Name"" (Lev. 22:32). How are these precepts to be applied? Should an idolater arise and coerce an Israelite to violate any one of the commandments mentioned in the Torah under the threat that otherwise he would put him to death, the Israelite is to commit the transgression rather than suffer death; for concerning the commandments it is said ""which, if a man do them, he shall live by them"" (Lev. 18:5): ""<i>Live</i> by them, and not die by them"". And if he suffered death rather than commit a transgression, he himself is to blame for his death."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.2,"2. This rule applies to all the commandments, except the prohibitions of idolatry, inchastity and murder. With regard to these: if an Israelite should be told ""transgress one of them or else you will be put to death"", he should suffer death rather than transgress. The above distinction only holds good if the idolater's motive is personal advantage; for example, if he forces an Israelite to build him a house or cook for him on the Sabbath, or forces a Jewess to cohabit with him, and so on; but if his purpose is to compel the Israelite to violate the ordinances of his religion, then if this took place privately and ten fellow-Israelites were not present, he should commit the transgression rather than suffer death. But if the attempt to coerce the Israelite to transgress was made in the presence of ten Israelites, he should suffer death and not transgress, even if it was only one of the remaining commandments that the idolater wished him to violate."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.3,"3. All the foregoing applies to a time free from religious persecution. But at a period when there is such persecution, such as when a wicked king arises like Nebuchednezzar and his confederates, and issues decrees against Israel, with the purpose of abolishing their religion or one of the precepts, then it is the Israelite's duty to suffer death and not violate any one, even of the remaining commandments, whether the coercion takes place in the presence of ten Israelites or in the presence of idolaters."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.4,"4. When one is enjoined to transgress rather than be slain, and suffers death rather than transgress he is to blame for his death. Where one is enjoined to die rather than transgress, and suffers death so as not to transgress, he sanctifies the name of God. If he does so in the presence of ten Israelites, he sanctifies the name of God publicly, like Daniel, Chananiah, Mishael and Azariah, Rabbi Akibah and his colleagues. These are the martyrs, than whom none ranks higher. Concerning them it is said, ""but for Thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter"" (Ps. 44:23). And to them also, the text refers, ""Gather my saints together unto Me, those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice"" (Ps. 50:5). Where one is enjoined to suffer death rather than transgress, and commits a transgression and so escapes death, he has profaned the name of God. If the transgression was committed in the presence of ten Israelites, he has profaned the name of God in public, failed to observe an affirmative precept—to sanctify the name of God—and violated a negative precept—not to profane His Name. Still, as the transgression was committed under duress, he is not punished with stripes and, needless to add, he is not sentenced by a court to be put to death, even if, under duress, he committed murder. For the penalty of death or stripes is only inflicted on one who transgresses of his own free will, in the presence of witnesses and after due warning. This rule is based on the text concerning one who has given of his seed to Molech. ""And I will set my face against <i>that</i> man"" (Leviticus 20:3). The demonstrative ""<i>that</i>"" has been traditionally interpreted as exempting from punishment one who transgresses under compulsion, in ignorance or in error. Now, if in the case of idolatry which is the gravest of offences, the (divine) penalty of Excision and, needless, to add, the judicial penalty of death are not incurred by one who worships an idol under compulsion; then how much more is this the rule in regard to the violation of the other precepts of the Torah. So too, in connection with offences against chastity, it is expressly stated, ""But unto the damsel<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*) who had been raped.</i> thou shalt do nothing"" (Deut. 22:26). However, if an individual is able to save himself and escape from the power of the wicked king and does not do so, he is like a dog that returns to its vomit. He is called a wilful idolater, is excluded from the world to come, and descends to the lowest depth of <i>Gehinnom.</i>"
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.5,"5. If heathens said to a group of Jewish women ""Surrender one of your number to us, that we may defile her, or else we will defile you all,"" they should all suffer defilement rather than surrender to them a single person in Israel. So too, if heathens said to Israelites, ""Surrender one of your number to us, that we may put him to death, otherwise, we will put all of you to death"", they should all suffer death rather than surrender a single Israelite to them. But if they specified an individual, saying ""Surrender that particular person to us, or else we will put all of you to death"", they may give him up, provided that he was guilty of a capital crime like Sheba, son of Bichri (who rebelled against David). But this rule is not told them in advance. If the individual specified has not incurred capital punishment, they should all suffer death rather than surrender a single Israelite to them."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.6,"6. The principle of non-liability in case of duress also applies to sickness. If one is dangerously sick, and the physicians assert that he can be cured by the application of a remedy which involves violation of a precept of the Torah, the remedy should be applied. Where life is in danger, anything forbidden in the Torah may be used as a curative agent, except the practice of idolatry, unchastity or murder. Even to save life, these offences must not be committed. If a patient transgressed the prohibition and recovered, the Court sentences him to the punishment prescribed for the offence."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.7,"7. Whence is the rule derived, that even when life is in danger, none of these three offences may be committed ? From the text, ""And thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might,"" (Deut. 6:5). This means that love for God has to be manifested even at the cost of life. As to taking the life of an Israelite, to cure another individual or to rescue a person from one who threatens violence, reason indicates that one human life ought not to be destroyed to save another human life. Offences against chastity are analogous to the destruction of human life; for it is said ""For, as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter."" (Deut. 22:26)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.8,"8. The rule that forbidden things may only be employed as remedies where there is danger to life, applies only to their use in the ordinary way in which food is enjoyed, as for instance, if a patient is prescribed a diet of ""abominable and crawling creatures (Lev. 11:29, 41, 43), or of leavened bread during Passover, or of any food on the Day of Atonement. But where forbidden things are to be used not in the ordinary way in which they are enjoyed, as for example, to apply on Passover a plaster or poultice, made of leaven, or one made of fruit of the first three years' produce of a tree at any time, or to drink a potion in which forbidden food is mingled with a bitter ingredient, so that the palate is not gratified—in all these cases the use of forbidden food is permitted even where there is no danger to life. Exceptions to this rule are the produce of mixed seed in a vineyard, and a dish of meat and milk cooked together. These may not be used even in ways other than those in which food is ordinarily enjoyed. Hence, even when not consumed as food, these may not be used as remedies, except where there is danger to life."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.9,"9. If a man set his eyes on a woman, fell sick and was nigh to death, and the physicians said that there was no cure for him, unless she cohabit with him,—let him die and let her not cohabit with him, even though she be unmarried. Nor is a decision given him that he may converse with her from behind a fence.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* where he does not see her</i> Let him die rather, and let not such a decision be rendered, so that the daughters of Israel shall not be regarded as unprotected—and thus the restraints of chastity would be loosened."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.10,"10. If one transgresses any of the commandments laid down in the Torah, of his own will and not under the stress of compulsion, but wantonly and in a spirit of provocation, he profanes the Name of God. And thus, in the text prohibiting false swearing, it is said, ""So thou wilt profane the name of thy God"". (Lev. 19:12). One who commits a transgression in the presence of ten Israelites is guilty of the public profanation of God's Name. On the other hand, whoever abstains from a transgression or fulfils a precept, not from any personal motive, not induced thereto by fear and apprehension or by the desire for honour, but solely for the sake of the Creator, blessed be He, as Joseph did when he resisted his master's wife, sanctifies the Name of God."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.11,"11. There are other things that are a profanation of the Name of God. When a man, great in the knowledge of the Torah and reputed for his piety does things which cause people to talk about him, even if the acts are not express violations, he profanes the Name of God. As, for example, if such a person makes a purchase and does not pay promptly, provided that he has means and the creditors ask for payment and he puts them off; or if he indulges immoderately in jesting, eating or drinking, when he is staying with ignorant people or living among them; or if his mode of addressing people is not gentle, or he does not receive people affably, but is quarrelsome and irascible. The greater a man is the more scrupulous should he be in all such things, and do more than the strict letter of the law requires. And if a man has been scrupulous in his conduct, gentle in his conversation, pleasant towards his fellow-creatures, affable in manner when receiving them, not retorting, even when affronted, but showing courtesy to all, even to those who treat him with disdain, conducting his commercial affairs with integrity, not readily accepting the hospitality of the ignorant nor frequenting their company, not seen at all times, but devoting himself to the study of the Torah, wrapped in <i>Talith</i> and crowned with phylacteries, and doing more than his duty in all things, avoiding however, extremes and exaggerations—such a man has sanctified God, and concerning him, Scripture saith, ""And he said unto me, 'Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified' "". (Is.49:3)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.12,CHAPTER VI.
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.13,"1. Whoever destroys any one of the holy and pure Names by which the Holy One, blessed be He, is called, incurs, according to scriptural enactment, the penalty of stripes; for referring to idol-worship, it is said, ""And ye shall destroy their name out of that place. Ye shall not do so unto the Lord, your God"" (Deut. 12:3-4)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.14,"2. There are seven such Names. The name written JHVH.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* JHVH and Adonai are pronounced alike, and are counted as <i>one name.</i></i> This is the Proper Name of the Deity, as it is also, when written Adonai; El; Eloah; Elohim; Elohé; or Elohai; Shaddai; Zebaoth. Whoever erases even a single letter of any of these seven Names is punished with stripes."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.15,"3. Prefixes to these Names may be erased; as, for example, <i>Lamed</i> in La'Adonai, <i>Beth</i> in Be'elohim, and so forth. These and similar prefixes have not the sanctity of the Names of God. But suffixes to the Divine Name, as for instance, final <i>Chaph</i> in Elohecha or <i>Chaph,</i> and final <i>Mem</i> in Elohechem etc., must not be erased. They are holy like the other letters of the Divine Name, which invests them with its own sanctity. Yet, notwithstanding that they have thus been sanctified, and it is forbidden to erase them, any one who does erase such suffixes does not incur the scriptural penalty of stripes, but receives the punishment of flagellation for contumacy."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.16,"4. Once <i>Aleph, Lamed</i> of Elohim or <i>Yod, He</i> of JHVH has been written, it may not be erased. The rule concerning the latter is obvious, since, besides being a holy name by itself, it is part of the Tetragrammaton. But if one has written <i>Shin, Daleth</i> of Shaddai or <i>Tsadi, Beth</i> of Zebaoth, these letters may be erased."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.17,"5. Other epithets used to praise God, such as <i>Gracious and Merciful, The Great, Mighty and Revered; The Faithful, Zealous and Powerful,</i> and so on, are like the rest of The Sacred Scriptures. The erasure of these terms is permitted."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.18,"6. If a vessel had a divine name inscribed on it, the portion with the Name should be cut out and hidden. If such a Name is even engraved on a plate or glass vessel, one melting the vessel is punished with stripes. The portion containing the Name should be cut out and hidden. So also, if a Divine Name is written on a man's flesh, he must not bathe, anoint himself, or stand in an unclean place. If occasion arises for taking a ritual bath, a reed should be wound over the Name and then the bath may be taken. If he has no reed, he is to wrap his garment about that part of his body on which the name is written, not however so tightly as to prevent the access of the water, the reason for this rule being that it is forbidden to stand nude in the presence of the Divine Name."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.19,"7. Whoever with destructive intent demolishes a single stone of the Altar, Sanctuary or any part of the Temple Court, is punished with stripes; as it is said in reference to idolatry, ""And ye shall break down their altars…. Ye shall not do so unto the Lord, your God."" (Deut. 12:3-4). So also, whoever with destructive intent kindles wood belonging to the Sanctuary, is punished with stripes; as it is said, ""And burn their groves with fire… Ye shall not do so to the Lord, your God."" (ibid. 12:3-4)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.20,"8. It is forbidden to burn or otherwise by one's act destroy any of the Sacred Scriptures, their commentaries or expositions. Whoever by his act does so destroy them, is punished with stripes for contumacy. This rule only applies to Scriptures written by an Israelite, conscious of their sacred character. But if an Israelite who is an infidel wrote a Scroll of the Torah, it is to be burnt with all the Names of God contained therein. The reason is that he does not believe in the sanctity of the Divine Name and did not write it for its sake, but regarded it like any other writing. This being his view, the Divine Name, which he wrote, never became sanctified. It is a religious duty to burn it, so as to leave no record of infidels or their works. But if a non-Israelite wrote the Divine Name, it is put away in a place of concealment. So also, copies of Holy Writ that have become worn out or that had been written by a non-Israelite, are to be put away in such a place."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.21,"9. All the names (of God) occurring in the account of the Life of Abraham are holy, including that in the text, ""O Lord, if I have found favour in thy sight."" (Gen. 18:3). All the Names (Adonai) in the Story of Lot are not holy, except the one in the text, ""Oh, not so, O Lord; behold, now, thy servant hath found grace in Thy sight"" (Gen. 19:18-19)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.5.22,"All the names (of God) occurring in the story of Gibeah of Benjamin (Judges ch. 20) are holy. Names of God in the story of Micah (Judges ch. 17) are not holy. Those in the story of Naboth (I Kings ch. 21) are holy. The name <i>Solomon,</i> wherever it occurs in the Song of Songs, is holy<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*) As allegorically it refers to God.</i> and is like other divine epithets. The one exception is that of the text ""Thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand"" (Canticles 8:12). Wherever the word <i>King</i> is found in the book of Daniel, it is a secular term except in the text, ""Thou art King, King of Kings"" (Dan. 2-37) where it is like other divine epithets."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.7.1,"1. It is one of the basic principles of religion that God inspires men with the prophetic gift. But the spirit of prophecy only rests upon the wise man who is distinguished by great wisdom and strong moral character, whose passions never overcome him in anything whatsoever, but who by his rational faculty always has his passions under control, and possesses a broad and sedate mind. When one, abundantly endowed with these qualities and physically sound, enters the ""Paradise""<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**) See above 4:13 for an explanation of this term.</i> and continuously dwells upon those great and abstruse themes,—having the right mind capable of comprehending and grasping them; sanctifying himself, withdrawing from the ways of the ordinary run of men who walk in the obscurities of the times, zealously training himself not to have a single thought of the vanities of the age and its intrigues, but keeping his mind disengaged, concentrated on higher things as though bound beneath the Celestial Throne, go as to comprehend the pure and holy forms <sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* spiritual beings.</i> and contemplating the wisdom of God as displayed in His creatures, from the first form to the very centre of the Earth, learning thence to realize His greatness—on such a man the Holy Spirit will promptly descend. And when the spirit rests upon him, his soul will mingle with the angels called <i>Ishim</i><sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">** Angels of the tenth, the lowest degree (See above, chapter 2, paragraph 7).</i>. He will be changed into another man and will realise that he is not the same as he had been, and has been exalted above other wise men, even as it is said of Saul ""And thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man."" (I Sam. 10:6)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.7.2,"2. The prophets are of various degrees. Just as one sage is greater in wisdom than another, so, in the gift of prophecy, one prophet is greater than another. All the prophets experienced prophetic manifestations only in dreams, at night, or by day after a deep sleep had fallen upon them; as it is said, ""I do make Myself known unto him in a vision. I do speak with him in a dream"" (Num. 12:6). At the time when they had the prophetic experience, their limbs trembled, their physical strength failed them, their thoughts became confused; and thus the mind was left free to comprehend the vision it saw, as is said in reference to Abraham, ""And 10, an horror of great darkness fell upon him"" (Gen. 15:12), and of Daniel, ""And my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength."" (Dan. 10:8)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.7.3,"3. The matters communicated to the prophet in a prophetic vision are communicated to him in allegorical form. Its interpretation is immediately impressed upon his mind, simultaneously with the vision, so that he grasps what it means. Such, for example, was the case with the vision the Patriarch Jacob saw (Gen. 28:12-15) of a Ladder with angels ascending and descending it—a type of the Monarchies and their oppression of Israel; the <i>Chaioth</i> in Ezekiel's vision (Ezek. Chap. 1); the Seething Cauldron (Jerem. 1:13) and the Rod of an Almond Tree (Jerem. 1:11) seen by Jeremiah; the Scroll seen by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 2:9) and the Ephah (measure) seen by Zechariah (Zech. 5:6) and so with the rest of the prophets. Some, like these prophets, recited the allegory together with its interpretation. Others only gave forth the interpretation. Sometimes, as in the case of some prophecies of Ezekiel and Zechariah, they only recited the allegory. All the prophets prophesied in allegories and riddles."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.7.4,"4. The prophets did not prophesy whenever they pleased, but had to concentrate their minds, resting, joyous and cheerful, and in solitude. For the spirit of prophecy does not descend upon one who is melancholy or indolent, but comes as a result of joyousness. And therefore, the Sons of the Prophets had before them psaltery, tabret, pipe and harp, (I Sam. 10:5) and thus sought a manifestation of the prophetic gift. This is expressed in the phrase, ""And they were <span dir=""rtl"">מתנבאים</span> (ibid. 10:5), which means, that they were on the way to prophesy, before they actually did so, as one might say, ""That person is becoming great."""
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.7.5,"5. Those who sought the prophetic gift were called Sons of the Prophets. Although they concentrated their minds, the Divine Spirit might or might not rest upon them."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.7.6,"6. The foregoing observations refer to the manner in which prophecy was vouchsafed to all the earlier and later prophets with the exception, however, of our teacher, Moses, the chief of all the prophets. In what respects was the prophecy of Moses distinguished from that of the other prophets ? All the prophets received their inspired messages in a dream or in a vision; Moses while awake and standing, as it is said, ""And when Moses went into the tent of meeting, that He might speak with him, then he heard the Voice speaking unto him"". (Num. 7:89). All the prophets received their messages through the medium of an angel. Hence, what they saw, they saw as an allegory or riddle—Moses received his message not through an angel, as it is said, ""Mouth to mouth will I speak with him"" (Num. 12:8), ""The Lord spake unto Moses face to face"" (Exod. 33:11); furthermore ""And the similitude of the Lord doth he behold"" (Num. 12:8); that is to say, that it was no allegory that was revealed to Moses but he realized the prophetic message clearly, without riddle and without parable. To this, the Torah testifies in the text, ""Even manifestly, not in dark speeches"" (Num. 12:8), which means that he received his prophecy not as a riddle, but had a clear and lucid vision. All the prophets (when receiving their messages) were filled with fear and consternation and became physically weak. Not so, our teacher Moses, of whom scripture says, ""As a man speaketh unto his neighbour."" (Ex. 33:11). Just as a man is not startled when he hears the words of his fellow-man, so the mind of Moses was vigorous enough to comprehend the words of prophecy while retaining his normal state. None of the prophets could prophesy at their pleasure. It was otherwise with Moses. He was invested with the prophetic spirit and was clothed with the power of prophecy whenever he pleased. There was no need for him specially to concentrate his mind and prepare for the prophetic manifestations; since he was ever intent and in readiness like the ministering angels. He therefore prophesied at all times; as it is said, ""Stand ye still and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you."" (Num. 9:8). In this regard God made him a special promise, as it is said, ""Go, say unto them: 'Return ye to your tents. But as for thee, stand thou here by me' "". (Deut. 5:27-28). Hence it may be inferred that all the prophets, when the prophetic power left them, returned to their tents, that is, attended to the satisfaction of their physical needs. Moses, our teacher, never went back to his former tent. He accordingly permanently separated himself from his wife, and abstained from similar gratifications. His mind was closely attached to the Rock of the Universe. The Divine Glory never departed from him; the skin of his face sent forth rays of light, and he was sanctified like the angels."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.7.7,"7. The gift of prophecy may be vouchsafed to a prophet, intended for him alone, to develop his mind and increase his knowledge, so that he may know what hitherto he had not known concerning exalted themes. Sometimes the prophet is sent on a special mission to a particular people or to the inhabitants of a certain city or kingdom, to direct them aright, teach them what they are to do or restrain them from the evil courses they were pursuing. And when so sent, a sign or token may be given him, so that the people might know that God had in truth sent him. Not every one showing a sign or token is on that account to be accepted as a prophet. Only if a man, by reason of his wisdom and conduct wherein he stands preeminent among his contemporaries, is already recognised as worthy of the prophetic gift, and his life, in its sanctity and renunciation, is favourable to the prophetic calling,—then, when he shows a sign or token and asserts that God had sent him, is it one's duty to listen to his message, as it is said, ""Unto him ye shall hearken"". (Deut. 18:15). It is, however, possible that such a man may show a sign and token and yet not be a prophet. The sign may be a mystery. Nevertheless, it is a duty to listen to him, for, being a great and wise man, worthy of the prophetic gift, we give him the benefit of the presumption. For thus too are we enjoined to decide a suit on the evidence of two competent witnesses. Though it is possible that they may have given false testimony, still having accepted them as competent witnesses, we rely on their qualification. On these and such like matters, it is said, ""The secret things belong unto the Lord, our God; but the things that are revealed, belong unto us and to our children"" (Deut. 29:28). And further it is said, ""For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart"" (I. Sam. 16:7)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.8.1,"1. Israel did not believe in Moses, our Teacher, on account of the tokens he showed. For when one's faith is founded on tokens, a lurking doubt always remains in the mind that these tokens may have been performed with the aid of occult arts and witchcraft. All the signs Moses showed in the Wilderness, he performed because they were needed, and not to support his prophetic claims. Thus, when it was necessary that the Egyptians should be drowned, he divided the Red Sea and drowned them in its depths. We needed material sustenance; he brought down the Manna for us. The people thirsted; he clave the rock for them. Korah's company denied his authority; the earth swallowed them up. And so with all the other tokens. What then were the grounds of the faith in him ? The Revelation on Sinai which we saw with our own eyes, and heard with our own ears, not having to depend on the testimony of others, we ourselves witnessing the fire, the thunder, the lightning, Moses entering the thick darkness after which the Divine Voice spoke to him, while we heard the call, ""Moses, Moses, go, tell them thus and thus"". And so it is said, ""The Lord spoke with you, face to face"" (Deut. 5:4); and furthermore, ""The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers only, [but with us, <i>even us,</i> who are all of us here alive this day""] (Deut. 5:3). Whence do we know that the Sinaitic Revelation is the sole proof that Moses' prophetic mission is true ? From the text, ""Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe in thee for ever."" (Ex. 19:9). Hence the inference that before that event they did not believe with a faith that would endure for ever, but only with a faith followed by hesitating and doubting speculation."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.8.2,"2. As those to whom Moses was sent, were themselves witnesses to the truth of his prophecy, there was no need for him to show them any other sign, since they and he were witnesses to the same matter. They were like two persons who saw an event together. When giving their testimony in such a case, each of them is a witness that the other is telling the truth, and neither need bring proof of the credibility of the other. So was it with Moses, our Teacher. After the Revelation on Sinai, all Israel became witnesses for him; and there was no need for him to show them any further sign. The Almighty indicated this to Moses at the beginning of the latter's career, when He gave him signs which he was to perform in Egypt, and said to him, ""They shall hearken to thy voice"" (Ex. 3:18). Moses realised that belief based on signs leaves lurking doubts and is followed by musings and speculation. He therefore sought to avoid the acceptance of his mission, and said, ""But 10, they will not believe me"" (Ex. 4:1), till the Almighty informed him that these signs were only to serve till our ancestors had departed from Egypt. ""And when they will have gone forth and stand at the foot of this mountain,"" God said to Moses, ""their doubts about thee will disappear. For here, I will give thee a sign by which they will know that it was I who sent thee from the first, and no vestige of doubt will linger in their mind"". And this is what is meant in the text, ""And this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee; when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God at this mountain"" (Ex. 3:12). Hence one may conclude with regard to every prophet after Moses, that we do not believe in such a prophet because of the signs he shows, as much as to say that only if he shows a sign, we shall pay heed to him in all that he says, but we believe in him, because of the charge laid down by Moses in the Torah that if the prophet gives a sign ""ye shall listen to him""; just as the Lawgiver directed that a cause is to be decided on the evidence of two witnesses even if we have no certainty as to whether they are testifying to the truth or to a falsehood. Similarly, it is our duty to listen to the prophet though we do not know if the sign he shows is genuine or has been performed with the aid of sorcery and by secret arts."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.8.3,"3. Hence too, if a prophet were to arise and perform signs and wonders, and seek to deny the prophetic character of Moses, our teacher, we would not have to listen to him and would be clearly certain that those signs were wrought by secret arts and witchcraft. For Moses' authority as a prophet is not founded upon signs, in which case we might have weighed the signs of one prophet against those of another. But with our eyes we saw and with our ears we heard the divine Voice, even as he (the claimant to prophecy) also heard it. To what may this be compared? To persons testifying in the presence of a man concerning an incident which he saw with his own eyes and denying that it took place as he saw it. He will surely not accept their statement, but will be convinced that they are false witnesses. The Torah accordingly ordains that even if the sign or token takes place, you are not to listen to the words of such a prophet; since he shows a sign and token in order to deny what you saw with your own eyes. As we only accept signs (as a prophet's credentials) because we are so bidden in the commandment given us by Moses, how shall we, on the strength of such a sign, accept a man as a prophet, who seeks to repudiate Moses' prophecy for the truth of which we have the evidence of our own eyes and ears ?"
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.9.1,"1. It is clearly and explicity set forth in the Torah that its ordinances will endure for ever without variation, diminution or addition; as it is said, ""All this word which I command you, that shall ye observe to do; thou shalt not add to it, nor take away from it"" (Deut. 13:1); and further it is said ""but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this Law"" (Deut. 29:28). Hence the inference that to fulfil all the behests of the Torah is an obligation incumbent upon us for ever, as it is said, ""It is an everlasting statute throughout your generations"". (Lev. 23:14, Num. 18:23). It is also said, ""It is not in heaven"" (Deut. 30:12). Hence the inference that a prophet is forbidden to make innovations in the Torah. Accordingly, if any one should arise, whether among the Gentiles or among the Israelites, and, showing a sign and token, declare that God had sent him to add a precept to the Torah or take away a precept from the Torah, or give an interpretation to any of the commandments, such as we had not heard from Moses; or should assert that the commandments ordained to Israel are not of perpetual obligation for all generations but only temporary, such a man is a false prophet, because he sets out to deny the prophecy of Moses. He is to be put to death by strangling because he spoke perversely in the name of God that which God had not bidden him, for the Lord enjoined Moses that this Commandment shall be unto us and to our children after us for ever. And God is not a man that he should lie."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.9.2,"2. Since this is so, why is it said in the Torah, ""I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee"" (Deut. 18:18)? The answer is that the prophet here referred to, will come, not to found a religion, but to charge the people concerning the words of the Torah and exhort them not to transgress it; as the last of the prophets expressed it, ""Remember ye the law of Moses, My servant"" (Malachi 3:22). And so, if the prophet gives an order in regard to things permissible, as for instance, if he says ""Go to that place"" or ""Do not go to it"", ""Wage war today"" or ""Do not wage war"", ""Build this wall"" or ""Do not build it"", it is a duty to obey him. Whoever transgresses his instructions incurs the penalty of death by the hand of God, as it is said, ""And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto the words of the prophet which he shall speak in My Name, I will require it of him."" (Deut. 18:19)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.9.3,"3. So too, a prophet who acts contrary to his own exhortations or suppresses the prophetic message he is charged to deliver, incurs the penalty of death by the hand of God. To all the above three offences applies the text ""I will require it of him"" (Deut. 18:19). So also, if one, who is known to us as a prophet, bids us transgress on a certain occasion any precept of the Torah or several such precepts—whether minor or major—it is our duty to obey him. For thus were we taught by the ancient sages, on the authority of tradition, that if the prophet tells you to transgress the precepts of the Torah, as Elijah did on Mount Carmel, obey him in all matters, unless the commandment be to worship idols; this is the rule however only when the prophet's instruction is for a single occasion. Such was the case of Elijah at Mount Carmel. He offered up burnt offerings outside the Temple, while the Sanctuary in Jerusalem was the place appointed for such sacrifices, and any one who offered them up outside the appointed place incurred the penalty of excision. But because Elijah was a prophet, it was obligatory to heed him, and even in the above case, the rule applied ""Unto him shall ye hearken"" (Deut. 18:15). If Elijah's contemporaries had asked him, ""How dare we abrogate the precept, ""Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy offering in any place….""(Deut. 12:13), the prophet would have replied, ""This verse only refers to one who constantly offers up sacrifices outside the Sanctuary; such a person incurs the penalty of excision prescribed by Moses. But <i>I</i> propose to offer up sacrifices outside the Temple, this day only, by the express commandment of God, for the purpose of discrediting the prophets of Baal."" And thus, if prophets order the violation of a precept for a set time, it is a duty to obey the direction. But if they declare that the precept is abrogated for ever, they incur the penalty of death by strangling, for the Torah said ""Unto us and to our children for ever"". (Deut. 29:28)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.9.4,"4. So too, if a prophet attempts to rescind any of the institutions that have come down to us by tradition, or if, in reference to a moot point, he asserts that the Almighty had instructed him as to what was the decision and that the rule was according to the view of a certain teacher, he is a false prophet, and should be strangled, even if he showed a token, since he proposes to deny the Torah which has laid down the principle ""It is not in Heaven"" (Deut. 30:12). But if his direction be only for a single occasion, we obey him in all things."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.9.5,"5. These rules apply to all precepts but not to the prohibition of idolatry. If a prophet bids us worship idols even on a single occasion, we are not to listen to him. And though he performs great signs and wonders, if he says that the Almighty commanded him that an idol should be worshipped this day only or this hour only, he speaks perversely against the Eternal. Scripture charges us in such a case, ""And even if the sign or wonder come to pass… thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet…., because he hath spoken perversely against the Lord, your God"". (Deut. 13:3-4-6). Since he seeks to discredit the teaching of Moses, we know for certain that he is a false prophet; and whatever he did, was done by secret arts and with the aid of witchcraft, and he is to be strangled."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.10.1,"1. A prophet who arises and declares that God sent him, does not need to show a sign like any of the wonders performed by Moses, Elijah or Elisha,—all of which involved changes in the ordinary course of nature. A sufficient sign for him would be if he foretold events that would happen in the world and his predictions came true, as it is said, ""And if thou say in thy heart: 'How shall we know the word which the Lord hath spoken, etc.'"" (Deut. 18:21). Accordingly, when a man worthy to be a prophet, comes professedly as a messenger of God, and proposes neither to add to the Law nor to take aught from it, but only exhorts his hearers to serve God by obedience to the precepts of the Torah, we do not say to him ""Divide for us the sea, or restore a dead person to life, or perform similar miracles, and then we will believe in you;"" but we say to him ""Foretell coming events"". If he does so, we wait to see whether his predictions are fulfilled or not. And if they fail of realisation in the smallest particular, he is manifestly a false prophet. But if everything he said comes true, then he must be accepted by us as trustworthy."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.10.2,"2. He is to be tested repeatedly. If all his words are found worthy of credence, he is a true prophet, as is said of Samuel ""And all Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord."" (I. Sam. 3:20)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.10.3,"3. But observers of the times and diviners also predict the future. What is the difference, then, between them and the prophet ? The answer is that in the case of the observers of the times, diviners, and their like, part of what they say comes true while part is not fulfilled, as it is said, ""Let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, prognosticators of [some] new things that shall befall thee, arise and save thee"" (Is. 47:13). ""Of [some] new things"", but not all new things. Possibly too, none of their forecasts will come true; and they may prove wholly mistaken, as it is said, ""that frustrateth the tokens of impostors, and maketh diviners mad"" (Is. 44:25). But as for the prophet,—all his words come true, as it is said, ""Nothing of the word of the Lord shall fall to the earth"" (II Kings 10:10), and again it is said, ""The prophet that hath My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What hath chaff to do with the wheat, saith the Lord"". (Jer. 23:28). This means that the words of the diviners are like chaff with which a little wheat has become mixed, but the word of God is like pure wheat, wholly free from chaff. And herein Scripture gave an assurance and declared that in all those matters on which the soothsayers and the diviners, professing to instruct nations, tell falsehoods, the prophet will give you true knowledge, so that you do not need soothsayer or diviner or the like, as it is said, ""there shall not be found among you anyone that maketh his son or his daughters to pass through the fire, [or that useth divination, or soothsayer or enchanter""] (Deut. 18:10), ""for these nations that thou art to dispossess hearkened unto soothsayers and unto diviners; but as for thee, the Lord, thy God, hath not suffered thee so to do"" (Deut. 18:14). And the text continues, ""A prophet will the Lord, thy God, raise up unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren [like unto me; unto him shall ye hearken""] (Deut. 18:15). Hence we learn that the prophet only has to predict coming events, as to whether there will be plenty or famine, war or peace, etc. He even may instruct an individual in regard to his private affairs; as in the instance of Saul who had suffered a loss and repaired to the prophet to tell him where the strayed asses were. To tell these and such like things is among the prophet's functions, but not to found a new religion, add a commandment to the Law or take a commandment from it."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.10.4,"4. As to calamities predicted by a prophet, if, for example, he foretells the death of a certain individual or declares that in a particular year there will be famine or war, and so forth, the non-fulfilment of his forecast does not disprove his prophetic character. We are not to say, ""See, he spoke, and his prediction has not come to pass"". For God is long-suffering and abounding in kindness, and repents of the evil (He threatened). It may also be that those who were threatened repented and were forgiven, as happened to the men of Nineveh. Possibly too, the execution of the sentence is only deferred, as in the case of Hezekiah. But if the prophet, in the name of God, assures good fortune, declaring that a definite event would come to pass, and the benefit promised has not been realised, he is unquestionably a false prophet; for no blessing decreed by the Almighty, even if promised conditionally, is ever revoked. We do not find that God ever revoked aught good that He had promised; except at the destruction of the First Temple, when he promised the righteous that they would not perish with the wicked and changed his purpose. The explanation is given in the Talmudical Treatise Sabbath.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">* Sabbath 55. ""The righteous suffered with the wicked for their failure to reprove the latter"".</i> Hence we learn that only when he predicts good fortune can the prophet be tested. Jeremiah expressed this in his reply to Hananiah, son of Azur, when the former prophesied evil while the latter prophesied good. Jeremiah said to Hananiah: ""If my words are not confirmed by events, that will not prove that I am a false prophet. But should your predictions not be fulfilled you will be proved a false prophet; as it is said, ""Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak,…. the prophet that prophesied of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him"" (Jer. 28:7-9)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.10.5,"5. A prophet whose prophetic status has been attested by another (recognised) prophet is to be accepted as such and no further investigation is needed. For Moses vouched for Joshua whom all Israel recognised as a prophet even before he had shown any sign. And so in every period, when a prophet is known, and his messages have repeatedly been accepted, or when a prophet is vouched for by another prophet, and conducts himself consistently with the prophetic calling, he must not be made the subject of speculation and misgivings in regard to the character of his prophecy. Nor may we test him excessively. We must not be continually investigating his claims, as it is said, ""Ye shall not tempt the Lord, your God, as you tempted Him at Massah"" (Deut. 6:16), where the people asked, ""Is the Lord among us or not?"" (Ex. 17:7). Once it is known that a particular individual is a prophet, they must believe and know that God is in their midst and not harbour doubt or suspicion concerning him; as it is said, ""And they shall know that there hath been a prophet among them."" (Ezek. 2:5)."
Laws of Foundations of the Torah.10.6,Blessed be the All-Merciful who aided us.
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.1","1. It is an affirmative precept of the Torah to say Grace after a meal, as it is said, ""And thou shalt eat and be satisfied and shalt bless the Lord, thy God"" (Deuteronomy 8:10). The Torah only imposes the obligation on a person when he is satisfied; for it is said, ""When thou hast eaten and art satisfied, thou shalt bless etc."" According to the ordinances of the sages, however, even if one has eaten only as much food as the size of an olive, he recites Grace after the meal."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.2","2. It is also an ordinance of the Sages that before partaking of any food, a blessing is first recited and then it is eaten. And however little one intends to eat or drink, the blessing is first recited and then the refreshment is taken. So too, one who wishes to smell a fragrant odor first recites the blessing and then enjoys the fragrance. Whoever partakes of any enjoyment without reciting a blessing commits a trespass. It is also an ordinance of the sages that a blessing is to be recited after eating or drinking, provided that the quantity drunk is at least a quarter of a <i>log</i> (equal to the volume of an egg and a half), and the food eaten is at least as much as an olive in size. A cook who is tasting food does not need to recite a blessing before or after doing so, provided that the quantity tasted is less than a quarter of a <i>log.</i>"
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.3","3. And just as blessings are recited when partaking of material enjoyments, so when about to fulfill any precept, a blessing is said, after which the precept is performed. The sages have moreover instituted several blessings of praise and thanksgiving and petition, in order that when not partaking of material enjoyments nor engaged in the fulfillment of religious duties we should constantly have God in mind. All blessings accordingly fall into three kinds; blessings recited when partaking of material enjoyments, blessings recited when fulfilling religious duties, and blessings of thanksgiving, which have the character of praise, thanksgiving and supplication, and the purpose of which is that we should always have the Creator in mind and revere Him."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.4","4. The forms of all the blessings were established by Ezra and his Court. It is not proper to vary them, or add to or take aught away from any one of them. Whoever deviates from the form which the Sages have given to the Blessings, is in error. Any blessing in which the name of God and His Sovereignty are not mentioned is not regarded as a blessing, unless it follows immediately another blessing."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.5","5. All blessings may be recited in any language, provided that the form instituted by the sages is followed. And if the form has been changed, the duty of reciting the blessing is discharged, since the name of God and His sovereignty as well as the subject matter of the blessing have been mentioned, even though in a foreign tongue."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.6","6. All blessings should be so recited that the reciter hears what he is saying. But if he has not recited the blessings so that he can hear them, he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty, whether he uttered them with his lips or recited them mentally."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.7","7. There must be no interruption between the recital of any blessing and that for which it is recited. If such an interruption has taken place, the blessing must be repeated. If the interruption was in connection with matters appertaining to the blessing, the blessing need not be recited a second time. For example, a person recites the blessing over bread; and, before he eats it, says ""Bring salt"", ""bring the cooked course"", ""give food to So and So"", ""Feed the cattle"", he need not recite the blessing a second time. The same is the rule in similar cases."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.8","8. All blessings may be recited by one ritually unclean, whether the uncleanness is of such a nature that he can free himself of it the same day or not. It is forbidden to a male to recite blessings while in a nude state."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.9","9. Blessings, even when they have already been recited by a person in fulfillment of his obligation, may be said by him, a second time, on behalf of others who have not said them, so as to free them of their obligation. Blessings recited on partaking of refreshments, when this is not a religious duty, form an exception. A person may only recite the blessings on behalf of others, when he also partakes of the refreshment. But when the refreshment is also a religious duty, as, for instance, eating unleavened bread on the first nights of Passover, eating bread or drinking wine at the inauguration of Sabbath and Festival, a person may recite the blessings for others who eat and drink, without having to join them."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.10","10. He who hears any blessing from beginning to end, with the intent to fulfill his obligation (to recite that blessing) has fulfilled his obligation, even if he has not responded ""Amen"". Whoever responds Amen after a blessing has been said is in the same category with the reciter, provided that the latter was under the obligation of saying such a blessing. If the reciter's obligation was only Rabbinical, while the respondent's was Scriptural, the latter does not fulfill his duty unless he responds Amen or listens to the recital of the blessing by one who is under a scriptural obligation."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.11","11. When several persons had agreed to eat bread or drink wine in company, and one of them recited the blessing, while all the rest responded ""Amen"", they are permitted to eat and drink. If, however they had not intended to have a meal together but each came (without preconcerted arrangement) even though they should be eating of the same loaf, each of them recites the blessing for himself. This rule refers to bread and wine only. The consumption of other foods and beverages does not require an agreement to form one party. If any one of those present recites the blessing and the rest respond ""Amen"", they may all eat and drink, even if originally they had had no intention to form one company."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.12","12. Whoever hears an Israelite recite a blessing has to respond ""Amen"", even if he has not heard the entire blessing from beginning to end, and even if he himself is not under an obligation to recite that blessing. If however the reciter was an idolater, a free thinker (Epikoros), a Samaritan, a child practising blessings, or an adult who deviated from the fixed form of the blessing, no response of Amen is made."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.13","13. Whoever responds ""Amen"", must not utter it with the first or last letter clipped, or unduly hurried or drawn out, but should utter it in the way it is ordinarily pronounced. He should not raise his voice above that of the reciter of the blessing. A person who is under an obligation to recite a blessing and has not heard it recited by another may not join the hearers in responding Amen."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.14","14. Whoever recites a blessing unnecessarily takes the name of God in vain and is like one who swears in vain. After such a blessing it is forbidden to respond Amen. But children are taught the blessings in their regular form. Although while they are learning, they recite the blessings without due occasion, this is permitted. There must however be no response (of Amen) to such recitals, nor does any one who responds Amen discharge his obligation if he had occasion to recite such blessings."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.15","15. Whoever responds Amen to the blessings which he himself says acts objectionably; but to add Amen to the last of concluding blessings is laudable; as, for instance, after the phrase, ""Who rebuildeth Jerusalem"" in the Grace after meals, or after the last of the blessings recited after the <i>Shema</i> in the Evening Service, or at the close of the concluding blessings the reciter responds Amen to his own recital of the blessings."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.16","16. Why does one respond ""Amen"" to the blessing ending ""Who rebuildeth Jerusalem"", seeing that it is followed by the benediction, ""Who is kind and dealeth kindly""? Because this last named benediction was instituted in the times of the Sages of the Mishna, and is in the nature of a supplement, while the essential portion of the Grace after meals ends with the formula, ""Who rebuildeth Jerusalem."" Why does one not respond ""Amen"" to the blessing beginning, ""With everlasting love""? Because it is the conclusion of the blessings preceding the recital of the <i>Shema.</i> The rule is the same with all blessings said before any act; as, for instance those said before reading the Scroll of Esther or those said before kindling the Hanucah Lights, so that there should be no interruption between the recital of the blessings and the act for which the reciter said the blessings."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.17","17. Why does one not add ""Amen"" to the blessing one has said on partaking of fruit etc.? Because it is a single blessing, and Amen is only added to a final blessing, when preceded by one or more blessings; for example, the blessings recited by the King or the High Priest,<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Mentioned in Mishnah Sotah, chapter I, paragraph 1 and set forth in detail in paragraphs 7 and 8. Paragraph 7:—Blessings recited after reading by the High Priest, or someone else, in his presence, during the night of the Day of Atonement, sections from the Book of Leviticus appertaining to the Day (Leviticus ch. 16 and ch. 23:26-32). Paragraph 8:—Blessings after recital in public of passages from the Book of Deuteronomy, on the second evening of the Feast of Tabernacles after the close of the Sabbatical year. This in accordance with the precept (Deuteronomy 31:10-13). The reading was done in the courtyard of the Temple on Mount Zion. The King was the Reader. If there was no King, the chief leader of the people was the reader. The passages read were Deuteronomy 1:1 till 6:9; 11:13 till 11:21; 14:22 till 14:29; 26:12 till 26:15, 17:15 till 17:20; chapter 28; and 17:15 till 17:20 were repeated.</i> the addition of the Amen in these cases indicating that all the blessings had been completed."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.18","18. Whoever eats forbidden food, wilfully or in error—recites no blessing either before or after. For example, if one eats of that which is Rabbinically regarded as <i>Tevel</i> (produce from which priest's dues and Levite's tithes should have been, but had not been separated), or eats Levite's tithes from which the priest's dues (two per cent by the original owners, and ten per cent by the Levite of his portion) had not been taken, or eats (outside Jerusalem) Second tithes (which should be consumed in Jerusalem), or consumes that which had been set apart for the Sanctuary and had not been properly redeemed, he does not recite the blessings for the food. Needless it is to add that no blessing is recited if flesh is eaten of a beast that was not properly slain or was pronounced unfit for consumption by Jews owing to a lesion, or if wine is drunk that is forbidden to Jews etc."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.1.19","19. But if one eats <i>Demai</i> (produce bought from those concerning whom it is doubtful whether they give the tithe), or of the Levite's tithe from which the priest's dues given by the Levite have been separated, but not the proportion of priest's dues, which should have been given by the original owner, provided that the Levite took his tithe while the grain was still in the ear, or of the Second Tithe, or of that which was devoted to the Sanctuary and has been redeemed, but without the addition of an extra fifth of the value—in these, and all similar cases, the blessings, both before and after partaking of the food, are said."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.1","1. The order of the Grace after meals is as follows: The first blessing is that beginning ""Who feedeth""; the second is the blessing for the Promised Land; the third, that ending ""Who rebuildeth Jerusalem""; the fourth, that beginning ""Who is good and doeth good"". The first blessing was instituted by Moses, our teacher; the second, by Joshua; the third, by David and Solomon, his son; the fourth, by the Sages of the Mishna."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.2","2. Laborers when taking a meal during the time that they are working for an employer, do not recite the blessing before the meal, so that they may not neglect his work, and only recite two blessings after it. The first of these two blessings is recited in its regular form. The second begins with the blessing for the Promised Land, includes a reference to the blessing, ""Who will rebuild Jerusalem"" and ends with the concluding formula of the second blessing, ""Blessed art thou, O Lord, for the land and the food."" If however the workmen's sole wage is their board, or if their employer takes the meal with them, they recite all the four blessings of the Grace after meals in their complete form as others do."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.3","3. The blessing for the Promised Land must begin and end with thanksgiving and its concluding formula is ""for the land and for the food"". Whoever omits in this blessing the phrase, ""a land, desirable, good and ample"" has not fulfilled his duty. The Abrahamic covenant and the Torah must also be mentioned in it. The reference to the Covenant must come first, since the covenant referred to in the benediction for the land is the rite of circumcision in connection with which there were thirteen covenants, while in connection with the Torah there were only three, as it is said, ""These are the words of the Covenant"" (Deuteronomy 28:69); ""beside the Covenant which He made with them in Horeb"" (ibid. 28:69); ""Ye stand this day … that thou shouldst enter into the Covenant (ibid. 29:9-11)."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.4","4. The third blessing begins, ""Have mercy, O Lord our God, upon us and upon Israel, Thy people, and upon Jerusalem Thy city, and upon Zion, the abiding place of Thy glory""; or ""Comfort us, O Lord our God, in Jerusalem, Thy city"", and concludes, ""Who will rebuild Jerusalem"" or ""Who will comfort His people Israel in the rebuilding of Jerusalem"". This benediction is accordingly styled ""Comfort"". Whoever has not mentioned in it the Sovereignty of the House of David has not fulfilled his duty. For this constitutes the very essence of the blessing. Israel's consolation will only be a complete consolation when the House of David will be restored to Sovereignty."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.5","5. On Sabbaths and Festivals, one begins [this blessing] and concludes it with Consolation, and includes a reference to the special holy character of the day. One begins, ""Comfort us, O Lord our God, in Zion Thy city""; or ""Have mercy, O Lord our God upon Israel, Thy people, and upon Jerusalem, Thy city"", and ends, ""Who comfortest Thy people Israel in the rebuilding of Jerusalem"", or ""Who rebuildest Jerusalem"". In the middle of the blessing one adds, ""O our God and God of our fathers, be pleased to fortify us by Thy commandments, and especially by the commandment of this great and holy seventh day, (since this day is great and holy before Thee<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Omitted in the manuscript but included in the extant editions.</i><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Omitted in the manuscript but included in the extant editions.</i><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Omitted in the manuscript but included in the extant editions.</i>), we will rest and repose thereon (in love) in accordance with the precept of Thy will. (In Thy favor, O Lord our God, grant us repose), and let there be among us no trouble, evil, sorrow nor sighing on the day of our rest"". On the Festivals the formula beginning, ""May our remembrance rise and come"" is added in the third blessing, as also on the first day of the month and on the intermediate days of the festivals."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.6","6. On the Feast of Lights and on the Feast of Lots, there is added in the blessing for the Promised Land the formula beginning, ""For the miracles"" which is inserted on these days in the <i>Amidah</i> prayer. When a festival or the first day of the month falls on a Sabbath, the paragraph beginning, ""Be pleased to fortify us"" is said first, and then that beginning, ""Let arise and come"". So too, when the first day of the month of Tebeth falls on a Sabbath, the paragraph beginning, ""For the miracles"" is added in the blessing for the Promised Land and those respectively commencing, ""Be pleased to fortify us"" and ""let arise and come"" are added in the blessing for the comforting of Israel."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.7","7. In the fourth blessing, the sovereignty of God must be mentioned three times. When there is a guest at table who recites Grace after the meal, he adds a blessing for the host, as follows: ""May it be the Supreme Will that the master of the house shall not suffer shame in this world nor be confounded in the world to come."" The guest may add other blessings to this blessing for the host or expand it."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.8","8. When Grace is said in the home of a mourner, the following is added in the fourth blessing: ""O living King who art kind and dealest kindly, true God and Judge Who judgest righteously and rulest in Thy world, doing therein according to Thy Will, Whose people and servants we are and Whom in all situations we have to thank and bless"". The reciter of Grace then offers up a prayer at his discretion that the mourner shall be vouchsafed comfort, and continues, ""May the All-merciful etc.""."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.9","9. In the home of the newly wedded, the marriage blessing is recited at every meal after the four blessings of the Grace. This blessing is not recited by slaves nor by minors (those under thirteen years of age). For how long a period is it recited? When a widower marries a widow, it is recited on the first day only. When a bachelor marries a widow or a widower marries a spinster, it is recited during the seven days of the festivity (after the marriage)."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.10","10. The blessing which is added to the Grace in the bridegroom's home is the last of the seven marriage benedictions. And this rule applies if those at the meal attended the wedding and heard the blessings. But if there are other guests at the table who had not heard the blessings at the wedding ceremony, the seven blessings are recited for their sake, after Grace, provided however that a quorum of ten adult males is present, including the groom."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.11",The following in brackets is omitted in the manuscript but included in the extant editions:
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.12","[11. The seven benedictions are as follows: Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast formed man. Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast created all things to Thy glory. Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast formed man in Thine image, after Thy likeness, and hast prepared unto him out of his very self a perpetual fabric; blessed art Thou, O Lord, Creator of man. May she who was barren (Zion) be exceedingly glad and exult when her children are gathered within her in joy; blessed art Thou, O Lord, who makest Zion joyful through her children. O make these loved companions greatly to rejoice, even as of old Thou didst gladden Thy creature in the garden of Eden; blessed art Thou, O Lord, who makest bridegroom and bride to rejoice. Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast created joy and gladness, bridegroom and bride, mirth and exultation, pleasure and delight, love, brotherhood, peace and fellowship. Soon may there be heard in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy and gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the jubilant voice of bridegrooms from their canopies and of youths from their feasts of song; blessed art Thou, O Lord, who makest the bridegroom to rejoice with the bride.] If, on Sabbath or Festival, a person forgot to recite in the Grace after meals, the paragraph referring to the special sanctity of the day, and became aware of the omission before he began the fourth blessing, he says, on Sabbath, ""Blessed be the Lord who has given rest to His people Israel, as a sign and holy covenant, blessed art Thou, O Lord, who hallowest the Sabbath""."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.13","12. And on festivals he says, ""Blessed be He who appointed feasts unto His people Israel for joy and gladness, blessed art Thou. O Lord who hallowest Israel and the festivals"". He then begins the fourth blessing and continues to the end. If he only became aware of the omission after he had begun the fourth blessing, he stops and goes back to the beginning of the Grace, namely to the blessing for food."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.14","13. If, on New Moons, one forgot to recite the paragraph beginning, ""Let arise and come"", and became aware of the omission before beginning the fourth blessing, he says, ""Blessed is He who appointed New Moons unto His people Israel as a remembrance"" and does not conclude with any other formula, (Blessed art Thou, O Lord, etc."" as on Sabbaths and Festivals) but begins the fourth blessing and continues to the end. If he became aware of the omission after he had begun the fourth blessing, he continues to the end and does not go back. So too, on the intermediate days of the festivals and on the Feast of Lights and the Feast of Lots, if he forgot and made no reference to the special character of the day he does not go back."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.2.15","14. If one forgot to say Grace after a meal, and became aware of the omission before the meal was digested<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*as long as he is not hungry.</i> he goes back and recites Grace. Once the food has been digested, he does not go back to say Grace. So too, if he has forgotten whether he had said Grace or not, he recites it as long as the meal is not yet digested."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.3.1","1. There are five species of grain;—wheat, barley, spelt, oats and rye. Spelt belongs to the wheat species; oats and rye belong to the barley species. As long as they are in the ear, these five species are everywhere called produce. After having been threshed and winnowed, they are termed grain. When they have been ground and the meal has been kneaded and baked, the product is called bread. The bread made of any of these species is everywhere styled bread without qualification."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.3.2","2. Whoever eats bread has to recite before the meal the blessing, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who bringest forth bread from the earth""; [and after the meal, the four blessings of the Grace after meals.<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**Words in brackets are not in the manuscript but are in the printed text.</i>] If one eats grain, plainly boiled, he recites before the meal the blessing; <sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">***All these blessings have the introductory formula ""Blessed art Thou Lord, our God, King of the Universe"".</i> ""… Who createst the fruit of the earth"", and after it, ""Who createst many living beings with their wants etc."". If one eats meal, he first recites the blessing ""by Whose word all things exist"", and after he has eaten, ""Who createst many living beings""."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.3.3","3. Meal of any one of these five species of grain that had been boiled and then mixed with water or other fluids, if it is so thick that it can be eaten and masticated, requires, before it is eaten, the recital of the blessing, ""Who createst various kinds of foods,"" and after it is eaten, the recital of the blessing, ""For the sustenance and nourishment etc."" If the gruel was so thin that it could only be drunk, the blessing before partaking of it is, ""by Whose word all things exist"", and afterwards that beginning, ""Who createst many living beings""."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.3.4","4. If meal of one of these five species was boiled in a saucepan by itself, or mixed with other ingredients, as in the case of pancakes etc., or if grain was split or crushed and boiled in a saucepan as for example, groats or crushed early grain—all of which are called pot-food,—or if any one of these five species was mixed, either in the form of meal or bread with any cooked food, the blessing to be recited before partaking of it is ""Who createst different species of food."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.3.5","5. This only applies when this species of grain was regarded by the consumer as the chief constituent in the dish and not as an adjunct. But if one of the five species of grain that had been mixed with other ingredients was secondary, the consumer recites the blessing for the chief constituent of the dish and is freed from the obligation of uttering a blessing for the adjunct. For the general rule in the recital of blessings is that where a dish contained both a principal and a secondary constituent, the blessing is recited for the principal constituent, and this recital dispenses one from reciting a blessing for the adjunct, whether the latter was mixed with the former or not."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.3.6","6. What is a mixed adjunct? For example, if turnip or cabbage is cooked, and meal of one of the five species of grain is added in the cooking to thicken the dish, the blessing ""Who created different species of foods"" is not recited, because the turnip or cabbage is the principal constituent while the meal is secondary. For everything added to a dish to give it thickness, fragrance or color, is adjunctory. What however is added to give savour [taste] to the mixture, is regarded as a chief constituent. Accordingly, when various kinds of honey are cooked together with the addition of starch to thicken the mixture in order to make sweetmeats, the blessing ""Who createst different species of food"" is not recited over the products, since the principal constituent is the honey."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.3.7","7. What is an unmixed adjunct? If one needs to eat salt fish and eats bread with it, so that the salt should not injure his throat and tongue, he recites the blessing for the salty dish, and this dispenses him from the obligation of reciting the blessing for the bread, since the bread is an adjunct. The same rule applies to similar cases."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.3.8","8. When bread is broken up and the pieces are cooked in a saucepan or kneaded together with the addition of broth, if there are some pieces of the size of an olive, or if they are recognizable as bread,—their appearance being unchanged, the blessing before eating them is ""Who bringest forth bread from the earth"". But if none of the pieces is of the size of an olive, or if they have completely lost the appearance of bread, the blessing before eating them is ""Who createst different species of food."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.3.9","9. When dough is baked in the earth, as the Arabs who live in the desert bake it, the previous blessing is ""Who createst different kinds of food"", the product riot having the appearance of bread. If one makes a meal of it, the blessing is ""Who bringest forth bread from the earth."" So too when a dough is kneaded with honey, oil or milk, or mixed with different ingredients and then baked—this is termed cake,—the blessing, before eating it, is ""Who createst different kinds of food."" But if one makes a meal of it, the blessing is ""Who bringest forth bread from the earth."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.3.10","10. When rice is cooked or bread is made of it, the blessing said before eating it is ""Who createst various kinds of food"", and afterwards ""Who createst many living beings etc.""—provided however that the food is not mixed with anything else but is only rice. When bread is made of millet or other species of rice, the blessing recited before eating it is ""By Whose word all things exist"", and afterwards ""Who createst many living beings etc."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.3.11","11. Any food for which the blessing ""Who bringest forth bread from the earth"" is first said, requires, after it is eaten, the recital of the full Grace after Meals with its four blessings. Any food for which the blessing ""Who createst different kinds of food"" is first said requires after the meal the Blessing which is an epitome of the first three blessings of the Grace after meals. Rice is an exception to this rule."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.3.12","12. The above rules apply if the food consumed is as much [in size] as an olive, or more. But if the food eaten by an individual is less in volume than an olive—whether it be bread or other food,—or if the quantity drunk by a person is less than the fourth of a <i>Log</i>—whether it be wine or other liquids, he first recites the blessing prescribed for the particular food or drink but says no blessing afterwards."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.3.13","13. The Epitome of the first three blessings of the Grace after meals is as follows: ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, for the sustenance and for the nourishment, and for the desirable, good and ample land which Thou wast pleased to give as an heritage unto our fathers. Have mercy, O Lord our God, (upon us and upon Israel Thy people),<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Omitted in the manuscript.</i> upon Jerusalem Thy city, and upon Zion, the abiding-place of Thy glory. Lead us up thither and make us rejoice in its rebuilding.""<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*""May we eat of its fruits and be satisfied with its goodness"" is in the manuscript but marked to be struck out.</i> And we will bless Thee for it in holiness and purity. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, for the land and for the sustenance."" On Sabbaths and Festivals a reference to the special sanctity of the day is added, as in the Grace after meals."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.4.1","1. The Grace after meals as well as the Single Blessing epitomizing its first three Blessings must be said in the place where the meal was taken. If a person ate, while walking, he should sit down at the spot where he finished his meal and say Grace. If one ate standing, he should sit down in the same place and say Grace. If he forgot to say the Grace after meals, and becomes aware of his omission before the meal is digested, he recites the Grace at the place where he becomes aware of it. If the omission was a wilful neglect, he has to return to the place where the meal was taken and there say Grace. Nevertheless, if the Grace was said in the place where he recalled the omission, he has fulfilled his duty. So too the duty is fulfilled if the Grace is said, standing or walking. But one should not deliberately say Grace or its Epitome otherwise than sitting down and in the place where the meal was taken."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.4.2","2. If one is in doubt as to whether he said the blessing ""Who bringest forth bread etc."" or not, he should not say it again, because this blessing is not prescribed in the Torah. But if one forgot to say this blessing and became aware of the omission before the completion of the meal, he says the blessing. If he only becomes aware of the omission after the meal was completed, he does not say it."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.4.3","3. If a person began his meal in one apartment and interrupted it and went to another apartment or a friend called him while he was eating, wishing to speak to him, and he went to the door of his apartment, and in either of these cases returned to his place, he must, since he had moved from it, first say Grace for what he had eaten, and again repeat the blessing ""Who bringest forth bread"", after which he completes his meal."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.4.4","4. Friends who sat down to have a meal in company, and went out to greet a bridegroom or bride, if they left behind an old man or a sick man, they return to their places and complete their meal without having to say the preliminary blessing a second time. But if they left no one behind, they need, before going out, to say Grace for what they have eaten, and when they return, to say the blessing for the food they are about to eat."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.4.5","5. The same is the rule with persons who form a drinking party or sit down to eat fruit together. Any one who leaves the place is regarded as having finished eating or drinking. He must therefore first say Grace for what he has already consumed and (when he comes back) again say the blessing for what he is about to eat or drink. But a person who changes his seat from one corner of the room to another need not repeat the blessing. If one began a meal on the east side of a fig-tree and then goes to the west side to continue the meal, he must say the preliminary blessing again."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.4.6","6. If one said the blessing for the bread, this dispenses him from saying the blessing for the relish eaten with the bread, whether it be a cooked dish, fruit or similar things. But if he said the blessing for the relish, this does not dispense him from saying the blessing for the bread. If one said the blessing for cooked cereals, this dispenses him from the blessing for the soup, and if he said the blessing for the other cooked dish, this exempts him from saying the blessing for the cooked cereal.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*So in the manuscript. But in the extant printed editions the last sentence reads: But if he said the blessing for the other cooked dish, this does not exempt him from saying the blessing for the cooked cereal.</i>"
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.4.7","7. A person who intended to stop eating or drinking and then changed his mind and resolved to continue his meal, even if he has not moved from his place, has first to repeat the blessing (for what he is about to take). But if he has not made up his mind but intended, on the contrary, to resume the meal, he need not say the blessing a second time, even though the interruption lasted the whole day."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.4.8","8. If a company drinking together said ""Come, let us say Grace"" or ""Come, let us say the Blessing for the Sanctification of the Day"" (i.e. inauguration of the incoming Sabbath or Festival), they are forbidden to continue drinking till they have said Grace or recited the Blessing for the Sanctification of the Day. But if, regardless of the prohibition, they wish to drink before saying Grace or the blessing for the Sanctification of the Day, (though they are forbidden to do so) they must first say the blessing ""Who createst the fruit of the vine"" and then drink. But if they said ""Come let us say the Blessing for the conclusion of Sabbath or Festival,"" they need not, if they continue drinking, first say the blessing ""Who created the fruit of the vine."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.4.9","9. If a company was drinking wine, and another kind of wine was brought them; for instance if they were drinking red wine and black wine was brought, or old wine and new wine was brought, they need not say the blessing for the wine a second time; but they say the blessing ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who is good and doeth good""."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.4.10","10. No blessing for any food or drink is said till it has been placed before the one who says the blessing. If he has already said the blessing and then the food or drink is brought to him, he must say the blessing a second time. If a person took food in his hand and said the blessing, and it dropped out of his hand and was burnt or swept away in the river, he takes another portion of food and says the blessing a second time even though the food be of the same kind. He also needs to recite the sentence ""Blessed be the name of His glorious sovereignty for ever and ever,"" so as to avoid the sin of having uttered God's name in vain. A person, standing by a water-course, says the blessing and drinks, although the draught of water which he drinks is not that which was before him at the moment when he said the blessing, since he had this in mind from the beginning."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.4.11","11. Dishes served in the course of the meal and which are part of the meal need no blessing to be said before or after partaking of them. The blessing for bread at the beginning of the meal and the Grace at the end cover all these which are contributory to the meal. Dishes not part of the meal, but which are served in the course of the meal, require a blessing to be said before they are eaten but none afterwards. Dishes served after the meal is over, whether they belong to the meal or not, require a blessing to be said before they are eaten and a blessing afterwards."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.4.12","12. On Sabbaths and festivals, as also at the meal eaten after blood-letting or after one has had a vapor-bath and on similar occasions, when wine is a principal part of the meal, a blessing recited for wine drunk before the meal exempts one from saying the blessing for wine drunk after the meal and before the recital of Grace. On other days however, he must recite the blessing for wine drunk after the meal. When wine is served during the meal, every one at the table says the blessing for himself; for the throat, engaged in swallowing the food, is not free to respond Amen. This blessing does not exempt the diners from saying the blessing for wine drunk after the meal."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.1","1. Women and slaves are also under the obligation of saying Grace after meals. It is doubtful however whether this obligation is imposed by the Torah, there being no set time for its fulfillment—or whether it is one only imposed by the sages. Hence they cannot, by saying it, discharge male adults from their obligation. Boys (under 13) are under an obligation to say Grace after meals by an ordinance of the sages so that they may be trained in the observance of religious duties."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.2","2. When three persons or more eat bread together, they have to say before the Grace a preliminary benedictory formula. If the company at table consisted of at least three and fewer than ten, one of them says ""We will bless Him of Whose bounty we have eaten"". All the others respond ""Blessed be He of Whose bounty we have eaten and by Whose goodness we live."" He then repeats ""Blessed be He of Whose bounty we have eaten and by Whose goodness we live."" Then he begins ""Blessed art Thou O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who feedest the whole world with His goodness"" and continues to the end of the four Blessings,—the others responding ""Amen"" after each blessing."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.3","3. If the company at table consisted of ten or more, the introductory formula includes the name of God. The one who says Grace begins ""We will bless our God, of Whose bounty we have eaten."" The others respond ""Blessed be our God, of Whose bounty we have eaten, and by Whose goodness we live."" The leader then repeats ""Blessed be our God, of Whose bounty we have eaten, and by Whose goodness we live."" And then he commences the Grace."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.4","4. If one takes a meal at a bridegroom's table—during the period extending from the time that preparations are begun for the requisites of the wedding banquet up to the expiry of thirty days after the marriage—he introduces the Grace thus ""We will bless Him in Whose abode is joy, and of Whose bounty we have eaten."" The others respond ""Blessed be He in Whose abode is joy and of Whose bounty we have eaten."" If there were ten persons present, he says ""We will bless our God in Whose abode is joy, and of Whose bounty we have eaten."" The others respond ""Blessed be our God in Whose abode is joy and of Whose bounty we have eaten."" So too when a banquet is given in honor of the marriage within twelve months of its having taken place, the formula ""in Whose abode is joy"" is used."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.5","5. All are under the obligation of reciting the introductory benedictory formula, just as they are under an obligation to say Grace after meals. This applies also to priests partaking of holiest food in the Courtyard of the Temple. On the same principle also, when priests and ordinary Israelites are eating in company, the former partaking of the heave-offerings, the latter of unconsecrated food, they are all under the obligation of reciting the Introductory Benedictory formula before Grace."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.6","6. Women, slaves and minors are not eligible for the quorum required for the introductory formula. But they recite it when they are by themselves. However, to prevent licentiousness, women, slaves and minors should not be formed into a joint company for Grace. But women may form a quorum for themselves, and so may slaves. In either case they do not use the name of God in the introductory formula. An androgyne recites the introductory formula if the entire company is of his class, but not if the other members are normal men and women. One whose sex cannot be determined never says the introductory formula. A minor if he is only seven or eight years of age, provided he understands Who it is that is addressed in benediction, may be counted in the quorum, whether it consists of three or ten persons. A non-Israelite is not to be counted."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.7","7. That person only may be counted who ate bread at least as much as the size of an olive. If seven of a company ate bread while the other three ate vegetables or partook of juice, etc. they all join for Grace and insert the name of God in the introductory formula, provided that the one who says Grace is of those who ate bread. But if six ate bread while four partook of vegetables, they do not form a quorum of ten, because for such a quorum there must be an easily recognizable majority of those who ate bread. This rule applies to a quorum of ten. But to constitute a quorum of three, each of the party must have eaten bread as much as the size of an olive, and in such a case they recite the introductory formula."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.8","8. If two persons were eating together and after they had concluded their meal, a third person joined them, they may form a quorum, provided that the first two could eat with him, however little it might be, and even if it were different food. The greatest scholar in the company says Grace, even though he arrived last."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.9","9. Where three persons have eaten together, they may not separate for Grace. The same is the rule with four or five. A company of six however (less than ten) may divide for Grace into two groups. When there are ten or more in the company, they may not separate for Grace till they are twenty; for fellow-diners may only separate themselves into groups, when each group is sufficiently large to qualify for the recital of the same introductory formula as would be recited if they continued to be all together."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.10","10. When three men, belonging to three distinct groups at table, each of which consisted of three individuals come together, they may not separate for Grace. But if each of these had already joined in the Introductory formula, they may say Grace separately, and are not under an obligation to form a new group, they having done so once already. When three men take their meals at one table, even though each of them eats of his own bread, they may not separate for Grace, but are to say Grace together as a group with the Introductory formula."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.11","11. If two companies have a meal in the same house and some in each company can see those in the other company, they all form one group for Grace. Should this not be the case, each company says Grace for itself. If they are all served by one waiter who goes from one company to the other, they say Grace together, even if they do not see each other. It is essential however that every word uttered by the one who says Grace should be heard distinctly by both companies."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.12","12. If three persons had their meals in company and one went out into the street, the other two call to him to attend to what they will say. They then count him in the quorum, though he is in the street, and he too discharges his obligation to join in the Grace. When he returns home, he must say Grace for himself. But when ten persons had their meals together and one of them went out into the street, they do not count him in the quorum of ten till he has returned and is seated in his place."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.13","13. If three persons ate together, and one of them anticipated the others and said Grace for himself, the others may still count him in their quorum of three, and have fulfilled their duty, but he has not done so since the obligation of saying Grace in a group cannot be discharged retroactively."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.14","14. If two persons had their meals together, each of them says Grace for himself. If one knew the Grace while the other did not know it, the former recites it aloud and the latter responds ""Amen"" after each blessing and thus fulfills his duty. A son may in this way recite Grace on his father's behalf; a slave for his master; a wife for her husband. But the sages say ""A curse will befall one whose wife or child recites the Grace for him."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.15","15. It is however to be noted that these persons are only discharged of their obligation if they partook of a meal and their hunger is not satisfied. In this case the obligation to say Grace is one imposed by the dicta of the Scribes, and can therefore be fulfilled on their behalf by a minor, slave or woman. But if one has eaten and is satisfied, the duty to say Grace is Scriptural and cannot be discharged on his behalf by a woman, minor or slave, on the principle that anyone who is under an obligation imposed by the Torah can only be discharged of it by one upon whom the Torah imposes the same obligation."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.5.16","16. When a person joins a company at the time when they are beginning the Introductory formula to the Grace, the rule is as follows: If he enters at the moment when the leader who says Grace utters the sentence ""Let us bless etc."", he responds ""Blessed be He and blessed be His name for ever and ever."" Should he enter when the company is responding ""Blessed be He of Whose bounty we have partaken,"" he responds ""Amen""."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.1","1. When one eats that kind of bread, the blessing for which is ""Who bringest forth bread from the earth"", he must wash his hands before and after the meal. Even if it is unconsecrated bread and his hands are free from dirt and he is not aware of any uncleanliness attaching to them, he should not eat till he has washed his hands. Similarly any food that is dipped in liquids requires previous washing of the hands."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.2","2. When washing the hands, whether for a meal or for the recital of the Shema or the <i>Amidah</i> prayer, one first says the blessing ""Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments and given us command concerning the washing of the hands"". For this is an ordinance of the sages whose instructions the Torah bids us heed, as it is said ""According to the law which they shall teach thee' (Deut. 17-11). The washing of the hands after a meal requires no blessing, since it was only instituted as a precautionary measure against danger to health.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*that might arise from touching the eyes with fingers that have salt adhering to them. (See next paragraph.)</i> Special attention should, on this account, be paid to the observance."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.3","3. Washing of the hands between the courses is permissive; a person may wash or refrain from doing so, as he pleases. Fruit that is unconsecrated does not require washing of the hands either before or after being eaten; and anyone who washes his hands for fruit belongs to the class of the arrogant. All bread that has salt in it requires washing of the hands at the end of the meal, for it may contain Salt of Sodom<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**Dead Sea.</i> or salt with similar properties, and a person after eating such bread may pass his hands over his eyes and lose his sight. Hence the obligation to wash the hands at the end of each meal, on account of the salt. Soldiers in camp are dispensed from the duty of washing their hands before meals as their minds are preoccupied. But they are under the obligation of washing their hands after meals as a precaution against risk to health."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.4","4. How far up must the hands be washed? Up to the wrist. How much water should be used? A quarter (of a <i>log</i>) for both hands. Whatever substances are regarded as preventing the water from coming in contact with the body, when bathing in a ritual bath, are also so regarded in washing the hands.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*See Laws of Ritual Baths, Chapter 2.</i> Whatever may serve to make up the measure of water required in a ritual bath<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**E.g., snow.</i> will also serve for the fourth of a <i>log</i> requisite for washing the hands."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.5","5. If a person who has to wash his hands dipped them into the water of a ritual bath,—this is sufficient. But if he dipped them in a quantity of water less than that required for a ritual bath or in water that had been drawn forth from the ritual bath even if it is now in (a hollow of) the ground, his act is ineffective. For water that is drawn forth is only regarded as cleansing the hands, if poured on them."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.6","6. A person washing his hands must have regard to four things: as to the water, that it should not be unfit for washing the hands; as to the quantity, that there should be the fourth of a <i>log</i> for each pair of hands; as to the vessel, that the water used for washing the hands should be in a vessel; and as to the person who washes the hands, that the pouring of the water should result directly from the exercise of human effort."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.7","7. Four circumstances render water unfit for washing the hands,—change in color, exposure, previous use, and deterioration to an extent that would prevent cattle drinking of it. If water has changed in color, whether it is contained in a vessel or kept in the ground and whether the change was caused by a substance dropped into the water, or is due to its situation, it is unfit for washing the hands. So also, if it has been subjected to such an exposure as would prohibit its being used for drinking, it is unfit for washing the hands."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.8","8. Water used in work becomes waste and is unfit for washing the hands. For example, water in which one washed utensils or dipped his bread, etc., whether the water is in vessels or in the ground is unfit for washing the hands. But if one rinses in it utensils that have been washed or that are new, he does not render it unfit. The water in which the baker dips the loaves is unfit for washing the hands; but that from which he fills his hands while kneading is fit, because only the water in his hands is regarded as having been used, but not the water left in the vessel from which he filled his hands."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.9","9. Any water, unfit for a dog to drink, e.g. water that is so bitter, salty, muddy or malodorous that a dog will not drink it, is unfit for washing the hands, if contained in vessels. As long as it is in the ground, it is fit for ritual bathing. While the hot waters of Tiberias are in their natural situation, the hands may be immersed in them. But if one has drawn off some of it in a vessel, or diverted it by a channel to another situation, it may not be used for washing the hands before or after a meal because it is unfit for an animal to drink."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.10","10. A person washing his hands should pour the water on his hands little by little, till the prescribed quantity has been used. If the entire quarter of a <i>log</i> has been poured forth at once, this too is a correct lavation. Four or five persons may wash at the same time, their hands being adjacent or above each other, provided that the hands are kept loose, so that the water can pass between, and provided also that the quantity of water used amounts to a quarter of a <i>log</i> for each person."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.11","11. The hands are not to be washed with water contained either in the sides of broken vessels or in the bottom of a cask, or in potsherds, or in the spigot of a cask. If however the spigot was specially fashioned for washing the hands, it may be so used. So too a skin bottle that has been adapted for the purpose (hollowed out to contain the requisite quantity), may be used for washing the hands. A sack or basket even if specially adapted may not be used for washing the hands, because they cannot hold the water."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.12","One should not hand water in one's palm to another person for washing the hands, for one's palms are not a vessel. Vessels broken to an extent that would free them of ritual defilement are not to be used for washing the hands, since they are fragments."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.13","12. All kinds of vessels may be used for washing the hands, even those made of dung or of earth, provided that they are whole. A vessel which does not hold a quarter of a <i>log</i> or which at the time does not actually contain that quantity of water is not to be used for washing the hands."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.14","13. Anyone, even a deaf-mute, idiot or minor, is qualified to pour water on a person's hands for ritual washing. If no one else is present, the person washing his hands places the vessel between his knees and so causes the water to flow upon the hands or tilts the cask above his hands and so washes them, or holding the vessel in each hand alternately, washes the other. An ape may be employed for pouring the water."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.15","14. In the case of a trough, filled by hand or by means of a wheel, from which the water passes into a trench to irrigate growing vegetables or to water cattle; if a person puts his hands in the trough and the water passes over them and rinses them, this does not constitute a ritual washing of the hands. But if they were held close to the place where the bucket empties the water into the trough, so that the waters flow over the hands as the direct effect of the action of the man who poured the water into the trough, it is accounted a ritual washing."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.16","15. When one is in doubt whether the water he used in washing his hands had been previously used or not, whether it had been of the prescribed quantity or not, whether it was ritually clean or not, or is in doubt whether he had washed his hands or not, the decision is that he is ritually clean, because any doubt that arises as to the ritual cleanliness of the hands is resolved in a favorable sense."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.17","16. In washing before a meal, the hands should be raised, so that the water, after reaching the wrist, may not flow back and render the hands unclean. In washing after a meal, the hands should be lowered so that every trace of salt should be removed from them. The washing of the hands before a meal may take place above (into) a vessel or on the ground. But after a meal the washing must be above (into) a vessel. The water used for washing before a meal may be made hot by fire, or be cold. But for washing after a meal, hot water may not be taken, that is, water sufficiently hot to scald the hands; for in such a case the grubbiness of the hands would not be removed since in water of that temperature, the hands cannot be rubbed. If however the water was tepid, it may be used for washing the hands after a meal."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.18","17. A person may wash his hands in the morning and make a condition with himself that this shall be the ablution for the entire day, and then he need not wash his hands for each meal—provided however that he does not allow his mind to become at any time oblivious of the intent to keep his hands clean. Should he have become oblivious, he has to wash his hands each time when this would ordinarily be required."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.19","18. A person may wrap his hands in a napkin and eat bread or other food that is dipped in a liquid, even if he had not washed his hands. An individual, feeding another individual, need not wash his hands. But the one fed has to wash his hands, even if another individual puts the food into his mouth while he does not touch it. Likewise a person who uses a fork has to wash his hands."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.20","19. It is forbidden to feed any one who has not washed his hands, even if the food is put into the person's mouth. It is forbidden to treat the rite of washing the hands as a matter of slight importance. The sages have many ordinances and exhortations on this subject. Even if a person has only enough water for drinking, he should use part of it to wash his hands, take his meal, and drink the rest of the water."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.6.21","20. The hands are to be dried first and then the meal is to be begun. To eat without having dried one's hands is the same as partaking of bread that is unclean. Anyone who washes his hands after a meal dries them and then says Grace. Immediately after washing the hands, Grace should follow without interruption. After having washed the hands at the close of a meal, it is forbidden even to drink water till Grace has been recited."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.1","1. The Sages of Israel observed many customs at meals—all of them, rules of good manners. They are as follows: When the meal is to be taken, the senior in the company washes his hands first; then they enter the room and take their seats and sit in a reclining posture. The senior reclines at the head of the room, the next most distinguished below him. If there are three couches, the most distinguished occupies one at the head of the room, the person next in degree occupies the couch above this; the person third in rank below it.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*And thus the most distinguished is seated between the two other persons.</i>"
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.2","2. The host recites the blessing ""Who bringest forth bread from the earth,"" concludes it and cuts the bread. A guest recites Grace after meals so that he may pronounce a benediction on the host. If there is no host, the senior in the company cuts the bread and also says Grace after meals."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.3","3. The one who cuts the bread may not do so till salt or a relish has been placed before every one at the table—unless they propose to eat dry bread. He is not to cut a small size because this would make him seem parsimonious, nor a slice larger than the size of an egg for then he would seem ravenous. On Sabbath a large slice is cut. The bread is to be cut only at the part where it has been thoroughly baked."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.4","4. The most preferable way is to cut a whole loaf. If there is a whole loaf of barley bread and there is also a cut loaf of wheaten bread, the host puts the whole loaf within the cut loaf and divides them both, so that he cuts the wheaten bread and at the same time the whole loaf. On Sabbaths and Festivals, it is obligatory to say the blessing over two loaves. The host takes both loaves in his hand and cuts one of them."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.5","5. The individual who cuts the loaf places a slice before everyone at table; and a slice he takes in his hand. He does not put the bread into the hand of anyone except that of a mourner. The person who cuts the bread helps himself first and begins to eat. Those at the table may not taste of any dish till the person who has said the blessing over the bread, has tasted first. He may not however begin to eat till the sound of the ""Amen"" uttered by the majority of those present has ceased. If he desires to show courtesy to his teacher or to his superior in learning by permitting him to help himself first, he is at liberty to do so."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.6","6. Two having a meal together, in partaking of the successive dishes, wait for each other; but three do not need to do so. If two of them have completed their meal, the third pauses for grace. If one has finished, the other two do not pause, but continue their meal, till they have completed it. No conversation takes place during a meal, to avoid the risk (of choking). Hence, when wine is served in the course of the meal, every one at table says the blessing for himself; for if one were to say the blessing, and another responded ""Amen"" while swallowing, he might be in danger of choking. Nor may one stare at a person while he is eating, or at his portion of food, so as not to embarrass him."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.7","7. The waiter who serves those at table does not join them in the meal. But it is kindly to put into his mouth a morsel of every dish so as to quiet his mind. If wine is offered him, he says the blessing for each cup separately, for his drinking does not depend on his volition but on the good will of those at table."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.8","8. If one of the diners left the room, to relieve himself, he washes one hand and re-enters. If he was engaged in conversation, and was away a considerable time, he washes both hands before rejoining his companions. If they formed a drinking party, he enters the room, resumes his seat, washes his hands and then turns his face to the guests. Why does he wash his hands when he is in his place? Lest they say that, as no food is being consumed, he has not washed his hands."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.9","9. Raw meat is not to be put on bread. A full cup of wine is not to be passed over bread. A dish should not be supported with a slice (or loaf) of bread. Bread must not be thrown. Nor should this be done with pieces of food, or with food that is without a shell, such as mulberries, grapes, figs, because they are thus rendered nauseous. Wine may be drawn through pipes in houses where wedding festivities are taking place. Parched corn and nuts may be flung in front of a bridal couple, but only in summer and not in winter, for then they would become nauseous. The hands may not be washed in wine, whether it be pure or diluted. So too no kind of food or drink may be spoilt by being handled contemptuously or roughly."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.10","10. Guests may not take of the food put before them and give it to the host's son or daughter For the host would be ashamed if it was to be that which he had put before his guests and it turned out that the children had taken it. One may not send to his friend a cask of wine with oil floating on its surface. For the latter may have received another cask containing wine only; and under the impression that the former cask contains oil, will invite guests to a meal and be put to shame. Similarly any procedure of a like character which might bring shame to a host is forbidden."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.11","11. After the guests have ended the meal, the table is removed, the floor is swept at the place where they have eaten, after which they wash their hands. For there might have been crumbs on the floor, the size of an olive, on which one may not step and over which one may not wash. Crumbs less than the size of an olive may be destroyed with the hands."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.12","12. When water has been brought for washing the hands, the person who is to say Grace after meals washes first, so that he, the senior, shall not sit with unclean hands till another has washed. His companions at tables then wash their hands, one after another, without regard to order of precedence. This courtesy is not observed in washing the hands, nor in crossing bridges nor when walking on roads but only when passing through a door which requires a <i>Mezuzah,</i> and then only when entering."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.13","13. After the washing and drying of the hands has been completed and Grace said and the fumigator of sweet spices brought in, the person who said Grace recites the blessing for the fumigatory compound, and the others present respond ""Amen""."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.14","14. If there is wine, a cup holding a quarter [of a <i>log</i>] or more, is brought together with spices. The person who is to say Grace takes the wine in his right hand and the spices in his left, and recites Grace after meals, then says the blessing for the wine and lastly the blessing for the spices. If the spices are in the form of a fragrant oil or something similar, he smears the head of the waiter with it. Should the latter be a scholar, he daubs it on the wall, so that the latter should not go out into the street smelling of perfume."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.7.15","15. Although wine is not indispensable for Grace after meals, still if it is said with wine, according to the custom mentioned, it is necessary that the cup used for Grace should first be washed within and rinsed without, and then filled with pure wine. When the second blessing—that for the holy land is reached, a little water is poured into the cup so that the contents may be pleasant to drink. After the Cup for Grace is on the table, there must be no conversation. But all remain silent till the Grace after meals and the blessing for the wine have been said, and then they drink."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.1","1. Before partaking of fruits of trees, the blessing is said, ""Who createst the fruit of the tree;"" and after these are consumed, ""Who createst many living beings and their wants."" The five species of fruit mentioned in the Torah, namely, grapes, pomegranates, figs, olives and dates form an exception. After partaking of any of these, the blessing said is the single blessing which is a summary of the first three blessings of the Grace after meals. For fruit that grows on the ground as also for green vegetables, the blessing before they are eaten is ""Who createst the fruit of the earth"", and the subsequent blessing is ""Who createst many living beings etc."". For food that does not belong to the vegetable kingdom such as flesh, cheese, fish, eggs, water, milk, honey and similar things, the blessing before partaking of any of them is ""By Whose word all things exist""; and the subsequent blessing is ""Who createst many living beings etc."". A person drinking water, but not to quench his thirst, does not require to say a blessing before or after."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.2","2. If a person squeezes fruit and extracts its juice he says the blessing before he drinks it, ""By Whose word, all things exist,"" and afterwards, the blessing ""Who createst many living beings""…. Grapes and olives form an exception to this rule. The blessing before drinking wine is ""Who createst the fruit of the vine""; and afterwards the blessing which is a summary of the first three blessings of the Grace after meals. The blessing before drinking olive oil is ""Who createst the fruit of the tree."" Such is the rule only if a person suffers from sore throat and drinks oil mixed with thin gruel, and similar things. For he receives specific benefit from drinking it. But if he drinks the oil by itself or is not suffering from a sore throat, he says the blessing ""By Whose word all things exist,"" since he derived no specific benefit from the taste of the oil."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.3","3. For fruits or vegetables, usually eaten raw, if they have been boiled or scalded, the blessing before they are consumed is ""By Whose word, all things exist,"" and after they have been eaten, ""Who createst many living beings."" … For vegetables like cabbages and turnips that are usually eaten cooked, the blessing first said if they are eaten raw, is ""By Whose word all things exist"", and the blessing said, after they are consumed, is ""Who createst many livng beings."" … When they are boiled, or steeped in hot water, the blessing before eating them is ""Who createst the fruit of the earth,"" and the blessing after is ""Who createst many living beings."" … For foods eaten either raw or cooked, the blessing appropriate to them is said before partaking of them in either state. If it is fruit that grows on a tree, the blessing is ""Who createst the fruit of the tree""; if fruit that grows on the ground, ""Who createst the fruit of the earth."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.4","4. Where vegetables customarily steeped in boiling water, have been so treated, the blessing before drinking the liquid is ""Who createst the fruit of the earth; provided that when steeping the vegetable there was an intent that the liquid should be drunk. For where it is customary to drink the liquid it is like the steeped food. The blessing before partaking of date honey is ""By Whose word all things exist."" But for dates crushed by hand, the stones removed, and fashioned into a dough-like mass, the preliminary blessing is ""Who createst the fruit of the tree"" and the blessing, after eating of it, is the summary of the first three blessings of the Grace after meals."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.5","5. The juice pressed out of the sweet canes and boiled till it coagulates and crystallizes like salt, requires, according to all the <i>Geonim,</i> the blessing ""Who createst the fruit of the earth."" Some hold that the blessing is ""Who createst the fruit of the tree."" I hold that this is not a fruit, and the only blessing to be said is ""By Whose word all things exist,"" since the honey (sugar) extracted from these canes and changed by fire is not of more consequence than date honey which has undergone no such transformation by fire and for which the blessing is ""By Whose word all things exist."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.6","6. For the palm stalk, that is, the top growth of the palm tree which looks like white wood, the preliminary blessing is ""By Whose word all things exist."" For the caperflower-buds, the blessing is ""Who createst the fruit of the earth,"" because it is not fruit. For caper berries, i.e. its fruit, which have the appearance of small thin dates, the blessing is ""Who createst the fruit of the tree."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.7","7. For pepper and ginger in their fresh state, the blessing is ""Who createst the fruit of the earth."" When dry, they require no blessing either before or after they are eaten, as they are spice and not food. Thus also, provisions not suitable for food and fluids not fit for drink require no blessing before or after they are consumed."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.8","8. As to bread that has turned mouldy, wine that has become filmy, a cooked dish that has lost its characteristic appearance, windfall fruit that has lost its taste, beet, vinegar, locusts, salt, mushrooms,—for any of these, the blessing is ""By Whose word all things exist."" Whenever this blessing is recited before partaking of food, the blessing ""Who createst many living beings and their wants"" … is said afterwards. And whatever requires a blessing afterward, requires a preliminary blessing."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.9","9. When three measures of water were poured on lees of wine and four measures of fluid were drawn off, the blessing for drinking it is ""Who createst the fruit of the vine-tree""—it being regarded as diluted wine. But if less than four measures were drawn off, the blessing before partaking of it is ""By Whose word everything exists."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.10","10. If, before partaking of fruit that grows on a tree, a person said the blessing ""Who createst the fruits of the earth,"" he has fulfilled his duty. If, for fruit that grows on the ground, a person said the blessing, ""Who createst the fruit of the tree,"" he has not fulfilled his duty. If, before partaking of any food, including even bread or wine, a person said ""By Whose word everything exists"", he has fulfilled his duty."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.11","11. If a person took a cup of strong drink<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*that is not wine.</i> in his hand and began the blessing with the intent to say ""By Whose word all things exist"", but by mistake said ""Who createst the fruit of the vine"", he is not required to repeat the correct blessing. So, too, if one had fruit growing on the ground before him, and began the blessing with the intent to say ""Who createst the fruit of the earth"", but by mistake said ""Who createst the fruit of the tree"", he is not required to repeat the correct blessing. So too, if a person has before him a dish of cereal and began the blessing intending to say ""Who createst different kinds of food"" and by mistake said ""Who bringest forth bread from the earth"" he has fulfilled his duty; because when he uttered the name of God and declared His sovereignty he had no other intent than to say the blessing appropriate to the particular kind of food before him; and since there was no error in the essential portion of the blessing, he fulfilled his duty, notwithstanding that he made a mistake in its conclusion, and is not required to repeat the correct blessing."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.12","12. In regard to all these blessings, if one is in doubt whether he has said any of them or not, he does not repeat them, irrespective of whether it is recited before or after [partaking of food], since these blessings have all been ordained by the Scribes. Should one have forgotten and put food into his mouth without having previously said the blessing, he swallows it if it is a liquid and then says the blessing. Should it be fruit like mulberries or grapes, which, removed from the mouth, would be unpleasant to eat, he moves it to one side of the mouth, says the blessing and then swallows it. If the food is such that it would not become nauseous if removed from the mouth, e.g. beans and pulse, he removes it, says the blessing with his mouth free and then eats it."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.13","13. When one has several kinds of food before him, and the blessing is the same for each of them, he says the blessing before partaking of one kind, this exempting him from repeating the blessing for the others. If however the blessings vary, he says the blessing appropriate to each kind, and may begin the meal with whichever dish he pleases. If he has no preference and there is on the table any one of the seven fruits indigenous to the Holy Land, he says the blessing over it first. Among these seven, that first mentioned in the Biblical verse is to be preferred. The seven fruits are those named in the text: ""A land of wheat, barley, vine, fig, pomegranate, a land of olive oil and honey"" (Deut. 8:8). The honey here referred to, is the honey of dates. Dates have the preference over grapes, because dates are mentioned in the text second after the word ""land"" (in the second part of the verse), while grapes come third after that word (in the first half of the verse)."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.14","14. The blessing summarizing the first three blessings of the Grace after Meals and which is recited after partaking of any of the five species of fruit (mentioned in the previous paragraph), or after drinking wine, is that said after eating cereal dishes made of any of the five species of grain. With this difference, that after partaking of the fruits the opening formula is ""for the tree and the fruit of the tree, for the produce of the field, for the desirable good and ample land etc.;"" while after drinking wine, one says ""for the vine and the fruit of the vine; the concluding phrase in both cases being ""for the land and its fruits."" Some add to this summary before its conclusion a sentence as follows ""for Thou art a God who is good and beneficent"" as the gist of the fourth blessing of the Grace. Others hold that the fourth blessing was ordained exclusively as a part of the full Grace after Meals."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.15","15. If a person has at one meal, drunk wine, eaten dates, and consumed cereals made of any of the five species of grain, he says as follows: ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, for the sustenance and the nourishment, for the vine and the fruit of the vine, for the tree and the fruit of the tree, for the produce of the field, for the desirable land etc."", and concludes ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord, for the land, for the sustenance and for the fruits""."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.8.16","16. But if one ate meat and drank wine, he says a separate subsequent blessing for each. If one ate figs, grapes, apples, pears and similar things, he says afterwards the Summary of the Grace, the formula of which covers them all since they are all fruits of trees. The same principle applies to similar cases."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.9.1","1. Just as a person is forbidden to partake of food or drink without first saying a blessing, so it is forbidden to enjoy a fragrant odor without a previous blessing. What blessing is said for a fragrant odor? If the odoriferous substance was wood or something that comes from wood,<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*e.g. bark of a tree.</i> the blessing is ""Who createst fragrant trees."" If it was a herb, or something that comes from a herb, the blessing is ""Who createst fragrant herbs"". If it was neither wood nor a herb, as for instance musk which comes from a wild beast, the blessing is ""Who createst diverse kinds of spices."" If it was an edible fruit, such as a citron or an apple, the blessing is ""Who givest a goodly scent to fruits."" If for any of these things, one said ""Who createst diverse kinds of spices,"" he has fulfilled his duty."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.9.2","2. The blessing for incense is not recited till its smoke ascends. What blessing is said for it? If the substance which is burnt and gives forth an odor is of wood, the blessing is ""Who createst fragrant trees."" If it is a herb,—""Who createst fragrant herbs."" If it is an animal substance or something similar, the blessing said is ""Who createst diverse kinds of spices."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.9.3","3. For balsam oil and similar substances, the blessing is ""Who createst sweet-smelling oil."" But for oil of olives pressed or ground with fragrant species of wood till it emits a fragrant odor, the blessing is ""Who createst spicy plants."" For oil made fragrant with sweet-smelling essences like the oil of anointment, the blessing is ""Who createst diverse kinds of spices."" When oil and a branch of myrtle are brought at the same time, the blessing is said for the myrtle, and this exempts one from the obligation of saying a blessing for the oil,—the same blessing being said for both, namely, ""Who createst fragrant plants."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.9.4","4. If one has a perfume derived from a tree and one that is herbaceous, a blessing said for one does not discharge the obligation of saying a blessing for the other; a blessing must be said for each separately. If wine and fragrant oil are brought to a person at the same time, he takes the wine in the right hand and the oil in the left, says the blessing for the wine and drinks it, and then the blessing for the oil and smells it, and dabs the head of the waiter with it.""<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*so that his own hand shall not smell of scent.</i> If the waiter is a scholar, he dabs it on the wall."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.9.5","5. When it is doubtful whether a fragrant substance is derived from a tree or herb, the blessing is ""Who createst diverse kinds of spices."" For a perfume compounded by a druggist and consisting of several spices, the blessing is ""Who createst diverse kinds of spices."" When one enters a perfumery store which contains many varieties of sweet scents, he says the blessing ""Who createst diverse kinds of spices."" Should he stay there the whole day, he says the blessing once only. If he goes in and out he says it each time that he enters."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.9.6","6. For the rose and spikenard, the blessing is ""Who createst fragrant plants."" For lilies of the garden the blessing is ""Who createst fragrant plants;"" for lilies of the field, ""Who createst odorous herbs."" For the rhododendron, rose water, frankincense, mastic, or similar substances, the blessing is ""Who createst fragrant plants."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.9.7","7. There are three classes of perfumes for which no blessing is said: a perfume which it is forbidden to smell, a perfume, the purpose of which is to remove a foul odor, and a perfume that had not been manufactured for the purpose of being smelt."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.9.8","8. Examples: For perfumes used in idolatry, or by women within the prohibited degrees, no blessing is said, since the fragrance may not be inhaled. For perfumes placed near the remains of the dead, or in a lavatory, or oils used to remove unpleasant exhalations from the body, no blessing is said, as their purpose is to remove a foul odor. No blessing is said for a fumigating material used to fumigate vessels or apparel, for it is not used for the purpose of itself being smelt. So too, one who smells garments that have been fumigated says no blessing, as they contain no odorous substance but only an odor without substance."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.9.9","9. No blessing is said for perfumes in a company of idolaters as the presumptive purpose of such an assemblage is idolatrous worship. A person walking outside a city, smells a fragrant odor. If the majority of the inhabitants of that city are idolaters, he does not say a blessing; if the majority are Israelites, he says a blessing. If a perfume for which a blessing should be said is mingled with one for which it is not said, the predominant odor decides as to whether it should or should not be said."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.1","1. Other blessings and many other utterances without [the formal] introduction or conclusion have been ordained by the sages by way of praise and thanks, offered to the Holy God, blessed be He, in the same way as they ordained the blessings in the liturgy previously set forth. These are as follows: When a person has erected a new house or bought new things, whether he already possesses similar things or not, he says ""Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast kept us in life and hast preserved us and enabled us to reach this season."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.2","2. The same blessing is said when one sees an associate after thirty days. If however twelve months have elapsed since he was last seen, one says ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who quickenest the dead."" The first time in the season that one sees<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*according to the Ashkenazi practice, when eating it for the first time in the season.</i> a fruit that is renewed every year, the blessing is said ""Who hast kept us in life, etc."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.3","3. On hearing good news, one says, ""Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who art good, and doest good."" On hearing evil tidings, one says, ""Blessed be the true judge."" A person has to bless God with good will, for ill fortune, just as he has to bless Him with joy for good fortune, as it is said ""And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul and with all thy might."" (Deuteronomy 6:5). In the abounding love of God enjoined upon us, it is implied that even in distress, one should thank and praise Him with joy."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.4","4. When one has experienced good fortune or heard good news, even if the indications are that the good fortune will be followed by evil consequences, he says the blessing ""Who art good and doest good."" So too, if one suffers a misfortune or has heard evil tidings, even if the circumstances indicate that the results will be advantageous, he says ""Blessed be the true Judge""; since the blessings we say have reference not to future events, but to what has just happened."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.5","5. When heavy rains fall, the owner of a field repeats the blessing ""Who hast preserved us in life."" If one is part owner with others, he recites the blessing ""Who art good and doest good."" One who does not own a field says ""We thank Thee, O Lord, our God, for every drop which Thou hast caused to fall for us. And even if our mouths were full of song as the sea,<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**See the <i>Nishmath</i> introductory to Morning Service on Sabbaths and Festivals.</i> and our tongues of exultations as the multitude of its waves, and our lips of praise as the wide extended firmament; and though our eyes shone with light like the sun and the moon, and our hands were spread forth like the eagles of heaven, and our feet were swift as hinds, we should be unable to thank Thee, O Lord our God, and to bless Thy name, O our King, for one minute portion of the billions and trillions of bounties that Thou hast bestowed upon us and upon our fathers in former times. From Egypt Thou hast redeemed us, O Lord our God; from the house of bondage, Thou hast delivered us. During famine Thou hast fed us and didst sustain us in plenty; from the sword Thou didst save us, and from pestilence Thou didst cause us to escape, and from sore and lasting diseases Thou didst draw us forth, O our King. Up till now, Thy tender mercies have helped us, and Thy loving-kindnesses have not forsaken us. Therefore the limbs which Thou hast spread forth in us, and the spirit and soul which Thou hast breathed into our nostrils and the tongue which Thou hast placed in our mouths, 10, they shall thank and bless Thy name, O Lord our God, Blessed art Thou, O Lord, to Whom is due abounding thanksgiving, God ever to be praised."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.6","6. When is the blessing for rain said? From the time when the water swells upon the ground and the continuing rain causes bubbles to form on the surface of the water, and these join together."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.7","7. A person is told that his father died and he is heir. If he has brothers, he first says the blessing which concludes with the phrase ""Judge of Truth"", and then the blessing, the formula of which is ""Who is good and doeth good."" If he has no brothers, he says the blessing ""Who hast preserved us in life etc."" In short, one who shares a benefit with others, says the blessing ""Who is good and doeth good."" When he is the sole beneficiary, he recites the blessing ""Who hast preserved us in life."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.8","8. Four categories of individuals are required to offer thanksgiving: A person who had been sick and has recovered, a prisoner who has been released from prison, voyagers when they have landed, and travellers in the desert when they reach settled territory. The thanksgiving is to be offered in the presence of ten persons, of whom two, at least, must be scholars; as it is said ""Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people and praise Him in the seat of the elders"" (Ps. 107:32). How is this thanksgiving offered, and what is the form of the blessing? The individual (who has occasion for gratitude) rises in the assembly and says the following blessing: ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who vouchsafest benefits unto the undeserving, who hast also vouchsafed good unto me. All the hearers present say: ""He who hath vouchsafed good unto thee, may He vouchsafe good unto thee forever."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.9","9. On seeing a place where miracles had been wrought for Israel, such as the Red Sea or the fords of the Jordan, which the Israelites crossed with Joshua, one says ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who wroughtest miracles for our fathers in this place."" This blessing is also said in any place where miracles had been vouchsafed to a multitude. But where a miracle had been vouchsafed to an individual, he, his son, and his grandson,<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*his remotest descendant.</i> also say the blessing ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who wroughtest miracles for me in this place"" or ""Who wroughtest miracles for my fathers in this place."" When viewing the lion's den (into which Daniel was cast) or the fiery furnace (into which Chananiah, Mishael and Azariah were thrust), the blessing is recited ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who wroughtest miracles for the righteous at this place."" When seeing a place where idols are worshipped, the blessing is said, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe,<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*This introductory formula is put in the Hebrew manuscript in abbreviated form—only the first letters of each word being given. The equivalent in English would be B for blessed, T for art Thou, L for O Lord, etc.</i> who hast been long suffering with those who transgress Thy will."" When seeing a place from which idolatry has been eradicated, if it is in the Holy Land, the blessing is said ""Who hast uprooted idolatry from our land""; if it is outside Palestine, ""Who hast uprooted idolatry from this place."" To both blessings, the petition is added ""Even as Thou hast uprooted idolatry from this place, so do Thou uproot it from all places and turn the heart of idol worshippers to serve Thee."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.10","10. If one sees fine houses of Israelites (that are inhabited),<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**According to Alfasi, <i>Synagogues in the Holy Land.</i></i> he says, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe who settest up the border stone of the widow."" If they are in ruins, he says, ""Blessed be the true judge."" On seeing the graves of Israelites, one says, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who formed you in judgment, and quickened you in judgment, sustained you in judgment and nourished you in judgment and will hereafter raise you up in judgment, to life in the world to come, Blessed art Thou O Lord, who quickenest the dead."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.11","11. If one sees at one time six hundred thousand persons, who are heathens, he says ""Your mother shall be sore ashamed, she that bore you shall be confounded; behold, the latter end of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land and a desert."" (Jerem. 50:12) Should they be Israelites, and he sees them in the land of Israel, he says, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, wise in secrets."" When seeing a gentile sage, one says, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe Who hast imparted of Thy wisdom to flesh and blood."" If the sage is an Israelite, he says ""Who hast imparted of Thy wisdom unto them that fear Thee."" When seeing Israelite kings, one says ""Who hast given of Thy glory and might to them that fear Thee."" If they are gentile kings, he says ""Who hast given of Thy glory to flesh and blood."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.12","12. On seeing a negro, or anyone unusual in facial appearance or conformation of his limbs, one says, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who variest the forms of creatures."" On seeing a blind person, a cripple, or one afflicted with boils or tetters, etc. the blessing said is ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, the true Judge."" If the affliction is congenital, the blessing is ""Who variest the forms of creatures."" On seeing an elephant, an ape or an owl one says, ""Blessed be He Who varieth the forms of creatures."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.13","13. On seeing creatures that are beautiful or exceptionally well formed or goodly trees, one says ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe Who hast such as these in the world."" If one goes out into the fields or gardens during Nisan (i.e. in the Spring) and sees the trees in bud and the flowers in bloom, he says, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast made Thy world lacking in nought, and hast produced therein goodly creatures and good and beautiful trees wherewith to delight the children of men""."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.14","14. For fierce gales, lightning, thunder, terrestrial rumblings that sound like the grinding of huge mills, or for an atmospheric light that has the appearance of shooting stars, swiftly moving from place to place, or of comets;—<i>the witness</i> of any of these phenomena says the blessing. ""Blessed art Thou O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Whose strength and might fill the world"", or ""Who hast made the Creation""."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.15","15. For mountains and hills, seas, deserts or rivers, if one sees any of these at intervals of thirty days, he says the blessing ""Who hast made the Creation."" On seeing the Ocean at intervals of thirty days or more, one says ""Who hast made the Great Sea."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.16","16. At sight of a rainbow, one says the blessing ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who rememberest the Covenant, art faithful to Thy Covenant and keepest Thy promise."" At sight of the new moon, one says, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, by Whose word the heavens were created, and by the breath of Whose mouth all their hosts. A statute and season Thou didst assign unto them, that they should not change their appointed charge. They are glad and rejoice to do the will of their Master—faithful workers whose work is faithful. And the moon He bade renew herself as a crown of glory unto those that have been upborne by Him from the womb, who, in the time to come, will themselves be renewed like her, to honor their Creator for His glorious sovereignty's sake and for all that He has created. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who renewest the months."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.17","17. This blessing is said standing; For everyone who says the blessing for the new moon at the appointed time is regarded as if he had received the Divine Presence. If one has not said the blessing the first night, (of the new moon) he may do so up to the sixteenth of the month, when it is full moon."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.18","18. When one sees the Sun at the vernal equinox, at the beginning of the twenty-eight years' cycle, in the morning of the fourth day of the week, the exact time of the equinox being at the beginning of the evening of the fourth day of the week, he says the blessing, ""Blessed art Thou … Who hast made the Creation."" So also, when the moon enters the zodiacal constellation of <i>Aries</i> (the Ram) at the beginning of the month and does not deflect its course, neither to the north nor to the south; so too when any of the remaining five planets (Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, Mercury) enters the constellation of Aries (the Ram) at the beginning of the month and does not deflect its course either to the north or the south; or when one sees the constellation of the Ram rise from the extreme East of the horizon, he says ""Blessed art Thou … Who hast made the Creation."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.19","19. At the sight of houses of idolators in good condition,<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*That are inhabited.</i> one says, ""The Lord will pluck up the house of the proud."" (Prov. 15:25) If these are in ruins, he says, ""O God of Vengeance, Lord, O God of vengeance, shine forth"" (Ps. 94:1). On seeing graves of idolaters, one says, ""Your mother shall be ashamed etc."" (Jerem. 50:12)"
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.20","20. When about to enter a bath house, one says, ""May it be Thy will, O Lord, My God, to cause me to enter in peace and come forth in peace and deliver me from peril in the present and also in the future. Before the operation of blood letting, the patient says ""May it be Thy will, O Lord, my God, that this may conduce to my health, for Thou healest of Thy free grace."" After the treatment is over, he says ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who healest the sick."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.21","21. When one proceeds to measure grain on his threshing-floor, he says ""May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, to send a blessing on the work of my hands."" After he has begun to measure, he says ""Blessed be He Who sendeth a blessing on this quantity of grain. If he first measures and then offers up a petition,—this is a vain prayer; and generally supplication with reference to what is past is a vain prayer."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.22","22. On entering the house of study, one says ""May it by Thy will, O Lord my God, that I may not err in a matter of <i>Halacha</i> (<i>law</i>), that I may not say of that which is clean that it is unclean, or of that which is unclean that it is clean; or of that which is permitted that it is forbidden, or of that which is forbidden that it is permitted; so that, not erring in a Halachie matter, my colleagues may rejoice with me; and that my colleagues may not err so that I may rejoice with them."" On leaving the house of study, one says ""I render thanks unto Thee, O Lord my God for that Thou hast appointed my portion with those who abide in the house of study and hast not appointed my portion with those who tarry at the street corners; for I rise up early and they rise up early. I rise up early to study the words of the Torah, and they rise up early to engage in vain things, I labour and they labour. I labour in the words of the Torah and receive a reward. They labour and have no reward. I hasten and they hasten. I hasten to life in the world to come and they hasten to the pit of destruction."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.23","23. On entering a city, one says, ""May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, to cause me to enter this city in peace."" Having entered it safely, he says, ""I thank Thee, O Lord my God, that Thou hast caused me to enter in peace."" When about to leave, he says, ""May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, to cause me to go forth from this city in peace."" Having left safely, he says, ""I thank Thee, O Lord my God, that Thou hast brought me forth in peace. And even as Thou hast brought me forth in peace, so lead me in peace, guide my steps in peace, sustain me in peace, and save me from the power of the enemy and from him that lurketh by the way."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.10.24","24. To sum up: One should always offer supplications in regard to the future and ask for Divine mercies, and give thanks for the past, praising God and lauding Him according to one's abilities. The more one praises and lauds God, the more praiseworthy one is. And when he leaves the bath-house, he says: I give thanks to Thee, O Lord my God, that Thou hast saved me from the (excessive) heat."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.1","1. All blessings begin with the formula ""Blessed art Thou O Lord"" and conclude with the same formula; with the exception of the blessing said after the recital of the Shema, or a blessing immediately following a blessing connected with it, the blessing for fruits, and similar blessings as well as those said at the fulfillment of religious duties. Among these blessings, of which we have spoken, and which are in the nature of praise and thanksgiving, some begin with the formula ""Blessed art Thou, etc."" but do not so conclude; while others conclude with this formula but do not begin with it. There are still a few blessings recited at the fulfilment of religious duties, such as the blessing said at the reading of the Law and that said on viewing the graves of Israelites, which are in the nature of praise and thanksgiving (and nevertheless open and close with the formula ""Blessed art Thou etc""). All other blessings said at the fulfilment of religious duties, begin with the formula ""Blessed art Thou"" but do not so conclude."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.2","2. There are some affirmative precepts in regard to which there is an obligation sedulously to strive to fulfil them; as, for example, to put on phylacteries, dwell in a booth on the feast of Tabernacles, take in the hand a palm branch together with the other plants on that feast, hear the sound of the ram's horn on the New Year. These are termed obligatory because there is an unconditional obligation to fulfill them. Again there are religious duties which are not obligatory but are in a sense permissive; for example, to affix a <i>Mezuzah</i> to the doors of a house or build a parapet on the roof; since there is no obligation to dwell in a house that requires a <i>Mezuzah</i> to be affixed to it. One may, if one chooses, live all one's lifetime in a tent or on a ship. Similarly there is no obligation to build a house in order to erect a parapet round the roof. Every duty to God, whether permissive or obligatory, requires a blessing to be said before its fulfilment."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.3","3. So too, all religious duties ordained by the Scribes, whether these are according to their dicta, obligatory; (for example, to read the Scroll of Esther on the Feast of Lots, to kindle lights on the Eve of the Sabbath and during the feast of <i>Chanucah</i>); or whether these duties are optional,—for example, to make an <i>Erub</i><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Setting aside food on the eve of a festival, to permit the cooking of food on the festival for the Sabbath, or on the eve of a Sabbath to permit carrying on the Sabbath in a court or a town.</i> or to wash the hands<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**for prayers or meals.</i> all require, before they are performed, the recital of a blessing, containing the formula ""Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandment and commanded us (to perform that particular duty). Where in the Torah did God so command us? In the text (Deut. 17:11) ""… and according to the judgment which they tell thee, thou shalt do."" Hence, the meaning and purport of the Benedictory formula is as follows ""Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments among which Thou hast commanded us to give heed to those spiritual leaders who ordained that we should kindle the <i>Chanucah</i> light or read the Scroll of Esther."" This applies to all the other duties ordained by the Scribes."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.4","4. Why is no blessing said, when washing the hands at the close of a meal? Because this was only ordained as a precaution against danger to health,<sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">***Touching or rubbing the eyes with fingers to which strong salt may be adhering.</i> and acts that are of a precautionary character do not require the recital of a blessing. This is similar to the rule that, before drinking water at night, one strains it to avoid the risk of swallowing a leech. One does not, on such an occasion, recite a blessing ""And commanded us to strain water."" The same principle applies to all similar cases."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.5","5. If a person fulfilled a religious duty and omitted to say the appropriate blessing, he still says the blessing as long as the duty is in course of fulfilment. Once the fulfilment is past, he does not say the blessing. For example, when a man puts on a garment with <i>Zizith</i> (ritual fringes) or puts on phylacteries, or sits down in a booth on the Feast of Tabernacles, without reciting the appropriate blessing, he says, after having put on the garments with fringes, ""Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us to enwrap ourselves in a garment with fringes."" Similarly, after having put on phylacteries, he says the blessing ""Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to put on phylacteries;"" or after sitting down in the booth, he says ""Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to dwell in a booth."" And so in all similar cases [where the fulfillment of the duty is continuing, the blessing may be recited during its continuance, if he has not done so at the beginning]."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.6","6. But if he ritually slew a beast or fowl without reciting the blessing, he should not, after the slaying, recite the blessing ""Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us concerning ritual slaughter."" So too, if he had already covered the blood (of a fowl or clean wild beast), or set apart the priest's dues or levite's tithes, or taken a ritual bath, without saying the appropriate blessing, he should not say it after the religious duty had been discharged. The principle applies to all similar cases."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.7","7. There is one religious duty only where the blessing is said after the act to which it refers, namely the immersion of a proselyte (at his reception into Judaism). The reason is that, previously to the rite, he could not have said ""Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us,"" as he was neither sanctified nor commanded till he had taken the ritual bath. Hence he recites the blessing after the immersion, because, till that act had been performed, he was primarily ineligible and not qualified to say the blessing."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.8","8. Whenever the performance of a religious duty definitely completes the obligation, the blessing is recited at the time it is performed. Whenever the fulfillment of a precept is an antecedent to another precept, the blessing is said at the fulfillment of the latter. For example. A person builds a booth for the Feast of Tabernacles, prepares the palm branch for that festival, fashions a ram's horn for the New Year, puts fringes on a garment, or prepares phylacteries or a <i>Mezuzah</i>.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*slip of parchment containing passages of Scripture and affixed to the doors of rooms for habitation.</i> He does not, when preparing any of these articles of religious use, say the blessing ""Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to build a booth, prepare the palm branch, write phylacteries""; because the act in each of these cases is followed by another precept. When is the blessing said? When one sits in the booth (on the feast of Tabernacles), handles the palm branch, listens to the sound of the ram's horn (on the New Year) enwraps himself in the fringed garment, puts on phylacteries, affixes the <i>Mezuzah.</i> If however one erects a parapet on the roof, he recites, at the time of erection, the blessing ""Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us concerning a parapet""; and so with similar precepts."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.9","9. A precept which is fulfilled at definite periods, for example, listening to the sound of the ram's horn, sitting in the tabernacle, handling the palm branch, reading the Scroll of Esther, lighting the Chanucah light; likewise every precept, connected with private property, e.g. putting on a fringed garment or putting on phylacteries for the first time, fixing the <i>Mezuzah,</i> erection of a parapet on the roof; as also a precept, not of a continuous character, and for which the opportunity of fulfillment does not always occur, e.g. circumcision of a male infant, redemption of the first born,—each of these requires the blessing ""Who hast preserved us in life, etc."" to be said at the time of performance. If one omitted to say this blessing when building the tabernacle, or preparing the palm branch, he says it, when he fulfills his obligation connected therewith. This principle obtains in all similar cases."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.10","10. Whether one fulfills a religious duty for oneself or on behalf of others, he always, before doing it, says the blessing ""Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to do, etc."" The blessing ""Who hast preserved us in life, etc."" is only said when a precept is fulfilled on one's own behalf. If a person has several duties to perform, he does not say ""Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us concerning the precepts"", but, at the performance of each precept, he says the blessing appropriate to it."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.11","11. When fulfilling a religious duty—whether it be a personal obligation or not, if one does it for himself, he says, ""… and commanded us to do (the particular duty)"". If he does it on behalf of others, he says ""… and commanded us concerning the duty."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.12","12. For example, on putting on phylacteries, one says the blessing concluding ""… and commanded us to lay <i>Tephillin</i> (phylacteries)"". When putting on the <i>Tallith</i> (fringed garment), he says the blessing ending ""… to enwrap oneself in the fringed garment."" On taking a seat in the tabernacle (on the feast of Tabernacles), the blessing to be said ends ""to dwell in the tabernacle"". And so other blessings end ""to kindle the light for the Sabbath""; to read the <i>Hallel</i><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*The manuscript has <i>ligmor.</i> This means to <i>complete the Hallel</i> (Psalms 113-118).</i> (Psalms 113-118) recited on Festivals and on the Feast of Dedication. So too, if a person affixes the <i>Mezuzah,</i> to rooms in his own home, he ends the blessing—""to affix the <i>Mezuzah</i>."" If he builds a parapet for his own roof, he says the blessing ""Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to make a parapet."" If a person sets aside the priest's dues from his own produce, he says a blessing ending ""to set aside the dues"". If he circumcises his son, the blessing he says ends ""to circumcise the son"". If he slays his own paschal lamb or brings his festival offering, he says the blessing ending ""to slay, etc."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.13","13. But if he affixes a <i>Mezuzah</i> to the door of another's home, the blessing he says ends ""Concerning the affixing of a Mezuzah"". If he makes a parapet to the roof of a house belonging to others, he says a blessing concluding ""concerning the making of a parapet."" If he separates priests' dues for other owners' produce, he says a blessing ending ""concerning the setting apart of dues."" If he circumcises another person's male infant, he says the blessing ending ""concerning the circumcision."" The same principle applies to all similar cases."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.14","14. When a person fulfills a precept for himself and others jointly, and the precept is not of an obligatory character, he says a blessing which ends ""concerning the fulfillment of the precept."" Thus the blessing said, when making an <i>Erub,</i> ends ""concerning the precept of the <i>Erub</i>."" If the precept is obligatory and the intent was to discharge the obligation for himself and others, the blessing concludes ""to fulfill the precept."" Thus the blessing said at the sounding of the ram's horn (on the New Year) ends ""to hear the sound of the ram's horn."""
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.15","15. When a person takes the palm branch (on the feast of Tabernacles), he says the blessing ending ""concerning the taking of the palm-branch;"" because, as soon as he has taken it, he has discharged his obligation. If however one says the blessing before taking the palm branch, the blessing ends ""to take the palm-branch,"" on the analogy of the formula ""to dwell in the tabernacle."" Hence the general rule that when the blessing is said after the precept has been performed, the blessing ends with the formula ""concerning the precept."" But when one washes the hands or slaughters cattle for food, even for one's own consumption,—since these are optional, the blessings end with the respective formulas ""concerning the slaughtering of cattle;"" ""concerning covering the blood (of birds or deer);"" ""concerning washing of the hands."" So also the blessing said ""when searching for leaven on the evening after the 13th of Nisan"" ends ""concerning the destruction of leaven""—whether the search is on one's own behalf or for others; because, as soon as he has resolved in his mind to annul the leaven, the duty of destroying it has been discharged, before he begins the search,—as will be expounded in the proper place."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.16","16. For a practice that is only customary, even if traced to the prophets, for example, taking the willow branch on the seventh day of the feast of Tabernacles, and—needless to add—if it is ascribed to the Sages, for example, reciting the <i>Hallel</i><sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**Psalms 113-118 omitting 115:1-11 and 116:1-11.</i> on new moons and the intermediate days of Passover, no blessing is to be recited at its performance.<sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">***In the Ashkenazi ritual, a blessing is recited.</i> Thus also any act, in regard to which you are in doubt whether it requires a blessing or not, should be performed without a blessing. One should always carefully avoid saying blessings unnecessarily; and should be heedful to recite, as often as there may be occasion, the blessings that are requisite. And so David said ""Every day I will bless Thee and praise Thy name forever"" (Ps. 145:2)."
"LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS,.11.17",Blessed be the all merciful who hath aided us.
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.1,"1. Circumcision is an affirmative precept, the neglect of which entails the penalty of excision, as it is said, ""And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin—that soul shall be cut off from his people"" (Gen. 17:14). It is a duty incumbent upon the father to circumcise his son, and upon the master to circumcise his male slave, whether ""born in the house"" or bought with money. If the father or master failed to perform the circumcision, he has neglected the fulfillment of an affirmative precept but has not incurred the penalty of excision, to which only the uncircumcised person is made liable. In such case of neglect, the court is charged with the duty of circumcising the infant or slave at the appointed time, and must not leave any male uncircumcised among the Israelites or their slaves."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.2,"2. A male infant is not circumcised without the father's knowledge, unless the latter has neglected his duty and refrained from circumcising it. In this case, the Court has it circumcised even against the father's will. Should the child have escaped the notice of the Court, so that it did not have the child circumcised, then that person is under an obligation, when he grows up, to have himself circumcised. Every day that passes, after he is grown up, that he remains uncircumcised, he is neglecting the fulfillment of an affirmative precept. He does not however incur the penalty of excision till he has died, having wilfully remained uncircumcised."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.3,"3. The master is under an obligation to circumcise his male slaves, whether at birth they were his property or whether they had been acquired from a non-Israelite. There is a distinction however between these cases. A slave born in an Israelite's home is circumcised on the eighth day after birth; the slave bought with money, on the day that he is bought. Even if he was born on the day he was bought, he is circumcised on the same day."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.4,"4. Under certain circumstances, a slave acquired by purchase is circumcised on the eighth day after birth, while one born in the house is circumcised on the day he is born. For example, a female slave is bought, and her still unborn child is bought at the same time, the child, subsequently born, is circumcised when eight days old. For, although it had been separately bought, and is thus a slave acquired by purchase, still, as the mother had been acquired before the infant's birth, it is circumcised on the eighth day."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.5,"5. On the other hand, when a female slave was acquired for the sake of her offspring only (i.e. that her offspring might belong to the purchaser); or when she was acquired with the stipulation that she was not to take the ritual bath so as to have the status of a slave in an Israelite's home, though her subsequently born child is born as the property of the Israelite, it is circumcised on the day it is born; because this infant is as though it had been bought alone and had been bought on the day of its birth,—as the mother had not come within the category of an Israelite's female slave, so as to make her male child a slave ""born in the house"". Should she however, after delivery, have taken the ritual bath, the infant is circumcised on the eighth day."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.6,"6. If one acquired from an idolater, an adult slave who is unwilling to be circumcised, efforts are to be made for a period of twelve months to persuade him to submit to the rite. Should he at the end of this period still remain uncircumcised, he may not be retained but must be resold to a non-Israelite. But if, while he had still been with his non-Israelite master, the condition of sale had been made that he was not to be circumcised, he may be retained (by his new Jewish owner), though uncircumcised—provided that he undertakes to keep the seven Noachide precepts and he will then have the status of a proselyte of the gate. If he does not accept these seven precepts he is to be put to death (as a lawless individual). Proselytes of the gate are only received while the institution of the Jubilee is in force."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.7,"7. A proselyte must, before he can enter the communion of Israel be circumcised. If, while still a gentile, he had already been circumcised, it is requisite to draw a drop of blood from the <i>membrum,</i> on the day when he is received, as a sign of the covenant. Similarly, if a male infant is born with the prepuce absent, it is requisite to draw a drop of blood from the <i>membrum</i> when the infant is eight days old. An <i>androgyne</i> that has both male and female organs is to be circumcised on the eighth day. So too a male infant delivered by the Caesarean operation, or one born with two foreskins is to be circumcised on the eighth day."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.8,"8. Circumcisions are only performed during the daytime after sunrise, whether the operation takes place on the eighth day, the regular time, or subsequently, from the ninth day and further on, as it is said ""on the eighth <i>day</i>"" (Gen. 17:12) i.e. by day, and not at night. If the circumcision takes place after daybreak, it is correct. The whole of the day is proper for circumcision. Still it is a duty to perform it in the early part of the day, for the zealous fulfill their religious obligations at the earliest possible time."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.9,"9. When a circumcision takes place at the regular time (on the eighth day), it supersedes the prohibition of work on the Sabbath. But if it is to be performed after the regular time, it neither overrides the obligation of the Sabbath nor of the festivals. Whether performed at the regular time or not, it supersedes the obligation of the law of leprosy. If there was a bright leprous spot on the foreskin, the spot is cut off with the foreskin. For though the hacking of a leprous plague spot is prohibited, the affirmative precept (of circumcision) overrides the prohibition."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.10,"10. Even as the circumcision of male infants overrides the obligation of the Sabbath, so the circumcision of bondmen who are to be circumcised on the eighth day, overrides the obligation of abstinence from work on the Sabbath, should the eighth day fall on the Sabbath. To this rule there is an exception, namely, that of a bondman ""born in the house"", whose mother had not taken the ritual bath before the child was born. In this case, though the infant should be circumcised on the eighth day, the circumcision does not override the obligation of abstaining from work on the Sabbath."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.11,"11. When an infant was born ""circumcised"" (i.e. without a prepuce), or was delivered in the eighth month, after conception, while still immature—when it is considered to be in the category of a still-born child, as it may not live—; or if it was delivered by the Caesarean operation; or was an androgyne; or had two foreskins—in any of these cases the duty of circumcision on the eighth day does not override the obligation of the Sabbath. All such infants are circumcised on the first day of the week, which is the ninth day after birth."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.12,"12. If an infant is born (in the evening) when it is dusk and doubtful whether it is still day or already night, the eight days are counted from the night and the infant is circumcised on the nominally ninth day, which may in fact be the eighth day after its birth. If an infant is born on the eve of the Sabbath at dusk, the circumcision does not override the obligation of the Sabbath. It is circumcised on the first day of the week, since in a case when it is doubtful whether the Sabbath is the eighth day, the obligation of the Sabbath is not superseded."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.13,"13. If an eighth-month infant shows full development in its hair and nails, it is (regarded as) a mature seventh-month infant the delivery of which has been delayed. It may therefore (as a living being) be carried and taken from place to place on the Sabbath, and is not regarded as a stone (an inanimate object). It is circumcised on the Sabbath (should that be the eighth day after its birth). But if it was born with its hair undeveloped and its nails not perfectly formed as these are in normal infants, it is regarded as an eighth-month child that would not have been maturely developed till its ninth month, but that had been prematurely delivered while still immature. It is regarded as a stone (an inanimate object) and may not be moved on the Sabbath. Should it however live for thirty days, it is considered an infant capable of continued existence, and as in all respects like other infants; for an infant of the human species that survives for thirty days is no longer in the same category with the still-born."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.14,"14. A seventh-month infant that is fully formed is regarded as an infant expected to live, and is circumcised on the Sabbath. If it is doubtful whether such an infant is a seventh or an eighth-month child, it is, on either assumption, circumcised on the Sabbath. If it is, in fact, a seventh-month infant and mature, it is in accordance with the law that the circumcision should override the obligation of abstinence from work on the Sabbath. If it is an eighth-month child, the operator who circumcises it is regarded as cutting flesh, since an eighth-month infant is in the same category with a still-born child."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.15,"15. If the head of the foetus had emerged at dusk on the eve of the Sabbath, though complete delivery had not taken place till after night-fall of the Sabbath, the infant is not circumcised on a Sabbath. And in every case whenever a circumcision does not supersede the obligation to rest on the Sabbath, it likewise does not supersede the obligation to refrain from work on the first days of the festivals; but does supersede this obligation on the second days of the festivals. To this rule the New Year forms an exception. Circumcision (in cases where it would not supersede the obligation to rest on the Sabbath) does not supersede the duty to refrain from work on the first or on the second day of the New Year.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*both days being regarded as one long day.</i> So also, a circumcision, not taking place at the due time (on the eighth day after birth), does not supersede the obligation to refrain from work on the two days of the New Year."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.16,"16. A sick infant is not circumcised till it is well. Seven consecutive periods, each of twenty four hours, are counted from its recovery, after which it is circumcised. This applies to recovery from fever and similar illnesses. But if it had suffered from sore eyes, then as soon as the eyes are open and well, it is immediately circumcised. And so with similar disorders [that are localized and do not affect the general health]."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.17,"17. An infant found on the eighth day to be excessively yellow is not circumcised till the circulation has become normal, and its complexion is like that of other healthy infants. So too, if it was excessively ruddy, presenting the appearance of one who had been dyed red, it is not circumcised till the blood has been absorbed, and its complexion is like that of other infants—this redness being a disease. In these cases, great caution must be exercised."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.1.18,"18. When a woman's first male child was circumcised and died as a result of the operation, which lowered its vitality, and her second male child also died as a result of its circumcision,—whether that infant was by the same or by another husband,—her third male child must not be circumcised at the appointed period (on the eighth day). The operation must be deferred till the infant has grown and its constitutional vigour is established. No child may be circumcised, unless it is entirely free from disease, since danger to life is a factor that overrides everything else. It is possible to circumcise after the appointed time, but it is impossible to restore a life that is extinct."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.2.1,"1. All are qualified to perform the operation of circumcision. Where there is no adult circumcised male, (Israelite), it is performed by an uncircumcised Israelite, a bondman, a woman or a minor. But under no circumstances does a gentile circumcise. If however he has done so, the operation need not be repeated.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*According to the Ashkenazi practice a drop of blood must be drawn.</i> The circumcision may be performed with any instrument made of flint, glass or other material which cuts. One should not however use a reed for fear that splinters may hurt the child. The best method of fulfilling the precept is to use an iron instrument, such as a knife or shears. The universal custom in Israel is to use a knife."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.2.2,"2. How is circumcision performed? The entire foreskin which covers the glans is cut, so that the whole of the glans is exposed. Then the thin layer of skin (mucous membrane) beneath the foreskin in divided with the nail and turned back, till the flesh of the glans is completely exposed. The wound is then sucked till the blood has been drawn from parts remote (from the surface), thus obviating danger (to the child's health). The operator who omits to do so is removed from practice. After this has been done, a plaster, bandage, or similar dressing is applied."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.2.3,"3. There are some cases where shreds of skin that are left render the circumcision invalid. In others, they do not render it invalid. If so much of the foreskin remains as to cover the greater part of the glans, lengthwise, the infant is regarded as uncircumcised, as it was before the operation. This is a case of a shred of skin that invalidates the circumcision. If only a small portion of skin is left that does not cover the greater part of the length of the glans,—it is a filament, the non-removal of which does not invalidate the circumcision."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.2.4,"4. The operator, as long as he is still occupied with the circumcision, resumes his task to remove both kinds of shreds. But if he has completed the circumcision, he only resumes his task to remove these filaments, the non-removal of which would invalidate the circumcision, but not those which do not make it invalid. Should he have performed the circumcision and not drawn back the inner skin, (mucous membrane) it is as if he had not circumcised at all."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.2.5,"5. An infant whose flesh is tender and flaccid or who is fat, so that it appears as if it had not been circumcised, is to be examined during an erection. If it then seems circumcised, nothing need be done. Still the (flaccid) flesh should, for the sake of appearances, be pushed back on both sides. But if during erection, it does not appear circumcised, the flaccid flesh is cut away on both sides, so that the glans appears thoroughly exposed during erection. This is an ordinance of the scribes. But according to the Scriptual law, even if the infant appears uncircumcised, once the circumcision has taken place, it need not be repeated."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.2.6,"6. All the requisites that belong to the act of circumcision are done on the Sabbath. The foreskin is removed, the mucous <i>lamella</i> (inner layer of skin) retracted, the blood drawn by suction. If shreds of skin are left, such as would make the circumcision invalid, the operator resumes his task to remove them, even after he has completed the circumcision. If the shreds are such as would not invalidate the circumcision, he only does so if he is still engaged in the operation. A dressing is applied. But the <i>preliminary</i> preparations for the circumcision do not override the obligation of the Sabbath. For example, if a knife was not found, it may not be manufactured on the Sabbath. Nor may it be carried from place to place. And if no <i>Erub</i><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*the food set aside in this ritual on the eve of the Sabbath.</i> had been prepared to permit carrying through an alley communicating between two courts, the knife may not even be carried from one court to the other. For though the <i>Erub</i> is a Rabbinic ordinance, the necessity of bringing the knife does not override the requirement of compliance with the Erub; since the knife could have been brought on the day before the Sabbath."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.2.7,"7. So too, drugs for the dressing are not ground on the Sabbath; water is not heated, neither is a dressing prepared nor an emulsion of wine and oil mixed. If cummin seed (used as a styptic) had not been ground on the day before the Sabbath, the operator chews it with his teeth and applies it. If an emulsion of wine and oil had not been prepared, he applies each separately. The general principle is as follows: Whatever might have been prepared on the day before the Sabbath does not supersede the obligation of the Sabbath. If the requisites had been forgotten and not been provided, the circumcision is put off to the ninth day."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.2.8,"8. If, after the circumcision, the warm water for bathing the infant had been spilt, or the drugs (for the dressing) had been scattered, everything needed is prepared on the Sabbath day so as to avoid danger to the child. Where it is the practice to bathe the infant, this is done on the Sabbath when the circumcision takes place, before or after the operation, and also on the third day after the operation, should that day fall on the Sabbath. The bathing takes place, of the whole body or of the genitals only, according to the local custom, with water which had been kept warm from the previous day, or which had to be heated on the Sabbath, since the omission of the ablution might be dangerous to the infant."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.2.9,"9. If, through forgetfulness, the knife had not been brought on the day before the Sabbath, a non-Israelite is directed to bring it,—provided that he does not carry it through the public thoroughfare. The general principle may be stated as follows: Whatever we are forbidden to do by Rabbinic ordinance, as a precaution to prevent Sabbath violation, we may direct a gentile to do, to enable us to fulfill a religious precept at the proper time. But whatever is forbidden to be done by us on the Sabbath because it is work, we may not ask a gentile to do on the Sabbath."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.2.10,"10. The requisite preliminaries in preparation for the circumcision—even when it is to take place on the proper day, do not supersede the obligation of abstaining from work on the festival, since these could have been prepared on the day before the festival. This can be deduced <i>a fortiori.</i> Since the preparation of preliminaries to circumcision do not supersede a prohibition which is a precaution to prevent Sabbath violation, and which is only a Rabbinic ordinance, how can it supersede a prohibition of work on the festivals which is expressly forbidden in the Scriptures. Drugs, however, that are required for the circumcision are ground on the festival, since they can be used for cooking (as spices).<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**Cooking is permitted on the festivals that fall on the working days of the week. (Exodus 12:16.)</i> So too, wine and oil may be beaten up as an emulsion (to be used after the operation)."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.3.1,"1. Before circumcising, the operator recites the blessing, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and given us command concerning circumcision."" This blessing is said by him when he circumcises the son of another person. If he was circumcising his own son, the formula he recites is … ""and commanded us to circumcise the son."" In either case, the father of the child recites another blessing also: ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us to make him enter into the covenant of Abraham, our ancestor."" The duty is incumbent upon the father to have his son circumcised; and this is in addition to the obligation that rests on all Israelites to circumcise any male person among them. Hence, if the father is not present at the circumcision, the second blessing is not recited after it. One authority decided that in such a case, the Ecclesiastical court or one of those present should say this blessing. It is, however, not right to do so."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.3.2,"2. If there are persons present, they say (to the father) ""Even as thou hast brought him into the covenant, so mayest thou lead him to the study of the Torah, to marriage and to the performance of good deeds. The father, operator or any one else present says, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, Who, from the womb didst sanctify the well-beloved (Isaac), and didst set Thy statute in his flesh, and seal his offspring with the sign of the holy covenant. On this account, O living God, our Portion and our Rock, give command to deliver from destruction the dearly beloved of our flesh for the sake of the covenant which Thou hast set in our flesh. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who makest the covenant."" The father of the child recites the blessing ""Who hast preserved us in life.""<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Not the custom of the Ashkenazim.</i>"
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.3.3,"3. One who circumcises proselytes says the blessing, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to circumcise proselytes and draw from them the blood of the covenant. For if it were not for the blood of the covenant, Heaven and Earth would not have endured, even as it is said ""Were it not for My Covenant by day and night, I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth"" (Jerem. 33-25)."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.3.4,"4. If one circumcises his own bondman, he says the blessing, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to circumcise bondmen and draw from them blood of the covenant; for if it were not for the blood of the covenant, Heaven and Earth would not exist. If one circumcises a bondman belonging to other persons, the formula recited is … ""concerning the circumcision of bondmen."" When an adult is circumcised, the private parts must be covered till after the blessing has been said; and then uncovered while the circumcision is performed."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.3.5,"5. If a proselyte had been circumcised before he became a proselyte, or if a male infant was born apparently circumcised, (i.e. with the prepuce deficient) no blessing is recited when a drop of blood is drawn from the virile member. So too, no blessing is said at the circumcision of an androgyne (<i>hermaphrodite</i>), since the subject is not positively (and exclusively) a male."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.3.6,"6. When a heathen needs to be circumcised because a wound of boil had formed in that part, an Israelite was (in ancient times) forbidden to perform the operation, on the principle that nothing is to be done to rescue idolaters from death or occasion it in their case. And this was the rule despite the possibility that this cure might be a religious act<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*as the patient might have wished to become an Israelite.</i> since no such intent had been expressed. Hence, if the idolater had the intent, expressed or otherwise known, that the operation should be a ritual circumcision (of a proselyte), an Israelite may perform the operation."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.3.7,"7. The foreskin is regarded as an abomination, for which the gentiles are contemned in Scripture, as it is said ""For all the nations are uncircumcised (Jer. 9-25). An important institution is Circumcision. For the Patriarch Abraham was not called perfect till he had circumcised himself, as it is said, ""Walk thou before me; and be thou perfect. And I will make my covenant between Me and thee"" (Gen. 17:1-2). Whoever neglects the covenant of our ancestor Abraham, and retains the foreskin or artificially obliterates the marks of circumcision, even if he has acquired much knowledge of the Torah and practises good deeds, will have no portion in the world to come."
LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.3.8,"8. Mark how strictly the observance of Circumcision is to be regarded. Moses, although he was on a journey did not receive indulgence a single hour for neglecting this duty. In connection with all the precepts of the Torah, three covenants were made with Israel; as it is said ""These are the words of the covenant which the Lord commanded … beside the covenant which He made with them in Horeb"" (Deut. 28:69). And in the next section it is said ""Ye are standing this day all of you before the Lord your God … that thou shouldst enter into the covenant of the Lord thy God"" (Deut. 29:9-11). Three covenants are here mentioned. But in connection with Circumcision, thirteen covenants were made with our ancestor Abraham: ""And I will make My covenant between Me and thee"" (Gen. 17:2); ""As for me. behold, My covenant is with thee"" (ib. 17:4); ""And I will establish My covenant between Me and thee"" (ib. 17:7); ""for an everlasting covenant"" (ib. 17:7); ""And as for thee, thou shalt keep My covenant"" (ib. 17:9); ""This is My covenant which you shall keep"" (ib. 17:10) ""And it shall be a token of a covenant"" (ib. 17:11); ""And My covenant shall be in your flesh"" (ib. 17:13); ""for an everlasting covenant"" (ib. 17:13); ""he hath broken my covenant"" (ib. 17:14); ""And I will establish My covenant with him"" (ib. 17:19); ""for an everlasting covenant"" (ib. 17:19); ""But My covenant I will establish with Isaac"" (ib. 17:21)."

LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION.3.11,"Blessed be He Who giveth strength to the weary. (<i>In Maimonides' own handwriting</i>): Corrected from my book. I Moses, son of Maimon, of blessed memory."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.1","1. The fringe that is attached to the corner of the garment, and made of the same species of material as the garment, is called <i>Tzitzith</i> Fringes, because it is like the fringes of hair of the head, as it is said, ""And he took me up by the lock (<i>Tzitzith</i>) of my head"" (Ezekiel 8:3). This fringe is called ""the White (part)"", because we are not commanded to dye it. No definite number of threads is prescribed in the Torah for the fringes."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.2","2. A thread of wool, dyed the color of the sky, is taken and wound round the fringe. This thread is called <i>Techeleth,</i> the blue (thread). The number of times this thread should be wound is not specified in the Torah."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.3","3. This precept thus consists of two ordinances;—to attach to the corner of the garment a fringe projecting from it, and to wind a blue thread round the fringe, as it is said, ""Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them a fringe upon the corners of their garments … and that they put upon the fringe of each corner a thread of blue"" (Numbers 16:38)."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.4","4. The absence of the blue thread does not bar the use of the white fringe. Nor does the absence of the white fringe prevent the use of the blue thread. How so? If a person has no blue thread, he puts in the white fringe alone. So too, if the white fringe and the blue thread have been attached and the white fringe has been severed and diminished up to the corner of the garment and only the blue thread was left, it is fit for use."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.5","5. Though the non-fulfillment of either ordinance does not bar the observance of the other ordinance, they are not two precepts but one precept. The ancient sages said, ""The text 'and it shall be unto you for a fringe' "", teaches that both ordinances form one precept. The four fringes on the garment are, all of them, indispensable, for the attachment of all the four constitute one precept. Whoever puts on a garment with white fringes or a blue thread or with both together has fulfilled one affirmative precept."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.6","6. How are the fringes attached? One begins at the corner of the garment, that is, at the edge of the woven cloth, and measures off a length not greater than three finger-breadths and not less than the length between the base of the thumbnail and the first joint. Four threads are inserted there and turned down in the middle, so that eight twined threads are pendent from the corner, The eight threads are not to be less than four finger-breadths long. If longer, even as much as one or two cubits, they are fit for use. The breadth of the thumb is the standard for all finger-breadths. One of the eight threads should be blue, and seven should be white."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.7","7. One of the white threads is taken up and wound once about the other threads close to the garment. It is then dropped. The blue thread is then taken and wound twice about the other threads close to the winding with the white thread. The threads are then tied. These three windings are called a section. A small space is left; a second section is made, the windings being done with the blue thread only. A small space is left; a third section is made; and so till the last division where the blue thread is wound round the other threads twice and the third winding is done with a white thread, because, as the winding began with a white thread, it should also end with a white thread, on the principle that things sacred may be elevated to a higher degree but may not be degraded to a lower degree. The reason why the winding begins with a white thread is that the corner of the garment shall have adjacent to it threads of the same kind of material. This is the method followed with the four corners."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.8","8. How many divisions are made in the fringes at each corner? Not less than seven and not more than thirteen. This is the choicest mode of carrying out the precept. But if one wound the threads, to form one division only, the fringe is regarded as correctly made. And if one wound the blue thread over the greater portion of the fringes, it is correctly made. The beauty of the blue thread is manifested if all the sections that are wound take up the first third of the pendent fringes, while the remaining two thirds are loose. The threads in this part need to be separated, so that they shall be like the fringes of hair on the head."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.9","9. When a person uses white threads only without a blue thread, he takes one of the eight threads and winds it around the others to the extent of a third of the length, leaving two thirds for the loose fringe. With regard to this winding, if he desires to make divided sections as is done when a blue thread is used, he is at liberty to do so. And this is our custom. If, on the other hand, he desires to make the winding without divisions, he may do so. In short, what he should aim at is that the part wound shall be a third of the length and the fringe two thirds. Some pay no attention to this point, when only white threads are used. If one of the white threads has been wound round the greater portion of their length, or if only a single division has been made, the fringes are regarded as proper."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.10","10. The white as well as the blue threads may be twined, if so desired. Even if the thread consisted of eight threads folded and twined so that it becomes a cord, it is still regarded as one thread only."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.11","11. The threads used for the fringes, whether white or blue, must be spun with the express intention of being made into fringes. They are not made of wool caught by the thorns where the sheep lie down, nor from the wisps that are plucked from the animal, nor from the remainders of the warp left by the weaver on the selvage of the cloth, but only of the wool-shearing or of flax. Nor are the fringes to be made from wool that has been part of the proceeds of a robbery, or that comes from a city that has gone astray (Deuteronomy 13:13-18), nor from wool of beasts set apart for sacrifice. If such wool has been used for fringes, the latter are unfit for use. If a person prostrates himself in worship before a beast, its wool is unfit for use as fringes. But if he so prostrates himself before planted flax, it is fit for use, because its character has been changed.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*The flax has been turned into linen.</i>"
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.12","12. Fringes made by a non-Israelite are unfit for use, for it is said, ""Speak unto the <i>children of Israel</i> and bid them that <i>they</i> make them … fringes"" (Numbers 15:38). But if an Israelite made them without thinking of their purpose, they are fit for use. Completed fringes attached to a garment are unfit for use."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.13","13. For example, if one took the corner of a garment that had fringes and sewed it on to another garment, even if the corner was a cubit long and a cubit wide, the fringes are unfit for use, for it is said, ""They shall make unto themselves fringes"" (Numbers 15:38) but not attach those already made—this being analogous to a thing that came into existence of itself. It is however allowable to undo the fringes from one garment and insert them in another, whether the fringes are white or blue."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.14","14. If threads were suspended from one corner of a garment to another and the threads in each corner were tied according to the prescribed rules, after which the threads were severed in the middle, so as to form separate fringes, they are unfit for use, because at the time when the threads were tied they were unfit for use, the two corners being connected by the threads between them, and they only became two fringes when they were severed, so that they were made out of fringes already completed."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.15","15. When a person inserted additional fringes in a garment that already had them, if his intent was to nullify the first set of fringes, he is to undo these or cut them off, and the set subsequently added is fit for use. If however his intent was to add the second set, then, even if he cuts off either of the sets, the one remaining is unfit for use, because by the addition he made all the fringes unfit; and when he undid or cut off a superfluous set of fringes, the one remaining turns out to have been fashioned out of that which had already been complete, and the first time it had been made it was unfit."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.16","16. So too if one inserts fringes in a garment with three corners and then makes a fourth corner and inserts a fringe in it, the fringes are all unfit for use, for it is said, ""Thou shalt make fringes"" (Deuteronomy 22:12) and not use those already made."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.17","17. A garment is not to be folded and fringes inserted in the garment as folded, unless one of the edges at least is sewn up."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.1.18","18. If the corner of the garment in which fringes have been inserted has become torn, and the tear is more than three fingers' breadth from the edge, it can be sewn up. If the tear is less than three fingers' breadth from the edge, it cannot be sewn up. If the space between the opening into which the fringes are inserted and the edge of the woven fabric has become less, (owing to the edge having worn away) the fringes are fit for use, provided that some portion of the fabric, however small, is still left. So also, if the threads of the fringes have become less in length, they are fit for use, provided that enough of them is left to make a loop. But if even a single thread has been severed at the point where the fringes are inserted, they are unfit."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.2.1","1. Blue thread, wherever it is mentioned in the Torah, is wool dyed azure, the color of the firmament seen in a blue sky when the sun is shining. The blue thread mentioned in connection with fringes must be dyed with a special dye which retains its lustre without change. Wool that has not been dyed in this dye is unfit for use as the blue thread, even though it is of the color of the sky; as, for instance, if it has been dyed with indigo, lamp-black or other darkening material, it cannot be used as the thread of blue with the fringe. The wool of a ewe whose dam was a she-goat is unfit for use as fringes."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.2.2","2. How are the blue threads used with the fringes to be dyed? Wool is soaked in lime and afterwards washed till it is clean. It is then scalded in a solution of alum and similar substances such as are used by dyers, so that it may take the color. The blood of the <i>Chalazon</i> is then taken,—a fish the color of which is azure while its blood is black as ink. This fish is found in the Dead Sea. The blood is put into a cauldron together with other ingredients such as potash and similar substances used by dyers, and brought to a boiling point. The wool is immersed in the cauldron till it has assumed the hue of the sky. This is the blue thread used with the fringes."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.2.3","3. The blue thread of the fringes must be dyed with that express intent. If it has been dyed without this intent, it is unfit for use. If a little wool was dyed in the cauldron containing the coloring material as a test, in order to ascertain whether the color is good or not, the entire contents of the cauldron become unfit. How then is one to proceed? A small portion of the cauldron's contents should be removed into a small vessel. In this, the wool used for testing should be placed, and subsequently burnt, because it was dyed for testing purposes. The dye in the vessel used for testing is also poured away because its being used for testing has rendered it unfit to be used for dyeing the blue thread. The wool which is to serve as the blue thread is dyed in the rest of the dye which has not been spoilt."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.2.4","4. The blue thread is only to be purchased from a reliable expert. Otherwise there is reason to apprehend that it was not dyed with the express intent to be used with the fringes. Even though it had been bought of an expert, if it was afterwards ascertained that it had been dyed with one of the dark dyes that do not keep the color fast, it is unfit for use."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.2.5","5. How is it tested, in order to determine whether it has been dyed in accordance with the legal requirements or not? Straw is taken, together with snail's slime and urine that has been permitted to stand for forty days. The wool is immersed in the mixture for a period of twenty-four hours. If the wool keeps its color and does not become paler, it is fit for use. If however it has become paler, dough of barley flour that had been put aside to become stale for fish sauce is taken. Into it, the blue thread, the color of which has faded is placed. The dough is baked in an oven. The blue thread is taken out of the loaf and examined. If it has become still paler, it is unfit for use. If the color is richer and darker than it had been before baking, it is fit for use."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.2.6","6. In a market where blue thread is sold for fringes, and where the vendors have a reputation for trustworthiness, blue thread may be purchased without enquiry. No investigation is necessary, the benefit of the presumption continuing till suspicion of untrustworthiness arises. If blue thread was deposited with a non-Israelite, it is unfit for use, for fear that the depositary may have substituted other blue thread. If it was in a receptacle sealed with two seals, one within the other, it continues fit for use. If only one seal had been affixed, it becomes unfit for use."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.2.7","7. Blue threads, found in the street, are unfit for use, even if they are found severed (in the usual lengths). If however they are twined they are fit for use. A garment with fringes is presumed to be fit for use, if bought from an Israelite. It likewise has the benefit of this presumption if purchased from a non-Israelite tradesman. But if the non-Israelite is a private person, the fringes are unfit for use."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.2.8","8. If a garment is entirely red or green, or of any other color, the fringes which ordinarily are white should be of the same color as the garment; green, if it is green, red, if it is red. If the garment is entirely blue, the ordinary fringes should be of any color except black,—black resembling blue. One blue thread is wound round the other fringes just as is done in the case of other fringes that are not colored."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.2.9","9. Not to attach white fringes to one's garment is more culpable than to omit the blue thread. For the white fringes are procurable by all, while the blue thread cannot be obtained in all places and at all times on account of the need of the special dye, of which we have spoken."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.3.1","1. The garment in which one is bound by scriptural enactment to insert fringes, is a garment that has four corners or more than four corners; its dimensions must be sufficient to cover the head and greater portion of the body of a child that walks by itself in the street and does not need any one to watch it and accompany it; furthermore the garment has to be of wool or linen."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.3.2","2. Garments of other materials such as silk, cotton, camel's hair, hares' down, goats' hair, etc., only require fringes by the ordinance of the sages—to make us heedful of the precept concerning Fringes, and their ordinance also applies to garments with four or more corners and of the dimensions above stated; for wherever the Torah speaks of garments without special qualification, it refers exclusively to such as are of wool or linen."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.3.3","3. ""On the four corners of thy vesture"" (Deuteronomy 22:12). This means that a garment requires fringes when it has four corners but not when it has three. But cannot the text also mean that the garment must have four fringes but not five? To guard against this inference, the text concludes, ""wherewith thou coverest thyself"", i.e., even if it has five corners or more. Why however should a garment with five corners be included in the obligation and one with three corners be exempted, seeing that neither has four corners? The answer is that the number five includes the number four. Accordingly, when fringes are inserted in a garment with five or six corners, they are to be inserted in those four of the five or six corners, that are furthest from each other, for it is said, ""On the four corners of thy vesture."""
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.3.4","4. A garment made of cloth (as specified above) and the corners of which are of leather requires fringes. A garment of leather, the corners of which are of cloth is exempt, since the main part of the garment alone is taken into consideration. A garment owned by two partners requires fringes, for it is said, ""in the corners of their garments"" (Numbers 15:38). The word ""thy vesture"" (Deuteronomy 22:12) is only intended to exclude a borrowed garment from the obligation of fringes. Such a garment is exempt for thirty days, after which fringes must be inserted."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.3.5","5. For a woolen garment, the white fringes are to be of wool. For a garment of flaxen material (linen) the white fringes are to be threads of linen, these being of the same species. For garments of other materials, the white fringes are to be threads of the same material as the garment, threads of silk for a garment of silk; goats' hair threads for a garment of goats' hair. If one desires to use woolen or flaxen (linen) threads as fringes for garments made of any other materials, he may do so. The reason is that fringes of wool or flax (linen) satisfy the requirements of the law whether the garments are of the same species of material or not; while fringes of other species are permissible when the garments are of the same species as the fringes but not when they are different."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.3.6","6. May woolen threads be used as fringes in a garment of flaxen material, or flaxen threads in a woolen garment, even when only white fringes are inserted? According to the strict rule, this should be permissible, since the prohibition of a mixture of wool and flax is suspended in the case of fringes, the blue thread which is of wool being inserted in a garment of flax (linen). Why then is this not done? Because threads of the same material as the garment can be used as fringes. And wherever there are a positive precept and a negative precept, both of which can be observed, this should be done. Where they conflict, the affirmative overrides the negative commandment. In this case, however, both precepts can be observed."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.3.7","7. In a garment of flax (linen), the blue thread is not inserted, but only white fringes of flaxen (linen) thread. This is not because the precept concerning fringes is superseded by the prohibition of a mixture of wool and flax. But it is a precautionary regulation of the sages who had in mind that such a garment might be worn at night when there is no obligation to have fringes on the garments, and so a prohibition would be violated at a time when there was no (over-riding) affirmative precept in force, since the duty of having fringes is incumbent by day and not at night, as it is said, ""that ye may look upon it"" (Numbers 15:39) which means at a time when it can be seen. A blind man is under the obligation of having fringes in his garments; for, although he does not see the fringes, others see them."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.3.8","8. It is permitted to put on a garment with fringes at night, during the working week-days as well as on the Sabbath, notwithstanding that the precept is not obligatory at night—provided however that the blessing for the fringes is not recited. At what time in the morning is the blessing for the fringes recited? From the time when the white fringes can be distinguished from the blue thread. What is the form of the blessing? ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to enwrap ourselves in a garment with fringes"". And whenever, during the day such a garment is put on, the blessing is recited before putting it on. When fringes are inserted in a garment, no blessing is recited; the consummation of the precept is putting on the fringed garment."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.3.9","9. It is permissible, while clad in a garment with fringes, to enter a lavatory (privy) or bath house. If threads either of the white fringes, or the blue cord, have been severed, the fringes may be thrown on the waste-heap, because the fringes though used in the fulfillment of a precept, have no intrinsic sanctity. It is forbidden to sell a garment with fringes to a non-Israelite, unless the fringes are unwound; not because any sanctity attaches to them, but for fear that the non-Israelite, wearing the garment with fringes, may be joined on the road by an Israelite who will deem him a co-religionist, and the Gentile may murder the Israelite."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.3.10","10. Women, bondsmen and minors are exempted by the Scriptural law from the obligation of having fringes in their garments. The Sages however have prescribed that a male child, as soon as he can put on a garment, is under the obligation of having a garment with fringes, so as to be trained in religious observances. If women or bondsmen desire to wear garments with fringes, no objection is raised, but they do not recite the blessing. The same is the rule with respect to other affirmative precepts from the obligation of which women are exempt. If they wish to fulfill them without reciting the blessing, no objection is raised. Persons of doubtful sex and a hermaphrodite, because of the doubt, are under the obligation to fulfill all the precepts. Hence, they do not recite the blessing, but fulfill the duty without pronouncing the benediction."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.3.11","11. How is the obligation of the precept of fringes incurred? Anyone upon whom the fulfillment of this precept is incumbent, desirous of putting on a garment that requires fringes, must first insert them and then may put on the garment. If he puts it on before the fringes have been attached, he has neglected an affirmative precept. But garments to which fringes should be attached are exempt as long as no one has worn them and they are kept folded and put away, because the obligation does not attach to the garment, but is incumbent upon the owner of a garment (who wears it)."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.3.12","12. Although one is not bound to purchase a garment and wear it, so as to insert fringes therein, still it is not right for a pious man to release himself from the observance of this commandment. He should always endeavour to be robed in a garment that requires fringes, so as to fulfill this precept. He should be especially heedful of this, during prayer. For scholars it is particularly disgraceful to recite the prayers without being so robed."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.3.13","13. At all times, a person should be heedful of the precept concerning fringes, since Holy Writ estimates it as so weighty that all the commandments are made dependent upon it, as it is said, ""And ye shall look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord"" (Numbers 15:39)."
"LAWS OF FRINGES,.3.14","Blessed be the All-Merciful, who hath aided us."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.1.1","1. To pray daily is an affirmative duty, as it is said, ""And ye shall serve the Lord, your God"" (Exodus 23:25). The service, here referred to, according to the teaching of tradition, is Prayer, as it is said, ""And to serve Him with all your heart"" (Deuteronomy 11:13), on which the sages commented, ""What may be described as Service of the Heart? Prayer"". The number of prayers is not prescribed in the Torah. No form of prayer is prescribed in the Torah. Nor does the Torah prescribe a fixed time for Prayer. Hence, women and slaves are under an obligation to pray, this being a duty, the fulfillment of which is independent of set periods."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.1.2","2. The obligation in this precept is that every person should daily, according to his ability, offer up supplication and prayer; first uttering praises of God, then, with humble supplication and petition ask for all that he needs, and finally offer praise and thanksgiving to the Eternal for the benefits already bestowed upon him in rich measure."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.1.3","3. One who was fluent, would offer up many prayers and supplications. If one was slow of speech, he would pray as he could and whenever he pleased. Thus also, the number of separate services depended on an individual's ability. One would pray once daily; others, several times in the day. All, however, turned during prayer to the Sanctuary, in whichever direction that might be. This was the uniform practice from the times of Moses to those of Ezra."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.1.4","4. When the people of Israel went into exile in the days of the wicked Nebucednezzar, they mingled with the Persians, Greeks and other nations. In those foreign countries, children were born to them, whose language was confused. Everyone's speech was a mixture of many tongues. No one was able, when he spoke, to express his thoughts adequately in any one language, otherwise than incoherently, as it is said, ""And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod and they could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people"" (Nehemiah 13:24)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.1.5","5. Consequently, when anyone of them prayed in Hebrew, he was unable adequately to express his needs or recount the praises of God, without mixing Hebrew with other languages. When Ezra and his Council realized this condition, they ordained the Eighteen Benedictions in their present order."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.1.6","6. The first three blessings consist of praises of God and the last three, of thanksgiving to Him. The intermediate benedictions are petitions for the things which may stand as categories of all the desires of the individual and the needs of the community. The object aimed at was that these prayers should be in an orderly form in everyone's mouth, that all should learn them, and thus the prayer of those who were not expert in speech would be as perfect as that of those who had command of a chaste style. For the same reason, they arranged [in a fixed form] all the blessings and prayers for all Jews so that the substance of every blessing should be familiar and current in the mouth of one who is not expert in speech."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.1.7","7. Thus, too, they ordained that the Services of Prayer should be equal in number to the Sacrifices—two services of prayer daily, corresponding to the two daily offerings. And for the day on which an additional offering was ordained, they instituted a third prayer, corresponding to the additional offering. The Service which corresponds to the daily morning sacrifice is called the Morning Prayer. The Service which corresponds to the Afternoon Sacrifice is called the Afternoon Prayer, and the Service corresponding to the Additional offering is called the Additional Prayer."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.1.8","8. So also they ordained that a person should recite one service of Prayer at night, since the portions of the animal offered up as the Afternoon Sacrifice were consumed on the altar throughout the night, as it is said, ""This is the law of the burnt offering; this it is that which goeth up on its firewood upon the altar all night"" (Leviticus 6:2). And in this sense it is said, ""Evening and morning and at noon will I meditate and cry aloud, and He hath heard my voice"" (Psalms 55:18). The Evening Service is not obligatory like the Morning and Afternoon Services. Nevertheless all Israelites, wherever they have settled, have adopted the practice of reciting the Evening Service and have accepted it as obligatory."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.1.9","9. So, too, they instituted a service to be recited after the afternoon service, close to sunset, but only on a fast day, the purpose being to add petitions and supplication on account of the fast. This Service is called ""the Closing"" [service]—an allusion to the fact that the sky is closed to the sun which is at that hour of the day invisible—this service being recited near sunset."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.1.10","10. Thus the Services recited daily are three; namely, the Evening Service, the Morning Service and the Afternoon Service. On Sabbaths, Festivals and New Moons, they are four—the three daily services and the Additional Service. On the Day of Atonement, they are five services, the four just mentioned and the <i>Neilah,</i> the closing service."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.1.11","11. The number of these services may not be diminished but may be increased. If a person wishes to pray the whole day, he may do so. And the prayers he adds are accounted to him as if he brought free-will offerings. He must accordingly add in each of the middle blessings a thought appropriate to the particular blessing. If this is done in one of the blessings only, that is sufficient, the object being to make it manifest that the prayer is voluntary and not obligatory. In the first three and last three blessings there must be no addition, diminution or change."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.1.12","12. A congregation does not hold a voluntary service, because the community never brought a free-will offering. Additional services (those recited on Sabbaths, Festivals and New Moons), may not be recited twice [even by a private individual], once by way of discharging an obligatory duty and once voluntarily, because the additional sacrifices were never brought as free-will offerings. One of the Geonim decided that it is forbidden to recite any voluntary service on Sabbaths and Festivals, since on those days no free-will offerings were brought but only those that were obligatory."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.1","1. In Rabban Gamliel's days, the number of heretics in Israel increased. They were wont to vex the Israelites and seduce them to turn away from God. When R. Gamliel realized that the most urgent need was to remove this evil, he composed a Benediction which contains a petition to God to destroy the heretics, and incorporated it in the Eighteen Blessings so that it should be in a fixed form for all. Hence the total number of Blessings in the Daily Service is Nineteen."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.2","2. In each of the three daily services, a person recites these nineteen blessings in their appointed order. But only if he finds that his mind is in a fit state for prayer and he is fluent in speech.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*He knows the blessing correctly.</i> But if one is distracted and harassed, or is not fluent in speech, he should recite the first three blessings, a blessing embodying the gist of all the intermediate blessings, and the last three blessings, and then he has fulfilled his duty."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.3","3. The Blessing that they ordained as a summary of the intermediate blessings is as follows: Give us understanding, O Lord, our God, to know Thy ways, and circumcise our hearts to fear Thee. Be forgiving unto us, so that we may be redeemed. Keep us far from sorrow. Make us prosperous. Cause us to dwell in the pastures of Thy land. Gather the scattered from the four [corners of the earth]. Let them that go astray in the knowledge of Thee be judged;<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*According to another reading, ""Let them that go astray [learn to] judge according to the [true] knowledge of Thee."" (Rashi quoting Halachoth Gedoloth) Rabbenu Jonah renders, ""Let them that go astray be judged according to Thy knowledge.""</i> and over the wicked wave Thy hand. Let the righteous rejoice in the rebuilding of Thy city and in the reestablishment of Thy temple, and in the flourishing of the horn of David, Thy servant, and in the rekindling of the light of Jesse's son, Thine anointed. Before we call, do Thou answer; before we speak, do Thou hearken; as it is said, ""And it shall come to pass, before they call, I will answer; while they are still speaking, I will hear"" (Isaiah 65:24); for Thou art He who answereth in all times of trouble, who delivereth and rescueth from all distress, Blessed art Thou O Lord who hearkenest unto prayer."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.4","4. The foregoing rule only applies to the summer season. But in the winter the summary of the intermediate blessings is not recited; because, in the blessing for a prosperous year, the petition for dew and rain has to be recited. So also, this summary is not recited in the Evening Prayer at the close of Sabbath or Festival, because in the Blessing for Granting Understanding, the paragraph relating to the distinction between sacred and profane has to be added."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.5","5. On Sabbaths and Festivals, seven blessings are recited in each of the four Services for the day; namely, the usual first three blessings, and last three blessings, and an intermediate blessing appropriate to the particular day. On Sabbaths, the intermediate blessing concludes with the formula, ""Who hallowest the Sabbath."" On the Festivals it concludes, ""Who hallowest Israel and the Seasons."" And on a Sabbath which is at the same time a festival, the concluding formula is, ""Who hallowest the Sabbath, Israel and the Seasons."" On New Year, the conclusion is, ""King over all the earth, who hallowest Israel and the Day of Memorial."" When the New Year falls on a Sabbath, the concluding formula is, ""King over all the earth, who hallowest the Sabbath, Israel and the Day of Memorial."""
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.6","6. The foregoing statement applies to the evening, morning and afternoon services of the New Year. But the additional service on the New Year consists of nine blessings; the first three and the last three recited daily, and three Intermediate. Of these intermediate benedictions, the theme of the first is God's Sovereignty; of the second His remembrance; while the third has references to the Shofar. Each of these blessings concludes with a formula appropriate to its theme."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.7","7. On the Day of Atonement, in each of the five services, seven blessings are recited, the first three, the last three, and an intermediate blessing, appropriate to the day, which concludes, ""King over the whole earth, who sanctifiest Israel and the Day of Atonement."" If that day happens to fall on a Sabbath, the intermediate blessing in each service concludes, ""King over the whole earth, who sanctifiest the Sabbath, Israel and the Day of Atonement."""
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.8","8. The foregoing statement applies to the Fast of the Day of Atonement in ordinary years but on that fast-day in the Jubilee year, nine blessings are recited in the additional service as in the additional service of the New Year. The same blessings are recited, neither more nor less, and are only recited when the law of the Jubilee is in force."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.9","9. Before reciting the first blessing in each of the services, one begins, ""O Lord, open Thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise,"" (Psalms 51:7) and after concluding the service, one adds, ""Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before Thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer,"" (Psalms 19:15), after which the worshipper steps backward."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.10","10. On New Moons and on the intermediate days of the festivals, the nineteen blessings are recited for the evening, morning and afternoon services, as on ordinary days; and the prayer beginning, ""O our God and God of our fathers, may our remembrance rise, come, etc."" is incorporated in the blessing referring to the restoration of the ancient service. The additional service on the intermediate days of the festivals is the same as on the feast itself. On New Moons, one recites for the additional service, the first three and the last three blessings (common to all services) and an intermediate blessing having reference to the additional sacrifice prescribed for the New Moons, and concludes it with the formula, ""Who sanctifiest Israel and the new moons."""
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.11","11. On a Sabbath that is also an intermediate day of a festival, and likewise when the beginning of the month falls on a Sabbath, the evening, morning and afternoon services consist of the seven blessings, as on other Sabbaths—with the prayer, ""O, our God and God of our fathers, let our remembrance arise and come, etc."" added in the blessing referring to the restoration of the ancient service. In the additional service, the intermediate blessing begins and ends with a reference to the Sabbath while the middle portion refers to the special sacred character of the day. On new moons it concludes, ""Who sanctifiest the sabbath, Israel and the beginning of the months,"" and on the intermediate days of the festivals, the conclusion is the same as on a festival that falls on the sabbath. When a festival falls on the first day of the week, the following paragraph is inserted, in the evening service, in the fourth blessing:"
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.12","12. ""Thou hast made known unto us the judgments of Thy righteousness, and hast taught us to perform the statutes of Thy will. Thou hast given us, O Lord our God, the holiness of the Sabbath and the glory of the appointed time, and the celebration of the festival. Thou hast made a distinction between the holiness of the Sabbath and that of the feast, and hast hallowed the great and holy seventh day. Thou hast given us, O Lord our God, appointed times for gladness and seasons for joy,…"" At the close of the Sabbath or festivals throughout the year, the <i>Habdalah</i> (paragraph referring to the distinction between the profane and holy), is recited in the fourth blessing, ""Thou favourest man with knowledge …"", although the <i>Habdalah</i> is afterwards also said over the cup of wine."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.13","13. During the Feast of Lights and on the Feast of Lots, the paragraph beginning, ""For the miracles"" is added in the blessing beginning, ""We give thanks unto Thee."" On the Sabbath during the Feast of Lights the paragraph, ""For the miracles"" is recited in the Additional Services as it is in the other services."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.14","14. On fast days, every one who fasts adds, in the blessing concluding, ""Who hearkenest unto prayer,"" the paragraph beginning, ""Answer us etc."" The reader of the congregation, when repeating the service aloud, recites this paragraph as an independent blessing, between the blessing relating to redemption and that relating to health; and concludes it with the formula, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who answerest in time of trouble."" And so on that day the reader recites twenty blessings. On the ninth of Ab, a paragraph is added in the blessing concluding, ""Who rebuildest Jerusalem,"" as follows: Have mercy, O Lord our God, upon us and upon Israel, Thy people, and upon the city that is ruined and desolate …"""
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.15","15. During the winter, the phrase, ""Who causeth the rain to fall,"" is inserted in the Second blessing, while in summer the phrase, ""Who causeth the dew to descend"" is recited. The formula, ""Who causeth the rain to fall"" is first said in the Additional service of the last (eighth) day of the feast of Tabernacles and continues to be said till the morning service on the first day of Passover. And the formula, ""Who causeth the dew to fall"" is begun in the additional service of the first day of Passover."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.16","16. Beginning with the seventh day of Marheshvan, a petition for Rain is included in the blessing calling for prosperity during the year, and is recited as long as the reference to rain, inserted in the second blessing, continues to be said. This is the rule for the Holy Land. But in Shinar (now called Iraq), Syria, Egypt, and adjacent territories, as well as in other places similar to these (in climate) the petition for Rain is begun sixty days after the autumnal equinox."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.17","17. In places that require rain in the summer, for instance in the distant sea-girt islands, a petition for rain, is offered up, whenever it is needed, in the prayer ending, ""Who hearkenest unto prayer."" In places where the second days of the feasts are kept, the formula, ""Who causest the rain to descend"" is recited, for the first time in the year, in the additional Service, on the first day of the feast of Solemn Assembly (8th day of Tabernacles) and continues to be recited throughout the winter."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.18","18. The third blessing ends, throughout the year, with the words, ""the holy God,"" and the eleventh blessing, with the words, ""King who loveth righteousness and justice."" But in the ten days, from the New Year to the close of the day of Atonement, the third blessing ends with the words, ""the holy King"" and the eleventh, with the words, ""The King of Justice."""
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.2.19","19. In some places it is customary, during these ten days, to add in the first blessing the petition, ""Remember us unto life, …"", in the second blessing, the sentence, ""Who is like unto Thee, O merciful father …"", (in the Thanksgiving blessing, ""Remember Thy mercies …"")<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*In the German and Polish ritual, ""Inscribe in the book of life, all the sons of Thy Covenant.""</i> and in the last blessing, ""In the book of life …"" So too, in some places they have the custom, during these ten days, to add in the third blessing the paragraphs, ""And thus cause the fear of Thee, O Lord our God …"" On the New Year and the Day of Atonement, the addition of these paragraphs to the third blessing is the general practice."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.3.1","1. In order that the duty may be properly fulfilled, the morning service should begin at sunrise. It may however be recited till the close of the fourth hour after dawn, that is, till the lapse of one third of the day. And if one transgressed, wittingly or in error, and recited the Service after the fourth hour, and before noon, he has fulfilled the duty of reciting the prayer, but not that of reciting it at the right time. For even as prayer is a precept of the Torah, so it is an ordinance of our teachers to offer it at the proper time, as appointed by the sages and prophets."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.3.2","2. We have already stated that the time for reciting the afternoon service was fixed to correspond with the hour when the daily afternoon sacrifice was offered up. As this took place daily nine and a half hours after dawn, the time for reading the afternoon service was appointed to begin nine and a half hours after dawn. This is termed the Minor Afternoon (Service). And since the daily [afternoon] sacrifice was slaughtered six and a half hours after dawn on the Eve of Passover, whenever that date fell on the eve of the Sabbath, the Sages declared that if one recites the afternoon service later than six and a half hours after dawn, he has fulfilled his duty. The arrival of this hour marks the time when the obligation to read the afternoon service has commenced. This is termed the Major Afternoon (Service)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.3.3","3. Many have the custom of reciting both the major and minor afternoon services, one of them as an optional service. Some of the Geonim<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**The Geonim were heads of religious academies in Babylon.</i> decided that only the major afternoon service may be thus recited. And this is in accordance with reason; for it corresponds to the fact that the offering of the daily afternoon Sacrifice at that hour did not take place regularly, every day.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*But only when the Eve of Passover fell on the sixth day of the week.</i> Still, if the major afternoon service had been recited as the obligatory service, the minor afternoon service should only be recited as an optional service."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.3.4","4. Hence, the time for reciting the major afternoon service begins six and a half hours (after dawn) and continues till nine and a half hours (after that time), while the time for the minor afternoon service begins from nine and a half hours and continues till one and a quarter hours before the close of day. The prayer should however be recited before sunset."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.3.5","5. The time for reciting the additional service begins after the morning service and continues till the seventh hour of the day. One who recites it after the seventh hour, although he has transgressed (the rule as to the hour), has nevertheless fulfilled his duty, since the time for reciting it is the whole day."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.3.6","6. The time for the evening service, though it is not obligatory, is, for the one who reads it, from the commencement of nightfall till dawn. The <i>Neilah</i><sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**Concluding Service on the Day of Atonement and, in earlier times, on any public fast-day.</i> should be read at a time to allow it to be completed near sunset."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.3.7","7. One who recites a service, before the time appointed, has not fulfilled his duty and has to recite it again at the right time. But, if a person, on an urgent occasion, has recited the morning service after dawn (but before sunrise) he has fulfilled his duty. The evening service for the Sabbath Eve should be recited on the Eve of the Sabbath, before sunset. So the evening service for the close of the sabbath may be recited on the sabbath; the reason being that as the evening service is optional, one need not be strict as to the time of its recital; provided that the <i>Shema</i> is read at the proper time after the stars are visible."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.3.8","8. If the proper time of a service has passed without its having been recited, the omission, if wilful, cannot be rectified or made good. But if the omission was due to error or preoccupation, it can be made good at the next service. The latter is first recited at its proper time, and the prayer is then repeated to make good the omission."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.3.9","9. For example: If by mistake, one omitted to read the prayer in the morning and the first half of the day passed, he should read the prayer in the afternoon twice; first to fulfill the duty of reading the afternoon service, and a second time, to make good the omission of the morning service. If through error, the afternoon service had been omitted and the sun had set, the prayer in the evening should be read twice; the first time, as the evening service, and again, to make up for the omission of the afternoon service. If, by error, the evening service has not been read, and it has dawned, the morning prayer should be read twice, the first time, as the morning service, the second, to make up for the omission of the previous evening service."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.3.10","10. If two successive services had erroneously been omitted, only the latter can be made good. For example, if, by error, one recited neither the morning nor the afternoon services, he is to read the evening prayer twice; the first time as the evening service, the second to make up for the omission of the afternoon service. But the omission of the morning service cannot be made good, the time for that having passed. The same applies to other services."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.3.11","11. If one has two services to read, that of the afternoon and the additional service, the afternoon service should be read first and then the additional service. One authority decides that this should not be done in congregational worship, lest the people be misled (as to the normal order of the Services)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.1","1. There are five requisites, the absence of which hinder the [proper] recital of a Service, even when its due time has arrived;—Cleansing the hands, Covering the body, Assurance as to the cleanliness of the place where the prayers are recited, Removal of distractions, and Concentration of the mind."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.2","2. Cleanliness of hands: How is this condition complied with? The hands are washed in water, up to the wrists, and then the prayers are recited. A person, travelling on the road, finds, when the time for prayer has arrived, that he has no water. If it can be procured within a distance of four miles, equal to 8000 cubits, he should proceed to the locality where there is water, wash his hands and then recite the prayers. If the distance exceeds that limit, he wipes his hands on a clod, or with loose earth, or on a beam and then reads the Service."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.3","3. This rule only applies if the direction of the place where water can be procured is in front of the traveller. But if it is in his rear, he is only obliged to retrace his steps a mile. If he has passed on from the place where there is water beyond this distance, he is not obliged to go back, but wipes his hands and recites the prayers. The statement that for prayers only the hands need to be cleansed refers to all services except the morning service. For this service, the face, the hands and the feet<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Why feet? Because these may be mired as people walked barefoot or only wearing sandals.</i> should first be washed, and then the prayers are recited. If water is not accessible, one wipes the hands only, and recites the prayers."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.4","4. Those who are ritually unclean wash their hands only—like those that are clean—and recite the prayers. Although they are able to take a ritual bath and so be rid of their ritual impurity, their omission to do so does not debar them from the recital of the prayers. We have already explained that Ezra instituted the rule that one who had had an emission should not read Torah alone till he had taken a ritual bath. Subsequent authorities extended the rule to the recital of prayers, and ordained that such a person should not recite the prayers alone till he had ritually bathed. This rule has no connection with ritual cleanliness or uncleanliness. Its purpose is to restrain scholars from uxoriousness. Hence the limitation of the requirement of ritual bathing to those who had seminal emissions and whose case forms an exception to those otherwise unclean."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.5","5. While this ordinance was in force it was held that even one who suffered from flux and had a seminal issue, or a woman who in her period of menstration had a seminal discharge, or during cohabitation, found that her period of separation had come, must, in order to read the <i>Shema</i> and the prayers, first take a ritual bath on account of the seminal emission, even though they are also otherwise unclean. This is logical, the ritual bathing being prescribed not because of the uncleanness, but to discourage uxoriousness. The ordinance, however, has become obsolete, as it was never universally adopted by the Jewish people and was found too irksome."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.6","6. The custom is general in Spain and in Shinar (Iraq) that one who has had a seminal emission does not recite prayers till he has washed all his body in water, out of respect to the exhortation, ""Prepare to meet thy God."" This only applies to a healthy person or one who is sick and has cohabited. But a sick man who has had an involuntary emission is exempt from the duty of bathing for prayer. The custom does not apply to his case, nor to the case of one who suffers from a flux or of a woman in her period of separation who had a seminal emission. They dry themselves, wash their hands and recite the prayers."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.7","7. The covering of the body: how is this requirement to be fulfilled? Although the lower part of the body is covered, as for the reading of the <i>Shema,</i> the prayers are not to be recited till the heart is also covered. If one has not covered it or is unable to do so, having nothing wherewith to cover it, and recites the prayers, he has fulfilled his duty, since the lower part of his body is covered. But he should not do so deliberately."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.8","8. Cleanliness of the place where prayers are recited: how is this condition fulfilled? One may not pray in a place where there is filth, nor in a bath-house, nor in a latrine, nor on a site used for depositing refuse, nor in any place concerning which there is no presumption that it is clean. In short, wherever the <i>Shema</i> is not read, there prayers are not recited. And as we move away from ordure, urine, a foul odor, a corpse, and an indecent exposure, in order that we may read the <i>Shema,</i> we do the same, for the recital of the prayers."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.9","9. A person who, after reciting prayers, finds ordure in the place, inasmuch as he had committed a sin in not examining it before his recital of the prayers, must read them again in a clean place. A person, while standing and reading the service, finds ordure in front of him. If by walking on, he would leave it four cubits in his rear, he should do so. If this is impossible,<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*A river or other barrier being in front of him.</i> he should move away from it sideways. If he cannot do this, he must intermit the recital of the prayers. The great sages did not recite prayers in a house where there was beer or strong sauce that had turned bad, because of its offensive odor, even though the premises might otherwise be clean."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.10","10. [Absence of] disturbing elements. How is this requisite fulfilled? If one feels an urgent call of nature, one must not pray. If the call is disregarded, the prayer that one utters is an abomination. And, having first relieved himself, he should recite the Service a second time. But if he can restrain himself as long as it would take to walk a <i>Parsah</i> (= 4 mil = 8000 cubits), his recital of prayer is accounted a proper recital. Nevertheless, prayers should not be recited by anyone till he has examined himself well and is satisfied that the calls of nature have been attended to. So also, phlegm, saliva and anything else that might disturb one should be removed and then the prayers should be recited."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.11","11. A person who, during prayers, stretches himself, yawns or sneezes, if he does so voluntarily, his behavior is unseemly. But if, before beginning his prayers, he examined himself and the act was involuntary, it does not matter. Saliva that has accumulated during prayer, should be covered with the garment. A person, whose delicacy would be offended by this procedure, casts it behind him with his hand, so that during prayer he may be saved from an annoyance which would disturb him. If, while standing in prayer, intestinal flatus involuntarily escapes, he waits till it has passed and resumes his prayer."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.12","12. If he is seized with intestinal flatulence, and its retention causes him excessive pain, he should step backwards four cubits and wait till he feels relieved. Then he should say: ""Lord of the Universe, Thou hast formed us with apertures and cavities. Our shame and reproach are open and known to Thee. Objects of shame and reproach are we while we live; worm and corruption, after we die."" Then he returns to his place and resumes his prayer."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.13","13. If, while standing reading the service, his urine dripped on to his knees, he should pause till the dripping has ceased, and then resume his prayers at the place where he left off. If he had paused for an interval sufficiently lengthy to conclude the service, he starts again from the beginning."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.14","14. So, after urinating, one must pause for as long as it would take to walk four cubits and then one may recite the service. Thus too, after the conclusion of a service, one should wait as long as it would take to walk four cubits before urinating, so that there shall be an interval after the reading of the service."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.15","15. Concentration of the mind—how is this condition [to be fulfilled?] Any prayer uttered without mental concentration is not prayer. If a service has been recited without such concentration, it must be recited again devoutly. A person finds that his thoughts are confused and his mind is distracted: He may not pray till he has recovered his mental composure. Hence, on returning from a journey or if one is weary or distressed, it is forbidden to pray till his mind is composed. The sages said that he should wait three days till he is rested and his mind is calm, and then he recites the prayers."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.16","16. What is to be understood by concentration of the mind? The mind should be freed from all extraneous thoughts and the one who prays should realize that he is standing before the Divine Presence. He should therefore sit awhile before beginning his prayers, so as to concentrate his mind, and then pray in gentle tones, beseechingly, and not regard the service as a burden which he is carrying and which he will cast off and proceed on his way. He should, accordingly, also sit awhile, after concluding the prayers, and then leave. The ancient saints were wont to pause and meditate one hour before the service, one hour after the service and take one hour in its recital."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.17","17. An intoxicated person must not pray, because he cannot concentrate. If he prays, his prayer is an abomination. He must therefore recite the prayers again after he has recovered from his intoxication. A person under the influence of drink should not pray while in that condition. But if he has recited the service, it is regarded as prayer. A drunkard is one who is unable to speak in the royal presence. A person under the influence of drink is one who can speak in the presence of a king without committing error. Yet having drunk, if only a quarter of a <i>log</i> of wine,<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Equal in volume to 1½ eggs.</i> one is not to pray till he is rid of the effect of the wine he has taken."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.18","18. So too, persons should not stand up to pray after indulging in jest, laughter, frivolity, idle talk, quarrelling or outburst of anger, but only after the study of Torah, not however of legal discussions by which the mind is distracted, but only after the study of such themes as require no profound reflection, as for instance established rules."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.19","19. Prayers which are only read at periodic intervals, such as the additional service for the beginning of the month and the services for the festivals should be first rehearsed before one stands up to recite them so that he shall not break down during their recital."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.4.20","20. If a person were travelling in a dangerous locality, infested, for example, by wild beasts or robbers, he should recite one blessing as follows: ""The needs of Israel, Thy people, are many. Their knowledge is scanty. Be it Thy will, O Lord, our God, to give every one what is sufficient for his maintenance and provide every creature with its requirements. Do what is good in Thy sight. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who hearkenest unto prayer."" He recites this prayer, walking. If he is able to stand on one spot while uttering it, he should do so. And when he arrives in a neighbourhood that is populated and his mind is calm, he reads the service of nineteen blessings in its regular form."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.1","1. In reciting prayers, eight points should be heeded and observed. If, however, these were disregarded, owing to stress, or disability or even wilfully, the recital of the prayers would not be debarred [deemed ineffective]. The points are as follows: one should stand; with face towards the Temple; the body should be in correct posture; the clothing adjusted; one should stand in a proper place; the voice should be properly modulated; and genuflection and prostration be correctly performed."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.2","2. <i>The Standing position.</i> The <i>Amidah</i> [main prayer] is only recited, standing. A person who is on a ship or in a waggon should, if he is able, stand up for that prayer. If unable, he may read it, sitting in his place. A sick person may read it, even lying down on his side, provided, however, that he can concentrate his mind. A thirsty or hungry person is in the same category as the sick: if he can concentrate, he recites the prayer; if not, he should not do so till he has refreshed himself with food and drink. A person who is riding, need not alight, even if there is some one to hold his beast so that his mind may be at ease."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.3","3. <i>With face turned towards the Temple.</i> Anyone outside Palestine turns his face towards the land of Israel and recites the prayer. One who is in the Holy Land turns towards Jerusalem. One who is in Jerusalem turns towards the Temple. If one is in the Temple, he turns towards the Holy of Holies. A person who is either blind, or unable to determine the right direction, or is on a ship, directs his heart to the Divine Presence and prays."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.4","4. <i>Correct posture.</i> When standing in prayer, the feet should be in line; the eyes lowered as if one were looking towards the ground; while the heart should be uplifted as if one were in heaven; the hands should be placed over the heart, close together, the right over the left. The worshipper should stand, like a servant in his master's presence, in awe, fear and dread. He should not place his hands on his hips."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.5","5. <i>Adjustment of the dress.</i> Before beginning the Service, the dress should first be adjusted and the personal appearance made trim and neat, as it is said, ""O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness"" (Psalms 96:9). One should not stand in prayer wearing a moneybelt, nor bareheaded, nor barefoot, where the local custom is not to stand in the presence of the great, without shoes. And one should not pray anywhere, holding phylacteries in the hand or carrying a scroll of the law in the arms, for the mind would then be preoccupied with those sacred objects. Nor while praying, should vessels or money be held in the hand. On the feast of Tabernacles, however, the worshiper prays, while carrying a palm branch—this being the religious duty of the day. When the time comes to recite the prayer, a person carrying a burden on his head, adjusts it behind him, if it is less than four kabs<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*A kab is equal in volume to 4 logs. A log is equal in volume to 6 hen's eggs.</i> and recites the prayer. If it is four kabs in size, he places it on the ground, and then prays. The practice of all the sages and their disciples is not to pray unless their heads are wrapped in the <i>Talith</i> (praying shawl)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.6","6. <i>Place where the worshiper prays.</i> He should stand in a low place and turn his face to the wall. Windows or doors towards Jerusalem should be opened, and he should stand facing them when he prays, as it is said, ""Now his windows were open in his upper chamber towards Jerusalem"" (Daniel 6:11). There should be one fixed place set apart for prayer. It should not be recited in a ruin nor at the rear of a synagogue, unless the worshiper turns his face towards the synagogue. It is forbidden to remain seated at the side of one who is standing in prayer, or pass in front of him unless he has moved away from the worshiper to a distance of four cubits."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.7","7. One must not, while praying, stand on a spot three hand-breadths or more above the floor of the room; nor may one stand for prayer upon a bed, stool or chair. A lofty structure, provided that it is four cubits by four cubits in area—the size of a chamber—is regarded as an attic, and it is permitted to pray in it. So, too, if it was enclosed on all sides by partitions, even though its area was less than four cubits by four cubits, prayers may be recited while standing in it, for the height of such a structure is not noticed, it being a compartment by itself."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.8","8. Labourers who are working on the top of a wall, or on the top of a tree, when the time for prayer arrives, should descend to the ground, recite the prayer, and resume their labours. If they are on the top of an olive tree or a fig tree, they recite it where they are, as it would entail excessive trouble to descend. What prayer do they recite? Those who work for board only recite the three daily prayers, of nineteen blessings each. If they were working for wages, they recite <i>Havinenu</i> [Summary of the Middle Blessings, together with the first three and last three blessings]. In either case, no congregational service is held, nor is the priestly benediction pronounced."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.9","9. <i>Modulation of the voice.</i> The voice should not be raised during the recital of the <i>Amidah</i> prayer nor should it be offered [silently] in thought alone. The words should be pronounced with the lips, but softly, and yet be audible to the speaker's ears. The worshiper should not permit his voice to be heard by others, unless he is sick, or is unable to concentrate his attention without reading aloud. He may not, however, do so at public worship, so that the congregants shall not be disturbed by his loud praying."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.10","10. <i>Genuflection.</i> The worshiper bends the knees five times in every [<i>Amidah</i>] prayer,<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**Prayer, recited standing.</i> at the beginning and at the end of the first blessing; at the beginning and the end of the thanksgiving blessing (which begins ""We thank Thee""); and after the conclusion of the prayer. The knees are then bent, the worshiper steps backwards three paces, and with knees bent, bows to the left, then to the right, and then raises his head."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.11","When he bends the knees the first four times, he does so while uttering the word ""Blessed"" and resumes the erect posture at the word ""O Lord."" This rule applies to the layman. The high priest however bends the knees at the beginning and end of every blessing. The king bows his head at the beginning of the [<i>Amidah</i>] prayer and does not raise it till he has concluded it."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.12","11. Why does the worshiper bow towards the left, first? Because his left corresponds to the right of the person whom he faces. And just as one who stands before a king bows to the king's right and then to the king's left, so the sages ordained that at the conclusion of the <i>Amidah</i>, the same etiquette should be observed as in taking leave of the royal presence."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.13","12. In all these genuflections, the worshiper should bow till all the vertebrae of the spinal column become prominent, and his body assumes the shape of a bow. If however he bowed slightly and made an effort which caused strain, so that it is evident that he bows as low as he can, he need not be apprehensive [as to whether he had fulfilled his duty]."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.14","13. <i>Prostration.</i> After he has raised his head, subsequent to the fifth genuflection, the worshiper seats himself on the floor and ""falls upon his face"" and offers all the supplications he pleases. Genuflection, wherever mentioned, always refers to bending the knees. <i>Kidah</i> means ""falling on the face"" [with knees bent]. <i>Hishtahvayah</i> means stretching out the hands and feet, so that one is lying prone with face to the ground."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.15","14. When performing the rite of ""falling on the face"", after the service, some fall on the face, some prostrate themselves. The latter is forbidden on a stone floor, except in the Temple of Jerusalem, as has been explained in the laws concerning Idolatry. [Even] a worthy person may not fall on his face unless he is conscious that he is a righteous man like Joshua.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*(Joshua 5:14) ""And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship.""</i> He should only incline his face somewhat, but not press it against the floor. It is permissible to recite the service of prayer in one spot and ""fall upon the face"" elsewhere."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.5.16","15. It is a rule universally observed in Israel, that the rite of ""falling upon the face"" is not practised on Sabbaths, Festivals, the New Year, the New Moon, Feast of Lights, Feast of Lots, at the afternoon services on the eves of Sabbaths and Festivals, or in the evening service any day. Some individuals fall on their faces in the evening service. All do so in every service on the day of Atonement, this being a day of petition, supplication, and fasting."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.6.1","1. A person is forbidden to pass at the rear of a Synagogue while public worship is proceeding, unless he is carrying a burden, or the Synagogue has two entrances on two sides, when an observer could say, ""Possibly, he will enter at the other door."" So too, if there are two Synagogues in a city, an observer could say, ""Possibly the passer-by is proceeding to the place of worship he usually attends."" If he has phylacteries on his head, he is permitted to pass by, even in the absence of these circumstances; for the phylacteries indicate that he is eager to perform religious duties and does not belong to those who neglect the duty of prayer."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.6.2","2. One who recites his prayers with a congregation should not unduly protract its recital. But when one is alone, it is left to his discretion. If, after the <i>Amidah</i> prayer, he wishes to continue with supplications even to the length of the Confessional ritual for the day of Atonement, he may do so. Or if he desires to introduce in each of the intermediate blessings an addition appropriate to any of the blessings he may do so."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.6.3","3. For instance: If there is a sick person about whom he is concerned, he interpolates in the blessing relating to the sick, in accordance with his ability, a petition for divine mercy to be vouchsafed to the patient. If he needs a livelihood, he interpolates a special supplication in the blessing praying for a prosperous year. In the same way, he may make additions in every one of the blessings. Or if he wishes to include petitions for all his needs in the blessing which ends with the phrase, ""Who hearkeneth unto prayer"", he may do so. But no petition may be inserted in the first three or in the last three blessings."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.6.4","4. It is forbidden to take any refreshment or do any work after daybreak, till the morning service has been recited. Nor should a visit be paid, early in the morning, to a neighbour's home, to greet him, before the morning service has been recited. Nor should one set out on a journey before praying. But refreshment may be taken before reciting the additional service or the afternoon service. A meal however must not be taken, close to the hour for reading the afternoon service."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.6.5","5. When the major afternoon has arrived (half an hour after midday), one must not repair to the bathing establishment—even only to perspire—till he has first read the [afternoon] service, lest he faint and omit the prayer. Nor may one sit down even to a casual meal, lest he linger over it. Nor proceed to the trial of a case, even towards its conclusion, lest the pleas may be upset and the proceedings be prolonged and so the service of prayer be omitted. Nor may one sit down in a barber's shop to have the hair cut till he has recited the service, lest the scissors become broken (and delay would ensue). Nor should one enter a tannery near the afternoon, till he has first prayed, lest, seeing his property spoiling, he may busy himself therewith and be prevented reciting the service. If however he has begun any of the foregoing, he does not stop but concludes what he is engaged in, and then recites the afternoon service."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.6.6","6. When is the cutting of the hair regarded as having begun? When the barber lays the barber's sheet upon the customer's knees. When is bathing regarded as having begun? When the bather removes the garment next to his skin. When is one regarded as having begun to tan? When he fastens over his shoulders the apron as the workmen do. When is a meal considered to have begun? In Palestine, when the hands have been washed; in Babylon, when the girdle has been loosened. When is a trial regarded as having begun? When the judges are robed, each of them in a Talith (Praying shawl) and have taken their seats. If they are already seated, when the litigants have opened their pleading."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.6.7","7. Although the evening service is optional, a man, coming home from his work, should not say, ""I will eat a little and sleep a little and then recite the prayers"", lest he be overcome by sleep and continue to sleep throughout the night. He should first read the evening service and then eat and drink or sleep."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.6.8","It is permitted to have one's hair cut or go into a bathing establishment near the time for the morning service, as the prohibition only applies to the afternoon when it is a usual procedure for most people to enter bathing establishments or have their hair cut during the day. But in the early morning this is unusual and was not prohibited."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.6.9","8. If one was occupied with the study of the Torah, he intermits his studies when the time for prayer arrives and recites the service. If study was his profession and he does no other work, he does not stop learning if he is engaged in it at the time of prayer; for the duty of studying Torah is more important than that of reciting prayer. One who occupies himself with the needs of the community is in the same class with one who is occupied with the study of the Torah."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.6.10","9. A person who is praying must not break off his prayer, except only if he is in mortal danger. Even when a king who is an Israelite greets him, he must not return the greeting. But if the king is an idolater, he stops, lest the king puts him to death. If, while standing and praying, he sees a king who is an idolater or a man of violence coming towards him, he should shorten the prayer. If unable to do so, he should stop praying. So too, if he sees snakes and scorpions, whose sting in that locality is deadly, moving in his direction, he stops his prayers as soon as they get near him and escapes. But if their sting is not deadly, he does not intermit his prayers."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.6.11","10. Women, slaves and children are under an obligation to recite the prayers. Every person exempt from reading the <i>Shema</i> is exempt from reciting the prayers. All those who follow a funeral, although they are not needed to carry the bier, are, for the time being, exempt from reading the prayers."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.1","1. When the sages instituted these services of prayer, they likewise instituted other blessings, to be recited daily. These are as follows: When about to retire to rest for the night, one recites the blessing, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, king of the Universe, who causest the bands of sleep to fall upon my eyes and givest light to the pupil of the eye. May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, to deliver me from the evil inclination and from mishap. Let not evil dreams nor evil imaginations trouble me. May my rest be perfect before Thee. Cause me to rise from it to life and to peace, and lighten mine eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who givest light to the whole world in Thy glory."""
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.2","2. He then reads the first section of the <i>Shema</i> and sleeps. If he is overcome by drowsiness, he reads even if it be only one verse [of the <i>Shema</i>] or verses of a supplicatory character and sleeps."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.3","3. When he awakes, after he has completed his rest, he recites, while still on his couch, the following blessing: ""O my God, the soul that Thou gavest me is pure. Thou didst create it, Thou didst form it, Thou didst breathe it into me, Thou preservest it within me, Thou wilt take it from me and wilt restore it unto me hereafter. So long as the soul is joined within me, I give thanks unto Thee, O Lord my God, Sovereign of all works. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who restorest souls unto dead bodies."""
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.4","4. When he hears the crowing of the cock, he recites the blessing, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*This sentence ""Blessed … Universe"" precedes every one of the following blessings.</i>, who hast given to the cock intelligence to distinguish between day and night."" When he puts on his garments, he recites, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who clothest the naked."" When he puts on his headgear he recites, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who crownest Israel with glory."" When he passes his hands over his eyes, he recites, ""Who openest the eyes of the blind."" When he sits up on his couch, he recites, ""Who loosest those that are bound."" When he descends from the couch and puts his feet on the ground, he recites, ""Who spreadest forth the earth above the waters"". When he stands up, he recites, ""Who raisest up them that are bowed down"". When he washes his hands, he recites, ""Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments and given us a command concerning the washing of the hands"". When he washes his face, he recites the blessing, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who removest the bands of sleep from mine eyes and slumber from mine eyelids. May it be Thy will, O Lord my God and God of my fathers to accustom me to religious duties and not accustom me to transgression. Let the good inclination have sway over me and let not the evil inclination have sway over me. Strengthen me in Thy commandments and grant my portion in Thy Law. Grant that I may be vouchsafed grace, loving kindness and mercy in Thy sight and in the sight of all who behold me, and bestow upon me loving kindnesses. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who bestowest loving kindnesses upon Thy people, Israel."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.5","5. When one goes to the toilet, he says before entering, ""Honoured be ye, O honoured and holy ones, ministers of the Supreme. Protect me, protect me; tarry for me when I enter and till I leave; for this is the way of the children of men"".<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*These sentences are no longer said.</i> After leaving, he recites the blessing, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast formed man in wisdom and created in him many orifices and vessels. If one of these should close<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**Contrary to their function.</i><sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**Contrary to their function.</i> or one of these open, it would be impossible to exist even for a single hour. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who healest all flesh and doest wondrously."""
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.6","6. When he fastens his girdle, he recites, ""Who girdest Israel with strength"". When he puts on his shoes, he recites, ""Who hast supplied my every want"". When he starts to go out, he recites, ""Who hast made firm the steps of man"". A male recites daily the following blessings, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast not made me a heathen""; ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast not made me a bondman""; ""Blessed art Thou O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast not made me a woman"".<sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">***A woman omits this blessing and substitutes as follows: ""… Who hast made me according to Thy will"".</i>"
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.7","7. These Eighteen blessings have no appointed order. Each blessing is recited at the appropriate time and occasion. For example: If one has put on his girdle, while still on his couch, he recites the blessing, ""Who girdeth Israel with strength"". When he hears the cock crow, he recites the blessing, ""Who hast given the cock intelligence, etc."". Any of the above blessings for which there is no occasion, is not recited."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.8","8. For example: If one passed the night without removing his clothes, on arising in the morning he does not recite the blessing, ""Who clothest the naked"". If one walks barefoot, he does not recite the blessing, ""Who hast supplied my every want"". On the Day of Atonement and on the Ninth of Ab, when there is no ablution, one does not recite the blessing, ""Concerning the washing of hands"", nor the blessing, ""Who removest the bands of sleep from mine eyes"".<sup>†</sup><i class=""footnote"">†Washing the eyes removes drowsiness.</i> If one has no occasion to visit the toilet, he does not recite the blessing, ""Who formest man, etc."". And so with the other blessings."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.9","9. The people in most of our cities have the custom of reciting these blessings in the Synagogue, consecutively, whether they were under an obligation to do so or not. This however is an erroneous practice which should not be followed. No blessing should be recited unless there is an obligation to do so."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.10","10. If one rises early to read the Torah, before he has recited the <i>Shema,</i> whether it is the Written or the Oral Law that he intends to study, he first washes his hands, recites three blessings and then proceeds to his reading. The blessings are as follows: ""Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments and given us a command concerning the words of the Law. Make pleasant, we beseech Thee, O Lord our God, the words of Thy Law in our mouth and in the mouth of Thy people, all the house of Israel, so that we with our offspring and the offspring of Thy people all the house of Israel may know Thy name and learn Thy Law for its own sake. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who givest the Law. Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast chosen us from all nations and given us Thy Law. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who givest the Law."""
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.11","11. It is a duty to recite these three blessings daily and then read a small portion of the words of the Torah. The people have the custom to read the Priestly Benediction.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Numbers 6:24-26.</i> In some places the section referring to the Daily Sacrifices<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**Numbers 28:1-8.</i> is read. In others again, both these sections are read. Chapters or paragraphs from the <i>Mishna</i> or the <i>Boraitha</i> are also read."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.12","12. The early Sages lauded one who reads every day psalms from the Psalter, beginning with ""the Psalm of David"" (Psalm 145) and continuing till the end of the book. It is also settled practice to read verses before and after these Psalms. The Sages appointed a blessing to be recited before the psalms, the one beginning, ""Blessed be He who spake"", and a blessing to be recited after them, beginning, ""Praised be Thy name."" Then the blessings for the <i>Shema</i> are recited and the <i>Shema</i> is read."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.13","13. In some places, it is the custom, after the blessing beginning, ""Praised by Thy name,"" to read daily ""The Song of the Red Sea"" (Exodus 15:1-18), and then the blessings before the <i>Shema.</i> In other places, the custom is to read <i>Haazinu</i> (Deuteronomy Chapter 32.) Some individuals read both Songs. In this regard, custom always rules."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.14","14. A person is in duty bound to recite every complete day one hundred blessings. How are these hundred blessings made up? There are twenty-three blessing which we have enumerated in this chapter; and seven blessings before and after the morning and evening recital of the <i>Shema.</i> When putting on the <i>Zizith</i>,<sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">***Fringed garment (Numbers 15:37-41).</i> the blessing is recited, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to wear a fringed garment"". When putting on the <i>Tephillin</i> (phylacteries), the blessing is recited, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to lay the <i>Tephillin</i>"". All these, together with the three daily Services, each consisting of eighteen benedictions, make up eighty-six blessings. When two meals are taken each day, fourteen blessings are recited, seven at each meal, as follows; one blessing on washing the hands, one for the meal, three after its conclusion, one blessing before taking a drink and one after, making seven blessings for each meal."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.15","15. At the present time, since the institution of the blessing concerning Heretics as a part of the <i>Amidah</i> Service, and the addition of the blessing beginning, ""Who is good and Who doest good"" to the Grace after meals, there are five additional blessings (beyond the hundred). On Sabbaths and Festivals when the Amidah service consists of seven blessings, and on other days if one was not under the obligation to recite all these benedictions, as, for instance, if one did not sleep the whole night, did not loosen his girdle, or did not need to visit the toilet, and so forth, he has to complete the hundred blessings by partaking of fruit."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.16","16. How so? He partakes of a little vegetable, reciting the blessings before and after doing so; then a little of various kinds of fruit, reciting the appropriate blessings before and after each kind; and counts the blessings till the hundred, to be daily recited, are completed."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.17","17. The order of the prayers is as follows. In the morning, on arising, a person recites the blessings mentioned above; then reads the Psalms—reciting the appropriate blessings before and after them. Then he reads the <i>Shema,</i> reciting the blessings before and after it, omitting the <i>Kedusha</i><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Sanctification (Isaiah 6:3, Ezekiel 3.12).</i> from the former of the two blessings before the <i>Shema,</i> this not being recited by an individual in his private devotions. When he has concluded the blessing after the <i>Shema,</i> which closes with the phrase, ""Who redeemedst Isael"" he immediately rises, so that the reference to the Redemption may be connected with the <i>Amidah prayer,</i> which, as already stated by us, is recited standing. When this prayer is concluded, he sits down, bows his head, offers up supplications, raises his head and still seated, offers further supplications. Then he reads ""The Psalm of David"" (Psalm 145), offers according to his ability, more supplications, after which he proceeds to his affairs."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.18","18. The afternoon service begins with the reading of ""The Psalm of David"" (Psalm 145), the worshiper being seated. He then rises and recites the <i>Amidah</i> for the afternoon service. This concluded, he bows his head, offers supplications, raises his head, and offers further supplications according to his ability, and then proceeds to his affairs."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.7.19","19. In the evening service, the worshipper reads the <i>Shema,</i> reciting the appropriate blessings before and after it. The blessing referring to the redemption of Israel is connected with the <i>Amidah,</i> which is recited, standing. This concluded, the worshipper sits a brief while and withdraws. Whoever adds supplications after the <i>Amidah</i> in the evening acts commendably. Though the blessing concluded, ""Who redeemedst Israel"" is followed by the blessing beginning, ""Cause us to lie down"", this is not regarded as an interruption between the blessing relating to redemption and the <i>Amidah,</i> both blessings being regarded as one lengthy blessing."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.8.1","1. Congregational prayer is always heard [by the Almighty]. Even if there are sinners among them, the Holy One, blessed be He, does not reject the prayer of a multitude. Hence, a person should associate himself with the congregation, and never recite his prayers in private when he is able to pray with the congregation. One should always attend Synagogue, morning and evening; for only if recited in a synagogue, are one's prayers heard at all times. Whoever has a synagogue in his town and does not worship there is called a bad neighbour."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.8.2","2. It is a <i>Mitzvah</i> (praiseworthy duty) to proceed to the Synagogue at a quick pace, as it is said, ""And let us know; let us be eager to know the Lord"" (Hosea 6:3). When leaving the Synagogue, a person should not take big strides, but walk at a slow pace. On entering the Synagogue, one should move forward the distance [of the width] of two doors, and then recite his prayers, so as to fulfill the text, ""Waiting at the posts of my doors"" (Proverbs 8:34)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.8.3","3. A house of study is superior to a synagogue. Eminent sages, notwithstanding that there were many synagogues in their towns, only prayed in the places where they were engaged in the study of the Torah. It is understood that congregational services are [also] held there."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.8.4","4. How is public worship conducted? One person recites the prayers aloud, and all the rest listen. This is not done, if there are less than ten adult men present, the Reader being counted in the number. Even if some of them have already said their prayers and thus discharged their obligation, they help to complete the quorum of ten, provided that the majority have not yet said their prayers. So too, the <i>Kedushah</i><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Isaiah 6:3; Ezekiel 3:12; Psalms 146:10.</i> is not recited, nor is the Torah recited with the blessing before and after the reading, nor the lesson from the prophets read [with its blessings], unless a quorum of ten is present."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.8.5","5. Thus too, one individual is not to recite the blessings before the <i>Shema</i> while all listen and respond Amen, unless a quorum of ten is present. This is termed <i>Poress al Shema</i> (Cp. Targum to I Samuel 9:13). Nor is <i>Kaddish</i> recited, unless ten are present. Nor do the priests solemnly raise their hands (to recite the priestly benediction) unless ten are present, the priests being counted in the number. For every group of ten in Israel is called a Congregation, as it is said, ""How long shall I bear with this evil congregation"" (Numbers 14:27). Those alluded to here were ten, (the Spies)—Joshua and Caleb being excluded."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.8.6","6. Every procedure of a sacred character should only take place in a congregation of Israelites, as it is said; ""And I will be sanctified in the midst of the children of Israel"" (Leviticus 22:32). All the recitals, referred to above, if begun when a quorum of ten was present, of whom some left, though they are not authorized to do so, are concluded by those who remain."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.8.7","7. It is requisite that the congregation be assembled in one place and that the reader be with them in that place. Where a small court opens, throughout its complete breadth, to a larger courtyard, and nine persons are in the larger, while one person is in the smaller enclosure, they form a quorum. But if nine persons are in the smaller enclosure and one person is in the larger, they do not constitute a quorum. If the congregation is in the larger enclosure and the Reader in the smaller, their obligation to worship is discharged when he officiates on their behalf. But if the congregation is in the smaller, and the Reader in the larger enclosure, their obligation is not discharged when the reader recites the service, since he is separated from them and not in the same place with them, for the larger enclosure having posts on both sides is regarded as divided off from the smaller enclosure. The smaller enclosure, however, is regarded not as divided off from the larger enclosure, but as a corner of it."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.8.8","8. So too, if there is ordure in the larger enclosure, it is forbidden to recite prayers or read the <i>Shema</i> in the smaller enclosure. But if there was ordure in the smaller enclosure, prayers may be recited and the <i>Shema</i> may be read in the larger, provided that there was no offensive odor, since the smaller enclosure is divided off from the larger."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.8.9","9. The Reader discharges the obligation of the Congregation. How so? When he recites the prayers and they respond with the utterance of Amen after every blessing, they are regarded as praying. This only aplies to one who does not know the liturgy. One who is proficient does not discharge his obligation unless he recites the prayers for himself."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.8.10","10. The foregoing rule holds good for all days of the year except New Year's Day and the Day of Atonement in a Jubilee year. On those two days, the Reader discharges the obligations of the proficient as of the non-proficient, on the ground that the prayers recited on those days are lengthy and the majority of those acquainted with them cannot concentrate their minds as the Reader can. Hence, if one who is proficient wishes on those days to rely on the Reader's recital of the prayers, he may do so."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.8.11","11. None should be appointed as Reader to the Congregation unless he is reputed for his knowledge and exemplary conduct. If he is an old man, all the better. An endeavor should be made to secure one who has a pleasant voice and is accustomed to read. Anyone whose beard is not full grown, even though he is a great scholar, should, out of respect to the Congregation, not be appointed as the regular reader. But one may publicly recite the blessings before the <i>Shema,</i> as soon as the marks of puberty appear and one has passed the age of thirteen years."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.8.12","12. One whose enunciation is indistinct, who, for example, reads the <i>Aleph</i> as an <i>Ayin</i> or the <i>Ayin</i> as an <i>Aleph,</i> or cannot pronounce the letters correctly, is not to be appointed as Congregational reader. A teacher may appoint one of his pupils to read the services in his presence."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.8.13","13. A blind man may publicly recite the blessings before the <i>Shema</i> and be appointed Reader to the Congregation. But one whose shoulders are bare, though he may publicly recite the blessings before the <i>Shema,</i> does not recite the <i>Amidah</i> as Reader of the Congregation unless he is properly clad."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.1","1. The order of congregational services is as follows: At the morning services, the congregants are seated. The reader proceeds to the reading desk, begins with the recital of the <i>Kaddish.</i> All the people respond aloud as follows: ""Amen; may His great Name be blessed for ever and to all eternity"", and at the close of the <i>Kaddish</i> they again respond, ""Amen"". Then he says, ""Bless ye the Lord who is blessed""; they respond, ""Blessed be the Lord who is blessed for ever and ever"". He then starts to recite the <i>Shema</i> with the blessings preceding and following it. They respond, ""Amen"" at the close of each blessing. Any one, who is able, recites the blessings and reads the <i>Shema</i> at the same time as the reader till he has concluded the blessing after the <i>Shema,</i> which ends with the words, ""Who redeemed Israel""."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.2","2. All the worshipers immediately rise and recite the <i>Amidah</i> in a low tone. Whoever does not know the prayer stands silent while the reader and the congregation are praying inaudibly. As soon as a congregant has concluded the <i>Amidah,</i> he steps back three paces and remains standing there."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.3","3. After the reader has stepped back three paces he begins to recite the <i>Amidah</i> aloud from the beginning of the blessings; in order that anyone who has not recited the prayer shall be regarded as having discharged his obligation. All remain standing and listen and respond ""Amen"" after each blessing, those who have discharged their obligation by reciting the <i>Amidah,</i> as well as those who have not done so."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.4","4. He recites <i>Kedushah</i> in the third blessing. When the reader comes to the <i>Kedushah,</i> every one of the congregants may return to the place where he had stood while reciting the <i>Amidah.</i> When the reader reaches the blessing beginning, ""We thank Thee"" and bends his knee, all the congregants bow slightly, not however to excess, and recite, ""We give thanks unto Thee, O Lord our God and God of all flesh, our Creator, the Creator of all things in the beginning. Blessings and Thanksgivings be to Thy great and holy Name, because Thou hast kept us in life and hast preserved us. So mayest Thou continue to keep us in life and be gracious unto us. Gather our exiles to Thy holy courts, to observe Thy statutes, serve Thee in truth and do Thy will with a perfect heart, seeing that we give thanks unto Thee"". Any one who reiterates, ""We give thanks unto Thee; we give thanks unto Thee"" is silenced."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.5","5. After he has completed reciting the whole <i>Amidah,</i> he seats himself, bows his head, inclines slightly sideways; all the congregants doing the same. In this attitude, he offers up supplications. He then sits up and raises his head, the rest of the people doing the same; and, while seated, offers supplications aloud."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.6","6. The reader then rises alone and recites the <i>Kaddish</i> a second time, the Congregation making the responses as on the first occasion. He then recites, ""And He, being merciful, forgiveth iniquity, etc.,"" then, the Psalm of David—(Psalm 145). The reader in the meanwhile stands; the congregation remains seated and recites with him. He then recites, ""And a redeemer shall come unto Zion, etc. And as for me, this is my covenant, etc. But Thou art holy, etc. And one cried unto another, Holy, etc."" He completes the <i>Kedushah.</i> The congregants respond, ""Holy, holy, holy"" three times. He then reads the <i>Kedushah</i> in the Aramaic version. Then he recites the text, ""Then a wind lifted me up, etc."" He reads this also again in the Aramaic version. Then he recites, ""The Lord shall reign for ever and ever."" This he also repeats in Aramaic, so that the people may understand. These verses before and after the <i>Kedushah</i> together with their Aramaic versions are styled ""The order of Sanctification"". The reader then prays in supplicatory terms, reads verses of a supplicatory tenor, and recites <i>Kaddish</i> to which the people make the customary responses, and then they depart."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.7","7. Whoever says in his supplications, ""He that dealt mercifully with a nest of birds, forbidding the taking of the mother-bird together with the nestlings (Deuteronomy 22:6-7) and the slaughtering of a beast and its young in one day (Leviticus 22:28)—may He have mercy upon us"", or offers petitions of a similar character is silenced; for these precepts are divine decrees set forth in Scripture and have not been ordained in a spirit of compassion. Were this the motive, the slaughtering of all animals would have been prohibited. It is also forbidden to multiply epithets and say: ""O God, Great, Mighty, Awe-inspiring, Powerful, Puissant"", since it is beyond human power to exhaust the praises of God. One should therefore limit himself to the attributes used by Moses, our teacher, Peace be upon him."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.8","8. In the afternoon service, the Reader begins reading: ""And He, being merciful, forgiveth iniquity and destroyeth not; yea, many times He averteth His anger and awakeneth His wrath not at all"" (Psalm 38, verse 38),<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*This verse is not recited before the afternoon service but before the evening service both in the German and Spanish rituals.</i> and ""Happy are they that dwell in Thy house etc. A Psalm of David etc."" (Psalm 145). While reading this psalm, both he and the congregation are seated. The reader rises and says <i>Kaddish.</i> The congregants rise after him and make the customary responses. They all recite the <i>Amidah</i> inaudibly. The reader repeats the <i>Amidah</i> aloud, as in the morning service, till he has concluded the whole of it. All then bow their heads, offering supplications; raise their heads and continue their supplications remaining seated, as in the morning service. The reader then rises and recites <i>Kaddish.</i> The people make the customary responses. Then they depart to their affairs."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.9","9. In the evening service, all the congregants are seated. The reader rises and recites, ""And He, being merciful etc."", ""Bless ye the Lord, who is to be blessed"". They respond, ""Blessed is the Lord who is to be blessed for ever and ever"". He then begins to read the <i>Shema</i> with its accompanying blessings and says <i>Kaddish,</i> after which all rise and silently repeat the Amidah. When they have concluded, the reader says <i>Kaddish.</i> The congregation then departs. The reader does not, in the Evening Service, repeat the Amidah aloud, because that Service is not obligatory. He accordingly abstains from a recital of blessings that would be nugatory, since there is no one under an obligation to recite them, or would require the reader to discharge the duty for him."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.10","10. On the Eves of the Sabbaths, the Reader, after saying the <i>Amidah</i> silently with the Congregation, repeats it aloud. He does not however recite the Seven Blessings, but one blessing only, which summarizes the seven. The following is what he says:"
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.11","11. ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the great, mighty and revered God, the most high God, Possessor of Heaven and Earth. He with His word was a shield to our forefathers, and by His bidding, will quicken the dead; the holy God, like unto whom there is none; Who giveth rest to His people on His holy Sabbath day, because He took pleasure in them to grant them rest. Him we will serve in fear and with awe, and daily and constantly we will give thanks unto His name in the fitting form of blessings. He is the God to whom thanksgivings are due, the Lord of peace, Who halloweth the Sabbath and blesseth the Seventh Day, and in holiness giveth rest unto a people sated with delights, in remembrance of the Creation. Our God and God of our fathers, accept our rest etc. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who hallowest the Sabbath."" He then says <i>Kaddish,</i> after which all the people depart."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.12","12. The reason why the Sages instituted this particular repetition is because the majority of the people come on the Eves of Sabbaths to join in public worship, and there may be one present who came late and has not completed his prayer. He might be left alone in the synagogue and incur danger. The Reader therefore repeats a summary of the <i>Amidah,</i> so that all the congregation shall stay till the late comer shall have concluded and be able to leave with them.<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**In ancient times the Synagogues were outside the towns and villages. The evening prayer during the working days was recited by everyone at home. On Friday evening they repaired to the communal place of worship. It would have been dangerous for a late comer, left in the synagogue, to go home in the dark alone.</i>"
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.13","13. Hence, when a feast, the Day of Atonement or the First of the Month falls on a Sabbath, the reader who officiates does not include in this blessing any reference to the special day, but ends with the formula, ""Who hallowest the Sabbath,"" the reason being that the special day imposes no obligation to say this blessing."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.14","14. On sabbaths and festivals, after the Reader has completed the repetition of the morning <i>Amidah,</i> he says <i>Kaddish,</i> reads the 145th Psalm and again says <i>Kaddish,</i> after which the Congregation reads the additional service softly which he then recites aloud, as he did the [Amidah in the] morning service. He then says <i>Kaddish</i> after the additional service; and the people depart. Neither the ""Order of Sanctification""<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Beginning: ""And a Redeemer shall come to Zion … and Thou art holy.""</i> nor propitiatory prayers are then recited. They are recited before the afternoon service. Kaddish is then said. The <i>Amidah</i> for the afternoon is read by the Congregation and repeated aloud by the Reader who then says <i>Kaddish.</i>"
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.9.15","15. On the First Day of each month, and on the Intermediate Days of the Festivals, the ""Order of Sanctification"" is recited before the additional service. On the termination of the Sabbath, the Order of the Day (= Order of Sanctification) is recited after the evening service. Kaddish is then said and <i>Habdalah</i> (the group of blessings for the distinction between the holy [day] and the secular [days] is recited at the termination of Sabbaths and Festivals)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.1","1. If one has recited the <i>Amidah</i> without devotion, he should recite it again devoutly. If he, however, concentrated his attention during the recital of the first blessing, he need not read the prayer again. If one committed an error in one of the first three blessings, he has to turn back to the beginning of the <i>Amidah.</i> If he made a mistake in one of the last three blessings, he turns back to the blessing relating to the restoration of the Temple Service. If he made a mistake in one of the intermediate blessings, he turns back to the beginning of the blessing in which he made the mistake, and then continues the Service in regular order to the end. The reader, if he makes a mistake when reading the <i>Amidah</i> aloud, follows the same rules."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.2","2. But if the reader made a mistake while silently reading the <i>Amidah,</i> he does not, in my opinion, recite it silently a second time, so as not to incommode the congregation. He relies on his repetition of the <i>Amidah</i> which he will recite aloud. This is so if he had made no mistake in the first three blessings. If however the mistake was in one of these, he turns back to the beginning of the <i>Amidah,</i> like any layman."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.3","3. If a reader, having made a mistake, became confused and did not know where to resume, another person, after awhile takes his place. If he made a mistake in connection with the blessing concerning heretics, the congregation does not wait for him, but another person immediately takes his place, for possibly he may have become tainted with heresy. This rule holds good if he had not yet begun reciting this blessing. But if he had commenced it, the congregants wait for him awhile."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.4","4. The person asked to act as substitute should not decline. At which part of the <i>Amidah</i> does the substitute start? At the beginning of the blessing in which the first reader had made the mistake, provided that it had occurred in one of the intermediate blessings. If the mistake had been made in one of the first three blessings, the substitute starts at the beginning of the <i>Amidah.</i> If the mistake occurred in one of the last three blessings, the second reader begins with the blessing relating to the restoration of the ancient Temple service."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.5","5. If one says: I will not proceed to the reading desk as my garments are coloured, he is not permitted to act as reader in that service even when robed in white vestments. If one says: I will not proceed to the reading desk because I wear shoes, he does not act as reader even when he is barefoot."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.6","6. Whoever is uncertain whether he has or has not recited the <i>Amidah,</i> does not repeat it unless he has the intention of reciting it as a voluntary offering; for a private person may, if he wishes, recite the <i>Amidah</i> the whole day as a free will offering. If one, during his recital of the <i>Amidah,</i> recalled that he had already read it, he stops even in the middle of a blessing. This however is not the rule in regard to the Evening <i>Amidah</i> because, from the outset, he only recited it with the understanding that it was not obligatory."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.7","7. If one, in error, recited the week day <i>Amidah</i> on the Sabbath, he has not fulfilled his duty. If he realizes his mistake, while still engaged in the <i>Amidah,</i> he concludes the blessing which he has already begun and then recites the blessing appertaining to the Sabbath. This rule applies to the evening, morning and afternoon services. If the error occurred in the additional service, he stops even in the middle of a blessing. So it is also, if he concluded the Week day <i>Amidah,</i> under the impression that it was the additional service for the Sabbath, Festival or New Moon as the case may be."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.8","8. If one, in the winter, erroneously omitted both phrases, ""Who causeth the rain to descend"" and also ""Who causeth the dew to descend"", he should turn back to the beginning of the Amidah. If he recited the phrase referring to the dew, he does not turn back. If, in the summer, one said, in error, ""Who causeth the rain to descend"", he turns back to the beginning of the Amidah. If he omitted the phrase referring to the dew, he is not directed to read the <i>Amidah</i> again from the beginning, because the dew is never withheld and does not need a special petition."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.9","9. If one forgot to include the petition ""Give dew and rain"" in the blessing relating to prosperity for the year and became aware of his omission before reciting the blessing which concludes, ""Who heareth prayer"", he recites the petition for rain in the latter blessing. If he only became aware of the omission after reciting this blessing he turns back to the blessing relating to prosperity for the year. If he did not become aware of his omission till he had completed the entire <i>Amidah,</i> he turns back to the beginning and recites the whole of it a second time."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.10","10. If one made a mistake and did not recite the paragraph beginning, ""May our memorial ascend and come etc."" (specially recited on New Moons and festivals) and became aware of his omission before he had concluded the <i>Amidah,</i> he turns back to the blessing relating to the restoration of the Temple service and includes the paragraph omitted. If he became aware of his omission after he had concluded the <i>Amidah,</i> he turns back to its beginning. If he was wont to add propitiatory prayers after the <i>Amidah,</i> and became aware of his omission of them after he had completed the <i>Amidah</i> but before he had stepped back at its conclusion he turns back to the blessing relating to the restoration of the Temple service."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.11","11. These rules apply to the <i>Amidah</i> on the intermediate days of the festivals as well as the morning and afternoon <i>Amidah</i> of the New Moon. But if one did not recite this paragraph in the <i>Amidah</i> of the evening service of the New Moon, he does not turn back.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Because the Supreme Court did not fix the first day of the new month in the evening before that day but on the day itself.</i>"
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.12","12. In all cases where an individual praying for himself has to recite the <i>Amidah</i> a second time, the reader of the congregation does likewise, if he committed a similar error when reciting the <i>Amidah</i> aloud. The morning service on the first day of the month forms an exception. If on such a day, the reader forgot to recite the added passage beginning, ""May it ascend and come"", till he had concluded the <i>Amidah,</i> he is not to read it a second time, so as not to incommode the congregation. The reason is that he has still to read the additional service which contains a reference to the first day of the month."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.13","13. During the ten days from the New Year to the Day of Atonement, if, by mistake, one concluded the third blessing with the phrase, ""the holy God"" (instead of ""the holy King""), he turns back to the beginning of the <i>Amidah.</i> If by mistake, one concluded the eleventh blessing, ""King who loveth righteousness and judgment"" (instead of King of judgment) he turns back to the beginning of this blessing, and concludes it with the phrase ""King of judgment"". He then continues the service in the regular order. If he did not become aware of the error till he had concluded the entire <i>Amidah,</i> he turns back to its beginning. This rule applies to an individual praying for himself and to the Reader of the congregation reciting the <i>Amidah</i> aloud."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.14","14. If, in the fourth blessing ending, ""Who graciously grantest knowledge"", one has omitted,<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*After the close of Sabbath or Festival.</i> by error, the passage referring to the distinction between sacred and profane, he concludes the <i>Amidah</i> and is not bound to repeat it. So too, if one forgot on the Feast of Lights or on the Feast of Lots, to recite the passage beginning, ""For the miracles"", or, on a fast day, the prayer beginning, ""Answer us"", he does not recite the Amidah a second time. This rule applies to an individual praying privately and to the Reader of the congregation. If, [on a fast day] one becomes aware of the omission before he steps back at the conclusion of the <i>Amidah,</i> he says, ""Answer us, for Thou hearest prayer, delivering and saving us at all times of trouble and distress. May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before Thee, etc.""."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.15","15. One who forgot to recite the afternoon service on the eve of the Sabbath should recite the Sabbath <i>Amidah</i> for the Friday evening twice. There is a similar rule in the case of the eve of a festival. One who forgot to recite the afternoon service on a sabbath or festival, recites the <i>Amidah</i> in the evening service after the close of the festival twice—both <i>Amidahs</i> being those recited on a week day. The passage referring to the distinction between sacred and profane is included in the first, not in the second. If it was included in both or omitted from both, he has fulfilled his duty. But if it was omitted from the first recital and included in the second, he has to recite the <i>Amidah</i> a third time, the first recital not being counted, as it took place before the <i>Amidah</i> proper to the evening. When one recites two services, even the morning and additional services, one should not recite the second immediately after the first but pause between, so as to obtain a proper frame of mind."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.10.16","16. Whoever joins in public worship is forbidden to say his prayers in advance of the congregation. A person entering a synagogue and finding the congregation silently reciting the <i>Amidah</i> should also recite it, provided that he can begin and conclude it before the Reader, in his repetition, reaches the <i>Kedushah.</i> If he is unable to do so, he should wait till the Reader begins the repetition and then silently recite the <i>Amidah</i> with the Reader, word for word till the latter comes to the <i>Kedushah,</i> when he should join in the congregational responses to the <i>Kedushah</i> after which he recites the rest of the <i>Amidah</i> for himself. If he commenced the <i>Amidah</i> before the Reader began to recite it aloud, and the Reader reaches the <i>Kedushah,</i> he should neither stop nor utter the responses in the <i>Kedushah.</i> So too, he should not utter the response ""Amen. May His great name be blessed; and, needless to add, he should not do so if the Reader is reciting other blessings."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.1","1. Wherever there are ten Israelites resident, an edifice must be fitted up, where they can assemble for worship at each period of prayer. Such a building is termed a synagogue. The residents exercise compulsory powers on each other for the purpose of erecting a synagogue and purchasing a scroll of the Law (Pentateuch), the prophetical books and the Hagiography."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.2","2. When a synagogue is to be built, the highest part of the town should be selected for the site, as it is said, ""At the head of the noisy streets she [Wisdom] calleth"" (Proverbs 1:21). The building is to be raised sufficiently high to overtop all the other courtyards of the town, as it is said, ""To exalt the house of our God."" (Ezra 9:9). The doors of the Synagogue are to be made to open only on the East side, as it is said, ""And those who encamped before the Tabernacle eastwards"" (Numbers 3:38). Within, a shrine is built to contain a scroll of the Law. This shrine is erected on the side towards which the people in that town turn when praying, so that when they are standing engaged in prayer, they will face the shrine. In the centre of the building, a platform is erected, which the Reader of the lesson from the Pentateuch or whoever exhorts the people mounts, so that all the congregation may hear. The desk (<i>Tebah</i>) on which the scroll is placed (when reading the <i>Torah</i>) is set up in the centre,<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*In the centre of the platform.</i> its back towards the Shrine, its front facing the people."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.3","3. How are the people seated in synagogues? The elders sit facing the congregation with their backs to the Shrine. The people are seated in rows, one behind the other, the front of each row being at the rear of the one before it, so that all the people are facing the Shrine, the elders and the desk. When the reader stands up to recite the (<i>Amidah</i>) prayer, he stands on the floor before the <i>Tebah</i><sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**Elevated platform, with the desk on it for reading the Torah, rearward of him, the reader standing near to the Ark (Shrine).</i> and, like the rest of the congregation, his face is turned to the Shrine."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.4","4. Synagogues and houses of study must be treated with respect. They are swept and sprinkled to lay the dust. In Spain and the West (Morocco), in Babylon and in the Holy Land, it is customary to kindle lamps in the synagogues and to spread mats on the floor on which the worshippers sit. In the lands of Edom (Christian countries) they sit in synagogues on chairs [or benches]."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.5","5. There must be no light behaviour in synagogues and houses of study; no jesting, no mockery or idle talk. One may not eat or drink, indulge in physical recreation or promenade there. One may not enter, during the summer, to seek relief from the heat; or, in the winter, to obtain shelter from the rain."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.6","6. Nor are calculations to be made in them, unless these are in connection with a religious duty; for example, counting the contents of the charity box or the proceeds of a collection for redemption of captives etc. Funeral addresses are only delivered in them when these are of public interest, as for example for the great religious authorities of the city, which would be attended by the entire community."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.7","7. Where a synagogue or house of study has two doors, one may not use it as a passage, entering at one door and leaving by the other to shorten a journey, since it is forbidden to enter these buildings except to fulfill a religious duty."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.8","8. If one has occasion to go into a synagogue to call a child or other person, he may go in, but should read some portion of Scripture or recite a traditional dictum, so that his entry shall not be for the sake of his private affairs only. If he has no knowledge he should say to one of the children, ""Recite to me the verse which you are now reading"" or he should stay a while in the synagogue and then leave, for staying there is also a religious act, as it is said, ""Happy are they that dwell in Thy house"" (Psalms 84:5)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.9","9. One who entered a synagogue to pray or read Scripture may leave at the opposite door to that by which he entered, in order to take a short cut. A person may go into a synagogue with his staff, shoes, moneybelt and with dust on his feet. If he has need to do so, he may expectorate in the synagogue."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.10","10. Synagogues and houses of study that are in ruins retain their sacred character, as it is said, ""And I will desolate your sanctuaries"" (Leviticus 26:31)—even when desolate they still retain their sacred character. The same respect must be shown them when they are in ruins as when they were sound and in use. The only difference is in regard to sweeping and laying the dust. Synagogues in ruins are not swept nor sprinkled to lay the dust. If grass has sprung up in them, the blades are plucked and left there, so that the people may be stirred to rebuild the ruined edifices."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.11","11. A synagogue may not be demolished with the intention to build another on the same site or on a different site. The proposed synagogue must first be erected, and then the existing structure may be demolished, for fear that a mishap may occur which will prevent the people building. This rule applies even to the erection of a single wall. The new wall must first be set up adjacent to the old wall, which may then be demolished."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.12","12. These rules apply to a structure, of which the foundations are not decayed. But if the foundations are failing or the walls threaten to collapse, the edifice is immediately demolished and work on the new building should be started at once, and proceed expeditiously by day and by night, for fear that there may be delay and the edifice would become a complete ruin."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.13","13. A synagogue may be turned into a house of study, but a house of study may not be turned into a synagogue; the reason being that the sanctity of a house of study exceeds that of a synagogue and objects may be raised to a holier use but not degraded to a less holy use. On the same principle, the residents of a town who sold a synagogue should use the proceeds to purchase a <i>Tebah</i>.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Elevated platform with a desk on which the Scroll of the Law is placed for public reading.</i> If they sold a <i>Tebah,</i> they should buy with the proceeds wraps or a case for the scroll of the law. If they sold wraps or a case for the scroll of the law, they should use the proceeds to purchase single books of the Pentateuch. If they sold single books of the Pentateuch, they should buy with the proceeds a scroll of the law. But if they sold a scroll of the law, nothing else can be bought with the proceeds but another scroll of the law, for there is nothing that exceeds the sanctity of a scroll of the law. This same principle applies to money left over from proceeds of sales of sacred articles after other articles of higher sanctity had been purchased."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.14","14. So too, if the people had collected money to build a house of study or a synagogue, or to buy a <i>Tebah,</i> or wraps and a case (for a scroll of the law) or a scroll of the law, and they desire to use all the money for another purpose, they may only do so if the substitute to be bought is of a higher sanctity. If however the original purpose for which the collection had been made was accomplished, and a surplus was left over, they can use it for any purpose they please. All the appurtenances of a synagogue are in the same category with the synagogue. The curtain above the ark in which the scrolls are placed are in the same class with the wraps of the scrolls. If stipulations had been made with regard to the articles, these stipulations have to be fulfilled."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.15","15. The statement that it is permitted to sell a synagogue only refers to a synagogue, erected in a village for the use of the villagers, that they may have a place where to pray. If all of them agree to sell it, they may do so. But as to a synagogue in a city, since it was built as a public place of worship for all, where any one who comes to that district shall be able to pray, it constitutes the public property of all Israel and may never be sold."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.16","16. Villagers who desire to sell their synagogue, in order to erect with the proceeds another synagogue or purchase a <i>Tebah</i> or a scroll of the law, should stipulate with the purchaser that he is not to turn it into a bathhouse, tannery, ritual bath or laundry. If, at the time of the sale, the seven leaders of the community (forming the Executive), at a meeting of the residents, passed a resolution that the purchaser should be permitted to do any of the above things, it is permitted."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.17","17. So too, if the seven leaders of the community, at a meeting of the residents, resolve that the surplus of the purchase money be used for secular purposes, it may be so used. And when they receive the funds and expend them in the erection of another synagogue, or in the purchase of a <i>Tebah,</i> wraps, a case for a scroll of the law, or a Scroll of the law, or copies of single books of the Pentateuch, the surplus is secular in accordance with their resolution, and may be used for any purpose they please."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.18","18. So too, if all the residents or a majority of them have vested a single individual with authority over them, whatever he does is valid. He can, in his discretion sell or give away, and make any stipulations he deems fit."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.19","19. Just as they are permitted to sell a synagogue, so they may give it away; for unless the community derived some advantage from the gift, they would not have made the gift. They must not however let their synagogue for rent or pledge it as security for a loan. So too, when synagogues are demolished to be rebuilt, the bricks, wood and earth may be sold, exchanged or given away, but not loaned, because the sanctity attached to the material passes only if money or a benefit equivalent to money is obtained in return."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.11.20","20. The broadway of a town, though the people worship there on fast-days and at special services,—the assemblies on such occasions being too large for the synagogues to accomodate—has no sanctity because its sacred use is casual and it has not been appointed for worship. Similarly, houses and courts where people meet for prayer have no sanctity, because they have not been set apart for worship but are only so used casually, just as a man prays in his own home."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.1","1. Moses, our teacher, established the rule for Israel that they should read the Law publicly on Sabbaths and also on the second and fifth days of the week, during the morning service, so that three days shall not elapse without hearing the Law. Ezra established the rule that the <i>Torah</i> should be read at the afternoon service, every Sabbath for the benefit of those who would otherwise spend the day vacuously. He also ordained that on the second and fifth days of the week, three persons should be called to the reading of the Law and that they should read not less than three verses each."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.2","2. The following are the days on which the Law is publicly read: Sabbaths, Festivals, the first day of each month, Fast-days, the Feast of Dedication, the Feast of Lots, the second and fifth day of the week. Lessons from the Prophets are only read on Sabbaths, Festivals and the ninth day of Ab.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*According to the German and Polish ritual, on the other Scriptural fast-days, at the afternoon service.</i>"
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.3","3. The <i>Torah</i> is not read publicly unless at least ten male Israelites—all adults and freemen—are present. A minimum of ten verses must be read. The introductory verse, ""And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying"" is counted among the ten verses. Not less than three must be called to the reading of the Law. They do not begin to read at a place less than three verses from the beginning of a section, nor do they end at a place less than three verses from the close of a section. No reader may read less than three verses."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.4","4. When ten verses are read by three persons, two of them read three verses each, and one reads four verses. The one who reads the four verses, whether he is the first, last or intermediate reader, is praiseworthy."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.5","5. Each reader opens the scroll of the law, looks at the place where he will read and recites the invocation, ""Bless ye the Lord, who is blessed."" The congregation responds, ""Blessed is the Lord, who is blessed for ever and ever."" He then recites the blessing, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**<i>Literally</i> ""Who hath chosen us from all peoples and given us His Law."" God is addressed in the second person, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God because of our consciousness of His existence and attributes—Justice, Kindness, Wisdom and Goodness.

Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who givest<sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">***<i>Literally</i>: ""Who hath given us the Law"" ""Who giveth the Law"" in the 3rd person.</i> the law."" The congregation responds Amen. He then reads his section, till he concludes it, rolls up the scroll, and then recites the blessing, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hath given us a Law of truth and planted eternal life in our midst, blessed art Thou O Lord, Who giveth the Law."""
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.6","6. A person who reads the Law must not begin till the sound of the Amen recited by the congregation has ceased. If he made a mistake, even if only in the correct enunciation of a single letter, he is made to turn back to the place where the mistake was made and read the word correctly. Two are not to read in the <i>Torah</i> at the same time, but only one by himself. If one, while reading, has been suddenly stricken so that he cannot continue, another person should take his place and begin where the stricken one began, and recite the blessing after reading his portion."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.7","7. The person who reads may not do so till the chief member of the congregation invites him to do so. Even the appointed officer of the synagogue or its president does not read, at his own volition, but waits till the congregation or its chief member tells him to do so. And some one should stand at his side, while he is reading, just as the appointed officer stands at the side of other persons who read."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.8","8. The reader has (sometimes<sup>†</sup><i class=""footnote"">†On the Day of Atonement.</i>) to skip from passage to passage—both being on the same theme—as, for instance, that beginning, "".… After the death of the two sons of Aaron"" (Leviticus chapter 16 verse 1) to that beginning, ""And on the tenth day of this seventh month"" (Numbers 29:7-11) which is in the weekly portion <i>Emor.</i> But he must take care not to recite by heart, it being forbidden to recite even a single word without referring to the text. Nor, when skipping, may he pause for a longer time than it takes the interpreter to translate the last verse [of the former passage]."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.9","9. As soon as he has begun to read in the <i>Torah,</i> it is forbidden to converse even on a Halachic topic. All must listen silently and give heed to what he is reading, as it is said, ""And the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the Law"" (Nehemiah 8:3). It is likewise forbidden to leave the synagogue while the <i>Torah</i> is being read. But one may leave in the interval between one section and another. A person who is continuously engaged in the study of the <i>Torah,</i> this being his sole occupation, may continue his study while the Law is being read."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.10","10. Since the days of Ezra it has been the rule that an interpreter shall be present to interpret to the people what the reader is reading in the <i>Torah,</i> so that they may understand the subject-matter. The reader reads one verse only, waits till the interpreter has interpreted it, and then reads the next verse. The reader may not read to the interpreter more than one verse at a time."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.11","11. The reader may not raise his voice above that of the interpreter nor may the interpreter raise his voice above that of the reader. The interpreter may not begin to translate till the sound of the verse uttered by the reader has ceased. The reader may not read the next verse till the interpreter's translation of the previous verse is ended. The interpreter is not to lean against a pillar or beam, but stands in reverence and awe. He does not read the translation from a script but translates it by heart. The reader may not prompt the interpreter so that it should not be said that the translation is written in the <i>Torah.</i> A minor (under thirteen years) may act as interpreter to an adult who is reading. But it is not respectful to an adult that he should act as interpreter to a minor who is reading. There should not be two interpreters acting together. But one reads and one interprets."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.12","12. Not all verses are translated in public. The story of Reuben (Genesis 35:22), The Priestly Benediction (Numbers 6:24-26), the story of the Golden Calf from ""And Moses said to Aaron"" till ""And Moses saw the people etc."" (Exodus 32:21-25) and the verse, ""And God plagued the people"" (Exodus 32:35) are read and not translated. In the story of Amnon (II Samuel c. 13) where the phrase, ""Amnon, son of David"" occurs, it is read and not translated."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.13","13. The person who concludes with the lesson from the prophets has first to read in the Torah, even if it is only three verses. He may repeat what the previous reader has already read. He must not read the lesson from the Prophets till the Scroll of the Law has first been rolled up. He should not read less than twenty-one verses from the prophet. If the topic of the lesson is concluded in a smaller number of verses, he need not read more. If he read ten verses and the interpreter translated them, that is sufficient, even though the topic is not completed. Only one reads the lesson from the prophets, but two may act as interpreters. He may skip from one subject to another, but not from one prophetical book to another except in the minor Prophets; and there he must not pass from the end of the book to the beginning. When skipping, he must not pause longer than it takes the interpreter to recite his translation of what has been read."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.14","14. The person who reads the lesson from the prophets should read for the interpreter three verses, and the interpreter translates the three one after another, but if the three verses are separate sections, he should read for the interpreter one verse at a time."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.15","15. The person who reads the lesson from the prophets, recites, before doing so, one blessing as follows: ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Literally, ""who hath chosen.""</i> chosen good prophets etc.""; and after the lesson, he recites four blessings. The first blessing he concludes with the formula, ""O Lord, God Who are faithful in all Thy words<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**Literally, ""The God who is faithful in all His words.""</i>""; the second with the formula, ""Who rebuildest Jerusalem""; (Spanish and German rituals have ""Who makest Zion joyful through her children"") the third, with the formula, ""Shield of David""; the fourth with a formula referring to the special character of the day—identical with the conclusion of the middle blessing in the <i>Amidah</i> prayer for the day. So if the first day of the month falls on a Sabbath, the person who reads the lesson from the prophets mentions the first day of the month in this blessing, as he does in the <i>Amidah.</i> How many persons read the Law? On Sabbath, in the morning service, seven read the Law; on the Day of Atonement, six; on the festivals, five. These respective numbers may not be diminished but may be increased. On the first day of each month, and on the intermediate days of the festivals, four read the Law. On Sabbath and on the Day of Atonement in the afternoon services, on the second and fifth day of the week throughout the year in the morning service, on the Feast of Lights and on the Feast of Lots in the morning service, and on fast-days in the morning and in the afternoon services, three read the Law. These numbers are neither increased nor diminished."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.16","16. A woman should not read the Law at a congregational service, out of respect to the congregation. A minor who can read and understands to whom the blessings are offered may be counted in the number of those who read the Law. The person who reads the lesson from the Prophets is also counted in their number, since he reads in the <i>Torah</i> as well. If, however, the reader of the congregation intervened with the recital of <i>Kaddish</i> between the reader of the concluding section of the Pentateuchal portion for the day and the reader of the lesson from the Prophets, the latter is not counted in the number of those who read the Law. In a congregation where there is only one individual competent to read, he goes up to the reading-desk, reads a section, goes down, then goes up again and reads a second section, does the same a third time and so on till he has completed the number of those who should have read that day."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.17","17. In each and every one of these readings, a <i>Cohen</i> (descendant of Aaron) reads the first section. He is followed by a Levite (descendant of Levi other than a Cohen) and he, in turn, is followed by an Israelite. It is a universal custom that a <i>Cohen,</i> even though he is illiterate, has precedence over a great scholar in Israel. The person, superior in knowledge reads before one who is his inferior. The reader of the concluding section who rolls up the Scroll will receive a reward equal to that of all the others. Hence, even the greatest man in the congregation goes up [to the reading desk] to complete the portion."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.18","18. Should no <i>Cohen</i> be present, an Israelite goes up to read the <i>Torah</i> and a Levite should not follow. Should no Levite be present, the <i>Cohen</i> who read the first section, reads the second section in place of a Levite. Another <i>Cohen</i> however does not read after the first, lest it be said that the one first called up was unfit and that therefore another <i>Cohen</i> went up. So too, one Levite does not read after another, lest it be said that one of them is unfit."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.19","19. At which part of the service is the <i>Torah</i> read? On the days when an additional <i>Amidah</i> is recited—the Reader, having concluded the morning service, recites <i>Kaddish;</i> takes out a scroll of the Law, and calls members of the congregation individually, who come up and read in the Law. When they have concluded, he replaces the scroll and recites <i>Kaddish;</i> and then the additional service is recited. On days when a lesson from the prophets is read as well as the additional service, it is the usual custom to recite <i>Kaddish</i> before the person comes up to read the lesson from the prophets. In some communities however, <i>Kaddish</i> is recited after the lesson from the prophets has been read."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.20","20. In the afternoon service on Sabbath or on the Day of Atonement, the Reader, after he has ended the recital of the Psalm of David (Psalm 145) and of the Order of Sanctification,<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*The Ashkenazi practice is to say these before <i>Neilah</i> on the Day of Atonement to mark the distinction between that service and the preceding service.</i> recites <i>Kaddish,</i> and takes out the scroll of the Law, which is read by members of the congregation. He then replaces the scroll and recites <i>Kaddish.</i> The afternoon <i>Amidah</i> is then recited. On Festivals, it is not customary to read the Law during the afternoon service."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.21","21. On a day when no additional service is recited, the reader, after concluding the morning <i>Amidah</i> recites <i>Kaddish</i> and takes out a scroll of the Law which is read. He then replaces it, recites <i>Kaddish,</i> then repeats Psalm 145 and the ""Order of Sanctification"", as on other days, recites <i>Kaddish,</i> after which the people depart."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.22","22. Scrolls of single books of the Pentateuch are not used for reading at services in synagogues, out of respect to the congregation. Nor is the scroll of the Law rolled<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">*To the right place for the reading.</i> at a public service, out of regard to the convenience of the congregants so that they should not have the trouble of standing while the scroll is being rolled. Hence, if two sections in different parts of the text are to be read, two scrolls are taken out. One person must not read one section in two scrolls, lest it will be said that the first scroll was defective and therefore he read out of the second."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.12.23","23. The person who rolls up the scroll rolls it from without.<sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">***Towards himself, if he holds and rolls the scroll, himself. If one sits, holding the scroll and another standing before him rolls the scroll, he should roll it inwards, so that the written part shall not be exposed.</i> When fastening it, the fastening should be placed within.<sup>†</sup><i class=""footnote"">†The knot of the band which is wound round the scroll is placed inside the scroll so that the scroll should not have to be turned on its face to undo the knot.</i> And he should set it with the seams in the centre.<sup>‡</sup><i class=""footnote"">‡So that if the outside sheet of the scroll weakens, the seams connecting one sheet with another would come apart and the scroll would not be torn.</i> In a place where the scroll of the Law, after being read, is taken out of the Synagogue and removed to another place for the sake of security, the Congregation must not leave the synagogue till the scroll has been taken out and they must accompany it, following it to the place where it is deposited."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.1",The Paragraphs in the following chapters are only separated by blank spaces in the manuscript. The numbers are those in the extant editions.
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.2","1. The custom prevailing through Israel is [that the reading of the Pentateuch is completed in one year]<sup>††</sup><i class=""footnote"">††The passage in brackets is omitted in the manuscript, apparently erased.</i>. It is begun on the Sabbath after the feast of Tabernacles, when the portion commencing <i>Bereshith</i> ""In the Beginning"" (Genesis 1:1) is read. On the second Sabbath, that beginning, ""These are the generations of Noah"" (Genesis 6:9) is read; on the third, that beginning, ""And the Lord said to Abraham"" (ibid. 12:1), and so on in regular order till the last portion is read on the feat of Tabernacles. Some complete the reading of the Pentateuch in three years, but this is not a prevalent custom."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.3","2. Ezra instituted the rule for Israel that the portion containing the Imprecations in the book of Leviticus (26:3-end of book) should be read before the feast of Pentecost; and those in the book of Deuteronomy (26:1-29:8) before the New Year. The prevalent custom is to read the portion <i>Bemidbar Sinai</i> (Numbers 1:1-4:20) before Pentecost; <i>Vaethchanan</i> (Deuteronomy 3:23-7:11) after the Ninth of Ab; <i>Atem Nitzabim</i> (Deuteronomy 29:9-30:20) before the New Year; <i>Tzav ess Aharon</i> (Leviticus 6:1-8:36) before Passover in an ordinary year (of twelve months). Hence, on some Sabbaths, two portions are read during the morning service, for example, <i>Isha Ki Tazria</i> (Leviticus 12:1-13:59) and <i>Vezoth tihejeh Torath Hametzora</i> (ibid. 14:1-15:33); <i>Bechukotai</i> (ibid. 26:3-end of book) and <i>Behar Sinai</i> (ibid. 25:1-26:2) etc.; the purpose being to ensure that the reading of the Pentateuch shall be completed in one year and that the portions above mentioned shall be read at their appointed periods."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.4","3. At the place in the <i>Torah</i> where the reading is ended in the morning service, it is resumed, with the next verse, in the afternoon service of that day, in the morning services of the coming Monday and Thursday, and also in the moring service of the next Sabbath. For example, on the first Sabbath (after the feast of Tabernacles) the portion <i>Bereshith</i> is read during the morning service. In the afternoon service ten or more verses are read from the beginning of the portion, <i>Eleh Toledoth Noach;</i> as also on the following Monday and Thursday. On the next Sabbath likewise, in the morning service <i>Eleh Toledoth Noach</i> is begun and read to the close of the portion for the week. This method is followed throughout the year. The reading of the portion from the Pentateuch is followed by a section from the prophets, corresponding in content with what had been read in the Pentateuch."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.5","4. On the first day of each month, the person first called to the reading of the Law reads three verses from the section beginning <i>Tzav</i> (Numbers 28:1-8). The second person called to the Law repeats the third verse already read by the person called before him and adds the two following verses, so as to leave three verses to the end of the section. The third person called to the Law reads these three verses and also the next section beginning <i>Uveyom Hashabbath</i> (ibid. 28:9-10). The fourth person called to the Law reads the section beginning <i>Uvrashé Chodshechem</i> (ibid. 28:11-15). When the first of the month falls on a Sabbath, two scrolls of the Law are taken out during the morning service. In the first, the portion for the week is read; and in the second, the one who completes the reading reads <i>Uverashé Chodshechem</i> (Numbers 28:11-15). The person who reads the lesson from the Prophets is the one who reads the section concerning the New Moon. The lesson from the Prophets is that section which concludes, ""And it shall come to pass that month by month etc."" (Isaiah 66:23). When the first of Ab falls on a Sabbath, the lesson from the prophets is the section containing the verses, ""Your new moons and your festivals my soul hateth"" (ibid. 1:14). When the first day of the month falls on the first day of the week the lesson from the prophets on the preceding Sabbath day is the section beginning, ""And Jonathan said unto him; tomorrow is New Moon"" (I Samuel 20:18-42)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.6","5. Every one who goes up to read the Law commences and concludes with a happy theme. But in the weekly portion of <i>Haazinu</i> (Deuteronomy, Chapter 32), the first one who is called up reads up to ""Remember the days of old"" (verse 7). The second begins, ""Remember the days of old"" and reads up to ""He made him ride on the high places of the earth"" (v. 13). The third from that verse to, ""And the Lord saw and spurned"" (v. 19). The fourth, from that verse to, ""If they were wise"" (v. 29). The fifth, from that verse to ""For I lift up my hand to heaven"" (v. 40). The sixth, from that verse to the end of the Song (v. 43). Why do they leave off at these points? Because they are rebukes, and so the people will be induced to repent."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.7","6. The eight verses which conclude the Pentateuch (Deuteronomy 34:5-12) may be read in synagogue even when there are less than ten (male adults) present. Though it is all <i>Torah</i> and Moses uttered them as received from the mouth of the Almighty, still as they convey the thought that they were composed after Moses' death, they have clearly been altered (from the text as it stood originally). An individual may therefore read them (without a quorum)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.8","7. The Maledictions in the book of Leviticus (26:14-43) are not broken up among different readers; but one person reads them all, beginning with the verse before, and closing with the verse after them.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*According to our practice four verses before and three after.</i> As to the Maledictions in the book of Deuteronomy, one may, if he wishes, break off in the middle. The people have, however, the custom not to do so; but one person reads them all."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.9","8. The regular sequence is interrupted for the three Festivals and for the Day of Atonement, when we read a section appertaining to the Festival and not the weekly portion of the Sabbath. Moses ordained that on each festival a section bearing upon it should be read. On every festival too, the discussion and discourse are on the topic of the day. What sections are read? On Passover, from the section concerning the festivals in the book of Leviticus (22:26-23:44). The people have however the custom of reading on the first day that beginning, ""Draw out, and take unto yourselves lambs (Exodus 12:21-51); and the lesson from the Prophets is the account of the Passover at Gilgal (Joshua 5:2-15). On the second day, that beginning, ""When a bullock or sheep"" (Leviticus 22:26-23:44); and the lesson from the Prophets is the account of Josiah's Celebration of the Passover (II Kings 23:1-25). On the third day, that beginning, ""Sanctify unto me all the first born"" (Exodus 13:1-16). On the fourth day, that beginning, ""If thou lend money"" (Exodus 22:24-23:19). On the fifth day, that beginning, ""Hew thee two tables of stone"" (ibid. 34:1-26). On the sixth day, that beginning, ""Let the children of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season"" (Numbers 9:1-14). On the seventh day, that beginning, ""And it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go"" (Exodus 13:17-15:26) to the end of the Song, and up to the words ""I am the Lord that healeth thee""; and the lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, ""And David spoke"" (II Samuel 22:1-51). On the eighth day, that beginning, ""All the firstling males"" (Deuteronomy 15:19-16:17); and the lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, ""This very day"" (Isaiah 10:32-12:6)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.10","9. On Pentecost, the section from the Pentateuch is that beginning, ""Seven weeks"" (Deuteronomy 16:9-17). But the general custom is to read on the first day of the feast the section beginning, ""In the third month"" (Exodus 19:1-20:26). And the lesson from the Prophets is ""The vision of the Chariots"" (Ezekiel 1:1-28). On the second day the section read is that concerning the Festivals, beginning, ""All the firstling males"" (Deuteronomy 15:19-16:17) and the lesson from the Prophets is taken from Habakuk (3:1-end)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.11","10. On New Year, the section is that beginning, ""And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month"" (Numbers 29:1). It is however a general custom to read on the first day the section beginning, ""And the Lord remembered Sarah"" (Genesis 21:1-34); and the lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, ""Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim—zophim"" (I Samuel 1:1-2:10). On the second day, the section read is that beginning, ""And it came to pass after these things that God did prove Abraham"" (Genesis 22:1-24); and the lesson from the Prophets is that concluding, ""Is Ephraim a darling son unto me"" (Jeremiah 31:1-19)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.12","11. On the Day of Atonement, in the morning service, the section read is that beginning, ""After the death of the two sons of Aaron"" (Leviticus 16:1-34); and the lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, ""For thus saith the High and Lofty One"" (Isaiah 57:15-58:14). In the afternoon service, the section read is that concerning Incests in the portion beginning, ""After the death of the two sons of Aaron"" (Leviticus Chapter 18). The purpose aimed at is that anyone who has been guilty of any of these offences should remember and be abashed. The third person called up reads in the <i>Torah</i> and recites, as the lesson from the Prophets, the book of Jonah."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.13","12. On the feast of Tabernacles, the section read on each of the first two days is that referring to the Festivals and beginning, ""When a bullock or a sheep or a goat is brought forth"" (Leviticus 22:26-23:44). The lesson from the Prophets on the first day is that beginning, ""Behold, a day of the Lord cometh"" (Zechariah 14:1-21). The lesson from the Prophets on the second day is that beginning, ""And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto King Solomon"" (I Kings 8:2-21). On the eighth day, the section from the Pentateuch is that beginning, ""Every first born"" (Deuteronomy 15:19-16:17). The lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, ""And it was so that when Solomon had made an end of prayer"" (I Kings 8:54-66). On the following day, the weekly portion beginning, ""And this is the blessing"" (Deuteronomy 33:1-34:12) is read. The lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, ""And Solomon stood"" (I Kings 8:22-53). Some read, as the lesson from the Prophets that beginning, ""Now it came to pass after the death of Moses"" (Joshua 1:1-18). On the other (intermediate) days of the Feast, the sections concerning the sacrifices for the festival are read (Numbers 29:17-34)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.14","13. How so? On every one of the intermediate days of the festival, two sections of the Pentateuch are read. On the third day of the feast, which is an intermediate day, the <i>Cohen</i> (first called to the reading of the Law) reads the section beginning, ""And on the second day"" (Numbers 29:17-19). The Levite (the second called) reads the section beginning, ""And on the third day"" (ibid, 29:20-22). The Israelite (the third called) reads the section beginning, ""And on the third day"" (ibid. 29:20-22). The fourth person called reads the section beginning, ""And on the second day"" and that beginning, ""And on the third day."" On the fourth day of the festival, which is the second of the intermediate days, the section beginning, ""And on the third day"" and that beginning, ""And on the fourth day"" are read in this way. The same order is followed throughout the intermediate days."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.15","14. On every festival, and likewise on the Day of Atonement and on all the seven days of Passover, two scrolls of the Law are taken out of the ark. In the first, the sections we have named are read. In the second, the section in the book of Numbers referring to the sacrifice for the day (Numbers 28:16-29:39) is read. The reader of the last reads also the lesson from the Prophets."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.16","15. Whenever two or three scrolls of the Law are taken out of the ark, if they are taken out one after the other, the <i>Kaddish</i> is recited after the first is replaced, and then the second is taken out. After this has been replaced, <i>Kaddish</i> is again recited. We have however already stated that the plain custom is always to recite <i>Kaddish</i> after the person last called to read has finished reading, and then the lesson from the Prophets is read."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.17","16. On the intermediate Sabbath of Passover or Tabernacles, the section read is that beginning, ""See, Thou sayest unto me"" (Exodus 33:12-34:26). The lesson from the Prophets, on Passover, is Ezekiel's vision of the Valley of Dry Bones (Ezekiel 37:1-14); and, on Tabernacles the Prediction concerning Gog (ibid. 38:18-39:16)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.18","17. On the first day of the Feast of Dedication, the section read is that containing the Priestly Benediction and continuing till the end of the section referring to the offering on the first day of the Dedication of the Tabernacle (Numbers 6:22-7:17). On the second day, the section read is that referring to the offering of the prince who brought his offering on the second day of that Dedication (ibid. 7:18-23). And so on till the eighth day, the section read is that referring to the offering on the eighth day of the Dedication of the Tabernacle up to the end of the summary of the offerings and continuing till the end of the weekly portion (ibid. 7:54-89).<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Ashkenazi practice is to add ibid. 8:1-4.</i> On Sabbath, the lesson from the Prophets is Zechariah's Vision of the Candelabrum (Zechariah 2:14-4:7). If there are two Sabbaths in the feast of Dedication, Zechariah's Vision of the Candelabrum is the lesson from the Prophets on the first Sabbath; and, on the second Sabbath, the account of the Candelabra in Solomon's Temple (I Kings 7:40-50) is read. The person who reads in the scroll the special section for the feast of Dedication reads the lesson from the Prophets."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.19","18. On the Feast of Lots, the section beginning, ""And Amalek came"" (Exodus 17:8-16) is read in the morning service. On the Ninth of Ab, the section read in the morning service is that beginning, ""When thou shalt beget children"" (Deuteronomy 4:25-40). The lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, ""I will consume them"" (Jeremiah 8:13-9:23). In the afternoon service, the sections beginning, ""And Moses besought"" (Exodus 32:11-14) and also (34:1-10) are read, as on the other fast-days and on those that are kept in commemoration of the calamities that befell our ancestors. These sections are read in the morning and afternoon services. The first person called up reads four verses from the section beginning, ""And Moses besought."" The second and third persons read from the section beginning, ""Hew thee two tables of stone"" till ""That I am about to do with thee"" (Exodus 34:1-10). On fast days appointed by the community because of existing calamities such as drought, pestilence or similar visitations, the Benedictions and Maledictions (Leviticus 26:3-46 or Deuteronomy 28:1-69) are read, so that the people, when they listen to them, may be moved to repent and their hearts be humbled."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.20","19. The people have the custom of reading on the three Sabbaths before the Ninth of Ab, as lessons from the Prophets, passages of an admonitory character. On the first of these Sabbaths, the lesson from the Prophets is the section beginning, ""The words of Jeremiah"" (Jeremiah 1:1-2:3). On the second Sabbath, that beginning, ""The vision of Isaiah"" (Isaiah 1:1-20). On the third Sabbath, that beginning, ""How is the faithful city become a harlot"" (ibid. 1:21-2:4).<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**Ashkenazi custom is to read respectively on these Sabbaths before the Ninth of Ab, Jeremiah 1:1-2:3, 2:4-28 and Isaiah 1:1-27.</i> On the Sabbath after the Ninth of Ab, the lesson from the Prophets is the section beginning, ""Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people"" (Isaiah 40:1-26). It is the general custom in our city to read comforting messages from Isaiah as the lessons from the Prophets on the Sabbaths after the Ninth of Ab till the New Year. On the Sabbath between the New Year and the Day of Atonement, the lesson from the Prophets is the section beginning ""Return O Israel"" (Hosea 14:2-10)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.21","20. When the first day of the month of Adar falls on a Sabbath, the section concerning the Half Shekel (Exodus 30:11-16) is read; and the lesson from the Prophets is that relating to Jehoiadah the Priest (II Kings 11:17-12:17). When the first of Adar falls on a weekday, even on a Friday, the section concerning the Half-Shekel is read on the previous Sabbath. On the second Sabbath of the month, the section commencing ""Remember"" (Deuteronomy 25:17-19) is read. The lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, ""I remember that which Amalek did to Israel"" (I Samuel 15:1-34). What is meant by the second Sabbath? It is the Sabbath preceding the week in which the Feast of Lots occurs, even if that falls on Friday. On the third Sabbath, the section concerning the Red Heifer (Numbers 19:1-22) is read. The lesson from the Prophets is that containing the verse, ""And I will sprinkle upon you"" (Ezekiel 36:16-36). What is meant by the third Sabbath? That immediately preceding the fourth. On the fourth Sabbath, the section beginning, ""This month"" (Exodus 12:1-20) is read. The lesson from the Prophets is that beginning ""In the first month, on the first day of the month (Ezekiel 45:18-46:15). The fourth Sabbath is that beginning the week in which the first of Nissan occurs, even if it falls on Friday."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.22","21. Hence, there will sometimes be a plain Sabbath (on which no additional section is read) between the first and the second of these four special Sabbaths, or between the second and the third. In some years there will be two such Sabbaths; namely, between the first and second special Sabbaths, and between the second and third. But there is no plain Sabbath between the third and fourth special Sabbaths."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.23","22. Each of these four special sections is read in a second scroll, after the portion for the week has been read in the scroll first taken out. If the first of Adar falls on a Sabbath, and the portion for the week was that commencing, ""And thou shalt command"" (Exodus 27:20-30:10), six persons are called to the Law and read in the weekly portion up to (but not including) the section beginning, ""Thou shalt also make a laver"" (ibid. 30:17). The seventh person reads the section beginning, ""When thou takest the sum"" till that beginning, ""Thou shalt also make a laver"" (ibid 30:11-16). If the portion of the week for that Sabbath is that beginning, ""When thou takest the sum"" (ibid. 30:11), six persons are called to the Law and read this portion, till the next beginning, ""And Moses assembled"" (ibid. 35:1). The seventh person reads in the second scroll the section beginning, ""When thou takest the sum"" till ""Thou shalt make also a laver"" (ibid. 30:11-16)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.24","23. When the first of Adar falls on Sabbath, three scrolls are taken out. In the first, the portion of the week is read; in the second the section relating to the sacrifices on the first of the month, (Numbers 28:9-15); and in the third, that beginning, ""When thou takest the sum"" (Exodus 30:11-16). So too, when the first of Nisan falls on Sabbath, three scrolls are taken out. The portion of the week is read in the first; the section relating to the sacrifices ""on the first of the month"" (Numbers 28:9-15) in the second; and, in the third, that commencing, ""This month"" (Exodus 12.1-20)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.25","24. When the first of Tebeth falls on Sabbath, three scrolls are taken out. In the first, the portion of the week is read; in the second, the section relating to the sacrifices on the first of the month (Numbers 28:9-15); in the third, the portion read on the feast of Dedication (a section from Numbers 6:22-8:4). When the first of Tebeth falls on a week day, three persons read the section concerning the sacrifices on the first of the month (Numbers 28:9-15); and the fourth person, one of the sections appropriate to the Feast of Dedication (Numbers 6:22-8:4)."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.13.26","25. Although a person hears the whole of the Pentateuch at the public services on the Sabbaths throughout the year, he is under an obligation to read it thrice—twice read the text and once in the Onkelos [Aramaic] version—a verse left untranslated being read thrice—and so he will conclude the weekly portions concurrently with the Congregation."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.14.1","1. In the morning service, in the additional service and in the <i>Neilah</i> (closing) service, the priests uplift their hands to pronounce the Priestly Benediction. This is not done in the afternoon service; for in the afternoon [on ordinary days] all have had their meals, and the priests may possibly have drunk wine, and an inebriate is forbidden to perform this rite. Nor even on a fast-day do they pronounce the Priestly Benediction, for fear that if permitted on such a day, the rule might be disregarded in the afternoon service on other days."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.14.2","2. This rule applies to a fast-day on which both the afternoon and <i>Neilah</i> services are recited; for example, the Day of Atonement and a public fast-day (specially appointed). [It is different however with] a fast-day when there is no <i>Neilah,</i> for example, the Ninth of Ab or the Seventeenth of Tammuz. The reason is that the afternoon service, being recited on such a day near sunset, appears to have the character of <i>Neilah</i> and will not be confused with the afternoon service on other days. Hence the Priestly Benediction is pronounced on such a fast-day. A priest who transgressed the rule and went up in front of the ark on the Day of Atonement in the afternoon service is permitted to raise his hands to pronounce the Benediction—as it is known that on this day there is no inebriety—and he is not made to step down, so as not to give rise to the suspicion that he was disqualified and therefore had been made to step down."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.14.3","3. How is this rite performed outside the Temple? When the Reader of the congregation reaches the paragraph in the <i>Amidah</i> referring to the restoration of the ancient service and he utters the first word of that blessing beginning ""Be pleased"",<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*The first of the last three blessings of the <i>Amidah.</i></i> all the priests in the synagogue leave their places, proceed to the platform in front of the ark, stand there, with their faces towards the ark and their backs towards the congregation, their fingers bent in their palms, till the Reader concludes the paragraph of thanksgiving.<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**The second of these last three blessings.</i> Then they turn their faces toward the congregation, straighten their fingers, raise their hands to a level with their shoulders and begin reciting, ""May the Lord bless thee"". The Reader prompts them, word by word, and they repeat, as it is said, ""Say unto them"", which means that they are to wait till he recites. When they have ended the first verse, all the people respond, ""Amen"". The Reader of the congregation prompts them in the second verse, word for word, which they repeat till they have ended the second verse, when all the people respond, ""Amen"". And so with the third verse."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.14.4","4. When the priests have concluded reciting the three verses of the Benediction, the Reader begins the last paragraph of the <i>Amidah,</i> that beginning, ""Grant Peace"". The priests turn their faces towards the ark, bend their fingers<sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">***(and drop the hands.)</i> and remain standing on the platform till he concludes the paragraph, and then they return to their places."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.14.5","5. The prompter may not summon the priests till the sound of the congregation's ""Amen"" to the previous blessing<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*The second of the last three blessings of the <i>Amidah.</i></i> has ceased. The priests may not begin the introductory blessing, ""Who hath sanctified us with the sanctification of Aaron and commanded us to bless His people Israel with love"" till the sound of the prompter's summons to the priests has ceased. The congregation do not respond ""Amen"" till the sound of the priest's utterance of the first verse of the Benediction has ceased. The priests do not begin the second verse of the Benediction till the sound of the congregation's ""Amen"" has ceased. The Reader may not join in the congregational response ""Amen"" after the priests' Benediction, lest he become confused and will not know which verse of the Benediction he has to prompt, whether the second or third."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.14.6","6. The priests may not turn their faces away from the congregation till the Reader begins the paragraph commencing, ""Grant Peace"". Nor may they bend their fingers till they have turned their faces away from the congregation. It is one of the ordinances instituted by Rabban [Yachanan ben Zaccai] that the priests do not ascend to the platform in front of the ark, wearing shoes, but they stand there barefoot."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.14.7","7. While the priests bless the people, they may not look at the people, nor allow their minds to wander. Their eyes should look to the ground like one engaged in prayer. No one may gaze at the priests while they are blessing the people so that their attention should not be distracted. All the people should concentrate their minds, so as to hear the Benediction and turn their faces towards the faces of the priests, but they do not look at them."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.14.8","8. If only one priest pronounces the Benediction, he begins to recite without being summoned. The congregational Reader prompts him, word for word, as stated. If there were two or more priests they do not begin to bless the people, till the Reader has summoned them with the formula, ""Priests"". They respond, ""The Lord bless thee"". He then prompts them, word for word, in the order stated."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.14.9","9. How was the rite of the Priestly Benediction performed in the Temple? The priests went up to the platform after the conclusion of the morning sacrifice. They raised their hands, with fingers straightened, above their heads; except the High Priest who did not raise his hands higher than the Golden Plate.<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**on his forehead; the plate had the words engraved, ""holy to God"".</i> One prompted them, word for word, just as is done outside the temple, till they had concluded the three verses of the Benediction. The people did not respond ""Amen"" after each verse. But all the three verses were recited as one blessing. When they concluded, all the people responded, ""Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting."""
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.14.10","10. The name of God was pronounced as written; that is, the name of which the utterance is according to the letters <i>Yod, He, Vav, He.</i> This is the Ineffable Name (literally the Proper Name), wherever it is referred to. Outside the temple the usual pronunciation is used, as if it were written A.D.N.I.<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Adonai—my Lord.</i>; for the Proper Name of God as written, is pronounced nowhere but in the Temple. After the death of Simon the Just, the priests ceased to utter the proper name of God in the Benediction, even in the Temple, so that an unworthy or unsuitable person should not learn it. The ancient teachers did not teach this name to their disciples or sons, even when they were worthy, except once in seven years—all this out of respect to the Honored and Revered Name of God."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.14.11","11. The Priestly Benediction, wherever it is recited, must be recited only in Hebrew, as it is said, ""Thus shall ye bless the Children of Israel."" A tradition dating back to Moses is the authority for the following exposition: ""Thus shall ye bless"", that means, standing. ""Thus shall ye bless"", that means, with hands raised. ""Thus shall ye bless"", that means, in the Holy Tongue. ""Thus shall ye bless"" that means, face to face with the congregation. ""Thus shall ye bless"", that means uttering the Proper Name of God. This however is uttered thus, only when the Benediction is pronounced in the Temple, as already stated."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.14.12","12. In no place may the priests add, either softly or aloud, a blessing to the three verses of the Benediction, such as, ""The Lord, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many more as you are"", or other verses of a similar tenor, for it is said, ""Thou shalt not add to it"" (Deuteronomy 13:1). Every priest proceeding to the platform to pronounce the Benediction, as soon as he starts, says, ""May it be Thy Will, O Lord our God, that this Benediction which Thou hast commanded us to bless therewith Thy people Israel shall be a perfect blessing. May there be in it no stumbling nor perverseness from now and for evermore"". Before the priest turns his face towards the people to bless them, he recites the blessing, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast sanctified us with the sanctification of Aaron and commanded us to bless Thy people Israel with love"". He then turns his face to the congregation and begins to bless them. And when he turns his face away from the congregation, after he had concluded the Benediction, he says ""We have done that which Thou hast decreed unto us. Do Thou fulfill unto us that which Thou hast promised unto us. Do Thou look down from Thy holy habitation, from Heaven, and bless Thy People Israel""."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.14.13","13. When the priests turn their faces towards the people to bless them, and when they turn their faces away, after blessing them, they should always turn to the right. And so too, whenever any one turns, it should always be to the right."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.14.14","14. The Priestly Benediction was pronounced in the Temple once every day, after the morning sacrifice had been offered up. The priests came and stood upon the steps of the Temple porch and blessed the people in the form we have stated. Outside the Temple, the Benediction was pronounced at the close of each service except that of the afternoon, as previously stated. The endeavour is everywhere made to secure an Israelite (one who is not a priest) as prompter; as it is said, ""Say unto them"", which implies that the prompter is not to be one of them."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.15.1",1. Six things prevent the performance of the rite of the Priestly Benediction: Defective speech; Physical blemishes; Transgressions; Wine; Age; Uncleanliness of the hands.
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.15.2","Defective speech: Sufferers from a defect in speech, who cannot utter the letters as they should be pronounced, who, for example, read <i>Aleph</i> as if it were <i>Ayin,</i> or vice versa, or <i>Shibboleth</i> as if it were <i>Sibboleth,</i> etc., do not perform the rite of the Priestly Benediction. So too, those who are heavy of tongue and whose utterance is thick so that they are not understood by all, do not perform this rite."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.15.3","2. Physical blemishes: A priest who has blemishes on his face, hands or feet, as, for instance one whose fingers are twisted inwards or sideways, or whose hands are covered with tetters, does not perform this rite, as the people will stare at him. He who slavers, when speaking, or is blind of one eye, shall not perform this rite. If however, the person who is blind of one eye, or slavers is a well known and familiar figure in the town, he is permitted to perform the rite, as no one will stare at him. So too, a person whose hands are stained with indigo or other colouring material, shall not perform this rite. But if the majority of the residents in that town are engaged in the dyeing industry, he may do so, as they will not stare at him."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.15.4","3. Transgressions: A priest who had slain a human being, even if he has repented, must not perform this rite, for it is said, ""Your hands are full of blood"" (Isaiah 1:15), and it is further written, ""And when ye spread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you"" (Isaiah 1:15). A priest who had worshiped idols, whether under compulsion or in error, even if he had repented, must never perform this rite, for it is said, ""Nevertheless, the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem"" (II Kings 23:9); and the Priestly Benediction is like the Temple service, as it is said, ""To minister unto Him and to bless in His name"" (Deuteronomy 10:8). So too, a priest who had become a convert to idolatry, though he returned to Judaism, never performs this rite. The commission of other transgressions is no disqualification."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.15.5",4. Age: A priest who is a youth does not perform this rite till his beard has grown.
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.15.6","Wine: One who has drunk a fourth of a log<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*A log is equal in capacity to six hen's eggs, hence a quarter of a log equals one and a half eggs.</i> of wine in one draught does not perform this rite till the effect of the wine has passed off—the Priestly Benediction being analogous to the Temple service. If, however, he drank a fourth of a log of wine in two draughts, or diluted it with a little water, he is permitted to perform the rite. If he drank more than a quarter of a log, even mixed with water, and even if he drank it in several draughts, he must not perform the rite till the effect of the wine has passed off. How much is the fourth of a log? The contents of a vessel two finger breadths long, two finger breadths wide and two and seven-tenths finger breadths high. In all measurements throughout the Torah, the finger used is the thumb, called <i>Bohen Yad.</i>"
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.15.7","5. Uncleanliness of the hands: A priest who has not washed his hands must not perform this rite. But he first washes his hands as far as the wrists, just as the priests did in preparation for the Temple service and then he blesses the people, as it is said, ""Lift up your hands to the sanctuary"",<sup>**</sup><i class=""footnote"">**That is, wash your hands for a holy service.</i> (Psalms 134:2). The profaned<sup>***</sup><i class=""footnote"">***Who himself, or whose father prior to his birth, has violated the restrictions on the priests in marital relations.</i> priest does not perform this rite because he has not the status of priesthood."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.15.8","6. A priest who is free from any of these disqualifications, even though he is not a scholar nor punctilious in the observance of religious duties, and even though people talk about him and his dealings are not marked by strict integrity, nevertheless pronounces the Priestly Benediction and should not be prevented from performing the rite; since it is a duty incumbent on every qualified priest to bless the people, and we do not say to a wicked man, ""Be still more wicked and abstain from fulfilling religious duties."""
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.15.9","7. Do not wonder and say, ""Of what use is the blessing of this ordinary person?"" The acceptance of the Benediction does not depend upon the priest but upon the Almighty, as it is said, ""So shall they put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them"" (Numbers 6:27). The priests fulfill their duty with which they have been charged, and the Almighty, in His mercy, blesses Israel according to His will."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.15.10","8. The people in the rear of the priests are not included in the blessing. Those, however, who stand at their side are included. If there was a partition—even if it were an iron wall—between the priests and those that were being blessed, since their faces are turned toward those of the priests, they are included in the blessing."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.15.11","9. The Benediction by the priests requires the presence of ten [male adult] Israelites, the priests being counted in the quorum. If the Congregation present in the synagogue consists wholly of priests, all of them perform the rite of pronouncing the Benediction. Whom are they blessing? Their brethren in the north and their brethren in the south. Who responds Amen to their blessings? The women and children. If, in addition to those who have gone up to the platform, there are ten priests present, these ten respond Amen, and the rest pronounce the Benediction."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.15.12","10. In a congrgation where there is no other priest but the Reader, he does not perform the rite of the Priestly Benediction. But he may perform it if he is confident that after doing so, he will return to the reading of the service. In a congregation where there is no priest, the Reader, when he comes to the last paragraph, beginning, ""Grant peace"" first recites the following: ""Our God and God of our fathers, bless us with the threefold blessing of Thy Law, written by the hand of Moses, Thy servant, which was spoken by the mouth of Aaron and his sons, the priests, Thy holy people, as it is said, 'The Lord bless thee and keep thee: The Lord make His face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee: the Lord turn His face unto thee and give thee peace. So shall they put my name upon the children of Israel and I will bless them' "". The people do not respond Amen. He then begins the paragraph, ""Grant peace etc."""
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.15.13","11. A priest who, after performing the rite in one synagogue, went to another synagogue and found that the congregation was at prayers, but had not yet reached the Priestly Benediction, repeats the rite. And he may do so several times in the day. A priest who had not moved from his place to go up to the platform while the reader was reciting the paragraph beginning, ""Be pleased with the service of Thy people etc."", may not go up during that service. But if he had moved to go up to the platform, even though he had not reached it till this paragraph was concluded, he goes up and blesses the people."
"LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING,.15.14","12. The priest who does not go up to the platform to bless the people, although he has neglected to fulfill one affirmative precept, is accounted as having transgressed three affirmative precepts, for it is said, ""On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel""; ""Ye shall say unto them""; ""So shall they put my name"" (Numbers 6:22-27). Any priest who does not bless the people is not blessed. Every priest who blesses them is blessed, for it is said, ""I will bless them that bless thee"" (Genesis 12:3). Blessed be the All-Merciful who hath helped us."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.1","1. The four Pentateuchal sections, beginning respectively, ""Sanctify unto me"" (Ex. 13:1-10), ""And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee"" (Exodus 13:11-16)—these two being in the Book of Exodus, ""Hear, O Israel"" (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) ""And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently"" (Deuteronomy 11:13-21), are written and covered with a skin. These are called <i>Tephillin,</i> and are placed upon the head and bound on the arm. The omission of the point of a single letter in any one of these sections bars, according to Scriptural enactment, the use of all of them. They must all be written perfectly and in accordance with rule."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.2","2. This is the case also with the two sections of the <i>Mezuzah,</i> beginning respectively, ""Hear, O Israel"" (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) and ""And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). If the point of a letter is missing in these two sections, the <i>Mezuzah</i> may not, according to Scriptural enactment, be used. The two sections must be written perfectly. So too, a scroll of the Law, in which a single letter is missing, is unfit for use."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.3","3. There are ten points in regard to <i>Tephillin</i> (phylacteries). The observance of each is enjoined by a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. The neglect of any of them is an absolute bar to the use of the <i>Tephillin.</i> Hence, if there was a variation in any one of them, the <i>Tephillin</i> are unfit for use. Two of these have reference to the writing; eight, to the covering and the tying of the straps. The two points to be observed in the writing are that the sections must be written with ink, and must be written on parchment."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.4","4. How is the ink prepared? Soot of oils or of pitch, wax or similar substance is collected; kneaded with gum of trees and a little honey; thoroughly wetted and pounded till it is like wafers. It is then stored away. When the scribe wishes to write, he soaks it in water in which gall-apples or similar substances have been steeped, and with this fluid he writes. Such writing when erased leaves no mark. This is the best way to write scrolls of the Law, <i>Tephillin</i> and <i>Mezuzahs.</i> If the scribe has written with fluid of the gall-oak or of caper,<xref rid=""fn56"">*</xref> since the writing stays and is not rubbed out, scrolls of the Law, <i>Tephillin</i> or <i>Mezuzahs</i> so written are fit for use."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.5","5. This being so, what is excluded by the Halacha, dating back to Moses, which ordains that these must be written with ink? It excludes pigments of other colors, such as red or green, etc.; so that if even a single letter in a scroll of the Law, <i>Tephillin</i> or <i>Mezuzah</i> was written with pigment of any other color [but black] or with gold, such a Scroll, <i>Tephillin</i> or <i>Mezuzah</i> is unfit for use."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.6","6. There are three kinds of parchment, <i>Gewil, Kelaf</i> and <i>Duxustus.</i> How are these made? A hide of domestic cattle or wild beast is taken. First, its hair is removed. It is then pickled in salt, afterwards prepared with flour and subsequently tanned with gall-wood or similar materials which contract the pores of the hide and make it durable. And this it is that is called <i>Gewil</i> (parchment of whole-hide leather)."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.7","7. If, after removing the hair, the hide had been split through its thickness into two parts, so as to make of it two skins, one thin, namely that which had been next to the hair; the other thick, namely that which had been next to the flesh, and if these were prepared first with salt, then with flour and afterwards with gall-wood or similar substance the skin which had been next to the hair is called <i>Kelaf</i> (= outer-skin parchment), and that which had been next to the flesh is called <i>Duxustus</i> (inner-skin parchment)."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.8","8. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that the scroll of the Law should be written on <i>Gewil</i> (whole hide parchment), and the writing should be on the side which had been next to the hair. The <i>Tephillin</i> should be written on <i>Kelaf</i> (the exterior part of the split hide) and the writing should be on the side which had been nearer the flesh; and the <i>Mezuzah</i> should be written on <i>Duxustus</i> (made of the inner part of the split hide), on the side which had been nearer the hair. If, on a <i>Kelaf,</i> one writes on the side that had been next to the hair, or, on a <i>Gewil or Duxustus,</i> one writes on the side that had been next to the flesh, the Scroll, <i>Tephillin</i> or <i>Mezuzah</i> so written is unfit for use."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.9","9. Though this is the rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai, yet if one writes a scroll of the Law on parchment made from the exterior half of a split hide it is fit for use. The reason why a complete hide is mentioned is in order to exclude that made from the inner half of the split hide. If one wrote on it a scroll of the Law, it is unfit for use. So also, if one wrote a <i>Mezuzah</i> on the external half of a split hide or on an undivided hide, the <i>Mezuzah</i> is fit for use. The inner half of a split hide is recommended to be used, only as a <i>Mitzvah</i> (specially approved)."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.10","10. Scrolls, <i>Tephillin,</i> and <i>Mezuzahs</i> are not written on the hide of a domestic or wild beast that is unclean or on the skin of an unclean bird. They are written on the hides of domestic or wild beasts that are clean or on the skins of clean birds, even when the flesh of these animals may not be eaten owing to their not having been slaughtered according to the ritual or being found to have suffered from a lesion of a mortal character. Nor are Scrolls, <i>Tephillin</i> and <i>Mezuzahs</i> written on the skin of a fish, even if it be of a clean species, because of its foulness. For this is not removed by tanning."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.11","11. The undivided skin for a scroll of the Law, and the external half of the hide to be used for <i>Tephillin</i> or for a scroll of the Law must be tanned for their specific purposes. If they were not expressly so tanned, they are not fit for use. Accordingly, if a non-Israelite or a Samaritan tanned them, they are unfit for use. Even if the Samaritan was instructed to tan a particular hide for the purpose of its being used for a scroll of the Law or <i>Tephillin,</i> it is unfit for use; since he works with his own purposes in mind, not with those of his employer. Hence, anything that has to be done with a purpose in mind, if done by a Samaritan, is unfit for use. The skin for a <i>Mezuzah</i> does not require to be tanned for that express purpose."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.12","12. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that a scroll of the Law or <i>Mezuzah</i> may only be written on parchment that is ruled. Phylacteries need not be ruled, because they are covered. So too, phylacteries and a <i>Mezuzah</i> may be written from memory, as these sections are recited by and are familiar to everyone. But not a single letter may be written in a scroll of the Law, except from a written copy of the text."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.13","13. A scroll of the Law, <i>Tephillin,</i> or <i>Mezuzoth</i> written by a heretic must be burnt. If written by a Samaritan, by a Jew converted to another faith, by one who surrenders Israelites to tyrants, by a slave, woman or minor, they are unfit for use, and must be hidden; for it is said, ""And thou shalt bind them"", ""And thou shalt write them"". The implication is that only that person is qualified to write them, who is charged with the duty of putting on <i>Tephillin</i> and believes in the obligation. If they are found in the possession of a heretic, and it is not known who wrote them, they should be hidden. If found in the possession of a Samaritan or non-Israelite, they are fit to be used. Scrolls of the Law, <i>Tephillin</i> and <i>Mezuzoth</i> are not to be bought from non-Israelites for more than their value, so as not to accustom the latter to steal these holy articles or take them by force."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.14","14. A scroll of the Law, phylacteries or <i>Mezuzoth,</i> written on the skin of a beast or bird—whether domestic or wild—which belongs to an unclean species, or written on skins that have not been tanned, and likewise a scroll of the Law or phylacteries written on skins not expressly tanned for those purposes, are unfit for use."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.15","15. If one who writes a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a <i>Mezuzah,</i> had not concentrated his mind while writing, and wrote one of the Names of God without express intent, these articles are unfit for use. Accordingly, when one is writing the name of God, even if an Israelite king greets him, he must not return the greeting. If he is writing two or three names of God, he may pause between writing one and writing the others and may respond."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.16","16. After dipping the pen in ink to write the Name of God, the scribe does not start with a letter of the name but with a letter of the previous word. If he altogether forgot to write the name of God, he writes it above the line. But to write part of the name on the line and part above the line makes the scroll unfit for use. Other words that the scribe forgot to write may be written partly on the line and partly above it. These rules apply to a scroll of the Law. But in a <i>Mezuzah</i> or in phylacteries not a letter may be written above the line. If the scribe forgot even one letter, he must hide what he wrote and write a fresh slip. In all of them (Scrolls of the Law, <i>Mezuzoth</i> and Phylacteries) it is permissible to write the name of God upon a surface from which writing has been erased or obliterated."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.17","17. Scribes of scrolls, phylacteries and <i>Mezuzoth</i> are forbidden to turn over the parchment sheet with its written surface beneath touching the board on which it lies, but should cover it with a cloth or fold it."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.18","18. If, after a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a <i>Mezuzah</i> had passed out of the scribe's hands, he makes the statement, ""I did not write the name of God in them with that purpose distinctly in mind"", he is not believed to the extent of rendering them unfit for use, but his statement is accepted so far that he forfeits his entire remuneration. The reason why he is not believed so as to render them unfit for use is because his motive may possibly have been to cause a loss to the person who bought or hired them. It would seem however that his statement would only cause him to forfeit that quota of remuneration to which the writing of the names of God would entitle him. Hence, if he stated, ""the skins of this scroll of the Law or of these phylacteries were not expressly tanned for those purposes"", then since in such a case he is believed so fully that he forfeits the whole of his remuneration, his statement is also credited so as to disqualify the articles from being used—it being a matter of general knowledge that if the skins had not been expressly tanned for the purpose of being made into phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, the scribe receives no remuneration whatsoever."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.19","19. Phylacteries and <i>Mezuzoth</i> may only be written in square Hebrew script. Permission was also given to write scrolls of the Law in Greek characters but not in those of any other foreign tongue. The ancient Greek script has gone out of use, been corrupted and become obsolete. Hence, at the present day, all three religious articles,—Scroll of the Law, Tephillin and Mezuzah,—are only written in the square Hebrew script. Care must be taken in writing that no letter shall adhere to any other letter; for any letter which is not completely surrounded on all four sides by a blank space of parchment has been improperly written. Any letter that cannot be read by a child of ordinary intelligence—not particularly bright or dull—is improperly written. Thus a <i>Yod</i> must not be like a <i>Vav</i> nor a <i>Vav</i> like a <i>Yod,</i> nor a <i>Koph</i> like a <i>Beth,</i> nor a <i>Beth</i> like a <i>Koph,</i> nor a <i>Daleth</i> like a <i>Resh,</i> nor a <i>Resh</i> like a <i>Daleth,</i> etc., so that the reader may be able to read fluently."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.1.20","20. If the parchment was perforated, the scribe must not write on the perforation. A perforation over which the ink passes is not regarded as a perforation, and it is permitted to write across it. Hence, it is permitted to write on the skin of a bird that has been tanned. Should the parchment have become perforated, after it has been written on, if the perforation is in the interior of a letter, as, for example, in a <i>Hé</i> or <i>Mem,</i> etc., it is regarded as properly written. Should one of the sides of a letter have been perforated, so that the letter is divided—then the rule is that if there is left of the part that is unperforated as much as would form a small letter, it is regarded as properly written, provided that it does not resemble a different letter. If the part that is left unperforated is not as much as would form a small letter, it is not regarded as properly written."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.2.1","1. How are the sections in the phylactery that is placed on the head to be written? The four sections are respectively written on four separate slips of parchment; each slip is rolled up separately and they are then placed in four compartments composed of one skin. As to the phylactery placed on the arm, these four sections are written in four columns on one slip of parchment. This slip is rolled up like a scroll of the Law from the last column to the first and is placed in one [leather] compartment."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.2.2","2. The scribe must exercise care in writing these sections, for if he wrote a closed section as an open one,<xref rid=""fn57"">*</xref> or wrote an open section as if it were closed, the slip is unfit for use. The first three sections are, all of them, open. The last section, that beginning, ""And it shall come to pass, if ye will hearken diligently"" (Deuteronomy 11:13) is closed."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.2.3","3. He must exercise care in regard to the words that are <i>plene</i> or <i>defective</i>,<xref rid=""fn58"">**</xref> that all the four sections should be written as they are in an examined scroll of the Law. For if he wrote a word <i>plene</i> that should have been written <i>defective,</i> the slip is unfit for use till the superfluous letter has been obliterated. If a word that is <i>plene</i> has been written <i>defective,</i> the slip is unfit for use and cannot be made good. The following is the list of the words in these four sections that are <i>plene</i> and <i>defective</i> respectively."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.2.4","[<i>For paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 (lists of</i> plene <i>and</i> defective <i>words), see the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 121b and 122a</i>.]"
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.2.5",6. The <i>Ayin</i> of Shema and <i>Daleth</i> of <i>Echad</i> (Deuteronomy 6:4) are to be written in larger type.
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.2.6","8. He must pay attention to the ""crowns"" (tittles) above the letters. These are like an upright <i>Zayin</i> and are placed on each letter to which such a crown belongs as written in the scroll of the Law. The following are the letters in the four sections thus ornamented:"
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.2.7","9. In the first section, there is only one such letter, namely the closed <i>Mem</i> in Meeyamim which has over it three <i>Zain</i>-shaped lines. In the second section, there are five letters, each of them a <i>Hé;</i> and on each, there are four <i>zain</i>-shaped lines. These are the <i>Hé</i> in Unesanah; the first and the last <i>Hé</i> in Hikshah; the <i>Hé</i> in Vayaharog; the <i>Hé</i> in Yadchah."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.2.8","10. The third section has five such letters. The <i>Koof</i> in Uvekoomecha has over it three <i>zain</i>-shaped lines; the <i>Koof</i> in Ukeshartam has over it three <i>zain</i>-shaped lines; the two letters <i>Teth,</i> and the letter <i>Pé</i> in Letotaphoth have on each of them four <i>zain</i>-shaped lines."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.2.9","11. The fourth section has five such letters. The <i>Pé</i> of Veasaphta has above it three <i>zain</i>-shaped lines. The <i>Tav</i> of Veasaphta has one <i>zain</i>-shaped line. The two letters <i>Teth</i> and the letter <i>Pé</i> in Letotaphoth have on each of them four <i>zain</i>-shaped lines. Altogether, the letters thus ornamented are sixteen. If the scribe wholly omitted these ornaments, added to them or omitted them over some of the letters, he has not rendered the phylacteries unfit for use."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.2.10","12. If one buys phylacteries from one who is not a recognized expert, he has to examine them. If he bought from him one hundred parchment slips, he examines three slips, either two of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the arm or two slips of those in the phylacteries worn on the arm and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head. If he found all these three correct, a presumption is established in the vendor's favour, and all his phylacteries are fit for use and the rest need not be examined. If he bought them however in several bundles, this examination (of three slips) must take place in each bundle, there being a presumption that the several bundles came from different individuals."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.2.11","13. A man who wrote phylacteries with his own hand or purchased them from an expert or, having bought them of a non-expert, examined them and replaced them in their leather containers, need never re-examine them, even after the lapse of many years. As long as the leather container remains sound, the presumption that they are sound holds good. Nor is it apprehended that a letter has been obliterated or perforated. Hillel the Elder was wont to say, ""These phylacteries belonged to my mother's father."""
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.1","1. There are eight rules for the making of phylacteries; all of them are traditionally ascribed to Moses who received them on Sinai; hence the observance of all of them is indispensable. A variation from any of them renders the phylacteries unfit for use. The rules are as follows: The phylacteries (that is, the external leather containers) must be square; they are to be sewn in such a way as to retain the square shape; their diagonals must be those of a square so that all the angles shall be equal; the leather container of the phylactery for the head shall have the letter <i>Shin</i> embossed on the right and on the left side; each of the slips of parchment on which the sections from the Pentateuch are written is to be wrapt in a cover; this is to be tied with hair, and then the slips are placed in their respective compartments which are sewn up with sinews; a border with a fold open at both ends shall be made of the skin of the base for the strap to pass through freely; the straps shall be black, and have the special knot, that is known to all, in the shape of a <i>Daleth.</i>"
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.2","2. How is the phylactery for the head made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length, breadth and height. It is of no consequence however if the height is more than the breadth or less. What is essential is that the length and breadth shall be equal. Three grooves are cut in the block so that it is divided into four parts as in this figure <img src=""data:image/jpg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEBLAEsAAD/2wBDAAUDBAQEAwUEBAQFBQUGBwwIBwcHBw8LCwkMEQ8SEhEP

"">. A piece of leather is taken and soaked in water. The wooden block is put in it and the leather is inserted into each groove. While it is still damp, it is crinkled on both sides, to make a shape of the letter <i>Shin</i> with three lines on the right side of the wearer and with four lines on the left side."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.3","3. The leather is left on the wood till it dries; it is then slipped off from the wooden block, with the result that it has the shape of four compartments. The prescribed sections of Scripture written on slips of parchment are placed, one in each compartment. A portion of the leather is drawn round and beneath the cube (to form its base). This is sewn up at its four sides. A portion is left in this skin at the base for the strap to pass through as in a loop. This it is which is called the bridge."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.4","4. How are the phylacteries for the arm made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length and breadth. It is to be a finger-breadth in height, or a little more or less. The block is covered with wet leather which is left on till it dries. It is then removed, and in the place where the wood had been, a single slip of parchment on which the four prescribed sections of Scripture are written, is inserted. A portion of the leather is drawn round below and is sewn up at its four sides. Of this base a part is left to form a loop for the strap to pass through."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.5","5. What is the order in which the sections are placed in the phylactery for the head? The last section, that beginning, ""And it shall come to pass if ye will hearken diligently"" (Deuteronomy 11:13) is placed in the first compartment, to the right of the wearer; the section beginning, ""Hear O Israel"" (Deuteronomy 6:4) in the compartment adjacent to it; the section beginning, ""And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God will bring thee"" (Exodus 13:11), next to the one containing the section, ""Hear O Israel"", and the section beginning, ""Sanctify unto me every first born"" (Exodus 13:1) in the fourth compartment which would be to the left of the wearer of the phylactery; so that anyone facing the wearer and reading what is before him would read the sections in the right Scriptural order as in the annexed figure. If there<xref rid=""fn59"">*</xref> was a deviation from this order, the phylacteries are not fit for use."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.6","6. The sections for the phylactery for the arm are written in four columns on one long strip of parchment like a scroll of the Law, and in the order in which they are found in the Pentateuch as in the annexed figure.<xref rid=""fn60"">**</xref> If the scribe wrote them on four separate slips and placed them in one compartment, he has done what is required, and need not attach them to each other."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.7","7. When he rolls up the parchment slips containing the sections, for the phylacteries worn on the head or on the arm, he rolls them from the end to the beginning so that, if opened, each section can be read from the beginning to the end."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.8","8. When the slips are about to be placed in their respective compartments, they are wrapped in a cloth, over which they are fastened with hair. They are then deposited in their compartments. This hair must be that of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species; and may even be taken from animals which are <i>Nevelah</i><xref rid=""fn61"">***</xref> or <i>Terefah</i>.<xref rid=""fn62"">†</xref> The custom that has come into general use is to fasten the slips with hair taken from calves' tails."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.9","9. The leather receptacles of the phylacteries are only sewn with sinews of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species, and may be taken from animals of such species even if they are <i>Nevelah</i><xref rid=""fn63"">*</xref> or <i>Terefah</i>.<xref rid=""fn64"">**</xref> The sinews used are those found in the heel of the domestic or wild beast, which are white and tough. They are softened by pounding them with stones or similar substances, till they become like flax. They are spun and twined, and then used for sewing the phylacteries and the sheets of the scrolls of the Law."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.10","10. The receptacles are to be sewn in such a way as to preserve the square contour of the base. It is a broadly established rule that on each side, there are to be three stitches, making altogether twelve stitches, whether the phylactery is for the arm or for the head. If the scribe desires to make ten or fourteen stitches, he may do so. The stitch must pass through the leather on both sides."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.11","11. The grooves of the phylacteries for the head ought to extend to the base where the stitching is done. If the grooves are recognizable so that the four divisions clearly appear, the phylacteries are fit for use, even though the grooves do not extend to the base. If however the grooves are not recognizable, the phylacteries are unfit for use. Within each groove, above the leather, a thread or cord ought to be passed so as to separate the compartments from each other. The general custom is to draw through each of the three grooves a sinew of the same kind as those used for the stitches."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.12","12. How are the thongs fixed? A strip of leather is taken as wide as the length of a barley corn. If wider, it is fit for use. The length of the strap of the phylactery for the head should be sufficient to encircle the head, form the knot and leave enough for the straps on either side to reach to the navel or a little higher. The strap for the phylactery of the arm should be sufficiently long to encircle the forearm, form the knot, extend down to the middle finger, about which it is to be wound three times and then fastened. If the straps exceed in length the foregoing dimensions, they are also fit for use."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.13","13. The thong of the phylactery for the head is inserted in the loop open at both ends. It is measured to fit the wearer's head, and then tied in a rectangular knot like a <i>Daleth.</i> This knot, every scholar should learn how to make. It is impossible to teach its form by description; this can only be taught by ocular demonstration. In the case of the phylactery for the arm, the thong is tied in a knot in the shape of a <i>Yod.</i> The thong of the phylactery for the arm should move freely in the loop, so that the wearer can loosen or tighten it when he puts it on his arm."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.14","14. The thongs of the phylacteries, whether for the head or for the arm, must have their exterior surface black. This is a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. But the other side of the thongs, being close to the skin, are fit for use if they are green or white. They must not however be red, for if the thong were inadvertently turned, the color of its lower surface would subject the wearer to ignominy. The lower side of the thongs should not be otherwise in color than the base of the leather case containing the parchment slips. If the latter is green, the former should be green; if white, the former should be white. It is comely if the phylacteries are wholly black, namely, both the case containing the slips of parchment and the thongs."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.15","15. The leather which forms the receptacles of the phylacteries and its thongs is to be made from the hide of a domestic or wild quadruped or skin of a fowl that belongs to the clean species, and may even be taken from those of these species that are <i>Nevelah</i> and <i>Terefah.</i> If they were made of the skin or hide of unclean species, or if the phylacteries were covered with gold, the phylacteries are unfit for use. The leather for the thongs must be expressly tanned for their intended purpose to be thongs of phylacteries. The leather which forms the receptacles for the phylacteries need not be tanned. Even if it consists of raw hide it is fit for use. Many places have the custom to make them of raw hide."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.16","16. The receptacles of the phylacteries may not be prepared by any one but an Israelite; for the making of these is like the writing of the prescribed sections because of the letter <i>Shin</i> which is embossed on the phylactery for the head, as we have already stated. Hence, if a non-Israelite made or sewed the phylacteries, they are unfit for use. So too, whoever is disqualified from writing the prescribed sections for the phylacteries may not prepare them."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.17","17. The phylactery for the head may not be transformed into a phylactery for the arm, but the latter may be changed into the former; on the principle that an object may not be degraded from a higher to a lower sacred use. So too, the thong of the phylactery for the head may not be transferred to a phylactery for the arm. This rule only applies to phylacteries that had been worn. But with regard to phylacteries for the head that no one had ever worn, if it is desired to transform them into phylacteries for the arm, this may be done. How is this effected? It is covered with leather so that it appears as one receptacle. The phylactery may then be bound on the arm."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.18","18. In case the stitches of the phylacteries are broken, they become unfit for use if there are two broken stitches adjacent to each other, or three not adjacent. This rule applies to old phylacteries. New phylacteries are fit for use as long as they keep their surface unimpaired. The following would be called new. If, at the place where the stitches have given way, part of the leather is held in the hand so that the phylactery is suspended, and the leather is strong enough not to be further torn, such phylacteries would be regarded as new. If however the leather is not strong enough to bear the weight of the phylacteries so suspended, but would tear, such phylacteries are regarded as old."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.3.19","19. A thong that has become broken is not to be tied together nor sewn up; but it is to be removed, put away, and replaced by a new thong. The parts of the broken thong are unfit for use unless the length and breadth of the part is of the prescribed dimension or larger. Care should always be taken that the external surface of the thongs should be above, when the phylacteries are bound on the hand or round the head. End of the chapter."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.1","1. Where is the phylactery of the head placed? It is placed on that part of the crown of the head, where the hair adjacent to the forehead ends, and this is the place where an infant's brain pulsates (the fontanelle). The phylactery needs to be adjusted so that it lies in the centre of the forehead, in a line with the point between the eyes. The knot should be at the top of the back of the neck, which is the end of the skull."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.2","2. The phylactery of the hand is bound on the left arm over the biceps muscle which is the flesh that stands out on the upper arm that is intermediate between the shoulder-blade and forearm, so that when the upper arm is held close to the ribs, the phylactery will be opposite the heart and thus the precept will be fulfilled, ""And these words … shall be upon thine heart"" (Deuteronomy 6:6)."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.3","3. To lay the phylactery of the hand on the palm or that of the head on the forehead is the practice of the Sadducees. He who makes the phylactery round like a nut is not fulfilling the precept in any way. A left-handed person lays the phylactery on his right arm, used by him as his left. If one is ambidextrous, he lays it on his left arm, which is the same as the left arm of any other person. The places where the phylacteries are respectively bound and laid are known by tradition."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.4","4. The lack of a phylactery for the head does not preclude one from putting on that of the hand, nor does the lack of a phylactery of the hand preclude one from putting on that for the head. Each is a duty separate and independent. What blessings are recited? For the phylactery of the head, the formula is as follows: ""Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and given us a command concerning the precept of phylacteries"". For that of the hand, the form is as follows: ""Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to lay the phylacteries""."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.5","5. This rule applies to the case where a person puts on one phylactery only. But when one lays both phylacteries, he recites one blessing, namely, the form, ""And hast commanded us to lay the phylacteries"", binds the phylactery on his arm, and then puts on that for the head. When they are removed, that on the head is removed first, and afterwards that on the arm."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.6","6. When a person has recited the blessing, ""Who hast commanded us to lay phylacteries"", and bound the phylactery on his arm, he is forbidden to converse, even to the extent of acknowledging his master's greeting, till he has put on the phylactery of the head. If he conversed he has committed a transgression; and when putting on the phylactery for the head, he must recite another blessing, viz: the form, ""Who hast given us a command concerning the precept of the phylacteries"", and then he puts on the phylactery for the head."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.7","7. On each occasion when one puts on phylacteries, the blessing is recited, even if they are removed and put on again several times in the day. It is a universal rule with regard to religious precepts that the appropriate blessings are recited prior to their performance. Hence too, the blessing for the phylactery of the hand has to be recited after it is placed on the biceps muscle before the thong is tightened, for the fastening constitutes the fulfillment of the precept."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.8","8. When a person removes his phylacteries, and puts them in a bag, he should not place the phylactery of the hand beneath and that for the head above it, because when he will again have occasion to put them on, he will come into contact with the phylactery of the head first, will thus be under the necessity of putting it down and take out the phylactery of the hand, the former not being put on before the latter. It is forbidden to leave a precept and pass on to the fulfillment of another religious duty, the rule being that the duty that first presents itself should first engage our attention. Hence, the phylactery for the hand should be placed above so that one may come into contact with it first, and the phylacteries be put on in the right order."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.9","9. A bag expressly intended to contain phylacteries and into which these have been placed, becomes consecrated and may not be put to secular use. If the bag was intended for this express purpose of containing phylacteries but had never contained them, or if phylacteries had been casually placed in a bag not set aside for that use, it does not become sacred, and continues to be a secular object as it had been hitherto. Phylacteries may not be suspended by their thong or by the part which contains the scriptural section. But the bag containing the phylacteries may be suspended."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.10","10. The proper time for putting on phylacteries is when it is day and not when it is night, for it is said, ""Day by day""<xref rid=""fn65"">*</xref> (Exodus 13:10). ""The ordinance"" mentioned in this verse refers to the precept of phylacteries. So it is said, ""And it shall be for a sign"", while Sabbaths and festivals are them-also, Sabbaths and festivals are not seasons for putting on phylacteries, for selves a sign. When is the proper time in the day to put on phylacteries? At the hour when a person can see his neighbour at a distance of four cubits and recognize him. The period extends till sunset."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.11","11. A person who put on phylacteries before sunset, is permitted when it becomes dusk, to continue to wear them, even throughout the night. The multitude however is not to be so taught. Everyone should be instructed not to wear phylacteries at night, but to remove them at sunset. Whoever deliberately puts on phylacteries after sunset, violates a prohibition, for it is said, ""And thou shalt keep this ordinance in its season, day by day"" (Exodus 13:10)."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.12","12. If the sun sets while a man with the phylacteries on his head was on the road, he places his hand upon the phylactery till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If Sabbath or a festival arrived while he was sitting in the house of study, with the phylactery on his head, he places his hand upon it till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If there is a house near the City Wall,<xref rid=""fn66"">*</xref> where the phylacteries could be safely left, he should leave them there. If he did not remove them after sunset, because he had no place where they would be safe, and he kept them on for the sake of security, his conduct is lawful."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.13","13. One who is exempt from reading the <i>Shema</i> is exempt from putting on phylacteries. If a child less than thirteen years of age knows how to take care of his phylacteries, his father purchases a set for him, so as to train him in the practice of religious precepts. Those who suffer intestinal troubles or have difficulty in controlling their sphincters are exempt from the obligation of putting on phylacteries. All who are ritually unclean are under the same obligation of putting on phylacteries as those who are ritually clean. One, who is in pain or whose mind is not calm and composed is exempt from the duty of putting on phylacteries; for the wearer must not allow his consciousness of them to wander. Priests while engaged in the temple service, Levites during the recital of hymns in their appointed places, Israelites while they are in the Sanctuary, are exempt from the duties of reciting the prayers and putting on phylacteries."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.14","14. As long as one is wearing phylacteries, he should frequently touch them with his fingers, so as not to lose consciousness of them for a single moment. For their degree of sanctity is higher than that of the golden plate which the High Priest wore on his forehead. On the latter, the name of God was engraved once only, while the phylactery for the head contains the tetragrammaton twenty-one times, and the phylactery for the arm, an equal number of times."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.15","15. A requisite in wearing phylacteries is physical cleanliness. One should take care that no flatus escapes him while he has them on. Hence, he may not, while wearing them, indulge in regular sleep or even doze. But if they are covered with a cloth, he may doze, even while wearing them. How so? He places his head between his knees and dozes in a sitting posture. If his phylacteries were folded and held in his hand, the holder may even sleep in the regular way."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.16","16. No meal, unless it be of a casual character, may be eaten, while one wears phylacteries (without previous preparation). Before proceeding to a regular meal, he removes them, places them on the table, washes his hands, puts them on again, recites the blessing for food while he has them on."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.17","17. If one feels a call of nature while wearing phylacteries, he is not to deposit them, before entering the lavatory, in the crevices that open towards the public thoroughfare, lest passers-by may take them. How should he act? Even if he needs to relieve the bladder while he is at a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, he should remove the phylacteries, roll them up in his garment, as a scroll is rolled up, grasp them in his right hand opposite his heart, taking care that not a thong projects outside his hand as much as a hand breadth; then he enters, relieves himself, and, after having left, goes away to a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, and puts on his phylacteries."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.18",18. This rule only applies to the case of a permanent lavatory. But one may not enter an extemporized lavatory with phylacteries even rolled up. They should be removed and given to another person for safe keeping.
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.19","19. If one wearing phylacteries needed to go to the lavatory at eventide when there would be no more time to put them on again, he should not enter with the phylacteries rolled up in his garment, even to relieve his bladder, if the lavatory is a permanent one. How should he act? He should remove the phylacteries, place them in their bag which must be at least a hand breadth long, or even in a smaller bag provided it is not specially assigned as a receptable for phylacteries. This he keeps in his hand and enters. Thus, too, at night time, if he needs to visit the lavatory, he may put the phylacteries in a bag which he keeps in his hand when entering."

"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.21",21. Translation omitted.
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.22","22. One is permitted to put on phylacteries in that portion of a bathhouse where all are attired. In that portion where some are in their attire while others are nude, the phylacteries which one wears need not be removed, but they may not be put on. Where all are nude, the phylacteries must be removed, and needless to add, they may not be put on."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.23","23. A person should not walk in a cemetery with phylacteries on his head. When he is within a distance of four cubits from a corpse or a grave, the phylacteries are to be removed till he has passed on to a distance outside four cubits. Phylacteries must not be put on before one is decently covered and has put on his garments. If a person is carrying a burden on his head, he must remove the phylactery from his head, and may not put it on till he has removed the burden. Even a kerchief [alone] may not be put upon the head when one is wearing phylacteries. But he puts his cap over the phylactery."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.24","24. In a room where there are phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, marital intercourse may not take place, till these have been taken out, or placed in a receptacle which itself is enclosed in another receptacle not assigned to the use of phylacteries or a scroll of the Law. If the latter receptacle has been so assigned, and even if there be ten such receptacles, they are all regarded as one receptacle. If he placed the sacred articles in two receptacles, one within the other, they may be put for security under his pillow between the bolster and the coverlid—not however exactly beneath his head. This may be done even if his wife shares his couch."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.25","25. The sanctity of phylacteries is a high degree of sanctity. As long as phylacteries are on a man's head and arm, he is humble and God-fearing, is not drawn into frivolity and idle talk, does not dwell on evil thoughts but occupies his mind with thoughts of truth and righteousness. A man should therefore endeavour to wear phylacteries the whole day, this being the right way of fulfilling the precept. It is said of <i>Rav,</i> the disciple of our Sainted Teacher (R. Judah, the Prince), that throughout his life no one saw him, without Torah, Tzitzis (fringes on his garments) or phylacteries."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.4.26","26. Although the proper mode of fulfilling the precept is to wear phylacteries the whole day, it is especially a duty to do so during the recital of prayers. The sages say, ""Whoever reads the <i>Shema</i> without wearing phylacteries is regarded as testifying falsely in his own person.<xref rid=""fn67"">*</xref> Whoever does not wear phylacteries at all violates eight affirmative precepts, since in each of the four sections, the command is set forth to lay phylacteries on the head and on the arm. Whoever wears phylacteries regularly will be blessed with longevity, as it is said, 'The Lord is upon them: they shall live'"" (Isaiah 38:16)."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.5.1","1. How is the <i>Mezuzah</i><xref rid=""fn68"">**</xref> written? Two sections of the Pentateuch, those beginning, ""Hear, O Israel"" (Deuteronomy 6:4) and, ""And it shall come to pass"" (Deuteronomy 11:13) are written in a single column on one slip of parchment. A space of half a nail's breadth is left as a margin above and below the column. If the Pentateuchal sections were written in two or three columns, the <i>Mezuzah</i> is fit for use. They must not however be written in the shape of a tail (broad at the top line and gradually narrowing to a point), or of a circle, or of a tent (narrow at the top and broadening to the base). A <i>Mezuzah</i> written in any of these forms is unfit for use. If the text was written out of order, for example, if the second section was in front of the first, it is unfit for use. If it was written on two slips of parchment, even though these were sewn together, the <i>Mezuzah</i> is unfit for use. A Scroll of the Law that has become worn out or phylacteries that are worn out may not be used for a <i>Mezuzah.</i> Nor may margins cut off from a scroll of the Law be so used; for anything dedicated to a sacred purpose may not be degraded from a higher to a lower degree of sacredness."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.5.2","2. It is a <i>Mitzvah</i> (an act of piety) to separate the section beginning, ""Hear, O Israel"" from that beginning, ""And it shall come to pass"" by a ""closed"" space (blank of nine letters). If the division between the two sections was an ""open"" one (the second section beginning a new line), the <i>Mezuzah</i> is fit for use, as, in the Pentateuch, the second section does not immediately follow the first. Special heed should be paid to the tittles in the <i>Mezuzah.</i> The following are the tittles which are made in the <i>Mezuzah.</i>"
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.5.3","3. In the first section, there are seven letters, each of which should have above it three upright lines in the shape of the letter <i>Zain.</i> They are the <i>Shin</i> and <i>Ayin</i> in <i>Shema; Nun</i> in <i>Nafshecha;</i> the two <i>Zain</i> in <i>Mezuzoth;</i> the two <i>Teth</i> in <i>Totafoth.</i> The second section has six letters, each of which should have above it three <i>Zain</i>-shaped lines. They are the <i>Gimel</i> in <i>Degancha;</i> the two <i>Zain</i> in <i>Mezuzoth;</i> the two <i>Teth</i> in <i>Totafoth;</i> the <i>Tzadi</i> in <i>Ha-aretz.</i> If the tittles were omitted or if they are more or less than those specified, the <i>Mezuzah</i> has not been rendered unfit for use. But if it was written without the lines having been ruled, or if the scribe paid no heed to <i>plene</i> or <i>defective</i> letters, or if he added in the text even a single letter, the <i>Mezuzah</i> is unfit for use."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.5.4","4. It is a universal custom to write the word <i>Shaddai</i> (Almighty) on the other side of the <i>Mezuzah,</i> opposite the blank space between the two sections. As this word is written on the outside, the practice is unobjectionable. They, however, who write names of angels, holy names, a Biblical text or inscriptions usual on seals, within the <i>Mezuzah,</i> are among those who have no portion in the world to come. For these fools not only fail to fulfill the commandment but they treat an important precept that expresses the Unity of God, the love of Him, and His worship, as if it were an amulet to promote their own personal interests; for, according to their foolish minds, the <i>Mezuzah</i> is something that will secure for them advantage in the vanities of the world.<xref rid=""fn69"">*</xref>"
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.5.5","5. It is a <i>Mitzvah</i> (act of piety) to write <i>Al Ha-aretz</i> (the last two words) on the last line, either at the beginning or in the middle of the line. All the scribes follow the custom of writing the <i>Mezuzah</i> in twenty-two lines, and (the last two words) <i>Al Ha-aretz</i> at the commencement of the last line. The following are the words in order, which begin each of the lines: (See the Hebrew text on the corresponding right-hand side, page 127b.)"
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.5.6","6. When the <i>Mezuzah</i> is folded, it is rolled up from the end of the line to the beginning, so that anyone opening it is able to read it from the beginning to the end of the line. After it has been rolled up, it is placed in a cylinder of reed, wood or other material, which is attached to the doorpost with a nail; or else a cavity is hollowed out in the doorpost, into which the <i>Mezuzah</i> is inserted."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.5.7","7. Before one affixes it to the doorpost, he recites the blessing, ""Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us to affix the <i>Mezuzah"".</i> No blessing is recited at the time when it is written, because the affixing of it constitutes the fulfillment of the precept."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.5.8","8. If one suspended it on a staff, it is unfit, for this is not affixing it (to the doorpost). If one placed it behind the door, he has not fulfilled the precept. If he perforated the door and forced the <i>Mezuzah</i> into it like a nail, as a bolt is inserted in the staple-ring, it is unfit. If it was placed in a hollow of the doorpost at a depth of a hand-breadth, it is unfit. If one cut a stick, put a <i>Mezuzah</i> on it, attached this stick to other sticks and made of them all a doorpost, it is unfit, because the affixing of the <i>Mezuzah</i> preceded the erection of the doorpost."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.5.9","9. The <i>Mezuzah</i> of a private dwelling is examined once every seven years; that attached to a public building twice in the Jubilee (fifty years). The object is to ascertain whether a letter has been torn away or obliterated; because owing to the <i>Mezuzah</i> being affixed to walls, it is liable to decay."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.5.10","10. The fulfillment of the precept of the <i>Mezuzah</i> is incumbent upon all Israelites, including women and slaves (of Israelites). Children under the age of thirteen years are trained to affix the <i>Mezuzah</i> to their rooms. One who rents a dwelling outside the Holy Land, or lodges at an inn in the Holy Land is exempt from the obligation of affixing a <i>Mezuzah</i> for a period of thirty days after beginning his occupancy. But if one rents a home in the Holy Land, the duty of affixing a <i>Mezuzah</i> devolves immediately."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.5.11","11. If one lets a dwelling to another person, the duty devolves upon the lessee to bring a <i>Mezuzah</i> and attach it, even if he has to pay for doing so, for the precept of the <i>Mezuzah</i> is the personal obligation of the occupant and not an obligation attaching to the structure. When he surrenders possession, he must not, on quitting the premises, remove the Mezuzah. But if the owner is a non-Israelite, the Jewish tenant, when leaving, takes it away."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.6.1","1. There are ten conditions which must exist in a dwelling, to put the occupant under an obligation to affix a <i>Mezuzah.</i> If one of these is absent, he is exempt. These are as follows: The dwelling must have a superficial area of four cubits by four cubits or more; it must have two door-posts, a lintel, a roof and doors; the entrance should be ten hand-breadths high or more; it must be a secular (not a sacred) structure; it must have been erected for human occupancy, for honored use (not a lavatory), and built for permanent habitation."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.6.2","2. A dwelling, the superficial area of which is less than four cubits by four cubits does not require a <i>Mezuzah.</i> If its area is equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits, even if it is circular in shape or has five angles, or, needless to add, if its length is greater than its breadth, it requires a <i>Mezuzah,</i> provided that it covers an area equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.6.3","3. A porch, that is a place with three walls and a roof, even though it has two uprights on the fourth side does not need a <i>Mezuzah,</i> the uprights serving to support the roof and not as doorposts. Thus too, a roof without walls that rests on pillars on either side, even if it presents the appearance of a dwelling is exempt from the obligation of having a <i>Mezuzah,</i> on account of its having no doorposts—the pillars having been erected to support the roof."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.6.4","4. A dwelling with posts on either side (of the door), and in the place of the lintel an arch in the shape of a bow, requires a <i>Mezuzah,</i> provided that the posts are ten hand-breadths high or more. If they are not ten hand-breadths high, there is no such obligation, as the dwelling has no lintel."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.6.5","5. A dwelling without a roof does not require a <i>Mezuzah.</i> Where part of it is covered with a roof and part uncovered, it seems to me that if the portion over the entrance is roofed, the structure requires a <i>Mezuzah.</i> After the doors are set up, the <i>Mezuzah</i> is affixed."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.6.6","6. The Temple Mount, its chambers and courts, synagogues and houses of study which have no residences are exempt, because they are sacred. A village synagogue in which transients lodge requires a <i>Mezuzah.</i> So too, a city synagogue which has a dwelling house attached to it, requires a <i>Mezuzah.</i> None of the Temple entrances had a <i>Mezuzah</i> except the Gate of Nikanor, and the gate within that gate, and the entrance to the Chamber of Parhedrin, because this chamber was the High Priest's residence during his seven days of seclusion (prior to the Day of Atonement)."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.6.7","7. A hayloft, a cattle-shed, a wood store and a barn are exempted from the obligation of a <i>Mezuzah,</i> because of the phrase, ""thy house"" (in the text ""thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house""), which means a dwelling assigned to thy use and excludes the aforementioned and similar classes of buildings. Hence, a cattle-shed, where women stay adorning themselves, must have a <i>Mezuzah,</i> because it also serves as a human habitation. A lodge or porch—either rectangular or circular—leading to a garden, a garden and a sheepfold are exempt from the obligation of a <i>Mezuzah,</i> because they are not constructed to serve as residences. If dwellings requiring a <i>Mezuzah</i> open to these places, the latter must also have a <i>Mezuzah.</i>"
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.6.8","8. Hence, entrances, whether leading to courtyards or to passages, and gates of districts or cities, must each have a <i>Mezuzah,</i> because dwellings which require a <i>Mezuzah</i> open on to them. Even where ten rooms open one to the other, each requires a <i>Mezuzah,</i> just as the innermost room requires it. This is the reason for the rule that a gate opening from the garden to a courtyard requires a <i>Mezuzah.</i>"
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.6.9","9. A privy, bath-house, ritual bath-house, tannery and similar places are exempt from the obligation of a <i>Mezuzah</i> because they are not erected to serve as dwellings for honored use. The tabernacle for the feast of Tabernacles, and a room in a ship are exempt from the obligation of a <i>Mezuzah</i> because they are not made for permanent occupancy. Of two potter's booths, one leading to the other, the exterior is exempt from the obligation of a <i>Mezuzah,</i> because it is not permanent. Shops in market places are exempt, because they are not intended to be used as residences."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.6.10","10. A dwelling with several doors, although only one is regularly used for coming in and going out, must have a <i>Mezuzah</i> affixed to each door. A small door between a dwelling (below) and the attic needs a <i>Mezuzah.</i> Every room in a dwelling, even a room within a room, must have a <i>Mezuzah</i> at the entrance of the inner chamber, of the outer chamber and of the house, for they all serve the purpose of residence and are permanent."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.6.11","11. A door between a house of study or synagogue and a private house, if used habitually for entering and leaving, requires a <i>Mezuzah.</i> If a door is between two dwellings, the position of the hinge determines the side on which the <i>Mezuzah</i> is to be fixed. The side on which the hinge is visible is regarded as the dwelling in reference to which the position of the <i>Mezuzah</i> is decided."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.6.12","12. Where is the <i>Mezuzah</i> to be fixed? Within the width of the doorpost, a hand-breadth from the external edge at a height of a third of the elevation of the entrance, counting from the top. If placed higher it is fit in position, provided that it is a hand-breadth lower than the lintel. It should be fixed on the right side of one entering; if placed on the left side, it is unfit for use. A house owned by partners requires a <i>Mezuzah.</i>"
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.6.13","13. A person should pay heed to the precept of the <i>Mezuzah;</i> for it is an obligation perpetually binding upon all. Whenever one enters or leaves a home with the <i>Mezuzah</i> on the doorpost, he will be confronted with the Declaration of God's Unity, blessed be His holy name; and will remember the love due to God, and will be aroused from his slumbers and his foolish absorption in temporal vanities. He will realize that nothing endures to all eternity save knowledge of the Ruler of the Universe. This thought will immediately restore him to his right senses and he will walk in the paths of righteousness. Our ancient teachers said: He who has phylacteries on his head and arm, fringes on his garment and a Mezuzah on his door may be presumed not to sin, for he has many monitors—angels that save him from sinning, as it is said, (Psalms 34:8) ""The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them""."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.1","1. It is an affirmative precept binding upon every individual Israelite to write a scroll of the Law for his own use, as it is said, ""Now therefore write ye this Song for you"" (Deuteronomy 31:19). As the Torah is not written in separate sections, this text means, ""Write for yourselves the Torah in which this Song is contained."" Even if one's ancestors have left a person a scroll, it is a religious duty to write a scroll at his own expense. If he wrote it with his own hand, it is accounted to him as if he had received it from Sinai. If one does not know how to write a scroll, he should get others to write it for him. He who corrects a scroll, even a single letter of it, is regarded as if he had written it completely."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.2","2. A king has the duty of writing for himself another scroll of the Law, in his capacity as sovereign, in addition to the scroll which he owns in his private capacity, as it is said, ""And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law, etc."" (Deuteronomy 17:18). This copy is corrected by comparison with a scroll kept in the temple court, and under the authority of the Supreme Judicature. The scroll which the king had possessed when he was a private individual, he places in his archives. The one that he wrote or had written for him when he became king, should always be with him. If he goes to war, the scroll is to be with him. When he enters his home, it is to be with him. When he hears a cause (tries a case) it is to be with him. When he sits down to a meal, it is to be placed before him, as it is said, ""And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life"" (Deuteronomy 17:19)."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.3","3. If he possessed no scroll before he came to the throne, he has to write, after his accession, two scrolls of the law, one of which he places in his archives, while the other is to be always with him. It must never be away from him, except at night, or when he goes to the bath or the lavatory or lies down on his couch to sleep."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.4","4. A scroll of the Law that has been written without having been ruled, or that has been written partly on parchment made of whole hide and partly on that made of the inner half of split hide is unfit for use. It must be entirely written either on the former or on the latter. How is a scroll of the law to be written? The scribe is to use the correct script and it should also be exceedingly fine. Between one word and another, he is to leave the space of a small letter; between one letter and another (in the same word) the space of a hair's breadth; between one line and the next the space of a line. The length of each line is to be thirty letters, wide enough to write the word Le-Mi-Sh-Pe-Ch-O-S-E-Che-M<xref rid=""fn70"">*</xref> three times. This is to be the width of each column. No line shall be shorter, so that the column shall not look like an epistle. Nor should any line be wider so that the reader's eyes should not have to wander across the sheet."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.5","5. He should not diminish the size of the characters in order to leave a space between one paragraph and another. When he comes (at the end of a line) to a word of five letters, he must not write two within the column and three outside the column; but he is to write three letters within the column and two outside the column. If there is not enough space left at the end of the line to write three letters, he is to leave it blank and begin at the commencement of the next line."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.6","6. If at the end of a line, he has a word of two letters to write, he may not place it between the columns (that is, outside the column) but he writes it at the beginning of the next line. If, before the line is filled up, he has a word of ten letters, more or less, to write and there is not enough space left on the line to write it all within the column, if he is able to write half the word within the column and half outside the column, he may do so. If he cannot do this, he leaves the space blank and writes the word at the beginning of the next line."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.7","7. Between each book and the next, he leaves a space of four lines, no more and no less, blank without any writing, and starts the next book at the beginning of the fifth line. When completing the Torah, he is to finish it in the middle of the line at the end of the column. If several lines of the column would be left, he shortens the lines, so as to begin at the beginning of the last line of the column and not complete it, and also so plans the lines that the final words <i>Le-éné Chol Yisrael</i> (""in the sight of all Israel"") shall be in the middle of the line at the end of the column."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.8","8. He should pay careful attention to the letters that are written large or small, to the letters that are punctuated with dots above them, to the letters that are written differently to the others, such as the letter Pé and the letters that are curved, in the way the scribes have carried on the tradition. He is to pay attention to the tittles<xref rid=""fn71"">*</xref> and the number of them in each case—one letter having above it a single tittle, another having seven tittles. All the tittles have the shape of the letter <i>Zain</i> and are to be thin as a hair."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.9","9. All these provisoes are only stated in order that the duty of writing a scroll shall be observed in the most perfect way. If, however the scribe made changes in the method here set forth, was not careful in regard to the tittles, writing however all the letters correctly, or if he wrote the lines close together or far apart, extended the lines or shortened them—since he did not join any letter to another, omit aught or add aught, mar the form of any letter, nor make any variation in regard to which paragraphs should be open and which closed, the scroll is fit for use."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.10","10. There are other rules mentioned in the Talmud which the scribes observe as a tradition handed down from one to another. They are as follows: The number of lines in each column shall not be less than forty-eight and not more than sixty; the blank spaces between one section and another shall be such that nine letters, e.g., A She R, A She R, A She R, can be written in it. The five lines preceding the Song at the Red Sea (Exodus 14:28, 29, 30, 30, 31) shall begin respectively with the words <i>Habaim, Bayabashah, Hashem, Mes, Bemitzraim.</i> The five lines after it shall begin respectively with the words <i>Vatikach, Achareha, Sus, Vayetzëü, Vayavöü</i> (Exodus 15:20, 20, 21, 22, 23). The six lines before the Song of Moses beginning <i>Haazinu</i> (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) shall respectively commence with the words <i>Veaeedah, Acharé, Haderech, Beacharith, Lehacheeso, Kehal</i> (Deuteronomy 31:28, 29, 29, 29, 29, 30); and the five lines after the Song of Moses shall begin with the words <i>Vayabo, Ledabber, Asher, Hazoth, Asher</i> (Deuteronomy 32:44, 45, 46, 46, 47). All these points of observance are to enable us to fulfill the duty in the best way. Variations in these particulars do not render the scroll unfit for use."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.11","11. But if the scribe wrote <i>defective</i> a word that should be <i>plene</i> or vice versa; or a word traditionally pronounced differently to the way it is written, according to the traditional pronunciation, for example, if he wrote <i>Yishkevenoh</i> instead of <i>Yishgelenoh,</i> or <i>Oovatechorim</i> instead of <i>Oova-apolim,</i> etc.; or if he wrote an ""open"" section as if it were a closed section or vice versa; or if he wrote one of the Songs like the ordinary prose text, or an ordinary section in the form of one of the Songs, the scroll is unfit for use as a scroll of the Law. It has not the sacredness of a scroll of the Law, but is like any one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.12","12. A scroll of the Law, which has not been examined for correctness may not be kept longer than thirty days. It must either be corrected or segregated.<xref rid=""fn72"">*</xref> A scroll of the Law which has three errors in each column should be corrected. If there are four, it must be put away. If the greater portion has been found to be correct, and the remainder has four errors in each column, but there is even one column in this erroneous portion with less than four errors, corrections could be made."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.13","13. This rule only applies to cases where the scribe wrote <i>defective</i> words that should be written <i>plene</i> so that he would be under the necessity of inserting the letters that he forgot between the lines. But if he wrote <i>plene</i> words that are <i>defective,</i> even if every column contains several errors, he corrects them, as he only erases and does not have to insert letters between the lines."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.14","14. It is permitted to write the Pentateuch, each book in a separate scroll. These scrolls have not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law that is complete. One may not however write a scroll containing some sections. Such a scroll may not be written for a child's instruction. This is permitted, however, where there is the intention to complete the remainder of the book. If one wrote such a scroll with three words on each line, this is permitted."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.15","15. The Pentateuch, the Prophets and the Hagiography may be put together in one volume. In such a case, a space of four lines is left blank between each book of the Pentateuch and the next; a space of three lines between each of the major Prophets and the next; and a space of three lines between each of the twelve minor prophets and the next, so that he can, if he wishes, separate any book. The order of the prophetical books is as follows: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah, the Twelve Minor Prophets. The order of the books of the Hagiography is: Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel, Esther, Ezra, Chronicles."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.7.16","16. None of The Holy Scriptures may be written except on ruled lines, even if they are written on paper: Three words of Scripture may be written without ruling the line, but to write more is forbidden. A volume containing the Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiography has not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, but of a single book of the Pentateuch. The scroll which contains more than the entire Pentateuch is in the same class as that which contains less than the entire Pentateuch, on the principle that excess is similar to deficiency."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.8.1","1. The <i>open</i> section has two forms. If the previous section ended in the middle of a line, the scribe leaves the remainder of the line blank and commences the open section at the beginning of the next line. This only applies to the case where, after the conclusion of the previous section, there is left sufficient space on the line to write nine letters. But if the space left is less, or if the previous section was completed at the end of the line, the next line must be left blank, and the open section is begun at the commencement of the third line."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.8.2","2. A <i>closed</i> section has three forms. If the previous section ended within the line, the scribe leaves a blank space for the required dimension (enough to write nine letters) and begins the closed section at the end of the line, provided that there is a blank space between it and the preceding section. If the completion of the previous section did not leave space for the blank of the required breadth and for writing (at least) one word at the end of the line, the scribe should leave the remainder of the line blank, leave a little space at the beginning of the next line blank, and begin the closed section within the line. If the previous section ended at the close of the line, he leaves a blank space of the required breadth (nine letters), at the beginning of the next line, and begins to write the closed section within the line. Hence, you may say that an open section always begins within the line."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.8.3","3. A scroll which is inaccurate in regard to words that are written <i>plene</i> or <i>defective</i> can be made good by being corrected, as already explained. But if the scribe made a mistake in the spacing between the sections, and wrote an open section as if it were a closed section, or a closed section as if it were an open section or left a space where a section does not end, or continued writing without leaving a space where a section ends, or deviated from the form in which the Songs are written, in all these cases, the Scroll is unfit for use and there is no remedy except to remove the entire column in which the mistake occurs."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.8.4","4. As in all the scrolls I have seen, I noticed serious incorrectness in these regards, while authorities on the Massorah, who write treatises and compilations with the aim of pointing out the sections that are closed and those that are open, differ according to the variations in the scrolls on which they rely, I deemed it fit to write here a list of the sections which are closed and those which are open, as also the forms in which the Songs of the Pentateuch are written so that all the scrolls may be corrected from, and compared with them. The copy on which I relied is the well-known Egyptian codex which contains the twenty-four books of the Scriptures and which had been in Jerusalem for several years—used as the standard text for the examination of scrolls. Everyone relied upon it because it had been examined by Ben Asher who closely studied it for many years and examined it again whenever it was being copied. This codex was the text on which I relied in the scroll of the Law that I wrote according to the rules."

"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.8.21","See the Hebrew text on the right-hand side 136a, 136b and 137a as it should be written in the scroll. The English pages should be blank."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.8.22","Throughout the Torah, in the Songs as well as in the rest of the text, the scribe should aim to write all the letters of each word close together, taking care that no letter should be joined to another, and that no letter should be so far away from the next as to make the word seem two words. The interval between the letters in one word should be a hairbreadth. If the scribe wrote one letter so far apart from the other that it would appear to a child who is not familiar with the text like two words, the scroll is unfit for use till he makes the correction."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.1","1. The length of a scroll of the Law should not exceed the circumference, nor should the circumference exceed the length. What is a suitable length? Where parchment of a whole hide is used, six hand-breadths, that is twenty-four finger-breadths taking the thumb as the standard. Where the parchment of the external half of the hide is used, the length may be more or less than this dimension, provided only that the length is equal to the circumference. So also in the case of parchment of a whole hide, if the scribe made the length less than six hand-breadths and wrote in a small hand or longer than six handbreadths and spread out the writing so that the length of the column is equal to the circumference—this too is correct."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.2","2. The extent of the lower margin is four finger-breadths; of the upper margin, three finger-breadths; between one column and another, two finger-breadths. Hence, on the right and left of every sheet of parchment, the scribe has to leave a margin a finger-breadth wide and enough beside for sewing; so that, when the sheets are sewn together, there will be throughout the scroll a blank space of two finger-breadths between the columns. The scribe must leave in addition enough margin at the beginning and end of the scroll to fold a blank column round the rollers. All these dimensions are to be observed in order to fulfill the precept properly. But if the scribe exceeded or fell short of them, he does not render the scroll unfit for use."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.3","3. How shall one proceed so that the length of the scroll shall turn out equal to its circumference. The parchment sheets are made evenly rectangular; each sheet being six handbreadths wide, all of the same dimensions. They are rolled evenly into one bundle tightly rolled up. And skins are added and tightly rolled till the circumference is six handbreadths, which is the width of the sheets. This is measured with a thread of wool which is placed round the bundle."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.4","4. The scribe then fashions a straight ruler, forty or fifty finger-breadths long; one of these finger-breadths, he marks in two, three and four equal parts so as to be able to measure off a half, a third and a quarter of a finger-breadth and similar fractions. With this, he measures each sheet, so as to ascertain the number of finger-breadths it contains and so determine how many finger-breadths there are in the entire bundle."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.5","5. He then takes two or three other sheets of parchment, to test the size of the characters, and writes on them one column. The length of a column of writing is obviously seventeen finger-breadths as a margin must be left, of three finger-breadths above and four finger-breadths below. The width of the column will depend on the handwriting, whether it is large or small. So also, the number of lines will vary according to the handwriting, as between each line and the next, the space of a line must be left."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.6","6. Having written the column which he uses as a test as he pleases, he measures its breadth by means of the finger-breadths of the ruler, and adds two finger-breadths for the margin between column and column. He then calculates how many columns of such writing would fill the sheets in the bundle he had made up. Having ascertained the total number of columns, he will then see how much of the entire Pentateuch is in the column which he wrote as a test. He will make the estimate with the aid of the scroll which serves him as a copy, and calculate accordingly. If the number of columns of the kind of writing which he wrote is sufficient for the whole Torah—well and good. If the calculation showed that there are more columns than are required for the whole Torah, he will enlarge the writing, so as to diminish the number of columns, and he will make a test with another column. If the calculation shows that for the writing of the Torah more columns will be required than are contained in his sheets, he will use smaller characters and so secure a larger number of columns. He will make the test with column after column till the calculation comes out exact."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.7","7. Once he knows the width of the column and the size of the characters, he can begin writing the scroll with that bundle of sheets. He then divides the parchment (sheets) into columns by ruling them off,—each column of the same width as that which his tests and calculations showed to be the right size. If three or four finger-breadths are left over beyond the last column, he should leave one finger-breadth and enough besides for sewing the sheet to the next, and cut off the rest, and need feel no apprehension, for at the end, more sheets will be added to make up for the superfluous strips that he cut off from each sheet. Nor need he make any calculations in regard to this, for the writing will be according to the number of columns."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.8","8. So too, if one wishes to make the width of the scroll more or less than six handbreadths, he makes his calculation in the same way; and the length will be exactly equal to the circumference neither more nor less, provided that no mistake has been made in the calculation."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.9","9. The finger-breadth in all the dimensions here and in the rest of the Torah is that of the medium sized finger. On careful examination, we find it to be the breadth of seven medium sized barley corns placed close together, this being equal to the length of two barley corns measured liberally. The handbreadth, wherever mentioned, is equal to four such finger-breadths. A cubit is six handbreadths."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.10",10. The scroll which I wrote had a width of four finger-breadths to each column. The columns containing the Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15.1-18) <i>Haazinu</i> (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) were each six finger-breadths wide. The number of lines in each column were fifty-one. The number of columns in the whole scroll were 226 columns. The length of the entire scroll was 13366 finger-breadths approximately.
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.11","11. The six finger-breadths left over were for the margin at the beginning and end of the scroll. The parchment skins on which we wrote were ramskins. Whenever you desire to write a scroll and follow these measurements completely or approximately, you need not weary yourself to make a calculation if you have one, two or three columns less or more; you will find that the length will be equal to the circumference."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.12","12. No sheet should have less than three, nor more than eight columns. If a sheet is wide enough to contain nine columns, it is cut into two parts, one to contain four columns, the other to contain five columns. This rule applies to the beginning and middle of the scroll. But at the close, even if there is only left one verse to write on a column, that column is prepared on a separate sheet and sewn on to the other sheets."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.13","13. For sewing the sheets together, only the sinews of a clean beast domestic or wild, including those that are <i>Terefah</i><xref rid=""fn73"">*</xref> or <i>Nevelah</i>,<xref rid=""fn74"">**</xref> may be used. The law here is the same as in regard to phylacteries. This rule goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. Hence if the sheets have been sewn together but not with sinews or with sinews of an unclean animal, the scroll is unfit for use till the stitches are taken out and the sewing is done according to rule."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.14","14. When the sheets are sewn together, they are sewn entirely from top to bottom, but a small portion is left above and below without being stitched, so that the scroll, when it is rolled up, may not be torn in the middle. Two wooden rollers are prepared, one for either end. The unwritten margins of parchment at the beginning and at the end are brought round the rollers and sewn with sinews, so that the scroll can be rolled over them; a clear space being left between the margin and the writing in the columns."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.9.15","15. In case a scroll of the law had one of its sheets torn, the rent is sewn up, if it extends to two lines; if it extends to three lines, it is not sewn up. This rule applies to a scroll the gall dressing of which is no longer perceptible. But if the parchment still shows that it has been dressed, then, even when the rent extends to three lines, it is sewn up. So too, a rent between columns or between words is sewn up. For the stitching of the rents, the same kind of sinews are used as for the sheets. And wherever there is a rent, the scribe should make sure that no letter is missing or altered in form."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.1","1. You thus find that there are twenty factors, any one of which disqualifies a scroll of the law. If any of these occurs, the scroll is like one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught. It does not possess the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, and is not used for reading in public worship. They are as follows:"
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.2",1) If it was written on the skin of a beast of an unclean species;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.3","2) or on the skin of a beast of a clean species, which had not been tanned;"
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.4",3) If the skin had been tanned but not for the express purpose of being used as a scroll of the law;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.5","4) If it was written on the wrong side; in the case of parchment of whole hide on the side next to the flesh; in the case of parchment of the outer half of a split hide, on the side adjacent to the hair;"
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.6",5) If it was written partly on parchment of whole hide and partly on that made of the outer half of split hide;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.7",6) If it was written on the inner half of a split hide;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.8",7) If it was written without the lines having been previously ruled;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.9",8) If it was written with a dark writing fluid that does not make a permanent impression;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.10",9) If it was written in other languages;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.11",10) If it was written by a heretic (Epikouros) or other disqualified persons;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.12",11) If the scribe wrote the names of God without special concentration of mind;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.13",12) If a single letter was omitted;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.14",13) If a single letter was added;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.15",14) If one letter touched another;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.16","15)	If a single letter was so marred that it cannot be read at all, or resembles another letter, whether the defect is in the writing, or is due to a perforation, rent or smudge;"
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.17",16)	If the scribe wrote letters so far apart or so closely together that one word looks like two words or two words look like one word;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.18","17)	If he altered the form of the sections<xref rid=""fn75"">*</xref>;"
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.19",18)	If he varied the form of writing the Songs;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.20",19)	If he wrote any other portion in the form of a Song;
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.21",20)	If he did not sew the sheets with sinews of a beast of a clean species.
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.22",The other conditions stated are recommended as the best way of performing the duty of writing a scroll. Their non-observance does not render it unfit for use.
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.23","2. A scroll of the law that is fit for use is to be regarded as an object of extreme holiness and treated with great reverence. A person is forbidden to sell a scroll of the law even if he has nothing to eat, and even if he owns other scrolls. He may not even sell an old scroll, to buy a new one. A scroll may only be sold for one of two purposes, to provide means to enable one to study Torah or to marry—and then only if the owner has nothing else that he can sell."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.24","3. If a scroll of the law has become worn out or been otherwise rendered unfit for use; it is placed in an earthenware vessel and buried beside the remains of deceased scholars. This is the appropriate method of ""concealing"" it (putting it away). Folders of scrolls that have become worn out are used as shrouds for the dead (found on the road) whose interment is a duty binding on all. This is the appropriate method of ""concealing"" them."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.25","4. A case specially made for a scroll of the law and in which it has been placed, bands around the scrolls, the chest or structure in which it is deposited even though the scroll is in its case, as also a bench specially made on which to place a scroll of the law, and on which a scroll was placed are all subsidiaries of that which is sacred, and may not be thrown away. When worn out or broken, they are ""put away"". The platforms, however, on which the Reader of the congregation stands and holds the scroll and tablets on which (scriptures) are written for a child's instruction have no sanctity. Golden and silver pomegranates and other such ornaments, made for the embellishment of a scroll of the law are subsidiaries of that which is sacred; and it is forbidden to part with them to be used for secular purposes, unless they were sold with the intention to purchase with their proceeds a scroll of the law or a book of the Pentateuch."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.26","5. It is permitted to place one scroll of the law upon another scroll, or, needless to add, upon single books of the Pentateuch. Single books of the Pentateuch may be placed upon books of the Prophets or Hagiography. But the books of the prophets and of the Hagiography are not placed upon single books of the Pentateuch; nor the latter on a scroll of the law. No sacred writings, not even Halachas or Hagadas (Legalistic or Homiletic works) may be thrown away. Amulets which contain scriptural matter, must not be taken with one into a lavatory (privy) unless they are covered with a skin."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.27","6. A person may not, while bearing a scroll of the law in his arms, enter a bath-house, lavatory, or cemetery, even if the scroll is swathed in folders and placed in its case. A person must not read in it till he has moved away four cubits from the dead body (bath house) or lavatory. One may not hold a scroll of the law when nude. It is forbidden to sit down on a couch on which there is a scroll of the law."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.28","7. Cohabitation is forbidden in a chamber where there is a scroll of the law, till it has been removed or placed in a receptacle which is itself placed in a receptacle not specially assigned to the scroll. If it has however been so assigned, even ten receptacles within each other, are regarded as a single receptacle. If a partition, ten handbreadths high, has been constructed for the scroll, cohabitation may take place if there is no other room. It may not take place, if there is another room, till the scroll has been removed."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.29","8. All who are ritually unclean, even women in their menstruating period, and even a non-Israelite, may hold a scroll of the law and read in it, for the words of the Torah do not contract uncleanliness, provided that the holder's hands are not dirty or soiled. They must therefore wash their hands and then they may touch it."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.30","9. Every one who sees a person carrying a scroll of the law and proceeding with it must stand up before it; and all persons continue standing till the bearer of the scroll stops, having carried it to its appointed place, or passes out of sight. They are then permitted to resume their seats."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.31","10. It is a duty to assign a fixed place for a scroll of the law, and to show it extreme honor and courtesy. The words in the tables of the covenant are in every scroll of the law. One may not expectorate before a scroll of the law, nor indecently expose oneself before it, nor stretch out one's feet before it; nor place it upon the head in the way in which a burden is carried; nor turn one's back to it unless it is at an elevation of ten handbreadths above the person."
"Laws Concerning Phylacteries the Mezuzah and the Scroll of the Law,.10.32","11. If one is travelling from place to place and had a scroll of the law with him, he is not to put the scroll in a sack, place it on the donkey's back and ride upon it. If, however, he is afraid of thieves, he may do so. When there is no such apprehension, he places it in his bosom close to his heart, and continues his journey, riding. Any one, sitting before a scroll of the law, should be inspired with a sense of earnestness, awe and reverence, for it is a faithful witness concerning all who come into the world, as it is said, ""It shall be therefore a witness against thee"" (Deuteronomy 31:26). All possible honor should be shown it. The ancient sages said, ""Whoever treats the Torah with contumely will be treated with contumely by his fellow-creatures. Whoever honors the Torah, will receive honor from his fellow creatures"" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:8). End of the laws concerning the scroll of the Law by the Grace of God."
Laws of Reading the Shema.1.1,"1. The <i>Shema</i> is read twice every day,—in the evening and in the morning, as it is said, ""and when thou liest down and when thou risest up"" (Deuteronomy 6:7), the phrases in this text meaning at the time when men are lying down, that is, at night, and at the time when they have risen, that is, by day."
Laws of Reading the Shema.1.2,"2. What does one read? Three sections as follows: the section beginning, ""Hear, O Israel"" (Deuteronomy 6:4-9); that commencing, ""And it shall come to pass"" (Deuteronomy 11:13-21); and that commencing, ""And the Lord spoke"" (Numbers 15:37-41). The section beginning, ""Hear, O Israel"" is recited first, because it sets forth the duties of acknowledging the Unity of God, loving Him, and studying His words. This is the great and essential matter on which all depends. Then, the passage beginning, ""And it shall come to pass"" is read, this containing a charge to fulfill all the other commandments. Finally the section concerning Fringes is read, as it also contains a charge to remember all the commandments."
Laws of Reading the Shema.1.3,"3. Although the precept to wear fringes is not incumbent at night, still the section concerning this precept is recited at night, because it mentions the departure from Egypt, which it is a duty to recall by day and at night, as it is said, ""that thou mayest remember the day of thy going forth from the land of Egypt all the days of thy life"" (Deuteronomy 16:3). The reading of these three sections in this order is termed ""The reading of the <i>Shema</i>."""
Laws of Reading the Shema.1.4,"4. When reciting the <i>Shema,</i> after concluding the first verse, one repeats in a low tone the sentence, ""Blessed be the name of His glorious sovereignty for ever and ever"" and then resumes the reading of the first section in the regular order from the verse, ""And thou shalt love the Lord, thy God,…""to the end of the section. Why is the sentence above mentioned interpolated? We have a tradition that when the patriarch Jacob, residing in Egypt, gathered his sons about him, in his dying hour, he earnestly charged them concerning the Unity of God and the Way of the Lord in which Abraham and his father Isaac had walked. He questioned them, saying to them, ""Possibly, my sons, there is some one among you who is unworthy, and is not at one with me on the doctrine of the Unity of the Creator of the World,"" in the same way as our teacher Moses charged the people in the words, ""Lest there be among you a man or a woman … whose heart turneth away this day"" (Deuteronomy 29:17). They all answered, ""Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one."" This means, ""Our father, Israel, hear this, our [confession of faith]: 'the Lord our God is one Lord'"". The aged patriarch then ejaculated, ""Blessed be the name of His glorious Sovereignty for ever and ever."" Hence, all Israelites keep the custom of reciting, after the first verse of the <i>Shema,</i> the thanksgiving uttered by the Patriarch Israel."
Laws of Reading the Shema.1.5,"5. Blessings are recited before the <i>Shema</i> and after it. When reading the <i>Shema</i> by day, two blessings are recited before it, and one after it. When reading it at night, two blessings are recited before, and two after it."
Laws of Reading the Shema.1.6,"6. The former of the two blessings recited before the <i>Shema</i> by day, is that beginning, ""Who formest light and createst darkness."" The latter is that beginning, ""With everlasting love hast Thou loved us."" The blessing subsequent to the <i>Shema</i> is that beginning, ""True and Firm."" The former of the two blessings recited <i>before</i> the <i>Shema</i> at night is that beginning, ""Who bringest on the evening twilight."" The latter begins ""With everlasting love hast Thou loved Thy people Israel."" The former of the blessings, recited <i>after</i> it, is that beginning, ""True and trustworthy."" The latter, that beginning, ""Cause us to lie down [O Lord, our God, in peace.""]"
Laws of Reading the Shema.1.7,"7. The first of the blessings recited before the Shema, whether by day or at night, is introduced with the formula, ""Blessed [art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe]"" and concludes with the formula, ""Blessed [art Thou, O Lord]."" Of the other blessings, each concludes with the formula, ""Blessed [art Thou, O Lord]"" but are not introduced with the formula, ""Blessed art Thou …"" These blessings as well as all the other blessings with which all Israel are familiar were instituted by Ezra and his court and no one is permitted to take aught away from the wording or add to it. The blessings which they (Ezra and his colleagues) ordained to conclude with the formula, ""Blessed [art Thou etc.]"" may not be recited without this formula. Those which they ordained should conclude without this formula may not be recited with it. Those which they ordained not to begin with a benedictory formula, may not be begun with it. Those which they ordained should begin with it may not be begun without it. In short, whoever alters the form the Sages gave to the blessings commits an error and must recite the blessing again according to its prescribed form. Whoever does not recite the blessing beginning, ""True and firm"" in the morning, and that beginning, ""True and trustworthy"" in the evening has not fulfilled his duty."
Laws of Reading the Shema.1.8,"8. If one has recited the second blessing before the first, either in the Morning or in the Evening Service, and whether the blessings thus transposed are those recited before or after the <i>Shema,</i> he has fulfilled his duty; for no order has been statutorily fixed for the blessings. If, in the morning service, one began the first blessing with the formula, ""Who createst light"" and concluded it with the formula, ""Who bringest on the evening twilight,"" he has not fulfilled his duty. But if one began with the formula, ""who bringest on the evening twilight"" and concluded with the formula, ""who createst light"" he has fulfilled his duty. Thus too, in the evening service, if one began with the formula, ""who bringest on the evening twilight"" and concluded with the formula, ""who createst light"" he has not fulfilled his duty; but if one began with the formula, ""who createst light"" and concluded with the formula, ""who bringest on the evening twilight"" he has fulfilled his duty; for the essential element in all Blessings is the Conclusion."
Laws of Reading the Shema.1.9,"9. When is the time for reading the <i>Shema</i>? In the evening, the duty is correctly performed if it is read at any time from the first appearance of the stars till midnight. If one however transgressed and delayed, but read the Shema before daybreak, he has discharged the obligation. The Sages fixed midnight as the limit only in order to prevent complete violation."
Laws of Reading the Shema.1.10,"10. One who reads the Evening Shema after dawn but before sunrise has not discharged his obligation, unless he had been unavoidably prevented from reading it earlier, as, for instance, if he had been inebriated or sick, etc. Anyone who unavoidably delays reading the <i>Shema</i> till this time does not recite the Blessing beginning, ""Cause us to lie down in peace."""
Laws of Reading the Shema.1.11,"11. When is the right time for reading the <i>Shema</i> by day? To observe the precept properly, one should begin reading it before sunrise, so as to conclude the recital of the Blessing after the Shema exactly at sunrise. This interval is about a tenth of an hour before the Sun rises. One who deferred reading the Shema till the Sun had risen, has discharged his obligation—the period for reading the Shema being extended, for one who delayed, to the end of the first three hours of the day."
Laws of Reading the Shema.1.12,"12. If one anticipated the hour and read the Shema of the Morning Service after dawn, he has fulfilled his duty, even if he concluded it before sunrise. In case of urgency, as for instance, when one has risen early in order to set out on a journey, he may deliberately read it before dawn."
Laws of Reading the Shema.1.13,"13. If one reads the <i>Shema</i> after the first three hours of the day are gone, even though he had been unavoidably prevented from doing so earlier, he has not fulfilled the duty of reading the Shema at the right time. He is in the same category with one who reads the <i>Torah.</i> Still he recites the blessings that precede and follow it, at any part of the day, even if he delayed the reading till after the first three hours of the morning had elapsed."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.1,"1. One who reads the <i>Shema</i> and does not concentrate his mind while reciting the first verse—""Hear, O Israel, the Lord, our God, the Lord is One,"" has not fulfilled his duty. As to the remaining verses, if he did not concentrate his mind (while reciting them), he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty. Even if he was reading the Torah in his usual course of study or examining these sections in a scroll (to ensure correctness), and read them at the prescribed time, he has fulfilled his duty, provided however that he concentrated his mind while reciting the First Verse."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.2,"2. Everyone may read the <i>Shema</i> in the ordinary postures—standing, walking, lying down or riding on an animal. It is forbidden to read the Shema, lying down prone with face to the ground, or lying on the back with face looking up. But one may read it while lying on one's side. An extremely corpulent person who is unable to turn on his side or one who is sick should slightly turn on his side and then recite the <i>Shema.</i>"
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.3,"3. A traveller, journeying on foot, must stand while reciting the first verse. The remaining verses he may read walking. A person who is asleep should be aroused when the time comes for reading the Shema, and kept awake till he has read the first verse. If after that, he is overcome by drowsiness and falls asleep, he is not to be disturbed."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.4,"4. A person, engaged in work at the time, pauses till he has read the whole of the first section. So also, artizans intermit their tasks while reciting the first section, so that their reading of the Shema shall not be perfunctory. The rest of the <i>Shema,</i> everyone reads, continuing his task in the meanwhile. Even if one is standing on the top of a tree or on a wall, he reads the <i>Shema</i> in that place, reciting there also the preceding and succeeding blessings."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.5,"5. If one was engaged in the study of the Torah and the time has come to read the <i>Shema,</i> he intermits his study, reads the <i>Shema</i> and recites the blessings before and after it. If one was engaged in public duties, he should not stop but complete them, and then read the <i>Shema</i> if there is still time to do so."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.6,"6. If one was eating, bathing, trimming his hair, turning hides in a tannery or hearing a trial in court, he finishes the matter in hand and then recites the <i>Shema.</i> If, fearing that the time for reading the <i>Shema</i> might pass, he interrupted the work on which he was engaged and read the <i>Shema,</i> he is accounted praiseworthy."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.7,"7. If one who had gone to take a ritual bath has time to come up from the bath and dress before the sun rises, he should do so and recite the <i>Shema.</i> If he feared that the sun would have risen before he was ready, he should immerse his body in the water in which he is standing and read the <i>Shema.</i> He must not do so in water so foul that it has a bad odor, nor in water that has been used for soaking flax nor in water that is so clear that the lower part of his body would be visible. But he may immerse his body in turbid water that has no offensive odor and read the <i>Shema</i> in the place where he stands."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.8,"8. While reading the <i>Shema,</i> one must not wink with the eyes, signal with the lips, or point with the fingers, so that his recital shall not be perfunctory. If he did any of these things, he has, though fulfilling his duty, been guilty of unbecoming conduct. A person should read the <i>Shema</i> so that the words are audible to himself. If he has not done so, he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty. He should enunciate the letters distinctly. If he has not done so, he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.9,9. How should care be exercised in enunciation?
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.10,"One should take heed not to sound a letter with a strong <i>Dagesh</i> as if it were without such a <i>Dagesh,</i> nor a letter without a strong Dagesh as though it had such a Dagesh; nor sound a letter with a <i>Sheva mobile</i> as if it were immobile, nor, vice versa, sound a letter with a <i>Sheva immobile</i> as if it were mobile. Hence also, a pause should be made between two words, where the first of the two words ends with the letter with which the one immediately following it begins. For example, in reading the words <i>Bechol levavcha,</i> a pause should be made after the word <i>Bechol,</i> before reading <i>levavcha.</i> The same practice should be observed in the case of <i>Va-avadtem meherah</i> and <i>Hacanaf pesil;</i> so too the <i>zain</i> in <i>tizkeru</i> should be pronounced distinctly. One should dwell on the <i>Daleth</i> in <i>Ehad</i> a sufficiently long interval to enable one to acclaim God as Sovereign in Heaven and on Earth and towards the four cardinal points of the compass. The <i>Heth</i> in <i>Ehad</i> should not be pronounced hurriedly, for then the word would sound <i>Ee had</i><sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*Not one.</i>."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.11,"10. A person may recite the <i>Shema</i> in any language that he understands. And if one reads the <i>Shema</i> in a secular language, he must take care to avoid errors in that language, and be as scrupulous in correctly enunciating the Shema in that language as he would be if he were reading it in the Sacred Tongue."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.12,"11. One who reads the <i>Shema,</i> but not in the correct sequence has not fulfilled his duty. This only refers to the recital of the verses out of their correct order. But if one reads a later section before the one that should have preceded it, though this is not permissible, still, in my opinion, he has fulfilled his duty, on the ground that these sections do not immediately follow each other in the Torah. To recite a verse and then reiterate it is unseemly. But if one reads a word and then repeats it, for instance, if one reads <i>Shema, Shema,</i> he is silenced."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.13,"12. One who reads the <i>Shema</i> but not continuously, has done his duty, even if he paused between the reading of one section and the next so long that he might have concluded the whole of it, provided that he reads the verses in the right order. If one reads the <i>Shema</i> when one is drowsy, not fully awake nor yet fast asleep, he has fulfilled his duty, provided that he is awake while reading the first verse."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.14,"13. If a person is in doubt whether he has read the <i>Shema</i> or not, he should read it again and recite the blessings that precede and follow it. But if one is certain that he read the <i>Shema</i> and is in doubt only whether he recited the blessings that precede and follow it, he should not read the blessings. If, while reading the <i>Shema,</i> he made a mistake, he should go back to the place where he had made the mistake. If between one section and another, he forgot and did not know which section he had completed and which he had to begin, he should go back to the first section, namely to the verse, ""Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God."""
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.15,"14. If one made a mistake in the middle of a section and does not know where he paused, he should return to the beginning of the section. If one recited the word <i>U-chesavtom</i> (""And thou shalt write them"") and is uncertain as to whether it is the word in the first, or in the second section, he is to return to this word in the first section. But if the doubt arises after he had already read the phrase <i>Lemaan Yirbu Yemechem</i> (""That your days may be multiplied"") he is not to go back, as it may be assumed that he has read regularly in the way his tongue is accustomed to do."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.16,"15. A person, while reading the <i>Shema,</i> met other people or was accosted by them. If at that moment, he had already concluded one section and not yet begun the next, he pauses and salutes anyone whom it is his duty to show honour to, e.g. a father, teacher, or superior in learning. And he returns the greeting of anyone who first saluted him."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.17,"16. If he was, at the time, in the middle of a section, he only pauses to salute one of whom he stands in awe, e.g. a king or a tyrannical individual, etc. And if one entitled to honour, e.g. a father or teacher, greets him first, he pauses to return the greeting."
Laws of Reading the Shema.2.18,"17. The divisions between the sections are as follows: Between the first blessing and the second; between the second blessing and the <i>Shema;</i> between the first section and second section of the <i>Shema;</i> between the second and third section of the <i>Shema.</i> One reading the <i>Shema,</i> when reaching these places, greets one whom it is his duty to honour, and acknowledges the greeting of anyone who first salutes him. But the conclusion of the third section and the opening words of the subsequent blessing are regarded as the middle of a section. One may only pause there either to salute a person of whom one stands in awe or to return the greetings of a person whom it is one's duty to honour."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.1,"1. Before reading the <i>Shema,</i> the reader washes his hands in water. If the time for reading has arrived, and he does not find water for the preliminary washing, he is not to delay the reading in order to search for water; but he is to wipe his hands with earth, or on anything solid, on a beam or similar object, and then he reads."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.2,"2. The <i>Shema</i> is not to be read in a bath house nor in a latrine, even if there is no ordure in it, nor in a graveyard, nor in proximity to a corpse. One is permitted to read it after moving away from the grave of a corpse to a distance of at least four cubits. If the <i>Shema</i> was read in a place where it was improper to do so, it must be read a second time."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.3,"3. Where a latrine has been newly erected but not yet used, the <i>Shema</i> may be read facing it, but not within it. In a new bath house, the <i>Shema</i> may be read. Where one of two buildings was set apart as a latrine, and the owner said of the second building, ""And this"", it is doubtful whether the latter has also been appropriated to the same use as the former, or not. Hence one may not deliberately read the <i>Shema</i> there, but whoever has done so has fulfilled his duty. If the owner uttered the phrase, ""This too"", both buildings are deemed to have been set apart as latrines, and the <i>Shema</i> may not be read in either. It is permitted to read the <i>Shema</i> in the courtyard of a bath house, i.e. in the place where people stand about, clothed."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.4,"4. Not only the sections of the <i>Shema,</i> but anything that appertains to things sacred may not be uttered in a bath house or latrine, even in a secular language. It is forbidden to speak there of such topics. Even to meditate silently on the words of the Torah in a latrine, in a bath house, or in any unclean place that contains ordure or urine, is also prohibited."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.5,"5. Secular matters may be discussed in a latrine, even in the Sacred (Hebrew) language. Thus also, the terms used to express the Divine Attributes, such as ""Merciful"", ""Gracious"", ""Faithful"", etc., may be uttered in a latrine. But the Proper Names of the Deity—which may not be erased—must not be uttered in a latrine or in a bath house that had been used. If, however, there is occasion in a bath house or latrine, to restrain one from what is forbidden, this should be done, even if the Sacred Tongue has to be used and the matter appertains to things sacred."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.6,"6. It is forbidden to read the <i>Shema</i> where one is facing ordures of human beings, dogs or swine, even if hides are immersed in them (for tanning), or any other filth that emits an odor as foul as these. This reading is also forbidden where one is facing human urine. But where there is urine of a beast, the <i>Shema</i> may be read in front of it. When an infant is so young that it could not consume a quantity of cereal equal in volume to an olive, in the time that it would take an adult to eat a quantity of cereal equal in volume to three eggs, there is no need to move away from its stools or urine (in order to read the <i>Shema</i>)."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.7,"7. If the ordure is as dry as earthenware, the <i>Shema</i> may not be read before it. If it is drier than earthenware, so that it crumbles when flung away, it is regarded as dust, and the <i>Shema</i> may be read before it. When urine, which the ground soaked up, still wets the hand touching the spot, the <i>Shema</i> may not be read before it. Where this condition no longer obtains, the <i>Shema</i> may be read there."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.8,"8. How far must one remove from ordure or urine, to be permitted to read the <i>Shema?</i> Four cubits. This applies to the case where these are behind him or beside him. But if they are in front of him, he must move away so far that he no longer sees them, and then he reads the <i>Shema.</i>"
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.9,"9. This rule applies when he is in a room and on the same level with these. But if there was a place ten hand-breadths higher or lower than the level of their situation, he can stay there and read the <i>Shema,</i> there being an intervening space between him and the excreta—provided however that no foul odor reaches him. So too, if he covered the ordure or urine with a vessel, they are regarded, though still in the room, as buried, and the <i>Shema</i> may be read notwithstanding their being there."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.10,"10. If one is separated from ordure by a glass partition even if the ordure is still visible through the glass, the <i>Shema</i> may be read near it. When a quarter of a log of water (= the volume of a hen's egg and a half) has been poured into a vessel containing urine of one micturition, the <i>Shema</i> may be recited within four cubits of it."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.11,"11. If ordure is in a hollow in the ground, one may stand with his sandal covering the hollow and read the <i>Shema,</i> provided that the sandal is not in contact with the ordure. If it is exceedingly minute, a mere drop, he expectorates thick saliva upon it till it is covered and reads the <i>Shema</i>…. Many Geonim have decided that it is forbidden to read the <i>Shema</i> if the hands are unclean and it is right to follow this ruling."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.12,"12. Where a foul odor emanates from any substance, one must move away [from it] to a distance of four cubits, and then one may read the <i>Shema,</i> if the odor has ceased. If it is still perceptible, one must move to a further distance where it is no longer perceptible…. The <i>Shema</i> may not be read in front of a cesspool or before a chamberpot, even though these are empty and emit no odor, they being regarded as a latrine."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.13,"13. When filth is moving, e.g. if it is floating on the water's surface, it is forbidden to read the <i>Shema,</i> opposite it. A swine's mouth is regarded as moving filth; it is forbidden to read the <i>Shema</i> opposite it, till the swine has passed on beyond the reader's presence to a distance of four cubits."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.14,"14. If one, while walking, is reading the <i>Shema</i> and reaches a place where there is filth, he should not place his hand over his mouth and continue to read, but he must pause till he has passed the place."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.15,"15. If, when about to read the <i>Shema</i> in a room, a doubt arises in one's mind as to whether or not there is ordure or urine in it, he may read. If he is standing on a dust heap and he is in doubt as to whether there is ordure there, he is not to read till he has made an investigation, the presumption in the case of a dust heap being that it is a place where there is filth. If the doubt is as to whether there is urine there, he may read."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.16,"16. Just as the <i>Shema</i> may not be read in a place where there is ordure or urine till he has moved away [to a distance of at least four cubits], so it is forbidden to read the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of any person, even a gentile or child, whose privy parts are exposed, even though a glass partition separates him from them, unless he turns away his face. Since he is able to see, he may not read the <i>Shema,</i> unless he turns away his face. Any part of a woman's body falls under the same rule. Hence, while reading the <i>Shema,</i> one must not gaze at a woman's body, even if she is his wife. And if a hand-breadth of a part of her body [which is usually covered] is exposed, he must not read the <i>Shema</i> while facing it."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.17,"17. And just as one is forbidden to read the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of any one, the lower part of whose body is exposed, so it is forbidden for anyone to read it, who is himself in the same condition. One must accordingly not read it when nude, till he covers his nakedness. If his loins are covered with a girdle of cloth, skin or sacking, he may read the <i>Shema,</i> even though the rest of the body is uncovered, provided that (when sitting cross-legged) his heel does not touch his privy parts. If he is lying under a coverlid, and is otherwise without clothing, he should draw the coverlid closely below his heart, and then read the <i>Shema.</i> But he should not draw it about his neck and read it, for in that case there would be nothing separating his heart from the lower part of his body, and he would be in the same class with one who recites the <i>Shema</i> without wearing a girdle."
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.18,"18. When two persons are lying under one coverlid, neither of them may read the <i>Shema,</i> even if he draws the coverlid closely beneath his heart, unless the coverlid is so arranged as to separate them, so that their bodies, from the loins downward, do not touch. When a man is sleeping with his wife, young children or other young members of his household, their bodies are like his, and he is not affected by contact with them. Hence, even if his body touches theirs, he turns away his face, draws the cover closely beneath his heart and then reads the <i>Shema.</i>"
Laws of Reading the Shema.3.19,"19. Up to what age are they, in this respect, regarded as young children? A boy, in this respect, till the age of twelve years and a day; a girl, till she is eleven years and a day old. And then only if they have the marks of puberty—breasts developed and hair on the body. In that case, he may not read the <i>Shema</i> unless they are separated by clothing. But if they are not physically so developed, he may read the <i>Shema,</i> even though their flesh touches his, and there is no need of separation till the male child has attained the age of thirteen years and a day, and the female child is twelve years and a day old."
Laws of Reading the Shema.4.1,"1. Women, slaves and children are exempt from the duty of reading the <i>Shema.</i> Children are taught to read it at the proper time; and they recite at the same time the blessings preceding and following it, so that they may be trained in the performance of religious duties. One whose mind is preoccupied and in an agitated state because of any religious duty which he has to perform is freed from the obligation of reading the <i>Shema.</i> Hence, a bridegroom who has wedded a virgin is exempted from reading the <i>Shema</i> till he has consummated the marriage…. If however consummation has been deferred till the night after the Sabbath subsequent to the marriage, it is his duty to read the <i>Shema</i> from that night and onwards, as his mind has become calm and he is already familiar with his bride."
Laws of Reading the Shema.4.2,"2. But if one marries a woman who was not at the time a virgin, it is his duty to read the <i>Shema,</i> there being no specific circumstance that would distract his mind. The same principle applies to similar cases."
Laws of Reading the Shema.4.3,"3. He who has been bereaved of a relative for whom he has to keep the period of mourning is exempted from reading the <i>Shema</i> till he has buried the body, as his mind is not free for reading it. A watcher, even if the body is not that of a relative, is exempt from reading the <i>Shema.</i> When there are two watchers, one watches while the other withdraws to another room and reads it. Then he returns and watches while his companion withdraws and reads it. So too, one who is engaged in digging a grave for the interment of a human body is exempt, for the time being, from reading the <i>Shema.</i>"
Laws of Reading the Shema.4.4,"4. The body is not to be removed for burial, close to the time when the <i>Shema</i> has to be read, unless the deceased was a great man. If the funeral procession had started, and the time for reading the <i>Shema</i> arrived while the bier is being followed, those needed for [carrying] it, such as the bearers and those who relieve them as well as those by whom these in turn are relieved, are exempt from reading the <i>Shema,</i> whether they are in front of the bier or behind it. Others who follow the bier but are not needed to carry it are obliged to read the <i>Shema.</i>"
Laws of Reading the Shema.4.5,"5. When the people are engaged in listening to funeral addresses and the time arrives to read the <i>Shema,</i> they withdraw singly, to read the <i>Shema,</i> and return to listen to the funeral addresses that are delivered in the presence of the dead. But if the dead body is not in the place where they are gathered, all those present read the <i>Shema</i>—the mourner however is silent as he is under no obligation to read the <i>Shema</i> till he has buried his dead."
Laws of Reading the Shema.4.6,"6. After the interment, when the mourners have returned from the grave to receive condolences, and the people follow them from the grave to the spot where the mourners stand, to form a line to receive condolences—if there is time for the people to commence and conclude the recital of at least one verse of the <i>Shema</i> before they reach the line, they should do so. Otherwise they are not to begin but should first offer their condolences to the mourners, and, after they have left them, read the <i>Shema.</i> Those who are in the interior lines and face the mourners are exempt from the duty of reading the <i>Shema;</i> but those who stand in the exterior lines, since they do not see the mourners, have the duty of reading the <i>Shema</i> where they are standing."
Laws of Reading the Shema.4.7,"7. If one, exempt from reading the <i>Shema,</i> nevertheless desires to fulfill his duty strictly, and read it, he may do so, provided that his mind is free. But if such an exempted individual is in an excited state, he may not read it, till his mind is composed."
Laws of Reading the Shema.4.8,"8. All who are ritually unclean are bound nevertheless to read the <i>Shema</i>; and, while still unclean, they recite the blessings that precede and succeed it, even if it is possible for them to get rid of their uncleanness, on the same day; as is the case with those who have touched a creeping thing, or touched a woman in the period of menstruation, or touched one who has a running issue, or the couch on which anyone of these has lain, etc. Ezra and his colleagues ordained that only one who had had an emission—as an exception to all unclean classes—may not read the words of the Torah till he has ritually bathed. This ordinance was not adopted universally. The majority of the community were unable to observe it, and it fell into desuetude. All Israelites have accordingly had the custom to read the Torah and recite the <i>Shema,</i> notwithstanding that they had had emissions. For the words of the Torah are insusceptible of defilement, but remain always pure, as it is said, ""Is it not thus, my words are like fire, saith the Lord"" (Jeremiah 23:29). Even as fire is incapable of being defiled, so the words of the Torah are insusceptible of defilement, but keep their purity forever."
Laws of Reading the Shema.4.9,"Blessed be the All-merciful, Who hath aided us."
