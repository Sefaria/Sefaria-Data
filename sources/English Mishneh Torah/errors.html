The four Pentateuchal sections, beginning respectively, \\\\&quot;Sanctify unto me\\\\&quot; (Ex. 13:1-10), \\\\&quot;And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee\\\\&quot; (Exodus 13:11-16)\\\\u2014these two being in the Book of Exodus, \\\\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) \\\\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13-21), are written and covered with a skin. These are called &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; and are placed upon the head and bound on the arm. The omission of the point of a single letter in any one of these sections bars, according to Scriptural enactment, the use of all of them. They must all be written perfectly and in accordance with rule.&quot;, &quot;2. This is the case also with the two sections of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; beginning respectively, \\\\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) and \\\\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). If the point of a letter is missing in these two sections, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may not, according to Scriptural enactment, be used. The two sections must be written perfectly. So too, a scroll of the Law, in which a single letter is missing, is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;3. There are ten points in regard to &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; (phylacteries). The observance of each is enjoined by a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. The neglect of any of them is an absolute bar to the use of the &lt;i&gt;Tephillin.&lt;/i&gt; Hence, if there was a variation in any one of them, the &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; are unfit for use. Two of these have reference to the writing; eight, to the covering and the tying of the straps. The two points to be observed in the writing are that the sections must be written with ink, and must be written on parchment.&quot;, &quot;4. How is the ink prepared? Soot of oils or of pitch, wax or similar substance is collected; kneaded with gum of trees and a little honey; thoroughly wetted and pounded till it is like wafers. It is then stored away. When the scribe wishes to write, he soaks it in water in which gall-apples or similar substances have been steeped, and with this fluid he writes. Such writing when erased leaves no mark. This is the best way to write scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs.&lt;/i&gt; If the scribe has written with fluid of the gall-oak or of caper,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*Caper: flower-buds or seeds of a low shrub of Mediterranean countries, used as a condiment.&lt;/i&gt; since the writing stays and is not rubbed out, scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; so written are fit for use.&quot;, &quot;5. This being so, what is excluded by the Halacha, dating back to Moses, which ordains that these must be written with ink? It excludes pigments of other colors, such as red or green, etc.; so that if even a single letter in a scroll of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; was written with pigment of any other color [but black] or with gold, such a Scroll, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;6. There are three kinds of parchment, &lt;i&gt;Gewil, Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Duxustus.&lt;/i&gt; How are these made? A hide of domestic cattle or wild beast is taken. First, its hair is removed. It is then pickled in salt, afterwards prepared with flour and subsequently tanned with gall-wood or similar materials which contract the pores of the hide and make it durable. And this it is that is called &lt;i&gt;Gewil&lt;/i&gt; (parchment of whole-hide leather).&quot;, &quot;7. If, after removing the hair, the hide had been split through its thickness into two parts, so as to make of it two skins, one thin, namely that which had been next to the hair; the other thick, namely that which had been next to the flesh, and if these were prepared first with salt, then with flour and afterwards with gall-wood or similar substance the skin which had been next to the hair is called &lt;i&gt;Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; (= outer-skin parchment), and that which had been next to the flesh is called &lt;i&gt;Duxustus&lt;/i&gt; (inner-skin parchment).&quot;, &quot;8. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that the scroll of the Law should be written on &lt;i&gt;Gewil&lt;/i&gt; (whole hide parchment), and the writing should be on the side which had been next to the hair. The &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; should be written on &lt;i&gt;Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; (the exterior part of the split hide) and the writing should be on the side which had been nearer the flesh; and the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; should be written on &lt;i&gt;Duxustus&lt;/i&gt; (made of the inner part of the split hide), on the side which had been nearer the hair. If, on a &lt;i&gt;Kelaf,&lt;/i&gt; one writes on the side that had been next to the hair, or, on a &lt;i&gt;Gewil or Duxustus,&lt;/i&gt; one writes on the side that had been next to the flesh, the Scroll, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; so written is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;9. Though this is the rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai, yet if one writes a scroll of the Law on parchment made from the exterior half of a split hide it is fit for use. The reason why a complete hide is mentioned is in order to exclude that made from the inner half of the split hide. If one wrote on it a scroll of the Law, it is unfit for use. So also, if one wrote a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on the external half of a split hide or on an undivided hide, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use. The inner half of a split hide is recommended to be used, only as a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (specially approved).&quot;, &quot;10. Scrolls, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; are not written on the hide of a domestic or wild beast that is unclean or on the skin of an unclean bird. They are written on the hides of domestic or wild beasts that are clean or on the skins of clean birds, even when the flesh of these animals may not be eaten owing to their not having been slaughtered according to the ritual or being found to have suffered from a lesion of a mortal character. Nor are Scrolls, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; written on the skin of a fish, even if it be of a clean species, because of its foulness. For this is not removed by tanning.&quot;, &quot;11. The undivided skin for a scroll of the Law, and the external half of the hide to be used for &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or for a scroll of the Law must be tanned for their specific purposes. If they were not expressly so tanned, they are not fit for use. Accordingly, if a non-Israelite or a Samaritan tanned them, they are unfit for use. Even if the Samaritan was instructed to tan a particular hide for the purpose of its being used for a scroll of the Law or &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; it is unfit for use; since he works with his own purposes in mind, not with those of his employer. Hence, anything that has to be done with a purpose in mind, if done by a Samaritan, is unfit for use. The skin for a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; does not require to be tanned for that express purpose.&quot;, &quot;12. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that a scroll of the Law or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may only be written on parchment that is ruled. Phylacteries need not be ruled, because they are covered. So too, phylacteries and a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may be written from memory, as these sections are recited by and are familiar to everyone. But not a single letter may be written in a scroll of the Law, except from a written copy of the text.&quot;, &quot;13. A scroll of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; written by a heretic must be burnt. If written by a Samaritan, by a Jew converted to another faith, by one who surrenders Israelites to tyrants, by a slave, woman or minor, they are unfit for use, and must be hidden; for it is said, \\\\&quot;And thou shalt bind them\\\\&quot;, \\\\&quot;And thou shalt write them\\\\&quot;. The implication is that only that person is qualified to write them, who is charged with the duty of putting on &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and believes in the obligation. If they are found in the possession of a heretic, and it is not known who wrote them, they should be hidden. If found in the possession of a Samaritan or non-Israelite, they are fit to be used. Scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; are not to be bought from non-Israelites for more than their value, so as not to accustom the latter to steal these holy articles or take them by force.&quot;, &quot;14. A scroll of the Law, phylacteries or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth,&lt;/i&gt; written on the skin of a beast or bird\\\\u2014whether domestic or wild\\\\u2014which belongs to an unclean species, or written on skins that have not been tanned, and likewise a scroll of the Law or phylacteries written on skins not expressly tanned for those purposes, are unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;15. If one who writes a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; had not concentrated his mind while writing, and wrote one of the Names of God without express intent, these articles are unfit for use. Accordingly, when one is writing the name of God, even if an Israelite king greets him, he must not return the greeting. If he is writing two or three names of God, he may pause between writing one and writing the others and may respond.&quot;, &quot;16. After dipping the pen in ink to write the Name of God, the scribe does not start with a letter of the name but with a letter of the previous word. If he altogether forgot to write the name of God, he writes it above the line. But to write part of the name on the line and part above the line makes the scroll unfit for use. Other words that the scribe forgot to write may be written partly on the line and partly above it. These rules apply to a scroll of the Law. But in a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; or in phylacteries not a letter may be written above the line. If the scribe forgot even one letter, he must hide what he wrote and write a fresh slip. In all of them (Scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; and Phylacteries) it is permissible to write the name of God upon a surface from which writing has been erased or obliterated.&quot;, &quot;17. Scribes of scrolls, phylacteries and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; are forbidden to turn over the parchment sheet with its written surface beneath touching the board on which it lies, but should cover it with a cloth or fold it.&quot;, &quot;18. If, after a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; had passed out of the scribe\\\&#39;s hands, he makes the statement, \\\\&quot;I did not write the name of God in them with that purpose distinctly in mind\\\\&quot;, he is not believed to the extent of rendering them unfit for use, but his statement is accepted so far that he forfeits his entire remuneration. The reason why he is not believed so as to render them unfit for use is because his motive may possibly have been to cause a loss to the person who bought or hired them. It would seem however that his statement would only cause him to forfeit that quota of remuneration to which the writing of the names of God would entitle him. Hence, if he stated, \\\\&quot;the skins of this scroll of the Law or of these phylacteries were not expressly tanned for those purposes\\\\&quot;, then since in such a case he is believed so fully that he forfeits the whole of his remuneration, his statement is also credited so as to disqualify the articles from being used\\\\u2014it being a matter of general knowledge that if the skins had not been expressly tanned for the purpose of being made into phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, the scribe receives no remuneration whatsoever.&quot;, &quot;19. Phylacteries and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; may only be written in square Hebrew script. Permission was also given to write scrolls of the Law in Greek characters but not in those of any other foreign tongue. The ancient Greek script has gone out of use, been corrupted and become obsolete. Hence, at the present day, all three religious articles,\\\\u2014Scroll of the Law, Tephillin and Mezuzah,\\\\u2014are only written in the square Hebrew script. Care must be taken in writing that no letter shall adhere to any other letter; for any letter which is not completely surrounded on all four sides by a blank space of parchment has been improperly written. Any letter that cannot be read by a child of ordinary intelligence\\\\u2014not particularly bright or dull\\\\u2014is improperly written. Thus a &lt;i&gt;Yod&lt;/i&gt; must not be like a &lt;i&gt;Vav&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Vav&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Yod,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Koph&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Beth,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Beth&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Koph,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Daleth&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Resh,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Resh&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Daleth,&lt;/i&gt; etc., so that the reader may be able to read fluently.&quot;, &quot;20. If the parchment was perforated, the scribe must not write on the perforation. A perforation over which the ink passes is not regarded as a perforation, and it is permitted to write across it. Hence, it is permitted to write on the skin of a bird that has been tanned. Should the parchment have become perforated, after it has been written on, if the perforation is in the interior of a letter, as, for example, in a &lt;i&gt;H\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mem,&lt;/i&gt; etc., it is regarded as properly written. Should one of the sides of a letter have been perforated, so that the letter is divided\\\\u2014then the rule is that if there is left of the part that is unperforated as much as would form a small letter, it is regarded as properly written, provided that it does not resemble a different letter. If the part that is left unperforated is not as much as would form a small letter, it is not regarded as properly written.&quot;], [&quot;1. How are the sections in the phylactery that is placed on the head to be written? The four sections are respectively written on four separate slips of parchment; each slip is rolled up separately and they are then placed in four compartments composed of one skin. As to the phylactery placed on the arm, these four sections are written in four columns on one slip of parchment. This slip is rolled up like a scroll of the Law from the last column to the first and is placed in one [leather] compartment.&quot;, &quot;2. The scribe must exercise care in writing these sections, for if he wrote a closed section as an open one,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*that is, began the section on a new line where only a space of nine letters should have been left blank.&lt;/i&gt; or wrote an open section as if it were closed, the slip is unfit for use. The first three sections are, all of them, open. The last section, that beginning, \\\\&quot;And it shall come to pass, if ye will hearken diligently\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is closed.&quot;, &quot;3. He must exercise care in regard to the words that are &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;**with or without a &lt;i&gt;Yod&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Vav,&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&lt;/i&gt; that all the four sections should be written as they are in an examined scroll of the Law. For if he wrote a word &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; that should have been written &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; the slip is unfit for use till the superfluous letter has been obliterated. If a word that is &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; has been written &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; the slip is unfit for use and cannot be made good. The following is the list of the words in these four sections that are &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&quot;, &quot;[&lt;i&gt;For paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 (lists of&lt;/i&gt; plene &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; defective &lt;i&gt;words), see the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 121b and 122a&lt;/i&gt;.]&quot;, &quot;6. The &lt;i&gt;Ayin&lt;/i&gt; of Shema and &lt;i&gt;Daleth&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Echad&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 6:4) are to be written in larger type.&quot;, &quot;8. He must pay attention to the \\\\&quot;crowns\\\\&quot; (tittles) above the letters. These are like an upright &lt;i&gt;Zayin&lt;/i&gt; and are placed on each letter to which such a crown belongs as written in the scroll of the Law. The following are the letters in the four sections thus ornamented:&quot;, &quot;9. In the first section, there is only one such letter, namely the closed &lt;i&gt;Mem&lt;/i&gt; in Meeyamim which has over it three &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. In the second section, there are five letters, each of them a &lt;i&gt;H\\\\u00e9;&lt;/i&gt; and on each, there are four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. These are the &lt;i&gt;H\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Unesanah; the first and the last &lt;i&gt;H\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Hikshah; the &lt;i&gt;H\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Vayaharog; the &lt;i&gt;H\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Yadchah.&quot;, &quot;10. The third section has five such letters. The &lt;i&gt;Koof&lt;/i&gt; in Uvekoomecha has over it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines; the &lt;i&gt;Koof&lt;/i&gt; in Ukeshartam has over it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines; the two letters &lt;i&gt;Teth,&lt;/i&gt; and the letter &lt;i&gt;P\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Letotaphoth have on each of them four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines.&quot;, &quot;11. The fourth section has five such letters. The &lt;i&gt;P\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; of Veasaphta has above it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. The &lt;i&gt;Tav&lt;/i&gt; of Veasaphta has one &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped line. The two letters &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; and the letter &lt;i&gt;P\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Letotaphoth have on each of them four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. Altogether, the letters thus ornamented are sixteen. If the scribe wholly omitted these ornaments, added to them or omitted them over some of the letters, he has not rendered the phylacteries unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;12. If one buys phylacteries from one who is not a recognized expert, he has to examine them. If he bought from him one hundred parchment slips, he examines three slips, either two of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the arm or two slips of those in the phylacteries worn on the arm and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head. If he found all these three correct, a presumption is established in the vendor\\\&#39;s favour, and all his phylacteries are fit for use and the rest need not be examined. If he bought them however in several bundles, this examination (of three slips) must take place in each bundle, there being a presumption that the several bundles came from different individuals.&quot;, &quot;13. A man who wrote phylacteries with his own hand or purchased them from an expert or, having bought them of a non-expert, examined them and replaced them in their leather containers, need never re-examine them, even after the lapse of many years. As long as the leather container remains sound, the presumption that they are sound holds good. Nor is it apprehended that a letter has been obliterated or perforated. Hillel the Elder was wont to say, \\\\&quot;These phylacteries belonged to my mother\\\&#39;s father.\\\\&quot;&quot;], [&quot;1. There are eight rules for the making of phylacteries; all of them are traditionally ascribed to Moses who received them on Sinai; hence the observance of all of them is indispensable. A variation from any of them renders the phylacteries unfit for use. The rules are as follows: The phylacteries (that is, the external leather containers) must be square; they are to be sewn in such a way as to retain the square shape; their diagonals must be those of a square so that all the angles shall be equal; the leather container of the phylactery for the head shall have the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; embossed on the right and on the left side; each of the slips of parchment on which the sections from the Pentateuch are written is to be wrapt in a cover; this is to be tied with hair, and then the slips are placed in their respective compartments which are sewn up with sinews; a border with a fold open at both ends shall be made of the skin of the base for the strap to pass through freely; the straps shall be black, and have the special knot, that is known to all, in the shape of a &lt;i&gt;Daleth.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;2. How is the phylactery for the head made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length, breadth and height. It is of no consequence however if the height is more than the breadth or less. What is essential is that the length and breadth shall be equal. Three grooves are cut in the block so that it is divided into four parts as in this figure &lt;img src=\\\\&quot;data:image/jpg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEBLAEsAAD/2wBDAAUDBAQEAwUEBAQFBQUGBwwIBwcHBw8LCwkMEQ8SEhEP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\\\\nClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUH//Z\\\\n\\\\&quot;&gt;. A piece of leather is taken and soaked in water. The wooden block is put in it and the leather is inserted into each groove. While it is still damp, it is crinkled on both sides, to make a shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; with three lines on the right side of the wearer and with four lines on the left side.&quot;, &quot;3. The leather is left on the wood till it dries; it is then slipped off from the wooden block, with the result that it has the shape of four compartments. The prescribed sections of Scripture written on slips of parchment are placed, one in each compartment. A portion of the leather is drawn round and beneath the cube (to form its base). This is sewn up at its four sides. A portion is left in this skin at the base for the strap to pass through as in a loop. This it is which is called the bridge.&quot;, &quot;4. How are the phylacteries for the arm made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length and breadth. It is to be a finger-breadth in height, or a little more or less. The block is covered with wet leather which is left on till it dries. It is then removed, and in the place where the wood had been, a single slip of parchment on which the four prescribed sections of Scripture are written, is inserted. A portion of the leather is drawn round below and is sewn up at its four sides. Of this base a part is left to form a loop for the strap to pass through.&quot;, &quot;5. What is the order in which the sections are placed in the phylactery for the head? The last section, that beginning, \\\\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye will hearken diligently\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is placed in the first compartment, to the right of the wearer; the section beginning, \\\\&quot;Hear O Israel\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4) in the compartment adjacent to it; the section beginning, \\\\&quot;And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God will bring thee\\\\&quot; (Exodus 13:11), next to the one containing the section, \\\\&quot;Hear O Israel\\\\&quot;, and the section beginning, \\\\&quot;Sanctify unto me every first born\\\\&quot; (Exodus 13:1) in the fourth compartment which would be to the left of the wearer of the phylactery; so that anyone facing the wearer and reading what is before him would read the sections in the right Scriptural order as in the annexed figure. If there&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*Sections beginning with verse:&lt;/i&gt; was a deviation from this order, the phylacteries are not fit for use.&quot;, &quot;6. The sections for the phylactery for the arm are written in four columns on one long strip of parchment like a scroll of the Law, and in the order in which they are found in the Pentateuch as in the annexed figure.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;**Sections beginning with verse:&lt;/i&gt; If the scribe wrote them on four separate slips and placed them in one compartment, he has done what is required, and need not attach them to each other.&quot;, &quot;7. When he rolls up the parchment slips containing the sections, for the phylacteries worn on the head or on the arm, he rolls them from the end to the beginning so that, if opened, each section can be read from the beginning to the end.&quot;, &quot;8. When the slips are about to be placed in their respective compartments, they are wrapped in a cloth, over which they are fastened with hair. They are then deposited in their compartments. This hair must be that of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species; and may even be taken from animals which are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;***&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;***&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\\\u2014died of itself or, by extension of meaning, not properly killed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;\\\\u2020&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;\\\\u2020&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;\\\\u2014torn by wild beast; by extension of meaning, found to have suffered from mortal disease or lesion.&lt;/i&gt; The custom that has come into general use is to fasten the slips with hair taken from calves\\\&#39; tails.&quot;, &quot;9. The leather receptacles of the phylacteries are only sewn with sinews of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species, and may be taken from animals of such species even if they are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\\\u2014died of itself or, by extension of meaning, not properly killed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;\\\\u2014torn by wild beast; by extension of meaning, found to have suffered from mortal disease or lesion.&lt;/i&gt; The sinews used are those found in the heel of the domestic or wild beast, which are white and tough. They are softened by pounding them with stones or similar substances, till they become like flax. They are spun and twined, and then used for sewing the phylacteries and the sheets of the scrolls of the Law.&quot;, &quot;10. The receptacles are to be sewn in such a way as to preserve the square contour of the base. It is a broadly established rule that on each side, there are to be three stitches, making altogether twelve stitches, whether the phylactery is for the arm or for the head. If the scribe desires to make ten or fourteen stitches, he may do so. The stitch must pass through the leather on both sides.&quot;, &quot;11. The grooves of the phylacteries for the head ought to extend to the base where the stitching is done. If the grooves are recognizable so that the four divisions clearly appear, the phylacteries are fit for use, even though the grooves do not extend to the base. If however the grooves are not recognizable, the phylacteries are unfit for use. Within each groove, above the leather, a thread or cord ought to be passed so as to separate the compartments from each other. The general custom is to draw through each of the three grooves a sinew of the same kind as those used for the stitches.&quot;, &quot;12. How are the thongs fixed? A strip of leather is taken as wide as the length of a barley corn. If wider, it is fit for use. The length of the strap of the phylactery for the head should be sufficient to encircle the head, form the knot and leave enough for the straps on either side to reach to the navel or a little higher. The strap for the phylactery of the arm should be sufficiently long to encircle the forearm, form the knot, extend down to the middle finger, about which it is to be wound three times and then fastened. If the straps exceed in length the foregoing dimensions, they are also fit for use.&quot;, &quot;13. The thong of the phylactery for the head is inserted in the loop open at both ends. It is measured to fit the wearer\\\&#39;s head, and then tied in a rectangular knot like a &lt;i&gt;Daleth.&lt;/i&gt; This knot, every scholar should learn how to make. It is impossible to teach its form by description; this can only be taught by ocular demonstration. In the case of the phylactery for the arm, the thong is tied in a knot in the shape of a &lt;i&gt;Yod.&lt;/i&gt; The thong of the phylactery for the arm should move freely in the loop, so that the wearer can loosen or tighten it when he puts it on his arm.&quot;, &quot;14. The thongs of the phylacteries, whether for the head or for the arm, must have their exterior surface black. This is a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. But the other side of the thongs, being close to the skin, are fit for use if they are green or white. They must not however be red, for if the thong were inadvertently turned, the color of its lower surface would subject the wearer to ignominy. The lower side of the thongs should not be otherwise in color than the base of the leather case containing the parchment slips. If the latter is green, the former should be green; if white, the former should be white. It is comely if the phylacteries are wholly black, namely, both the case containing the slips of parchment and the thongs.&quot;, &quot;15. The leather which forms the receptacles of the phylacteries and its thongs is to be made from the hide of a domestic or wild quadruped or skin of a fowl that belongs to the clean species, and may even be taken from those of these species that are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Terefah.&lt;/i&gt; If they were made of the skin or hide of unclean species, or if the phylacteries were covered with gold, the phylacteries are unfit for use. The leather for the thongs must be expressly tanned for their intended purpose to be thongs of phylacteries. The leather which forms the receptacles for the phylacteries need not be tanned. Even if it consists of raw hide it is fit for use. Many places have the custom to make them of raw hide.&quot;, &quot;16. The receptacles of the phylacteries may not be prepared by any one but an Israelite; for the making of these is like the writing of the prescribed sections because of the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; which is embossed on the phylactery for the head, as we have already stated. Hence, if a non-Israelite made or sewed the phylacteries, they are unfit for use. So too, whoever is disqualified from writing the prescribed sections for the phylacteries may not prepare them.&quot;, &quot;17. The phylactery for the head may not be transformed into a phylactery for the arm, but the latter may be changed into the former; on the principle that an object may not be degraded from a higher to a lower sacred use. So too, the thong of the phylactery for the head may not be transferred to a phylactery for the arm. This rule only applies to phylacteries that had been worn. But with regard to phylacteries for the head that no one had ever worn, if it is desired to transform them into phylacteries for the arm, this may be done. How is this effected? It is covered with leather so that it appears as one receptacle. The phylactery may then be bound on the arm.&quot;, &quot;18. In case the stitches of the phylacteries are broken, they become unfit for use if there are two broken stitches adjacent to each other, or three not adjacent. This rule applies to old phylacteries. New phylacteries are fit for use as long as they keep their surface unimpaired. The following would be called new. If, at the place where the stitches have given way, part of the leather is held in the hand so that the phylactery is suspended, and the leather is strong enough not to be further torn, such phylacteries would be regarded as new. If however the leather is not strong enough to bear the weight of the phylacteries so suspended, but would tear, such phylacteries are regarded as old.&quot;, &quot;19. A thong that has become broken is not to be tied together nor sewn up; but it is to be removed, put away, and replaced by a new thong. The parts of the broken thong are unfit for use unless the length and breadth of the part is of the prescribed dimension or larger. Care should always be taken that the external surface of the thongs should be above, when the phylacteries are bound on the hand or round the head. End of the chapter.&quot;], [&quot;1. Where is the phylactery of the head placed? It is placed on that part of the crown of the head, where the hair adjacent to the forehead ends, and this is the place where an infant\\\&#39;s brain pulsates (the fontanelle). The phylactery needs to be adjusted so that it lies in the centre of the forehead, in a line with the point between the eyes. The knot should be at the top of the back of the neck, which is the end of the skull.&quot;, &quot;2. The phylactery of the hand is bound on the left arm over the biceps muscle which is the flesh that stands out on the upper arm that is intermediate between the shoulder-blade and forearm, so that when the upper arm is held close to the ribs, the phylactery will be opposite the heart and thus the precept will be fulfilled, \\\\&quot;And these words \\\\u2026 shall be upon thine heart\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:6).&quot;, &quot;3. To lay the phylactery of the hand on the palm or that of the head on the forehead is the practice of the Sadducees. He who makes the phylactery round like a nut is not fulfilling the precept in any way. A left-handed person lays the phylactery on his right arm, used by him as his left. If one is ambidextrous, he lays it on his left arm, which is the same as the left arm of any other person. The places where the phylacteries are respectively bound and laid are known by tradition.&quot;, &quot;4. The lack of a phylactery for the head does not preclude one from putting on that of the hand, nor does the lack of a phylactery of the hand preclude one from putting on that for the head. Each is a duty separate and independent. What blessings are recited? For the phylactery of the head, the formula is as follows: \\\\&quot;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and given us a command concerning the precept of phylacteries\\\\&quot;. For that of the hand, the form is as follows: \\\\&quot;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to lay the phylacteries\\\\&quot;.&quot;, &quot;5. This rule applies to the case where a person puts on one phylactery only. But when one lays both phylacteries, he recites one blessing, namely, the form, \\\\&quot;And hast commanded us to lay the phylacteries\\\\&quot;, binds the phylactery on his arm, and then puts on that for the head. When they are removed, that on the head is removed first, and afterwards that on the arm.&quot;, &quot;6. When a person has recited the blessing, \\\\&quot;Who hast commanded us to lay phylacteries\\\\&quot;, and bound the phylactery on his arm, he is forbidden to converse, even to the extent of acknowledging his master\\\&#39;s greeting, till he has put on the phylactery of the head. If he conversed he has committed a transgression; and when putting on the phylactery for the head, he must recite another blessing, viz: the form, \\\\&quot;Who hast given us a command concerning the precept of the phylacteries\\\\&quot;, and then he puts on the phylactery for the head.&quot;, &quot;7. On each occasion when one puts on phylacteries, the blessing is recited, even if they are removed and put on again several times in the day. It is a universal rule with regard to religious precepts that the appropriate blessings are recited prior to their performance. Hence too, the blessing for the phylactery of the hand has to be recited after it is placed on the biceps muscle before the thong is tightened, for the fastening constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.&quot;, &quot;8. When a person removes his phylacteries, and puts them in a bag, he should not place the phylactery of the hand beneath and that for the head above it, because when he will again have occasion to put them on, he will come into contact with the phylactery of the head first, will thus be under the necessity of putting it down and take out the phylactery of the hand, the former not being put on before the latter. It is forbidden to leave a precept and pass on to the fulfillment of another religious duty, the rule being that the duty that first presents itself should first engage our attention. Hence, the phylactery for the hand should be placed above so that one may come into contact with it first, and the phylacteries be put on in the right order.&quot;, &quot;9. A bag expressly intended to contain phylacteries and into which these have been placed, becomes consecrated and may not be put to secular use. If the bag was intended for this express purpose of containing phylacteries but had never contained them, or if phylacteries had been casually placed in a bag not set aside for that use, it does not become sacred, and continues to be a secular object as it had been hitherto. Phylacteries may not be suspended by their thong or by the part which contains the scriptural section. But the bag containing the phylacteries may be suspended.&quot;, &quot;10. The proper time for putting on phylacteries is when it is day and not when it is night, for it is said, \\\\&quot;Day by day\\\\&quot;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*Usually rendered, \\\\u201cfrom year to year\\\\u201d, referring to observance of the feast of Passover.&lt;/i&gt; (Exodus 13:10). \\\\&quot;The ordinance\\\\&quot; mentioned in this verse refers to the precept of phylacteries. So it is said, \\\\&quot;And it shall be for a sign\\\\&quot;, while Sabbaths and festivals are them-also, Sabbaths and festivals are not seasons for putting on phylacteries, for selves a sign. When is the proper time in the day to put on phylacteries? At the hour when a person can see his neighbour at a distance of four cubits and recognize him. The period extends till sunset.&quot;, &quot;11. A person who put on phylacteries before sunset, is permitted when it becomes dusk, to continue to wear them, even throughout the night. The multitude however is not to be so taught. Everyone should be instructed not to wear phylacteries at night, but to remove them at sunset. Whoever deliberately puts on phylacteries after sunset, violates a prohibition, for it is said, \\\\&quot;And thou shalt keep this ordinance in its season, day by day\\\\&quot; (Exodus 13:10).&quot;, &quot;12. If the sun sets while a man with the phylacteries on his head was on the road, he places his hand upon the phylactery till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If Sabbath or a festival arrived while he was sitting in the house of study, with the phylactery on his head, he places his hand upon it till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If there is a house near the City Wall,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*the house of study was outside the town.&lt;/i&gt; where the phylacteries could be safely left, he should leave them there. If he did not remove them after sunset, because he had no place where they would be safe, and he kept them on for the sake of security, his conduct is lawful.&quot;, &quot;13. One who is exempt from reading the &lt;i&gt;Shema&lt;/i&gt; is exempt from putting on phylacteries. If a child less than thirteen years of age knows how to take care of his phylacteries, his father purchases a set for him, so as to train him in the practice of religious precepts. Those who suffer intestinal troubles or have difficulty in controlling their sphincters are exempt from the obligation of putting on phylacteries. All who are ritually unclean are under the same obligation of putting on phylacteries as those who are ritually clean. One, who is in pain or whose mind is not calm and composed is exempt from the duty of putting on phylacteries; for the wearer must not allow his consciousness of them to wander. Priests while engaged in the temple service, Levites during the recital of hymns in their appointed places, Israelites while they are in the Sanctuary, are exempt from the duties of reciting the prayers and putting on phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;14. As long as one is wearing phylacteries, he should frequently touch them with his fingers, so as not to lose consciousness of them for a single moment. For their degree of sanctity is higher than that of the golden plate which the High Priest wore on his forehead. On the latter, the name of God was engraved once only, while the phylactery for the head contains the tetragrammaton twenty-one times, and the phylactery for the arm, an equal number of times.&quot;, &quot;15. A requisite in wearing phylacteries is physical cleanliness. One should take care that no flatus escapes him while he has them on. Hence, he may not, while wearing them, indulge in regular sleep or even doze. But if they are covered with a cloth, he may doze, even while wearing them. How so? He places his head between his knees and dozes in a sitting posture. If his phylacteries were folded and held in his hand, the holder may even sleep in the regular way.&quot;, &quot;16. No meal, unless it be of a casual character, may be eaten, while one wears phylacteries (without previous preparation). Before proceeding to a regular meal, he removes them, places them on the table, washes his hands, puts them on again, recites the blessing for food while he has them on.&quot;, &quot;17. If one feels a call of nature while wearing phylacteries, he is not to deposit them, before entering the lavatory, in the crevices that open towards the public thoroughfare, lest passers-by may take them. How should he act? Even if he needs to relieve the bladder while he is at a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, he should remove the phylacteries, roll them up in his garment, as a scroll is rolled up, grasp them in his right hand opposite his heart, taking care that not a thong projects outside his hand as much as a hand breadth; then he enters, relieves himself, and, after having left, goes away to a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, and puts on his phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;18. This rule only applies to the case of a permanent lavatory. But one may not enter an extemporized lavatory with phylacteries even rolled up. They should be removed and given to another person for safe keeping.&quot;, &quot;19. If one wearing phylacteries needed to go to the lavatory at eventide when there would be no more time to put them on again, he should not enter with the phylacteries rolled up in his garment, even to relieve his bladder, if the lavatory is a permanent one. How should he act? He should remove the phylacteries, place them in their bag which must be at least a hand breadth long, or even in a smaller bag provided it is not specially assigned as a receptable for phylacteries. This he keeps in his hand and enters. Thus, too, at night time, if he needs to visit the lavatory, he may put the phylacteries in a bag which he keeps in his hand when entering.&quot;, &quot;20. Translation omitted.&quot;, &quot;21. Translation omitted.&quot;, &quot;22. One is permitted to put on phylacteries in that portion of a bathhouse where all are attired. In that portion where some are in their attire while others are nude, the phylacteries which one wears need not be removed, but they may not be put on. Where all are nude, the phylacteries must be removed, and needless to add, they may not be put on.&quot;, &quot;23. A person should not walk in a cemetery with phylacteries on his head. When he is within a distance of four cubits from a corpse or a grave, the phylacteries are to be removed till he has passed on to a distance outside four cubits. Phylacteries must not be put on before one is decently covered and has put on his garments. If a person is carrying a burden on his head, he must remove the phylactery from his head, and may not put it on till he has removed the burden. Even a kerchief [alone] may not be put upon the head when one is wearing phylacteries. But he puts his cap over the phylactery.&quot;, &quot;24. In a room where there are phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, marital intercourse may not take place, till these have been taken out, or placed in a receptacle which itself is enclosed in another receptacle not assigned to the use of phylacteries or a scroll of the Law. If the latter receptacle has been so assigned, and even if there be ten such receptacles, they are all regarded as one receptacle. If he placed the sacred articles in two receptacles, one within the other, they may be put for security under his pillow between the bolster and the coverlid\\\\u2014not however exactly beneath his head. This may be done even if his wife shares his couch.&quot;, &quot;25. The sanctity of phylacteries is a high degree of sanctity. As long as phylacteries are on a man\\\&#39;s head and arm, he is humble and God-fearing, is not drawn into frivolity and idle talk, does not dwell on evil thoughts but occupies his mind with thoughts of truth and righteousness. A man should therefore endeavour to wear phylacteries the whole day, this being the right way of fulfilling the precept. It is said of &lt;i&gt;Rav,&lt;/i&gt; the disciple of our Sainted Teacher (R. Judah, the Prince), that throughout his life no one saw him, without Torah, Tzitzis (fringes on his garments) or phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;26. Although the proper mode of fulfilling the precept is to wear phylacteries the whole day, it is especially a duty to do so during the recital of prayers. The sages say, \\\\&quot;Whoever reads the &lt;i&gt;Shema&lt;/i&gt; without wearing phylacteries is regarded as testifying falsely in his own person.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*He recites the Commandment to wear &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and does not fulfill it.&lt;/i&gt; Whoever does not wear phylacteries at all violates eight affirmative precepts, since in each of the four sections, the command is set forth to lay phylacteries on the head and on the arm. Whoever wears phylacteries regularly will be blessed with longevity, as it is said, \\\&#39;The Lord is upon them: they shall live\\\&#39;\\\\&quot; (Isaiah 38:16).&quot;], [&quot;1. How is the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;**Sections of Scripture placed on doorposts.&lt;/i&gt; written? Two sections of the Pentateuch, those beginning, \\\\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4) and, \\\\&quot;And it shall come to pass\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) are written in a single column on one slip of parchment. A space of half a nail\\\&#39;s breadth is left as a margin above and below the column. If the Pentateuchal sections were written in two or three columns, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use. They must not however be written in the shape of a tail (broad at the top line and gradually narrowing to a point), or of a circle, or of a tent (narrow at the top and broadening to the base). A &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; written in any of these forms is unfit for use. If the text was written out of order, for example, if the second section was in front of the first, it is unfit for use. If it was written on two slips of parchment, even though these were sewn together, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use. A Scroll of the Law that has become worn out or phylacteries that are worn out may not be used for a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Nor may margins cut off from a scroll of the Law be so used; for anything dedicated to a sacred purpose may not be degraded from a higher to a lower degree of sacredness.&quot;, &quot;2. It is a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (an act of piety) to separate the section beginning, \\\\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\\\&quot; from that beginning, \\\\&quot;And it shall come to pass\\\\&quot; by a \\\\&quot;closed\\\\&quot; space (blank of nine letters). If the division between the two sections was an \\\\&quot;open\\\\&quot; one (the second section beginning a new line), the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use, as, in the Pentateuch, the second section does not immediately follow the first. Special heed should be paid to the tittles in the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; The following are the tittles which are made in the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;3. In the first section, there are seven letters, each of which should have above it three upright lines in the shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Zain.&lt;/i&gt; They are the &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ayin&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Shema; Nun&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nafshecha;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Totafoth.&lt;/i&gt; The second section has six letters, each of which should have above it three &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. They are the &lt;i&gt;Gimel&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Degancha;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Totafoth;&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;Tzadi&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Ha-aretz.&lt;/i&gt; If the tittles were omitted or if they are more or less than those specified, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; has not been rendered unfit for use. But if it was written without the lines having been ruled, or if the scribe paid no heed to &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; letters, or if he added in the text even a single letter, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;4. It is a universal custom to write the word &lt;i&gt;Shaddai&lt;/i&gt; (Almighty) on the other side of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; opposite the blank space between the two sections. As this word is written on the outside, the practice is unobjectionable. They, however, who write names of angels, holy names, a Biblical text or inscriptions usual on seals, within the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; are among those who have no portion in the world to come. For these fools not only fail to fulfill the commandment but they treat an important precept that expresses the Unity of God, the love of Him, and His worship, as if it were an amulet to promote their own personal interests; for, according to their foolish minds, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is something that will secure for them advantage in the vanities of the world.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*A reproof to those who sell Mezuzoth to be worn as amulets !&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;5. It is a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (act of piety) to write &lt;i&gt;Al Ha-aretz&lt;/i&gt; (the last two words) on the last line, either at the beginning or in the middle of the line. All the scribes follow the custom of writing the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; in twenty-two lines, and (the last two words) &lt;i&gt;Al Ha-aretz&lt;/i&gt; at the commencement of the last line. The following are the words in order, which begin each of the lines: (See the Hebrew text on the corresponding right-hand side, page 127b.)&quot;, &quot;6. When the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is folded, it is rolled up from the end of the line to the beginning, so that anyone opening it is able to read it from the beginning to the end of the line. After it has been rolled up, it is placed in a cylinder of reed, wood or other material, which is attached to the doorpost with a nail; or else a cavity is hollowed out in the doorpost, into which the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is inserted.&quot;, &quot;7. Before one affixes it to the doorpost, he recites the blessing, \\\\&quot;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us to affix the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah\\\\&quot;.&lt;/i&gt; No blessing is recited at the time when it is written, because the affixing of it constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.&quot;, &quot;8. If one suspended it on a staff, it is unfit, for this is not affixing it (to the doorpost). If one placed it behind the door, he has not fulfilled the precept. If he perforated the door and forced the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; into it like a nail, as a bolt is inserted in the staple-ring, it is unfit. If it was placed in a hollow of the doorpost at a depth of a hand-breadth, it is unfit. If one cut a stick, put a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on it, attached this stick to other sticks and made of them all a doorpost, it is unfit, because the affixing of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; preceded the erection of the doorpost.&quot;, &quot;9. The &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; of a private dwelling is examined once every seven years; that attached to a public building twice in the Jubilee (fifty years). The object is to ascertain whether a letter has been torn away or obliterated; because owing to the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; being affixed to walls, it is liable to decay.&quot;, &quot;10. The fulfillment of the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is incumbent upon all Israelites, including women and slaves (of Israelites). Children under the age of thirteen years are trained to affix the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; to their rooms. One who rents a dwelling outside the Holy Land, or lodges at an inn in the Holy Land is exempt from the obligation of affixing a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; for a period of thirty days after beginning his occupancy. But if one rents a home in the Holy Land, the duty of affixing a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; devolves immediately.&quot;, &quot;11. If one lets a dwelling to another person, the duty devolves upon the lessee to bring a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; and attach it, even if he has to pay for doing so, for the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is the personal obligation of the occupant and not an obligation attaching to the structure. When he surrenders possession, he must not, on quitting the premises, remove the Mezuzah. But if the owner is a non-Israelite, the Jewish tenant, when leaving, takes it away.&quot;], [&quot;1. There are ten conditions which must exist in a dwelling, to put the occupant under an obligation to affix a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If one of these is absent, he is exempt. These are as follows: The dwelling must have a superficial area of four cubits by four cubits or more; it must have two door-posts, a lintel, a roof and doors; the entrance should be ten hand-breadths high or more; it must be a secular (not a sacred) structure; it must have been erected for human occupancy, for honored use (not a lavatory), and built for permanent habitation.&quot;, &quot;2. A dwelling, the superficial area of which is less than four cubits by four cubits does not require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If its area is equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits, even if it is circular in shape or has five angles, or, needless to add, if its length is greater than its breadth, it requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; provided that it covers an area equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits.&quot;, &quot;3. A porch, that is a place with three walls and a roof, even though it has two uprights on the fourth side does not need a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; the uprights serving to support the roof and not as doorposts. Thus too, a roof without walls that rests on pillars on either side, even if it presents the appearance of a dwelling is exempt from the obligation of having a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; on account of its having no doorposts\\\\u2014the pillars having been erected to support the roof.&quot;, &quot;4. A dwelling with posts on either side (of the door), and in the place of the lintel an arch in the shape of a bow, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; provided that the posts are ten hand-breadths high or more. If they are not ten hand-breadths high, there is no such obligation, as the dwelling has no lintel.&quot;, &quot;5. A dwelling without a roof does not require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Where part of it is covered with a roof and part uncovered, it seems to me that if the portion over the entrance is roofed, the structure requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; After the doors are set up, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is affixed.&quot;, &quot;6. The Temple Mount, its chambers and courts, synagogues and houses of study which have no residences are exempt, because they are sacred. A village synagogue in which transients lodge requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; So too, a city synagogue which has a dwelling house attached to it, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; None of the Temple entrances had a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; except the Gate of Nikanor, and the gate within that gate, and the entrance to the Chamber of Parhedrin, because this chamber was the High Priest\\\&#39;s residence during his seven days of seclusion (prior to the Day of Atonement).&quot;, &quot;7. A hayloft, a cattle-shed, a wood store and a barn are exempted from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because of the phrase, \\\\&quot;thy house\\\\&quot; (in the text \\\\&quot;thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house\\\\&quot;), which means a dwelling assigned to thy use and excludes the aforementioned and similar classes of buildings. Hence, a cattle-shed, where women stay adorning themselves, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because it also serves as a human habitation. A lodge or porch\\\\u2014either rectangular or circular\\\\u2014leading to a garden, a garden and a sheepfold are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because they are not constructed to serve as residences. If dwellings requiring a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; open to these places, the latter must also have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;8. Hence, entrances, whether leading to courtyards or to passages, and gates of districts or cities, must each have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because dwellings which require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; open on to them. Even where ten rooms open one to the other, each requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; just as the innermost room requires it. This is the reason for the rule that a gate opening from the garden to a courtyard requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;9. A privy, bath-house, ritual bath-house, tannery and similar places are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; because they are not erected to serve as dwellings for honored use. The tabernacle for the feast of Tabernacles, and a room in a ship are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; because they are not made for permanent occupancy. Of two potter\\\&#39;s booths, one leading to the other, the exterior is exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because it is not permanent. Shops in market places are exempt, because they are not intended to be used as residences.&quot;, &quot;10. A dwelling with several doors, although only one is regularly used for coming in and going out, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; affixed to each door. A small door between a dwelling (below) and the attic needs a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Every room in a dwelling, even a room within a room, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; at the entrance of the inner chamber, of the outer chamber and of the house, for they all serve the purpose of residence and are permanent.&quot;, &quot;11. A door between a house of study or synagogue and a private house, if used habitually for entering and leaving, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If a door is between two dwellings, the position of the hinge determines the side on which the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is to be fixed. The side on which the hinge is visible is regarded as the dwelling in reference to which the position of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is decided.&quot;, &quot;12. Where is the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; to be fixed? Within the width of the doorpost, a hand-breadth from the external edge at a height of a third of the elevation of the entrance, counting from the top. If placed higher it is fit in position, provided that it is a hand-breadth lower than the lintel. It should be fixed on the right side of one entering; if placed on the left side, it is unfit for use. A house owned by partners requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;13. A person should pay heed to the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah;&lt;/i&gt; for it is an obligation perpetually binding upon all. Whenever one enters or leaves a home with the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on the doorpost, he will be confronted with the Declaration of God\\\&#39;s Unity, blessed be His holy name; and will remember the love due to God, and will be aroused from his slumbers and his foolish absorption in temporal vanities. He will realize that nothing endures to all eternity save knowledge of the Ruler of the Universe. This thought will immediately restore him to his right senses and he will walk in the paths of righteousness. Our ancient teachers said: He who has phylacteries on his head and arm, fringes on his garment and a Mezuzah on his door may be presumed not to sin, for he has many monitors\\\\u2014angels that save him from sinning, as it is said, (Psalms 34:8) \\\\&quot;The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them\\\\&quot;.&quot;], [&quot;1. It is an affirmative precept binding upon every individual Israelite to write a scroll of the Law for his own use, as it is said, \\\\&quot;Now therefore write ye this Song for you\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:19). As the Torah is not written in separate sections, this text means, \\\\&quot;Write for yourselves the Torah in which this Song is contained.\\\\&quot; Even if one\\\&#39;s ancestors have left a person a scroll, it is a religious duty to write a scroll at his own expense. If he wrote it with his own hand, it is accounted to him as if he had received it from Sinai. If one does not know how to write a scroll, he should get others to write it for him. He who corrects a scroll, even a single letter of it, is regarded as if he had written it completely.&quot;, &quot;2. A king has the duty of writing for himself another scroll of the Law, in his capacity as sovereign, in addition to the scroll which he owns in his private capacity, as it is said, \\\\&quot;And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law, etc.\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:18). This copy is corrected by comparison with a scroll kept in the temple court, and under the authority of the Supreme Judicature. The scroll which the king had possessed when he was a private individual, he places in his archives. The one that he wrote or had written for him when he became king, should always be with him. If he goes to war, the scroll is to be with him. When he enters his home, it is to be with him. When he hears a cause (tries a case) it is to be with him. When he sits down to a meal, it is to be placed before him, as it is said, \\\\&quot;And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:19).&quot;, &quot;3. If he possessed no scroll before he came to the throne, he has to write, after his accession, two scrolls of the law, one of which he places in his archives, while the other is to be always with him. It must never be away from him, except at night, or when he goes to the bath or the lavatory or lies down on his couch to sleep.&quot;, &quot;4. A scroll of the Law that has been written without having been ruled, or that has been written partly on parchment made of whole hide and partly on that made of the inner half of split hide is unfit for use. It must be entirely written either on the former or on the latter. How is a scroll of the law to be written? The scribe is to use the correct script and it should also be exceedingly fine. Between one word and another, he is to leave the space of a small letter; between one letter and another (in the same word) the space of a hair\\\&#39;s breadth; between one line and the next the space of a line. The length of each line is to be thirty letters, wide enough to write the word Le-Mi-Sh-Pe-Ch-O-S-E-Che-M&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*Ten consonant letters printed here in capital letters. See also below.&lt;/i&gt; three times. This is to be the width of each column. No line shall be shorter, so that the column shall not look like an epistle. Nor should any line be wider so that the reader\\\&#39;s eyes should not have to wander across the sheet.&quot;, &quot;5. He should not diminish the size of the characters in order to leave a space between one paragraph and another. When he comes (at the end of a line) to a word of five letters, he must not write two within the column and three outside the column; but he is to write three letters within the column and two outside the column. If there is not enough space left at the end of the line to write three letters, he is to leave it blank and begin at the commencement of the next line.&quot;, &quot;6. If at the end of a line, he has a word of two letters to write, he may not place it between the columns (that is, outside the column) but he writes it at the beginning of the next line. If, before the line is filled up, he has a word of ten letters, more or less, to write and there is not enough space left on the line to write it all within the column, if he is able to write half the word within the column and half outside the column, he may do so. If he cannot do this, he leaves the space blank and writes the word at the beginning of the next line.&quot;, &quot;7. Between each book and the next, he leaves a space of four lines, no more and no less, blank without any writing, and starts the next book at the beginning of the fifth line. When completing the Torah, he is to finish it in the middle of the line at the end of the column. If several lines of the column would be left, he shortens the lines, so as to begin at the beginning of the last line of the column and not complete it, and also so plans the lines that the final words &lt;i&gt;Le-\\\\u00e9n\\\\u00e9 Chol Yisrael&lt;/i&gt; (\\\\&quot;in the sight of all Israel\\\\&quot;) shall be in the middle of the line at the end of the column.&quot;, &quot;8. He should pay careful attention to the letters that are written large or small, to the letters that are punctuated with dots above them, to the letters that are written differently to the others, such as the letter P\\\\u00e9 and the letters that are curved, in the way the scribes have carried on the tradition. He is to pay attention to the tittles&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*lines over each of the letters &lt;i&gt;Shin, Ayin, Teth, Nuen, Zayin, Gimel, Tzadi&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; and the number of them in each case\\\\u2014one letter having above it a single tittle, another having seven tittles. All the tittles have the shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; and are to be thin as a hair.&quot;, &quot;9. All these provisoes are only stated in order that the duty of writing a scroll shall be observed in the most perfect way. If, however the scribe made changes in the method here set forth, was not careful in regard to the tittles, writing however all the letters correctly, or if he wrote the lines close together or far apart, extended the lines or shortened them\\\\u2014since he did not join any letter to another, omit aught or add aught, mar the form of any letter, nor make any variation in regard to which paragraphs should be open and which closed, the scroll is fit for use.&quot;, &quot;10. There are other rules mentioned in the Talmud which the scribes observe as a tradition handed down from one to another. They are as follows: The number of lines in each column shall not be less than forty-eight and not more than sixty; the blank spaces between one section and another shall be such that nine letters, e.g., A She R, A She R, A She R, can be written in it. The five lines preceding the Song at the Red Sea (Exodus 14:28, 29, 30, 30, 31) shall begin respectively with the words &lt;i&gt;Habaim, Bayabashah, Hashem, Mes, Bemitzraim.&lt;/i&gt; The five lines after it shall begin respectively with the words &lt;i&gt;Vatikach, Achareha, Sus, Vayetz\\\\u00eb\\\\u00fc, Vayav\\\\u00f6\\\\u00fc&lt;/i&gt; (Exodus 15:20, 20, 21, 22, 23). The six lines before the Song of Moses beginning &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) shall respectively commence with the words &lt;i&gt;Veaeedah, Achar\\\\u00e9, Haderech, Beacharith, Lehacheeso, Kehal&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 31:28, 29, 29, 29, 29, 30); and the five lines after the Song of Moses shall begin with the words &lt;i&gt;Vayabo, Ledabber, Asher, Hazoth, Asher&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:44, 45, 46, 46, 47). All these points of observance are to enable us to fulfill the duty in the best way. Variations in these particulars do not render the scroll unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;11. But if the scribe wrote &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; a word that should be &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or vice versa; or a word traditionally pronounced differently to the way it is written, according to the traditional pronunciation, for example, if he wrote &lt;i&gt;Yishkevenoh&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Yishgelenoh,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Oovatechorim&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Oova-apolim,&lt;/i&gt; etc.; or if he wrote an \\\\&quot;open\\\\&quot; section as if it were a closed section or vice versa; or if he wrote one of the Songs like the ordinary prose text, or an ordinary section in the form of one of the Songs, the scroll is unfit for use as a scroll of the Law. It has not the sacredness of a scroll of the Law, but is like any one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught.&quot;, &quot;12. A scroll of the Law, which has not been examined for correctness may not be kept longer than thirty days. It must either be corrected or segregated.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*put away and not be used.&lt;/i&gt; A scroll of the Law which has three errors in each column should be corrected. If there are four, it must be put away. If the greater portion has been found to be correct, and the remainder has four errors in each column, but there is even one column in this erroneous portion with less than four errors, corrections could be made.&quot;, &quot;13. This rule only applies to cases where the scribe wrote &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; words that should be written &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; so that he would be under the necessity of inserting the letters that he forgot between the lines. But if he wrote &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; words that are &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; even if every column contains several errors, he corrects them, as he only erases and does not have to insert letters between the lines.&quot;, &quot;14. It is permitted to write the Pentateuch, each book in a separate scroll. These scrolls have not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law that is complete. One may not however write a scroll containing some sections. Such a scroll may not be written for a child\\\&#39;s instruction. This is permitted, however, where there is the intention to complete the remainder of the book. If one wrote such a scroll with three words on each line, this is permitted.&quot;, &quot;15. The Pentateuch, the Prophets and the Hagiography may be put together in one volume. In such a case, a space of four lines is left blank between each book of the Pentateuch and the next; a space of three lines between each of the major Prophets and the next; and a space of three lines between each of the twelve minor prophets and the next, so that he can, if he wishes, separate any book. The order of the prophetical books is as follows: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah, the Twelve Minor Prophets. The order of the books of the Hagiography is: Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel, Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.&quot;, &quot;16. None of The Holy Scriptures may be written except on ruled lines, even if they are written on paper: Three words of Scripture may be written without ruling the line, but to write more is forbidden. A volume containing the Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiography has not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, but of a single book of the Pentateuch. The scroll which contains more than the entire Pentateuch is in the same class as that which contains less than the entire Pentateuch, on the principle that excess is similar to deficiency.&quot;], [&quot;1. The &lt;i&gt;open&lt;/i&gt; section has two forms. If the previous section ended in the middle of a line, the scribe leaves the remainder of the line blank and commences the open section at the beginning of the next line. This only applies to the case where, after the conclusion of the previous section, there is left sufficient space on the line to write nine letters. But if the space left is less, or if the previous section was completed at the end of the line, the next line must be left blank, and the open section is begun at the commencement of the third line.&quot;, &quot;2. A &lt;i&gt;closed&lt;/i&gt; section has three forms. If the previous section ended within the line, the scribe leaves a blank space for the required dimension (enough to write nine letters) and begins the closed section at the end of the line, provided that there is a blank space between it and the preceding section. If the completion of the previous section did not leave space for the blank of the required breadth and for writing (at least) one word at the end of the line, the scribe should leave the remainder of the line blank, leave a little space at the beginning of the next line blank, and begin the closed section within the line. If the previous section ended at the close of the line, he leaves a blank space of the required breadth (nine letters), at the beginning of the next line, and begins to write the closed section within the line. Hence, you may say that an open section always begins within the line.&quot;, &quot;3. A scroll which is inaccurate in regard to words that are written &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; can be made good by being corrected, as already explained. But if the scribe made a mistake in the spacing between the sections, and wrote an open section as if it were a closed section, or a closed section as if it were an open section or left a space where a section does not end, or continued writing without leaving a space where a section ends, or deviated from the form in which the Songs are written, in all these cases, the Scroll is unfit for use and there is no remedy except to remove the entire column in which the mistake occurs.&quot;, &quot;4. As in all the scrolls I have seen, I noticed serious incorrectness in these regards, while authorities on the Massorah, who write treatises and compilations with the aim of pointing out the sections that are closed and those that are open, differ according to the variations in the scrolls on which they rely, I deemed it fit to write here a list of the sections which are closed and those which are open, as also the forms in which the Songs of the Pentateuch are written so that all the scrolls may be corrected from, and compared with them. The copy on which I relied is the well-known Egyptian codex which contains the twenty-four books of the Scriptures and which had been in Jerusalem for several years\\\\u2014used as the standard text for the examination of scrolls. Everyone relied upon it because it had been examined by Ben Asher who closely studied it for many years and examined it again whenever it was being copied. This codex was the text on which I relied in the scroll of the Law that I wrote according to the rules.&quot;, &quot;(Here follow lists of open and closed sections which are in the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 131b to 136b.)&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF GENESIS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 43; of closed sections 48; total 91.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF EXODUS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 69; of closed sections, 95; total 164.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 52; of closed sections, 46; total 98.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF NUMBERS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 92; of closed sections, 66; total 158.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections of this book is 34; of closed sections, 124, total 158. The number of open sections in the entire Pentateuch is 290; of the closed sections, 379; total 669.&quot;, &quot;The form of the Song &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43). Every line has a blank space in the middle, like that preceding a closed section. Hence, every line is divided into two parts. The song is written in 70 lines. The words at the beginning of the lines are as follows:&quot;, &quot;(See the Hebrew text on the right hand side page 136a)&quot;, &quot;All these are the words at the beginning of the lines. And the following are the words at the beginning of the latter half of the line which are in the middle of the column.&quot;, &quot;(See the Hebrew text on the right hand pages 136a and 136b)&quot;, &quot;The Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15:1-19) is written in thirty lines, the first line in the ordinary way; the other lines, one with a blank space in the middle, the next with blank spaces in two places, so that the line is divided into three parts and so a blank space corresponds to writing (above and below it) and vice versa as follows.&quot;, &quot;See the Hebrew text on the right-hand side 136a, 136b and 137a as it should be written in the scroll. The English pages should be blank.&quot;, &quot;Throughout the Torah, in the Songs as well as in the rest of the text, the scribe should aim to write all the letters of each word close together, taking care that no letter should be joined to another, and that no letter should be so far away from the next as to make the word seem two words. The interval between the letters in one word should be a hairbreadth. If the scribe wrote one letter so far apart from the other that it would appear to a child who is not familiar with the text like two words, the scroll is unfit for use till he makes the correction.&quot;], [&quot;1. The length of a scroll of the Law should not exceed the circumference, nor should the circumference exceed the length. What is a suitable length? Where parchment of a whole hide is used, six hand-breadths, that is twenty-four finger-breadths taking the thumb as the standard. Where the parchment of the external half of the hide is used, the length may be more or less than this dimension, provided only that the length is equal to the circumference. So also in the case of parchment of a whole hide, if the scribe made the length less than six hand-breadths and wrote in a small hand or longer than six handbreadths and spread out the writing so that the length of the column is equal to the circumference\\\\u2014this too is correct.&quot;, &quot;2. The extent of the lower margin is four finger-breadths; of the upper margin, three finger-breadths; between one column and another, two finger-breadths. Hence, on the right and left of every sheet of parchment, the scribe has to leave a margin a finger-breadth wide and enough beside for sewing; so that, when the sheets are sewn together, there will be throughout the scroll a blank space of two finger-breadths between the columns. The scribe must leave in addition enough margin at the beginning and end of the scroll to fold a blank column round the rollers. All these dimensions are to be observed in order to fulfill the precept properly. But if the scribe exceeded or fell short of them, he does not render the scroll unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;3. How shall one proceed so that the length of the scroll shall turn out equal to its circumference. The parchment sheets are made evenly rectangular; each sheet being six handbreadths wide, all of the same dimensions. They are rolled evenly into one bundle tightly rolled up. And skins are added and tightly rolled till the circumference is six handbreadths, which is the width of the sheets. This is measured with a thread of wool which is placed round the bundle.&quot;, &quot;4. The scribe then fashions a straight ruler, forty or fifty finger-breadths long; one of these finger-breadths, he marks in two, three and four equal parts so as to be able to measure off a half, a third and a quarter of a finger-breadth and similar fractions. With this, he measures each sheet, so as to ascertain the number of finger-breadths it contains and so determine how many finger-breadths there are in the entire bundle.&quot;, &quot;5. He then takes two or three other sheets of parchment, to test the size of the characters, and writes on them one column. The length of a column of writing is obviously seventeen finger-breadths as a margin must be left, of three finger-breadths above and four finger-breadths below. The width of the column will depend on the handwriting, whether it is large or small. So also, the number of lines will vary according to the handwriting, as between each line and the next, the space of a line must be left.&quot;, &quot;6. Having written the column which he uses as a test as he pleases, he measures its breadth by means of the finger-breadths of the ruler, and adds two finger-breadths for the margin between column and column. He then calculates how many columns of such writing would fill the sheets in the bundle he had made up. Having ascertained the total number of columns, he will then see how much of the entire Pentateuch is in the column which he wrote as a test. He will make the estimate with the aid of the scroll which serves him as a copy, and calculate accordingly. If the number of columns of the kind of writing which he wrote is sufficient for the whole Torah\\\\u2014well and good. If the calculation showed that there are more columns than are required for the whole Torah, he will enlarge the writing, so as to diminish the number of columns, and he will make a test with another column. If the calculation shows that for the writing of the Torah more columns will be required than are contained in his sheets, he will use smaller characters and so secure a larger number of columns. He will make the test with column after column till the calculation comes out exact.&quot;, &quot;7. Once he knows the width of the column and the size of the characters, he can begin writing the scroll with that bundle of sheets. He then divides the parchment (sheets) into columns by ruling them off,\\\\u2014each column of the same width as that which his tests and calculations showed to be the right size. If three or four finger-breadths are left over beyond the last column, he should leave one finger-breadth and enough besides for sewing the sheet to the next, and cut off the rest, and need feel no apprehension, for at the end, more sheets will be added to make up for the superfluous strips that he cut off from each sheet. Nor need he make any calculations in regard to this, for the writing will be according to the number of columns.&quot;, &quot;8. So too, if one wishes to make the width of the scroll more or less than six handbreadths, he makes his calculation in the same way; and the length will be exactly equal to the circumference neither more nor less, provided that no mistake has been made in the calculation.&quot;, &quot;9. The finger-breadth in all the dimensions here and in the rest of the Torah is that of the medium sized finger. On careful examination, we find it to be the breadth of seven medium sized barley corns placed close together, this being equal to the length of two barley corns measured liberally. The handbreadth, wherever mentioned, is equal to four such finger-breadths. A cubit is six handbreadths.&quot;, &quot;10. The scroll which I wrote had a width of four finger-breadths to each column. The columns containing the Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15.1-18) &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) were each six finger-breadths wide. The number of lines in each column were fifty-one. The number of columns in the whole scroll were 226 columns. The length of the entire scroll was 13366 finger-breadths approximately.&quot;, &quot;11. The six finger-breadths left over were for the margin at the beginning and end of the scroll. The parchment skins on which we wrote were ramskins. Whenever you desire to write a scroll and follow these measurements completely or approximately, you need not weary yourself to make a calculation if you have one, two or three columns less or more; you will find that the length will be equal to the circumference.&quot;, &quot;12. No sheet should have less than three, nor more than eight columns. If a sheet is wide enough to contain nine columns, it is cut into two parts, one to contain four columns, the other to contain five columns. This rule applies to the beginning and middle of the scroll. But at the close, even if there is only left one verse to write on a column, that column is prepared on a separate sheet and sewn on to the other sheets.&quot;, &quot;13. For sewing the sheets together, only the sinews of a clean beast domestic or wild, including those that are &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt; (literally torn), flesh of a beast that had suffered from a mortal lesion.&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\\\u2014flesh of a beast that had died or had not been slaughtered, or had been slaughtered by an unqualified or disqualified person.&lt;/i&gt; may be used. The law here is the same as in regard to phylacteries. This rule goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. Hence if the sheets have been sewn together but not with sinews or with sinews of an unclean animal, the scroll is unfit for use till the stitches are taken out and the sewing is done according to rule.&quot;, &quot;14. When the sheets are sewn together, they are sewn entirely from top to bottom, but a small portion is left above and below without being stitched, so that the scroll, when it is rolled up, may not be torn in the middle. Two wooden rollers are prepared, one for either end. The unwritten margins of parchment at the beginning and at the end are brought round the rollers and sewn with sinews, so that the scroll can be rolled over them; a clear space being left between the margin and the writing in the columns.&quot;, &quot;15. In case a scroll of the law had one of its sheets torn, the rent is sewn up, if it extends to two lines; if it extends to three lines, it is not sewn up. This rule applies to a scroll the gall dressing of which is no longer perceptible. But if the parchment still shows that it has been dressed, then, even when the rent extends to three lines, it is sewn up. So too, a rent between columns or between words is sewn up. For the stitching of the rents, the same kind of sinews are used as for the sheets. And wherever there is a rent, the scribe should make sure that no letter is missing or altered in form.&quot;], [&quot;1. You thus find that there are twenty factors, any one of which disqualifies a scroll of the law. If any of these occurs, the scroll is like one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught. It does not possess the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, and is not used for reading in public worship. They are as follows:&quot;, &quot;1) If it was written on the skin of a beast of an unclean species;&quot;, &quot;2) or on the skin of a beast of a clean species, which had not been tanned;&quot;, &quot;3) If the skin had been tanned but not for the express purpose of being used as a scroll of the law;&quot;, &quot;4) If it was written on the wrong side; in the case of parchment of whole hide on the side next to the flesh; in the case of parchment of the outer half of a split hide, on the side adjacent to the hair;&quot;, &quot;5) If it was written partly on parchment of whole hide and partly on that made of the outer half of split hide;&quot;, &quot;6) If it was written on the inner half of a split hide;&quot;, &quot;7) If it was written without the lines having been previously ruled;&quot;, &quot;8) If it was written with a dark writing fluid that does not make a permanent impression;&quot;, &quot;9) If it was written in other languages;&quot;, &quot;10) If it was written by a heretic (Epikouros) or other disqualified persons;&quot;, &quot;11) If the scribe wrote the names of God without special concentration of mind;&quot;, &quot;12) If a single letter was omitted;&quot;, &quot;13) If a single letter was added;&quot;, &quot;14) If one letter touched another;&quot;, &quot;15)\\\\tIf a single letter was so marred that it cannot be read at all, or resembles another letter, whether the defect is in the writing, or is due to a perforation, rent or smudge;&quot;, &quot;16)\\\\tIf the scribe wrote letters so far apart or so closely together that one word looks like two words or two words look like one word;&quot;, &quot;17)\\\\tIf he altered the form of the sections&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*Wrote an \\\\u201copen\\\\u201d section as if it were a \\\\u201cclosed\\\\u201d section or vice versa.&lt;/i&gt;;&quot;, &quot;18)\\\\tIf he varied the form of writing the Songs;&quot;, &quot;19)\\\\tIf he wrote any other portion in the form of a Song;&quot;, &quot;20)\\\\tIf he did not sew the sheets with sinews of a beast of a clean species.&quot;, &quot;The other conditions stated are recommended as the best way of performing the duty of writing a scroll. Their non-observance does not render it unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;2. A scroll of the law that is fit for use is to be regarded as an object of extreme holiness and treated with great reverence. A person is forbidden to sell a scroll of the law even if he has nothing to eat, and even if he owns other scrolls. He may not even sell an old scroll, to buy a new one. A scroll may only be sold for one of two purposes, to provide means to enable one to study Torah or to marry\\\\u2014and then only if the owner has nothing else that he can sell.&quot;, &quot;3. If a scroll of the law has become worn out or been otherwise rendered unfit for use; it is placed in an earthenware vessel and buried beside the remains of deceased scholars. This is the appropriate method of \\\\&quot;concealing\\\\&quot; it (putting it away). Folders of scrolls that have become worn out are used as shrouds for the dead (found on the road) whose interment is a duty binding on all. This is the appropriate method of \\\\&quot;concealing\\\\&quot; them.&quot;, &quot;4. A case specially made for a scroll of the law and in which it has been placed, bands around the scrolls, the chest or structure in which it is deposited even though the scroll is in its case, as also a bench specially made on which to place a scroll of the law, and on which a scroll was placed are all subsidiaries of that which is sacred, and may not be thrown away. When worn out or broken, they are \\\\&quot;put away\\\\&quot;. The platforms, however, on which the Reader of the congregation stands and holds the scroll and tablets on which (scriptures) are written for a child\\\&#39;s instruction have no sanctity. Golden and silver pomegranates and other such ornaments, made for the embellishment of a scroll of the law are subsidiaries of that which is sacred; and it is forbidden to part with them to be used for secular purposes, unless they were sold with the intention to purchase with their proceeds a scroll of the law or a book of the Pentateuch.&quot;, &quot;5. It is permitted to place one scroll of the law upon another scroll, or, needless to add, upon single books of the Pentateuch. Single books of the Pentateuch may be placed upon books of the Prophets or Hagiography. But the books of the prophets and of the Hagiography are not placed upon single books of the Pentateuch; nor the latter on a scroll of the law. No sacred writings, not even Halachas or Hagadas (Legalistic or Homiletic works) may be thrown away. Amulets which contain scriptural matter, must not be taken with one into a lavatory (privy) unless they are covered with a skin.&quot;, &quot;6. A person may not, while bearing a scroll of the law in his arms, enter a bath-house, lavatory, or cemetery, even if the scroll is swathed in folders and placed in its case. A person must not read in it till he has moved away four cubits from the dead body (bath house) or lavatory. One may not hold a scroll of the law when nude. It is forbidden to sit down on a couch on which there is a scroll of the law.&quot;, &quot;7. Cohabitation is forbidden in a chamber where there is a scroll of the law, till it has been removed or placed in a receptacle which is itself placed in a receptacle not specially assigned to the scroll. If it has however been so assigned, even ten receptacles within each other, are regarded as a single receptacle. If a partition, ten handbreadths high, has been constructed for the scroll, cohabitation may take place if there is no other room. It may not take place, if there is another room, till the scroll has been removed.&quot;, &quot;8. All who are ritually unclean, even women in their menstruating period, and even a non-Israelite, may hold a scroll of the law and read in it, for the words of the Torah do not contract uncleanliness, provided that the holder\\\&#39;s hands are not dirty or soiled. They must therefore wash their hands and then they may touch it.&quot;, &quot;9. Every one who sees a person carrying a scroll of the law and proceeding with it must stand up before it; and all persons continue standing till the bearer of the scroll stops, having carried it to its appointed place, or passes out of sight. They are then permitted to resume their seats.&quot;, &quot;10. It is a duty to assign a fixed place for a scroll of the law, and to show it extreme honor and courtesy. The words in the tables of the covenant are in every scroll of the law. One may not expectorate before a scroll of the law, nor indecently expose oneself before it, nor stretch out one\\\&#39;s feet before it; nor place it upon the head in the way in which a burden is carried; nor turn one\\\&#39;s back to it unless it is at an elevation of ten handbreadths above the person.&quot;, &quot;11. If one is travelling from place to place and had a scroll of the law with him, he is not to put the scroll in a sack, place it on the donkey\\\&#39;s back and ride upon it. If, however, he is afraid of thieves, he may do so. When there is no such apprehension, he places it in his bosom close to his heart, and continues his journey, riding. Any one, sitting before a scroll of the law, should be inspired with a sense of earnestness, awe and reverence, for it is a faithful witness concerning all who come into the world, as it is said, \\\\&quot;It shall be therefore a witness against thee\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:26). All possible honor should be shown it. The ancient sages said, \\\\&quot;Whoever treats the Torah with contumely will be treated with contumely by his fellow-creatures. Whoever honors the Torah, will receive honor from his fellow creatures\\\\&quot; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:8). End of the laws concerning the scroll of the Law by the Grace of God.&quot;]], &quot;versionTitle&quot;: &quot;The Mishneh Torah by Maimonides. trans. by Moses Hyamson, 1937-1949&quot;, &quot;versionSource&quot;: &quot;http://primo.nli.org.il/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=NLI&amp;docId=NNL_ALEPH002108865&quot;, &quot;language&quot;: &quot;en&quot;}\&#39;], u\&#39;apikey\&#39;: [u\&#39;kAEw7OKw5IjZIG4lFbrYxpSdu78Jsza67HgR0gRBOdg\&#39;]}&gt;,\nCOOKIES:{},\nMETA:{\&#39;Apple_PubSub_Socket_Render\&#39;: \&#39;/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.wIoRvVS90z/Render\&#39;,\n \&#39;CONTENT_LENGTH\&#39;: \&#39;102187\&#39;,\n \&#39;CONTENT_TYPE\&#39;: \&#39;application/x-www-form-urlencoded\&#39;,\n \&#39;CSRF_COOKIE\&#39;: \&#39;RAGgVMcQmDGIQeQTVQiBoTUzHqwMLDTq\&#39;,\n \&#39;DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\&#39;: \&#39;sefaria.settings\&#39;,\n \&#39;GATEWAY_INTERFACE\&#39;: \&#39;CGI/1.1\&#39;,\n \&#39;HOME\&#39;: \&#39;/Users/stevenkaplan\&#39;,\n \&#39;HTTP_ACCEPT\&#39;: \&#39;*/*\&#39;,\n \&#39;HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING\&#39;: \&#39;gzip, deflate\&#39;,\n \&#39;HTTP_CONNECTION\&#39;: \&#39;keep-alive\&#39;,\n \&#39;HTTP_HOST\&#39;: \&#39;localhost:8000\&#39;,\n \&#39;HTTP_USER_AGENT\&#39;: \&#39;python-requests/2.5.0 CPython/2.7.10 Darwin/15.6.0\&#39;,\n \&#39;LANG\&#39;: \&#39;en_US.UTF-8\&#39;,\n \&#39;LOGNAME\&#39;: \&#39;stevenkaplan\&#39;,\n \&#39;OLDPWD\&#39;: \&#39;/Users/stevenkaplan\&#39;,\n \&#39;PATH\&#39;: \&#39;/Users/stevenkaplan/Desktop/mongodb/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/stevenkaplan/.rvm/bin\&#39;,\n \&#39;PATH_INFO\&#39;: u\&#39;/api/texts/Mishneh_Torah,_Tefillin,_Mezuzah_and_the_Torah_Scroll\&#39;,\n \&#39;PWD\&#39;: \&#39;/Users/stevenkaplan/Documents/sefaria stuff/Sefaria-Project\&#39;,\n \&#39;QUERY_STRING\&#39;: \&#39;count_after=1\&#39;,\n \&#39;REMOTE_ADDR\&#39;: \&#39;127.0.0.1\&#39;,\n \&#39;REMOTE_HOST\&#39;: \&#39;\&#39;,\n \&#39;REQUEST_METHOD\&#39;: \&#39;POST\&#39;,\n \&#39;RUN_MAIN\&#39;: \&#39;true\&#39;,\n \&#39;SCRIPT_NAME\&#39;: u\&#39;\&#39;,\n \&#39;SERVER_NAME\&#39;: \&#39;1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa\&#39;,\n \&#39;SERVER_PORT\&#39;: \&#39;8000\&#39;,\n \&#39;SERVER_PROTOCOL\&#39;: \&#39;HTTP/1.1\&#39;,\n \&#39;SERVER_SOFTWARE\&#39;: \&#39;WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.7.10\&#39;,\n \&#39;SHELL\&#39;: \&#39;/bin/bash\&#39;,\n \&#39;SHLVL\&#39;: \&#39;1\&#39;,\n \&#39;SSH_AUTH_SOCK\&#39;: \&#39;/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.3fwTqDs8KP/Listeners\&#39;,\n \&#39;TERM\&#39;: \&#39;xterm-256color\&#39;,\n \&#39;TERM_PROGRAM\&#39;: \&#39;Apple_Terminal\&#39;,\n \&#39;TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION\&#39;: \&#39;361.1\&#39;,\n \&#39;TERM_SESSION_ID\&#39;: \&#39;5367DE0D-9911-4CF5-BC9C-D8F8166E95FA\&#39;,\n \&#39;TMPDIR\&#39;: \&#39;/var/folders/__/bj5ng_3n4hdb5xxcqdy6xm_80000gn/T/\&#39;,\n \&#39;TZ\&#39;: \&#39;America/Vancouver\&#39;,\n \&#39;USER\&#39;: \&#39;stevenkaplan\&#39;,\n \&#39;VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT\&#39;: \&#39;no\&#39;,\n \&#39;VERSIONER_PYTHON_VERSION\&#39;: \&#39;2.7\&#39;,\n \&#39;XPC_FLAGS\&#39;: \&#39;0x0\&#39;,\n \&#39;XPC_SERVICE_NAME\&#39;: \&#39;0\&#39;,\n \&#39;_\&#39;: \&#39;/usr/bin/python\&#39;,\n \&#39;__CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING\&#39;: \&#39;0x1F5:0x0:0x0\&#39;,\n \&#39;wsgi.errors\&#39;: &lt;open file \&#39;&lt;stderr&gt;\&#39;, mode \&#39;w\&#39; at 0x1035631e0&gt;,\n \&#39;wsgi.file_wrapper\&#39;: &lt;class wsgiref.util.FileWrapper at 0x104112a10&gt;,\n \&#39;wsgi.input\&#39;: &lt;socket._fileobject object at 0x114d636d0&gt;,\n \&#39;wsgi.multiprocess\&#39;: False,\n \&#39;wsgi.multithread\&#39;: True,\n \&#39;wsgi.run_once\&#39;: False,\n \&#39;wsgi.url_scheme\&#39;: \&#39;http\&#39;,\n \&#39;wsgi.version\&#39;: (1, 0)}&gt;&#39;</pre></td>

The four Pentateuchal sections, beginning respectively, \\&quot;Sanctify unto me\\&quot; (Ex. 13:1-10), \\&quot;And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee\\&quot; (Exodus 13:11-16)\\u2014these two being in the Book of Exodus, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) \\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13-21), are written and covered with a skin. These are called &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; and are placed upon the head and bound on the arm. The omission of the point of a single letter in any one of these sections bars, according to Scriptural enactment, the use of all of them. They must all be written perfectly and in accordance with rule.&quot;, &quot;2. This is the case also with the two sections of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; beginning respectively, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) and \\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). If the point of a letter is missing in these two sections, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may not, according to Scriptural enactment, be used. The two sections must be written perfectly. So too, a scroll of the Law, in which a single letter is missing, is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;3. There are ten points in regard to &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; (phylacteries). The observance of each is enjoined by a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. The neglect of any of them is an absolute bar to the use of the &lt;i&gt;Tephillin.&lt;/i&gt; Hence, if there was a variation in any one of them, the &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; are unfit for use. Two of these have reference to the writing; eight, to the covering and the tying of the straps. The two points to be observed in the writing are that the sections must be written with ink, and must be written on parchment.&quot;, &quot;4. How is the ink prepared? Soot of oils or of pitch, wax or similar substance is collected; kneaded with gum of trees and a little honey; thoroughly wetted and pounded till it is like wafers. It is then stored away. When the scribe wishes to write, he soaks it in water in which gall-apples or similar substances have been steeped, and with this fluid he writes. Such writing when erased leaves no mark. This is the best way to write scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs.&lt;/i&gt; If the scribe has written with fluid of the gall-oak or of caper,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Caper: flower-buds or seeds of a low shrub of Mediterranean countries, used as a condiment.&lt;/i&gt; since the writing stays and is not rubbed out, scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; so written are fit for use.&quot;, &quot;5. This being so, what is excluded by the Halacha, dating back to Moses, which ordains that these must be written with ink? It excludes pigments of other colors, such as red or green, etc.; so that if even a single letter in a scroll of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; was written with pigment of any other color [but black] or with gold, such a Scroll, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;6. There are three kinds of parchment, &lt;i&gt;Gewil, Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Duxustus.&lt;/i&gt; How are these made? A hide of domestic cattle or wild beast is taken. First, its hair is removed. It is then pickled in salt, afterwards prepared with flour and subsequently tanned with gall-wood or similar materials which contract the pores of the hide and make it durable. And this it is that is called &lt;i&gt;Gewil&lt;/i&gt; (parchment of whole-hide leather).&quot;, &quot;7. If, after removing the hair, the hide had been split through its thickness into two parts, so as to make of it two skins, one thin, namely that which had been next to the hair; the other thick, namely that which had been next to the flesh, and if these were prepared first with salt, then with flour and afterwards with gall-wood or similar substance the skin which had been next to the hair is called &lt;i&gt;Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; (= outer-skin parchment), and that which had been next to the flesh is called &lt;i&gt;Duxustus&lt;/i&gt; (inner-skin parchment).&quot;, &quot;8. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that the scroll of the Law should be written on &lt;i&gt;Gewil&lt;/i&gt; (whole hide parchment), and the writing should be on the side which had been next to the hair. The &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; should be written on &lt;i&gt;Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; (the exterior part of the split hide) and the writing should be on the side which had been nearer the flesh; and the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; should be written on &lt;i&gt;Duxustus&lt;/i&gt; (made of the inner part of the split hide), on the side which had been nearer the hair. If, on a &lt;i&gt;Kelaf,&lt;/i&gt; one writes on the side that had been next to the hair, or, on a &lt;i&gt;Gewil or Duxustus,&lt;/i&gt; one writes on the side that had been next to the flesh, the Scroll, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; so written is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;9. Though this is the rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai, yet if one writes a scroll of the Law on parchment made from the exterior half of a split hide it is fit for use. The reason why a complete hide is mentioned is in order to exclude that made from the inner half of the split hide. If one wrote on it a scroll of the Law, it is unfit for use. So also, if one wrote a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on the external half of a split hide or on an undivided hide, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use. The inner half of a split hide is recommended to be used, only as a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (specially approved).&quot;, &quot;10. Scrolls, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; are not written on the hide of a domestic or wild beast that is unclean or on the skin of an unclean bird. They are written on the hides of domestic or wild beasts that are clean or on the skins of clean birds, even when the flesh of these animals may not be eaten owing to their not having been slaughtered according to the ritual or being found to have suffered from a lesion of a mortal character. Nor are Scrolls, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; written on the skin of a fish, even if it be of a clean species, because of its foulness. For this is not removed by tanning.&quot;, &quot;11. The undivided skin for a scroll of the Law, and the external half of the hide to be used for &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or for a scroll of the Law must be tanned for their specific purposes. If they were not expressly so tanned, they are not fit for use. Accordingly, if a non-Israelite or a Samaritan tanned them, they are unfit for use. Even if the Samaritan was instructed to tan a particular hide for the purpose of its being used for a scroll of the Law or &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; it is unfit for use; since he works with his own purposes in mind, not with those of his employer. Hence, anything that has to be done with a purpose in mind, if done by a Samaritan, is unfit for use. The skin for a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; does not require to be tanned for that express purpose.&quot;, &quot;12. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that a scroll of the Law or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may only be written on parchment that is ruled. Phylacteries need not be ruled, because they are covered. So too, phylacteries and a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may be written from memory, as these sections are recited by and are familiar to everyone. But not a single letter may be written in a scroll of the Law, except from a written copy of the text.&quot;, &quot;13. A scroll of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; written by a heretic must be burnt. If written by a Samaritan, by a Jew converted to another faith, by one who surrenders Israelites to tyrants, by a slave, woman or minor, they are unfit for use, and must be hidden; for it is said, \\&quot;And thou shalt bind them\\&quot;, \\&quot;And thou shalt write them\\&quot;. The implication is that only that person is qualified to write them, who is charged with the duty of putting on &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and believes in the obligation. If they are found in the possession of a heretic, and it is not known who wrote them, they should be hidden. If found in the possession of a Samaritan or non-Israelite, they are fit to be used. Scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; are not to be bought from non-Israelites for more than their value, so as not to accustom the latter to steal these holy articles or take them by force.&quot;, &quot;14. A scroll of the Law, phylacteries or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth,&lt;/i&gt; written on the skin of a beast or bird\\u2014whether domestic or wild\\u2014which belongs to an unclean species, or written on skins that have not been tanned, and likewise a scroll of the Law or phylacteries written on skins not expressly tanned for those purposes, are unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;15. If one who writes a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; had not concentrated his mind while writing, and wrote one of the Names of God without express intent, these articles are unfit for use. Accordingly, when one is writing the name of God, even if an Israelite king greets him, he must not return the greeting. If he is writing two or three names of God, he may pause between writing one and writing the others and may respond.&quot;, &quot;16. After dipping the pen in ink to write the Name of God, the scribe does not start with a letter of the name but with a letter of the previous word. If he altogether forgot to write the name of God, he writes it above the line. But to write part of the name on the line and part above the line makes the scroll unfit for use. Other words that the scribe forgot to write may be written partly on the line and partly above it. These rules apply to a scroll of the Law. But in a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; or in phylacteries not a letter may be written above the line. If the scribe forgot even one letter, he must hide what he wrote and write a fresh slip. In all of them (Scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; and Phylacteries) it is permissible to write the name of God upon a surface from which writing has been erased or obliterated.&quot;, &quot;17. Scribes of scrolls, phylacteries and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; are forbidden to turn over the parchment sheet with its written surface beneath touching the board on which it lies, but should cover it with a cloth or fold it.&quot;, &quot;18. If, after a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; had passed out of the scribe\&#39;s hands, he makes the statement, \\&quot;I did not write the name of God in them with that purpose distinctly in mind\\&quot;, he is not believed to the extent of rendering them unfit for use, but his statement is accepted so far that he forfeits his entire remuneration. The reason why he is not believed so as to render them unfit for use is because his motive may possibly have been to cause a loss to the person who bought or hired them. It would seem however that his statement would only cause him to forfeit that quota of remuneration to which the writing of the names of God would entitle him. Hence, if he stated, \\&quot;the skins of this scroll of the Law or of these phylacteries were not expressly tanned for those purposes\\&quot;, then since in such a case he is believed so fully that he forfeits the whole of his remuneration, his statement is also credited so as to disqualify the articles from being used\\u2014it being a matter of general knowledge that if the skins had not been expressly tanned for the purpose of being made into phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, the scribe receives no remuneration whatsoever.&quot;, &quot;19. Phylacteries and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; may only be written in square Hebrew script. Permission was also given to write scrolls of the Law in Greek characters but not in those of any other foreign tongue. The ancient Greek script has gone out of use, been corrupted and become obsolete. Hence, at the present day, all three religious articles,\\u2014Scroll of the Law, Tephillin and Mezuzah,\\u2014are only written in the square Hebrew script. Care must be taken in writing that no letter shall adhere to any other letter; for any letter which is not completely surrounded on all four sides by a blank space of parchment has been improperly written. Any letter that cannot be read by a child of ordinary intelligence\\u2014not particularly bright or dull\\u2014is improperly written. Thus a &lt;i&gt;Yod&lt;/i&gt; must not be like a &lt;i&gt;Vav&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Vav&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Yod,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Koph&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Beth,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Beth&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Koph,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Daleth&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Resh,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Resh&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Daleth,&lt;/i&gt; etc., so that the reader may be able to read fluently.&quot;, &quot;20. If the parchment was perforated, the scribe must not write on the perforation. A perforation over which the ink passes is not regarded as a perforation, and it is permitted to write across it. Hence, it is permitted to write on the skin of a bird that has been tanned. Should the parchment have become perforated, after it has been written on, if the perforation is in the interior of a letter, as, for example, in a &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mem,&lt;/i&gt; etc., it is regarded as properly written. Should one of the sides of a letter have been perforated, so that the letter is divided\\u2014then the rule is that if there is left of the part that is unperforated as much as would form a small letter, it is regarded as properly written, provided that it does not resemble a different letter. If the part that is left unperforated is not as much as would form a small letter, it is not regarded as properly written.&quot;], [&quot;1. How are the sections in the phylactery that is placed on the head to be written? The four sections are respectively written on four separate slips of parchment; each slip is rolled up separately and they are then placed in four compartments composed of one skin. As to the phylactery placed on the arm, these four sections are written in four columns on one slip of parchment. This slip is rolled up like a scroll of the Law from the last column to the first and is placed in one [leather] compartment.&quot;, &quot;2. The scribe must exercise care in writing these sections, for if he wrote a closed section as an open one,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*that is, began the section on a new line where only a space of nine letters should have been left blank.&lt;/i&gt; or wrote an open section as if it were closed, the slip is unfit for use. The first three sections are, all of them, open. The last section, that beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass, if ye will hearken diligently\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is closed.&quot;, &quot;3. He must exercise care in regard to the words that are &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**with or without a &lt;i&gt;Yod&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Vav,&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&lt;/i&gt; that all the four sections should be written as they are in an examined scroll of the Law. For if he wrote a word &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; that should have been written &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; the slip is unfit for use till the superfluous letter has been obliterated. If a word that is &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; has been written &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; the slip is unfit for use and cannot be made good. The following is the list of the words in these four sections that are &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&quot;, &quot;[&lt;i&gt;For paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 (lists of&lt;/i&gt; plene &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; defective &lt;i&gt;words), see the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 121b and 122a&lt;/i&gt;.]&quot;, &quot;6. The &lt;i&gt;Ayin&lt;/i&gt; of Shema and &lt;i&gt;Daleth&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Echad&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 6:4) are to be written in larger type.&quot;, &quot;8. He must pay attention to the \\&quot;crowns\\&quot; (tittles) above the letters. These are like an upright &lt;i&gt;Zayin&lt;/i&gt; and are placed on each letter to which such a crown belongs as written in the scroll of the Law. The following are the letters in the four sections thus ornamented:&quot;, &quot;9. In the first section, there is only one such letter, namely the closed &lt;i&gt;Mem&lt;/i&gt; in Meeyamim which has over it three &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. In the second section, there are five letters, each of them a &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9;&lt;/i&gt; and on each, there are four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. These are the &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Unesanah; the first and the last &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Hikshah; the &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Vayaharog; the &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Yadchah.&quot;, &quot;10. The third section has five such letters. The &lt;i&gt;Koof&lt;/i&gt; in Uvekoomecha has over it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines; the &lt;i&gt;Koof&lt;/i&gt; in Ukeshartam has over it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines; the two letters &lt;i&gt;Teth,&lt;/i&gt; and the letter &lt;i&gt;P\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Letotaphoth have on each of them four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines.&quot;, &quot;11. The fourth section has five such letters. The &lt;i&gt;P\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; of Veasaphta has above it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. The &lt;i&gt;Tav&lt;/i&gt; of Veasaphta has one &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped line. The two letters &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; and the letter &lt;i&gt;P\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Letotaphoth have on each of them four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. Altogether, the letters thus ornamented are sixteen. If the scribe wholly omitted these ornaments, added to them or omitted them over some of the letters, he has not rendered the phylacteries unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;12. If one buys phylacteries from one who is not a recognized expert, he has to examine them. If he bought from him one hundred parchment slips, he examines three slips, either two of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the arm or two slips of those in the phylacteries worn on the arm and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head. If he found all these three correct, a presumption is established in the vendor\&#39;s favour, and all his phylacteries are fit for use and the rest need not be examined. If he bought them however in several bundles, this examination (of three slips) must take place in each bundle, there being a presumption that the several bundles came from different individuals.&quot;, &quot;13. A man who wrote phylacteries with his own hand or purchased them from an expert or, having bought them of a non-expert, examined them and replaced them in their leather containers, need never re-examine them, even after the lapse of many years. As long as the leather container remains sound, the presumption that they are sound holds good. Nor is it apprehended that a letter has been obliterated or perforated. Hillel the Elder was wont to say, \\&quot;These phylacteries belonged to my mother\&#39;s father.\\&quot;&quot;], [&quot;1. There are eight rules for the making of phylacteries; all of them are traditionally ascribed to Moses who received them on Sinai; hence the observance of all of them is indispensable. A variation from any of them renders the phylacteries unfit for use. The rules are as follows: The phylacteries (that is, the external leather containers) must be square; they are to be sewn in such a way as to retain the square shape; their diagonals must be those of a square so that all the angles shall be equal; the leather container of the phylactery for the head shall have the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; embossed on the right and on the left side; each of the slips of parchment on which the sections from the Pentateuch are written is to be wrapt in a cover; this is to be tied with hair, and then the slips are placed in their respective compartments which are sewn up with sinews; a border with a fold open at both ends shall be made of the skin of the base for the strap to pass through freely; the straps shall be black, and have the special knot, that is known to all, in the shape of a &lt;i&gt;Daleth.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;2. How is the phylactery for the head made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length, breadth and height. It is of no consequence however if the height is more than the breadth or less. What is essential is that the length and breadth shall be equal. Three grooves are cut in the block so that it is divided into four parts as in this figure &lt;img src=\\&quot;data:image/jpg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEBLAEsAAD/2wBDAAUDBAQEAwUEBAQFBQUGBwwIBwcHBw8LCwkMEQ8SEhEP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\\nClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUH//Z\\n\\&quot;&gt;. A piece of leather is taken and soaked in water. The wooden block is put in it and the leather is inserted into each groove. While it is still damp, it is crinkled on both sides, to make a shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; with three lines on the right side of the wearer and with four lines on the left side.&quot;, &quot;3. The leather is left on the wood till it dries; it is then slipped off from the wooden block, with the result that it has the shape of four compartments. The prescribed sections of Scripture written on slips of parchment are placed, one in each compartment. A portion of the leather is drawn round and beneath the cube (to form its base). This is sewn up at its four sides. A portion is left in this skin at the base for the strap to pass through as in a loop. This it is which is called the bridge.&quot;, &quot;4. How are the phylacteries for the arm made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length and breadth. It is to be a finger-breadth in height, or a little more or less. The block is covered with wet leather which is left on till it dries. It is then removed, and in the place where the wood had been, a single slip of parchment on which the four prescribed sections of Scripture are written, is inserted. A portion of the leather is drawn round below and is sewn up at its four sides. Of this base a part is left to form a loop for the strap to pass through.&quot;, &quot;5. What is the order in which the sections are placed in the phylactery for the head? The last section, that beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye will hearken diligently\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is placed in the first compartment, to the right of the wearer; the section beginning, \\&quot;Hear O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4) in the compartment adjacent to it; the section beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God will bring thee\\&quot; (Exodus 13:11), next to the one containing the section, \\&quot;Hear O Israel\\&quot;, and the section beginning, \\&quot;Sanctify unto me every first born\\&quot; (Exodus 13:1) in the fourth compartment which would be to the left of the wearer of the phylactery; so that anyone facing the wearer and reading what is before him would read the sections in the right Scriptural order as in the annexed figure. If there&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Sections beginning with verse:&lt;/i&gt; was a deviation from this order, the phylacteries are not fit for use.&quot;, &quot;6. The sections for the phylactery for the arm are written in four columns on one long strip of parchment like a scroll of the Law, and in the order in which they are found in the Pentateuch as in the annexed figure.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**Sections beginning with verse:&lt;/i&gt; If the scribe wrote them on four separate slips and placed them in one compartment, he has done what is required, and need not attach them to each other.&quot;, &quot;7. When he rolls up the parchment slips containing the sections, for the phylacteries worn on the head or on the arm, he rolls them from the end to the beginning so that, if opened, each section can be read from the beginning to the end.&quot;, &quot;8. When the slips are about to be placed in their respective compartments, they are wrapped in a cloth, over which they are fastened with hair. They are then deposited in their compartments. This hair must be that of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species; and may even be taken from animals which are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;***&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;***&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014died of itself or, by extension of meaning, not properly killed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;\\u2020&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;\\u2020&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014torn by wild beast; by extension of meaning, found to have suffered from mortal disease or lesion.&lt;/i&gt; The custom that has come into general use is to fasten the slips with hair taken from calves\&#39; tails.&quot;, &quot;9. The leather receptacles of the phylacteries are only sewn with sinews of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species, and may be taken from animals of such species even if they are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014died of itself or, by extension of meaning, not properly killed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014torn by wild beast; by extension of meaning, found to have suffered from mortal disease or lesion.&lt;/i&gt; The sinews used are those found in the heel of the domestic or wild beast, which are white and tough. They are softened by pounding them with stones or similar substances, till they become like flax. They are spun and twined, and then used for sewing the phylacteries and the sheets of the scrolls of the Law.&quot;, &quot;10. The receptacles are to be sewn in such a way as to preserve the square contour of the base. It is a broadly established rule that on each side, there are to be three stitches, making altogether twelve stitches, whether the phylactery is for the arm or for the head. If the scribe desires to make ten or fourteen stitches, he may do so. The stitch must pass through the leather on both sides.&quot;, &quot;11. The grooves of the phylacteries for the head ought to extend to the base where the stitching is done. If the grooves are recognizable so that the four divisions clearly appear, the phylacteries are fit for use, even though the grooves do not extend to the base. If however the grooves are not recognizable, the phylacteries are unfit for use. Within each groove, above the leather, a thread or cord ought to be passed so as to separate the compartments from each other. The general custom is to draw through each of the three grooves a sinew of the same kind as those used for the stitches.&quot;, &quot;12. How are the thongs fixed? A strip of leather is taken as wide as the length of a barley corn. If wider, it is fit for use. The length of the strap of the phylactery for the head should be sufficient to encircle the head, form the knot and leave enough for the straps on either side to reach to the navel or a little higher. The strap for the phylactery of the arm should be sufficiently long to encircle the forearm, form the knot, extend down to the middle finger, about which it is to be wound three times and then fastened. If the straps exceed in length the foregoing dimensions, they are also fit for use.&quot;, &quot;13. The thong of the phylactery for the head is inserted in the loop open at both ends. It is measured to fit the wearer\&#39;s head, and then tied in a rectangular knot like a &lt;i&gt;Daleth.&lt;/i&gt; This knot, every scholar should learn how to make. It is impossible to teach its form by description; this can only be taught by ocular demonstration. In the case of the phylactery for the arm, the thong is tied in a knot in the shape of a &lt;i&gt;Yod.&lt;/i&gt; The thong of the phylactery for the arm should move freely in the loop, so that the wearer can loosen or tighten it when he puts it on his arm.&quot;, &quot;14. The thongs of the phylacteries, whether for the head or for the arm, must have their exterior surface black. This is a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. But the other side of the thongs, being close to the skin, are fit for use if they are green or white. They must not however be red, for if the thong were inadvertently turned, the color of its lower surface would subject the wearer to ignominy. The lower side of the thongs should not be otherwise in color than the base of the leather case containing the parchment slips. If the latter is green, the former should be green; if white, the former should be white. It is comely if the phylacteries are wholly black, namely, both the case containing the slips of parchment and the thongs.&quot;, &quot;15. The leather which forms the receptacles of the phylacteries and its thongs is to be made from the hide of a domestic or wild quadruped or skin of a fowl that belongs to the clean species, and may even be taken from those of these species that are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Terefah.&lt;/i&gt; If they were made of the skin or hide of unclean species, or if the phylacteries were covered with gold, the phylacteries are unfit for use. The leather for the thongs must be expressly tanned for their intended purpose to be thongs of phylacteries. The leather which forms the receptacles for the phylacteries need not be tanned. Even if it consists of raw hide it is fit for use. Many places have the custom to make them of raw hide.&quot;, &quot;16. The receptacles of the phylacteries may not be prepared by any one but an Israelite; for the making of these is like the writing of the prescribed sections because of the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; which is embossed on the phylactery for the head, as we have already stated. Hence, if a non-Israelite made or sewed the phylacteries, they are unfit for use. So too, whoever is disqualified from writing the prescribed sections for the phylacteries may not prepare them.&quot;, &quot;17. The phylactery for the head may not be transformed into a phylactery for the arm, but the latter may be changed into the former; on the principle that an object may not be degraded from a higher to a lower sacred use. So too, the thong of the phylactery for the head may not be transferred to a phylactery for the arm. This rule only applies to phylacteries that had been worn. But with regard to phylacteries for the head that no one had ever worn, if it is desired to transform them into phylacteries for the arm, this may be done. How is this effected? It is covered with leather so that it appears as one receptacle. The phylactery may then be bound on the arm.&quot;, &quot;18. In case the stitches of the phylacteries are broken, they become unfit for use if there are two broken stitches adjacent to each other, or three not adjacent. This rule applies to old phylacteries. New phylacteries are fit for use as long as they keep their surface unimpaired. The following would be called new. If, at the place where the stitches have given way, part of the leather is held in the hand so that the phylactery is suspended, and the leather is strong enough not to be further torn, such phylacteries would be regarded as new. If however the leather is not strong enough to bear the weight of the phylacteries so suspended, but would tear, such phylacteries are regarded as old.&quot;, &quot;19. A thong that has become broken is not to be tied together nor sewn up; but it is to be removed, put away, and replaced by a new thong. The parts of the broken thong are unfit for use unless the length and breadth of the part is of the prescribed dimension or larger. Care should always be taken that the external surface of the thongs should be above, when the phylacteries are bound on the hand or round the head. End of the chapter.&quot;], [&quot;1. Where is the phylactery of the head placed? It is placed on that part of the crown of the head, where the hair adjacent to the forehead ends, and this is the place where an infant\&#39;s brain pulsates (the fontanelle). The phylactery needs to be adjusted so that it lies in the centre of the forehead, in a line with the point between the eyes. The knot should be at the top of the back of the neck, which is the end of the skull.&quot;, &quot;2. The phylactery of the hand is bound on the left arm over the biceps muscle which is the flesh that stands out on the upper arm that is intermediate between the shoulder-blade and forearm, so that when the upper arm is held close to the ribs, the phylactery will be opposite the heart and thus the precept will be fulfilled, \\&quot;And these words \\u2026 shall be upon thine heart\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:6).&quot;, &quot;3. To lay the phylactery of the hand on the palm or that of the head on the forehead is the practice of the Sadducees. He who makes the phylactery round like a nut is not fulfilling the precept in any way. A left-handed person lays the phylactery on his right arm, used by him as his left. If one is ambidextrous, he lays it on his left arm, which is the same as the left arm of any other person. The places where the phylacteries are respectively bound and laid are known by tradition.&quot;, &quot;4. The lack of a phylactery for the head does not preclude one from putting on that of the hand, nor does the lack of a phylactery of the hand preclude one from putting on that for the head. Each is a duty separate and independent. What blessings are recited? For the phylactery of the head, the formula is as follows: \\&quot;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and given us a command concerning the precept of phylacteries\\&quot;. For that of the hand, the form is as follows: \\&quot;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to lay the phylacteries\\&quot;.&quot;, &quot;5. This rule applies to the case where a person puts on one phylactery only. But when one lays both phylacteries, he recites one blessing, namely, the form, \\&quot;And hast commanded us to lay the phylacteries\\&quot;, binds the phylactery on his arm, and then puts on that for the head. When they are removed, that on the head is removed first, and afterwards that on the arm.&quot;, &quot;6. When a person has recited the blessing, \\&quot;Who hast commanded us to lay phylacteries\\&quot;, and bound the phylactery on his arm, he is forbidden to converse, even to the extent of acknowledging his master\&#39;s greeting, till he has put on the phylactery of the head. If he conversed he has committed a transgression; and when putting on the phylactery for the head, he must recite another blessing, viz: the form, \\&quot;Who hast given us a command concerning the precept of the phylacteries\\&quot;, and then he puts on the phylactery for the head.&quot;, &quot;7. On each occasion when one puts on phylacteries, the blessing is recited, even if they are removed and put on again several times in the day. It is a universal rule with regard to religious precepts that the appropriate blessings are recited prior to their performance. Hence too, the blessing for the phylactery of the hand has to be recited after it is placed on the biceps muscle before the thong is tightened, for the fastening constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.&quot;, &quot;8. When a person removes his phylacteries, and puts them in a bag, he should not place the phylactery of the hand beneath and that for the head above it, because when he will again have occasion to put them on, he will come into contact with the phylactery of the head first, will thus be under the necessity of putting it down and take out the phylactery of the hand, the former not being put on before the latter. It is forbidden to leave a precept and pass on to the fulfillment of another religious duty, the rule being that the duty that first presents itself should first engage our attention. Hence, the phylactery for the hand should be placed above so that one may come into contact with it first, and the phylacteries be put on in the right order.&quot;, &quot;9. A bag expressly intended to contain phylacteries and into which these have been placed, becomes consecrated and may not be put to secular use. If the bag was intended for this express purpose of containing phylacteries but had never contained them, or if phylacteries had been casually placed in a bag not set aside for that use, it does not become sacred, and continues to be a secular object as it had been hitherto. Phylacteries may not be suspended by their thong or by the part which contains the scriptural section. But the bag containing the phylacteries may be suspended.&quot;, &quot;10. The proper time for putting on phylacteries is when it is day and not when it is night, for it is said, \\&quot;Day by day\\&quot;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Usually rendered, \\u201cfrom year to year\\u201d, referring to observance of the feast of Passover.&lt;/i&gt; (Exodus 13:10). \\&quot;The ordinance\\&quot; mentioned in this verse refers to the precept of phylacteries. So it is said, \\&quot;And it shall be for a sign\\&quot;, while Sabbaths and festivals are them-also, Sabbaths and festivals are not seasons for putting on phylacteries, for selves a sign. When is the proper time in the day to put on phylacteries? At the hour when a person can see his neighbour at a distance of four cubits and recognize him. The period extends till sunset.&quot;, &quot;11. A person who put on phylacteries before sunset, is permitted when it becomes dusk, to continue to wear them, even throughout the night. The multitude however is not to be so taught. Everyone should be instructed not to wear phylacteries at night, but to remove them at sunset. Whoever deliberately puts on phylacteries after sunset, violates a prohibition, for it is said, \\&quot;And thou shalt keep this ordinance in its season, day by day\\&quot; (Exodus 13:10).&quot;, &quot;12. If the sun sets while a man with the phylacteries on his head was on the road, he places his hand upon the phylactery till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If Sabbath or a festival arrived while he was sitting in the house of study, with the phylactery on his head, he places his hand upon it till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If there is a house near the City Wall,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*the house of study was outside the town.&lt;/i&gt; where the phylacteries could be safely left, he should leave them there. If he did not remove them after sunset, because he had no place where they would be safe, and he kept them on for the sake of security, his conduct is lawful.&quot;, &quot;13. One who is exempt from reading the &lt;i&gt;Shema&lt;/i&gt; is exempt from putting on phylacteries. If a child less than thirteen years of age knows how to take care of his phylacteries, his father purchases a set for him, so as to train him in the practice of religious precepts. Those who suffer intestinal troubles or have difficulty in controlling their sphincters are exempt from the obligation of putting on phylacteries. All who are ritually unclean are under the same obligation of putting on phylacteries as those who are ritually clean. One, who is in pain or whose mind is not calm and composed is exempt from the duty of putting on phylacteries; for the wearer must not allow his consciousness of them to wander. Priests while engaged in the temple service, Levites during the recital of hymns in their appointed places, Israelites while they are in the Sanctuary, are exempt from the duties of reciting the prayers and putting on phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;14. As long as one is wearing phylacteries, he should frequently touch them with his fingers, so as not to lose consciousness of them for a single moment. For their degree of sanctity is higher than that of the golden plate which the High Priest wore on his forehead. On the latter, the name of God was engraved once only, while the phylactery for the head contains the tetragrammaton twenty-one times, and the phylactery for the arm, an equal number of times.&quot;, &quot;15. A requisite in wearing phylacteries is physical cleanliness. One should take care that no flatus escapes him while he has them on. Hence, he may not, while wearing them, indulge in regular sleep or even doze. But if they are covered with a cloth, he may doze, even while wearing them. How so? He places his head between his knees and dozes in a sitting posture. If his phylacteries were folded and held in his hand, the holder may even sleep in the regular way.&quot;, &quot;16. No meal, unless it be of a casual character, may be eaten, while one wears phylacteries (without previous preparation). Before proceeding to a regular meal, he removes them, places them on the table, washes his hands, puts them on again, recites the blessing for food while he has them on.&quot;, &quot;17. If one feels a call of nature while wearing phylacteries, he is not to deposit them, before entering the lavatory, in the crevices that open towards the public thoroughfare, lest passers-by may take them. How should he act? Even if he needs to relieve the bladder while he is at a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, he should remove the phylacteries, roll them up in his garment, as a scroll is rolled up, grasp them in his right hand opposite his heart, taking care that not a thong projects outside his hand as much as a hand breadth; then he enters, relieves himself, and, after having left, goes away to a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, and puts on his phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;18. This rule only applies to the case of a permanent lavatory. But one may not enter an extemporized lavatory with phylacteries even rolled up. They should be removed and given to another person for safe keeping.&quot;, &quot;19. If one wearing phylacteries needed to go to the lavatory at eventide when there would be no more time to put them on again, he should not enter with the phylacteries rolled up in his garment, even to relieve his bladder, if the lavatory is a permanent one. How should he act? He should remove the phylacteries, place them in their bag which must be at least a hand breadth long, or even in a smaller bag provided it is not specially assigned as a receptable for phylacteries. This he keeps in his hand and enters. Thus, too, at night time, if he needs to visit the lavatory, he may put the phylacteries in a bag which he keeps in his hand when entering.&quot;, &quot;20. Translation omitted.&quot;, &quot;21. Translation omitted.&quot;, &quot;22. One is permitted to put on phylacteries in that portion of a bathhouse where all are attired. In that portion where some are in their attire while others are nude, the phylacteries which one wears need not be removed, but they may not be put on. Where all are nude, the phylacteries must be removed, and needless to add, they may not be put on.&quot;, &quot;23. A person should not walk in a cemetery with phylacteries on his head. When he is within a distance of four cubits from a corpse or a grave, the phylacteries are to be removed till he has passed on to a distance outside four cubits. Phylacteries must not be put on before one is decently covered and has put on his garments. If a person is carrying a burden on his head, he must remove the phylactery from his head, and may not put it on till he has removed the burden. Even a kerchief [alone] may not be put upon the head when one is wearing phylacteries. But he puts his cap over the phylactery.&quot;, &quot;24. In a room where there are phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, marital intercourse may not take place, till these have been taken out, or placed in a receptacle which itself is enclosed in another receptacle not assigned to the use of phylacteries or a scroll of the Law. If the latter receptacle has been so assigned, and even if there be ten such receptacles, they are all regarded as one receptacle. If he placed the sacred articles in two receptacles, one within the other, they may be put for security under his pillow between the bolster and the coverlid\\u2014not however exactly beneath his head. This may be done even if his wife shares his couch.&quot;, &quot;25. The sanctity of phylacteries is a high degree of sanctity. As long as phylacteries are on a man\&#39;s head and arm, he is humble and God-fearing, is not drawn into frivolity and idle talk, does not dwell on evil thoughts but occupies his mind with thoughts of truth and righteousness. A man should therefore endeavour to wear phylacteries the whole day, this being the right way of fulfilling the precept. It is said of &lt;i&gt;Rav,&lt;/i&gt; the disciple of our Sainted Teacher (R. Judah, the Prince), that throughout his life no one saw him, without Torah, Tzitzis (fringes on his garments) or phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;26. Although the proper mode of fulfilling the precept is to wear phylacteries the whole day, it is especially a duty to do so during the recital of prayers. The sages say, \\&quot;Whoever reads the &lt;i&gt;Shema&lt;/i&gt; without wearing phylacteries is regarded as testifying falsely in his own person.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*He recites the Commandment to wear &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and does not fulfill it.&lt;/i&gt; Whoever does not wear phylacteries at all violates eight affirmative precepts, since in each of the four sections, the command is set forth to lay phylacteries on the head and on the arm. Whoever wears phylacteries regularly will be blessed with longevity, as it is said, \&#39;The Lord is upon them: they shall live\&#39;\\&quot; (Isaiah 38:16).&quot;], [&quot;1. How is the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**Sections of Scripture placed on doorposts.&lt;/i&gt; written? Two sections of the Pentateuch, those beginning, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4) and, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) are written in a single column on one slip of parchment. A space of half a nail\&#39;s breadth is left as a margin above and below the column. If the Pentateuchal sections were written in two or three columns, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use. They must not however be written in the shape of a tail (broad at the top line and gradually narrowing to a point), or of a circle, or of a tent (narrow at the top and broadening to the base). A &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; written in any of these forms is unfit for use. If the text was written out of order, for example, if the second section was in front of the first, it is unfit for use. If it was written on two slips of parchment, even though these were sewn together, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use. A Scroll of the Law that has become worn out or phylacteries that are worn out may not be used for a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Nor may margins cut off from a scroll of the Law be so used; for anything dedicated to a sacred purpose may not be degraded from a higher to a lower degree of sacredness.&quot;, &quot;2. It is a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (an act of piety) to separate the section beginning, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; from that beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass\\&quot; by a \\&quot;closed\\&quot; space (blank of nine letters). If the division between the two sections was an \\&quot;open\\&quot; one (the second section beginning a new line), the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use, as, in the Pentateuch, the second section does not immediately follow the first. Special heed should be paid to the tittles in the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; The following are the tittles which are made in the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;3. In the first section, there are seven letters, each of which should have above it three upright lines in the shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Zain.&lt;/i&gt; They are the &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ayin&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Shema; Nun&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nafshecha;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Totafoth.&lt;/i&gt; The second section has six letters, each of which should have above it three &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. They are the &lt;i&gt;Gimel&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Degancha;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Totafoth;&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;Tzadi&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Ha-aretz.&lt;/i&gt; If the tittles were omitted or if they are more or less than those specified, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; has not been rendered unfit for use. But if it was written without the lines having been ruled, or if the scribe paid no heed to &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; letters, or if he added in the text even a single letter, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;4. It is a universal custom to write the word &lt;i&gt;Shaddai&lt;/i&gt; (Almighty) on the other side of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; opposite the blank space between the two sections. As this word is written on the outside, the practice is unobjectionable. They, however, who write names of angels, holy names, a Biblical text or inscriptions usual on seals, within the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; are among those who have no portion in the world to come. For these fools not only fail to fulfill the commandment but they treat an important precept that expresses the Unity of God, the love of Him, and His worship, as if it were an amulet to promote their own personal interests; for, according to their foolish minds, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is something that will secure for them advantage in the vanities of the world.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*A reproof to those who sell Mezuzoth to be worn as amulets !&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;5. It is a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (act of piety) to write &lt;i&gt;Al Ha-aretz&lt;/i&gt; (the last two words) on the last line, either at the beginning or in the middle of the line. All the scribes follow the custom of writing the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; in twenty-two lines, and (the last two words) &lt;i&gt;Al Ha-aretz&lt;/i&gt; at the commencement of the last line. The following are the words in order, which begin each of the lines: (See the Hebrew text on the corresponding right-hand side, page 127b.)&quot;, &quot;6. When the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is folded, it is rolled up from the end of the line to the beginning, so that anyone opening it is able to read it from the beginning to the end of the line. After it has been rolled up, it is placed in a cylinder of reed, wood or other material, which is attached to the doorpost with a nail; or else a cavity is hollowed out in the doorpost, into which the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is inserted.&quot;, &quot;7. Before one affixes it to the doorpost, he recites the blessing, \\&quot;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us to affix the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah\\&quot;.&lt;/i&gt; No blessing is recited at the time when it is written, because the affixing of it constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.&quot;, &quot;8. If one suspended it on a staff, it is unfit, for this is not affixing it (to the doorpost). If one placed it behind the door, he has not fulfilled the precept. If he perforated the door and forced the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; into it like a nail, as a bolt is inserted in the staple-ring, it is unfit. If it was placed in a hollow of the doorpost at a depth of a hand-breadth, it is unfit. If one cut a stick, put a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on it, attached this stick to other sticks and made of them all a doorpost, it is unfit, because the affixing of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; preceded the erection of the doorpost.&quot;, &quot;9. The &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; of a private dwelling is examined once every seven years; that attached to a public building twice in the Jubilee (fifty years). The object is to ascertain whether a letter has been torn away or obliterated; because owing to the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; being affixed to walls, it is liable to decay.&quot;, &quot;10. The fulfillment of the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is incumbent upon all Israelites, including women and slaves (of Israelites). Children under the age of thirteen years are trained to affix the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; to their rooms. One who rents a dwelling outside the Holy Land, or lodges at an inn in the Holy Land is exempt from the obligation of affixing a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; for a period of thirty days after beginning his occupancy. But if one rents a home in the Holy Land, the duty of affixing a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; devolves immediately.&quot;, &quot;11. If one lets a dwelling to another person, the duty devolves upon the lessee to bring a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; and attach it, even if he has to pay for doing so, for the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is the personal obligation of the occupant and not an obligation attaching to the structure. When he surrenders possession, he must not, on quitting the premises, remove the Mezuzah. But if the owner is a non-Israelite, the Jewish tenant, when leaving, takes it away.&quot;], [&quot;1. There are ten conditions which must exist in a dwelling, to put the occupant under an obligation to affix a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If one of these is absent, he is exempt. These are as follows: The dwelling must have a superficial area of four cubits by four cubits or more; it must have two door-posts, a lintel, a roof and doors; the entrance should be ten hand-breadths high or more; it must be a secular (not a sacred) structure; it must have been erected for human occupancy, for honored use (not a lavatory), and built for permanent habitation.&quot;, &quot;2. A dwelling, the superficial area of which is less than four cubits by four cubits does not require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If its area is equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits, even if it is circular in shape or has five angles, or, needless to add, if its length is greater than its breadth, it requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; provided that it covers an area equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits.&quot;, &quot;3. A porch, that is a place with three walls and a roof, even though it has two uprights on the fourth side does not need a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; the uprights serving to support the roof and not as doorposts. Thus too, a roof without walls that rests on pillars on either side, even if it presents the appearance of a dwelling is exempt from the obligation of having a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; on account of its having no doorposts\\u2014the pillars having been erected to support the roof.&quot;, &quot;4. A dwelling with posts on either side (of the door), and in the place of the lintel an arch in the shape of a bow, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; provided that the posts are ten hand-breadths high or more. If they are not ten hand-breadths high, there is no such obligation, as the dwelling has no lintel.&quot;, &quot;5. A dwelling without a roof does not require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Where part of it is covered with a roof and part uncovered, it seems to me that if the portion over the entrance is roofed, the structure requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; After the doors are set up, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is affixed.&quot;, &quot;6. The Temple Mount, its chambers and courts, synagogues and houses of study which have no residences are exempt, because they are sacred. A village synagogue in which transients lodge requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; So too, a city synagogue which has a dwelling house attached to it, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; None of the Temple entrances had a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; except the Gate of Nikanor, and the gate within that gate, and the entrance to the Chamber of Parhedrin, because this chamber was the High Priest\&#39;s residence during his seven days of seclusion (prior to the Day of Atonement).&quot;, &quot;7. A hayloft, a cattle-shed, a wood store and a barn are exempted from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because of the phrase, \\&quot;thy house\\&quot; (in the text \\&quot;thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house\\&quot;), which means a dwelling assigned to thy use and excludes the aforementioned and similar classes of buildings. Hence, a cattle-shed, where women stay adorning themselves, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because it also serves as a human habitation. A lodge or porch\\u2014either rectangular or circular\\u2014leading to a garden, a garden and a sheepfold are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because they are not constructed to serve as residences. If dwellings requiring a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; open to these places, the latter must also have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;8. Hence, entrances, whether leading to courtyards or to passages, and gates of districts or cities, must each have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because dwellings which require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; open on to them. Even where ten rooms open one to the other, each requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; just as the innermost room requires it. This is the reason for the rule that a gate opening from the garden to a courtyard requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;9. A privy, bath-house, ritual bath-house, tannery and similar places are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; because they are not erected to serve as dwellings for honored use. The tabernacle for the feast of Tabernacles, and a room in a ship are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; because they are not made for permanent occupancy. Of two potter\&#39;s booths, one leading to the other, the exterior is exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because it is not permanent. Shops in market places are exempt, because they are not intended to be used as residences.&quot;, &quot;10. A dwelling with several doors, although only one is regularly used for coming in and going out, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; affixed to each door. A small door between a dwelling (below) and the attic needs a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Every room in a dwelling, even a room within a room, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; at the entrance of the inner chamber, of the outer chamber and of the house, for they all serve the purpose of residence and are permanent.&quot;, &quot;11. A door between a house of study or synagogue and a private house, if used habitually for entering and leaving, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If a door is between two dwellings, the position of the hinge determines the side on which the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is to be fixed. The side on which the hinge is visible is regarded as the dwelling in reference to which the position of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is decided.&quot;, &quot;12. Where is the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; to be fixed? Within the width of the doorpost, a hand-breadth from the external edge at a height of a third of the elevation of the entrance, counting from the top. If placed higher it is fit in position, provided that it is a hand-breadth lower than the lintel. It should be fixed on the right side of one entering; if placed on the left side, it is unfit for use. A house owned by partners requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;13. A person should pay heed to the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah;&lt;/i&gt; for it is an obligation perpetually binding upon all. Whenever one enters or leaves a home with the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on the doorpost, he will be confronted with the Declaration of God\&#39;s Unity, blessed be His holy name; and will remember the love due to God, and will be aroused from his slumbers and his foolish absorption in temporal vanities. He will realize that nothing endures to all eternity save knowledge of the Ruler of the Universe. This thought will immediately restore him to his right senses and he will walk in the paths of righteousness. Our ancient teachers said: He who has phylacteries on his head and arm, fringes on his garment and a Mezuzah on his door may be presumed not to sin, for he has many monitors\\u2014angels that save him from sinning, as it is said, (Psalms 34:8) \\&quot;The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them\\&quot;.&quot;], [&quot;1. It is an affirmative precept binding upon every individual Israelite to write a scroll of the Law for his own use, as it is said, \\&quot;Now therefore write ye this Song for you\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:19). As the Torah is not written in separate sections, this text means, \\&quot;Write for yourselves the Torah in which this Song is contained.\\&quot; Even if one\&#39;s ancestors have left a person a scroll, it is a religious duty to write a scroll at his own expense. If he wrote it with his own hand, it is accounted to him as if he had received it from Sinai. If one does not know how to write a scroll, he should get others to write it for him. He who corrects a scroll, even a single letter of it, is regarded as if he had written it completely.&quot;, &quot;2. A king has the duty of writing for himself another scroll of the Law, in his capacity as sovereign, in addition to the scroll which he owns in his private capacity, as it is said, \\&quot;And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law, etc.\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:18). This copy is corrected by comparison with a scroll kept in the temple court, and under the authority of the Supreme Judicature. The scroll which the king had possessed when he was a private individual, he places in his archives. The one that he wrote or had written for him when he became king, should always be with him. If he goes to war, the scroll is to be with him. When he enters his home, it is to be with him. When he hears a cause (tries a case) it is to be with him. When he sits down to a meal, it is to be placed before him, as it is said, \\&quot;And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:19).&quot;, &quot;3. If he possessed no scroll before he came to the throne, he has to write, after his accession, two scrolls of the law, one of which he places in his archives, while the other is to be always with him. It must never be away from him, except at night, or when he goes to the bath or the lavatory or lies down on his couch to sleep.&quot;, &quot;4. A scroll of the Law that has been written without having been ruled, or that has been written partly on parchment made of whole hide and partly on that made of the inner half of split hide is unfit for use. It must be entirely written either on the former or on the latter. How is a scroll of the law to be written? The scribe is to use the correct script and it should also be exceedingly fine. Between one word and another, he is to leave the space of a small letter; between one letter and another (in the same word) the space of a hair\&#39;s breadth; between one line and the next the space of a line. The length of each line is to be thirty letters, wide enough to write the word Le-Mi-Sh-Pe-Ch-O-S-E-Che-M&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Ten consonant letters printed here in capital letters. See also below.&lt;/i&gt; three times. This is to be the width of each column. No line shall be shorter, so that the column shall not look like an epistle. Nor should any line be wider so that the reader\&#39;s eyes should not have to wander across the sheet.&quot;, &quot;5. He should not diminish the size of the characters in order to leave a space between one paragraph and another. When he comes (at the end of a line) to a word of five letters, he must not write two within the column and three outside the column; but he is to write three letters within the column and two outside the column. If there is not enough space left at the end of the line to write three letters, he is to leave it blank and begin at the commencement of the next line.&quot;, &quot;6. If at the end of a line, he has a word of two letters to write, he may not place it between the columns (that is, outside the column) but he writes it at the beginning of the next line. If, before the line is filled up, he has a word of ten letters, more or less, to write and there is not enough space left on the line to write it all within the column, if he is able to write half the word within the column and half outside the column, he may do so. If he cannot do this, he leaves the space blank and writes the word at the beginning of the next line.&quot;, &quot;7. Between each book and the next, he leaves a space of four lines, no more and no less, blank without any writing, and starts the next book at the beginning of the fifth line. When completing the Torah, he is to finish it in the middle of the line at the end of the column. If several lines of the column would be left, he shortens the lines, so as to begin at the beginning of the last line of the column and not complete it, and also so plans the lines that the final words &lt;i&gt;Le-\\u00e9n\\u00e9 Chol Yisrael&lt;/i&gt; (\\&quot;in the sight of all Israel\\&quot;) shall be in the middle of the line at the end of the column.&quot;, &quot;8. He should pay careful attention to the letters that are written large or small, to the letters that are punctuated with dots above them, to the letters that are written differently to the others, such as the letter P\\u00e9 and the letters that are curved, in the way the scribes have carried on the tradition. He is to pay attention to the tittles&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*lines over each of the letters &lt;i&gt;Shin, Ayin, Teth, Nuen, Zayin, Gimel, Tzadi&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; and the number of them in each case\\u2014one letter having above it a single tittle, another having seven tittles. All the tittles have the shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; and are to be thin as a hair.&quot;, &quot;9. All these provisoes are only stated in order that the duty of writing a scroll shall be observed in the most perfect way. If, however the scribe made changes in the method here set forth, was not careful in regard to the tittles, writing however all the letters correctly, or if he wrote the lines close together or far apart, extended the lines or shortened them\\u2014since he did not join any letter to another, omit aught or add aught, mar the form of any letter, nor make any variation in regard to which paragraphs should be open and which closed, the scroll is fit for use.&quot;, &quot;10. There are other rules mentioned in the Talmud which the scribes observe as a tradition handed down from one to another. They are as follows: The number of lines in each column shall not be less than forty-eight and not more than sixty; the blank spaces between one section and another shall be such that nine letters, e.g., A She R, A She R, A She R, can be written in it. The five lines preceding the Song at the Red Sea (Exodus 14:28, 29, 30, 30, 31) shall begin respectively with the words &lt;i&gt;Habaim, Bayabashah, Hashem, Mes, Bemitzraim.&lt;/i&gt; The five lines after it shall begin respectively with the words &lt;i&gt;Vatikach, Achareha, Sus, Vayetz\\u00eb\\u00fc, Vayav\\u00f6\\u00fc&lt;/i&gt; (Exodus 15:20, 20, 21, 22, 23). The six lines before the Song of Moses beginning &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) shall respectively commence with the words &lt;i&gt;Veaeedah, Achar\\u00e9, Haderech, Beacharith, Lehacheeso, Kehal&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 31:28, 29, 29, 29, 29, 30); and the five lines after the Song of Moses shall begin with the words &lt;i&gt;Vayabo, Ledabber, Asher, Hazoth, Asher&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:44, 45, 46, 46, 47). All these points of observance are to enable us to fulfill the duty in the best way. Variations in these particulars do not render the scroll unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;11. But if the scribe wrote &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; a word that should be &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or vice versa; or a word traditionally pronounced differently to the way it is written, according to the traditional pronunciation, for example, if he wrote &lt;i&gt;Yishkevenoh&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Yishgelenoh,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Oovatechorim&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Oova-apolim,&lt;/i&gt; etc.; or if he wrote an \\&quot;open\\&quot; section as if it were a closed section or vice versa; or if he wrote one of the Songs like the ordinary prose text, or an ordinary section in the form of one of the Songs, the scroll is unfit for use as a scroll of the Law. It has not the sacredness of a scroll of the Law, but is like any one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught.&quot;, &quot;12. A scroll of the Law, which has not been examined for correctness may not be kept longer than thirty days. It must either be corrected or segregated.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*put away and not be used.&lt;/i&gt; A scroll of the Law which has three errors in each column should be corrected. If there are four, it must be put away. If the greater portion has been found to be correct, and the remainder has four errors in each column, but there is even one column in this erroneous portion with less than four errors, corrections could be made.&quot;, &quot;13. This rule only applies to cases where the scribe wrote &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; words that should be written &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; so that he would be under the necessity of inserting the letters that he forgot between the lines. But if he wrote &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; words that are &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; even if every column contains several errors, he corrects them, as he only erases and does not have to insert letters between the lines.&quot;, &quot;14. It is permitted to write the Pentateuch, each book in a separate scroll. These scrolls have not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law that is complete. One may not however write a scroll containing some sections. Such a scroll may not be written for a child\&#39;s instruction. This is permitted, however, where there is the intention to complete the remainder of the book. If one wrote such a scroll with three words on each line, this is permitted.&quot;, &quot;15. The Pentateuch, the Prophets and the Hagiography may be put together in one volume. In such a case, a space of four lines is left blank between each book of the Pentateuch and the next; a space of three lines between each of the major Prophets and the next; and a space of three lines between each of the twelve minor prophets and the next, so that he can, if he wishes, separate any book. The order of the prophetical books is as follows: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah, the Twelve Minor Prophets. The order of the books of the Hagiography is: Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel, Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.&quot;, &quot;16. None of The Holy Scriptures may be written except on ruled lines, even if they are written on paper: Three words of Scripture may be written without ruling the line, but to write more is forbidden. A volume containing the Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiography has not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, but of a single book of the Pentateuch. The scroll which contains more than the entire Pentateuch is in the same class as that which contains less than the entire Pentateuch, on the principle that excess is similar to deficiency.&quot;], [&quot;1. The &lt;i&gt;open&lt;/i&gt; section has two forms. If the previous section ended in the middle of a line, the scribe leaves the remainder of the line blank and commences the open section at the beginning of the next line. This only applies to the case where, after the conclusion of the previous section, there is left sufficient space on the line to write nine letters. But if the space left is less, or if the previous section was completed at the end of the line, the next line must be left blank, and the open section is begun at the commencement of the third line.&quot;, &quot;2. A &lt;i&gt;closed&lt;/i&gt; section has three forms. If the previous section ended within the line, the scribe leaves a blank space for the required dimension (enough to write nine letters) and begins the closed section at the end of the line, provided that there is a blank space between it and the preceding section. If the completion of the previous section did not leave space for the blank of the required breadth and for writing (at least) one word at the end of the line, the scribe should leave the remainder of the line blank, leave a little space at the beginning of the next line blank, and begin the closed section within the line. If the previous section ended at the close of the line, he leaves a blank space of the required breadth (nine letters), at the beginning of the next line, and begins to write the closed section within the line. Hence, you may say that an open section always begins within the line.&quot;, &quot;3. A scroll which is inaccurate in regard to words that are written &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; can be made good by being corrected, as already explained. But if the scribe made a mistake in the spacing between the sections, and wrote an open section as if it were a closed section, or a closed section as if it were an open section or left a space where a section does not end, or continued writing without leaving a space where a section ends, or deviated from the form in which the Songs are written, in all these cases, the Scroll is unfit for use and there is no remedy except to remove the entire column in which the mistake occurs.&quot;, &quot;4. As in all the scrolls I have seen, I noticed serious incorrectness in these regards, while authorities on the Massorah, who write treatises and compilations with the aim of pointing out the sections that are closed and those that are open, differ according to the variations in the scrolls on which they rely, I deemed it fit to write here a list of the sections which are closed and those which are open, as also the forms in which the Songs of the Pentateuch are written so that all the scrolls may be corrected from, and compared with them. The copy on which I relied is the well-known Egyptian codex which contains the twenty-four books of the Scriptures and which had been in Jerusalem for several years\\u2014used as the standard text for the examination of scrolls. Everyone relied upon it because it had been examined by Ben Asher who closely studied it for many years and examined it again whenever it was being copied. This codex was the text on which I relied in the scroll of the Law that I wrote according to the rules.&quot;, &quot;(Here follow lists of open and closed sections which are in the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 131b to 136b.)&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF GENESIS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 43; of closed sections 48; total 91.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF EXODUS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 69; of closed sections, 95; total 164.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 52; of closed sections, 46; total 98.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF NUMBERS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 92; of closed sections, 66; total 158.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections of this book is 34; of closed sections, 124, total 158. The number of open sections in the entire Pentateuch is 290; of the closed sections, 379; total 669.&quot;, &quot;The form of the Song &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43). Every line has a blank space in the middle, like that preceding a closed section. Hence, every line is divided into two parts. The song is written in 70 lines. The words at the beginning of the lines are as follows:&quot;, &quot;(See the Hebrew text on the right hand side page 136a)&quot;, &quot;All these are the words at the beginning of the lines. And the following are the words at the beginning of the latter half of the line which are in the middle of the column.&quot;, &quot;(See the Hebrew text on the right hand pages 136a and 136b)&quot;, &quot;The Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15:1-19) is written in thirty lines, the first line in the ordinary way; the other lines, one with a blank space in the middle, the next with blank spaces in two places, so that the line is divided into three parts and so a blank space corresponds to writing (above and below it) and vice versa as follows.&quot;, &quot;See the Hebrew text on the right-hand side 136a, 136b and 137a as it should be written in the scroll. The English pages should be blank.&quot;, &quot;Throughout the Torah, in the Songs as well as in the rest of the text, the scribe should aim to write all the letters of each word close together, taking care that no letter should be joined to another, and that no letter should be so far away from the next as to make the word seem two words. The interval between the letters in one word should be a hairbreadth. If the scribe wrote one letter so far apart from the other that it would appear to a child who is not familiar with the text like two words, the scroll is unfit for use till he makes the correction.&quot;], [&quot;1. The length of a scroll of the Law should not exceed the circumference, nor should the circumference exceed the length. What is a suitable length? Where parchment of a whole hide is used, six hand-breadths, that is twenty-four finger-breadths taking the thumb as the standard. Where the parchment of the external half of the hide is used, the length may be more or less than this dimension, provided only that the length is equal to the circumference. So also in the case of parchment of a whole hide, if the scribe made the length less than six hand-breadths and wrote in a small hand or longer than six handbreadths and spread out the writing so that the length of the column is equal to the circumference\\u2014this too is correct.&quot;, &quot;2. The extent of the lower margin is four finger-breadths; of the upper margin, three finger-breadths; between one column and another, two finger-breadths. Hence, on the right and left of every sheet of parchment, the scribe has to leave a margin a finger-breadth wide and enough beside for sewing; so that, when the sheets are sewn together, there will be throughout the scroll a blank space of two finger-breadths between the columns. The scribe must leave in addition enough margin at the beginning and end of the scroll to fold a blank column round the rollers. All these dimensions are to be observed in order to fulfill the precept properly. But if the scribe exceeded or fell short of them, he does not render the scroll unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;3. How shall one proceed so that the length of the scroll shall turn out equal to its circumference. The parchment sheets are made evenly rectangular; each sheet being six handbreadths wide, all of the same dimensions. They are rolled evenly into one bundle tightly rolled up. And skins are added and tightly rolled till the circumference is six handbreadths, which is the width of the sheets. This is measured with a thread of wool which is placed round the bundle.&quot;, &quot;4. The scribe then fashions a straight ruler, forty or fifty finger-breadths long; one of these finger-breadths, he marks in two, three and four equal parts so as to be able to measure off a half, a third and a quarter of a finger-breadth and similar fractions. With this, he measures each sheet, so as to ascertain the number of finger-breadths it contains and so determine how many finger-breadths there are in the entire bundle.&quot;, &quot;5. He then takes two or three other sheets of parchment, to test the size of the characters, and writes on them one column. The length of a column of writing is obviously seventeen finger-breadths as a margin must be left, of three finger-breadths above and four finger-breadths below. The width of the column will depend on the handwriting, whether it is large or small. So also, the number of lines will vary according to the handwriting, as between each line and the next, the space of a line must be left.&quot;, &quot;6. Having written the column which he uses as a test as he pleases, he measures its breadth by means of the finger-breadths of the ruler, and adds two finger-breadths for the margin between column and column. He then calculates how many columns of such writing would fill the sheets in the bundle he had made up. Having ascertained the total number of columns, he will then see how much of the entire Pentateuch is in the column which he wrote as a test. He will make the estimate with the aid of the scroll which serves him as a copy, and calculate accordingly. If the number of columns of the kind of writing which he wrote is sufficient for the whole Torah\\u2014well and good. If the calculation showed that there are more columns than are required for the whole Torah, he will enlarge the writing, so as to diminish the number of columns, and he will make a test with another column. If the calculation shows that for the writing of the Torah more columns will be required than are contained in his sheets, he will use smaller characters and so secure a larger number of columns. He will make the test with column after column till the calculation comes out exact.&quot;, &quot;7. Once he knows the width of the column and the size of the characters, he can begin writing the scroll with that bundle of sheets. He then divides the parchment (sheets) into columns by ruling them off,\\u2014each column of the same width as that which his tests and calculations showed to be the right size. If three or four finger-breadths are left over beyond the last column, he should leave one finger-breadth and enough besides for sewing the sheet to the next, and cut off the rest, and need feel no apprehension, for at the end, more sheets will be added to make up for the superfluous strips that he cut off from each sheet. Nor need he make any calculations in regard to this, for the writing will be according to the number of columns.&quot;, &quot;8. So too, if one wishes to make the width of the scroll more or less than six handbreadths, he makes his calculation in the same way; and the length will be exactly equal to the circumference neither more nor less, provided that no mistake has been made in the calculation.&quot;, &quot;9. The finger-breadth in all the dimensions here and in the rest of the Torah is that of the medium sized finger. On careful examination, we find it to be the breadth of seven medium sized barley corns placed close together, this being equal to the length of two barley corns measured liberally. The handbreadth, wherever mentioned, is equal to four such finger-breadths. A cubit is six handbreadths.&quot;, &quot;10. The scroll which I wrote had a width of four finger-breadths to each column. The columns containing the Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15.1-18) &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) were each six finger-breadths wide. The number of lines in each column were fifty-one. The number of columns in the whole scroll were 226 columns. The length of the entire scroll was 13366 finger-breadths approximately.&quot;, &quot;11. The six finger-breadths left over were for the margin at the beginning and end of the scroll. The parchment skins on which we wrote were ramskins. Whenever you desire to write a scroll and follow these measurements completely or approximately, you need not weary yourself to make a calculation if you have one, two or three columns less or more; you will find that the length will be equal to the circumference.&quot;, &quot;12. No sheet should have less than three, nor more than eight columns. If a sheet is wide enough to contain nine columns, it is cut into two parts, one to contain four columns, the other to contain five columns. This rule applies to the beginning and middle of the scroll. But at the close, even if there is only left one verse to write on a column, that column is prepared on a separate sheet and sewn on to the other sheets.&quot;, &quot;13. For sewing the sheets together, only the sinews of a clean beast domestic or wild, including those that are &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt; (literally torn), flesh of a beast that had suffered from a mortal lesion.&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014flesh of a beast that had died or had not been slaughtered, or had been slaughtered by an unqualified or disqualified person.&lt;/i&gt; may be used. The law here is the same as in regard to phylacteries. This rule goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. Hence if the sheets have been sewn together but not with sinews or with sinews of an unclean animal, the scroll is unfit for use till the stitches are taken out and the sewing is done according to rule.&quot;, &quot;14. When the sheets are sewn together, they are sewn entirely from top to bottom, but a small portion is left above and below without being stitched, so that the scroll, when it is rolled up, may not be torn in the middle. Two wooden rollers are prepared, one for either end. The unwritten margins of parchment at the beginning and at the end are brought round the rollers and sewn with sinews, so that the scroll can be rolled over them; a clear space being left between the margin and the writing in the columns.&quot;, &quot;15. In case a scroll of the law had one of its sheets torn, the rent is sewn up, if it extends to two lines; if it extends to three lines, it is not sewn up. This rule applies to a scroll the gall dressing of which is no longer perceptible. But if the parchment still shows that it has been dressed, then, even when the rent extends to three lines, it is sewn up. So too, a rent between columns or between words is sewn up. For the stitching of the rents, the same kind of sinews are used as for the sheets. And wherever there is a rent, the scribe should make sure that no letter is missing or altered in form.&quot;], [&quot;1. You thus find that there are twenty factors, any one of which disqualifies a scroll of the law. If any of these occurs, the scroll is like one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught. It does not possess the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, and is not used for reading in public worship. They are as follows:&quot;, &quot;1) If it was written on the skin of a beast of an unclean species;&quot;, &quot;2) or on the skin of a beast of a clean species, which had not been tanned;&quot;, &quot;3) If the skin had been tanned but not for the express purpose of being used as a scroll of the law;&quot;, &quot;4) If it was written on the wrong side; in the case of parchment of whole hide on the side next to the flesh; in the case of parchment of the outer half of a split hide, on the side adjacent to the hair;&quot;, &quot;5) If it was written partly on parchment of whole hide and partly on that made of the outer half of split hide;&quot;, &quot;6) If it was written on the inner half of a split hide;&quot;, &quot;7) If it was written without the lines having been previously ruled;&quot;, &quot;8) If it was written with a dark writing fluid that does not make a permanent impression;&quot;, &quot;9) If it was written in other languages;&quot;, &quot;10) If it was written by a heretic (Epikouros) or other disqualified persons;&quot;, &quot;11) If the scribe wrote the names of God without special concentration of mind;&quot;, &quot;12) If a single letter was omitted;&quot;, &quot;13) If a single letter was added;&quot;, &quot;14) If one letter touched another;&quot;, &quot;15)\\tIf a single letter was so marred that it cannot be read at all, or resembles another letter, whether the defect is in the writing, or is due to a perforation, rent or smudge;&quot;, &quot;16)\\tIf the scribe wrote letters so far apart or so closely together that one word looks like two words or two words look like one word;&quot;, &quot;17)\\tIf he altered the form of the sections&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Wrote an \\u201copen\\u201d section as if it were a \\u201cclosed\\u201d section or vice versa.&lt;/i&gt;;&quot;, &quot;18)\\tIf he varied the form of writing the Songs;&quot;, &quot;19)\\tIf he wrote any other portion in the form of a Song;&quot;, &quot;20)\\tIf he did not sew the sheets with sinews of a beast of a clean species.&quot;, &quot;The other conditions stated are recommended as the best way of performing the duty of writing a scroll. Their non-observance does not render it unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;2. A scroll of the law that is fit for use is to be regarded as an object of extreme holiness and treated with great reverence. A person is forbidden to sell a scroll of the law even if he has nothing to eat, and even if he owns other scrolls. He may not even sell an old scroll, to buy a new one. A scroll may only be sold for one of two purposes, to provide means to enable one to study Torah or to marry\\u2014and then only if the owner has nothing else that he can sell.&quot;, &quot;3. If a scroll of the law has become worn out or been otherwise rendered unfit for use; it is placed in an earthenware vessel and buried beside the remains of deceased scholars. This is the appropriate method of \\&quot;concealing\\&quot; it (putting it away). Folders of scrolls that have become worn out are used as shrouds for the dead (found on the road) whose interment is a duty binding on all. This is the appropriate method of \\&quot;concealing\\&quot; them.&quot;, &quot;4. A case specially made for a scroll of the law and in which it has been placed, bands around the scrolls, the chest or structure in which it is deposited even though the scroll is in its case, as also a bench specially made on which to place a scroll of the law, and on which a scroll was placed are all subsidiaries of that which is sacred, and may not be thrown away. When worn out or broken, they are \\&quot;put away\\&quot;. The platforms, however, on which the Reader of the congregation stands and holds the scroll and tablets on which (scriptures) are written for a child\&#39;s instruction have no sanctity. Golden and silver pomegranates and other such ornaments, made for the embellishment of a scroll of the law are subsidiaries of that which is sacred; and it is forbidden to part with them to be used for secular purposes, unless they were sold with the intention to purchase with their proceeds a scroll of the law or a book of the Pentateuch.&quot;, &quot;5. It is permitted to place one scroll of the law upon another scroll, or, needless to add, upon single books of the Pentateuch. Single books of the Pentateuch may be placed upon books of the Prophets or Hagiography. But the books of the prophets and of the Hagiography are not placed upon single books of the Pentateuch; nor the latter on a scroll of the law. No sacred writings, not even Halachas or Hagadas (Legalistic or Homiletic works) may be thrown away. Amulets which contain scriptural matter, must not be taken with one into a lavatory (privy) unless they are covered with a skin.&quot;, &quot;6. A person may not, while bearing a scroll of the law in his arms, enter a bath-house, lavatory, or cemetery, even if the scroll is swathed in folders and placed in its case. A person must not read in it till he has moved away four cubits from the dead body (bath house) or lavatory. One may not hold a scroll of the law when nude. It is forbidden to sit down on a couch on which there is a scroll of the law.&quot;, &quot;7. Cohabitation is forbidden in a chamber where there is a scroll of the law, till it has been removed or placed in a receptacle which is itself placed in a receptacle not specially assigned to the scroll. If it has however been so assigned, even ten receptacles within each other, are regarded as a single receptacle. If a partition, ten handbreadths high, has been constructed for the scroll, cohabitation may take place if there is no other room. It may not take place, if there is another room, till the scroll has been removed.&quot;, &quot;8. All who are ritually unclean, even women in their menstruating period, and even a non-Israelite, may hold a scroll of the law and read in it, for the words of the Torah do not contract uncleanliness, provided that the holder\&#39;s hands are not dirty or soiled. They must therefore wash their hands and then they may touch it.&quot;, &quot;9. Every one who sees a person carrying a scroll of the law and proceeding with it must stand up before it; and all persons continue standing till the bearer of the scroll stops, having carried it to its appointed place, or passes out of sight. They are then permitted to resume their seats.&quot;, &quot;10. It is a duty to assign a fixed place for a scroll of the law, and to show it extreme honor and courtesy. The words in the tables of the covenant are in every scroll of the law. One may not expectorate before a scroll of the law, nor indecently expose oneself before it, nor stretch out one\&#39;s feet before it; nor place it upon the head in the way in which a burden is carried; nor turn one\&#39;s back to it unless it is at an elevation of ten handbreadths above the person.&quot;, &quot;11. If one is travelling from place to place and had a scroll of the law with him, he is not to put the scroll in a sack, place it on the donkey\&#39;s back and ride upon it. If, however, he is afraid of thieves, he may do so. When there is no such apprehension, he places it in his bosom close to his heart, and continues his journey, riding. Any one, sitting before a scroll of the law, should be inspired with a sense of earnestness, awe and reverence, for it is a faithful witness concerning all who come into the world, as it is said, \\&quot;It shall be therefore a witness against thee\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:26). All possible honor should be shown it. The ancient sages said, \\&quot;Whoever treats the Torah with contumely will be treated with contumely by his fellow-creatures. Whoever honors the Torah, will receive honor from his fellow creatures\\&quot; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:8). End of the laws concerning the scroll of the Law by the Grace of God.&quot;]], &quot;versionTitle&quot;: &quot;The Mishneh Torah by Maimonides. trans. by Moses Hyamson, 1937-1949&quot;, &quot;versionSource&quot;: &quot;http://primo.nli.org.il/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=NLI&amp;docId=NNL_ALEPH002108865&quot;, &quot;language&quot;: &quot;en&quot;}&#39;], u&#39;apikey&#39;: [u&#39;kAEw7OKw5IjZIG4lFbrYxpSdu78Jsza67HgR0gRBOdg&#39;]}&gt;,

POST:&lt;QueryDict: {u&#39;json&#39;: [u&#39;{&quot;text&quot;: [[&quot;1. The four Pentateuchal sections, beginning respectively, \\&quot;Sanctify unto me\\&quot; (Ex. 13:1-10), \\&quot;And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee\\&quot; (Exodus 13:11-16)\\u2014these two being in the Book of Exodus, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) \\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13-21), are written and covered with a skin. These are called &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; and are placed upon the head and bound on the arm. The omission of the point of a single letter in any one of these sections bars, according to Scriptural enactment, the use of all of them. They must all be written perfectly and in accordance with rule.&quot;, &quot;2. This is the case also with the two sections of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; beginning respectively, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) and \\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). If the point of a letter is missing in these two sections, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may not, according to Scriptural enactment, be used. The two sections must be written perfectly. So too, a scroll of the Law, in which a single letter is missing, is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;3. There are ten points in regard to &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; (phylacteries). The observance of each is enjoined by a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. The neglect of any of them is an absolute bar to the use of the &lt;i&gt;Tephillin.&lt;/i&gt; Hence, if there was a variation in any one of them, the &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; are unfit for use. Two of these have reference to the writing; eight, to the covering and the tying of the straps. The two points to be observed in the writing are that the sections must be written with ink, and must be written on parchment.&quot;, &quot;4. How is the ink prepared? Soot of oils or of pitch, wax or similar substance is collected; kneaded with gum of trees and a little honey; thoroughly wetted and pounded till it is like wafers. It is then stored away. When the scribe wishes to write, he soaks it in water in which gall-apples or similar substances have been steeped, and with this fluid he writes. Such writing when erased leaves no mark. This is the best way to write scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs.&lt;/i&gt; If the scribe has written with fluid of the gall-oak or of caper,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Caper: flower-buds or seeds of a low shrub of Mediterranean countries, used as a condiment.&lt;/i&gt; since the writing stays and is not rubbed out, scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; so written are fit for use.&quot;, &quot;5. This being so, what is excluded by the Halacha, dating back to Moses, which ordains that these must be written with ink? It excludes pigments of other colors, such as red or green, etc.; so that if even a single letter in a scroll of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; was written with pigment of any other color [but black] or with gold, such a Scroll, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;6. There are three kinds of parchment, &lt;i&gt;Gewil, Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Duxustus.&lt;/i&gt; How are these made? A hide of domestic cattle or wild beast is taken. First, its hair is removed. It is then pickled in salt, afterwards prepared with flour and subsequently tanned with gall-wood or similar materials which contract the pores of the hide and make it durable. And this it is that is called &lt;i&gt;Gewil&lt;/i&gt; (parchment of whole-hide leather).&quot;, &quot;7. If, after removing the hair, the hide had been split through its thickness into two parts, so as to make of it two skins, one thin, namely that which had been next to the hair; the other thick, namely that which had been next to the flesh, and if these were prepared first with salt, then with flour and afterwards with gall-wood or similar substance the skin which had been next to the hair is called &lt;i&gt;Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; (= outer-skin parchment), and that which had been next to the flesh is called &lt;i&gt;Duxustus&lt;/i&gt; (inner-skin parchment).&quot;, &quot;8. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that the scroll of the Law should be written on &lt;i&gt;Gewil&lt;/i&gt; (whole hide parchment), and the writing should be on the side which had been next to the hair. The &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; should be written on &lt;i&gt;Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; (the exterior part of the split hide) and the writing should be on the side which had been nearer the flesh; and the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; should be written on &lt;i&gt;Duxustus&lt;/i&gt; (made of the inner part of the split hide), on the side which had been nearer the hair. If, on a &lt;i&gt;Kelaf,&lt;/i&gt; one writes on the side that had been next to the hair, or, on a &lt;i&gt;Gewil or Duxustus,&lt;/i&gt; one writes on the side that had been next to the flesh, the Scroll, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; so written is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;9. Though this is the rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai, yet if one writes a scroll of the Law on parchment made from the exterior half of a split hide it is fit for use. The reason why a complete hide is mentioned is in order to exclude that made from the inner half of the split hide. If one wrote on it a scroll of the Law, it is unfit for use. So also, if one wrote a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on the external half of a split hide or on an undivided hide, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use. The inner half of a split hide is recommended to be used, only as a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (specially approved).&quot;, &quot;10. Scrolls, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; are not written on the hide of a domestic or wild beast that is unclean or on the skin of an unclean bird. They are written on the hides of domestic or wild beasts that are clean or on the skins of clean birds, even when the flesh of these animals may not be eaten owing to their not having been slaughtered according to the ritual or being found to have suffered from a lesion of a mortal character. Nor are Scrolls, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; written on the skin of a fish, even if it be of a clean species, because of its foulness. For this is not removed by tanning.&quot;, &quot;11. The undivided skin for a scroll of the Law, and the external half of the hide to be used for &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or for a scroll of the Law must be tanned for their specific purposes. If they were not expressly so tanned, they are not fit for use. Accordingly, if a non-Israelite or a Samaritan tanned them, they are unfit for use. Even if the Samaritan was instructed to tan a particular hide for the purpose of its being used for a scroll of the Law or &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; it is unfit for use; since he works with his own purposes in mind, not with those of his employer. Hence, anything that has to be done with a purpose in mind, if done by a Samaritan, is unfit for use. The skin for a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; does not require to be tanned for that express purpose.&quot;, &quot;12. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that a scroll of the Law or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may only be written on parchment that is ruled. Phylacteries need not be ruled, because they are covered. So too, phylacteries and a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may be written from memory, as these sections are recited by and are familiar to everyone. But not a single letter may be written in a scroll of the Law, except from a written copy of the text.&quot;, &quot;13. A scroll of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; written by a heretic must be burnt. If written by a Samaritan, by a Jew converted to another faith, by one who surrenders Israelites to tyrants, by a slave, woman or minor, they are unfit for use, and must be hidden; for it is said, \\&quot;And thou shalt bind them\\&quot;, \\&quot;And thou shalt write them\\&quot;. The implication is that only that person is qualified to write them, who is charged with the duty of putting on &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and believes in the obligation. If they are found in the possession of a heretic, and it is not known who wrote them, they should be hidden. If found in the possession of a Samaritan or non-Israelite, they are fit to be used. Scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; are not to be bought from non-Israelites for more than their value, so as not to accustom the latter to steal these holy articles or take them by force.&quot;, &quot;14. A scroll of the Law, phylacteries or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth,&lt;/i&gt; written on the skin of a beast or bird\\u2014whether domestic or wild\\u2014which belongs to an unclean species, or written on skins that have not been tanned, and likewise a scroll of the Law or phylacteries written on skins not expressly tanned for those purposes, are unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;15. If one who writes a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; had not concentrated his mind while writing, and wrote one of the Names of God without express intent, these articles are unfit for use. Accordingly, when one is writing the name of God, even if an Israelite king greets him, he must not return the greeting. If he is writing two or three names of God, he may pause between writing one and writing the others and may respond.&quot;, &quot;16. After dipping the pen in ink to write the Name of God, the scribe does not start with a letter of the name but with a letter of the previous word. If he altogether forgot to write the name of God, he writes it above the line. But to write part of the name on the line and part above the line makes the scroll unfit for use. Other words that the scribe forgot to write may be written partly on the line and partly above it. These rules apply to a scroll of the Law. But in a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; or in phylacteries not a letter may be written above the line. If the scribe forgot even one letter, he must hide what he wrote and write a fresh slip. In all of them (Scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; and Phylacteries) it is permissible to write the name of God upon a surface from which writing has been erased or obliterated.&quot;, &quot;17. Scribes of scrolls, phylacteries and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; are forbidden to turn over the parchment sheet with its written surface beneath touching the board on which it lies, but should cover it with a cloth or fold it.&quot;, &quot;18. If, after a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; had passed out of the scribe\&#39;s hands, he makes the statement, \\&quot;I did not write the name of God in them with that purpose distinctly in mind\\&quot;, he is not believed to the extent of rendering them unfit for use, but his statement is accepted so far that he forfeits his entire remuneration. The reason why he is not believed so as to render them unfit for use is because his motive may possibly have been to cause a loss to the person who bought or hired them. It would seem however that his statement would only cause him to forfeit that quota of remuneration to which the writing of the names of God would entitle him. Hence, if he stated, \\&quot;the skins of this scroll of the Law or of these phylacteries were not expressly tanned for those purposes\\&quot;, then since in such a case he is believed so fully that he forfeits the whole of his remuneration, his statement is also credited so as to disqualify the articles from being used\\u2014it being a matter of general knowledge that if the skins had not been expressly tanned for the purpose of being made into phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, the scribe receives no remuneration whatsoever.&quot;, &quot;19. Phylacteries and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; may only be written in square Hebrew script. Permission was also given to write scrolls of the Law in Greek characters but not in those of any other foreign tongue. The ancient Greek script has gone out of use, been corrupted and become obsolete. Hence, at the present day, all three religious articles,\\u2014Scroll of the Law, Tephillin and Mezuzah,\\u2014are only written in the square Hebrew script. Care must be taken in writing that no letter shall adhere to any other letter; for any letter which is not completely surrounded on all four sides by a blank space of parchment has been improperly written. Any letter that cannot be read by a child of ordinary intelligence\\u2014not particularly bright or dull\\u2014is improperly written. Thus a &lt;i&gt;Yod&lt;/i&gt; must not be like a &lt;i&gt;Vav&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Vav&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Yod,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Koph&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Beth,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Beth&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Koph,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Daleth&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Resh,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Resh&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Daleth,&lt;/i&gt; etc., so that the reader may be able to read fluently.&quot;, &quot;20. If the parchment was perforated, the scribe must not write on the perforation. A perforation over which the ink passes is not regarded as a perforation, and it is permitted to write across it. Hence, it is permitted to write on the skin of a bird that has been tanned. Should the parchment have become perforated, after it has been written on, if the perforation is in the interior of a letter, as, for example, in a &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mem,&lt;/i&gt; etc., it is regarded as properly written. Should one of the sides of a letter have been perforated, so that the letter is divided\\u2014then the rule is that if there is left of the part that is unperforated as much as would form a small letter, it is regarded as properly written, provided that it does not resemble a different letter. If the part that is left unperforated is not as much as would form a small letter, it is not regarded as properly written.&quot;], [&quot;1. How are the sections in the phylactery that is placed on the head to be written? The four sections are respectively written on four separate slips of parchment; each slip is rolled up separately and they are then placed in four compartments composed of one skin. As to the phylactery placed on the arm, these four sections are written in four columns on one slip of parchment. This slip is rolled up like a scroll of the Law from the last column to the first and is placed in one [leather] compartment.&quot;, &quot;2. The scribe must exercise care in writing these sections, for if he wrote a closed section as an open one,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*that is, began the section on a new line where only a space of nine letters should have been left blank.&lt;/i&gt; or wrote an open section as if it were closed, the slip is unfit for use. The first three sections are, all of them, open. The last section, that beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass, if ye will hearken diligently\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is closed.&quot;, &quot;3. He must exercise care in regard to the words that are &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**with or without a &lt;i&gt;Yod&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Vav,&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&lt;/i&gt; that all the four sections should be written as they are in an examined scroll of the Law. For if he wrote a word &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; that should have been written &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; the slip is unfit for use till the superfluous letter has been obliterated. If a word that is &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; has been written &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; the slip is unfit for use and cannot be made good. The following is the list of the words in these four sections that are &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&quot;, &quot;[&lt;i&gt;For paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 (lists of&lt;/i&gt; plene &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; defective &lt;i&gt;words), see the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 121b and 122a&lt;/i&gt;.]&quot;, &quot;6. The &lt;i&gt;Ayin&lt;/i&gt; of Shema and &lt;i&gt;Daleth&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Echad&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 6:4) are to be written in larger type.&quot;, &quot;8. He must pay attention to the \\&quot;crowns\\&quot; (tittles) above the letters. These are like an upright &lt;i&gt;Zayin&lt;/i&gt; and are placed on each letter to which such a crown belongs as written in the scroll of the Law. The following are the letters in the four sections thus ornamented:&quot;, &quot;9. In the first section, there is only one such letter, namely the closed &lt;i&gt;Mem&lt;/i&gt; in Meeyamim which has over it three &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. In the second section, there are five letters, each of them a &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9;&lt;/i&gt; and on each, there are four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. These are the &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Unesanah; the first and the last &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Hikshah; the &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Vayaharog; the &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Yadchah.&quot;, &quot;10. The third section has five such letters. The &lt;i&gt;Koof&lt;/i&gt; in Uvekoomecha has over it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines; the &lt;i&gt;Koof&lt;/i&gt; in Ukeshartam has over it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines; the two letters &lt;i&gt;Teth,&lt;/i&gt; and the letter &lt;i&gt;P\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Letotaphoth have on each of them four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines.&quot;, &quot;11. The fourth section has five such letters. The &lt;i&gt;P\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; of Veasaphta has above it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. The &lt;i&gt;Tav&lt;/i&gt; of Veasaphta has one &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped line. The two letters &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; and the letter &lt;i&gt;P\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Letotaphoth have on each of them four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. Altogether, the letters thus ornamented are sixteen. If the scribe wholly omitted these ornaments, added to them or omitted them over some of the letters, he has not rendered the phylacteries unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;12. If one buys phylacteries from one who is not a recognized expert, he has to examine them. If he bought from him one hundred parchment slips, he examines three slips, either two of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the arm or two slips of those in the phylacteries worn on the arm and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head. If he found all these three correct, a presumption is established in the vendor\&#39;s favour, and all his phylacteries are fit for use and the rest need not be examined. If he bought them however in several bundles, this examination (of three slips) must take place in each bundle, there being a presumption that the several bundles came from different individuals.&quot;, &quot;13. A man who wrote phylacteries with his own hand or purchased them from an expert or, having bought them of a non-expert, examined them and replaced them in their leather containers, need never re-examine them, even after the lapse of many years. As long as the leather container remains sound, the presumption that they are sound holds good. Nor is it apprehended that a letter has been obliterated or perforated. Hillel the Elder was wont to say, \\&quot;These phylacteries belonged to my mother\&#39;s father.\\&quot;&quot;], [&quot;1. There are eight rules for the making of phylacteries; all of them are traditionally ascribed to Moses who received them on Sinai; hence the observance of all of them is indispensable. A variation from any of them renders the phylacteries unfit for use. The rules are as follows: The phylacteries (that is, the external leather containers) must be square; they are to be sewn in such a way as to retain the square shape; their diagonals must be those of a square so that all the angles shall be equal; the leather container of the phylactery for the head shall have the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; embossed on the right and on the left side; each of the slips of parchment on which the sections from the Pentateuch are written is to be wrapt in a cover; this is to be tied with hair, and then the slips are placed in their respective compartments which are sewn up with sinews; a border with a fold open at both ends shall be made of the skin of the base for the strap to pass through freely; the straps shall be black, and have the special knot, that is known to all, in the shape of a &lt;i&gt;Daleth.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;2. How is the phylactery for the head made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length, breadth and height. It is of no consequence however if the height is more than the breadth or less. What is essential is that the length and breadth shall be equal. Three grooves are cut in the block so that it is divided into four parts as in this figure &lt;img src=\\&quot;data:image/jpg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEBLAEsAAD/2wBDAAUDBAQEAwUEBAQFBQUGBwwIBwcHBw8LCwkMEQ8SEhEP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\\nClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUH//Z\\n\\&quot;&gt;. A piece of leather is taken and soaked in water. The wooden block is put in it and the leather is inserted into each groove. While it is still damp, it is crinkled on both sides, to make a shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; with three lines on the right side of the wearer and with four lines on the left side.&quot;, &quot;3. The leather is left on the wood till it dries; it is then slipped off from the wooden block, with the result that it has the shape of four compartments. The prescribed sections of Scripture written on slips of parchment are placed, one in each compartment. A portion of the leather is drawn round and beneath the cube (to form its base). This is sewn up at its four sides. A portion is left in this skin at the base for the strap to pass through as in a loop. This it is which is called the bridge.&quot;, &quot;4. How are the phylacteries for the arm made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length and breadth. It is to be a finger-breadth in height, or a little more or less. The block is covered with wet leather which is left on till it dries. It is then removed, and in the place where the wood had been, a single slip of parchment on which the four prescribed sections of Scripture are written, is inserted. A portion of the leather is drawn round below and is sewn up at its four sides. Of this base a part is left to form a loop for the strap to pass through.&quot;, &quot;5. What is the order in which the sections are placed in the phylactery for the head? The last section, that beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye will hearken diligently\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is placed in the first compartment, to the right of the wearer; the section beginning, \\&quot;Hear O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4) in the compartment adjacent to it; the section beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God will bring thee\\&quot; (Exodus 13:11), next to the one containing the section, \\&quot;Hear O Israel\\&quot;, and the section beginning, \\&quot;Sanctify unto me every first born\\&quot; (Exodus 13:1) in the fourth compartment which would be to the left of the wearer of the phylactery; so that anyone facing the wearer and reading what is before him would read the sections in the right Scriptural order as in the annexed figure. If there&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Sections beginning with verse:&lt;/i&gt; was a deviation from this order, the phylacteries are not fit for use.&quot;, &quot;6. The sections for the phylactery for the arm are written in four columns on one long strip of parchment like a scroll of the Law, and in the order in which they are found in the Pentateuch as in the annexed figure.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**Sections beginning with verse:&lt;/i&gt; If the scribe wrote them on four separate slips and placed them in one compartment, he has done what is required, and need not attach them to each other.&quot;, &quot;7. When he rolls up the parchment slips containing the sections, for the phylacteries worn on the head or on the arm, he rolls them from the end to the beginning so that, if opened, each section can be read from the beginning to the end.&quot;, &quot;8. When the slips are about to be placed in their respective compartments, they are wrapped in a cloth, over which they are fastened with hair. They are then deposited in their compartments. This hair must be that of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species; and may even be taken from animals which are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;***&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;***&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014died of itself or, by extension of meaning, not properly killed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;\\u2020&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;\\u2020&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014torn by wild beast; by extension of meaning, found to have suffered from mortal disease or lesion.&lt;/i&gt; The custom that has come into general use is to fasten the slips with hair taken from calves\&#39; tails.&quot;, &quot;9. The leather receptacles of the phylacteries are only sewn with sinews of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species, and may be taken from animals of such species even if they are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014died of itself or, by extension of meaning, not properly killed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014torn by wild beast; by extension of meaning, found to have suffered from mortal disease or lesion.&lt;/i&gt; The sinews used are those found in the heel of the domestic or wild beast, which are white and tough. They are softened by pounding them with stones or similar substances, till they become like flax. They are spun and twined, and then used for sewing the phylacteries and the sheets of the scrolls of the Law.&quot;, &quot;10. The receptacles are to be sewn in such a way as to preserve the square contour of the base. It is a broadly established rule that on each side, there are to be three stitches, making altogether twelve stitches, whether the phylactery is for the arm or for the head. If the scribe desires to make ten or fourteen stitches, he may do so. The stitch must pass through the leather on both sides.&quot;, &quot;11. The grooves of the phylacteries for the head ought to extend to the base where the stitching is done. If the grooves are recognizable so that the four divisions clearly appear, the phylacteries are fit for use, even though the grooves do not extend to the base. If however the grooves are not recognizable, the phylacteries are unfit for use. Within each groove, above the leather, a thread or cord ought to be passed so as to separate the compartments from each other. The general custom is to draw through each of the three grooves a sinew of the same kind as those used for the stitches.&quot;, &quot;12. How are the thongs fixed? A strip of leather is taken as wide as the length of a barley corn. If wider, it is fit for use. The length of the strap of the phylactery for the head should be sufficient to encircle the head, form the knot and leave enough for the straps on either side to reach to the navel or a little higher. The strap for the phylactery of the arm should be sufficiently long to encircle the forearm, form the knot, extend down to the middle finger, about which it is to be wound three times and then fastened. If the straps exceed in length the foregoing dimensions, they are also fit for use.&quot;, &quot;13. The thong of the phylactery for the head is inserted in the loop open at both ends. It is measured to fit the wearer\&#39;s head, and then tied in a rectangular knot like a &lt;i&gt;Daleth.&lt;/i&gt; This knot, every scholar should learn how to make. It is impossible to teach its form by description; this can only be taught by ocular demonstration. In the case of the phylactery for the arm, the thong is tied in a knot in the shape of a &lt;i&gt;Yod.&lt;/i&gt; The thong of the phylactery for the arm should move freely in the loop, so that the wearer can loosen or tighten it when he puts it on his arm.&quot;, &quot;14. The thongs of the phylacteries, whether for the head or for the arm, must have their exterior surface black. This is a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. But the other side of the thongs, being close to the skin, are fit for use if they are green or white. They must not however be red, for if the thong were inadvertently turned, the color of its lower surface would subject the wearer to ignominy. The lower side of the thongs should not be otherwise in color than the base of the leather case containing the parchment slips. If the latter is green, the former should be green; if white, the former should be white. It is comely if the phylacteries are wholly black, namely, both the case containing the slips of parchment and the thongs.&quot;, &quot;15. The leather which forms the receptacles of the phylacteries and its thongs is to be made from the hide of a domestic or wild quadruped or skin of a fowl that belongs to the clean species, and may even be taken from those of these species that are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Terefah.&lt;/i&gt; If they were made of the skin or hide of unclean species, or if the phylacteries were covered with gold, the phylacteries are unfit for use. The leather for the thongs must be expressly tanned for their intended purpose to be thongs of phylacteries. The leather which forms the receptacles for the phylacteries need not be tanned. Even if it consists of raw hide it is fit for use. Many places have the custom to make them of raw hide.&quot;, &quot;16. The receptacles of the phylacteries may not be prepared by any one but an Israelite; for the making of these is like the writing of the prescribed sections because of the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; which is embossed on the phylactery for the head, as we have already stated. Hence, if a non-Israelite made or sewed the phylacteries, they are unfit for use. So too, whoever is disqualified from writing the prescribed sections for the phylacteries may not prepare them.&quot;, &quot;17. The phylactery for the head may not be transformed into a phylactery for the arm, but the latter may be changed into the former; on the principle that an object may not be degraded from a higher to a lower sacred use. So too, the thong of the phylactery for the head may not be transferred to a phylactery for the arm. This rule only applies to phylacteries that had been worn. But with regard to phylacteries for the head that no one had ever worn, if it is desired to transform them into phylacteries for the arm, this may be done. How is this effected? It is covered with leather so that it appears as one receptacle. The phylactery may then be bound on the arm.&quot;, &quot;18. In case the stitches of the phylacteries are broken, they become unfit for use if there are two broken stitches adjacent to each other, or three not adjacent. This rule applies to old phylacteries. New phylacteries are fit for use as long as they keep their surface unimpaired. The following would be called new. If, at the place where the stitches have given way, part of the leather is held in the hand so that the phylactery is suspended, and the leather is strong enough not to be further torn, such phylacteries would be regarded as new. If however the leather is not strong enough to bear the weight of the phylacteries so suspended, but would tear, such phylacteries are regarded as old.&quot;, &quot;19. A thong that has become broken is not to be tied together nor sewn up; but it is to be removed, put away, and replaced by a new thong. The parts of the broken thong are unfit for use unless the length and breadth of the part is of the prescribed dimension or larger. Care should always be taken that the external surface of the thongs should be above, when the phylacteries are bound on the hand or round the head. End of the chapter.&quot;], [&quot;1. Where is the phylactery of the head placed? It is placed on that part of the crown of the head, where the hair adjacent to the forehead ends, and this is the place where an infant\&#39;s brain pulsates (the fontanelle). The phylactery needs to be adjusted so that it lies in the centre of the forehead, in a line with the point between the eyes. The knot should be at the top of the back of the neck, which is the end of the skull.&quot;, &quot;2. The phylactery of the hand is bound on the left arm over the biceps muscle which is the flesh that stands out on the upper arm that is intermediate between the shoulder-blade and forearm, so that when the upper arm is held close to the ribs, the phylactery will be opposite the heart and thus the precept will be fulfilled, \\&quot;And these words \\u2026 shall be upon thine heart\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:6).&quot;, &quot;3. To lay the phylactery of the hand on the palm or that of the head on the forehead is the practice of the Sadducees. He who makes the phylactery round like a nut is not fulfilling the precept in any way. A left-handed person lays the phylactery on his right arm, used by him as his left. If one is ambidextrous, he lays it on his left arm, which is the same as the left arm of any other person. The places where the phylacteries are respectively bound and laid are known by tradition.&quot;, &quot;4. The lack of a phylactery for the head does not preclude one from putting on that of the hand, nor does the lack of a phylactery of the hand preclude one from putting on that for the head. Each is a duty separate and independent. What blessings are recited? For the phylactery of the head, the formula is as follows: \\&quot;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and given us a command concerning the precept of phylacteries\\&quot;. For that of the hand, the form is as follows: \\&quot;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to lay the phylacteries\\&quot;.&quot;, &quot;5. This rule applies to the case where a person puts on one phylactery only. But when one lays both phylacteries, he recites one blessing, namely, the form, \\&quot;And hast commanded us to lay the phylacteries\\&quot;, binds the phylactery on his arm, and then puts on that for the head. When they are removed, that on the head is removed first, and afterwards that on the arm.&quot;, &quot;6. When a person has recited the blessing, \\&quot;Who hast commanded us to lay phylacteries\\&quot;, and bound the phylactery on his arm, he is forbidden to converse, even to the extent of acknowledging his master\&#39;s greeting, till he has put on the phylactery of the head. If he conversed he has committed a transgression; and when putting on the phylactery for the head, he must recite another blessing, viz: the form, \\&quot;Who hast given us a command concerning the precept of the phylacteries\\&quot;, and then he puts on the phylactery for the head.&quot;, &quot;7. On each occasion when one puts on phylacteries, the blessing is recited, even if they are removed and put on again several times in the day. It is a universal rule with regard to religious precepts that the appropriate blessings are recited prior to their performance. Hence too, the blessing for the phylactery of the hand has to be recited after it is placed on the biceps muscle before the thong is tightened, for the fastening constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.&quot;, &quot;8. When a person removes his phylacteries, and puts them in a bag, he should not place the phylactery of the hand beneath and that for the head above it, because when he will again have occasion to put them on, he will come into contact with the phylactery of the head first, will thus be under the necessity of putting it down and take out the phylactery of the hand, the former not being put on before the latter. It is forbidden to leave a precept and pass on to the fulfillment of another religious duty, the rule being that the duty that first presents itself should first engage our attention. Hence, the phylactery for the hand should be placed above so that one may come into contact with it first, and the phylacteries be put on in the right order.&quot;, &quot;9. A bag expressly intended to contain phylacteries and into which these have been placed, becomes consecrated and may not be put to secular use. If the bag was intended for this express purpose of containing phylacteries but had never contained them, or if phylacteries had been casually placed in a bag not set aside for that use, it does not become sacred, and continues to be a secular object as it had been hitherto. Phylacteries may not be suspended by their thong or by the part which contains the scriptural section. But the bag containing the phylacteries may be suspended.&quot;, &quot;10. The proper time for putting on phylacteries is when it is day and not when it is night, for it is said, \\&quot;Day by day\\&quot;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Usually rendered, \\u201cfrom year to year\\u201d, referring to observance of the feast of Passover.&lt;/i&gt; (Exodus 13:10). \\&quot;The ordinance\\&quot; mentioned in this verse refers to the precept of phylacteries. So it is said, \\&quot;And it shall be for a sign\\&quot;, while Sabbaths and festivals are them-also, Sabbaths and festivals are not seasons for putting on phylacteries, for selves a sign. When is the proper time in the day to put on phylacteries? At the hour when a person can see his neighbour at a distance of four cubits and recognize him. The period extends till sunset.&quot;, &quot;11. A person who put on phylacteries before sunset, is permitted when it becomes dusk, to continue to wear them, even throughout the night. The multitude however is not to be so taught. Everyone should be instructed not to wear phylacteries at night, but to remove them at sunset. Whoever deliberately puts on phylacteries after sunset, violates a prohibition, for it is said, \\&quot;And thou shalt keep this ordinance in its season, day by day\\&quot; (Exodus 13:10).&quot;, &quot;12. If the sun sets while a man with the phylacteries on his head was on the road, he places his hand upon the phylactery till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If Sabbath or a festival arrived while he was sitting in the house of study, with the phylactery on his head, he places his hand upon it till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If there is a house near the City Wall,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*the house of study was outside the town.&lt;/i&gt; where the phylacteries could be safely left, he should leave them there. If he did not remove them after sunset, because he had no place where they would be safe, and he kept them on for the sake of security, his conduct is lawful.&quot;, &quot;13. One who is exempt from reading the &lt;i&gt;Shema&lt;/i&gt; is exempt from putting on phylacteries. If a child less than thirteen years of age knows how to take care of his phylacteries, his father purchases a set for him, so as to train him in the practice of religious precepts. Those who suffer intestinal troubles or have difficulty in controlling their sphincters are exempt from the obligation of putting on phylacteries. All who are ritually unclean are under the same obligation of putting on phylacteries as those who are ritually clean. One, who is in pain or whose mind is not calm and composed is exempt from the duty of putting on phylacteries; for the wearer must not allow his consciousness of them to wander. Priests while engaged in the temple service, Levites during the recital of hymns in their appointed places, Israelites while they are in the Sanctuary, are exempt from the duties of reciting the prayers and putting on phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;14. As long as one is wearing phylacteries, he should frequently touch them with his fingers, so as not to lose consciousness of them for a single moment. For their degree of sanctity is higher than that of the golden plate which the High Priest wore on his forehead. On the latter, the name of God was engraved once only, while the phylactery for the head contains the tetragrammaton twenty-one times, and the phylactery for the arm, an equal number of times.&quot;, &quot;15. A requisite in wearing phylacteries is physical cleanliness. One should take care that no flatus escapes him while he has them on. Hence, he may not, while wearing them, indulge in regular sleep or even doze. But if they are covered with a cloth, he may doze, even while wearing them. How so? He places his head between his knees and dozes in a sitting posture. If his phylacteries were folded and held in his hand, the holder may even sleep in the regular way.&quot;, &quot;16. No meal, unless it be of a casual character, may be eaten, while one wears phylacteries (without previous preparation). Before proceeding to a regular meal, he removes them, places them on the table, washes his hands, puts them on again, recites the blessing for food while he has them on.&quot;, &quot;17. If one feels a call of nature while wearing phylacteries, he is not to deposit them, before entering the lavatory, in the crevices that open towards the public thoroughfare, lest passers-by may take them. How should he act? Even if he needs to relieve the bladder while he is at a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, he should remove the phylacteries, roll them up in his garment, as a scroll is rolled up, grasp them in his right hand opposite his heart, taking care that not a thong projects outside his hand as much as a hand breadth; then he enters, relieves himself, and, after having left, goes away to a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, and puts on his phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;18. This rule only applies to the case of a permanent lavatory. But one may not enter an extemporized lavatory with phylacteries even rolled up. They should be removed and given to another person for safe keeping.&quot;, &quot;19. If one wearing phylacteries needed to go to the lavatory at eventide when there would be no more time to put them on again, he should not enter with the phylacteries rolled up in his garment, even to relieve his bladder, if the lavatory is a permanent one. How should he act? He should remove the phylacteries, place them in their bag which must be at least a hand breadth long, or even in a smaller bag provided it is not specially assigned as a receptable for phylacteries. This he keeps in his hand and enters. Thus, too, at night time, if he needs to visit the lavatory, he may put the phylacteries in a bag which he keeps in his hand when entering.&quot;, &quot;20. Translation omitted.&quot;, &quot;21. Translation omitted.&quot;, &quot;22. One is permitted to put on phylacteries in that portion of a bathhouse where all are attired. In that portion where some are in their attire while others are nude, the phylacteries which one wears need not be removed, but they may not be put on. Where all are nude, the phylacteries must be removed, and needless to add, they may not be put on.&quot;, &quot;23. A person should not walk in a cemetery with phylacteries on his head. When he is within a distance of four cubits from a corpse or a grave, the phylacteries are to be removed till he has passed on to a distance outside four cubits. Phylacteries must not be put on before one is decently covered and has put on his garments. If a person is carrying a burden on his head, he must remove the phylactery from his head, and may not put it on till he has removed the burden. Even a kerchief [alone] may not be put upon the head when one is wearing phylacteries. But he puts his cap over the phylactery.&quot;, &quot;24. In a room where there are phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, marital intercourse may not take place, till these have been taken out, or placed in a receptacle which itself is enclosed in another receptacle not assigned to the use of phylacteries or a scroll of the Law. If the latter receptacle has been so assigned, and even if there be ten such receptacles, they are all regarded as one receptacle. If he placed the sacred articles in two receptacles, one within the other, they may be put for security under his pillow between the bolster and the coverlid\\u2014not however exactly beneath his head. This may be done even if his wife shares his couch.&quot;, &quot;25. The sanctity of phylacteries is a high degree of sanctity. As long as phylacteries are on a man\&#39;s head and arm, he is humble and God-fearing, is not drawn into frivolity and idle talk, does not dwell on evil thoughts but occupies his mind with thoughts of truth and righteousness. A man should therefore endeavour to wear phylacteries the whole day, this being the right way of fulfilling the precept. It is said of &lt;i&gt;Rav,&lt;/i&gt; the disciple of our Sainted Teacher (R. Judah, the Prince), that throughout his life no one saw him, without Torah, Tzitzis (fringes on his garments) or phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;26. Although the proper mode of fulfilling the precept is to wear phylacteries the whole day, it is especially a duty to do so during the recital of prayers. The sages say, \\&quot;Whoever reads the &lt;i&gt;Shema&lt;/i&gt; without wearing phylacteries is regarded as testifying falsely in his own person.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*He recites the Commandment to wear &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and does not fulfill it.&lt;/i&gt; Whoever does not wear phylacteries at all violates eight affirmative precepts, since in each of the four sections, the command is set forth to lay phylacteries on the head and on the arm. Whoever wears phylacteries regularly will be blessed with longevity, as it is said, \&#39;The Lord is upon them: they shall live\&#39;\\&quot; (Isaiah 38:16).&quot;], [&quot;1. How is the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**Sections of Scripture placed on doorposts.&lt;/i&gt; written? Two sections of the Pentateuch, those beginning, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4) and, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) are written in a single column on one slip of parchment. A space of half a nail\&#39;s breadth is left as a margin above and below the column. If the Pentateuchal sections were written in two or three columns, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use. They must not however be written in the shape of a tail (broad at the top line and gradually narrowing to a point), or of a circle, or of a tent (narrow at the top and broadening to the base). A &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; written in any of these forms is unfit for use. If the text was written out of order, for example, if the second section was in front of the first, it is unfit for use. If it was written on two slips of parchment, even though these were sewn together, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use. A Scroll of the Law that has become worn out or phylacteries that are worn out may not be used for a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Nor may margins cut off from a scroll of the Law be so used; for anything dedicated to a sacred purpose may not be degraded from a higher to a lower degree of sacredness.&quot;, &quot;2. It is a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (an act of piety) to separate the section beginning, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; from that beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass\\&quot; by a \\&quot;closed\\&quot; space (blank of nine letters). If the division between the two sections was an \\&quot;open\\&quot; one (the second section beginning a new line), the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use, as, in the Pentateuch, the second section does not immediately follow the first. Special heed should be paid to the tittles in the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; The following are the tittles which are made in the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;3. In the first section, there are seven letters, each of which should have above it three upright lines in the shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Zain.&lt;/i&gt; They are the &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ayin&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Shema; Nun&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nafshecha;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Totafoth.&lt;/i&gt; The second section has six letters, each of which should have above it three &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. They are the &lt;i&gt;Gimel&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Degancha;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Totafoth;&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;Tzadi&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Ha-aretz.&lt;/i&gt; If the tittles were omitted or if they are more or less than those specified, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; has not been rendered unfit for use. But if it was written without the lines having been ruled, or if the scribe paid no heed to &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; letters, or if he added in the text even a single letter, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;4. It is a universal custom to write the word &lt;i&gt;Shaddai&lt;/i&gt; (Almighty) on the other side of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; opposite the blank space between the two sections. As this word is written on the outside, the practice is unobjectionable. They, however, who write names of angels, holy names, a Biblical text or inscriptions usual on seals, within the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; are among those who have no portion in the world to come. For these fools not only fail to fulfill the commandment but they treat an important precept that expresses the Unity of God, the love of Him, and His worship, as if it were an amulet to promote their own personal interests; for, according to their foolish minds, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is something that will secure for them advantage in the vanities of the world.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*A reproof to those who sell Mezuzoth to be worn as amulets !&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;5. It is a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (act of piety) to write &lt;i&gt;Al Ha-aretz&lt;/i&gt; (the last two words) on the last line, either at the beginning or in the middle of the line. All the scribes follow the custom of writing the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; in twenty-two lines, and (the last two words) &lt;i&gt;Al Ha-aretz&lt;/i&gt; at the commencement of the last line. The following are the words in order, which begin each of the lines: (See the Hebrew text on the corresponding right-hand side, page 127b.)&quot;, &quot;6. When the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is folded, it is rolled up from the end of the line to the beginning, so that anyone opening it is able to read it from the beginning to the end of the line. After it has been rolled up, it is placed in a cylinder of reed, wood or other material, which is attached to the doorpost with a nail; or else a cavity is hollowed out in the doorpost, into which the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is inserted.&quot;, &quot;7. Before one affixes it to the doorpost, he recites the blessing, \\&quot;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us to affix the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah\\&quot;.&lt;/i&gt; No blessing is recited at the time when it is written, because the affixing of it constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.&quot;, &quot;8. If one suspended it on a staff, it is unfit, for this is not affixing it (to the doorpost). If one placed it behind the door, he has not fulfilled the precept. If he perforated the door and forced the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; into it like a nail, as a bolt is inserted in the staple-ring, it is unfit. If it was placed in a hollow of the doorpost at a depth of a hand-breadth, it is unfit. If one cut a stick, put a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on it, attached this stick to other sticks and made of them all a doorpost, it is unfit, because the affixing of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; preceded the erection of the doorpost.&quot;, &quot;9. The &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; of a private dwelling is examined once every seven years; that attached to a public building twice in the Jubilee (fifty years). The object is to ascertain whether a letter has been torn away or obliterated; because owing to the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; being affixed to walls, it is liable to decay.&quot;, &quot;10. The fulfillment of the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is incumbent upon all Israelites, including women and slaves (of Israelites). Children under the age of thirteen years are trained to affix the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; to their rooms. One who rents a dwelling outside the Holy Land, or lodges at an inn in the Holy Land is exempt from the obligation of affixing a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; for a period of thirty days after beginning his occupancy. But if one rents a home in the Holy Land, the duty of affixing a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; devolves immediately.&quot;, &quot;11. If one lets a dwelling to another person, the duty devolves upon the lessee to bring a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; and attach it, even if he has to pay for doing so, for the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is the personal obligation of the occupant and not an obligation attaching to the structure. When he surrenders possession, he must not, on quitting the premises, remove the Mezuzah. But if the owner is a non-Israelite, the Jewish tenant, when leaving, takes it away.&quot;], [&quot;1. There are ten conditions which must exist in a dwelling, to put the occupant under an obligation to affix a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If one of these is absent, he is exempt. These are as follows: The dwelling must have a superficial area of four cubits by four cubits or more; it must have two door-posts, a lintel, a roof and doors; the entrance should be ten hand-breadths high or more; it must be a secular (not a sacred) structure; it must have been erected for human occupancy, for honored use (not a lavatory), and built for permanent habitation.&quot;, &quot;2. A dwelling, the superficial area of which is less than four cubits by four cubits does not require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If its area is equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits, even if it is circular in shape or has five angles, or, needless to add, if its length is greater than its breadth, it requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; provided that it covers an area equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits.&quot;, &quot;3. A porch, that is a place with three walls and a roof, even though it has two uprights on the fourth side does not need a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; the uprights serving to support the roof and not as doorposts. Thus too, a roof without walls that rests on pillars on either side, even if it presents the appearance of a dwelling is exempt from the obligation of having a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; on account of its having no doorposts\\u2014the pillars having been erected to support the roof.&quot;, &quot;4. A dwelling with posts on either side (of the door), and in the place of the lintel an arch in the shape of a bow, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; provided that the posts are ten hand-breadths high or more. If they are not ten hand-breadths high, there is no such obligation, as the dwelling has no lintel.&quot;, &quot;5. A dwelling without a roof does not require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Where part of it is covered with a roof and part uncovered, it seems to me that if the portion over the entrance is roofed, the structure requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; After the doors are set up, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is affixed.&quot;, &quot;6. The Temple Mount, its chambers and courts, synagogues and houses of study which have no residences are exempt, because they are sacred. A village synagogue in which transients lodge requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; So too, a city synagogue which has a dwelling house attached to it, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; None of the Temple entrances had a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; except the Gate of Nikanor, and the gate within that gate, and the entrance to the Chamber of Parhedrin, because this chamber was the High Priest\&#39;s residence during his seven days of seclusion (prior to the Day of Atonement).&quot;, &quot;7. A hayloft, a cattle-shed, a wood store and a barn are exempted from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because of the phrase, \\&quot;thy house\\&quot; (in the text \\&quot;thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house\\&quot;), which means a dwelling assigned to thy use and excludes the aforementioned and similar classes of buildings. Hence, a cattle-shed, where women stay adorning themselves, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because it also serves as a human habitation. A lodge or porch\\u2014either rectangular or circular\\u2014leading to a garden, a garden and a sheepfold are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because they are not constructed to serve as residences. If dwellings requiring a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; open to these places, the latter must also have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;8. Hence, entrances, whether leading to courtyards or to passages, and gates of districts or cities, must each have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because dwellings which require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; open on to them. Even where ten rooms open one to the other, each requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; just as the innermost room requires it. This is the reason for the rule that a gate opening from the garden to a courtyard requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;9. A privy, bath-house, ritual bath-house, tannery and similar places are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; because they are not erected to serve as dwellings for honored use. The tabernacle for the feast of Tabernacles, and a room in a ship are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; because they are not made for permanent occupancy. Of two potter\&#39;s booths, one leading to the other, the exterior is exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because it is not permanent. Shops in market places are exempt, because they are not intended to be used as residences.&quot;, &quot;10. A dwelling with several doors, although only one is regularly used for coming in and going out, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; affixed to each door. A small door between a dwelling (below) and the attic needs a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Every room in a dwelling, even a room within a room, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; at the entrance of the inner chamber, of the outer chamber and of the house, for they all serve the purpose of residence and are permanent.&quot;, &quot;11. A door between a house of study or synagogue and a private house, if used habitually for entering and leaving, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If a door is between two dwellings, the position of the hinge determines the side on which the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is to be fixed. The side on which the hinge is visible is regarded as the dwelling in reference to which the position of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is decided.&quot;, &quot;12. Where is the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; to be fixed? Within the width of the doorpost, a hand-breadth from the external edge at a height of a third of the elevation of the entrance, counting from the top. If placed higher it is fit in position, provided that it is a hand-breadth lower than the lintel. It should be fixed on the right side of one entering; if placed on the left side, it is unfit for use. A house owned by partners requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;13. A person should pay heed to the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah;&lt;/i&gt; for it is an obligation perpetually binding upon all. Whenever one enters or leaves a home with the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on the doorpost, he will be confronted with the Declaration of God\&#39;s Unity, blessed be His holy name; and will remember the love due to God, and will be aroused from his slumbers and his foolish absorption in temporal vanities. He will realize that nothing endures to all eternity save knowledge of the Ruler of the Universe. This thought will immediately restore him to his right senses and he will walk in the paths of righteousness. Our ancient teachers said: He who has phylacteries on his head and arm, fringes on his garment and a Mezuzah on his door may be presumed not to sin, for he has many monitors\\u2014angels that save him from sinning, as it is said, (Psalms 34:8) \\&quot;The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them\\&quot;.&quot;], [&quot;1. It is an affirmative precept binding upon every individual Israelite to write a scroll of the Law for his own use, as it is said, \\&quot;Now therefore write ye this Song for you\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:19). As the Torah is not written in separate sections, this text means, \\&quot;Write for yourselves the Torah in which this Song is contained.\\&quot; Even if one\&#39;s ancestors have left a person a scroll, it is a religious duty to write a scroll at his own expense. If he wrote it with his own hand, it is accounted to him as if he had received it from Sinai. If one does not know how to write a scroll, he should get others to write it for him. He who corrects a scroll, even a single letter of it, is regarded as if he had written it completely.&quot;, &quot;2. A king has the duty of writing for himself another scroll of the Law, in his capacity as sovereign, in addition to the scroll which he owns in his private capacity, as it is said, \\&quot;And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law, etc.\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:18). This copy is corrected by comparison with a scroll kept in the temple court, and under the authority of the Supreme Judicature. The scroll which the king had possessed when he was a private individual, he places in his archives. The one that he wrote or had written for him when he became king, should always be with him. If he goes to war, the scroll is to be with him. When he enters his home, it is to be with him. When he hears a cause (tries a case) it is to be with him. When he sits down to a meal, it is to be placed before him, as it is said, \\&quot;And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:19).&quot;, &quot;3. If he possessed no scroll before he came to the throne, he has to write, after his accession, two scrolls of the law, one of which he places in his archives, while the other is to be always with him. It must never be away from him, except at night, or when he goes to the bath or the lavatory or lies down on his couch to sleep.&quot;, &quot;4. A scroll of the Law that has been written without having been ruled, or that has been written partly on parchment made of whole hide and partly on that made of the inner half of split hide is unfit for use. It must be entirely written either on the former or on the latter. How is a scroll of the law to be written? The scribe is to use the correct script and it should also be exceedingly fine. Between one word and another, he is to leave the space of a small letter; between one letter and another (in the same word) the space of a hair\&#39;s breadth; between one line and the next the space of a line. The length of each line is to be thirty letters, wide enough to write the word Le-Mi-Sh-Pe-Ch-O-S-E-Che-M&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Ten consonant letters printed here in capital letters. See also below.&lt;/i&gt; three times. This is to be the width of each column. No line shall be shorter, so that the column shall not look like an epistle. Nor should any line be wider so that the reader\&#39;s eyes should not have to wander across the sheet.&quot;, &quot;5. He should not diminish the size of the characters in order to leave a space between one paragraph and another. When he comes (at the end of a line) to a word of five letters, he must not write two within the column and three outside the column; but he is to write three letters within the column and two outside the column. If there is not enough space left at the end of the line to write three letters, he is to leave it blank and begin at the commencement of the next line.&quot;, &quot;6. If at the end of a line, he has a word of two letters to write, he may not place it between the columns (that is, outside the column) but he writes it at the beginning of the next line. If, before the line is filled up, he has a word of ten letters, more or less, to write and there is not enough space left on the line to write it all within the column, if he is able to write half the word within the column and half outside the column, he may do so. If he cannot do this, he leaves the space blank and writes the word at the beginning of the next line.&quot;, &quot;7. Between each book and the next, he leaves a space of four lines, no more and no less, blank without any writing, and starts the next book at the beginning of the fifth line. When completing the Torah, he is to finish it in the middle of the line at the end of the column. If several lines of the column would be left, he shortens the lines, so as to begin at the beginning of the last line of the column and not complete it, and also so plans the lines that the final words &lt;i&gt;Le-\\u00e9n\\u00e9 Chol Yisrael&lt;/i&gt; (\\&quot;in the sight of all Israel\\&quot;) shall be in the middle of the line at the end of the column.&quot;, &quot;8. He should pay careful attention to the letters that are written large or small, to the letters that are punctuated with dots above them, to the letters that are written differently to the others, such as the letter P\\u00e9 and the letters that are curved, in the way the scribes have carried on the tradition. He is to pay attention to the tittles&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*lines over each of the letters &lt;i&gt;Shin, Ayin, Teth, Nuen, Zayin, Gimel, Tzadi&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; and the number of them in each case\\u2014one letter having above it a single tittle, another having seven tittles. All the tittles have the shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; and are to be thin as a hair.&quot;, &quot;9. All these provisoes are only stated in order that the duty of writing a scroll shall be observed in the most perfect way. If, however the scribe made changes in the method here set forth, was not careful in regard to the tittles, writing however all the letters correctly, or if he wrote the lines close together or far apart, extended the lines or shortened them\\u2014since he did not join any letter to another, omit aught or add aught, mar the form of any letter, nor make any variation in regard to which paragraphs should be open and which closed, the scroll is fit for use.&quot;, &quot;10. There are other rules mentioned in the Talmud which the scribes observe as a tradition handed down from one to another. They are as follows: The number of lines in each column shall not be less than forty-eight and not more than sixty; the blank spaces between one section and another shall be such that nine letters, e.g., A She R, A She R, A She R, can be written in it. The five lines preceding the Song at the Red Sea (Exodus 14:28, 29, 30, 30, 31) shall begin respectively with the words &lt;i&gt;Habaim, Bayabashah, Hashem, Mes, Bemitzraim.&lt;/i&gt; The five lines after it shall begin respectively with the words &lt;i&gt;Vatikach, Achareha, Sus, Vayetz\\u00eb\\u00fc, Vayav\\u00f6\\u00fc&lt;/i&gt; (Exodus 15:20, 20, 21, 22, 23). The six lines before the Song of Moses beginning &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) shall respectively commence with the words &lt;i&gt;Veaeedah, Achar\\u00e9, Haderech, Beacharith, Lehacheeso, Kehal&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 31:28, 29, 29, 29, 29, 30); and the five lines after the Song of Moses shall begin with the words &lt;i&gt;Vayabo, Ledabber, Asher, Hazoth, Asher&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:44, 45, 46, 46, 47). All these points of observance are to enable us to fulfill the duty in the best way. Variations in these particulars do not render the scroll unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;11. But if the scribe wrote &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; a word that should be &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or vice versa; or a word traditionally pronounced differently to the way it is written, according to the traditional pronunciation, for example, if he wrote &lt;i&gt;Yishkevenoh&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Yishgelenoh,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Oovatechorim&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Oova-apolim,&lt;/i&gt; etc.; or if he wrote an \\&quot;open\\&quot; section as if it were a closed section or vice versa; or if he wrote one of the Songs like the ordinary prose text, or an ordinary section in the form of one of the Songs, the scroll is unfit for use as a scroll of the Law. It has not the sacredness of a scroll of the Law, but is like any one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught.&quot;, &quot;12. A scroll of the Law, which has not been examined for correctness may not be kept longer than thirty days. It must either be corrected or segregated.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*put away and not be used.&lt;/i&gt; A scroll of the Law which has three errors in each column should be corrected. If there are four, it must be put away. If the greater portion has been found to be correct, and the remainder has four errors in each column, but there is even one column in this erroneous portion with less than four errors, corrections could be made.&quot;, &quot;13. This rule only applies to cases where the scribe wrote &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; words that should be written &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; so that he would be under the necessity of inserting the letters that he forgot between the lines. But if he wrote &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; words that are &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; even if every column contains several errors, he corrects them, as he only erases and does not have to insert letters between the lines.&quot;, &quot;14. It is permitted to write the Pentateuch, each book in a separate scroll. These scrolls have not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law that is complete. One may not however write a scroll containing some sections. Such a scroll may not be written for a child\&#39;s instruction. This is permitted, however, where there is the intention to complete the remainder of the book. If one wrote such a scroll with three words on each line, this is permitted.&quot;, &quot;15. The Pentateuch, the Prophets and the Hagiography may be put together in one volume. In such a case, a space of four lines is left blank between each book of the Pentateuch and the next; a space of three lines between each of the major Prophets and the next; and a space of three lines between each of the twelve minor prophets and the next, so that he can, if he wishes, separate any book. The order of the prophetical books is as follows: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah, the Twelve Minor Prophets. The order of the books of the Hagiography is: Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel, Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.&quot;, &quot;16. None of The Holy Scriptures may be written except on ruled lines, even if they are written on paper: Three words of Scripture may be written without ruling the line, but to write more is forbidden. A volume containing the Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiography has not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, but of a single book of the Pentateuch. The scroll which contains more than the entire Pentateuch is in the same class as that which contains less than the entire Pentateuch, on the principle that excess is similar to deficiency.&quot;], [&quot;1. The &lt;i&gt;open&lt;/i&gt; section has two forms. If the previous section ended in the middle of a line, the scribe leaves the remainder of the line blank and commences the open section at the beginning of the next line. This only applies to the case where, after the conclusion of the previous section, there is left sufficient space on the line to write nine letters. But if the space left is less, or if the previous section was completed at the end of the line, the next line must be left blank, and the open section is begun at the commencement of the third line.&quot;, &quot;2. A &lt;i&gt;closed&lt;/i&gt; section has three forms. If the previous section ended within the line, the scribe leaves a blank space for the required dimension (enough to write nine letters) and begins the closed section at the end of the line, provided that there is a blank space between it and the preceding section. If the completion of the previous section did not leave space for the blank of the required breadth and for writing (at least) one word at the end of the line, the scribe should leave the remainder of the line blank, leave a little space at the beginning of the next line blank, and begin the closed section within the line. If the previous section ended at the close of the line, he leaves a blank space of the required breadth (nine letters), at the beginning of the next line, and begins to write the closed section within the line. Hence, you may say that an open section always begins within the line.&quot;, &quot;3. A scroll which is inaccurate in regard to words that are written &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; can be made good by being corrected, as already explained. But if the scribe made a mistake in the spacing between the sections, and wrote an open section as if it were a closed section, or a closed section as if it were an open section or left a space where a section does not end, or continued writing without leaving a space where a section ends, or deviated from the form in which the Songs are written, in all these cases, the Scroll is unfit for use and there is no remedy except to remove the entire column in which the mistake occurs.&quot;, &quot;4. As in all the scrolls I have seen, I noticed serious incorrectness in these regards, while authorities on the Massorah, who write treatises and compilations with the aim of pointing out the sections that are closed and those that are open, differ according to the variations in the scrolls on which they rely, I deemed it fit to write here a list of the sections which are closed and those which are open, as also the forms in which the Songs of the Pentateuch are written so that all the scrolls may be corrected from, and compared with them. The copy on which I relied is the well-known Egyptian codex which contains the twenty-four books of the Scriptures and which had been in Jerusalem for several years\\u2014used as the standard text for the examination of scrolls. Everyone relied upon it because it had been examined by Ben Asher who closely studied it for many years and examined it again whenever it was being copied. This codex was the text on which I relied in the scroll of the Law that I wrote according to the rules.&quot;, &quot;(Here follow lists of open and closed sections which are in the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 131b to 136b.)&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF GENESIS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 43; of closed sections 48; total 91.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF EXODUS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 69; of closed sections, 95; total 164.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 52; of closed sections, 46; total 98.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF NUMBERS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 92; of closed sections, 66; total 158.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections of this book is 34; of closed sections, 124, total 158. The number of open sections in the entire Pentateuch is 290; of the closed sections, 379; total 669.&quot;, &quot;The form of the Song &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43). Every line has a blank space in the middle, like that preceding a closed section. Hence, every line is divided into two parts. The song is written in 70 lines. The words at the beginning of the lines are as follows:&quot;, &quot;(See the Hebrew text on the right hand side page 136a)&quot;, &quot;All these are the words at the beginning of the lines. And the following are the words at the beginning of the latter half of the line which are in the middle of the column.&quot;, &quot;(See the Hebrew text on the right hand pages 136a and 136b)&quot;, &quot;The Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15:1-19) is written in thirty lines, the first line in the ordinary way; the other lines, one with a blank space in the middle, the next with blank spaces in two places, so that the line is divided into three parts and so a blank space corresponds to writing (above and below it) and vice versa as follows.&quot;, &quot;See the Hebrew text on the right-hand side 136a, 136b and 137a as it should be written in the scroll. The English pages should be blank.&quot;, &quot;Throughout the Torah, in the Songs as well as in the rest of the text, the scribe should aim to write all the letters of each word close together, taking care that no letter should be joined to another, and that no letter should be so far away from the next as to make the word seem two words. The interval between the letters in one word should be a hairbreadth. If the scribe wrote one letter so far apart from the other that it would appear to a child who is not familiar with the text like two words, the scroll is unfit for use till he makes the correction.&quot;], [&quot;1. The length of a scroll of the Law should not exceed the circumference, nor should the circumference exceed the length. What is a suitable length? Where parchment of a whole hide is used, six hand-breadths, that is twenty-four finger-breadths taking the thumb as the standard. Where the parchment of the external half of the hide is used, the length may be more or less than this dimension, provided only that the length is equal to the circumference. So also in the case of parchment of a whole hide, if the scribe made the length less than six hand-breadths and wrote in a small hand or longer than six handbreadths and spread out the writing so that the length of the column is equal to the circumference\\u2014this too is correct.&quot;, &quot;2. The extent of the lower margin is four finger-breadths; of the upper margin, three finger-breadths; between one column and another, two finger-breadths. Hence, on the right and left of every sheet of parchment, the scribe has to leave a margin a finger-breadth wide and enough beside for sewing; so that, when the sheets are sewn together, there will be throughout the scroll a blank space of two finger-breadths between the columns. The scribe must leave in addition enough margin at the beginning and end of the scroll to fold a blank column round the rollers. All these dimensions are to be observed in order to fulfill the precept properly. But if the scribe exceeded or fell short of them, he does not render the scroll unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;3. How shall one proceed so that the length of the scroll shall turn out equal to its circumference. The parchment sheets are made evenly rectangular; each sheet being six handbreadths wide, all of the same dimensions. They are rolled evenly into one bundle tightly rolled up. And skins are added and tightly rolled till the circumference is six handbreadths, which is the width of the sheets. This is measured with a thread of wool which is placed round the bundle.&quot;, &quot;4. The scribe then fashions a straight ruler, forty or fifty finger-breadths long; one of these finger-breadths, he marks in two, three and four equal parts so as to be able to measure off a half, a third and a quarter of a finger-breadth and similar fractions. With this, he measures each sheet, so as to ascertain the number of finger-breadths it contains and so determine how many finger-breadths there are in the entire bundle.&quot;, &quot;5. He then takes two or three other sheets of parchment, to test the size of the characters, and writes on them one column. The length of a column of writing is obviously seventeen finger-breadths as a margin must be left, of three finger-breadths above and four finger-breadths below. The width of the column will depend on the handwriting, whether it is large or small. So also, the number of lines will vary according to the handwriting, as between each line and the next, the space of a line must be left.&quot;, &quot;6. Having written the column which he uses as a test as he pleases, he measures its breadth by means of the finger-breadths of the ruler, and adds two finger-breadths for the margin between column and column. He then calculates how many columns of such writing would fill the sheets in the bundle he had made up. Having ascertained the total number of columns, he will then see how much of the entire Pentateuch is in the column which he wrote as a test. He will make the estimate with the aid of the scroll which serves him as a copy, and calculate accordingly. If the number of columns of the kind of writing which he wrote is sufficient for the whole Torah\\u2014well and good. If the calculation showed that there are more columns than are required for the whole Torah, he will enlarge the writing, so as to diminish the number of columns, and he will make a test with another column. If the calculation shows that for the writing of the Torah more columns will be required than are contained in his sheets, he will use smaller characters and so secure a larger number of columns. He will make the test with column after column till the calculation comes out exact.&quot;, &quot;7. Once he knows the width of the column and the size of the characters, he can begin writing the scroll with that bundle of sheets. He then divides the parchment (sheets) into columns by ruling them off,\\u2014each column of the same width as that which his tests and calculations showed to be the right size. If three or four finger-breadths are left over beyond the last column, he should leave one finger-breadth and enough besides for sewing the sheet to the next, and cut off the rest, and need feel no apprehension, for at the end, more sheets will be added to make up for the superfluous strips that he cut off from each sheet. Nor need he make any calculations in regard to this, for the writing will be according to the number of columns.&quot;, &quot;8. So too, if one wishes to make the width of the scroll more or less than six handbreadths, he makes his calculation in the same way; and the length will be exactly equal to the circumference neither more nor less, provided that no mistake has been made in the calculation.&quot;, &quot;9. The finger-breadth in all the dimensions here and in the rest of the Torah is that of the medium sized finger. On careful examination, we find it to be the breadth of seven medium sized barley corns placed close together, this being equal to the length of two barley corns measured liberally. The handbreadth, wherever mentioned, is equal to four such finger-breadths. A cubit is six handbreadths.&quot;, &quot;10. The scroll which I wrote had a width of four finger-breadths to each column. The columns containing the Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15.1-18) &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) were each six finger-breadths wide. The number of lines in each column were fifty-one. The number of columns in the whole scroll were 226 columns. The length of the entire scroll was 13366 finger-breadths approximately.&quot;, &quot;11. The six finger-breadths left over were for the margin at the beginning and end of the scroll. The parchment skins on which we wrote were ramskins. Whenever you desire to write a scroll and follow these measurements completely or approximately, you need not weary yourself to make a calculation if you have one, two or three columns less or more; you will find that the length will be equal to the circumference.&quot;, &quot;12. No sheet should have less than three, nor more than eight columns. If a sheet is wide enough to contain nine columns, it is cut into two parts, one to contain four columns, the other to contain five columns. This rule applies to the beginning and middle of the scroll. But at the close, even if there is only left one verse to write on a column, that column is prepared on a separate sheet and sewn on to the other sheets.&quot;, &quot;13. For sewing the sheets together, only the sinews of a clean beast domestic or wild, including those that are &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt; (literally torn), flesh of a beast that had suffered from a mortal lesion.&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014flesh of a beast that had died or had not been slaughtered, or had been slaughtered by an unqualified or disqualified person.&lt;/i&gt; may be used. The law here is the same as in regard to phylacteries. This rule goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. Hence if the sheets have been sewn together but not with sinews or with sinews of an unclean animal, the scroll is unfit for use till the stitches are taken out and the sewing is done according to rule.&quot;, &quot;14. When the sheets are sewn together, they are sewn entirely from top to bottom, but a small portion is left above and below without being stitched, so that the scroll, when it is rolled up, may not be torn in the middle. Two wooden rollers are prepared, one for either end. The unwritten margins of parchment at the beginning and at the end are brought round the rollers and sewn with sinews, so that the scroll can be rolled over them; a clear space being left between the margin and the writing in the columns.&quot;, &quot;15. In case a scroll of the law had one of its sheets torn, the rent is sewn up, if it extends to two lines; if it extends to three lines, it is not sewn up. This rule applies to a scroll the gall dressing of which is no longer perceptible. But if the parchment still shows that it has been dressed, then, even when the rent extends to three lines, it is sewn up. So too, a rent between columns or between words is sewn up. For the stitching of the rents, the same kind of sinews are used as for the sheets. And wherever there is a rent, the scribe should make sure that no letter is missing or altered in form.&quot;], [&quot;1. You thus find that there are twenty factors, any one of which disqualifies a scroll of the law. If any of these occurs, the scroll is like one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught. It does not possess the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, and is not used for reading in public worship. They are as follows:&quot;, &quot;1) If it was written on the skin of a beast of an unclean species;&quot;, &quot;2) or on the skin of a beast of a clean species, which had not been tanned;&quot;, &quot;3) If the skin had been tanned but not for the express purpose of being used as a scroll of the law;&quot;, &quot;4) If it was written on the wrong side; in the case of parchment of whole hide on the side next to the flesh; in the case of parchment of the outer half of a split hide, on the side adjacent to the hair;&quot;, &quot;5) If it was written partly on parchment of whole hide and partly on that made of the outer half of split hide;&quot;, &quot;6) If it was written on the inner half of a split hide;&quot;, &quot;7) If it was written without the lines having been previously ruled;&quot;, &quot;8) If it was written with a dark writing fluid that does not make a permanent impression;&quot;, &quot;9) If it was written in other languages;&quot;, &quot;10) If it was written by a heretic (Epikouros) or other disqualified persons;&quot;, &quot;11) If the scribe wrote the names of God without special concentration of mind;&quot;, &quot;12) If a single letter was omitted;&quot;, &quot;13) If a single letter was added;&quot;, &quot;14) If one letter touched another;&quot;, &quot;15)\\tIf a single letter was so marred that it cannot be read at all, or resembles another letter, whether the defect is in the writing, or is due to a perforation, rent or smudge;&quot;, &quot;16)\\tIf the scribe wrote letters so far apart or so closely together that one word looks like two words or two words look like one word;&quot;, &quot;17)\\tIf he altered the form of the sections&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Wrote an \\u201copen\\u201d section as if it were a \\u201cclosed\\u201d section or vice versa.&lt;/i&gt;;&quot;, &quot;18)\\tIf he varied the form of writing the Songs;&quot;, &quot;19)\\tIf he wrote any other portion in the form of a Song;&quot;, &quot;20)\\tIf he did not sew the sheets with sinews of a beast of a clean species.&quot;, &quot;The other conditions stated are recommended as the best way of performing the duty of writing a scroll. Their non-observance does not render it unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;2. A scroll of the law that is fit for use is to be regarded as an object of extreme holiness and treated with great reverence. A person is forbidden to sell a scroll of the law even if he has nothing to eat, and even if he owns other scrolls. He may not even sell an old scroll, to buy a new one. A scroll may only be sold for one of two purposes, to provide means to enable one to study Torah or to marry\\u2014and then only if the owner has nothing else that he can sell.&quot;, &quot;3. If a scroll of the law has become worn out or been otherwise rendered unfit for use; it is placed in an earthenware vessel and buried beside the remains of deceased scholars. This is the appropriate method of \\&quot;concealing\\&quot; it (putting it away). Folders of scrolls that have become worn out are used as shrouds for the dead (found on the road) whose interment is a duty binding on all. This is the appropriate method of \\&quot;concealing\\&quot; them.&quot;, &quot;4. A case specially made for a scroll of the law and in which it has been placed, bands around the scrolls, the chest or structure in which it is deposited even though the scroll is in its case, as also a bench specially made on which to place a scroll of the law, and on which a scroll was placed are all subsidiaries of that which is sacred, and may not be thrown away. When worn out or broken, they are \\&quot;put away\\&quot;. The platforms, however, on which the Reader of the congregation stands and holds the scroll and tablets on which (scriptures) are written for a child\&#39;s instruction have no sanctity. Golden and silver pomegranates and other such ornaments, made for the embellishment of a scroll of the law are subsidiaries of that which is sacred; and it is forbidden to part with them to be used for secular purposes, unless they were sold with the intention to purchase with their proceeds a scroll of the law or a book of the Pentateuch.&quot;, &quot;5. It is permitted to place one scroll of the law upon another scroll, or, needless to add, upon single books of the Pentateuch. Single books of the Pentateuch may be placed upon books of the Prophets or Hagiography. But the books of the prophets and of the Hagiography are not placed upon single books of the Pentateuch; nor the latter on a scroll of the law. No sacred writings, not even Halachas or Hagadas (Legalistic or Homiletic works) may be thrown away. Amulets which contain scriptural matter, must not be taken with one into a lavatory (privy) unless they are covered with a skin.&quot;, &quot;6. A person may not, while bearing a scroll of the law in his arms, enter a bath-house, lavatory, or cemetery, even if the scroll is swathed in folders and placed in its case. A person must not read in it till he has moved away four cubits from the dead body (bath house) or lavatory. One may not hold a scroll of the law when nude. It is forbidden to sit down on a couch on which there is a scroll of the law.&quot;, &quot;7. Cohabitation is forbidden in a chamber where there is a scroll of the law, till it has been removed or placed in a receptacle which is itself placed in a receptacle not specially assigned to the scroll. If it has however been so assigned, even ten receptacles within each other, are regarded as a single receptacle. If a partition, ten handbreadths high, has been constructed for the scroll, cohabitation may take place if there is no other room. It may not take place, if there is another room, till the scroll has been removed.&quot;, &quot;8. All who are ritually unclean, even women in their menstruating period, and even a non-Israelite, may hold a scroll of the law and read in it, for the words of the Torah do not contract uncleanliness, provided that the holder\&#39;s hands are not dirty or soiled. They must therefore wash their hands and then they may touch it.&quot;, &quot;9. Every one who sees a person carrying a scroll of the law and proceeding with it must stand up before it; and all persons continue standing till the bearer of the scroll stops, having carried it to its appointed place, or passes out of sight. They are then permitted to resume their seats.&quot;, &quot;10. It is a duty to assign a fixed place for a scroll of the law, and to show it extreme honor and courtesy. The words in the tables of the covenant are in every scroll of the law. One may not expectorate before a scroll of the law, nor indecently expose oneself before it, nor stretch out one\&#39;s feet before it; nor place it upon the head in the way in which a burden is carried; nor turn one\&#39;s back to it unless it is at an elevation of ten handbreadths above the person.&quot;, &quot;11. If one is travelling from place to place and had a scroll of the law with him, he is not to put the scroll in a sack, place it on the donkey\&#39;s back and ride upon it. If, however, he is afraid of thieves, he may do so. When there is no such apprehension, he places it in his bosom close to his heart, and continues his journey, riding. Any one, sitting before a scroll of the law, should be inspired with a sense of earnestness, awe and reverence, for it is a faithful witness concerning all who come into the world, as it is said, \\&quot;It shall be therefore a witness against thee\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:26). All possible honor should be shown it. The ancient sages said, \\&quot;Whoever treats the Torah with contumely will be treated with contumely by his fellow-creatures. Whoever honors the Torah, will receive honor from his fellow creatures\\&quot; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:8).

                    <td class="code"><pre>u&#39;{&quot;text&quot;: [[&quot;1. The four Pentateuchal sections, beginning respectively, \\&quot;Sanctify unto me\\&quot; (Ex. 13:1-10), \\&quot;And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee\\&quot; (Exodus 13:11-16)\\u2014these two being in the Book of Exodus, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) \\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13-21), are written and covered with a skin. These are called &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; and are placed upon the head and bound on the arm. The omission of the point of a single letter in any one of these sections bars, according to Scriptural enactment, the use of all of them. They must all be written perfectly and in accordance with rule.&quot;, &quot;2. This is the case also with the two sections of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; beginning respectively, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) and \\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). If the point of a letter is missing in these two sections, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may not, according to Scriptural enactment, be used. The two sections must be written perfectly. So too, a scroll of the Law, in which a single letter is missing, is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;3. There are ten points in regard to &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; (phylacteries). The observance of each is enjoined by a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. The neglect of any of them is an absolute bar to the use of the &lt;i&gt;Tephillin.&lt;/i&gt; Hence, if there was a variation in any one of them, the &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; are unfit for use. Two of these have reference to the writing; eight, to the covering and the tying of the straps. The two points to be observed in the writing are that the sections must be written with ink, and must be written on parchment.&quot;, &quot;4. How is the ink prepared? Soot of oils or of pitch, wax or similar substance is collected; kneaded with gum of trees and a little honey; thoroughly wetted and pounded till it is like wafers. It is then stored away. When the scribe wishes to write, he soaks it in water in which gall-apples or similar substances have been steeped, and with this fluid he writes. Such writing when erased leaves no mark. This is the best way to write scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs.&lt;/i&gt; If the scribe has written with fluid of the gall-oak or of caper,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Caper: flower-buds or seeds of a low shrub of Mediterranean countries, used as a condiment.&lt;/i&gt; since the writing stays and is not rubbed out, scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; so written are fit for use.&quot;, &quot;5. This being so, what is excluded by the Halacha, dating back to Moses, which ordains that these must be written with ink? It excludes pigments of other colors, such as red or green, etc.; so that if even a single letter in a scroll of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; was written with pigment of any other color [but black] or with gold, such a Scroll, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;6. There are three kinds of parchment, &lt;i&gt;Gewil, Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Duxustus.&lt;/i&gt; How are these made? A hide of domestic cattle or wild beast is taken. First, its hair is removed. It is then pickled in salt, afterwards prepared with flour and subsequently tanned with gall-wood or similar materials which contract the pores of the hide and make it durable. And this it is that is called &lt;i&gt;Gewil&lt;/i&gt; (parchment of whole-hide leather).&quot;, &quot;7. If, after removing the hair, the hide had been split through its thickness into two parts, so as to make of it two skins, one thin, namely that which had been next to the hair; the other thick, namely that which had been next to the flesh, and if these were prepared first with salt, then with flour and afterwards with gall-wood or similar substance the skin which had been next to the hair is called &lt;i&gt;Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; (= outer-skin parchment), and that which had been next to the flesh is called &lt;i&gt;Duxustus&lt;/i&gt; (inner-skin parchment).&quot;, &quot;8. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that the scroll of the Law should be written on &lt;i&gt;Gewil&lt;/i&gt; (whole hide parchment), and the writing should be on the side which had been next to the hair. The &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; should be written on &lt;i&gt;Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; (the exterior part of the split hide) and the writing should be on the side which had been nearer the flesh; and the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; should be written on &lt;i&gt;Duxustus&lt;/i&gt; (made of the inner part of the split hide), on the side which had been nearer the hair. If, on a &lt;i&gt;Kelaf,&lt;/i&gt; one writes on the side that had been next to the hair, or, on a &lt;i&gt;Gewil or Duxustus,&lt;/i&gt; one writes on the side that had been next to the flesh, the Scroll, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; so written is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;9. Though this is the rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai, yet if one writes a scroll of the Law on parchment made from the exterior half of a split hide it is fit for use. The reason why a complete hide is mentioned is in order to exclude that made from the inner half of the split hide. If one wrote on it a scroll of the Law, it is unfit for use. So also, if one wrote a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on the external half of a split hide or on an undivided hide, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use. The inner half of a split hide is recommended to be used, only as a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (specially approved).&quot;, &quot;10. Scrolls, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; are not written on the hide of a domestic or wild beast that is unclean or on the skin of an unclean bird. They are written on the hides of domestic or wild beasts that are clean or on the skins of clean birds, even when the flesh of these animals may not be eaten owing to their not having been slaughtered according to the ritual or being found to have suffered from a lesion of a mortal character. Nor are Scrolls, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; written on the skin of a fish, even if it be of a clean species, because of its foulness. For this is not removed by tanning.&quot;, &quot;11. The undivided skin for a scroll of the Law, and the external half of the hide to be used for &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or for a scroll of the Law must be tanned for their specific purposes. If they were not expressly so tanned, they are not fit for use. Accordingly, if a non-Israelite or a Samaritan tanned them, they are unfit for use. Even if the Samaritan was instructed to tan a particular hide for the purpose of its being used for a scroll of the Law or &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; it is unfit for use; since he works with his own purposes in mind, not with those of his employer. Hence, anything that has to be done with a purpose in mind, if done by a Samaritan, is unfit for use. The skin for a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; does not require to be tanned for that express purpose.&quot;, &quot;12. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that a scroll of the Law or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may only be written on parchment that is ruled. Phylacteries need not be ruled, because they are covered. So too, phylacteries and a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may be written from memory, as these sections are recited by and are familiar to everyone. But not a single letter may be written in a scroll of the Law, except from a written copy of the text.&quot;, &quot;13. A scroll of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; written by a heretic must be burnt. If written by a Samaritan, by a Jew converted to another faith, by one who surrenders Israelites to tyrants, by a slave, woman or minor, they are unfit for use, and must be hidden; for it is said, \\&quot;And thou shalt bind them\\&quot;, \\&quot;And thou shalt write them\\&quot;. The implication is that only that person is qualified to write them, who is charged with the duty of putting on &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and believes in the obligation. If they are found in the possession of a heretic, and it is not known who wrote them, they should be hidden. If found in the possession of a Samaritan or non-Israelite, they are fit to be used. Scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; are not to be bought from non-Israelites for more than their value, so as not to accustom the latter to steal these holy articles or take them by force.&quot;, &quot;14. A scroll of the Law, phylacteries or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth,&lt;/i&gt; written on the skin of a beast or bird\\u2014whether domestic or wild\\u2014which belongs to an unclean species, or written on skins that have not been tanned, and likewise a scroll of the Law or phylacteries written on skins not expressly tanned for those purposes, are unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;15. If one who writes a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; had not concentrated his mind while writing, and wrote one of the Names of God without express intent, these articles are unfit for use. Accordingly, when one is writing the name of God, even if an Israelite king greets him, he must not return the greeting. If he is writing two or three names of God, he may pause between writing one and writing the others and may respond.&quot;, &quot;16. After dipping the pen in ink to write the Name of God, the scribe does not start with a letter of the name but with a letter of the previous word. If he altogether forgot to write the name of God, he writes it above the line. But to write part of the name on the line and part above the line makes the scroll unfit for use. Other words that the scribe forgot to write may be written partly on the line and partly above it. These rules apply to a scroll of the Law. But in a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; or in phylacteries not a letter may be written above the line. If the scribe forgot even one letter, he must hide what he wrote and write a fresh slip. In all of them (Scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; and Phylacteries) it is permissible to write the name of God upon a surface from which writing has been erased or obliterated.&quot;, &quot;17. Scribes of scrolls, phylacteries and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; are forbidden to turn over the parchment sheet with its written surface beneath touching the board on which it lies, but should cover it with a cloth or fold it.&quot;, &quot;18. If, after a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; had passed out of the scribe\&#39;s hands, he makes the statement, \\&quot;I did not write the name of God in them with that purpose distinctly in mind\\&quot;, he is not believed to the extent of rendering them unfit for use, but his statement is accepted so far that he forfeits his entire remuneration. The reason why he is not believed so as to render them unfit for use is because his motive may possibly have been to cause a loss to the person who bought or hired them. It would seem however that his statement would only cause him to forfeit that quota of remuneration to which the writing of the names of God would entitle him. Hence, if he stated, \\&quot;the skins of this scroll of the Law or of these phylacteries were not expressly tanned for those purposes\\&quot;, then since in such a case he is believed so fully that he forfeits the whole of his remuneration, his statement is also credited so as to disqualify the articles from being used\\u2014it being a matter of general knowledge that if the skins had not been expressly tanned for the purpose of being made into phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, the scribe receives no remuneration whatsoever.&quot;, &quot;19. Phylacteries and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; may only be written in square Hebrew script. Permission was also given to write scrolls of the Law in Greek characters but not in those of any other foreign tongue. The ancient Greek script has gone out of use, been corrupted and become obsolete. Hence, at the present day, all three religious articles,\\u2014Scroll of the Law, Tephillin and Mezuzah,\\u2014are only written in the square Hebrew script. Care must be taken in writing that no letter shall adhere to any other letter; for any letter which is not completely surrounded on all four sides by a blank space of parchment has been improperly written. Any letter that cannot be read by a child of ordinary intelligence\\u2014not particularly bright or dull\\u2014is improperly written. Thus a &lt;i&gt;Yod&lt;/i&gt; must not be like a &lt;i&gt;Vav&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Vav&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Yod,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Koph&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Beth,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Beth&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Koph,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Daleth&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Resh,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Resh&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Daleth,&lt;/i&gt; etc., so that the reader may be able to read fluently.&quot;, &quot;20. If the parchment was perforated, the scribe must not write on the perforation. A perforation over which the ink passes is not regarded as a perforation, and it is permitted to write across it. Hence, it is permitted to write on the skin of a bird that has been tanned. Should the parchment have become perforated, after it has been written on, if the perforation is in the interior of a letter, as, for example, in a &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mem,&lt;/i&gt; etc., it is regarded as properly written. Should one of the sides of a letter have been perforated, so that the letter is divided\\u2014then the rule is that if there is left of the part that is unperforated as much as would form a small letter, it is regarded as properly written, provided that it does not resemble a different letter. If the part that is left unperforated is not as much as would form a small letter, it is not regarded as properly written.&quot;], [&quot;1. How are the sections in the phylactery that is placed on the head to be written? The four sections are respectively written on four separate slips of parchment; each slip is rolled up separately and they are then placed in four compartments composed of one skin. As to the phylactery placed on the arm, these four sections are written in four columns on one slip of parchment. This slip is rolled up like a scroll of the Law from the last column to the first and is placed in one [leather] compartment.&quot;, &quot;2. The scribe must exercise care in writing these sections, for if he wrote a closed section as an open one,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*that is, began the section on a new line where only a space of nine letters should have been left blank.&lt;/i&gt; or wrote an open section as if it were closed, the slip is unfit for use. The first three sections are, all of them, open. The last section, that beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass, if ye will hearken diligently\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is closed.&quot;, &quot;3. He must exercise care in regard to the words that are &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**with or without a &lt;i&gt;Yod&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Vav,&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&lt;/i&gt; that all the four sections should be written as they are in an examined scroll of the Law. For if he wrote a word &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; that should have been written &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; the slip is unfit for use till the superfluous letter has been obliterated. If a word that is &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; has been written &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; the slip is unfit for use and cannot be made good. The following is the list of the words in these four sections that are &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&quot;, &quot;[&lt;i&gt;For paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 (lists of&lt;/i&gt; plene &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; defective &lt;i&gt;words), see the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 121b and 122a&lt;/i&gt;.]&quot;, &quot;6. The &lt;i&gt;Ayin&lt;/i&gt; of Shema and &lt;i&gt;Daleth&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Echad&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 6:4) are to be written in larger type.&quot;, &quot;8. He must pay attention to the \\&quot;crowns\\&quot; (tittles) above the letters. These are like an upright &lt;i&gt;Zayin&lt;/i&gt; and are placed on each letter to which such a crown belongs as written in the scroll of the Law. The following are the letters in the four sections thus ornamented:&quot;, &quot;9. In the first section, there is only one such letter, namely the closed &lt;i&gt;Mem&lt;/i&gt; in Meeyamim which has over it three &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. In the second section, there are five letters, each of them a &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9;&lt;/i&gt; and on each, there are four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. These are the &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Unesanah; the first and the last &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Hikshah; the &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Vayaharog; the &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Yadchah.&quot;, &quot;10. The third section has five such letters. The &lt;i&gt;Koof&lt;/i&gt; in Uvekoomecha has over it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines; the &lt;i&gt;Koof&lt;/i&gt; in Ukeshartam has over it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines; the two letters &lt;i&gt;Teth,&lt;/i&gt; and the letter &lt;i&gt;P\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Letotaphoth have on each of them four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines.&quot;, &quot;11. The fourth section has five such letters. The &lt;i&gt;P\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; of Veasaphta has above it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. The &lt;i&gt;Tav&lt;/i&gt; of Veasaphta has one &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped line. The two letters &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; and the letter &lt;i&gt;P\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Letotaphoth have on each of them four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. Altogether, the letters thus ornamented are sixteen. If the scribe wholly omitted these ornaments, added to them or omitted them over some of the letters, he has not rendered the phylacteries unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;12. If one buys phylacteries from one who is not a recognized expert, he has to examine them. If he bought from him one hundred parchment slips, he examines three slips, either two of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the arm or two slips of those in the phylacteries worn on the arm and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head. If he found all these three correct, a presumption is established in the vendor\&#39;s favour, and all his phylacteries are fit for use and the rest need not be examined. If he bought them however in several bundles, this examination (of three slips) must take place in each bundle, there being a presumption that the several bundles came from different individuals.&quot;, &quot;13. A man who wrote phylacteries with his own hand or purchased them from an expert or, having bought them of a non-expert, examined them and replaced them in their leather containers, need never re-examine them, even after the lapse of many years. As long as the leather container remains sound, the presumption that they are sound holds good. Nor is it apprehended that a letter has been obliterated or perforated. Hillel the Elder was wont to say, \\&quot;These phylacteries belonged to my mother\&#39;s father.\\&quot;&quot;], [&quot;1. There are eight rules for the making of phylacteries; all of them are traditionally ascribed to Moses who received them on Sinai; hence the observance of all of them is indispensable. A variation from any of them renders the phylacteries unfit for use. The rules are as follows: The phylacteries (that is, the external leather containers) must be square; they are to be sewn in such a way as to retain the square shape; their diagonals must be those of a square so that all the angles shall be equal; the leather container of the phylactery for the head shall have the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; embossed on the right and on the left side; each of the slips of parchment on which the sections from the Pentateuch are written is to be wrapt in a cover; this is to be tied with hair, and then the slips are placed in their respective compartments which are sewn up with sinews; a border with a fold open at both ends shall be made of the skin of the base for the strap to pass through freely; the straps shall be black, and have the special knot, that is known to all, in the shape of a &lt;i&gt;Daleth.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;2. How is the phylactery for the head made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length, breadth and height. It is of no consequence however if the height is more than the breadth or less. What is essential is that the length and breadth shall be equal. Three grooves are cut in the block so that it is divided into four parts as in this figure &lt;img src=\\&quot;data:image/jpg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEBLAEsAAD/2wBDAAUDBAQEAwUEBAQFBQUGBwwIBwcHBw8LCwkMEQ8SEhEP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\\nClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUH//Z\\n\\&quot;&gt;. A piece of leather is taken and soaked in water. The wooden block is put in it and the leather is inserted into each groove. While it is still damp, it is crinkled on both sides, to make a shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; with three lines on the right side of the wearer and with four lines on the left side.&quot;, &quot;3. The leather is left on the wood till it dries; it is then slipped off from the wooden block, with the result that it has the shape of four compartments. The prescribed sections of Scripture written on slips of parchment are placed, one in each compartment. A portion of the leather is drawn round and beneath the cube (to form its base). This is sewn up at its four sides. A portion is left in this skin at the base for the strap to pass through as in a loop. This it is which is called the bridge.&quot;, &quot;4. How are the phylacteries for the arm made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length and breadth. It is to be a finger-breadth in height, or a little more or less. The block is covered with wet leather which is left on till it dries. It is then removed, and in the place where the wood had been, a single slip of parchment on which the four prescribed sections of Scripture are written, is inserted. A portion of the leather is drawn round below and is sewn up at its four sides. Of this base a part is left to form a loop for the strap to pass through.&quot;, &quot;5. What is the order in which the sections are placed in the phylactery for the head? The last section, that beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye will hearken diligently\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is placed in the first compartment, to the right of the wearer; the section beginning, \\&quot;Hear O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4) in the compartment adjacent to it; the section beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God will bring thee\\&quot; (Exodus 13:11), next to the one containing the section, \\&quot;Hear O Israel\\&quot;, and the section beginning, \\&quot;Sanctify unto me every first born\\&quot; (Exodus 13:1) in the fourth compartment which would be to the left of the wearer of the phylactery; so that anyone facing the wearer and reading what is before him would read the sections in the right Scriptural order as in the annexed figure. If there&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Sections beginning with verse:&lt;/i&gt; was a deviation from this order, the phylacteries are not fit for use.&quot;, &quot;6. The sections for the phylactery for the arm are written in four columns on one long strip of parchment like a scroll of the Law, and in the order in which they are found in the Pentateuch as in the annexed figure.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**Sections beginning with verse:&lt;/i&gt; If the scribe wrote them on four separate slips and placed them in one compartment, he has done what is required, and need not attach them to each other.&quot;, &quot;7. When he rolls up the parchment slips containing the sections, for the phylacteries worn on the head or on the arm, he rolls them from the end to the beginning so that, if opened, each section can be read from the beginning to the end.&quot;, &quot;8. When the slips are about to be placed in their respective compartments, they are wrapped in a cloth, over which they are fastened with hair. They are then deposited in their compartments. This hair must be that of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species; and may even be taken from animals which are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;***&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;***&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014died of itself or, by extension of meaning, not properly killed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;\\u2020&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;\\u2020&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014torn by wild beast; by extension of meaning, found to have suffered from mortal disease or lesion.&lt;/i&gt; The custom that has come into general use is to fasten the slips with hair taken from calves\&#39; tails.&quot;, &quot;9. The leather receptacles of the phylacteries are only sewn with sinews of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species, and may be taken from animals of such species even if they are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014died of itself or, by extension of meaning, not properly killed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014torn by wild beast; by extension of meaning, found to have suffered from mortal disease or lesion.&lt;/i&gt; The sinews used are those found in the heel of the domestic or wild beast, which are white and tough. They are softened by pounding them with stones or similar substances, till they become like flax. They are spun and twined, and then used for sewing the phylacteries and the sheets of the scrolls of the Law.&quot;, &quot;10. The receptacles are to be sewn in such a way as to preserve the square contour of the base. It is a broadly established rule that on each side, there are to be three stitches, making altogether twelve stitches, whether the phylactery is for the arm or for the head. If the scribe desires to make ten or fourteen stitches, he may do so. The stitch must pass through the leather on both sides.&quot;, &quot;11. The grooves of the phylacteries for the head ought to extend to the base where the stitching is done. If the grooves are recognizable so that the four divisions clearly appear, the phylacteries are fit for use, even though the grooves do not extend to the base. If however the grooves are not recognizable, the phylacteries are unfit for use. Within each groove, above the leather, a thread or cord ought to be passed so as to separate the compartments from each other. The general custom is to draw through each of the three grooves a sinew of the same kind as those used for the stitches.&quot;, &quot;12. How are the thongs fixed? A strip of leather is taken as wide as the length of a barley corn. If wider, it is fit for use. The length of the strap of the phylactery for the head should be sufficient to encircle the head, form the knot and leave enough for the straps on either side to reach to the navel or a little higher. The strap for the phylactery of the arm should be sufficiently long to encircle the forearm, form the knot, extend down to the middle finger, about which it is to be wound three times and then fastened. If the straps exceed in length the foregoing dimensions, they are also fit for use.&quot;, &quot;13. The thong of the phylactery for the head is inserted in the loop open at both ends. It is measured to fit the wearer\&#39;s head, and then tied in a rectangular knot like a &lt;i&gt;Daleth.&lt;/i&gt; This knot, every scholar should learn how to make. It is impossible to teach its form by description; this can only be taught by ocular demonstration. In the case of the phylactery for the arm, the thong is tied in a knot in the shape of a &lt;i&gt;Yod.&lt;/i&gt; The thong of the phylactery for the arm should move freely in the loop, so that the wearer can loosen or tighten it when he puts it on his arm.&quot;, &quot;14. The thongs of the phylacteries, whether for the head or for the arm, must have their exterior surface black. This is a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. But the other side of the thongs, being close to the skin, are fit for use if they are green or white. They must not however be red, for if the thong were inadvertently turned, the color of its lower surface would subject the wearer to ignominy. The lower side of the thongs should not be otherwise in color than the base of the leather case containing the parchment slips. If the latter is green, the former should be green; if white, the former should be white. It is comely if the phylacteries are wholly black, namely, both the case containing the slips of parchment and the thongs.&quot;, &quot;15. The leather which forms the receptacles of the phylacteries and its thongs is to be made from the hide of a domestic or wild quadruped or skin of a fowl that belongs to the clean species, and may even be taken from those of these species that are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Terefah.&lt;/i&gt; If they were made of the skin or hide of unclean species, or if the phylacteries were covered with gold, the phylacteries are unfit for use. The leather for the thongs must be expressly tanned for their intended purpose to be thongs of phylacteries. The leather which forms the receptacles for the phylacteries need not be tanned. Even if it consists of raw hide it is fit for use. Many places have the custom to make them of raw hide.&quot;, &quot;16. The receptacles of the phylacteries may not be prepared by any one but an Israelite; for the making of these is like the writing of the prescribed sections because of the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; which is embossed on the phylactery for the head, as we have already stated. Hence, if a non-Israelite made or sewed the phylacteries, they are unfit for use. So too, whoever is disqualified from writing the prescribed sections for the phylacteries may not prepare them.&quot;, &quot;17. The phylactery for the head may not be transformed into a phylactery for the arm, but the latter may be changed into the former; on the principle that an object may not be degraded from a higher to a lower sacred use. So too, the thong of the phylactery for the head may not be transferred to a phylactery for the arm. This rule only applies to phylacteries that had been worn. But with regard to phylacteries for the head that no one had ever worn, if it is desired to transform them into phylacteries for the arm, this may be done. How is this effected? It is covered with leather so that it appears as one receptacle. The phylactery may then be bound on the arm.&quot;, &quot;18. In case the stitches of the phylacteries are broken, they become unfit for use if there are two broken stitches adjacent to each other, or three not adjacent. This rule applies to old phylacteries. New phylacteries are fit for use as long as they keep their surface unimpaired. The following would be called new. If, at the place where the stitches have given way, part of the leather is held in the hand so that the phylactery is suspended, and the leather is strong enough not to be further torn, such phylacteries would be regarded as new. If however the leather is not strong enough to bear the weight of the phylacteries so suspended, but would tear, such phylacteries are regarded as old.&quot;, &quot;19. A thong that has become broken is not to be tied together nor sewn up; but it is to be removed, put away, and replaced by a new thong. The parts of the broken thong are unfit for use unless the length and breadth of the part is of the prescribed dimension or larger. Care should always be taken that the external surface of the thongs should be above, when the phylacteries are bound on the hand or round the head. End of the chapter.&quot;], [&quot;1. Where is the phylactery of the head placed? It is placed on that part of the crown of the head, where the hair adjacent to the forehead ends, and this is the place where an infant\&#39;s brain pulsates (the fontanelle). The phylactery needs to be adjusted so that it lies in the centre of the forehead, in a line with the point between the eyes. The knot should be at the top of the back of the neck, which is the end of the skull.&quot;, &quot;2. The phylactery of the hand is bound on the left arm over the biceps muscle which is the flesh that stands out on the upper arm that is intermediate between the shoulder-blade and forearm, so that when the upper arm is held close to the ribs, the phylactery will be opposite the heart and thus the precept will be fulfilled, \\&quot;And these words \\u2026 shall be upon thine heart\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:6).&quot;, &quot;3. To lay the phylactery of the hand on the palm or that of the head on the forehead is the practice of the Sadducees. He who makes the phylactery round like a nut is not fulfilling the precept in any way. A left-handed person lays the phylactery on his right arm, used by him as his left. If one is ambidextrous, he lays it on his left arm, which is the same as the left arm of any other person. The places where the phylacteries are respectively bound and laid are known by tradition.&quot;, &quot;4. The lack of a phylactery for the head does not preclude one from putting on that of the hand, nor does the lack of a phylactery of the hand preclude one from putting on that for the head. Each is a duty separate and independent. What blessings are recited? For the phylactery of the head, the formula is as follows: \\&quot;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and given us a command concerning the precept of phylacteries\\&quot;. For that of the hand, the form is as follows: \\&quot;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to lay the phylacteries\\&quot;.&quot;, &quot;5. This rule applies to the case where a person puts on one phylactery only. But when one lays both phylacteries, he recites one blessing, namely, the form, \\&quot;And hast commanded us to lay the phylacteries\\&quot;, binds the phylactery on his arm, and then puts on that for the head. When they are removed, that on the head is removed first, and afterwards that on the arm.&quot;, &quot;6. When a person has recited the blessing, \\&quot;Who hast commanded us to lay phylacteries\\&quot;, and bound the phylactery on his arm, he is forbidden to converse, even to the extent of acknowledging his master\&#39;s greeting, till he has put on the phylactery of the head. If he conversed he has committed a transgression; and when putting on the phylactery for the head, he must recite another blessing, viz: the form, \\&quot;Who hast given us a command concerning the precept of the phylacteries\\&quot;, and then he puts on the phylactery for the head.&quot;, &quot;7. On each occasion when one puts on phylacteries, the blessing is recited, even if they are removed and put on again several times in the day. It is a universal rule with regard to religious precepts that the appropriate blessings are recited prior to their performance. Hence too, the blessing for the phylactery of the hand has to be recited after it is placed on the biceps muscle before the thong is tightened, for the fastening constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.&quot;, &quot;8. When a person removes his phylacteries, and puts them in a bag, he should not place the phylactery of the hand beneath and that for the head above it, because when he will again have occasion to put them on, he will come into contact with the phylactery of the head first, will thus be under the necessity of putting it down and take out the phylactery of the hand, the former not being put on before the latter. It is forbidden to leave a precept and pass on to the fulfillment of another religious duty, the rule being that the duty that first presents itself should first engage our attention. Hence, the phylactery for the hand should be placed above so that one may come into contact with it first, and the phylacteries be put on in the right order.&quot;, &quot;9. A bag expressly intended to contain phylacteries and into which these have been placed, becomes consecrated and may not be put to secular use. If the bag was intended for this express purpose of containing phylacteries but had never contained them, or if phylacteries had been casually placed in a bag not set aside for that use, it does not become sacred, and continues to be a secular object as it had been hitherto. Phylacteries may not be suspended by their thong or by the part which contains the scriptural section. But the bag containing the phylacteries may be suspended.&quot;, &quot;10. The proper time for putting on phylacteries is when it is day and not when it is night, for it is said, \\&quot;Day by day\\&quot;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Usually rendered, \\u201cfrom year to year\\u201d, referring to observance of the feast of Passover.&lt;/i&gt; (Exodus 13:10). \\&quot;The ordinance\\&quot; mentioned in this verse refers to the precept of phylacteries. So it is said, \\&quot;And it shall be for a sign\\&quot;, while Sabbaths and festivals are them-also, Sabbaths and festivals are not seasons for putting on phylacteries, for selves a sign. When is the proper time in the day to put on phylacteries? At the hour when a person can see his neighbour at a distance of four cubits and recognize him. The period extends till sunset.&quot;, &quot;11. A person who put on phylacteries before sunset, is permitted when it becomes dusk, to continue to wear them, even throughout the night. The multitude however is not to be so taught. Everyone should be instructed not to wear phylacteries at night, but to remove them at sunset. Whoever deliberately puts on phylacteries after sunset, violates a prohibition, for it is said, \\&quot;And thou shalt keep this ordinance in its season, day by day\\&quot; (Exodus 13:10).&quot;, &quot;12. If the sun sets while a man with the phylacteries on his head was on the road, he places his hand upon the phylactery till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If Sabbath or a festival arrived while he was sitting in the house of study, with the phylactery on his head, he places his hand upon it till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If there is a house near the City Wall,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*the house of study was outside the town.&lt;/i&gt; where the phylacteries could be safely left, he should leave them there. If he did not remove them after sunset, because he had no place where they would be safe, and he kept them on for the sake of security, his conduct is lawful.&quot;, &quot;13. One who is exempt from reading the &lt;i&gt;Shema&lt;/i&gt; is exempt from putting on phylacteries. If a child less than thirteen years of age knows how to take care of his phylacteries, his father purchases a set for him, so as to train him in the practice of religious precepts. Those who suffer intestinal troubles or have difficulty in controlling their sphincters are exempt from the obligation of putting on phylacteries. All who are ritually unclean are under the same obligation of putting on phylacteries as those who are ritually clean. One, who is in pain or whose mind is not calm and composed is exempt from the duty of putting on phylacteries; for the wearer must not allow his consciousness of them to wander. Priests while engaged in the temple service, Levites during the recital of hymns in their appointed places, Israelites while they are in the Sanctuary, are exempt from the duties of reciting the prayers and putting on phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;14. As long as one is wearing phylacteries, he should frequently touch them with his fingers, so as not to lose consciousness of them for a single moment. For their degree of sanctity is higher than that of the golden plate which the High Priest wore on his forehead. On the latter, the name of God was engraved once only, while the phylactery for the head contains the tetragrammaton twenty-one times, and the phylactery for the arm, an equal number of times.&quot;, &quot;15. A requisite in wearing phylacteries is physical cleanliness. One should take care that no flatus escapes him while he has them on. Hence, he may not, while wearing them, indulge in regular sleep or even doze. But if they are covered with a cloth, he may doze, even while wearing them. How so? He places his head between his knees and dozes in a sitting posture. If his phylacteries were folded and held in his hand, the holder may even sleep in the regular way.&quot;, &quot;16. No meal, unless it be of a casual character, may be eaten, while one wears phylacteries (without previous preparation). Before proceeding to a regular meal, he removes them, places them on the table, washes his hands, puts them on again, recites the blessing for food while he has them on.&quot;, &quot;17. If one feels a call of nature while wearing phylacteries, he is not to deposit them, before entering the lavatory, in the crevices that open towards the public thoroughfare, lest passers-by may take them. How should he act? Even if he needs to relieve the bladder while he is at a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, he should remove the phylacteries, roll them up in his garment, as a scroll is rolled up, grasp them in his right hand opposite his heart, taking care that not a thong projects outside his hand as much as a hand breadth; then he enters, relieves himself, and, after having left, goes away to a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, and puts on his phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;18. This rule only applies to the case of a permanent lavatory. But one may not enter an extemporized lavatory with phylacteries even rolled up. They should be removed and given to another person for safe keeping.&quot;, &quot;19. If one wearing phylacteries needed to go to the lavatory at eventide when there would be no more time to put them on again, he should not enter with the phylacteries rolled up in his garment, even to relieve his bladder, if the lavatory is a permanent one. How should he act? He should remove the phylacteries, place them in their bag which must be at least a hand breadth long, or even in a smaller bag provided it is not specially assigned as a receptable for phylacteries. This he keeps in his hand and enters. Thus, too, at night time, if he needs to visit the lavatory, he may put the phylacteries in a bag which he keeps in his hand when entering.&quot;, &quot;20. Translation omitted.&quot;, &quot;21. Translation omitted.&quot;, &quot;22. One is permitted to put on phylacteries in that portion of a bathhouse where all are attired. In that portion where some are in their attire while others are nude, the phylacteries which one wears need not be removed, but they may not be put on. Where all are nude, the phylacteries must be removed, and needless to add, they may not be put on.&quot;, &quot;23. A person should not walk in a cemetery with phylacteries on his head. When he is within a distance of four cubits from a corpse or a grave, the phylacteries are to be removed till he has passed on to a distance outside four cubits. Phylacteries must not be put on before one is decently covered and has put on his garments. If a person is carrying a burden on his head, he must remove the phylactery from his head, and may not put it on till he has removed the burden. Even a kerchief [alone] may not be put upon the head when one is wearing phylacteries. But he puts his cap over the phylactery.&quot;, &quot;24. In a room where there are phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, marital intercourse may not take place, till these have been taken out, or placed in a receptacle which itself is enclosed in another receptacle not assigned to the use of phylacteries or a scroll of the Law. If the latter receptacle has been so assigned, and even if there be ten such receptacles, they are all regarded as one receptacle. If he placed the sacred articles in two receptacles, one within the other, they may be put for security under his pillow between the bolster and the coverlid\\u2014not however exactly beneath his head. This may be done even if his wife shares his couch.&quot;, &quot;25. The sanctity of phylacteries is a high degree of sanctity. As long as phylacteries are on a man\&#39;s head and arm, he is humble and God-fearing, is not drawn into frivolity and idle talk, does not dwell on evil thoughts but occupies his mind with thoughts of truth and righteousness. A man should therefore endeavour to wear phylacteries the whole day, this being the right way of fulfilling the precept. It is said of &lt;i&gt;Rav,&lt;/i&gt; the disciple of our Sainted Teacher (R. Judah, the Prince), that throughout his life no one saw him, without Torah, Tzitzis (fringes on his garments) or phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;26. Although the proper mode of fulfilling the precept is to wear phylacteries the whole day, it is especially a duty to do so during the recital of prayers. The sages say, \\&quot;Whoever reads the &lt;i&gt;Shema&lt;/i&gt; without wearing phylacteries is regarded as testifying falsely in his own person.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*He recites the Commandment to wear &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and does not fulfill it.&lt;/i&gt; Whoever does not wear phylacteries at all violates eight affirmative precepts, since in each of the four sections, the command is set forth to lay phylacteries on the head and on the arm. Whoever wears phylacteries regularly will be blessed with longevity, as it is said, \&#39;The Lord is upon them: they shall live\&#39;\\&quot; (Isaiah 38:16).&quot;], [&quot;1. How is the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**Sections of Scripture placed on doorposts.&lt;/i&gt; written? Two sections of the Pentateuch, those beginning, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4) and, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) are written in a single column on one slip of parchment. A space of half a nail\&#39;s breadth is left as a margin above and below the column. If the Pentateuchal sections were written in two or three columns, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use. They must not however be written in the shape of a tail (broad at the top line and gradually narrowing to a point), or of a circle, or of a tent (narrow at the top and broadening to the base). A &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; written in any of these forms is unfit for use. If the text was written out of order, for example, if the second section was in front of the first, it is unfit for use. If it was written on two slips of parchment, even though these were sewn together, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use. A Scroll of the Law that has become worn out or phylacteries that are worn out may not be used for a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Nor may margins cut off from a scroll of the Law be so used; for anything dedicated to a sacred purpose may not be degraded from a higher to a lower degree of sacredness.&quot;, &quot;2. It is a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (an act of piety) to separate the section beginning, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; from that beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass\\&quot; by a \\&quot;closed\\&quot; space (blank of nine letters). If the division between the two sections was an \\&quot;open\\&quot; one (the second section beginning a new line), the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use, as, in the Pentateuch, the second section does not immediately follow the first. Special heed should be paid to the tittles in the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; The following are the tittles which are made in the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;3. In the first section, there are seven letters, each of which should have above it three upright lines in the shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Zain.&lt;/i&gt; They are the &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ayin&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Shema; Nun&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nafshecha;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Totafoth.&lt;/i&gt; The second section has six letters, each of which should have above it three &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. They are the &lt;i&gt;Gimel&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Degancha;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Totafoth;&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;Tzadi&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Ha-aretz.&lt;/i&gt; If the tittles were omitted or if they are more or less than those specified, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; has not been rendered unfit for use. But if it was written without the lines having been ruled, or if the scribe paid no heed to &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; letters, or if he added in the text even a single letter, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;4. It is a universal custom to write the word &lt;i&gt;Shaddai&lt;/i&gt; (Almighty) on the other side of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; opposite the blank space between the two sections. As this word is written on the outside, the practice is unobjectionable. They, however, who write names of angels, holy names, a Biblical text or inscriptions usual on seals, within the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; are among those who have no portion in the world to come. For these fools not only fail to fulfill the commandment but they treat an important precept that expresses the Unity of God, the love of Him, and His worship, as if it were an amulet to promote their own personal interests; for, according to their foolish minds, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is something that will secure for them advantage in the vanities of the world.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*A reproof to those who sell Mezuzoth to be worn as amulets !&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;5. It is a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (act of piety) to write &lt;i&gt;Al Ha-aretz&lt;/i&gt; (the last two words) on the last line, either at the beginning or in the middle of the line. All the scribes follow the custom of writing the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; in twenty-two lines, and (the last two words) &lt;i&gt;Al Ha-aretz&lt;/i&gt; at the commencement of the last line. The following are the words in order, which begin each of the lines: (See the Hebrew text on the corresponding right-hand side, page 127b.)&quot;, &quot;6. When the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is folded, it is rolled up from the end of the line to the beginning, so that anyone opening it is able to read it from the beginning to the end of the line. After it has been rolled up, it is placed in a cylinder of reed, wood or other material, which is attached to the doorpost with a nail; or else a cavity is hollowed out in the doorpost, into which the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is inserted.&quot;, &quot;7. Before one affixes it to the doorpost, he recites the blessing, \\&quot;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us to affix the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah\\&quot;.&lt;/i&gt; No blessing is recited at the time when it is written, because the affixing of it constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.&quot;, &quot;8. If one suspended it on a staff, it is unfit, for this is not affixing it (to the doorpost). If one placed it behind the door, he has not fulfilled the precept. If he perforated the door and forced the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; into it like a nail, as a bolt is inserted in the staple-ring, it is unfit. If it was placed in a hollow of the doorpost at a depth of a hand-breadth, it is unfit. If one cut a stick, put a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on it, attached this stick to other sticks and made of them all a doorpost, it is unfit, because the affixing of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; preceded the erection of the doorpost.&quot;, &quot;9. The &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; of a private dwelling is examined once every seven years; that attached to a public building twice in the Jubilee (fifty years). The object is to ascertain whether a letter has been torn away or obliterated; because owing to the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; being affixed to walls, it is liable to decay.&quot;, &quot;10. The fulfillment of the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is incumbent upon all Israelites, including women and slaves (of Israelites). Children under the age of thirteen years are trained to affix the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; to their rooms. One who rents a dwelling outside the Holy Land, or lodges at an inn in the Holy Land is exempt from the obligation of affixing a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; for a period of thirty days after beginning his occupancy. But if one rents a home in the Holy Land, the duty of affixing a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; devolves immediately.&quot;, &quot;11. If one lets a dwelling to another person, the duty devolves upon the lessee to bring a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; and attach it, even if he has to pay for doing so, for the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is the personal obligation of the occupant and not an obligation attaching to the structure. When he surrenders possession, he must not, on quitting the premises, remove the Mezuzah. But if the owner is a non-Israelite, the Jewish tenant, when leaving, takes it away.&quot;], [&quot;1. There are ten conditions which must exist in a dwelling, to put the occupant under an obligation to affix a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If one of these is absent, he is exempt. These are as follows: The dwelling must have a superficial area of four cubits by four cubits or more; it must have two door-posts, a lintel, a roof and doors; the entrance should be ten hand-breadths high or more; it must be a secular (not a sacred) structure; it must have been erected for human occupancy, for honored use (not a lavatory), and built for permanent habitation.&quot;, &quot;2. A dwelling, the superficial area of which is less than four cubits by four cubits does not require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If its area is equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits, even if it is circular in shape or has five angles, or, needless to add, if its length is greater than its breadth, it requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; provided that it covers an area equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits.&quot;, &quot;3. A porch, that is a place with three walls and a roof, even though it has two uprights on the fourth side does not need a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; the uprights serving to support the roof and not as doorposts. Thus too, a roof without walls that rests on pillars on either side, even if it presents the appearance of a dwelling is exempt from the obligation of having a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; on account of its having no doorposts\\u2014the pillars having been erected to support the roof.&quot;, &quot;4. A dwelling with posts on either side (of the door), and in the place of the lintel an arch in the shape of a bow, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; provided that the posts are ten hand-breadths high or more. If they are not ten hand-breadths high, there is no such obligation, as the dwelling has no lintel.&quot;, &quot;5. A dwelling without a roof does not require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Where part of it is covered with a roof and part uncovered, it seems to me that if the portion over the entrance is roofed, the structure requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; After the doors are set up, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is affixed.&quot;, &quot;6. The Temple Mount, its chambers and courts, synagogues and houses of study which have no residences are exempt, because they are sacred. A village synagogue in which transients lodge requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; So too, a city synagogue which has a dwelling house attached to it, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; None of the Temple entrances had a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; except the Gate of Nikanor, and the gate within that gate, and the entrance to the Chamber of Parhedrin, because this chamber was the High Priest\&#39;s residence during his seven days of seclusion (prior to the Day of Atonement).&quot;, &quot;7. A hayloft, a cattle-shed, a wood store and a barn are exempted from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because of the phrase, \\&quot;thy house\\&quot; (in the text \\&quot;thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house\\&quot;), which means a dwelling assigned to thy use and excludes the aforementioned and similar classes of buildings. Hence, a cattle-shed, where women stay adorning themselves, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because it also serves as a human habitation. A lodge or porch\\u2014either rectangular or circular\\u2014leading to a garden, a garden and a sheepfold are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because they are not constructed to serve as residences. If dwellings requiring a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; open to these places, the latter must also have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;8. Hence, entrances, whether leading to courtyards or to passages, and gates of districts or cities, must each have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because dwellings which require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; open on to them. Even where ten rooms open one to the other, each requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; just as the innermost room requires it. This is the reason for the rule that a gate opening from the garden to a courtyard requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;9. A privy, bath-house, ritual bath-house, tannery and similar places are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; because they are not erected to serve as dwellings for honored use. The tabernacle for the feast of Tabernacles, and a room in a ship are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; because they are not made for permanent occupancy. Of two potter\&#39;s booths, one leading to the other, the exterior is exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because it is not permanent. Shops in market places are exempt, because they are not intended to be used as residences.&quot;, &quot;10. A dwelling with several doors, although only one is regularly used for coming in and going out, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; affixed to each door. A small door between a dwelling (below) and the attic needs a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Every room in a dwelling, even a room within a room, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; at the entrance of the inner chamber, of the outer chamber and of the house, for they all serve the purpose of residence and are permanent.&quot;, &quot;11. A door between a house of study or synagogue and a private house, if used habitually for entering and leaving, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If a door is between two dwellings, the position of the hinge determines the side on which the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is to be fixed. The side on which the hinge is visible is regarded as the dwelling in reference to which the position of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is decided.&quot;, &quot;12. Where is the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; to be fixed? Within the width of the doorpost, a hand-breadth from the external edge at a height of a third of the elevation of the entrance, counting from the top. If placed higher it is fit in position, provided that it is a hand-breadth lower than the lintel. It should be fixed on the right side of one entering; if placed on the left side, it is unfit for use. A house owned by partners requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;13. A person should pay heed to the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah;&lt;/i&gt; for it is an obligation perpetually binding upon all. Whenever one enters or leaves a home with the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on the doorpost, he will be confronted with the Declaration of God\&#39;s Unity, blessed be His holy name; and will remember the love due to God, and will be aroused from his slumbers and his foolish absorption in temporal vanities. He will realize that nothing endures to all eternity save knowledge of the Ruler of the Universe. This thought will immediately restore him to his right senses and he will walk in the paths of righteousness. Our ancient teachers said: He who has phylacteries on his head and arm, fringes on his garment and a Mezuzah on his door may be presumed not to sin, for he has many monitors\\u2014angels that save him from sinning, as it is said, (Psalms 34:8) \\&quot;The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them\\&quot;.&quot;], [&quot;1. It is an affirmative precept binding upon every individual Israelite to write a scroll of the Law for his own use, as it is said, \\&quot;Now therefore write ye this Song for you\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:19). As the Torah is not written in separate sections, this text means, \\&quot;Write for yourselves the Torah in which this Song is contained.\\&quot; Even if one\&#39;s ancestors have left a person a scroll, it is a religious duty to write a scroll at his own expense. If he wrote it with his own hand, it is accounted to him as if he had received it from Sinai. If one does not know how to write a scroll, he should get others to write it for him. He who corrects a scroll, even a single letter of it, is regarded as if he had written it completely.&quot;, &quot;2. A king has the duty of writing for himself another scroll of the Law, in his capacity as sovereign, in addition to the scroll which he owns in his private capacity, as it is said, \\&quot;And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law, etc.\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:18). This copy is corrected by comparison with a scroll kept in the temple court, and under the authority of the Supreme Judicature. The scroll which the king had possessed when he was a private individual, he places in his archives. The one that he wrote or had written for him when he became king, should always be with him. If he goes to war, the scroll is to be with him. When he enters his home, it is to be with him. When he hears a cause (tries a case) it is to be with him. When he sits down to a meal, it is to be placed before him, as it is said, \\&quot;And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:19).&quot;, &quot;3. If he possessed no scroll before he came to the throne, he has to write, after his accession, two scrolls of the law, one of which he places in his archives, while the other is to be always with him. It must never be away from him, except at night, or when he goes to the bath or the lavatory or lies down on his couch to sleep.&quot;, &quot;4. A scroll of the Law that has been written without having been ruled, or that has been written partly on parchment made of whole hide and partly on that made of the inner half of split hide is unfit for use. It must be entirely written either on the former or on the latter. How is a scroll of the law to be written? The scribe is to use the correct script and it should also be exceedingly fine. Between one word and another, he is to leave the space of a small letter; between one letter and another (in the same word) the space of a hair\&#39;s breadth; between one line and the next the space of a line. The length of each line is to be thirty letters, wide enough to write the word Le-Mi-Sh-Pe-Ch-O-S-E-Che-M&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Ten consonant letters printed here in capital letters. See also below.&lt;/i&gt; three times. This is to be the width of each column. No line shall be shorter, so that the column shall not look like an epistle. Nor should any line be wider so that the reader\&#39;s eyes should not have to wander across the sheet.&quot;, &quot;5. He should not diminish the size of the characters in order to leave a space between one paragraph and another. When he comes (at the end of a line) to a word of five letters, he must not write two within the column and three outside the column; but he is to write three letters within the column and two outside the column. If there is not enough space left at the end of the line to write three letters, he is to leave it blank and begin at the commencement of the next line.&quot;, &quot;6. If at the end of a line, he has a word of two letters to write, he may not place it between the columns (that is, outside the column) but he writes it at the beginning of the next line. If, before the line is filled up, he has a word of ten letters, more or less, to write and there is not enough space left on the line to write it all within the column, if he is able to write half the word within the column and half outside the column, he may do so. If he cannot do this, he leaves the space blank and writes the word at the beginning of the next line.&quot;, &quot;7. Between each book and the next, he leaves a space of four lines, no more and no less, blank without any writing, and starts the next book at the beginning of the fifth line. When completing the Torah, he is to finish it in the middle of the line at the end of the column. If several lines of the column would be left, he shortens the lines, so as to begin at the beginning of the last line of the column and not complete it, and also so plans the lines that the final words &lt;i&gt;Le-\\u00e9n\\u00e9 Chol Yisrael&lt;/i&gt; (\\&quot;in the sight of all Israel\\&quot;) shall be in the middle of the line at the end of the column.&quot;, &quot;8. He should pay careful attention to the letters that are written large or small, to the letters that are punctuated with dots above them, to the letters that are written differently to the others, such as the letter P\\u00e9 and the letters that are curved, in the way the scribes have carried on the tradition. He is to pay attention to the tittles&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*lines over each of the letters &lt;i&gt;Shin, Ayin, Teth, Nuen, Zayin, Gimel, Tzadi&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; and the number of them in each case\\u2014one letter having above it a single tittle, another having seven tittles. All the tittles have the shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; and are to be thin as a hair.&quot;, &quot;9. All these provisoes are only stated in order that the duty of writing a scroll shall be observed in the most perfect way. If, however the scribe made changes in the method here set forth, was not careful in regard to the tittles, writing however all the letters correctly, or if he wrote the lines close together or far apart, extended the lines or shortened them\\u2014since he did not join any letter to another, omit aught or add aught, mar the form of any letter, nor make any variation in regard to which paragraphs should be open and which closed, the scroll is fit for use.&quot;, &quot;10. There are other rules mentioned in the Talmud which the scribes observe as a tradition handed down from one to another. They are as follows: The number of lines in each column shall not be less than forty-eight and not more than sixty; the blank spaces between one section and another shall be such that nine letters, e.g., A She R, A She R, A She R, can be written in it. The five lines preceding the Song at the Red Sea (Exodus 14:28, 29, 30, 30, 31) shall begin respectively with the words &lt;i&gt;Habaim, Bayabashah, Hashem, Mes, Bemitzraim.&lt;/i&gt; The five lines after it shall begin respectively with the words &lt;i&gt;Vatikach, Achareha, Sus, Vayetz\\u00eb\\u00fc, Vayav\\u00f6\\u00fc&lt;/i&gt; (Exodus 15:20, 20, 21, 22, 23). The six lines before the Song of Moses beginning &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) shall respectively commence with the words &lt;i&gt;Veaeedah, Achar\\u00e9, Haderech, Beacharith, Lehacheeso, Kehal&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 31:28, 29, 29, 29, 29, 30); and the five lines after the Song of Moses shall begin with the words &lt;i&gt;Vayabo, Ledabber, Asher, Hazoth, Asher&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:44, 45, 46, 46, 47). All these points of observance are to enable us to fulfill the duty in the best way. Variations in these particulars do not render the scroll unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;11. But if the scribe wrote &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; a word that should be &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or vice versa; or a word traditionally pronounced differently to the way it is written, according to the traditional pronunciation, for example, if he wrote &lt;i&gt;Yishkevenoh&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Yishgelenoh,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Oovatechorim&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Oova-apolim,&lt;/i&gt; etc.; or if he wrote an \\&quot;open\\&quot; section as if it were a closed section or vice versa; or if he wrote one of the Songs like the ordinary prose text, or an ordinary section in the form of one of the Songs, the scroll is unfit for use as a scroll of the Law. It has not the sacredness of a scroll of the Law, but is like any one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught.&quot;, &quot;12. A scroll of the Law, which has not been examined for correctness may not be kept longer than thirty days. It must either be corrected or segregated.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*put away and not be used.&lt;/i&gt; A scroll of the Law which has three errors in each column should be corrected. If there are four, it must be put away. If the greater portion has been found to be correct, and the remainder has four errors in each column, but there is even one column in this erroneous portion with less than four errors, corrections could be made.&quot;, &quot;13. This rule only applies to cases where the scribe wrote &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; words that should be written &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; so that he would be under the necessity of inserting the letters that he forgot between the lines. But if he wrote &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; words that are &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; even if every column contains several errors, he corrects them, as he only erases and does not have to insert letters between the lines.&quot;, &quot;14. It is permitted to write the Pentateuch, each book in a separate scroll. These scrolls have not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law that is complete. One may not however write a scroll containing some sections. Such a scroll may not be written for a child\&#39;s instruction. This is permitted, however, where there is the intention to complete the remainder of the book. If one wrote such a scroll with three words on each line, this is permitted.&quot;, &quot;15. The Pentateuch, the Prophets and the Hagiography may be put together in one volume. In such a case, a space of four lines is left blank between each book of the Pentateuch and the next; a space of three lines between each of the major Prophets and the next; and a space of three lines between each of the twelve minor prophets and the next, so that he can, if he wishes, separate any book. The order of the prophetical books is as follows: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah, the Twelve Minor Prophets. The order of the books of the Hagiography is: Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel, Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.&quot;, &quot;16. None of The Holy Scriptures may be written except on ruled lines, even if they are written on paper: Three words of Scripture may be written without ruling the line, but to write more is forbidden. A volume containing the Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiography has not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, but of a single book of the Pentateuch. The scroll which contains more than the entire Pentateuch is in the same class as that which contains less than the entire Pentateuch, on the principle that excess is similar to deficiency.&quot;], [&quot;1. The &lt;i&gt;open&lt;/i&gt; section has two forms. If the previous section ended in the middle of a line, the scribe leaves the remainder of the line blank and commences the open section at the beginning of the next line. This only applies to the case where, after the conclusion of the previous section, there is left sufficient space on the line to write nine letters. But if the space left is less, or if the previous section was completed at the end of the line, the next line must be left blank, and the open section is begun at the commencement of the third line.&quot;, &quot;2. A &lt;i&gt;closed&lt;/i&gt; section has three forms. If the previous section ended within the line, the scribe leaves a blank space for the required dimension (enough to write nine letters) and begins the closed section at the end of the line, provided that there is a blank space between it and the preceding section. If the completion of the previous section did not leave space for the blank of the required breadth and for writing (at least) one word at the end of the line, the scribe should leave the remainder of the line blank, leave a little space at the beginning of the next line blank, and begin the closed section within the line. If the previous section ended at the close of the line, he leaves a blank space of the required breadth (nine letters), at the beginning of the next line, and begins to write the closed section within the line. Hence, you may say that an open section always begins within the line.&quot;, &quot;3. A scroll which is inaccurate in regard to words that are written &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; can be made good by being corrected, as already explained. But if the scribe made a mistake in the spacing between the sections, and wrote an open section as if it were a closed section, or a closed section as if it were an open section or left a space where a section does not end, or continued writing without leaving a space where a section ends, or deviated from the form in which the Songs are written, in all these cases, the Scroll is unfit for use and there is no remedy except to remove the entire column in which the mistake occurs.&quot;, &quot;4. As in all the scrolls I have seen, I noticed serious incorrectness in these regards, while authorities on the Massorah, who write treatises and compilations with the aim of pointing out the sections that are closed and those that are open, differ according to the variations in the scrolls on which they rely, I deemed it fit to write here a list of the sections which are closed and those which are open, as also the forms in which the Songs of the Pentateuch are written so that all the scrolls may be corrected from, and compared with them. The copy on which I relied is the well-known Egyptian codex which contains the twenty-four books of the Scriptures and which had been in Jerusalem for several years\\u2014used as the standard text for the examination of scrolls. Everyone relied upon it because it had been examined by Ben Asher who closely studied it for many years and examined it again whenever it was being copied. This codex was the text on which I relied in the scroll of the Law that I wrote according to the rules.&quot;, &quot;(Here follow lists of open and closed sections which are in the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 131b to 136b.)&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF GENESIS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 43; of closed sections 48; total 91.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF EXODUS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 69; of closed sections, 95; total 164.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 52; of closed sections, 46; total 98.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF NUMBERS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 92; of closed sections, 66; total 158.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections of this book is 34; of closed sections, 124, total 158. The number of open sections in the entire Pentateuch is 290; of the closed sections, 379; total 669.&quot;, &quot;The form of the Song &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43). Every line has a blank space in the middle, like that preceding a closed section. Hence, every line is divided into two parts. The song is written in 70 lines. The words at the beginning of the lines are as follows:&quot;, &quot;(See the Hebrew text on the right hand side page 136a)&quot;, &quot;All these are the words at the beginning of the lines. And the following are the words at the beginning of the latter half of the line which are in the middle of the column.&quot;, &quot;(See the Hebrew text on the right hand pages 136a and 136b)&quot;, &quot;The Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15:1-19) is written in thirty lines, the first line in the ordinary way; the other lines, one with a blank space in the middle, the next with blank spaces in two places, so that the line is divided into three parts and so a blank space corresponds to writing (above and below it) and vice versa as follows.&quot;, &quot;See the Hebrew text on the right-hand side 136a, 136b and 137a as it should be written in the scroll. The English pages should be blank.&quot;, &quot;Throughout the Torah, in the Songs as well as in the rest of the text, the scribe should aim to write all the letters of each word close together, taking care that no letter should be joined to another, and that no letter should be so far away from the next as to make the word seem two words. The interval between the letters in one word should be a hairbreadth. If the scribe wrote one letter so far apart from the other that it would appear to a child who is not familiar with the text like two words, the scroll is unfit for use till he makes the correction.&quot;], [&quot;1. The length of a scroll of the Law should not exceed the circumference, nor should the circumference exceed the length. What is a suitable length? Where parchment of a whole hide is used, six hand-breadths, that is twenty-four finger-breadths taking the thumb as the standard. Where the parchment of the external half of the hide is used, the length may be more or less than this dimension, provided only that the length is equal to the circumference. So also in the case of parchment of a whole hide, if the scribe made the length less than six hand-breadths and wrote in a small hand or longer than six handbreadths and spread out the writing so that the length of the column is equal to the circumference\\u2014this too is correct.&quot;, &quot;2. The extent of the lower margin is four finger-breadths; of the upper margin, three finger-breadths; between one column and another, two finger-breadths. Hence, on the right and left of every sheet of parchment, the scribe has to leave a margin a finger-breadth wide and enough beside for sewing; so that, when the sheets are sewn together, there will be throughout the scroll a blank space of two finger-breadths between the columns. The scribe must leave in addition enough margin at the beginning and end of the scroll to fold a blank column round the rollers. All these dimensions are to be observed in order to fulfill the precept properly. But if the scribe exceeded or fell short of them, he does not render the scroll unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;3. How shall one proceed so that the length of the scroll shall turn out equal to its circumference. The parchment sheets are made evenly rectangular; each sheet being six handbreadths wide, all of the same dimensions. They are rolled evenly into one bundle tightly rolled up. And skins are added and tightly rolled till the circumference is six handbreadths, which is the width of the sheets. This is measured with a thread of wool which is placed round the bundle.&quot;, &quot;4. The scribe then fashions a straight ruler, forty or fifty finger-breadths long; one of these finger-breadths, he marks in two, three and four equal parts so as to be able to measure off a half, a third and a quarter of a finger-breadth and similar fractions. With this, he measures each sheet, so as to ascertain the number of finger-breadths it contains and so determine how many finger-breadths there are in the entire bundle.&quot;, &quot;5. He then takes two or three other sheets of parchment, to test the size of the characters, and writes on them one column. The length of a column of writing is obviously seventeen finger-breadths as a margin must be left, of three finger-breadths above and four finger-breadths below. The width of the column will depend on the handwriting, whether it is large or small. So also, the number of lines will vary according to the handwriting, as between each line and the next, the space of a line must be left.&quot;, &quot;6. Having written the column which he uses as a test as he pleases, he measures its breadth by means of the finger-breadths of the ruler, and adds two finger-breadths for the margin between column and column. He then calculates how many columns of such writing would fill the sheets in the bundle he had made up. Having ascertained the total number of columns, he will then see how much of the entire Pentateuch is in the column which he wrote as a test. He will make the estimate with the aid of the scroll which serves him as a copy, and calculate accordingly. If the number of columns of the kind of writing which he wrote is sufficient for the whole Torah\\u2014well and good. If the calculation showed that there are more columns than are required for the whole Torah, he will enlarge the writing, so as to diminish the number of columns, and he will make a test with another column. If the calculation shows that for the writing of the Torah more columns will be required than are contained in his sheets, he will use smaller characters and so secure a larger number of columns. He will make the test with column after column till the calculation comes out exact.&quot;, &quot;7. Once he knows the width of the column and the size of the characters, he can begin writing the scroll with that bundle of sheets. He then divides the parchment (sheets) into columns by ruling them off,\\u2014each column of the same width as that which his tests and calculations showed to be the right size. If three or four finger-breadths are left over beyond the last column, he should leave one finger-breadth and enough besides for sewing the sheet to the next, and cut off the rest, and need feel no apprehension, for at the end, more sheets will be added to make up for the superfluous strips that he cut off from each sheet. Nor need he make any calculations in regard to this, for the writing will be according to the number of columns.&quot;, &quot;8. So too, if one wishes to make the width of the scroll more or less than six handbreadths, he makes his calculation in the same way; and the length will be exactly equal to the circumference neither more nor less, provided that no mistake has been made in the calculation.&quot;, &quot;9. The finger-breadth in all the dimensions here and in the rest of the Torah is that of the medium sized finger. On careful examination, we find it to be the breadth of seven medium sized barley corns placed close together, this being equal to the length of two barley corns measured liberally. The handbreadth, wherever mentioned, is equal to four such finger-breadths. A cubit is six handbreadths.&quot;, &quot;10. The scroll which I wrote had a width of four finger-breadths to each column. The columns containing the Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15.1-18) &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) were each six finger-breadths wide. The number of lines in each column were fifty-one. The number of columns in the whole scroll were 226 columns. The length of the entire scroll was 13366 finger-breadths approximately.&quot;, &quot;11. The six finger-breadths left over were for the margin at the beginning and end of the scroll. The parchment skins on which we wrote were ramskins. Whenever you desire to write a scroll and follow these measurements completely or approximately, you need not weary yourself to make a calculation if you have one, two or three columns less or more; you will find that the length will be equal to the circumference.&quot;, &quot;12. No sheet should have less than three, nor more than eight columns. If a sheet is wide enough to contain nine columns, it is cut into two parts, one to contain four columns, the other to contain five columns. This rule applies to the beginning and middle of the scroll. But at the close, even if there is only left one verse to write on a column, that column is prepared on a separate sheet and sewn on to the other sheets.&quot;, &quot;13. For sewing the sheets together, only the sinews of a clean beast domestic or wild, including those that are &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt; (literally torn), flesh of a beast that had suffered from a mortal lesion.&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014flesh of a beast that had died or had not been slaughtered, or had been slaughtered by an unqualified or disqualified person.&lt;/i&gt; may be used. The law here is the same as in regard to phylacteries. This rule goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. Hence if the sheets have been sewn together but not with sinews or with sinews of an unclean animal, the scroll is unfit for use till the stitches are taken out and the sewing is done according to rule.&quot;, &quot;14. When the sheets are sewn together, they are sewn entirely from top to bottom, but a small portion is left above and below without being stitched, so that the scroll, when it is rolled up, may not be torn in the middle. Two wooden rollers are prepared, one for either end. The unwritten margins of parchment at the beginning and at the end are brought round the rollers and sewn with sinews, so that the scroll can be rolled over them; a clear space being left between the margin and the writing in the columns.&quot;, &quot;15. In case a scroll of the law had one of its sheets torn, the rent is sewn up, if it extends to two lines; if it extends to three lines, it is not sewn up. This rule applies to a scroll the gall dressing of which is no longer perceptible. But if the parchment still shows that it has been dressed, then, even when the rent extends to three lines, it is sewn up. So too, a rent between columns or between words is sewn up. For the stitching of the rents, the same kind of sinews are used as for the sheets. And wherever there is a rent, the scribe should make sure that no letter is missing or altered in form.&quot;], [&quot;1. You thus find that there are twenty factors, any one of which disqualifies a scroll of the law. If any of these occurs, the scroll is like one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught. It does not possess the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, and is not used for reading in public worship. They are as follows:&quot;, &quot;1) If it was written on the skin of a beast of an unclean species;&quot;, &quot;2) or on the skin of a beast of a clean species, which had not been tanned;&quot;, &quot;3) If the skin had been tanned but not for the express purpose of being used as a scroll of the law;&quot;, &quot;4) If it was written on the wrong side; in the case of parchment of whole hide on the side next to the flesh; in the case of parchment of the outer half of a split hide, on the side adjacent to the hair;&quot;, &quot;5) If it was written partly on parchment of whole hide and partly on that made of the outer half of split hide;&quot;, &quot;6) If it was written on the inner half of a split hide;&quot;, &quot;7) If it was written without the lines having been previously ruled;&quot;, &quot;8) If it was written with a dark writing fluid that does not make a permanent impression;&quot;, &quot;9) If it was written in other languages;&quot;, &quot;10) If it was written by a heretic (Epikouros) or other disqualified persons;&quot;, &quot;11) If the scribe wrote the names of God without special concentration of mind;&quot;, &quot;12) If a single letter was omitted;&quot;, &quot;13) If a single letter was added;&quot;, &quot;14) If one letter touched another;&quot;, &quot;15)\\tIf a single letter was so marred that it cannot be read at all, or resembles another letter, whether the defect is in the writing, or is due to a perforation, rent or smudge;&quot;, &quot;16)\\tIf the scribe wrote letters so far apart or so closely together that one word looks like two words or two words look like one word;&quot;, &quot;17)\\tIf he altered the form of the sections&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Wrote an \\u201copen\\u201d section as if it were a \\u201cclosed\\u201d section or vice versa.&lt;/i&gt;;&quot;, &quot;18)\\tIf he varied the form of writing the Songs;&quot;, &quot;19)\\tIf he wrote any other portion in the form of a Song;&quot;, &quot;20)\\tIf he did not sew the sheets with sinews of a beast of a clean species.&quot;, &quot;The other conditions stated are recommended as the best way of performing the duty of writing a scroll. Their non-observance does not render it unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;2. A scroll of the law that is fit for use is to be regarded as an object of extreme holiness and treated with great reverence. A person is forbidden to sell a scroll of the law even if he has nothing to eat, and even if he owns other scrolls. He may not even sell an old scroll, to buy a new one. A scroll may only be sold for one of two purposes, to provide means to enable one to study Torah or to marry\\u2014and then only if the owner has nothing else that he can sell.&quot;, &quot;3. If a scroll of the law has become worn out or been otherwise rendered unfit for use; it is placed in an earthenware vessel and buried beside the remains of deceased scholars. This is the appropriate method of \\&quot;concealing\\&quot; it (putting it away). Folders of scrolls that have become worn out are used as shrouds for the dead (found on the road) whose interment is a duty binding on all. This is the appropriate method of \\&quot;concealing\\&quot; them.&quot;, &quot;4. A case specially made for a scroll of the law and in which it has been placed, bands around the scrolls, the chest or structure in which it is deposited even though the scroll is in its case, as also a bench specially made on which to place a scroll of the law, and on which a scroll was placed are all subsidiaries of that which is sacred, and may not be thrown away. When worn out or broken, they are \\&quot;put away\\&quot;. The platforms, however, on which the Reader of the congregation stands and holds the scroll and tablets on which (scriptures) are written for a child\&#39;s instruction have no sanctity. Golden and silver pomegranates and other such ornaments, made for the embellishment of a scroll of the law are subsidiaries of that which is sacred; and it is forbidden to part with them to be used for secular purposes, unless they were sold with the intention to purchase with their proceeds a scroll of the law or a book of the Pentateuch.&quot;, &quot;5. It is permitted to place one scroll of the law upon another scroll, or, needless to add, upon single books of the Pentateuch. Single books of the Pentateuch may be placed upon books of the Prophets or Hagiography. But the books of the prophets and of the Hagiography are not placed upon single books of the Pentateuch; nor the latter on a scroll of the law. No sacred writings, not even Halachas or Hagadas (Legalistic or Homiletic works) may be thrown away. Amulets which contain scriptural matter, must not be taken with one into a lavatory (privy) unless they are covered with a skin.&quot;, &quot;6. A person may not, while bearing a scroll of the law in his arms, enter a bath-house, lavatory, or cemetery, even if the scroll is swathed in folders and placed in its case. A person must not read in it till he has moved away four cubits from the dead body (bath house) or lavatory. One may not hold a scroll of the law when nude. It is forbidden to sit down on a couch on which there is a scroll of the law.&quot;, &quot;7. Cohabitation is forbidden in a chamber where there is a scroll of the law, till it has been removed or placed in a receptacle which is itself placed in a receptacle not specially assigned to the scroll. If it has however been so assigned, even ten receptacles within each other, are regarded as a single receptacle. If a partition, ten handbreadths high, has been constructed for the scroll, cohabitation may take place if there is no other room. It may not take place, if there is another room, till the scroll has been removed.&quot;, &quot;8. All who are ritually unclean, even women in their menstruating period, and even a non-Israelite, may hold a scroll of the law and read in it, for the words of the Torah do not contract uncleanliness, provided that the holder\&#39;s hands are not dirty or soiled. They must therefore wash their hands and then they may touch it.&quot;, &quot;9. Every one who sees a person carrying a scroll of the law and proceeding with it must stand up before it; and all persons continue standing till the bearer of the scroll stops, having carried it to its appointed place, or passes out of sight. They are then permitted to resume their seats.&quot;, &quot;10. It is a duty to assign a fixed place for a scroll of the law, and to show it extreme honor and courtesy. The words in the tables of the covenant are in every scroll of the law. One may not expectorate before a scroll of the law, nor indecently expose oneself before it, nor stretch out one\&#39;s feet before it; nor place it upon the head in the way in which a burden is carried; nor turn one\&#39;s back to it unless it is at an elevation of ten handbreadths above the person.&quot;, &quot;11. If one is travelling from place to place and had a scroll of the law with him, he is not to put the scroll in a sack, place it on the donkey\&#39;s back and ride upon it. If, however, he is afraid of thieves, he may do so. When there is no such apprehension, he places it in his bosom close to his heart, and continues his journey, riding. Any one, sitting before a scroll of the law, should be inspired with a sense of earnestness, awe and reverence, for it is a faithful witness concerning all who come into the world, as it is said, \\&quot;It shall be therefore a witness against thee\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:26). All possible honor should be shown it. The ancient sages said, \\&quot;Whoever treats the Torah with contumely will be treated with contumely by his fellow-creatures. Whoever honors the Torah, will receive honor from his fellow creatures\\&quot; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:8). End of the laws concerning the scroll of the Law by the Grace of God.&quot;]], &quot;versionTitle&quot;: &quot;The Mishneh Torah by Maimonides. trans. by Moses Hyamson, 1937-1949&quot;, &quot;versionSource&quot;: &quot;http://primo.nli.org.il/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=NLI&amp;docId=NNL_ALEPH002108865&quot;, &quot;language&quot;: &quot;en&quot;}&#39;</pre></td>

The four Pentateuchal sections, beginning respectively, \\\\&quot;Sanctify unto me\\\\&quot; (Ex. 13:1-10), \\\\&quot;And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee\\\\&quot; (Exodus 13:11-16)\\\\u2014these two being in the Book of Exodus, \\\\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) \\\\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13-21), are written and covered with a skin. These are called &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; and are placed upon the head and bound on the arm. The omission of the point of a single letter in any one of these sections bars, according to Scriptural enactment, the use of all of them. They must all be written perfectly and in accordance with rule.&quot;, &quot;2. This is the case also with the two sections of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; beginning respectively, \\\\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) and \\\\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). If the point of a letter is missing in these two sections, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may not, according to Scriptural enactment, be used. The two sections must be written perfectly. So too, a scroll of the Law, in which a single letter is missing, is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;3. There are ten points in regard to &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; (phylacteries). The observance of each is enjoined by a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. The neglect of any of them is an absolute bar to the use of the &lt;i&gt;Tephillin.&lt;/i&gt; Hence, if there was a variation in any one of them, the &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; are unfit for use. Two of these have reference to the writing; eight, to the covering and the tying of the straps. The two points to be observed in the writing are that the sections must be written with ink, and must be written on parchment.&quot;, &quot;4. How is the ink prepared? Soot of oils or of pitch, wax or similar substance is collected; kneaded with gum of trees and a little honey; thoroughly wetted and pounded till it is like wafers. It is then stored away. When the scribe wishes to write, he soaks it in water in which gall-apples or similar substances have been steeped, and with this fluid he writes. Such writing when erased leaves no mark. This is the best way to write scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs.&lt;/i&gt; If the scribe has written with fluid of the gall-oak or of caper,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*Caper: flower-buds or seeds of a low shrub of Mediterranean countries, used as a condiment.&lt;/i&gt; since the writing stays and is not rubbed out, scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; so written are fit for use.&quot;, &quot;5. This being so, what is excluded by the Halacha, dating back to Moses, which ordains that these must be written with ink? It excludes pigments of other colors, such as red or green, etc.; so that if even a single letter in a scroll of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; was written with pigment of any other color [but black] or with gold, such a Scroll, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;6. There are three kinds of parchment, &lt;i&gt;Gewil, Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Duxustus.&lt;/i&gt; How are these made? A hide of domestic cattle or wild beast is taken. First, its hair is removed. It is then pickled in salt, afterwards prepared with flour and subsequently tanned with gall-wood or similar materials which contract the pores of the hide and make it durable. And this it is that is called &lt;i&gt;Gewil&lt;/i&gt; (parchment of whole-hide leather).&quot;, &quot;7. If, after removing the hair, the hide had been split through its thickness into two parts, so as to make of it two skins, one thin, namely that which had been next to the hair; the other thick, namely that which had been next to the flesh, and if these were prepared first with salt, then with flour and afterwards with gall-wood or similar substance the skin which had been next to the hair is called &lt;i&gt;Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; (= outer-skin parchment), and that which had been next to the flesh is called &lt;i&gt;Duxustus&lt;/i&gt; (inner-skin parchment).&quot;, &quot;8. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that the scroll of the Law should be written on &lt;i&gt;Gewil&lt;/i&gt; (whole hide parchment), and the writing should be on the side which had been next to the hair. The &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; should be written on &lt;i&gt;Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; (the exterior part of the split hide) and the writing should be on the side which had been nearer the flesh; and the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; should be written on &lt;i&gt;Duxustus&lt;/i&gt; (made of the inner part of the split hide), on the side which had been nearer the hair. If, on a &lt;i&gt;Kelaf,&lt;/i&gt; one writes on the side that had been next to the hair, or, on a &lt;i&gt;Gewil or Duxustus,&lt;/i&gt; one writes on the side that had been next to the flesh, the Scroll, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; so written is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;9. Though this is the rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai, yet if one writes a scroll of the Law on parchment made from the exterior half of a split hide it is fit for use. The reason why a complete hide is mentioned is in order to exclude that made from the inner half of the split hide. If one wrote on it a scroll of the Law, it is unfit for use. So also, if one wrote a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on the external half of a split hide or on an undivided hide, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use. The inner half of a split hide is recommended to be used, only as a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (specially approved).&quot;, &quot;10. Scrolls, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; are not written on the hide of a domestic or wild beast that is unclean or on the skin of an unclean bird. They are written on the hides of domestic or wild beasts that are clean or on the skins of clean birds, even when the flesh of these animals may not be eaten owing to their not having been slaughtered according to the ritual or being found to have suffered from a lesion of a mortal character. Nor are Scrolls, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; written on the skin of a fish, even if it be of a clean species, because of its foulness. For this is not removed by tanning.&quot;, &quot;11. The undivided skin for a scroll of the Law, and the external half of the hide to be used for &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or for a scroll of the Law must be tanned for their specific purposes. If they were not expressly so tanned, they are not fit for use. Accordingly, if a non-Israelite or a Samaritan tanned them, they are unfit for use. Even if the Samaritan was instructed to tan a particular hide for the purpose of its being used for a scroll of the Law or &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; it is unfit for use; since he works with his own purposes in mind, not with those of his employer. Hence, anything that has to be done with a purpose in mind, if done by a Samaritan, is unfit for use. The skin for a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; does not require to be tanned for that express purpose.&quot;, &quot;12. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that a scroll of the Law or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may only be written on parchment that is ruled. Phylacteries need not be ruled, because they are covered. So too, phylacteries and a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may be written from memory, as these sections are recited by and are familiar to everyone. But not a single letter may be written in a scroll of the Law, except from a written copy of the text.&quot;, &quot;13. A scroll of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; written by a heretic must be burnt. If written by a Samaritan, by a Jew converted to another faith, by one who surrenders Israelites to tyrants, by a slave, woman or minor, they are unfit for use, and must be hidden; for it is said, \\\\&quot;And thou shalt bind them\\\\&quot;, \\\\&quot;And thou shalt write them\\\\&quot;. The implication is that only that person is qualified to write them, who is charged with the duty of putting on &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and believes in the obligation. If they are found in the possession of a heretic, and it is not known who wrote them, they should be hidden. If found in the possession of a Samaritan or non-Israelite, they are fit to be used. Scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; are not to be bought from non-Israelites for more than their value, so as not to accustom the latter to steal these holy articles or take them by force.&quot;, &quot;14. A scroll of the Law, phylacteries or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth,&lt;/i&gt; written on the skin of a beast or bird\\\\u2014whether domestic or wild\\\\u2014which belongs to an unclean species, or written on skins that have not been tanned, and likewise a scroll of the Law or phylacteries written on skins not expressly tanned for those purposes, are unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;15. If one who writes a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; had not concentrated his mind while writing, and wrote one of the Names of God without express intent, these articles are unfit for use. Accordingly, when one is writing the name of God, even if an Israelite king greets him, he must not return the greeting. If he is writing two or three names of God, he may pause between writing one and writing the others and may respond.&quot;, &quot;16. After dipping the pen in ink to write the Name of God, the scribe does not start with a letter of the name but with a letter of the previous word. If he altogether forgot to write the name of God, he writes it above the line. But to write part of the name on the line and part above the line makes the scroll unfit for use. Other words that the scribe forgot to write may be written partly on the line and partly above it. These rules apply to a scroll of the Law. But in a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; or in phylacteries not a letter may be written above the line. If the scribe forgot even one letter, he must hide what he wrote and write a fresh slip. In all of them (Scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; and Phylacteries) it is permissible to write the name of God upon a surface from which writing has been erased or obliterated.&quot;, &quot;17. Scribes of scrolls, phylacteries and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; are forbidden to turn over the parchment sheet with its written surface beneath touching the board on which it lies, but should cover it with a cloth or fold it.&quot;, &quot;18. If, after a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; had passed out of the scribe\\\&#39;s hands, he makes the statement, \\\\&quot;I did not write the name of God in them with that purpose distinctly in mind\\\\&quot;, he is not believed to the extent of rendering them unfit for use, but his statement is accepted so far that he forfeits his entire remuneration. The reason why he is not believed so as to render them unfit for use is because his motive may possibly have been to cause a loss to the person who bought or hired them. It would seem however that his statement would only cause him to forfeit that quota of remuneration to which the writing of the names of God would entitle him. Hence, if he stated, \\\\&quot;the skins of this scroll of the Law or of these phylacteries were not expressly tanned for those purposes\\\\&quot;, then since in such a case he is believed so fully that he forfeits the whole of his remuneration, his statement is also credited so as to disqualify the articles from being used\\\\u2014it being a matter of general knowledge that if the skins had not been expressly tanned for the purpose of being made into phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, the scribe receives no remuneration whatsoever.&quot;, &quot;19. Phylacteries and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; may only be written in square Hebrew script. Permission was also given to write scrolls of the Law in Greek characters but not in those of any other foreign tongue. The ancient Greek script has gone out of use, been corrupted and become obsolete. Hence, at the present day, all three religious articles,\\\\u2014Scroll of the Law, Tephillin and Mezuzah,\\\\u2014are only written in the square Hebrew script. Care must be taken in writing that no letter shall adhere to any other letter; for any letter which is not completely surrounded on all four sides by a blank space of parchment has been improperly written. Any letter that cannot be read by a child of ordinary intelligence\\\\u2014not particularly bright or dull\\\\u2014is improperly written. Thus a &lt;i&gt;Yod&lt;/i&gt; must not be like a &lt;i&gt;Vav&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Vav&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Yod,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Koph&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Beth,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Beth&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Koph,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Daleth&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Resh,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Resh&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Daleth,&lt;/i&gt; etc., so that the reader may be able to read fluently.&quot;, &quot;20. If the parchment was perforated, the scribe must not write on the perforation. A perforation over which the ink passes is not regarded as a perforation, and it is permitted to write across it. Hence, it is permitted to write on the skin of a bird that has been tanned. Should the parchment have become perforated, after it has been written on, if the perforation is in the interior of a letter, as, for example, in a &lt;i&gt;H\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mem,&lt;/i&gt; etc., it is regarded as properly written. Should one of the sides of a letter have been perforated, so that the letter is divided\\\\u2014then the rule is that if there is left of the part that is unperforated as much as would form a small letter, it is regarded as properly written, provided that it does not resemble a different letter. If the part that is left unperforated is not as much as would form a small letter, it is not regarded as properly written.&quot;], [&quot;1. How are the sections in the phylactery that is placed on the head to be written? The four sections are respectively written on four separate slips of parchment; each slip is rolled up separately and they are then placed in four compartments composed of one skin. As to the phylactery placed on the arm, these four sections are written in four columns on one slip of parchment. This slip is rolled up like a scroll of the Law from the last column to the first and is placed in one [leather] compartment.&quot;, &quot;2. The scribe must exercise care in writing these sections, for if he wrote a closed section as an open one,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*that is, began the section on a new line where only a space of nine letters should have been left blank.&lt;/i&gt; or wrote an open section as if it were closed, the slip is unfit for use. The first three sections are, all of them, open. The last section, that beginning, \\\\&quot;And it shall come to pass, if ye will hearken diligently\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is closed.&quot;, &quot;3. He must exercise care in regard to the words that are &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;**with or without a &lt;i&gt;Yod&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Vav,&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&lt;/i&gt; that all the four sections should be written as they are in an examined scroll of the Law. For if he wrote a word &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; that should have been written &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; the slip is unfit for use till the superfluous letter has been obliterated. If a word that is &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; has been written &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; the slip is unfit for use and cannot be made good. The following is the list of the words in these four sections that are &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&quot;, &quot;[&lt;i&gt;For paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 (lists of&lt;/i&gt; plene &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; defective &lt;i&gt;words), see the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 121b and 122a&lt;/i&gt;.]&quot;, &quot;6. The &lt;i&gt;Ayin&lt;/i&gt; of Shema and &lt;i&gt;Daleth&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Echad&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 6:4) are to be written in larger type.&quot;, &quot;8. He must pay attention to the \\\\&quot;crowns\\\\&quot; (tittles) above the letters. These are like an upright &lt;i&gt;Zayin&lt;/i&gt; and are placed on each letter to which such a crown belongs as written in the scroll of the Law. The following are the letters in the four sections thus ornamented:&quot;, &quot;9. In the first section, there is only one such letter, namely the closed &lt;i&gt;Mem&lt;/i&gt; in Meeyamim which has over it three &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. In the second section, there are five letters, each of them a &lt;i&gt;H\\\\u00e9;&lt;/i&gt; and on each, there are four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. These are the &lt;i&gt;H\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Unesanah; the first and the last &lt;i&gt;H\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Hikshah; the &lt;i&gt;H\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Vayaharog; the &lt;i&gt;H\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Yadchah.&quot;, &quot;10. The third section has five such letters. The &lt;i&gt;Koof&lt;/i&gt; in Uvekoomecha has over it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines; the &lt;i&gt;Koof&lt;/i&gt; in Ukeshartam has over it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines; the two letters &lt;i&gt;Teth,&lt;/i&gt; and the letter &lt;i&gt;P\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Letotaphoth have on each of them four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines.&quot;, &quot;11. The fourth section has five such letters. The &lt;i&gt;P\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; of Veasaphta has above it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. The &lt;i&gt;Tav&lt;/i&gt; of Veasaphta has one &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped line. The two letters &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; and the letter &lt;i&gt;P\\\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Letotaphoth have on each of them four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. Altogether, the letters thus ornamented are sixteen. If the scribe wholly omitted these ornaments, added to them or omitted them over some of the letters, he has not rendered the phylacteries unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;12. If one buys phylacteries from one who is not a recognized expert, he has to examine them. If he bought from him one hundred parchment slips, he examines three slips, either two of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the arm or two slips of those in the phylacteries worn on the arm and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head. If he found all these three correct, a presumption is established in the vendor\\\&#39;s favour, and all his phylacteries are fit for use and the rest need not be examined. If he bought them however in several bundles, this examination (of three slips) must take place in each bundle, there being a presumption that the several bundles came from different individuals.&quot;, &quot;13. A man who wrote phylacteries with his own hand or purchased them from an expert or, having bought them of a non-expert, examined them and replaced them in their leather containers, need never re-examine them, even after the lapse of many years. As long as the leather container remains sound, the presumption that they are sound holds good. Nor is it apprehended that a letter has been obliterated or perforated. Hillel the Elder was wont to say, \\\\&quot;These phylacteries belonged to my mother\\\&#39;s father.\\\\&quot;&quot;], [&quot;1. There are eight rules for the making of phylacteries; all of them are traditionally ascribed to Moses who received them on Sinai; hence the observance of all of them is indispensable. A variation from any of them renders the phylacteries unfit for use. The rules are as follows: The phylacteries (that is, the external leather containers) must be square; they are to be sewn in such a way as to retain the square shape; their diagonals must be those of a square so that all the angles shall be equal; the leather container of the phylactery for the head shall have the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; embossed on the right and on the left side; each of the slips of parchment on which the sections from the Pentateuch are written is to be wrapt in a cover; this is to be tied with hair, and then the slips are placed in their respective compartments which are sewn up with sinews; a border with a fold open at both ends shall be made of the skin of the base for the strap to pass through freely; the straps shall be black, and have the special knot, that is known to all, in the shape of a &lt;i&gt;Daleth.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;2. How is the phylactery for the head made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length, breadth and height. It is of no consequence however if the height is more than the breadth or less. What is essential is that the length and breadth shall be equal. Three grooves are cut in the block so that it is divided into four parts as in this figure &lt;img src=\\\\&quot;data:image/jpg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEBLAEsAAD/2wBDAAUDBAQEAwUEBAQFBQUGBwwIBwcHBw8LCwkMEQ8SEhEP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\\\\nClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUH//Z\\\\n\\\\&quot;&gt;. A piece of leather is taken and soaked in water. The wooden block is put in it and the leather is inserted into each groove. While it is still damp, it is crinkled on both sides, to make a shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; with three lines on the right side of the wearer and with four lines on the left side.&quot;, &quot;3. The leather is left on the wood till it dries; it is then slipped off from the wooden block, with the result that it has the shape of four compartments. The prescribed sections of Scripture written on slips of parchment are placed, one in each compartment. A portion of the leather is drawn round and beneath the cube (to form its base). This is sewn up at its four sides. A portion is left in this skin at the base for the strap to pass through as in a loop. This it is which is called the bridge.&quot;, &quot;4. How are the phylacteries for the arm made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length and breadth. It is to be a finger-breadth in height, or a little more or less. The block is covered with wet leather which is left on till it dries. It is then removed, and in the place where the wood had been, a single slip of parchment on which the four prescribed sections of Scripture are written, is inserted. A portion of the leather is drawn round below and is sewn up at its four sides. Of this base a part is left to form a loop for the strap to pass through.&quot;, &quot;5. What is the order in which the sections are placed in the phylactery for the head? The last section, that beginning, \\\\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye will hearken diligently\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is placed in the first compartment, to the right of the wearer; the section beginning, \\\\&quot;Hear O Israel\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4) in the compartment adjacent to it; the section beginning, \\\\&quot;And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God will bring thee\\\\&quot; (Exodus 13:11), next to the one containing the section, \\\\&quot;Hear O Israel\\\\&quot;, and the section beginning, \\\\&quot;Sanctify unto me every first born\\\\&quot; (Exodus 13:1) in the fourth compartment which would be to the left of the wearer of the phylactery; so that anyone facing the wearer and reading what is before him would read the sections in the right Scriptural order as in the annexed figure. If there&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*Sections beginning with verse:&lt;/i&gt; was a deviation from this order, the phylacteries are not fit for use.&quot;, &quot;6. The sections for the phylactery for the arm are written in four columns on one long strip of parchment like a scroll of the Law, and in the order in which they are found in the Pentateuch as in the annexed figure.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;**Sections beginning with verse:&lt;/i&gt; If the scribe wrote them on four separate slips and placed them in one compartment, he has done what is required, and need not attach them to each other.&quot;, &quot;7. When he rolls up the parchment slips containing the sections, for the phylacteries worn on the head or on the arm, he rolls them from the end to the beginning so that, if opened, each section can be read from the beginning to the end.&quot;, &quot;8. When the slips are about to be placed in their respective compartments, they are wrapped in a cloth, over which they are fastened with hair. They are then deposited in their compartments. This hair must be that of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species; and may even be taken from animals which are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;***&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;***&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\\\u2014died of itself or, by extension of meaning, not properly killed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;\\\\u2020&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;\\\\u2020&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;\\\\u2014torn by wild beast; by extension of meaning, found to have suffered from mortal disease or lesion.&lt;/i&gt; The custom that has come into general use is to fasten the slips with hair taken from calves\\\&#39; tails.&quot;, &quot;9. The leather receptacles of the phylacteries are only sewn with sinews of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species, and may be taken from animals of such species even if they are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\\\u2014died of itself or, by extension of meaning, not properly killed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;\\\\u2014torn by wild beast; by extension of meaning, found to have suffered from mortal disease or lesion.&lt;/i&gt; The sinews used are those found in the heel of the domestic or wild beast, which are white and tough. They are softened by pounding them with stones or similar substances, till they become like flax. They are spun and twined, and then used for sewing the phylacteries and the sheets of the scrolls of the Law.&quot;, &quot;10. The receptacles are to be sewn in such a way as to preserve the square contour of the base. It is a broadly established rule that on each side, there are to be three stitches, making altogether twelve stitches, whether the phylactery is for the arm or for the head. If the scribe desires to make ten or fourteen stitches, he may do so. The stitch must pass through the leather on both sides.&quot;, &quot;11. The grooves of the phylacteries for the head ought to extend to the base where the stitching is done. If the grooves are recognizable so that the four divisions clearly appear, the phylacteries are fit for use, even though the grooves do not extend to the base. If however the grooves are not recognizable, the phylacteries are unfit for use. Within each groove, above the leather, a thread or cord ought to be passed so as to separate the compartments from each other. The general custom is to draw through each of the three grooves a sinew of the same kind as those used for the stitches.&quot;, &quot;12. How are the thongs fixed? A strip of leather is taken as wide as the length of a barley corn. If wider, it is fit for use. The length of the strap of the phylactery for the head should be sufficient to encircle the head, form the knot and leave enough for the straps on either side to reach to the navel or a little higher. The strap for the phylactery of the arm should be sufficiently long to encircle the forearm, form the knot, extend down to the middle finger, about which it is to be wound three times and then fastened. If the straps exceed in length the foregoing dimensions, they are also fit for use.&quot;, &quot;13. The thong of the phylactery for the head is inserted in the loop open at both ends. It is measured to fit the wearer\\\&#39;s head, and then tied in a rectangular knot like a &lt;i&gt;Daleth.&lt;/i&gt; This knot, every scholar should learn how to make. It is impossible to teach its form by description; this can only be taught by ocular demonstration. In the case of the phylactery for the arm, the thong is tied in a knot in the shape of a &lt;i&gt;Yod.&lt;/i&gt; The thong of the phylactery for the arm should move freely in the loop, so that the wearer can loosen or tighten it when he puts it on his arm.&quot;, &quot;14. The thongs of the phylacteries, whether for the head or for the arm, must have their exterior surface black. This is a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. But the other side of the thongs, being close to the skin, are fit for use if they are green or white. They must not however be red, for if the thong were inadvertently turned, the color of its lower surface would subject the wearer to ignominy. The lower side of the thongs should not be otherwise in color than the base of the leather case containing the parchment slips. If the latter is green, the former should be green; if white, the former should be white. It is comely if the phylacteries are wholly black, namely, both the case containing the slips of parchment and the thongs.&quot;, &quot;15. The leather which forms the receptacles of the phylacteries and its thongs is to be made from the hide of a domestic or wild quadruped or skin of a fowl that belongs to the clean species, and may even be taken from those of these species that are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Terefah.&lt;/i&gt; If they were made of the skin or hide of unclean species, or if the phylacteries were covered with gold, the phylacteries are unfit for use. The leather for the thongs must be expressly tanned for their intended purpose to be thongs of phylacteries. The leather which forms the receptacles for the phylacteries need not be tanned. Even if it consists of raw hide it is fit for use. Many places have the custom to make them of raw hide.&quot;, &quot;16. The receptacles of the phylacteries may not be prepared by any one but an Israelite; for the making of these is like the writing of the prescribed sections because of the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; which is embossed on the phylactery for the head, as we have already stated. Hence, if a non-Israelite made or sewed the phylacteries, they are unfit for use. So too, whoever is disqualified from writing the prescribed sections for the phylacteries may not prepare them.&quot;, &quot;17. The phylactery for the head may not be transformed into a phylactery for the arm, but the latter may be changed into the former; on the principle that an object may not be degraded from a higher to a lower sacred use. So too, the thong of the phylactery for the head may not be transferred to a phylactery for the arm. This rule only applies to phylacteries that had been worn. But with regard to phylacteries for the head that no one had ever worn, if it is desired to transform them into phylacteries for the arm, this may be done. How is this effected? It is covered with leather so that it appears as one receptacle. The phylactery may then be bound on the arm.&quot;, &quot;18. In case the stitches of the phylacteries are broken, they become unfit for use if there are two broken stitches adjacent to each other, or three not adjacent. This rule applies to old phylacteries. New phylacteries are fit for use as long as they keep their surface unimpaired. The following would be called new. If, at the place where the stitches have given way, part of the leather is held in the hand so that the phylactery is suspended, and the leather is strong enough not to be further torn, such phylacteries would be regarded as new. If however the leather is not strong enough to bear the weight of the phylacteries so suspended, but would tear, such phylacteries are regarded as old.&quot;, &quot;19. A thong that has become broken is not to be tied together nor sewn up; but it is to be removed, put away, and replaced by a new thong. The parts of the broken thong are unfit for use unless the length and breadth of the part is of the prescribed dimension or larger. Care should always be taken that the external surface of the thongs should be above, when the phylacteries are bound on the hand or round the head. End of the chapter.&quot;], [&quot;1. Where is the phylactery of the head placed? It is placed on that part of the crown of the head, where the hair adjacent to the forehead ends, and this is the place where an infant\\\&#39;s brain pulsates (the fontanelle). The phylactery needs to be adjusted so that it lies in the centre of the forehead, in a line with the point between the eyes. The knot should be at the top of the back of the neck, which is the end of the skull.&quot;, &quot;2. The phylactery of the hand is bound on the left arm over the biceps muscle which is the flesh that stands out on the upper arm that is intermediate between the shoulder-blade and forearm, so that when the upper arm is held close to the ribs, the phylactery will be opposite the heart and thus the precept will be fulfilled, \\\\&quot;And these words \\\\u2026 shall be upon thine heart\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:6).&quot;, &quot;3. To lay the phylactery of the hand on the palm or that of the head on the forehead is the practice of the Sadducees. He who makes the phylactery round like a nut is not fulfilling the precept in any way. A left-handed person lays the phylactery on his right arm, used by him as his left. If one is ambidextrous, he lays it on his left arm, which is the same as the left arm of any other person. The places where the phylacteries are respectively bound and laid are known by tradition.&quot;, &quot;4. The lack of a phylactery for the head does not preclude one from putting on that of the hand, nor does the lack of a phylactery of the hand preclude one from putting on that for the head. Each is a duty separate and independent. What blessings are recited? For the phylactery of the head, the formula is as follows: \\\\&quot;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and given us a command concerning the precept of phylacteries\\\\&quot;. For that of the hand, the form is as follows: \\\\&quot;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to lay the phylacteries\\\\&quot;.&quot;, &quot;5. This rule applies to the case where a person puts on one phylactery only. But when one lays both phylacteries, he recites one blessing, namely, the form, \\\\&quot;And hast commanded us to lay the phylacteries\\\\&quot;, binds the phylactery on his arm, and then puts on that for the head. When they are removed, that on the head is removed first, and afterwards that on the arm.&quot;, &quot;6. When a person has recited the blessing, \\\\&quot;Who hast commanded us to lay phylacteries\\\\&quot;, and bound the phylactery on his arm, he is forbidden to converse, even to the extent of acknowledging his master\\\&#39;s greeting, till he has put on the phylactery of the head. If he conversed he has committed a transgression; and when putting on the phylactery for the head, he must recite another blessing, viz: the form, \\\\&quot;Who hast given us a command concerning the precept of the phylacteries\\\\&quot;, and then he puts on the phylactery for the head.&quot;, &quot;7. On each occasion when one puts on phylacteries, the blessing is recited, even if they are removed and put on again several times in the day. It is a universal rule with regard to religious precepts that the appropriate blessings are recited prior to their performance. Hence too, the blessing for the phylactery of the hand has to be recited after it is placed on the biceps muscle before the thong is tightened, for the fastening constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.&quot;, &quot;8. When a person removes his phylacteries, and puts them in a bag, he should not place the phylactery of the hand beneath and that for the head above it, because when he will again have occasion to put them on, he will come into contact with the phylactery of the head first, will thus be under the necessity of putting it down and take out the phylactery of the hand, the former not being put on before the latter. It is forbidden to leave a precept and pass on to the fulfillment of another religious duty, the rule being that the duty that first presents itself should first engage our attention. Hence, the phylactery for the hand should be placed above so that one may come into contact with it first, and the phylacteries be put on in the right order.&quot;, &quot;9. A bag expressly intended to contain phylacteries and into which these have been placed, becomes consecrated and may not be put to secular use. If the bag was intended for this express purpose of containing phylacteries but had never contained them, or if phylacteries had been casually placed in a bag not set aside for that use, it does not become sacred, and continues to be a secular object as it had been hitherto. Phylacteries may not be suspended by their thong or by the part which contains the scriptural section. But the bag containing the phylacteries may be suspended.&quot;, &quot;10. The proper time for putting on phylacteries is when it is day and not when it is night, for it is said, \\\\&quot;Day by day\\\\&quot;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*Usually rendered, \\\\u201cfrom year to year\\\\u201d, referring to observance of the feast of Passover.&lt;/i&gt; (Exodus 13:10). \\\\&quot;The ordinance\\\\&quot; mentioned in this verse refers to the precept of phylacteries. So it is said, \\\\&quot;And it shall be for a sign\\\\&quot;, while Sabbaths and festivals are them-also, Sabbaths and festivals are not seasons for putting on phylacteries, for selves a sign. When is the proper time in the day to put on phylacteries? At the hour when a person can see his neighbour at a distance of four cubits and recognize him. The period extends till sunset.&quot;, &quot;11. A person who put on phylacteries before sunset, is permitted when it becomes dusk, to continue to wear them, even throughout the night. The multitude however is not to be so taught. Everyone should be instructed not to wear phylacteries at night, but to remove them at sunset. Whoever deliberately puts on phylacteries after sunset, violates a prohibition, for it is said, \\\\&quot;And thou shalt keep this ordinance in its season, day by day\\\\&quot; (Exodus 13:10).&quot;, &quot;12. If the sun sets while a man with the phylacteries on his head was on the road, he places his hand upon the phylactery till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If Sabbath or a festival arrived while he was sitting in the house of study, with the phylactery on his head, he places his hand upon it till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If there is a house near the City Wall,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*the house of study was outside the town.&lt;/i&gt; where the phylacteries could be safely left, he should leave them there. If he did not remove them after sunset, because he had no place where they would be safe, and he kept them on for the sake of security, his conduct is lawful.&quot;, &quot;13. One who is exempt from reading the &lt;i&gt;Shema&lt;/i&gt; is exempt from putting on phylacteries. If a child less than thirteen years of age knows how to take care of his phylacteries, his father purchases a set for him, so as to train him in the practice of religious precepts. Those who suffer intestinal troubles or have difficulty in controlling their sphincters are exempt from the obligation of putting on phylacteries. All who are ritually unclean are under the same obligation of putting on phylacteries as those who are ritually clean. One, who is in pain or whose mind is not calm and composed is exempt from the duty of putting on phylacteries; for the wearer must not allow his consciousness of them to wander. Priests while engaged in the temple service, Levites during the recital of hymns in their appointed places, Israelites while they are in the Sanctuary, are exempt from the duties of reciting the prayers and putting on phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;14. As long as one is wearing phylacteries, he should frequently touch them with his fingers, so as not to lose consciousness of them for a single moment. For their degree of sanctity is higher than that of the golden plate which the High Priest wore on his forehead. On the latter, the name of God was engraved once only, while the phylactery for the head contains the tetragrammaton twenty-one times, and the phylactery for the arm, an equal number of times.&quot;, &quot;15. A requisite in wearing phylacteries is physical cleanliness. One should take care that no flatus escapes him while he has them on. Hence, he may not, while wearing them, indulge in regular sleep or even doze. But if they are covered with a cloth, he may doze, even while wearing them. How so? He places his head between his knees and dozes in a sitting posture. If his phylacteries were folded and held in his hand, the holder may even sleep in the regular way.&quot;, &quot;16. No meal, unless it be of a casual character, may be eaten, while one wears phylacteries (without previous preparation). Before proceeding to a regular meal, he removes them, places them on the table, washes his hands, puts them on again, recites the blessing for food while he has them on.&quot;, &quot;17. If one feels a call of nature while wearing phylacteries, he is not to deposit them, before entering the lavatory, in the crevices that open towards the public thoroughfare, lest passers-by may take them. How should he act? Even if he needs to relieve the bladder while he is at a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, he should remove the phylacteries, roll them up in his garment, as a scroll is rolled up, grasp them in his right hand opposite his heart, taking care that not a thong projects outside his hand as much as a hand breadth; then he enters, relieves himself, and, after having left, goes away to a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, and puts on his phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;18. This rule only applies to the case of a permanent lavatory. But one may not enter an extemporized lavatory with phylacteries even rolled up. They should be removed and given to another person for safe keeping.&quot;, &quot;19. If one wearing phylacteries needed to go to the lavatory at eventide when there would be no more time to put them on again, he should not enter with the phylacteries rolled up in his garment, even to relieve his bladder, if the lavatory is a permanent one. How should he act? He should remove the phylacteries, place them in their bag which must be at least a hand breadth long, or even in a smaller bag provided it is not specially assigned as a receptable for phylacteries. This he keeps in his hand and enters. Thus, too, at night time, if he needs to visit the lavatory, he may put the phylacteries in a bag which he keeps in his hand when entering.&quot;, &quot;20. Translation omitted.&quot;, &quot;21. Translation omitted.&quot;, &quot;22. One is permitted to put on phylacteries in that portion of a bathhouse where all are attired. In that portion where some are in their attire while others are nude, the phylacteries which one wears need not be removed, but they may not be put on. Where all are nude, the phylacteries must be removed, and needless to add, they may not be put on.&quot;, &quot;23. A person should not walk in a cemetery with phylacteries on his head. When he is within a distance of four cubits from a corpse or a grave, the phylacteries are to be removed till he has passed on to a distance outside four cubits. Phylacteries must not be put on before one is decently covered and has put on his garments. If a person is carrying a burden on his head, he must remove the phylactery from his head, and may not put it on till he has removed the burden. Even a kerchief [alone] may not be put upon the head when one is wearing phylacteries. But he puts his cap over the phylactery.&quot;, &quot;24. In a room where there are phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, marital intercourse may not take place, till these have been taken out, or placed in a receptacle which itself is enclosed in another receptacle not assigned to the use of phylacteries or a scroll of the Law. If the latter receptacle has been so assigned, and even if there be ten such receptacles, they are all regarded as one receptacle. If he placed the sacred articles in two receptacles, one within the other, they may be put for security under his pillow between the bolster and the coverlid\\\\u2014not however exactly beneath his head. This may be done even if his wife shares his couch.&quot;, &quot;25. The sanctity of phylacteries is a high degree of sanctity. As long as phylacteries are on a man\\\&#39;s head and arm, he is humble and God-fearing, is not drawn into frivolity and idle talk, does not dwell on evil thoughts but occupies his mind with thoughts of truth and righteousness. A man should therefore endeavour to wear phylacteries the whole day, this being the right way of fulfilling the precept. It is said of &lt;i&gt;Rav,&lt;/i&gt; the disciple of our Sainted Teacher (R. Judah, the Prince), that throughout his life no one saw him, without Torah, Tzitzis (fringes on his garments) or phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;26. Although the proper mode of fulfilling the precept is to wear phylacteries the whole day, it is especially a duty to do so during the recital of prayers. The sages say, \\\\&quot;Whoever reads the &lt;i&gt;Shema&lt;/i&gt; without wearing phylacteries is regarded as testifying falsely in his own person.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*He recites the Commandment to wear &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and does not fulfill it.&lt;/i&gt; Whoever does not wear phylacteries at all violates eight affirmative precepts, since in each of the four sections, the command is set forth to lay phylacteries on the head and on the arm. Whoever wears phylacteries regularly will be blessed with longevity, as it is said, \\\&#39;The Lord is upon them: they shall live\\\&#39;\\\\&quot; (Isaiah 38:16).&quot;], [&quot;1. How is the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;**Sections of Scripture placed on doorposts.&lt;/i&gt; written? Two sections of the Pentateuch, those beginning, \\\\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4) and, \\\\&quot;And it shall come to pass\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) are written in a single column on one slip of parchment. A space of half a nail\\\&#39;s breadth is left as a margin above and below the column. If the Pentateuchal sections were written in two or three columns, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use. They must not however be written in the shape of a tail (broad at the top line and gradually narrowing to a point), or of a circle, or of a tent (narrow at the top and broadening to the base). A &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; written in any of these forms is unfit for use. If the text was written out of order, for example, if the second section was in front of the first, it is unfit for use. If it was written on two slips of parchment, even though these were sewn together, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use. A Scroll of the Law that has become worn out or phylacteries that are worn out may not be used for a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Nor may margins cut off from a scroll of the Law be so used; for anything dedicated to a sacred purpose may not be degraded from a higher to a lower degree of sacredness.&quot;, &quot;2. It is a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (an act of piety) to separate the section beginning, \\\\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\\\&quot; from that beginning, \\\\&quot;And it shall come to pass\\\\&quot; by a \\\\&quot;closed\\\\&quot; space (blank of nine letters). If the division between the two sections was an \\\\&quot;open\\\\&quot; one (the second section beginning a new line), the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use, as, in the Pentateuch, the second section does not immediately follow the first. Special heed should be paid to the tittles in the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; The following are the tittles which are made in the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;3. In the first section, there are seven letters, each of which should have above it three upright lines in the shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Zain.&lt;/i&gt; They are the &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ayin&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Shema; Nun&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nafshecha;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Totafoth.&lt;/i&gt; The second section has six letters, each of which should have above it three &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. They are the &lt;i&gt;Gimel&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Degancha;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Totafoth;&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;Tzadi&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Ha-aretz.&lt;/i&gt; If the tittles were omitted or if they are more or less than those specified, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; has not been rendered unfit for use. But if it was written without the lines having been ruled, or if the scribe paid no heed to &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; letters, or if he added in the text even a single letter, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;4. It is a universal custom to write the word &lt;i&gt;Shaddai&lt;/i&gt; (Almighty) on the other side of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; opposite the blank space between the two sections. As this word is written on the outside, the practice is unobjectionable. They, however, who write names of angels, holy names, a Biblical text or inscriptions usual on seals, within the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; are among those who have no portion in the world to come. For these fools not only fail to fulfill the commandment but they treat an important precept that expresses the Unity of God, the love of Him, and His worship, as if it were an amulet to promote their own personal interests; for, according to their foolish minds, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is something that will secure for them advantage in the vanities of the world.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*A reproof to those who sell Mezuzoth to be worn as amulets !&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;5. It is a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (act of piety) to write &lt;i&gt;Al Ha-aretz&lt;/i&gt; (the last two words) on the last line, either at the beginning or in the middle of the line. All the scribes follow the custom of writing the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; in twenty-two lines, and (the last two words) &lt;i&gt;Al Ha-aretz&lt;/i&gt; at the commencement of the last line. The following are the words in order, which begin each of the lines: (See the Hebrew text on the corresponding right-hand side, page 127b.)&quot;, &quot;6. When the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is folded, it is rolled up from the end of the line to the beginning, so that anyone opening it is able to read it from the beginning to the end of the line. After it has been rolled up, it is placed in a cylinder of reed, wood or other material, which is attached to the doorpost with a nail; or else a cavity is hollowed out in the doorpost, into which the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is inserted.&quot;, &quot;7. Before one affixes it to the doorpost, he recites the blessing, \\\\&quot;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us to affix the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah\\\\&quot;.&lt;/i&gt; No blessing is recited at the time when it is written, because the affixing of it constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.&quot;, &quot;8. If one suspended it on a staff, it is unfit, for this is not affixing it (to the doorpost). If one placed it behind the door, he has not fulfilled the precept. If he perforated the door and forced the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; into it like a nail, as a bolt is inserted in the staple-ring, it is unfit. If it was placed in a hollow of the doorpost at a depth of a hand-breadth, it is unfit. If one cut a stick, put a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on it, attached this stick to other sticks and made of them all a doorpost, it is unfit, because the affixing of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; preceded the erection of the doorpost.&quot;, &quot;9. The &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; of a private dwelling is examined once every seven years; that attached to a public building twice in the Jubilee (fifty years). The object is to ascertain whether a letter has been torn away or obliterated; because owing to the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; being affixed to walls, it is liable to decay.&quot;, &quot;10. The fulfillment of the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is incumbent upon all Israelites, including women and slaves (of Israelites). Children under the age of thirteen years are trained to affix the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; to their rooms. One who rents a dwelling outside the Holy Land, or lodges at an inn in the Holy Land is exempt from the obligation of affixing a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; for a period of thirty days after beginning his occupancy. But if one rents a home in the Holy Land, the duty of affixing a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; devolves immediately.&quot;, &quot;11. If one lets a dwelling to another person, the duty devolves upon the lessee to bring a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; and attach it, even if he has to pay for doing so, for the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is the personal obligation of the occupant and not an obligation attaching to the structure. When he surrenders possession, he must not, on quitting the premises, remove the Mezuzah. But if the owner is a non-Israelite, the Jewish tenant, when leaving, takes it away.&quot;], [&quot;1. There are ten conditions which must exist in a dwelling, to put the occupant under an obligation to affix a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If one of these is absent, he is exempt. These are as follows: The dwelling must have a superficial area of four cubits by four cubits or more; it must have two door-posts, a lintel, a roof and doors; the entrance should be ten hand-breadths high or more; it must be a secular (not a sacred) structure; it must have been erected for human occupancy, for honored use (not a lavatory), and built for permanent habitation.&quot;, &quot;2. A dwelling, the superficial area of which is less than four cubits by four cubits does not require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If its area is equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits, even if it is circular in shape or has five angles, or, needless to add, if its length is greater than its breadth, it requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; provided that it covers an area equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits.&quot;, &quot;3. A porch, that is a place with three walls and a roof, even though it has two uprights on the fourth side does not need a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; the uprights serving to support the roof and not as doorposts. Thus too, a roof without walls that rests on pillars on either side, even if it presents the appearance of a dwelling is exempt from the obligation of having a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; on account of its having no doorposts\\\\u2014the pillars having been erected to support the roof.&quot;, &quot;4. A dwelling with posts on either side (of the door), and in the place of the lintel an arch in the shape of a bow, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; provided that the posts are ten hand-breadths high or more. If they are not ten hand-breadths high, there is no such obligation, as the dwelling has no lintel.&quot;, &quot;5. A dwelling without a roof does not require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Where part of it is covered with a roof and part uncovered, it seems to me that if the portion over the entrance is roofed, the structure requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; After the doors are set up, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is affixed.&quot;, &quot;6. The Temple Mount, its chambers and courts, synagogues and houses of study which have no residences are exempt, because they are sacred. A village synagogue in which transients lodge requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; So too, a city synagogue which has a dwelling house attached to it, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; None of the Temple entrances had a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; except the Gate of Nikanor, and the gate within that gate, and the entrance to the Chamber of Parhedrin, because this chamber was the High Priest\\\&#39;s residence during his seven days of seclusion (prior to the Day of Atonement).&quot;, &quot;7. A hayloft, a cattle-shed, a wood store and a barn are exempted from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because of the phrase, \\\\&quot;thy house\\\\&quot; (in the text \\\\&quot;thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house\\\\&quot;), which means a dwelling assigned to thy use and excludes the aforementioned and similar classes of buildings. Hence, a cattle-shed, where women stay adorning themselves, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because it also serves as a human habitation. A lodge or porch\\\\u2014either rectangular or circular\\\\u2014leading to a garden, a garden and a sheepfold are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because they are not constructed to serve as residences. If dwellings requiring a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; open to these places, the latter must also have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;8. Hence, entrances, whether leading to courtyards or to passages, and gates of districts or cities, must each have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because dwellings which require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; open on to them. Even where ten rooms open one to the other, each requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; just as the innermost room requires it. This is the reason for the rule that a gate opening from the garden to a courtyard requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;9. A privy, bath-house, ritual bath-house, tannery and similar places are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; because they are not erected to serve as dwellings for honored use. The tabernacle for the feast of Tabernacles, and a room in a ship are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; because they are not made for permanent occupancy. Of two potter\\\&#39;s booths, one leading to the other, the exterior is exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because it is not permanent. Shops in market places are exempt, because they are not intended to be used as residences.&quot;, &quot;10. A dwelling with several doors, although only one is regularly used for coming in and going out, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; affixed to each door. A small door between a dwelling (below) and the attic needs a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Every room in a dwelling, even a room within a room, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; at the entrance of the inner chamber, of the outer chamber and of the house, for they all serve the purpose of residence and are permanent.&quot;, &quot;11. A door between a house of study or synagogue and a private house, if used habitually for entering and leaving, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If a door is between two dwellings, the position of the hinge determines the side on which the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is to be fixed. The side on which the hinge is visible is regarded as the dwelling in reference to which the position of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is decided.&quot;, &quot;12. Where is the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; to be fixed? Within the width of the doorpost, a hand-breadth from the external edge at a height of a third of the elevation of the entrance, counting from the top. If placed higher it is fit in position, provided that it is a hand-breadth lower than the lintel. It should be fixed on the right side of one entering; if placed on the left side, it is unfit for use. A house owned by partners requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;13. A person should pay heed to the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah;&lt;/i&gt; for it is an obligation perpetually binding upon all. Whenever one enters or leaves a home with the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on the doorpost, he will be confronted with the Declaration of God\\\&#39;s Unity, blessed be His holy name; and will remember the love due to God, and will be aroused from his slumbers and his foolish absorption in temporal vanities. He will realize that nothing endures to all eternity save knowledge of the Ruler of the Universe. This thought will immediately restore him to his right senses and he will walk in the paths of righteousness. Our ancient teachers said: He who has phylacteries on his head and arm, fringes on his garment and a Mezuzah on his door may be presumed not to sin, for he has many monitors\\\\u2014angels that save him from sinning, as it is said, (Psalms 34:8) \\\\&quot;The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them\\\\&quot;.&quot;], [&quot;1. It is an affirmative precept binding upon every individual Israelite to write a scroll of the Law for his own use, as it is said, \\\\&quot;Now therefore write ye this Song for you\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:19). As the Torah is not written in separate sections, this text means, \\\\&quot;Write for yourselves the Torah in which this Song is contained.\\\\&quot; Even if one\\\&#39;s ancestors have left a person a scroll, it is a religious duty to write a scroll at his own expense. If he wrote it with his own hand, it is accounted to him as if he had received it from Sinai. If one does not know how to write a scroll, he should get others to write it for him. He who corrects a scroll, even a single letter of it, is regarded as if he had written it completely.&quot;, &quot;2. A king has the duty of writing for himself another scroll of the Law, in his capacity as sovereign, in addition to the scroll which he owns in his private capacity, as it is said, \\\\&quot;And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law, etc.\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:18). This copy is corrected by comparison with a scroll kept in the temple court, and under the authority of the Supreme Judicature. The scroll which the king had possessed when he was a private individual, he places in his archives. The one that he wrote or had written for him when he became king, should always be with him. If he goes to war, the scroll is to be with him. When he enters his home, it is to be with him. When he hears a cause (tries a case) it is to be with him. When he sits down to a meal, it is to be placed before him, as it is said, \\\\&quot;And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:19).&quot;, &quot;3. If he possessed no scroll before he came to the throne, he has to write, after his accession, two scrolls of the law, one of which he places in his archives, while the other is to be always with him. It must never be away from him, except at night, or when he goes to the bath or the lavatory or lies down on his couch to sleep.&quot;, &quot;4. A scroll of the Law that has been written without having been ruled, or that has been written partly on parchment made of whole hide and partly on that made of the inner half of split hide is unfit for use. It must be entirely written either on the former or on the latter. How is a scroll of the law to be written? The scribe is to use the correct script and it should also be exceedingly fine. Between one word and another, he is to leave the space of a small letter; between one letter and another (in the same word) the space of a hair\\\&#39;s breadth; between one line and the next the space of a line. The length of each line is to be thirty letters, wide enough to write the word Le-Mi-Sh-Pe-Ch-O-S-E-Che-M&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*Ten consonant letters printed here in capital letters. See also below.&lt;/i&gt; three times. This is to be the width of each column. No line shall be shorter, so that the column shall not look like an epistle. Nor should any line be wider so that the reader\\\&#39;s eyes should not have to wander across the sheet.&quot;, &quot;5. He should not diminish the size of the characters in order to leave a space between one paragraph and another. When he comes (at the end of a line) to a word of five letters, he must not write two within the column and three outside the column; but he is to write three letters within the column and two outside the column. If there is not enough space left at the end of the line to write three letters, he is to leave it blank and begin at the commencement of the next line.&quot;, &quot;6. If at the end of a line, he has a word of two letters to write, he may not place it between the columns (that is, outside the column) but he writes it at the beginning of the next line. If, before the line is filled up, he has a word of ten letters, more or less, to write and there is not enough space left on the line to write it all within the column, if he is able to write half the word within the column and half outside the column, he may do so. If he cannot do this, he leaves the space blank and writes the word at the beginning of the next line.&quot;, &quot;7. Between each book and the next, he leaves a space of four lines, no more and no less, blank without any writing, and starts the next book at the beginning of the fifth line. When completing the Torah, he is to finish it in the middle of the line at the end of the column. If several lines of the column would be left, he shortens the lines, so as to begin at the beginning of the last line of the column and not complete it, and also so plans the lines that the final words &lt;i&gt;Le-\\\\u00e9n\\\\u00e9 Chol Yisrael&lt;/i&gt; (\\\\&quot;in the sight of all Israel\\\\&quot;) shall be in the middle of the line at the end of the column.&quot;, &quot;8. He should pay careful attention to the letters that are written large or small, to the letters that are punctuated with dots above them, to the letters that are written differently to the others, such as the letter P\\\\u00e9 and the letters that are curved, in the way the scribes have carried on the tradition. He is to pay attention to the tittles&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*lines over each of the letters &lt;i&gt;Shin, Ayin, Teth, Nuen, Zayin, Gimel, Tzadi&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; and the number of them in each case\\\\u2014one letter having above it a single tittle, another having seven tittles. All the tittles have the shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; and are to be thin as a hair.&quot;, &quot;9. All these provisoes are only stated in order that the duty of writing a scroll shall be observed in the most perfect way. If, however the scribe made changes in the method here set forth, was not careful in regard to the tittles, writing however all the letters correctly, or if he wrote the lines close together or far apart, extended the lines or shortened them\\\\u2014since he did not join any letter to another, omit aught or add aught, mar the form of any letter, nor make any variation in regard to which paragraphs should be open and which closed, the scroll is fit for use.&quot;, &quot;10. There are other rules mentioned in the Talmud which the scribes observe as a tradition handed down from one to another. They are as follows: The number of lines in each column shall not be less than forty-eight and not more than sixty; the blank spaces between one section and another shall be such that nine letters, e.g., A She R, A She R, A She R, can be written in it. The five lines preceding the Song at the Red Sea (Exodus 14:28, 29, 30, 30, 31) shall begin respectively with the words &lt;i&gt;Habaim, Bayabashah, Hashem, Mes, Bemitzraim.&lt;/i&gt; The five lines after it shall begin respectively with the words &lt;i&gt;Vatikach, Achareha, Sus, Vayetz\\\\u00eb\\\\u00fc, Vayav\\\\u00f6\\\\u00fc&lt;/i&gt; (Exodus 15:20, 20, 21, 22, 23). The six lines before the Song of Moses beginning &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) shall respectively commence with the words &lt;i&gt;Veaeedah, Achar\\\\u00e9, Haderech, Beacharith, Lehacheeso, Kehal&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 31:28, 29, 29, 29, 29, 30); and the five lines after the Song of Moses shall begin with the words &lt;i&gt;Vayabo, Ledabber, Asher, Hazoth, Asher&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:44, 45, 46, 46, 47). All these points of observance are to enable us to fulfill the duty in the best way. Variations in these particulars do not render the scroll unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;11. But if the scribe wrote &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; a word that should be &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or vice versa; or a word traditionally pronounced differently to the way it is written, according to the traditional pronunciation, for example, if he wrote &lt;i&gt;Yishkevenoh&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Yishgelenoh,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Oovatechorim&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Oova-apolim,&lt;/i&gt; etc.; or if he wrote an \\\\&quot;open\\\\&quot; section as if it were a closed section or vice versa; or if he wrote one of the Songs like the ordinary prose text, or an ordinary section in the form of one of the Songs, the scroll is unfit for use as a scroll of the Law. It has not the sacredness of a scroll of the Law, but is like any one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught.&quot;, &quot;12. A scroll of the Law, which has not been examined for correctness may not be kept longer than thirty days. It must either be corrected or segregated.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*put away and not be used.&lt;/i&gt; A scroll of the Law which has three errors in each column should be corrected. If there are four, it must be put away. If the greater portion has been found to be correct, and the remainder has four errors in each column, but there is even one column in this erroneous portion with less than four errors, corrections could be made.&quot;, &quot;13. This rule only applies to cases where the scribe wrote &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; words that should be written &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; so that he would be under the necessity of inserting the letters that he forgot between the lines. But if he wrote &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; words that are &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; even if every column contains several errors, he corrects them, as he only erases and does not have to insert letters between the lines.&quot;, &quot;14. It is permitted to write the Pentateuch, each book in a separate scroll. These scrolls have not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law that is complete. One may not however write a scroll containing some sections. Such a scroll may not be written for a child\\\&#39;s instruction. This is permitted, however, where there is the intention to complete the remainder of the book. If one wrote such a scroll with three words on each line, this is permitted.&quot;, &quot;15. The Pentateuch, the Prophets and the Hagiography may be put together in one volume. In such a case, a space of four lines is left blank between each book of the Pentateuch and the next; a space of three lines between each of the major Prophets and the next; and a space of three lines between each of the twelve minor prophets and the next, so that he can, if he wishes, separate any book. The order of the prophetical books is as follows: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah, the Twelve Minor Prophets. The order of the books of the Hagiography is: Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel, Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.&quot;, &quot;16. None of The Holy Scriptures may be written except on ruled lines, even if they are written on paper: Three words of Scripture may be written without ruling the line, but to write more is forbidden. A volume containing the Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiography has not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, but of a single book of the Pentateuch. The scroll which contains more than the entire Pentateuch is in the same class as that which contains less than the entire Pentateuch, on the principle that excess is similar to deficiency.&quot;], [&quot;1. The &lt;i&gt;open&lt;/i&gt; section has two forms. If the previous section ended in the middle of a line, the scribe leaves the remainder of the line blank and commences the open section at the beginning of the next line. This only applies to the case where, after the conclusion of the previous section, there is left sufficient space on the line to write nine letters. But if the space left is less, or if the previous section was completed at the end of the line, the next line must be left blank, and the open section is begun at the commencement of the third line.&quot;, &quot;2. A &lt;i&gt;closed&lt;/i&gt; section has three forms. If the previous section ended within the line, the scribe leaves a blank space for the required dimension (enough to write nine letters) and begins the closed section at the end of the line, provided that there is a blank space between it and the preceding section. If the completion of the previous section did not leave space for the blank of the required breadth and for writing (at least) one word at the end of the line, the scribe should leave the remainder of the line blank, leave a little space at the beginning of the next line blank, and begin the closed section within the line. If the previous section ended at the close of the line, he leaves a blank space of the required breadth (nine letters), at the beginning of the next line, and begins to write the closed section within the line. Hence, you may say that an open section always begins within the line.&quot;, &quot;3. A scroll which is inaccurate in regard to words that are written &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; can be made good by being corrected, as already explained. But if the scribe made a mistake in the spacing between the sections, and wrote an open section as if it were a closed section, or a closed section as if it were an open section or left a space where a section does not end, or continued writing without leaving a space where a section ends, or deviated from the form in which the Songs are written, in all these cases, the Scroll is unfit for use and there is no remedy except to remove the entire column in which the mistake occurs.&quot;, &quot;4. As in all the scrolls I have seen, I noticed serious incorrectness in these regards, while authorities on the Massorah, who write treatises and compilations with the aim of pointing out the sections that are closed and those that are open, differ according to the variations in the scrolls on which they rely, I deemed it fit to write here a list of the sections which are closed and those which are open, as also the forms in which the Songs of the Pentateuch are written so that all the scrolls may be corrected from, and compared with them. The copy on which I relied is the well-known Egyptian codex which contains the twenty-four books of the Scriptures and which had been in Jerusalem for several years\\\\u2014used as the standard text for the examination of scrolls. Everyone relied upon it because it had been examined by Ben Asher who closely studied it for many years and examined it again whenever it was being copied. This codex was the text on which I relied in the scroll of the Law that I wrote according to the rules.&quot;, &quot;(Here follow lists of open and closed sections which are in the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 131b to 136b.)&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF GENESIS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 43; of closed sections 48; total 91.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF EXODUS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 69; of closed sections, 95; total 164.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 52; of closed sections, 46; total 98.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF NUMBERS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 92; of closed sections, 66; total 158.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections of this book is 34; of closed sections, 124, total 158. The number of open sections in the entire Pentateuch is 290; of the closed sections, 379; total 669.&quot;, &quot;The form of the Song &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43). Every line has a blank space in the middle, like that preceding a closed section. Hence, every line is divided into two parts. The song is written in 70 lines. The words at the beginning of the lines are as follows:&quot;, &quot;(See the Hebrew text on the right hand side page 136a)&quot;, &quot;All these are the words at the beginning of the lines. And the following are the words at the beginning of the latter half of the line which are in the middle of the column.&quot;, &quot;(See the Hebrew text on the right hand pages 136a and 136b)&quot;, &quot;The Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15:1-19) is written in thirty lines, the first line in the ordinary way; the other lines, one with a blank space in the middle, the next with blank spaces in two places, so that the line is divided into three parts and so a blank space corresponds to writing (above and below it) and vice versa as follows.&quot;, &quot;See the Hebrew text on the right-hand side 136a, 136b and 137a as it should be written in the scroll. The English pages should be blank.&quot;, &quot;Throughout the Torah, in the Songs as well as in the rest of the text, the scribe should aim to write all the letters of each word close together, taking care that no letter should be joined to another, and that no letter should be so far away from the next as to make the word seem two words. The interval between the letters in one word should be a hairbreadth. If the scribe wrote one letter so far apart from the other that it would appear to a child who is not familiar with the text like two words, the scroll is unfit for use till he makes the correction.&quot;], [&quot;1. The length of a scroll of the Law should not exceed the circumference, nor should the circumference exceed the length. What is a suitable length? Where parchment of a whole hide is used, six hand-breadths, that is twenty-four finger-breadths taking the thumb as the standard. Where the parchment of the external half of the hide is used, the length may be more or less than this dimension, provided only that the length is equal to the circumference. So also in the case of parchment of a whole hide, if the scribe made the length less than six hand-breadths and wrote in a small hand or longer than six handbreadths and spread out the writing so that the length of the column is equal to the circumference\\\\u2014this too is correct.&quot;, &quot;2. The extent of the lower margin is four finger-breadths; of the upper margin, three finger-breadths; between one column and another, two finger-breadths. Hence, on the right and left of every sheet of parchment, the scribe has to leave a margin a finger-breadth wide and enough beside for sewing; so that, when the sheets are sewn together, there will be throughout the scroll a blank space of two finger-breadths between the columns. The scribe must leave in addition enough margin at the beginning and end of the scroll to fold a blank column round the rollers. All these dimensions are to be observed in order to fulfill the precept properly. But if the scribe exceeded or fell short of them, he does not render the scroll unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;3. How shall one proceed so that the length of the scroll shall turn out equal to its circumference. The parchment sheets are made evenly rectangular; each sheet being six handbreadths wide, all of the same dimensions. They are rolled evenly into one bundle tightly rolled up. And skins are added and tightly rolled till the circumference is six handbreadths, which is the width of the sheets. This is measured with a thread of wool which is placed round the bundle.&quot;, &quot;4. The scribe then fashions a straight ruler, forty or fifty finger-breadths long; one of these finger-breadths, he marks in two, three and four equal parts so as to be able to measure off a half, a third and a quarter of a finger-breadth and similar fractions. With this, he measures each sheet, so as to ascertain the number of finger-breadths it contains and so determine how many finger-breadths there are in the entire bundle.&quot;, &quot;5. He then takes two or three other sheets of parchment, to test the size of the characters, and writes on them one column. The length of a column of writing is obviously seventeen finger-breadths as a margin must be left, of three finger-breadths above and four finger-breadths below. The width of the column will depend on the handwriting, whether it is large or small. So also, the number of lines will vary according to the handwriting, as between each line and the next, the space of a line must be left.&quot;, &quot;6. Having written the column which he uses as a test as he pleases, he measures its breadth by means of the finger-breadths of the ruler, and adds two finger-breadths for the margin between column and column. He then calculates how many columns of such writing would fill the sheets in the bundle he had made up. Having ascertained the total number of columns, he will then see how much of the entire Pentateuch is in the column which he wrote as a test. He will make the estimate with the aid of the scroll which serves him as a copy, and calculate accordingly. If the number of columns of the kind of writing which he wrote is sufficient for the whole Torah\\\\u2014well and good. If the calculation showed that there are more columns than are required for the whole Torah, he will enlarge the writing, so as to diminish the number of columns, and he will make a test with another column. If the calculation shows that for the writing of the Torah more columns will be required than are contained in his sheets, he will use smaller characters and so secure a larger number of columns. He will make the test with column after column till the calculation comes out exact.&quot;, &quot;7. Once he knows the width of the column and the size of the characters, he can begin writing the scroll with that bundle of sheets. He then divides the parchment (sheets) into columns by ruling them off,\\\\u2014each column of the same width as that which his tests and calculations showed to be the right size. If three or four finger-breadths are left over beyond the last column, he should leave one finger-breadth and enough besides for sewing the sheet to the next, and cut off the rest, and need feel no apprehension, for at the end, more sheets will be added to make up for the superfluous strips that he cut off from each sheet. Nor need he make any calculations in regard to this, for the writing will be according to the number of columns.&quot;, &quot;8. So too, if one wishes to make the width of the scroll more or less than six handbreadths, he makes his calculation in the same way; and the length will be exactly equal to the circumference neither more nor less, provided that no mistake has been made in the calculation.&quot;, &quot;9. The finger-breadth in all the dimensions here and in the rest of the Torah is that of the medium sized finger. On careful examination, we find it to be the breadth of seven medium sized barley corns placed close together, this being equal to the length of two barley corns measured liberally. The handbreadth, wherever mentioned, is equal to four such finger-breadths. A cubit is six handbreadths.&quot;, &quot;10. The scroll which I wrote had a width of four finger-breadths to each column. The columns containing the Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15.1-18) &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) were each six finger-breadths wide. The number of lines in each column were fifty-one. The number of columns in the whole scroll were 226 columns. The length of the entire scroll was 13366 finger-breadths approximately.&quot;, &quot;11. The six finger-breadths left over were for the margin at the beginning and end of the scroll. The parchment skins on which we wrote were ramskins. Whenever you desire to write a scroll and follow these measurements completely or approximately, you need not weary yourself to make a calculation if you have one, two or three columns less or more; you will find that the length will be equal to the circumference.&quot;, &quot;12. No sheet should have less than three, nor more than eight columns. If a sheet is wide enough to contain nine columns, it is cut into two parts, one to contain four columns, the other to contain five columns. This rule applies to the beginning and middle of the scroll. But at the close, even if there is only left one verse to write on a column, that column is prepared on a separate sheet and sewn on to the other sheets.&quot;, &quot;13. For sewing the sheets together, only the sinews of a clean beast domestic or wild, including those that are &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt; (literally torn), flesh of a beast that had suffered from a mortal lesion.&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\\\u2014flesh of a beast that had died or had not been slaughtered, or had been slaughtered by an unqualified or disqualified person.&lt;/i&gt; may be used. The law here is the same as in regard to phylacteries. This rule goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. Hence if the sheets have been sewn together but not with sinews or with sinews of an unclean animal, the scroll is unfit for use till the stitches are taken out and the sewing is done according to rule.&quot;, &quot;14. When the sheets are sewn together, they are sewn entirely from top to bottom, but a small portion is left above and below without being stitched, so that the scroll, when it is rolled up, may not be torn in the middle. Two wooden rollers are prepared, one for either end. The unwritten margins of parchment at the beginning and at the end are brought round the rollers and sewn with sinews, so that the scroll can be rolled over them; a clear space being left between the margin and the writing in the columns.&quot;, &quot;15. In case a scroll of the law had one of its sheets torn, the rent is sewn up, if it extends to two lines; if it extends to three lines, it is not sewn up. This rule applies to a scroll the gall dressing of which is no longer perceptible. But if the parchment still shows that it has been dressed, then, even when the rent extends to three lines, it is sewn up. So too, a rent between columns or between words is sewn up. For the stitching of the rents, the same kind of sinews are used as for the sheets. And wherever there is a rent, the scribe should make sure that no letter is missing or altered in form.&quot;], [&quot;1. You thus find that there are twenty factors, any one of which disqualifies a scroll of the law. If any of these occurs, the scroll is like one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught. It does not possess the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, and is not used for reading in public worship. They are as follows:&quot;, &quot;1) If it was written on the skin of a beast of an unclean species;&quot;, &quot;2) or on the skin of a beast of a clean species, which had not been tanned;&quot;, &quot;3) If the skin had been tanned but not for the express purpose of being used as a scroll of the law;&quot;, &quot;4) If it was written on the wrong side; in the case of parchment of whole hide on the side next to the flesh; in the case of parchment of the outer half of a split hide, on the side adjacent to the hair;&quot;, &quot;5) If it was written partly on parchment of whole hide and partly on that made of the outer half of split hide;&quot;, &quot;6) If it was written on the inner half of a split hide;&quot;, &quot;7) If it was written without the lines having been previously ruled;&quot;, &quot;8) If it was written with a dark writing fluid that does not make a permanent impression;&quot;, &quot;9) If it was written in other languages;&quot;, &quot;10) If it was written by a heretic (Epikouros) or other disqualified persons;&quot;, &quot;11) If the scribe wrote the names of God without special concentration of mind;&quot;, &quot;12) If a single letter was omitted;&quot;, &quot;13) If a single letter was added;&quot;, &quot;14) If one letter touched another;&quot;, &quot;15)\\\\tIf a single letter was so marred that it cannot be read at all, or resembles another letter, whether the defect is in the writing, or is due to a perforation, rent or smudge;&quot;, &quot;16)\\\\tIf the scribe wrote letters so far apart or so closely together that one word looks like two words or two words look like one word;&quot;, &quot;17)\\\\tIf he altered the form of the sections&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\\\&quot;footnote\\\\&quot;&gt;*Wrote an \\\\u201copen\\\\u201d section as if it were a \\\\u201cclosed\\\\u201d section or vice versa.&lt;/i&gt;;&quot;, &quot;18)\\\\tIf he varied the form of writing the Songs;&quot;, &quot;19)\\\\tIf he wrote any other portion in the form of a Song;&quot;, &quot;20)\\\\tIf he did not sew the sheets with sinews of a beast of a clean species.&quot;, &quot;The other conditions stated are recommended as the best way of performing the duty of writing a scroll. Their non-observance does not render it unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;2. A scroll of the law that is fit for use is to be regarded as an object of extreme holiness and treated with great reverence. A person is forbidden to sell a scroll of the law even if he has nothing to eat, and even if he owns other scrolls. He may not even sell an old scroll, to buy a new one. A scroll may only be sold for one of two purposes, to provide means to enable one to study Torah or to marry\\\\u2014and then only if the owner has nothing else that he can sell.&quot;, &quot;3. If a scroll of the law has become worn out or been otherwise rendered unfit for use; it is placed in an earthenware vessel and buried beside the remains of deceased scholars. This is the appropriate method of \\\\&quot;concealing\\\\&quot; it (putting it away). Folders of scrolls that have become worn out are used as shrouds for the dead (found on the road) whose interment is a duty binding on all. This is the appropriate method of \\\\&quot;concealing\\\\&quot; them.&quot;, &quot;4. A case specially made for a scroll of the law and in which it has been placed, bands around the scrolls, the chest or structure in which it is deposited even though the scroll is in its case, as also a bench specially made on which to place a scroll of the law, and on which a scroll was placed are all subsidiaries of that which is sacred, and may not be thrown away. When worn out or broken, they are \\\\&quot;put away\\\\&quot;. The platforms, however, on which the Reader of the congregation stands and holds the scroll and tablets on which (scriptures) are written for a child\\\&#39;s instruction have no sanctity. Golden and silver pomegranates and other such ornaments, made for the embellishment of a scroll of the law are subsidiaries of that which is sacred; and it is forbidden to part with them to be used for secular purposes, unless they were sold with the intention to purchase with their proceeds a scroll of the law or a book of the Pentateuch.&quot;, &quot;5. It is permitted to place one scroll of the law upon another scroll, or, needless to add, upon single books of the Pentateuch. Single books of the Pentateuch may be placed upon books of the Prophets or Hagiography. But the books of the prophets and of the Hagiography are not placed upon single books of the Pentateuch; nor the latter on a scroll of the law. No sacred writings, not even Halachas or Hagadas (Legalistic or Homiletic works) may be thrown away. Amulets which contain scriptural matter, must not be taken with one into a lavatory (privy) unless they are covered with a skin.&quot;, &quot;6. A person may not, while bearing a scroll of the law in his arms, enter a bath-house, lavatory, or cemetery, even if the scroll is swathed in folders and placed in its case. A person must not read in it till he has moved away four cubits from the dead body (bath house) or lavatory. One may not hold a scroll of the law when nude. It is forbidden to sit down on a couch on which there is a scroll of the law.&quot;, &quot;7. Cohabitation is forbidden in a chamber where there is a scroll of the law, till it has been removed or placed in a receptacle which is itself placed in a receptacle not specially assigned to the scroll. If it has however been so assigned, even ten receptacles within each other, are regarded as a single receptacle. If a partition, ten handbreadths high, has been constructed for the scroll, cohabitation may take place if there is no other room. It may not take place, if there is another room, till the scroll has been removed.&quot;, &quot;8. All who are ritually unclean, even women in their menstruating period, and even a non-Israelite, may hold a scroll of the law and read in it, for the words of the Torah do not contract uncleanliness, provided that the holder\\\&#39;s hands are not dirty or soiled. They must therefore wash their hands and then they may touch it.&quot;, &quot;9. Every one who sees a person carrying a scroll of the law and proceeding with it must stand up before it; and all persons continue standing till the bearer of the scroll stops, having carried it to its appointed place, or passes out of sight. They are then permitted to resume their seats.&quot;, &quot;10. It is a duty to assign a fixed place for a scroll of the law, and to show it extreme honor and courtesy. The words in the tables of the covenant are in every scroll of the law. One may not expectorate before a scroll of the law, nor indecently expose oneself before it, nor stretch out one\\\&#39;s feet before it; nor place it upon the head in the way in which a burden is carried; nor turn one\\\&#39;s back to it unless it is at an elevation of ten handbreadths above the person.&quot;, &quot;11. If one is travelling from place to place and had a scroll of the law with him, he is not to put the scroll in a sack, place it on the donkey\\\&#39;s back and ride upon it. If, however, he is afraid of thieves, he may do so. When there is no such apprehension, he places it in his bosom close to his heart, and continues his journey, riding. Any one, sitting before a scroll of the law, should be inspired with a sense of earnestness, awe and reverence, for it is a faithful witness concerning all who come into the world, as it is said, \\\\&quot;It shall be therefore a witness against thee\\\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:26).

 u&#39;text&#39;: [[u&#39;1. The four Pentateuchal sections, beginning respectively, &quot;Sanctify unto me&quot; (Ex. 13:1-10), &quot;And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee&quot; (Exodus 13:11-16)\u2014these two being in the Book of Exodus, &quot;Hear, O Israel&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) &quot;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13-21), are written and covered with a skin. These are called &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; and are placed upon the head and bound on the arm. The omission of the point of a single letter in any one of these sections bars, according to Scriptural enactment, the use of all of them. They must all be written perfectly and in accordance with rule.&#39;,
            u&#39;2. This is the case also with the two sections of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; beginning respectively, &quot;Hear, O Israel&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) and &quot;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). If the point of a letter is missing in these two sections, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may not, according to Scriptural enactment, be used. The two sections must be written perfectly. So too, a scroll of the Law, in which a single letter is missing, is unfit for use.&#39;,
            u&#39;3. There are ten points in regard to &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; (phylacteries). The observance of each is enjoined by a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. The neglect of any of them is an absolute bar to the use of the &lt;i&gt;Tephillin.&lt;/i&gt; Hence, if there was a variation in any one of them, the &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; are unfit for use. Two of these have reference to the writing; eight, to the covering and the tying of the straps. The two points to be observed in the writing are that the sections must be written with ink, and must be written on parchment.&#39;,
            u&#39;4. How is the ink prepared? Soot of oils or of pitch, wax or similar substance is collected; kneaded with gum of trees and a little honey; thoroughly wetted and pounded till it is like wafers. It is then stored away. When the scribe wishes to write, he soaks it in water in which gall-apples or similar substances have been steeped, and with this fluid he writes. Such writing when erased leaves no mark. This is the best way to write scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs.&lt;/i&gt; If the scribe has written with fluid of the gall-oak or of caper,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*Caper: flower-buds or seeds of a low shrub of Mediterranean countries, used as a condiment.&lt;/i&gt; since the writing stays and is not rubbed out, scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; so written are fit for use.&#39;,
            u&#39;5. This being so, what is excluded by the Halacha, dating back to Moses, which ordains that these must be written with ink? It excludes pigments of other colors, such as red or green, etc.; so that if even a single letter in a scroll of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; was written with pigment of any other color [but black] or with gold, such a Scroll, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use.&#39;,
            u&#39;6. There are three kinds of parchment, &lt;i&gt;Gewil, Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Duxustus.&lt;/i&gt; How are these made? A hide of domestic cattle or wild beast is taken. First, its hair is removed. It is then pickled in salt, afterwards prepared with flour and subsequently tanned with gall-wood or similar materials which contract the pores of the hide and make it durable. And this it is that is called &lt;i&gt;Gewil&lt;/i&gt; (parchment of whole-hide leather).&#39;,
            u&#39;7. If, after removing the hair, the hide had been split through its thickness into two parts, so as to make of it two skins, one thin, namely that which had been next to the hair; the other thick, namely that which had been next to the flesh, and if these were prepared first with salt, then with flour and afterwards with gall-wood or similar substance the skin which had been next to the hair is called &lt;i&gt;Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; (= outer-skin parchment), and that which had been next to the flesh is called &lt;i&gt;Duxustus&lt;/i&gt; (inner-skin parchment).&#39;,
            u&#39;8. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that the scroll of the Law should be written on &lt;i&gt;Gewil&lt;/i&gt; (whole hide parchment), and the writing should be on the side which had been next to the hair. The &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; should be written on &lt;i&gt;Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; (the exterior part of the split hide) and the writing should be on the side which had been nearer the flesh; and the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; should be written on &lt;i&gt;Duxustus&lt;/i&gt; (made of the inner part of the split hide), on the side which had been nearer the hair. If, on a &lt;i&gt;Kelaf,&lt;/i&gt; one writes on the side that had been next to the hair, or, on a &lt;i&gt;Gewil or Duxustus,&lt;/i&gt; one writes on the side that had been next to the flesh, the Scroll, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; so written is unfit for use.&#39;,
            u&#39;9. Though this is the rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai, yet if one writes a scroll of the Law on parchment made from the exterior half of a split hide it is fit for use. The reason why a complete hide is mentioned is in order to exclude that made from the inner half of the split hide. If one wrote on it a scroll of the Law, it is unfit for use. So also, if one wrote a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on the external half of a split hide or on an undivided hide, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use. The inner half of a split hide is recommended to be used, only as a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (specially approved).&#39;,
            u&#39;10. Scrolls, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; are not written on the hide of a domestic or wild beast that is unclean or on the skin of an unclean bird. They are written on the hides of domestic or wild beasts that are clean or on the skins of clean birds, even when the flesh of these animals may not be eaten owing to their not having been slaughtered according to the ritual or being found to have suffered from a lesion of a mortal character. Nor are Scrolls, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; written on the skin of a fish, even if it be of a clean species, because of its foulness. For this is not removed by tanning.&#39;,
            u&#39;11. The undivided skin for a scroll of the Law, and the external half of the hide to be used for &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or for a scroll of the Law must be tanned for their specific purposes. If they were not expressly so tanned, they are not fit for use. Accordingly, if a non-Israelite or a Samaritan tanned them, they are unfit for use. Even if the Samaritan was instructed to tan a particular hide for the purpose of its being used for a scroll of the Law or &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; it is unfit for use; since he works with his own purposes in mind, not with those of his employer. Hence, anything that has to be done with a purpose in mind, if done by a Samaritan, is unfit for use. The skin for a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; does not require to be tanned for that express purpose.&#39;,
            u&#39;12. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that a scroll of the Law or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may only be written on parchment that is ruled. Phylacteries need not be ruled, because they are covered. So too, phylacteries and a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may be written from memory, as these sections are recited by and are familiar to everyone. But not a single letter may be written in a scroll of the Law, except from a written copy of the text.&#39;,
            u&#39;13. A scroll of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; written by a heretic must be burnt. If written by a Samaritan, by a Jew converted to another faith, by one who surrenders Israelites to tyrants, by a slave, woman or minor, they are unfit for use, and must be hidden; for it is said, &quot;And thou shalt bind them&quot;, &quot;And thou shalt write them&quot;. The implication is that only that person is qualified to write them, who is charged with the duty of putting on &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and believes in the obligation. If they are found in the possession of a heretic, and it is not known who wrote them, they should be hidden. If found in the possession of a Samaritan or non-Israelite, they are fit to be used. Scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; are not to be bought from non-Israelites for more than their value, so as not to accustom the latter to steal these holy articles or take them by force.&#39;,
            u&#39;14. A scroll of the Law, phylacteries or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth,&lt;/i&gt; written on the skin of a beast or bird\u2014whether domestic or wild\u2014which belongs to an unclean species, or written on skins that have not been tanned, and likewise a scroll of the Law or phylacteries written on skins not expressly tanned for those purposes, are unfit for use.&#39;,
            u&#39;15. If one who writes a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; had not concentrated his mind while writing, and wrote one of the Names of God without express intent, these articles are unfit for use. Accordingly, when one is writing the name of God, even if an Israelite king greets him, he must not return the greeting. If he is writing two or three names of God, he may pause between writing one and writing the others and may respond.&#39;,
            u&#39;16. After dipping the pen in ink to write the Name of God, the scribe does not start with a letter of the name but with a letter of the previous word. If he altogether forgot to write the name of God, he writes it above the line. But to write part of the name on the line and part above the line makes the scroll unfit for use. Other words that the scribe forgot to write may be written partly on the line and partly above it. These rules apply to a scroll of the Law. But in a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; or in phylacteries not a letter may be written above the line. If the scribe forgot even one letter, he must hide what he wrote and write a fresh slip. In all of them (Scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; and Phylacteries) it is permissible to write the name of God upon a surface from which writing has been erased or obliterated.&#39;,
            u&#39;17. Scribes of scrolls, phylacteries and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; are forbidden to turn over the parchment sheet with its written surface beneath touching the board on which it lies, but should cover it with a cloth or fold it.&#39;,
            u&#39;18. If, after a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; had passed out of the scribe\&#39;s hands, he makes the statement, &quot;I did not write the name of God in them with that purpose distinctly in mind&quot;, he is not believed to the extent of rendering them unfit for use, but his statement is accepted so far that he forfeits his entire remuneration. The reason why he is not believed so as to render them unfit for use is because his motive may possibly have been to cause a loss to the person who bought or hired them. It would seem however that his statement would only cause him to forfeit that quota of remuneration to which the writing of the names of God would entitle him. Hence, if he stated, &quot;the skins of this scroll of the Law or of these phylacteries were not expressly tanned for those purposes&quot;, then since in such a case he is believed so fully that he forfeits the whole of his remuneration, his statement is also credited so as to disqualify the articles from being used\u2014it being a matter of general knowledge that if the skins had not been expressly tanned for the purpose of being made into phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, the scribe receives no remuneration whatsoever.&#39;,
            u&#39;19. Phylacteries and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; may only be written in square Hebrew script. Permission was also given to write scrolls of the Law in Greek characters but not in those of any other foreign tongue. The ancient Greek script has gone out of use, been corrupted and become obsolete. Hence, at the present day, all three religious articles,\u2014Scroll of the Law, Tephillin and Mezuzah,\u2014are only written in the square Hebrew script. Care must be taken in writing that no letter shall adhere to any other letter; for any letter which is not completely surrounded on all four sides by a blank space of parchment has been improperly written. Any letter that cannot be read by a child of ordinary intelligence\u2014not particularly bright or dull\u2014is improperly written. Thus a &lt;i&gt;Yod&lt;/i&gt; must not be like a &lt;i&gt;Vav&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Vav&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Yod,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Koph&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Beth,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Beth&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Koph,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Daleth&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Resh,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Resh&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Daleth,&lt;/i&gt; etc., so that the reader may be able to read fluently.&#39;,
            u&#39;20. If the parchment was perforated, the scribe must not write on the perforation. A perforation over which the ink passes is not regarded as a perforation, and it is permitted to write across it. Hence, it is permitted to write on the skin of a bird that has been tanned. Should the parchment have become perforated, after it has been written on, if the perforation is in the interior of a letter, as, for example, in a &lt;i&gt;H\xe9&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mem,&lt;/i&gt; etc., it is regarded as properly written. Should one of the sides of a letter have been perforated, so that the letter is divided\u2014then the rule is that if there is left of the part that is unperforated as much as would form a small letter, it is regarded as properly written, provided that it does not resemble a different letter. If the part that is left unperforated is not as much as would form a small letter, it is not regarded as properly written.&#39;],
           [u&#39;1. How are the sections in the phylactery that is placed on the head to be written? The four sections are respectively written on four separate slips of parchment; each slip is rolled up separately and they are then placed in four compartments composed of one skin. As to the phylactery placed on the arm, these four sections are written in four columns on one slip of parchment. This slip is rolled up like a scroll of the Law from the last column to the first and is placed in one [leather] compartment.&#39;,
            u&#39;2. The scribe must exercise care in writing these sections, for if he wrote a closed section as an open one,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*that is, began the section on a new line where only a space of nine letters should have been left blank.&lt;/i&gt; or wrote an open section as if it were closed, the slip is unfit for use. The first three sections are, all of them, open. The last section, that beginning, &quot;And it shall come to pass, if ye will hearken diligently&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is closed.&#39;,
            u&#39;3. He must exercise care in regard to the words that are &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;**with or without a &lt;i&gt;Yod&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Vav,&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&lt;/i&gt; that all the four sections should be written as they are in an examined scroll of the Law. For if he wrote a word &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; that should have been written &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; the slip is unfit for use till the superfluous letter has been obliterated. If a word that is &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; has been written &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; the slip is unfit for use and cannot be made good. The following is the list of the words in these four sections that are &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&#39;,
            u&#39;[&lt;i&gt;For paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 (lists of&lt;/i&gt; plene &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; defective &lt;i&gt;words), see the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 121b and 122a&lt;/i&gt;.]&#39;,
            u&#39;6. The &lt;i&gt;Ayin&lt;/i&gt; of Shema and &lt;i&gt;Daleth&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Echad&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 6:4) are to be written in larger type.&#39;,
            u&#39;8. He must pay attention to the &quot;crowns&quot; (tittles) above the letters. These are like an upright &lt;i&gt;Zayin&lt;/i&gt; and are placed on each letter to which such a crown belongs as written in the scroll of the Law. The following are the letters in the four sections thus ornamented:&#39;,
            u&#39;9. In the first section, there is only one such letter, namely the closed &lt;i&gt;Mem&lt;/i&gt; in Meeyamim which has over it three &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. In the second section, there are five letters, each of them a &lt;i&gt;H\xe9;&lt;/i&gt; and on each, there are four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. These are the &lt;i&gt;H\xe9&lt;/i&gt; in Unesanah; the first and the last &lt;i&gt;H\xe9&lt;/i&gt; in Hikshah; the &lt;i&gt;H\xe9&lt;/i&gt; in Vayaharog; the &lt;i&gt;H\xe9&lt;/i&gt; in Yadchah.&#39;,
            u&#39;10. The third section has five such letters. The &lt;i&gt;Koof&lt;/i&gt; in Uvekoomecha has over it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines; the &lt;i&gt;Koof&lt;/i&gt; in Ukeshartam has over it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines; the two letters &lt;i&gt;Teth,&lt;/i&gt; and the letter &lt;i&gt;P\xe9&lt;/i&gt; in Letotaphoth have on each of them four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines.&#39;,
            u&#39;11. The fourth section has five such letters. The &lt;i&gt;P\xe9&lt;/i&gt; of Veasaphta has above it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. The &lt;i&gt;Tav&lt;/i&gt; of Veasaphta has one &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped line. The two letters &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; and the letter &lt;i&gt;P\xe9&lt;/i&gt; in Letotaphoth have on each of them four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. Altogether, the letters thus ornamented are sixteen. If the scribe wholly omitted these ornaments, added to them or omitted them over some of the letters, he has not rendered the phylacteries unfit for use.&#39;,
            u&quot;12. If one buys phylacteries from one who is not a recognized expert, he has to examine them. If he bought from him one hundred parchment slips, he examines three slips, either two of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the arm or two slips of those in the phylacteries worn on the arm and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head. If he found all these three correct, a presumption is established in the vendor&#39;s favour, and all his phylacteries are fit for use and the rest need not be examined. If he bought them however in several bundles, this examination (of three slips) must take place in each bundle, there being a presumption that the several bundles came from different individuals.&quot;,
            u&#39;13. A man who wrote phylacteries with his own hand or purchased them from an expert or, having bought them of a non-expert, examined them and replaced them in their leather containers, need never re-examine them, even after the lapse of many years. As long as the leather container remains sound, the presumption that they are sound holds good. Nor is it apprehended that a letter has been obliterated or perforated. Hillel the Elder was wont to say, &quot;These phylacteries belonged to my mother\&#39;s father.&quot;&#39;],
           [u&#39;1. There are eight rules for the making of phylacteries; all of them are traditionally ascribed to Moses who received them on Sinai; hence the observance of all of them is indispensable. A variation from any of them renders the phylacteries unfit for use. The rules are as follows: The phylacteries (that is, the external leather containers) must be square; they are to be sewn in such a way as to retain the square shape; their diagonals must be those of a square so that all the angles shall be equal; the leather container of the phylactery for the head shall have the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; embossed on the right and on the left side; each of the slips of parchment on which the sections from the Pentateuch are written is to be wrapt in a cover; this is to be tied with hair, and then the slips are placed in their respective compartments which are sewn up with sinews; a border with a fold open at both ends shall be made of the skin of the base for the strap to pass through freely; the straps shall be black, and have the special knot, that is known to all, in the shape of a &lt;i&gt;Daleth.&lt;/i&gt;&#39;,
            u&#39;2. How is the phylactery for the head made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length, breadth and height. It is of no consequence however if the height is more than the breadth or less. What is essential is that the length and breadth shall be equal. Three grooves are cut in the block so that it is divided into four parts as in this figure &lt;img src=&quot;data:image/jpg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEBLAEsAAD/2wBDAAUDBAQEAwUEBAQFBQUGBwwIBwcHBw8LCwkMEQ8SEhEP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\nClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUH//Z\n&quot;&gt;. A piece of leather is taken and soaked in water. The wooden block is put in it and the leather is inserted into each groove. While it is still damp, it is crinkled on both sides, to make a shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; with three lines on the right side of the wearer and with four lines on the left side.&#39;,
            u&#39;3. The leather is left on the wood till it dries; it is then slipped off from the wooden block, with the result that it has the shape of four compartments. The prescribed sections of Scripture written on slips of parchment are placed, one in each compartment. A portion of the leather is drawn round and beneath the cube (to form its base). This is sewn up at its four sides. A portion is left in this skin at the base for the strap to pass through as in a loop. This it is which is called the bridge.&#39;,
            u&#39;4. How are the phylacteries for the arm made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length and breadth. It is to be a finger-breadth in height, or a little more or less. The block is covered with wet leather which is left on till it dries. It is then removed, and in the place where the wood had been, a single slip of parchment on which the four prescribed sections of Scripture are written, is inserted. A portion of the leather is drawn round below and is sewn up at its four sides. Of this base a part is left to form a loop for the strap to pass through.&#39;,
            u&#39;5. What is the order in which the sections are placed in the phylactery for the head? The last section, that beginning, &quot;And it shall come to pass if ye will hearken diligently&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is placed in the first compartment, to the right of the wearer; the section beginning, &quot;Hear O Israel&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4) in the compartment adjacent to it; the section beginning, &quot;And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God will bring thee&quot; (Exodus 13:11), next to the one containing the section, &quot;Hear O Israel&quot;, and the section beginning, &quot;Sanctify unto me every first born&quot; (Exodus 13:1) in the fourth compartment which would be to the left of the wearer of the phylactery; so that anyone facing the wearer and reading what is before him would read the sections in the right Scriptural order as in the annexed figure. If there&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*Sections beginning with verse:&lt;/i&gt; was a deviation from this order, the phylacteries are not fit for use.&#39;,
            u&#39;6. The sections for the phylactery for the arm are written in four columns on one long strip of parchment like a scroll of the Law, and in the order in which they are found in the Pentateuch as in the annexed figure.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;**Sections beginning with verse:&lt;/i&gt; If the scribe wrote them on four separate slips and placed them in one compartment, he has done what is required, and need not attach them to each other.&#39;,
            u&#39;7. When he rolls up the parchment slips containing the sections, for the phylacteries worn on the head or on the arm, he rolls them from the end to the beginning so that, if opened, each section can be read from the beginning to the end.&#39;,
            u&#39;8. When the slips are about to be placed in their respective compartments, they are wrapped in a cloth, over which they are fastened with hair. They are then deposited in their compartments. This hair must be that of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species; and may even be taken from animals which are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;***&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;***&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\u2014died of itself or, by extension of meaning, not properly killed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;\u2020&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;\u2020&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;\u2014torn by wild beast; by extension of meaning, found to have suffered from mortal disease or lesion.&lt;/i&gt; The custom that has come into general use is to fasten the slips with hair taken from calves\&#39; tails.&#39;,
            u&#39;9. The leather receptacles of the phylacteries are only sewn with sinews of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species, and may be taken from animals of such species even if they are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\u2014died of itself or, by extension of meaning, not properly killed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;\u2014torn by wild beast; by extension of meaning, found to have suffered from mortal disease or lesion.&lt;/i&gt; The sinews used are those found in the heel of the domestic or wild beast, which are white and tough. They are softened by pounding them with stones or similar substances, till they become like flax. They are spun and twined, and then used for sewing the phylacteries and the sheets of the scrolls of the Law.&#39;,
            u&#39;10. The receptacles are to be sewn in such a way as to preserve the square contour of the base. It is a broadly established rule that on each side, there are to be three stitches, making altogether twelve stitches, whether the phylactery is for the arm or for the head. If the scribe desires to make ten or fourteen stitches, he may do so. The stitch must pass through the leather on both sides.&#39;,
            u&#39;11. The grooves of the phylacteries for the head ought to extend to the base where the stitching is done. If the grooves are recognizable so that the four divisions clearly appear, the phylacteries are fit for use, even though the grooves do not extend to the base. If however the grooves are not recognizable, the phylacteries are unfit for use. Within each groove, above the leather, a thread or cord ought to be passed so as to separate the compartments from each other. The general custom is to draw through each of the three grooves a sinew of the same kind as those used for the stitches.&#39;,
            u&#39;12. How are the thongs fixed? A strip of leather is taken as wide as the length of a barley corn. If wider, it is fit for use. The length of the strap of the phylactery for the head should be sufficient to encircle the head, form the knot and leave enough for the straps on either side to reach to the navel or a little higher. The strap for the phylactery of the arm should be sufficiently long to encircle the forearm, form the knot, extend down to the middle finger, about which it is to be wound three times and then fastened. If the straps exceed in length the foregoing dimensions, they are also fit for use.&#39;,
            u&quot;13. The thong of the phylactery for the head is inserted in the loop open at both ends. It is measured to fit the wearer&#39;s head, and then tied in a rectangular knot like a &lt;i&gt;Daleth.&lt;/i&gt; This knot, every scholar should learn how to make. It is impossible to teach its form by description; this can only be taught by ocular demonstration. In the case of the phylactery for the arm, the thong is tied in a knot in the shape of a &lt;i&gt;Yod.&lt;/i&gt; The thong of the phylactery for the arm should move freely in the loop, so that the wearer can loosen or tighten it when he puts it on his arm.&quot;,
            u&#39;14. The thongs of the phylacteries, whether for the head or for the arm, must have their exterior surface black. This is a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. But the other side of the thongs, being close to the skin, are fit for use if they are green or white. They must not however be red, for if the thong were inadvertently turned, the color of its lower surface would subject the wearer to ignominy. The lower side of the thongs should not be otherwise in color than the base of the leather case containing the parchment slips. If the latter is green, the former should be green; if white, the former should be white. It is comely if the phylacteries are wholly black, namely, both the case containing the slips of parchment and the thongs.&#39;,
            u&#39;15. The leather which forms the receptacles of the phylacteries and its thongs is to be made from the hide of a domestic or wild quadruped or skin of a fowl that belongs to the clean species, and may even be taken from those of these species that are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Terefah.&lt;/i&gt; If they were made of the skin or hide of unclean species, or if the phylacteries were covered with gold, the phylacteries are unfit for use. The leather for the thongs must be expressly tanned for their intended purpose to be thongs of phylacteries. The leather which forms the receptacles for the phylacteries need not be tanned. Even if it consists of raw hide it is fit for use. Many places have the custom to make them of raw hide.&#39;,
            u&#39;16. The receptacles of the phylacteries may not be prepared by any one but an Israelite; for the making of these is like the writing of the prescribed sections because of the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; which is embossed on the phylactery for the head, as we have already stated. Hence, if a non-Israelite made or sewed the phylacteries, they are unfit for use. So too, whoever is disqualified from writing the prescribed sections for the phylacteries may not prepare them.&#39;,
            u&#39;17. The phylactery for the head may not be transformed into a phylactery for the arm, but the latter may be changed into the former; on the principle that an object may not be degraded from a higher to a lower sacred use. So too, the thong of the phylactery for the head may not be transferred to a phylactery for the arm. This rule only applies to phylacteries that had been worn. But with regard to phylacteries for the head that no one had ever worn, if it is desired to transform them into phylacteries for the arm, this may be done. How is this effected? It is covered with leather so that it appears as one receptacle. The phylactery may then be bound on the arm.&#39;,
            u&#39;18. In case the stitches of the phylacteries are broken, they become unfit for use if there are two broken stitches adjacent to each other, or three not adjacent. This rule applies to old phylacteries. New phylacteries are fit for use as long as they keep their surface unimpaired. The following would be called new. If, at the place where the stitches have given way, part of the leather is held in the hand so that the phylactery is suspended, and the leather is strong enough not to be further torn, such phylacteries would be regarded as new. If however the leather is not strong enough to bear the weight of the phylacteries so suspended, but would tear, such phylacteries are regarded as old.&#39;,
            u&#39;19. A thong that has become broken is not to be tied together nor sewn up; but it is to be removed, put away, and replaced by a new thong. The parts of the broken thong are unfit for use unless the length and breadth of the part is of the prescribed dimension or larger. Care should always be taken that the external surface of the thongs should be above, when the phylacteries are bound on the hand or round the head. End of the chapter.&#39;],
           [u&quot;1. Where is the phylactery of the head placed? It is placed on that part of the crown of the head, where the hair adjacent to the forehead ends, and this is the place where an infant&#39;s brain pulsates (the fontanelle). The phylactery needs to be adjusted so that it lies in the centre of the forehead, in a line with the point between the eyes. The knot should be at the top of the back of the neck, which is the end of the skull.&quot;,
            u&#39;2. The phylactery of the hand is bound on the left arm over the biceps muscle which is the flesh that stands out on the upper arm that is intermediate between the shoulder-blade and forearm, so that when the upper arm is held close to the ribs, the phylactery will be opposite the heart and thus the precept will be fulfilled, &quot;And these words \u2026 shall be upon thine heart&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:6).&#39;,
            u&#39;3. To lay the phylactery of the hand on the palm or that of the head on the forehead is the practice of the Sadducees. He who makes the phylactery round like a nut is not fulfilling the precept in any way. A left-handed person lays the phylactery on his right arm, used by him as his left. If one is ambidextrous, he lays it on his left arm, which is the same as the left arm of any other person. The places where the phylacteries are respectively bound and laid are known by tradition.&#39;,
            u&#39;4. The lack of a phylactery for the head does not preclude one from putting on that of the hand, nor does the lack of a phylactery of the hand preclude one from putting on that for the head. Each is a duty separate and independent. What blessings are recited? For the phylactery of the head, the formula is as follows: &quot;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and given us a command concerning the precept of phylacteries&quot;. For that of the hand, the form is as follows: &quot;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to lay the phylacteries&quot;.&#39;,
            u&#39;5. This rule applies to the case where a person puts on one phylactery only. But when one lays both phylacteries, he recites one blessing, namely, the form, &quot;And hast commanded us to lay the phylacteries&quot;, binds the phylactery on his arm, and then puts on that for the head. When they are removed, that on the head is removed first, and afterwards that on the arm.&#39;,
            u&#39;6. When a person has recited the blessing, &quot;Who hast commanded us to lay phylacteries&quot;, and bound the phylactery on his arm, he is forbidden to converse, even to the extent of acknowledging his master\&#39;s greeting, till he has put on the phylactery of the head. If he conversed he has committed a transgression; and when putting on the phylactery for the head, he must recite another blessing, viz: the form, &quot;Who hast given us a command concerning the precept of the phylacteries&quot;, and then he puts on the phylactery for the head.&#39;,
            u&#39;7. On each occasion when one puts on phylacteries, the blessing is recited, even if they are removed and put on again several times in the day. It is a universal rule with regard to religious precepts that the appropriate blessings are recited prior to their performance. Hence too, the blessing for the phylactery of the hand has to be recited after it is placed on the biceps muscle before the thong is tightened, for the fastening constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.&#39;,
            u&#39;8. When a person removes his phylacteries, and puts them in a bag, he should not place the phylactery of the hand beneath and that for the head above it, because when he will again have occasion to put them on, he will come into contact with the phylactery of the head first, will thus be under the necessity of putting it down and take out the phylactery of the hand, the former not being put on before the latter. It is forbidden to leave a precept and pass on to the fulfillment of another religious duty, the rule being that the duty that first presents itself should first engage our attention. Hence, the phylactery for the hand should be placed above so that one may come into contact with it first, and the phylacteries be put on in the right order.&#39;,
            u&#39;9. A bag expressly intended to contain phylacteries and into which these have been placed, becomes consecrated and may not be put to secular use. If the bag was intended for this express purpose of containing phylacteries but had never contained them, or if phylacteries had been casually placed in a bag not set aside for that use, it does not become sacred, and continues to be a secular object as it had been hitherto. Phylacteries may not be suspended by their thong or by the part which contains the scriptural section. But the bag containing the phylacteries may be suspended.&#39;,
            u&#39;10. The proper time for putting on phylacteries is when it is day and not when it is night, for it is said, &quot;Day by day&quot;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*Usually rendered, \u201cfrom year to year\u201d, referring to observance of the feast of Passover.&lt;/i&gt; (Exodus 13:10). &quot;The ordinance&quot; mentioned in this verse refers to the precept of phylacteries. So it is said, &quot;And it shall be for a sign&quot;, while Sabbaths and festivals are them-also, Sabbaths and festivals are not seasons for putting on phylacteries, for selves a sign. When is the proper time in the day to put on phylacteries? At the hour when a person can see his neighbour at a distance of four cubits and recognize him. The period extends till sunset.&#39;,
            u&#39;11. A person who put on phylacteries before sunset, is permitted when it becomes dusk, to continue to wear them, even throughout the night. The multitude however is not to be so taught. Everyone should be instructed not to wear phylacteries at night, but to remove them at sunset. Whoever deliberately puts on phylacteries after sunset, violates a prohibition, for it is said, &quot;And thou shalt keep this ordinance in its season, day by day&quot; (Exodus 13:10).&#39;,
            u&#39;12. If the sun sets while a man with the phylacteries on his head was on the road, he places his hand upon the phylactery till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If Sabbath or a festival arrived while he was sitting in the house of study, with the phylactery on his head, he places his hand upon it till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If there is a house near the City Wall,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*the house of study was outside the town.&lt;/i&gt; where the phylacteries could be safely left, he should leave them there. If he did not remove them after sunset, because he had no place where they would be safe, and he kept them on for the sake of security, his conduct is lawful.&#39;,
            u&#39;13. One who is exempt from reading the &lt;i&gt;Shema&lt;/i&gt; is exempt from putting on phylacteries. If a child less than thirteen years of age knows how to take care of his phylacteries, his father purchases a set for him, so as to train him in the practice of religious precepts. Those who suffer intestinal troubles or have difficulty in controlling their sphincters are exempt from the obligation of putting on phylacteries. All who are ritually unclean are under the same obligation of putting on phylacteries as those who are ritually clean. One, who is in pain or whose mind is not calm and composed is exempt from the duty of putting on phylacteries; for the wearer must not allow his consciousness of them to wander. Priests while engaged in the temple service, Levites during the recital of hymns in their appointed places, Israelites while they are in the Sanctuary, are exempt from the duties of reciting the prayers and putting on phylacteries.&#39;,
            u&#39;14. As long as one is wearing phylacteries, he should frequently touch them with his fingers, so as not to lose consciousness of them for a single moment. For their degree of sanctity is higher than that of the golden plate which the High Priest wore on his forehead. On the latter, the name of God was engraved once only, while the phylactery for the head contains the tetragrammaton twenty-one times, and the phylactery for the arm, an equal number of times.&#39;,
            u&#39;15. A requisite in wearing phylacteries is physical cleanliness. One should take care that no flatus escapes him while he has them on. Hence, he may not, while wearing them, indulge in regular sleep or even doze. But if they are covered with a cloth, he may doze, even while wearing them. How so? He places his head between his knees and dozes in a sitting posture. If his phylacteries were folded and held in his hand, the holder may even sleep in the regular way.&#39;,
            u&#39;16. No meal, unless it be of a casual character, may be eaten, while one wears phylacteries (without previous preparation). Before proceeding to a regular meal, he removes them, places them on the table, washes his hands, puts them on again, recites the blessing for food while he has them on.&#39;,
            u&#39;17. If one feels a call of nature while wearing phylacteries, he is not to deposit them, before entering the lavatory, in the crevices that open towards the public thoroughfare, lest passers-by may take them. How should he act? Even if he needs to relieve the bladder while he is at a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, he should remove the phylacteries, roll them up in his garment, as a scroll is rolled up, grasp them in his right hand opposite his heart, taking care that not a thong projects outside his hand as much as a hand breadth; then he enters, relieves himself, and, after having left, goes away to a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, and puts on his phylacteries.&#39;,
            u&#39;18. This rule only applies to the case of a permanent lavatory. But one may not enter an extemporized lavatory with phylacteries even rolled up. They should be removed and given to another person for safe keeping.&#39;,
            u&#39;19. If one wearing phylacteries needed to go to the lavatory at eventide when there would be no more time to put them on again, he should not enter with the phylacteries rolled up in his garment, even to relieve his bladder, if the lavatory is a permanent one. How should he act? He should remove the phylacteries, place them in their bag which must be at least a hand breadth long, or even in a smaller bag provided it is not specially assigned as a receptable for phylacteries. This he keeps in his hand and enters. Thus, too, at night time, if he needs to visit the lavatory, he may put the phylacteries in a bag which he keeps in his hand when entering.&#39;,
            u&#39;20. Translation omitted.&#39;,
            u&#39;21. Translation omitted.&#39;,
            u&#39;22. One is permitted to put on phylacteries in that portion of a bathhouse where all are attired. In that portion where some are in their attire while others are nude, the phylacteries which one wears need not be removed, but they may not be put on. Where all are nude, the phylacteries must be removed, and needless to add, they may not be put on.&#39;,
            u&#39;23. A person should not walk in a cemetery with phylacteries on his head. When he is within a distance of four cubits from a corpse or a grave, the phylacteries are to be removed till he has passed on to a distance outside four cubits. Phylacteries must not be put on before one is decently covered and has put on his garments. If a person is carrying a burden on his head, he must remove the phylactery from his head, and may not put it on till he has removed the burden. Even a kerchief [alone] may not be put upon the head when one is wearing phylacteries. But he puts his cap over the phylactery.&#39;,
            u&#39;24. In a room where there are phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, marital intercourse may not take place, till these have been taken out, or placed in a receptacle which itself is enclosed in another receptacle not assigned to the use of phylacteries or a scroll of the Law. If the latter receptacle has been so assigned, and even if there be ten such receptacles, they are all regarded as one receptacle. If he placed the sacred articles in two receptacles, one within the other, they may be put for security under his pillow between the bolster and the coverlid\u2014not however exactly beneath his head. This may be done even if his wife shares his couch.&#39;,
            u&quot;25. The sanctity of phylacteries is a high degree of sanctity. As long as phylacteries are on a man&#39;s head and arm, he is humble and God-fearing, is not drawn into frivolity and idle talk, does not dwell on evil thoughts but occupies his mind with thoughts of truth and righteousness. A man should therefore endeavour to wear phylacteries the whole day, this being the right way of fulfilling the precept. It is said of &lt;i&gt;Rav,&lt;/i&gt; the disciple of our Sainted Teacher (R. Judah, the Prince), that throughout his life no one saw him, without Torah, Tzitzis (fringes on his garments) or phylacteries.&quot;,
            u&#39;26. Although the proper mode of fulfilling the precept is to wear phylacteries the whole day, it is especially a duty to do so during the recital of prayers. The sages say, &quot;Whoever reads the &lt;i&gt;Shema&lt;/i&gt; without wearing phylacteries is regarded as testifying falsely in his own person.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*He recites the Commandment to wear &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and does not fulfill it.&lt;/i&gt; Whoever does not wear phylacteries at all violates eight affirmative precepts, since in each of the four sections, the command is set forth to lay phylacteries on the head and on the arm. Whoever wears phylacteries regularly will be blessed with longevity, as it is said, \&#39;The Lord is upon them: they shall live\&#39;&quot; (Isaiah 38:16).&#39;],
           [u&#39;1. How is the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;**Sections of Scripture placed on doorposts.&lt;/i&gt; written? Two sections of the Pentateuch, those beginning, &quot;Hear, O Israel&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4) and, &quot;And it shall come to pass&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) are written in a single column on one slip of parchment. A space of half a nail\&#39;s breadth is left as a margin above and below the column. If the Pentateuchal sections were written in two or three columns, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use. They must not however be written in the shape of a tail (broad at the top line and gradually narrowing to a point), or of a circle, or of a tent (narrow at the top and broadening to the base). A &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; written in any of these forms is unfit for use. If the text was written out of order, for example, if the second section was in front of the first, it is unfit for use. If it was written on two slips of parchment, even though these were sewn together, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use. A Scroll of the Law that has become worn out or phylacteries that are worn out may not be used for a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Nor may margins cut off from a scroll of the Law be so used; for anything dedicated to a sacred purpose may not be degraded from a higher to a lower degree of sacredness.&#39;,
            u&#39;2. It is a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (an act of piety) to separate the section beginning, &quot;Hear, O Israel&quot; from that beginning, &quot;And it shall come to pass&quot; by a &quot;closed&quot; space (blank of nine letters). If the division between the two sections was an &quot;open&quot; one (the second section beginning a new line), the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use, as, in the Pentateuch, the second section does not immediately follow the first. Special heed should be paid to the tittles in the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; The following are the tittles which are made in the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&#39;,
            u&#39;3. In the first section, there are seven letters, each of which should have above it three upright lines in the shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Zain.&lt;/i&gt; They are the &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ayin&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Shema; Nun&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nafshecha;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Totafoth.&lt;/i&gt; The second section has six letters, each of which should have above it three &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. They are the &lt;i&gt;Gimel&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Degancha;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Totafoth;&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;Tzadi&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Ha-aretz.&lt;/i&gt; If the tittles were omitted or if they are more or less than those specified, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; has not been rendered unfit for use. But if it was written without the lines having been ruled, or if the scribe paid no heed to &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; letters, or if he added in the text even a single letter, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use.&#39;,
            u&#39;4. It is a universal custom to write the word &lt;i&gt;Shaddai&lt;/i&gt; (Almighty) on the other side of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; opposite the blank space between the two sections. As this word is written on the outside, the practice is unobjectionable. They, however, who write names of angels, holy names, a Biblical text or inscriptions usual on seals, within the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; are among those who have no portion in the world to come. For these fools not only fail to fulfill the commandment but they treat an important precept that expresses the Unity of God, the love of Him, and His worship, as if it were an amulet to promote their own personal interests; for, according to their foolish minds, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is something that will secure for them advantage in the vanities of the world.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*A reproof to those who sell Mezuzoth to be worn as amulets !&lt;/i&gt;&#39;,
            u&#39;5. It is a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (act of piety) to write &lt;i&gt;Al Ha-aretz&lt;/i&gt; (the last two words) on the last line, either at the beginning or in the middle of the line. All the scribes follow the custom of writing the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; in twenty-two lines, and (the last two words) &lt;i&gt;Al Ha-aretz&lt;/i&gt; at the commencement of the last line. The following are the words in order, which begin each of the lines: (See the Hebrew text on the corresponding right-hand side, page 127b.)&#39;,
            u&#39;6. When the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is folded, it is rolled up from the end of the line to the beginning, so that anyone opening it is able to read it from the beginning to the end of the line. After it has been rolled up, it is placed in a cylinder of reed, wood or other material, which is attached to the doorpost with a nail; or else a cavity is hollowed out in the doorpost, into which the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is inserted.&#39;,
            u&#39;7. Before one affixes it to the doorpost, he recites the blessing, &quot;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us to affix the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&quot;.&lt;/i&gt; No blessing is recited at the time when it is written, because the affixing of it constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.&#39;,
            u&#39;8. If one suspended it on a staff, it is unfit, for this is not affixing it (to the doorpost). If one placed it behind the door, he has not fulfilled the precept. If he perforated the door and forced the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; into it like a nail, as a bolt is inserted in the staple-ring, it is unfit. If it was placed in a hollow of the doorpost at a depth of a hand-breadth, it is unfit. If one cut a stick, put a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on it, attached this stick to other sticks and made of them all a doorpost, it is unfit, because the affixing of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; preceded the erection of the doorpost.&#39;,
            u&#39;9. The &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; of a private dwelling is examined once every seven years; that attached to a public building twice in the Jubilee (fifty years). The object is to ascertain whether a letter has been torn away or obliterated; because owing to the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; being affixed to walls, it is liable to decay.&#39;,
            u&#39;10. The fulfillment of the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is incumbent upon all Israelites, including women and slaves (of Israelites). Children under the age of thirteen years are trained to affix the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; to their rooms. One who rents a dwelling outside the Holy Land, or lodges at an inn in the Holy Land is exempt from the obligation of affixing a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; for a period of thirty days after beginning his occupancy. But if one rents a home in the Holy Land, the duty of affixing a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; devolves immediately.&#39;,
            u&#39;11. If one lets a dwelling to another person, the duty devolves upon the lessee to bring a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; and attach it, even if he has to pay for doing so, for the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is the personal obligation of the occupant and not an obligation attaching to the structure. When he surrenders possession, he must not, on quitting the premises, remove the Mezuzah. But if the owner is a non-Israelite, the Jewish tenant, when leaving, takes it away.&#39;],
           [u&#39;1. There are ten conditions which must exist in a dwelling, to put the occupant under an obligation to affix a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If one of these is absent, he is exempt. These are as follows: The dwelling must have a superficial area of four cubits by four cubits or more; it must have two door-posts, a lintel, a roof and doors; the entrance should be ten hand-breadths high or more; it must be a secular (not a sacred) structure; it must have been erected for human occupancy, for honored use (not a lavatory), and built for permanent habitation.&#39;,
            u&#39;2. A dwelling, the superficial area of which is less than four cubits by four cubits does not require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If its area is equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits, even if it is circular in shape or has five angles, or, needless to add, if its length is greater than its breadth, it requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; provided that it covers an area equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits.&#39;,
            u&#39;3. A porch, that is a place with three walls and a roof, even though it has two uprights on the fourth side does not need a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; the uprights serving to support the roof and not as doorposts. Thus too, a roof without walls that rests on pillars on either side, even if it presents the appearance of a dwelling is exempt from the obligation of having a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; on account of its having no doorposts\u2014the pillars having been erected to support the roof.&#39;,
            u&#39;4. A dwelling with posts on either side (of the door), and in the place of the lintel an arch in the shape of a bow, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; provided that the posts are ten hand-breadths high or more. If they are not ten hand-breadths high, there is no such obligation, as the dwelling has no lintel.&#39;,
            u&#39;5. A dwelling without a roof does not require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Where part of it is covered with a roof and part uncovered, it seems to me that if the portion over the entrance is roofed, the structure requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; After the doors are set up, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is affixed.&#39;,
            u&quot;6. The Temple Mount, its chambers and courts, synagogues and houses of study which have no residences are exempt, because they are sacred. A village synagogue in which transients lodge requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; So too, a city synagogue which has a dwelling house attached to it, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; None of the Temple entrances had a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; except the Gate of Nikanor, and the gate within that gate, and the entrance to the Chamber of Parhedrin, because this chamber was the High Priest&#39;s residence during his seven days of seclusion (prior to the Day of Atonement).&quot;,
            u&#39;7. A hayloft, a cattle-shed, a wood store and a barn are exempted from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because of the phrase, &quot;thy house&quot; (in the text &quot;thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house&quot;), which means a dwelling assigned to thy use and excludes the aforementioned and similar classes of buildings. Hence, a cattle-shed, where women stay adorning themselves, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because it also serves as a human habitation. A lodge or porch\u2014either rectangular or circular\u2014leading to a garden, a garden and a sheepfold are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because they are not constructed to serve as residences. If dwellings requiring a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; open to these places, the latter must also have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&#39;,
            u&#39;8. Hence, entrances, whether leading to courtyards or to passages, and gates of districts or cities, must each have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because dwellings which require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; open on to them. Even where ten rooms open one to the other, each requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; just as the innermost room requires it. This is the reason for the rule that a gate opening from the garden to a courtyard requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&#39;,
            u&quot;9. A privy, bath-house, ritual bath-house, tannery and similar places are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; because they are not erected to serve as dwellings for honored use. The tabernacle for the feast of Tabernacles, and a room in a ship are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; because they are not made for permanent occupancy. Of two potter&#39;s booths, one leading to the other, the exterior is exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because it is not permanent. Shops in market places are exempt, because they are not intended to be used as residences.&quot;,
            u&#39;10. A dwelling with several doors, although only one is regularly used for coming in and going out, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; affixed to each door. A small door between a dwelling (below) and the attic needs a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Every room in a dwelling, even a room within a room, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; at the entrance of the inner chamber, of the outer chamber and of the house, for they all serve the purpose of residence and are permanent.&#39;,
            u&#39;11. A door between a house of study or synagogue and a private house, if used habitually for entering and leaving, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If a door is between two dwellings, the position of the hinge determines the side on which the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is to be fixed. The side on which the hinge is visible is regarded as the dwelling in reference to which the position of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is decided.&#39;,
            u&#39;12. Where is the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; to be fixed? Within the width of the doorpost, a hand-breadth from the external edge at a height of a third of the elevation of the entrance, counting from the top. If placed higher it is fit in position, provided that it is a hand-breadth lower than the lintel. It should be fixed on the right side of one entering; if placed on the left side, it is unfit for use. A house owned by partners requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&#39;,
            u&#39;13. A person should pay heed to the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah;&lt;/i&gt; for it is an obligation perpetually binding upon all. Whenever one enters or leaves a home with the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on the doorpost, he will be confronted with the Declaration of God\&#39;s Unity, blessed be His holy name; and will remember the love due to God, and will be aroused from his slumbers and his foolish absorption in temporal vanities. He will realize that nothing endures to all eternity save knowledge of the Ruler of the Universe. This thought will immediately restore him to his right senses and he will walk in the paths of righteousness. Our ancient teachers said: He who has phylacteries on his head and arm, fringes on his garment and a Mezuzah on his door may be presumed not to sin, for he has many monitors\u2014angels that save him from sinning, as it is said, (Psalms 34:8) &quot;The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them&quot;.&#39;],
           [u&#39;1. It is an affirmative precept binding upon every individual Israelite to write a scroll of the Law for his own use, as it is said, &quot;Now therefore write ye this Song for you&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:19). As the Torah is not written in separate sections, this text means, &quot;Write for yourselves the Torah in which this Song is contained.&quot; Even if one\&#39;s ancestors have left a person a scroll, it is a religious duty to write a scroll at his own expense. If he wrote it with his own hand, it is accounted to him as if he had received it from Sinai. If one does not know how to write a scroll, he should get others to write it for him. He who corrects a scroll, even a single letter of it, is regarded as if he had written it completely.&#39;,
            u&#39;2. A king has the duty of writing for himself another scroll of the Law, in his capacity as sovereign, in addition to the scroll which he owns in his private capacity, as it is said, &quot;And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law, etc.&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:18). This copy is corrected by comparison with a scroll kept in the temple court, and under the authority of the Supreme Judicature. The scroll which the king had possessed when he was a private individual, he places in his archives. The one that he wrote or had written for him when he became king, should always be with him. If he goes to war, the scroll is to be with him. When he enters his home, it is to be with him. When he hears a cause (tries a case) it is to be with him. When he sits down to a meal, it is to be placed before him, as it is said, &quot;And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:19).&#39;,
            u&#39;3. If he possessed no scroll before he came to the throne, he has to write, after his accession, two scrolls of the law, one of which he places in his archives, while the other is to be always with him. It must never be away from him, except at night, or when he goes to the bath or the lavatory or lies down on his couch to sleep.&#39;,
            u&#39;4. A scroll of the Law that has been written without having been ruled, or that has been written partly on parchment made of whole hide and partly on that made of the inner half of split hide is unfit for use. It must be entirely written either on the former or on the latter. How is a scroll of the law to be written? The scribe is to use the correct script and it should also be exceedingly fine. Between one word and another, he is to leave the space of a small letter; between one letter and another (in the same word) the space of a hair\&#39;s breadth; between one line and the next the space of a line. The length of each line is to be thirty letters, wide enough to write the word Le-Mi-Sh-Pe-Ch-O-S-E-Che-M&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*Ten consonant letters printed here in capital letters. See also below.&lt;/i&gt; three times. This is to be the width of each column. No line shall be shorter, so that the column shall not look like an epistle. Nor should any line be wider so that the reader\&#39;s eyes should not have to wander across the sheet.&#39;,
            u&#39;5. He should not diminish the size of the characters in order to leave a space between one paragraph and another. When he comes (at the end of a line) to a word of five letters, he must not write two within the column and three outside the column; but he is to write three letters within the column and two outside the column. If there is not enough space left at the end of the line to write three letters, he is to leave it blank and begin at the commencement of the next line.&#39;,
            u&#39;6. If at the end of a line, he has a word of two letters to write, he may not place it between the columns (that is, outside the column) but he writes it at the beginning of the next line. If, before the line is filled up, he has a word of ten letters, more or less, to write and there is not enough space left on the line to write it all within the column, if he is able to write half the word within the column and half outside the column, he may do so. If he cannot do this, he leaves the space blank and writes the word at the beginning of the next line.&#39;,
            u&#39;7. Between each book and the next, he leaves a space of four lines, no more and no less, blank without any writing, and starts the next book at the beginning of the fifth line. When completing the Torah, he is to finish it in the middle of the line at the end of the column. If several lines of the column would be left, he shortens the lines, so as to begin at the beginning of the last line of the column and not complete it, and also so plans the lines that the final words &lt;i&gt;Le-\xe9n\xe9 Chol Yisrael&lt;/i&gt; (&quot;in the sight of all Israel&quot;) shall be in the middle of the line at the end of the column.&#39;,
            u&#39;8. He should pay careful attention to the letters that are written large or small, to the letters that are punctuated with dots above them, to the letters that are written differently to the others, such as the letter P\xe9 and the letters that are curved, in the way the scribes have carried on the tradition. He is to pay attention to the tittles&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*lines over each of the letters &lt;i&gt;Shin, Ayin, Teth, Nuen, Zayin, Gimel, Tzadi&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; and the number of them in each case\u2014one letter having above it a single tittle, another having seven tittles. All the tittles have the shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; and are to be thin as a hair.&#39;,
            u&#39;9. All these provisoes are only stated in order that the duty of writing a scroll shall be observed in the most perfect way. If, however the scribe made changes in the method here set forth, was not careful in regard to the tittles, writing however all the letters correctly, or if he wrote the lines close together or far apart, extended the lines or shortened them\u2014since he did not join any letter to another, omit aught or add aught, mar the form of any letter, nor make any variation in regard to which paragraphs should be open and which closed, the scroll is fit for use.&#39;,
            u&#39;10. There are other rules mentioned in the Talmud which the scribes observe as a tradition handed down from one to another. They are as follows: The number of lines in each column shall not be less than forty-eight and not more than sixty; the blank spaces between one section and another shall be such that nine letters, e.g., A She R, A She R, A She R, can be written in it. The five lines preceding the Song at the Red Sea (Exodus 14:28, 29, 30, 30, 31) shall begin respectively with the words &lt;i&gt;Habaim, Bayabashah, Hashem, Mes, Bemitzraim.&lt;/i&gt; The five lines after it shall begin respectively with the words &lt;i&gt;Vatikach, Achareha, Sus, Vayetz\xeb\xfc, Vayav\xf6\xfc&lt;/i&gt; (Exodus 15:20, 20, 21, 22, 23). The six lines before the Song of Moses beginning &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) shall respectively commence with the words &lt;i&gt;Veaeedah, Achar\xe9, Haderech, Beacharith, Lehacheeso, Kehal&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 31:28, 29, 29, 29, 29, 30); and the five lines after the Song of Moses shall begin with the words &lt;i&gt;Vayabo, Ledabber, Asher, Hazoth, Asher&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:44, 45, 46, 46, 47). All these points of observance are to enable us to fulfill the duty in the best way. Variations in these particulars do not render the scroll unfit for use.&#39;,
            u&#39;11. But if the scribe wrote &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; a word that should be &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or vice versa; or a word traditionally pronounced differently to the way it is written, according to the traditional pronunciation, for example, if he wrote &lt;i&gt;Yishkevenoh&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Yishgelenoh,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Oovatechorim&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Oova-apolim,&lt;/i&gt; etc.; or if he wrote an &quot;open&quot; section as if it were a closed section or vice versa; or if he wrote one of the Songs like the ordinary prose text, or an ordinary section in the form of one of the Songs, the scroll is unfit for use as a scroll of the Law. It has not the sacredness of a scroll of the Law, but is like any one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught.&#39;,
            u&#39;12. A scroll of the Law, which has not been examined for correctness may not be kept longer than thirty days. It must either be corrected or segregated.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*put away and not be used.&lt;/i&gt; A scroll of the Law which has three errors in each column should be corrected. If there are four, it must be put away. If the greater portion has been found to be correct, and the remainder has four errors in each column, but there is even one column in this erroneous portion with less than four errors, corrections could be made.&#39;,
            u&#39;13. This rule only applies to cases where the scribe wrote &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; words that should be written &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; so that he would be under the necessity of inserting the letters that he forgot between the lines. But if he wrote &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; words that are &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; even if every column contains several errors, he corrects them, as he only erases and does not have to insert letters between the lines.&#39;,
            u&quot;14. It is permitted to write the Pentateuch, each book in a separate scroll. These scrolls have not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law that is complete. One may not however write a scroll containing some sections. Such a scroll may not be written for a child&#39;s instruction. This is permitted, however, where there is the intention to complete the remainder of the book. If one wrote such a scroll with three words on each line, this is permitted.&quot;,
            u&#39;15. The Pentateuch, the Prophets and the Hagiography may be put together in one volume. In such a case, a space of four lines is left blank between each book of the Pentateuch and the next; a space of three lines between each of the major Prophets and the next; and a space of three lines between each of the twelve minor prophets and the next, so that he can, if he wishes, separate any book. The order of the prophetical books is as follows: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah, the Twelve Minor Prophets. The order of the books of the Hagiography is: Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel, Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.&#39;,
            u&#39;16. None of The Holy Scriptures may be written except on ruled lines, even if they are written on paper: Three words of Scripture may be written without ruling the line, but to write more is forbidden. A volume containing the Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiography has not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, but of a single book of the Pentateuch. The scroll which contains more than the entire Pentateuch is in the same class as that which contains less than the entire Pentateuch, on the principle that excess is similar to deficiency.&#39;],
           [u&#39;1. The &lt;i&gt;open&lt;/i&gt; section has two forms. If the previous section ended in the middle of a line, the scribe leaves the remainder of the line blank and commences the open section at the beginning of the next line. This only applies to the case where, after the conclusion of the previous section, there is left sufficient space on the line to write nine letters. But if the space left is less, or if the previous section was completed at the end of the line, the next line must be left blank, and the open section is begun at the commencement of the third line.&#39;,
            u&#39;2. A &lt;i&gt;closed&lt;/i&gt; section has three forms. If the previous section ended within the line, the scribe leaves a blank space for the required dimension (enough to write nine letters) and begins the closed section at the end of the line, provided that there is a blank space between it and the preceding section. If the completion of the previous section did not leave space for the blank of the required breadth and for writing (at least) one word at the end of the line, the scribe should leave the remainder of the line blank, leave a little space at the beginning of the next line blank, and begin the closed section within the line. If the previous section ended at the close of the line, he leaves a blank space of the required breadth (nine letters), at the beginning of the next line, and begins to write the closed section within the line. Hence, you may say that an open section always begins within the line.&#39;,
            u&#39;3. A scroll which is inaccurate in regard to words that are written &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; can be made good by being corrected, as already explained. But if the scribe made a mistake in the spacing between the sections, and wrote an open section as if it were a closed section, or a closed section as if it were an open section or left a space where a section does not end, or continued writing without leaving a space where a section ends, or deviated from the form in which the Songs are written, in all these cases, the Scroll is unfit for use and there is no remedy except to remove the entire column in which the mistake occurs.&#39;,
            u&#39;4. As in all the scrolls I have seen, I noticed serious incorrectness in these regards, while authorities on the Massorah, who write treatises and compilations with the aim of pointing out the sections that are closed and those that are open, differ according to the variations in the scrolls on which they rely, I deemed it fit to write here a list of the sections which are closed and those which are open, as also the forms in which the Songs of the Pentateuch are written so that all the scrolls may be corrected from, and compared with them. The copy on which I relied is the well-known Egyptian codex which contains the twenty-four books of the Scriptures and which had been in Jerusalem for several years\u2014used as the standard text for the examination of scrolls. Everyone relied upon it because it had been examined by Ben Asher who closely studied it for many years and examined it again whenever it was being copied. This codex was the text on which I relied in the scroll of the Law that I wrote according to the rules.&#39;,
            u&#39;(Here follow lists of open and closed sections which are in the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 131b to 136b.)&#39;,
            u&#39;THE BOOK OF GENESIS&#39;,
            u&#39;The number of open sections is 43; of closed sections 48; total 91.&#39;,
            u&#39;THE BOOK OF EXODUS&#39;,
            u&#39;The number of open sections is 69; of closed sections, 95; total 164.&#39;,
            u&#39;THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS&#39;,
            u&#39;The number of open sections is 52; of closed sections, 46; total 98.&#39;,
            u&#39;THE BOOK OF NUMBERS&#39;,
            u&#39;The number of open sections is 92; of closed sections, 66; total 158.&#39;,
            u&#39;THE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY&#39;,
            u&#39;The number of open sections of this book is 34; of closed sections, 124, total 158. The number of open sections in the entire Pentateuch is 290; of the closed sections, 379; total 669.&#39;,
            u&#39;The form of the Song &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43). Every line has a blank space in the middle, like that preceding a closed section. Hence, every line is divided into two parts. The song is written in 70 lines. The words at the beginning of the lines are as follows:&#39;,
            u&#39;(See the Hebrew text on the right hand side page 136a)&#39;,
            u&#39;All these are the words at the beginning of the lines. And the following are the words at the beginning of the latter half of the line which are in the middle of the column.&#39;,
            u&#39;(See the Hebrew text on the right hand pages 136a and 136b)&#39;,
            u&#39;The Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15:1-19) is written in thirty lines, the first line in the ordinary way; the other lines, one with a blank space in the middle, the next with blank spaces in two places, so that the line is divided into three parts and so a blank space corresponds to writing (above and below it) and vice versa as follows.&#39;,
            u&#39;See the Hebrew text on the right-hand side 136a, 136b and 137a as it should be written in the scroll. The English pages should be blank.&#39;,
            u&#39;Throughout the Torah, in the Songs as well as in the rest of the text, the scribe should aim to write all the letters of each word close together, taking care that no letter should be joined to another, and that no letter should be so far away from the next as to make the word seem two words. The interval between the letters in one word should be a hairbreadth. If the scribe wrote one letter so far apart from the other that it would appear to a child who is not familiar with the text like two words, the scroll is unfit for use till he makes the correction.&#39;],
           [u&#39;1. The length of a scroll of the Law should not exceed the circumference, nor should the circumference exceed the length. What is a suitable length? Where parchment of a whole hide is used, six hand-breadths, that is twenty-four finger-breadths taking the thumb as the standard. Where the parchment of the external half of the hide is used, the length may be more or less than this dimension, provided only that the length is equal to the circumference. So also in the case of parchment of a whole hide, if the scribe made the length less than six hand-breadths and wrote in a small hand or longer than six handbreadths and spread out the writing so that the length of the column is equal to the circumference\u2014this too is correct.&#39;,
            u&#39;2. The extent of the lower margin is four finger-breadths; of the upper margin, three finger-breadths; between one column and another, two finger-breadths. Hence, on the right and left of every sheet of parchment, the scribe has to leave a margin a finger-breadth wide and enough beside for sewing; so that, when the sheets are sewn together, there will be throughout the scroll a blank space of two finger-breadths between the columns. The scribe must leave in addition enough margin at the beginning and end of the scroll to fold a blank column round the rollers. All these dimensions are to be observed in order to fulfill the precept properly. But if the scribe exceeded or fell short of them, he does not render the scroll unfit for use.&#39;,
            u&#39;3. How shall one proceed so that the length of the scroll shall turn out equal to its circumference. The parchment sheets are made evenly rectangular; each sheet being six handbreadths wide, all of the same dimensions. They are rolled evenly into one bundle tightly rolled up. And skins are added and tightly rolled till the circumference is six handbreadths, which is the width of the sheets. This is measured with a thread of wool which is placed round the bundle.&#39;,
            u&#39;4. The scribe then fashions a straight ruler, forty or fifty finger-breadths long; one of these finger-breadths, he marks in two, three and four equal parts so as to be able to measure off a half, a third and a quarter of a finger-breadth and similar fractions. With this, he measures each sheet, so as to ascertain the number of finger-breadths it contains and so determine how many finger-breadths there are in the entire bundle.&#39;,
            u&#39;5. He then takes two or three other sheets of parchment, to test the size of the characters, and writes on them one column. The length of a column of writing is obviously seventeen finger-breadths as a margin must be left, of three finger-breadths above and four finger-breadths below. The width of the column will depend on the handwriting, whether it is large or small. So also, the number of lines will vary according to the handwriting, as between each line and the next, the space of a line must be left.&#39;,
            u&#39;6. Having written the column which he uses as a test as he pleases, he measures its breadth by means of the finger-breadths of the ruler, and adds two finger-breadths for the margin between column and column. He then calculates how many columns of such writing would fill the sheets in the bundle he had made up. Having ascertained the total number of columns, he will then see how much of the entire Pentateuch is in the column which he wrote as a test. He will make the estimate with the aid of the scroll which serves him as a copy, and calculate accordingly. If the number of columns of the kind of writing which he wrote is sufficient for the whole Torah\u2014well and good. If the calculation showed that there are more columns than are required for the whole Torah, he will enlarge the writing, so as to diminish the number of columns, and he will make a test with another column. If the calculation shows that for the writing of the Torah more columns will be required than are contained in his sheets, he will use smaller characters and so secure a larger number of columns. He will make the test with column after column till the calculation comes out exact.&#39;,
            u&#39;7. Once he knows the width of the column and the size of the characters, he can begin writing the scroll with that bundle of sheets. He then divides the parchment (sheets) into columns by ruling them off,\u2014each column of the same width as that which his tests and calculations showed to be the right size. If three or four finger-breadths are left over beyond the last column, he should leave one finger-breadth and enough besides for sewing the sheet to the next, and cut off the rest, and need feel no apprehension, for at the end, more sheets will be added to make up for the superfluous strips that he cut off from each sheet. Nor need he make any calculations in regard to this, for the writing will be according to the number of columns.&#39;,
            u&#39;8. So too, if one wishes to make the width of the scroll more or less than six handbreadths, he makes his calculation in the same way; and the length will be exactly equal to the circumference neither more nor less, provided that no mistake has been made in the calculation.&#39;,
            u&#39;9. The finger-breadth in all the dimensions here and in the rest of the Torah is that of the medium sized finger. On careful examination, we find it to be the breadth of seven medium sized barley corns placed close together, this being equal to the length of two barley corns measured liberally. The handbreadth, wherever mentioned, is equal to four such finger-breadths. A cubit is six handbreadths.&#39;,
            u&#39;10. The scroll which I wrote had a width of four finger-breadths to each column. The columns containing the Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15.1-18) &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) were each six finger-breadths wide. The number of lines in each column were fifty-one. The number of columns in the whole scroll were 226 columns. The length of the entire scroll was 13366 finger-breadths approximately.&#39;,
            u&#39;11. The six finger-breadths left over were for the margin at the beginning and end of the scroll. The parchment skins on which we wrote were ramskins. Whenever you desire to write a scroll and follow these measurements completely or approximately, you need not weary yourself to make a calculation if you have one, two or three columns less or more; you will find that the length will be equal to the circumference.&#39;,
            u&#39;12. No sheet should have less than three, nor more than eight columns. If a sheet is wide enough to contain nine columns, it is cut into two parts, one to contain four columns, the other to contain five columns. This rule applies to the beginning and middle of the scroll. But at the close, even if there is only left one verse to write on a column, that column is prepared on a separate sheet and sewn on to the other sheets.&#39;,
            u&#39;13. For sewing the sheets together, only the sinews of a clean beast domestic or wild, including those that are &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt; (literally torn), flesh of a beast that had suffered from a mortal lesion.&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\u2014flesh of a beast that had died or had not been slaughtered, or had been slaughtered by an unqualified or disqualified person.&lt;/i&gt; may be used. The law here is the same as in regard to phylacteries. This rule goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. Hence if the sheets have been sewn together but not with sinews or with sinews of an unclean animal, the scroll is unfit for use till the stitches are taken out and the sewing is done according to rule.&#39;,
            u&#39;14. When the sheets are sewn together, they are sewn entirely from top to bottom, but a small portion is left above and below without being stitched, so that the scroll, when it is rolled up, may not be torn in the middle. Two wooden rollers are prepared, one for either end. The unwritten margins of parchment at the beginning and at the end are brought round the rollers and sewn with sinews, so that the scroll can be rolled over them; a clear space being left between the margin and the writing in the columns.&#39;,
            u&#39;15. In case a scroll of the law had one of its sheets torn, the rent is sewn up, if it extends to two lines; if it extends to three lines, it is not sewn up. This rule applies to a scroll the gall dressing of which is no longer perceptible. But if the parchment still shows that it has been dressed, then, even when the rent extends to three lines, it is sewn up. So too, a rent between columns or between words is sewn up. For the stitching of the rents, the same kind of sinews are used as for the sheets. And wherever there is a rent, the scribe should make sure that no letter is missing or altered in form.&#39;],
           [u&#39;1. You thus find that there are twenty factors, any one of which disqualifies a scroll of the law. If any of these occurs, the scroll is like one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught. It does not possess the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, and is not used for reading in public worship. They are as follows:&#39;,
            u&#39;1) If it was written on the skin of a beast of an unclean species;&#39;,
            u&#39;2) or on the skin of a beast of a clean species, which had not been tanned;&#39;,
            u&#39;3) If the skin had been tanned but not for the express purpose of being used as a scroll of the law;&#39;,
            u&#39;4) If it was written on the wrong side; in the case of parchment of whole hide on the side next to the flesh; in the case of parchment of the outer half of a split hide, on the side adjacent to the hair;&#39;,
            u&#39;5) If it was written partly on parchment of whole hide and partly on that made of the outer half of split hide;&#39;,
            u&#39;6) If it was written on the inner half of a split hide;&#39;,
            u&#39;7) If it was written without the lines having been previously ruled;&#39;,
            u&#39;8) If it was written with a dark writing fluid that does not make a permanent impression;&#39;,
            u&#39;9) If it was written in other languages;&#39;,
            u&#39;10) If it was written by a heretic (Epikouros) or other disqualified persons;&#39;,
            u&#39;11) If the scribe wrote the names of God without special concentration of mind;&#39;,
            u&#39;12) If a single letter was omitted;&#39;,
            u&#39;13) If a single letter was added;&#39;,
            u&#39;14) If one letter touched another;&#39;,
            u&#39;15)\tIf a single letter was so marred that it cannot be read at all, or resembles another letter, whether the defect is in the writing, or is due to a perforation, rent or smudge;&#39;,
            u&#39;16)\tIf the scribe wrote letters so far apart or so closely together that one word looks like two words or two words look like one word;&#39;,
            u&#39;17)\tIf he altered the form of the sections&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*Wrote an \u201copen\u201d section as if it were a \u201cclosed\u201d section or vice versa.&lt;/i&gt;;&#39;,
            u&#39;18)\tIf he varied the form of writing the Songs;&#39;,
            u&#39;19)\tIf he wrote any other portion in the form of a Song;&#39;,
            u&#39;20)\tIf he did not sew the sheets with sinews of a beast of a clean species.&#39;,
            u&#39;The other conditions stated are recommended as the best way of performing the duty of writing a scroll. Their non-observance does not render it unfit for use.&#39;,
            u&#39;2. A scroll of the law that is fit for use is to be regarded as an object of extreme holiness and treated with great reverence. A person is forbidden to sell a scroll of the law even if he has nothing to eat, and even if he owns other scrolls. He may not even sell an old scroll, to buy a new one. A scroll may only be sold for one of two purposes, to provide means to enable one to study Torah or to marry\u2014and then only if the owner has nothing else that he can sell.&#39;,
            u&#39;3. If a scroll of the law has become worn out or been otherwise rendered unfit for use; it is placed in an earthenware vessel and buried beside the remains of deceased scholars. This is the appropriate method of &quot;concealing&quot; it (putting it away). Folders of scrolls that have become worn out are used as shrouds for the dead (found on the road) whose interment is a duty binding on all. This is the appropriate method of &quot;concealing&quot; them.&#39;,
            u&#39;4. A case specially made for a scroll of the law and in which it has been placed, bands around the scrolls, the chest or structure in which it is deposited even though the scroll is in its case, as also a bench specially made on which to place a scroll of the law, and on which a scroll was placed are all subsidiaries of that which is sacred, and may not be thrown away. When worn out or broken, they are &quot;put away&quot;. The platforms, however, on which the Reader of the congregation stands and holds the scroll and tablets on which (scriptures) are written for a child\&#39;s instruction have no sanctity. Golden and silver pomegranates and other such ornaments, made for the embellishment of a scroll of the law are subsidiaries of that which is sacred; and it is forbidden to part with them to be used for secular purposes, unless they were sold with the intention to purchase with their proceeds a scroll of the law or a book of the Pentateuch.&#39;,
            u&#39;5. It is permitted to place one scroll of the law upon another scroll, or, needless to add, upon single books of the Pentateuch. Single books of the Pentateuch may be placed upon books of the Prophets or Hagiography. But the books of the prophets and of the Hagiography are not placed upon single books of the Pentateuch; nor the latter on a scroll of the law. No sacred writings, not even Halachas or Hagadas (Legalistic or Homiletic works) may be thrown away. Amulets which contain scriptural matter, must not be taken with one into a lavatory (privy) unless they are covered with a skin.&#39;,
            u&#39;6. A person may not, while bearing a scroll of the law in his arms, enter a bath-house, lavatory, or cemetery, even if the scroll is swathed in folders and placed in its case. A person must not read in it till he has moved away four cubits from the dead body (bath house) or lavatory. One may not hold a scroll of the law when nude. It is forbidden to sit down on a couch on which there is a scroll of the law.&#39;,
            u&#39;7. Cohabitation is forbidden in a chamber where there is a scroll of the law, till it has been removed or placed in a receptacle which is itself placed in a receptacle not specially assigned to the scroll. If it has however been so assigned, even ten receptacles within each other, are regarded as a single receptacle. If a partition, ten handbreadths high, has been constructed for the scroll, cohabitation may take place if there is no other room. It may not take place, if there is another room, till the scroll has been removed.&#39;,
            u&quot;8. All who are ritually unclean, even women in their menstruating period, and even a non-Israelite, may hold a scroll of the law and read in it, for the words of the Torah do not contract uncleanliness, provided that the holder&#39;s hands are not dirty or soiled. They must therefore wash their hands and then they may touch it.&quot;,
            u&#39;9. Every one who sees a person carrying a scroll of the law and proceeding with it must stand up before it; and all persons continue standing till the bearer of the scroll stops, having carried it to its appointed place, or passes out of sight. They are then permitted to resume their seats.&#39;,
            u&quot;10. It is a duty to assign a fixed place for a scroll of the law, and to show it extreme honor and courtesy. The words in the tables of the covenant are in every scroll of the law. One may not expectorate before a scroll of the law, nor indecently expose oneself before it, nor stretch out one&#39;s feet before it; nor place it upon the head in the way in which a burden is carried; nor turn one&#39;s back to it unless it is at an elevation of ten handbreadths above the person.&quot;,
            u&#39;11. If one is travelling from place to place and had a scroll of the law with him, he is not to put the scroll in a sack, place it on the donkey\&#39;s back and ride upon it. If, however, he is afraid of thieves, he may do so. When there is no such apprehension, he places it in his bosom close to his heart, and continues his journey, riding. Any one, sitting before a scroll of the law, should be inspired with a sense of earnestness, awe and reverence, for it is a faithful witness concerning all who come into the world, as it is said, &quot;It shall be therefore a witness against thee&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:26). All possible honor should be shown it. The ancient sages said, &quot;Whoever treats the Torah with contumely will be treated with contumely by his fellow-creatures. Whoever honors the Torah, will receive honor from his fellow creatures&quot; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:8). End of the laws concerning the scroll of the Law by the Grace of God.&#39;]],

            <td class="code"><pre>u&#39;{&quot;text&quot;: [[&quot;1. The four Pentateuchal sections, beginning respectively, \\&quot;Sanctify unto me\\&quot; (Ex. 13:1-10), \\&quot;And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee\\&quot; (Exodus 13:11-16)\\u2014these two being in the Book of Exodus, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) \\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13-21), are written and covered with a skin. These are called &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; and are placed upon the head and bound on the arm. The omission of the point of a single letter in any one of these sections bars, according to Scriptural enactment, the use of all of them. They must all be written perfectly and in accordance with rule.&quot;, &quot;2. This is the case also with the two sections of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; beginning respectively, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) and \\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). If the point of a letter is missing in these two sections, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may not, according to Scriptural enactment, be used. The two sections must be written perfectly. So too, a scroll of the Law, in which a single letter is missing, is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;3. There are ten points in regard to &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; (phylacteries). The observance of each is enjoined by a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. The neglect of any of them is an absolute bar to the use of the &lt;i&gt;Tephillin.&lt;/i&gt; Hence, if there was a variation in any one of them, the &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; are unfit for use. Two of these have reference to the writing; eight, to the covering and the tying of the straps. The two points to be observed in the writing are that the sections must be written with ink, and must be written on parchment.&quot;, &quot;4. How is the ink prepared? Soot of oils or of pitch, wax or similar substance is collected; kneaded with gum of trees and a little honey; thoroughly wetted and pounded till it is like wafers. It is then stored away. When the scribe wishes to write, he soaks it in water in which gall-apples or similar substances have been steeped, and with this fluid he writes. Such writing when erased leaves no mark. This is the best way to write scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs.&lt;/i&gt; If the scribe has written with fluid of the gall-oak or of caper,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Caper: flower-buds or seeds of a low shrub of Mediterranean countries, used as a condiment.&lt;/i&gt; since the writing stays and is not rubbed out, scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; so written are fit for use.&quot;, &quot;5. This being so, what is excluded by the Halacha, dating back to Moses, which ordains that these must be written with ink? It excludes pigments of other colors, such as red or green, etc.; so that if even a single letter in a scroll of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; was written with pigment of any other color [but black] or with gold, such a Scroll, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;6. There are three kinds of parchment, &lt;i&gt;Gewil, Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Duxustus.&lt;/i&gt; How are these made? A hide of domestic cattle or wild beast is taken. First, its hair is removed. It is then pickled in salt, afterwards prepared with flour and subsequently tanned with gall-wood or similar materials which contract the pores of the hide and make it durable. And this it is that is called &lt;i&gt;Gewil&lt;/i&gt; (parchment of whole-hide leather).&quot;, &quot;7. If, after removing the hair, the hide had been split through its thickness into two parts, so as to make of it two skins, one thin, namely that which had been next to the hair; the other thick, namely that which had been next to the flesh, and if these were prepared first with salt, then with flour and afterwards with gall-wood or similar substance the skin which had been next to the hair is called &lt;i&gt;Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; (= outer-skin parchment), and that which had been next to the flesh is called &lt;i&gt;Duxustus&lt;/i&gt; (inner-skin parchment).&quot;, &quot;8. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that the scroll of the Law should be written on &lt;i&gt;Gewil&lt;/i&gt; (whole hide parchment), and the writing should be on the side which had been next to the hair. The &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; should be written on &lt;i&gt;Kelaf&lt;/i&gt; (the exterior part of the split hide) and the writing should be on the side which had been nearer the flesh; and the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; should be written on &lt;i&gt;Duxustus&lt;/i&gt; (made of the inner part of the split hide), on the side which had been nearer the hair. If, on a &lt;i&gt;Kelaf,&lt;/i&gt; one writes on the side that had been next to the hair, or, on a &lt;i&gt;Gewil or Duxustus,&lt;/i&gt; one writes on the side that had been next to the flesh, the Scroll, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; so written is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;9. Though this is the rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai, yet if one writes a scroll of the Law on parchment made from the exterior half of a split hide it is fit for use. The reason why a complete hide is mentioned is in order to exclude that made from the inner half of the split hide. If one wrote on it a scroll of the Law, it is unfit for use. So also, if one wrote a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on the external half of a split hide or on an undivided hide, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use. The inner half of a split hide is recommended to be used, only as a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (specially approved).&quot;, &quot;10. Scrolls, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; are not written on the hide of a domestic or wild beast that is unclean or on the skin of an unclean bird. They are written on the hides of domestic or wild beasts that are clean or on the skins of clean birds, even when the flesh of these animals may not be eaten owing to their not having been slaughtered according to the ritual or being found to have suffered from a lesion of a mortal character. Nor are Scrolls, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzahs&lt;/i&gt; written on the skin of a fish, even if it be of a clean species, because of its foulness. For this is not removed by tanning.&quot;, &quot;11. The undivided skin for a scroll of the Law, and the external half of the hide to be used for &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; or for a scroll of the Law must be tanned for their specific purposes. If they were not expressly so tanned, they are not fit for use. Accordingly, if a non-Israelite or a Samaritan tanned them, they are unfit for use. Even if the Samaritan was instructed to tan a particular hide for the purpose of its being used for a scroll of the Law or &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; it is unfit for use; since he works with his own purposes in mind, not with those of his employer. Hence, anything that has to be done with a purpose in mind, if done by a Samaritan, is unfit for use. The skin for a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; does not require to be tanned for that express purpose.&quot;, &quot;12. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that a scroll of the Law or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may only be written on parchment that is ruled. Phylacteries need not be ruled, because they are covered. So too, phylacteries and a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; may be written from memory, as these sections are recited by and are familiar to everyone. But not a single letter may be written in a scroll of the Law, except from a written copy of the text.&quot;, &quot;13. A scroll of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; written by a heretic must be burnt. If written by a Samaritan, by a Jew converted to another faith, by one who surrenders Israelites to tyrants, by a slave, woman or minor, they are unfit for use, and must be hidden; for it is said, \\&quot;And thou shalt bind them\\&quot;, \\&quot;And thou shalt write them\\&quot;. The implication is that only that person is qualified to write them, who is charged with the duty of putting on &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and believes in the obligation. If they are found in the possession of a heretic, and it is not known who wrote them, they should be hidden. If found in the possession of a Samaritan or non-Israelite, they are fit to be used. Scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; are not to be bought from non-Israelites for more than their value, so as not to accustom the latter to steal these holy articles or take them by force.&quot;, &quot;14. A scroll of the Law, phylacteries or &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth,&lt;/i&gt; written on the skin of a beast or bird\\u2014whether domestic or wild\\u2014which belongs to an unclean species, or written on skins that have not been tanned, and likewise a scroll of the Law or phylacteries written on skins not expressly tanned for those purposes, are unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;15. If one who writes a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; had not concentrated his mind while writing, and wrote one of the Names of God without express intent, these articles are unfit for use. Accordingly, when one is writing the name of God, even if an Israelite king greets him, he must not return the greeting. If he is writing two or three names of God, he may pause between writing one and writing the others and may respond.&quot;, &quot;16. After dipping the pen in ink to write the Name of God, the scribe does not start with a letter of the name but with a letter of the previous word. If he altogether forgot to write the name of God, he writes it above the line. But to write part of the name on the line and part above the line makes the scroll unfit for use. Other words that the scribe forgot to write may be written partly on the line and partly above it. These rules apply to a scroll of the Law. But in a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; or in phylacteries not a letter may be written above the line. If the scribe forgot even one letter, he must hide what he wrote and write a fresh slip. In all of them (Scrolls of the Law, &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; and Phylacteries) it is permissible to write the name of God upon a surface from which writing has been erased or obliterated.&quot;, &quot;17. Scribes of scrolls, phylacteries and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; are forbidden to turn over the parchment sheet with its written surface beneath touching the board on which it lies, but should cover it with a cloth or fold it.&quot;, &quot;18. If, after a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; had passed out of the scribe\&#39;s hands, he makes the statement, \\&quot;I did not write the name of God in them with that purpose distinctly in mind\\&quot;, he is not believed to the extent of rendering them unfit for use, but his statement is accepted so far that he forfeits his entire remuneration. The reason why he is not believed so as to render them unfit for use is because his motive may possibly have been to cause a loss to the person who bought or hired them. It would seem however that his statement would only cause him to forfeit that quota of remuneration to which the writing of the names of God would entitle him. Hence, if he stated, \\&quot;the skins of this scroll of the Law or of these phylacteries were not expressly tanned for those purposes\\&quot;, then since in such a case he is believed so fully that he forfeits the whole of his remuneration, his statement is also credited so as to disqualify the articles from being used\\u2014it being a matter of general knowledge that if the skins had not been expressly tanned for the purpose of being made into phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, the scribe receives no remuneration whatsoever.&quot;, &quot;19. Phylacteries and &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth&lt;/i&gt; may only be written in square Hebrew script. Permission was also given to write scrolls of the Law in Greek characters but not in those of any other foreign tongue. The ancient Greek script has gone out of use, been corrupted and become obsolete. Hence, at the present day, all three religious articles,\\u2014Scroll of the Law, Tephillin and Mezuzah,\\u2014are only written in the square Hebrew script. Care must be taken in writing that no letter shall adhere to any other letter; for any letter which is not completely surrounded on all four sides by a blank space of parchment has been improperly written. Any letter that cannot be read by a child of ordinary intelligence\\u2014not particularly bright or dull\\u2014is improperly written. Thus a &lt;i&gt;Yod&lt;/i&gt; must not be like a &lt;i&gt;Vav&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Vav&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Yod,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Koph&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Beth,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Beth&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Koph,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Daleth&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Resh,&lt;/i&gt; nor a &lt;i&gt;Resh&lt;/i&gt; like a &lt;i&gt;Daleth,&lt;/i&gt; etc., so that the reader may be able to read fluently.&quot;, &quot;20. If the parchment was perforated, the scribe must not write on the perforation. A perforation over which the ink passes is not regarded as a perforation, and it is permitted to write across it. Hence, it is permitted to write on the skin of a bird that has been tanned. Should the parchment have become perforated, after it has been written on, if the perforation is in the interior of a letter, as, for example, in a &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mem,&lt;/i&gt; etc., it is regarded as properly written. Should one of the sides of a letter have been perforated, so that the letter is divided\\u2014then the rule is that if there is left of the part that is unperforated as much as would form a small letter, it is regarded as properly written, provided that it does not resemble a different letter. If the part that is left unperforated is not as much as would form a small letter, it is not regarded as properly written.&quot;], [&quot;1. How are the sections in the phylactery that is placed on the head to be written? The four sections are respectively written on four separate slips of parchment; each slip is rolled up separately and they are then placed in four compartments composed of one skin. As to the phylactery placed on the arm, these four sections are written in four columns on one slip of parchment. This slip is rolled up like a scroll of the Law from the last column to the first and is placed in one [leather] compartment.&quot;, &quot;2. The scribe must exercise care in writing these sections, for if he wrote a closed section as an open one,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*that is, began the section on a new line where only a space of nine letters should have been left blank.&lt;/i&gt; or wrote an open section as if it were closed, the slip is unfit for use. The first three sections are, all of them, open. The last section, that beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass, if ye will hearken diligently\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is closed.&quot;, &quot;3. He must exercise care in regard to the words that are &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**with or without a &lt;i&gt;Yod&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Vav,&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&lt;/i&gt; that all the four sections should be written as they are in an examined scroll of the Law. For if he wrote a word &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; that should have been written &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; the slip is unfit for use till the superfluous letter has been obliterated. If a word that is &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; has been written &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; the slip is unfit for use and cannot be made good. The following is the list of the words in these four sections that are &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&quot;, &quot;[&lt;i&gt;For paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 (lists of&lt;/i&gt; plene &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; defective &lt;i&gt;words), see the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 121b and 122a&lt;/i&gt;.]&quot;, &quot;6. The &lt;i&gt;Ayin&lt;/i&gt; of Shema and &lt;i&gt;Daleth&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Echad&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 6:4) are to be written in larger type.&quot;, &quot;8. He must pay attention to the \\&quot;crowns\\&quot; (tittles) above the letters. These are like an upright &lt;i&gt;Zayin&lt;/i&gt; and are placed on each letter to which such a crown belongs as written in the scroll of the Law. The following are the letters in the four sections thus ornamented:&quot;, &quot;9. In the first section, there is only one such letter, namely the closed &lt;i&gt;Mem&lt;/i&gt; in Meeyamim which has over it three &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. In the second section, there are five letters, each of them a &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9;&lt;/i&gt; and on each, there are four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. These are the &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Unesanah; the first and the last &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Hikshah; the &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Vayaharog; the &lt;i&gt;H\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Yadchah.&quot;, &quot;10. The third section has five such letters. The &lt;i&gt;Koof&lt;/i&gt; in Uvekoomecha has over it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines; the &lt;i&gt;Koof&lt;/i&gt; in Ukeshartam has over it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines; the two letters &lt;i&gt;Teth,&lt;/i&gt; and the letter &lt;i&gt;P\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Letotaphoth have on each of them four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines.&quot;, &quot;11. The fourth section has five such letters. The &lt;i&gt;P\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; of Veasaphta has above it three &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. The &lt;i&gt;Tav&lt;/i&gt; of Veasaphta has one &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped line. The two letters &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; and the letter &lt;i&gt;P\\u00e9&lt;/i&gt; in Letotaphoth have on each of them four &lt;i&gt;zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. Altogether, the letters thus ornamented are sixteen. If the scribe wholly omitted these ornaments, added to them or omitted them over some of the letters, he has not rendered the phylacteries unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;12. If one buys phylacteries from one who is not a recognized expert, he has to examine them. If he bought from him one hundred parchment slips, he examines three slips, either two of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the arm or two slips of those in the phylacteries worn on the arm and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head. If he found all these three correct, a presumption is established in the vendor\&#39;s favour, and all his phylacteries are fit for use and the rest need not be examined. If he bought them however in several bundles, this examination (of three slips) must take place in each bundle, there being a presumption that the several bundles came from different individuals.&quot;, &quot;13. A man who wrote phylacteries with his own hand or purchased them from an expert or, having bought them of a non-expert, examined them and replaced them in their leather containers, need never re-examine them, even after the lapse of many years. As long as the leather container remains sound, the presumption that they are sound holds good. Nor is it apprehended that a letter has been obliterated or perforated. Hillel the Elder was wont to say, \\&quot;These phylacteries belonged to my mother\&#39;s father.\\&quot;&quot;], [&quot;1. There are eight rules for the making of phylacteries; all of them are traditionally ascribed to Moses who received them on Sinai; hence the observance of all of them is indispensable. A variation from any of them renders the phylacteries unfit for use. The rules are as follows: The phylacteries (that is, the external leather containers) must be square; they are to be sewn in such a way as to retain the square shape; their diagonals must be those of a square so that all the angles shall be equal; the leather container of the phylactery for the head shall have the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; embossed on the right and on the left side; each of the slips of parchment on which the sections from the Pentateuch are written is to be wrapt in a cover; this is to be tied with hair, and then the slips are placed in their respective compartments which are sewn up with sinews; a border with a fold open at both ends shall be made of the skin of the base for the strap to pass through freely; the straps shall be black, and have the special knot, that is known to all, in the shape of a &lt;i&gt;Daleth.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;2. How is the phylactery for the head made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length, breadth and height. It is of no consequence however if the height is more than the breadth or less. What is essential is that the length and breadth shall be equal. Three grooves are cut in the block so that it is divided into four parts as in this figure &lt;img src=\\&quot;data:image/jpg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEBLAEsAAD/2wBDAAUDBAQEAwUEBAQFBQUGBwwIBwcHBw8LCwkMEQ8SEhEP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\\nClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUClKUH//Z\\n\\&quot;&gt;. A piece of leather is taken and soaked in water. The wooden block is put in it and the leather is inserted into each groove.

The leather is left on the wood till it dries; it is then slipped off from the wooden block, with the result that it has the shape of four compartments. The prescribed sections of Scripture written on slips of parchment are placed, one in each compartment. A portion of the leather is drawn round and beneath the cube (to form its base). This is sewn up at its four sides. A portion is left in this skin at the base for the strap to pass through as in a loop. This it is which is called the bridge.&quot;, &quot;4. How are the phylacteries for the arm made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length and breadth. It is to be a finger-breadth in height, or a little more or less. The block is covered with wet leather which is left on till it dries. It is then removed, and in the place where the wood had been, a single slip of parchment on which the four prescribed sections of Scripture are written, is inserted. A portion of the leather is drawn round below and is sewn up at its four sides. Of this base a part is left to form a loop for the strap to pass through.&quot;, &quot;5. What is the order in which the sections are placed in the phylactery for the head? The last section, that beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass if ye will hearken diligently\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is placed in the first compartment, to the right of the wearer; the section beginning, \\&quot;Hear O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4) in the compartment adjacent to it; the section beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God will bring thee\\&quot; (Exodus 13:11), next to the one containing the section, \\&quot;Hear O Israel\\&quot;, and the section beginning, \\&quot;Sanctify unto me every first born\\&quot; (Exodus 13:1) in the fourth compartment which would be to the left of the wearer of the phylactery; so that anyone facing the wearer and reading what is before him would read the sections in the right Scriptural order as in the annexed figure. If there&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Sections beginning with verse:&lt;/i&gt; was a deviation from this order, the phylacteries are not fit for use.&quot;, &quot;6. The sections for the phylactery for the arm are written in four columns on one long strip of parchment like a scroll of the Law, and in the order in which they are found in the Pentateuch as in the annexed figure.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**Sections beginning with verse:&lt;/i&gt; If the scribe wrote them on four separate slips and placed them in one compartment, he has done what is required, and need not attach them to each other.&quot;, &quot;7. When he rolls up the parchment slips containing the sections, for the phylacteries worn on the head or on the arm, he rolls them from the end to the beginning so that, if opened, each section can be read from the beginning to the end.&quot;, &quot;8. When the slips are about to be placed in their respective compartments, they are wrapped in a cloth, over which they are fastened with hair. They are then deposited in their compartments. This hair must be that of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species; and may even be taken from animals which are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;***&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;***&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014died of itself or, by extension of meaning, not properly killed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;\\u2020&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;\\u2020&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014torn by wild beast; by extension of meaning, found to have suffered from mortal disease or lesion.&lt;/i&gt; The custom that has come into general use is to fasten the slips with hair taken from calves\&#39; tails.&quot;, &quot;9. The leather receptacles of the phylacteries are only sewn with sinews of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species, and may be taken from animals of such species even if they are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014died of itself or, by extension of meaning, not properly killed;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014torn by wild beast; by extension of meaning, found to have suffered from mortal disease or lesion.&lt;/i&gt; The sinews used are those found in the heel of the domestic or wild beast, which are white and tough. They are softened by pounding them with stones or similar substances, till they become like flax. They are spun and twined, and then used for sewing the phylacteries and the sheets of the scrolls of the Law.&quot;, &quot;10. The receptacles are to be sewn in such a way as to preserve the square contour of the base. It is a broadly established rule that on each side, there are to be three stitches, making altogether twelve stitches, whether the phylactery is for the arm or for the head. If the scribe desires to make ten or fourteen stitches, he may do so. The stitch must pass through the leather on both sides.&quot;, &quot;11. The grooves of the phylacteries for the head ought to extend to the base where the stitching is done. If the grooves are recognizable so that the four divisions clearly appear, the phylacteries are fit for use, even though the grooves do not extend to the base. If however the grooves are not recognizable, the phylacteries are unfit for use. Within each groove, above the leather, a thread or cord ought to be passed so as to separate the compartments from each other. The general custom is to draw through each of the three grooves a sinew of the same kind as those used for the stitches.&quot;, &quot;12. How are the thongs fixed? A strip of leather is taken as wide as the length of a barley corn. If wider, it is fit for use. The length of the strap of the phylactery for the head should be sufficient to encircle the head, form the knot and leave enough for the straps on either side to reach to the navel or a little higher. The strap for the phylactery of the arm should be sufficiently long to encircle the forearm, form the knot, extend down to the middle finger, about which it is to be wound three times and then fastened. If the straps exceed in length the foregoing dimensions, they are also fit for use.&quot;, &quot;13. The thong of the phylactery for the head is inserted in the loop open at both ends. It is measured to fit the wearer\&#39;s head, and then tied in a rectangular knot like a &lt;i&gt;Daleth.&lt;/i&gt; This knot, every scholar should learn how to make. It is impossible to teach its form by description; this can only be taught by ocular demonstration. In the case of the phylactery for the arm, the thong is tied in a knot in the shape of a &lt;i&gt;Yod.&lt;/i&gt; The thong of the phylactery for the arm should move freely in the loop, so that the wearer can loosen or tighten it when he puts it on his arm.&quot;, &quot;14. The thongs of the phylacteries, whether for the head or for the arm, must have their exterior surface black. This is a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. But the other side of the thongs, being close to the skin, are fit for use if they are green or white. They must not however be red, for if the thong were inadvertently turned, the color of its lower surface would subject the wearer to ignominy. The lower side of the thongs should not be otherwise in color than the base of the leather case containing the parchment slips. If the latter is green, the former should be green; if white, the former should be white. It is comely if the phylacteries are wholly black, namely, both the case containing the slips of parchment and the thongs.&quot;, &quot;15. The leather which forms the receptacles of the phylacteries and its thongs is to be made from the hide of a domestic or wild quadruped or skin of a fowl that belongs to the clean species, and may even be taken from those of these species that are &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Terefah.&lt;/i&gt; If they were made of the skin or hide of unclean species, or if the phylacteries were covered with gold, the phylacteries are unfit for use. The leather for the thongs must be expressly tanned for their intended purpose to be thongs of phylacteries. The leather which forms the receptacles for the phylacteries need not be tanned. Even if it consists of raw hide it is fit for use. Many places have the custom to make them of raw hide.&quot;, &quot;16. The receptacles of the phylacteries may not be prepared by any one but an Israelite; for the making of these is like the writing of the prescribed sections because of the letter &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; which is embossed on the phylactery for the head, as we have already stated. Hence, if a non-Israelite made or sewed the phylacteries, they are unfit for use. So too, whoever is disqualified from writing the prescribed sections for the phylacteries may not prepare them.&quot;, &quot;17. The phylactery for the head may not be transformed into a phylactery for the arm, but the latter may be changed into the former; on the principle that an object may not be degraded from a higher to a lower sacred use. So too, the thong of the phylactery for the head may not be transferred to a phylactery for the arm. This rule only applies to phylacteries that had been worn. But with regard to phylacteries for the head that no one had ever worn, if it is desired to transform them into phylacteries for the arm, this may be done. How is this effected? It is covered with leather so that it appears as one receptacle. The phylactery may then be bound on the arm.&quot;, &quot;18. In case the stitches of the phylacteries are broken, they become unfit for use if there are two broken stitches adjacent to each other, or three not adjacent. This rule applies to old phylacteries. New phylacteries are fit for use as long as they keep their surface unimpaired. The following would be called new. If, at the place where the stitches have given way, part of the leather is held in the hand so that the phylactery is suspended, and the leather is strong enough not to be further torn, such phylacteries would be regarded as new. If however the leather is not strong enough to bear the weight of the phylacteries so suspended, but would tear, such phylacteries are regarded as old.&quot;, &quot;19. A thong that has become broken is not to be tied together nor sewn up; but it is to be removed, put away, and replaced by a new thong. The parts of the broken thong are unfit for use unless the length and breadth of the part is of the prescribed dimension or larger. Care should always be taken that the external surface of the thongs should be above, when the phylacteries are bound on the hand or round the head. End of the chapter.&quot;], [&quot;1. Where is the phylactery of the head placed? It is placed on that part of the crown of the head, where the hair adjacent to the forehead ends, and this is the place where an infant\&#39;s brain pulsates (the fontanelle). The phylactery needs to be adjusted so that it lies in the centre of the forehead, in a line with the point between the eyes. The knot should be at the top of the back of the neck, which is the end of the skull.&quot;, &quot;2. The phylactery of the hand is bound on the left arm over the biceps muscle which is the flesh that stands out on the upper arm that is intermediate between the shoulder-blade and forearm, so that when the upper arm is held close to the ribs, the phylactery will be opposite the heart and thus the precept will be fulfilled, \\&quot;And these words \\u2026 shall be upon thine heart\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:6).&quot;, &quot;3. To lay the phylactery of the hand on the palm or that of the head on the forehead is the practice of the Sadducees. He who makes the phylactery round like a nut is not fulfilling the precept in any way. A left-handed person lays the phylactery on his right arm, used by him as his left. If one is ambidextrous, he lays it on his left arm, which is the same as the left arm of any other person. The places where the phylacteries are respectively bound and laid are known by tradition.&quot;, &quot;4. The lack of a phylactery for the head does not preclude one from putting on that of the hand, nor does the lack of a phylactery of the hand preclude one from putting on that for the head. Each is a duty separate and independent. What blessings are recited? For the phylactery of the head, the formula is as follows: \\&quot;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and given us a command concerning the precept of phylacteries\\&quot;. For that of the hand, the form is as follows: \\&quot;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to lay the phylacteries\\&quot;.&quot;, &quot;5. This rule applies to the case where a person puts on one phylactery only. But when one lays both phylacteries, he recites one blessing, namely, the form, \\&quot;And hast commanded us to lay the phylacteries\\&quot;, binds the phylactery on his arm, and then puts on that for the head. When they are removed, that on the head is removed first, and afterwards that on the arm.&quot;, &quot;6. When a person has recited the blessing, \\&quot;Who hast commanded us to lay phylacteries\\&quot;, and bound the phylactery on his arm, he is forbidden to converse, even to the extent of acknowledging his master\&#39;s greeting, till he has put on the phylactery of the head. If he conversed he has committed a transgression; and when putting on the phylactery for the head, he must recite another blessing, viz: the form, \\&quot;Who hast given us a command concerning the precept of the phylacteries\\&quot;, and then he puts on the phylactery for the head.&quot;, &quot;7. On each occasion when one puts on phylacteries, the blessing is recited, even if they are removed and put on again several times in the day. It is a universal rule with regard to religious precepts that the appropriate blessings are recited prior to their performance. Hence too, the blessing for the phylactery of the hand has to be recited after it is placed on the biceps muscle before the thong is tightened, for the fastening constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.&quot;, &quot;8. When a person removes his phylacteries, and puts them in a bag, he should not place the phylactery of the hand beneath and that for the head above it, because when he will again have occasion to put them on, he will come into contact with the phylactery of the head first, will thus be under the necessity of putting it down and take out the phylactery of the hand, the former not being put on before the latter. It is forbidden to leave a precept and pass on to the fulfillment of another religious duty, the rule being that the duty that first presents itself should first engage our attention. Hence, the phylactery for the hand should be placed above so that one may come into contact with it first, and the phylacteries be put on in the right order.&quot;, &quot;9. A bag expressly intended to contain phylacteries and into which these have been placed, becomes consecrated and may not be put to secular use. If the bag was intended for this express purpose of containing phylacteries but had never contained them, or if phylacteries had been casually placed in a bag not set aside for that use, it does not become sacred, and continues to be a secular object as it had been hitherto. Phylacteries may not be suspended by their thong or by the part which contains the scriptural section. But the bag containing the phylacteries may be suspended.&quot;, &quot;10. The proper time for putting on phylacteries is when it is day and not when it is night, for it is said, \\&quot;Day by day\\&quot;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Usually rendered, \\u201cfrom year to year\\u201d, referring to observance of the feast of Passover.&lt;/i&gt; (Exodus 13:10). \\&quot;The ordinance\\&quot; mentioned in this verse refers to the precept of phylacteries. So it is said, \\&quot;And it shall be for a sign\\&quot;, while Sabbaths and festivals are them-also, Sabbaths and festivals are not seasons for putting on phylacteries, for selves a sign. When is the proper time in the day to put on phylacteries? At the hour when a person can see his neighbour at a distance of four cubits and recognize him. The period extends till sunset.&quot;, &quot;11. A person who put on phylacteries before sunset, is permitted when it becomes dusk, to continue to wear them, even throughout the night. The multitude however is not to be so taught. Everyone should be instructed not to wear phylacteries at night, but to remove them at sunset. Whoever deliberately puts on phylacteries after sunset, violates a prohibition, for it is said, \\&quot;And thou shalt keep this ordinance in its season, day by day\\&quot; (Exodus 13:10).&quot;, &quot;12. If the sun sets while a man with the phylacteries on his head was on the road, he places his hand upon the phylactery till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If Sabbath or a festival arrived while he was sitting in the house of study, with the phylactery on his head, he places his hand upon it till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If there is a house near the City Wall,&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*the house of study was outside the town.&lt;/i&gt; where the phylacteries could be safely left, he should leave them there. If he did not remove them after sunset, because he had no place where they would be safe, and he kept them on for the sake of security, his conduct is lawful.&quot;, &quot;13. One who is exempt from reading the &lt;i&gt;Shema&lt;/i&gt; is exempt from putting on phylacteries. If a child less than thirteen years of age knows how to take care of his phylacteries, his father purchases a set for him, so as to train him in the practice of religious precepts. Those who suffer intestinal troubles or have difficulty in controlling their sphincters are exempt from the obligation of putting on phylacteries. All who are ritually unclean are under the same obligation of putting on phylacteries as those who are ritually clean. One, who is in pain or whose mind is not calm and composed is exempt from the duty of putting on phylacteries; for the wearer must not allow his consciousness of them to wander. Priests while engaged in the temple service, Levites during the recital of hymns in their appointed places, Israelites while they are in the Sanctuary, are exempt from the duties of reciting the prayers and putting on phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;14. As long as one is wearing phylacteries, he should frequently touch them with his fingers, so as not to lose consciousness of them for a single moment. For their degree of sanctity is higher than that of the golden plate which the High Priest wore on his forehead. On the latter, the name of God was engraved once only, while the phylactery for the head contains the tetragrammaton twenty-one times, and the phylactery for the arm, an equal number of times.&quot;, &quot;15. A requisite in wearing phylacteries is physical cleanliness. One should take care that no flatus escapes him while he has them on. Hence, he may not, while wearing them, indulge in regular sleep or even doze. But if they are covered with a cloth, he may doze, even while wearing them. How so? He places his head between his knees and dozes in a sitting posture. If his phylacteries were folded and held in his hand, the holder may even sleep in the regular way.&quot;, &quot;16. No meal, unless it be of a casual character, may be eaten, while one wears phylacteries (without previous preparation). Before proceeding to a regular meal, he removes them, places them on the table, washes his hands, puts them on again, recites the blessing for food while he has them on.&quot;, &quot;17. If one feels a call of nature while wearing phylacteries, he is not to deposit them, before entering the lavatory, in the crevices that open towards the public thoroughfare, lest passers-by may take them. How should he act? Even if he needs to relieve the bladder while he is at a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, he should remove the phylacteries, roll them up in his garment, as a scroll is rolled up, grasp them in his right hand opposite his heart, taking care that not a thong projects outside his hand as much as a hand breadth; then he enters, relieves himself, and, after having left, goes away to a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, and puts on his phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;18. This rule only applies to the case of a permanent lavatory. But one may not enter an extemporized lavatory with phylacteries even rolled up. They should be removed and given to another person for safe keeping.&quot;, &quot;19. If one wearing phylacteries needed to go to the lavatory at eventide when there would be no more time to put them on again, he should not enter with the phylacteries rolled up in his garment, even to relieve his bladder, if the lavatory is a permanent one. How should he act? He should remove the phylacteries, place them in their bag which must be at least a hand breadth long, or even in a smaller bag provided it is not specially assigned as a receptable for phylacteries. This he keeps in his hand and enters. Thus, too, at night time, if he needs to visit the lavatory, he may put the phylacteries in a bag which he keeps in his hand when entering.&quot;, &quot;20. Translation omitted.&quot;, &quot;21. Translation omitted.&quot;, &quot;22. One is permitted to put on phylacteries in that portion of a bathhouse where all are attired. In that portion where some are in their attire while others are nude, the phylacteries which one wears need not be removed, but they may not be put on. Where all are nude, the phylacteries must be removed, and needless to add, they may not be put on.&quot;, &quot;23. A person should not walk in a cemetery with phylacteries on his head. When he is within a distance of four cubits from a corpse or a grave, the phylacteries are to be removed till he has passed on to a distance outside four cubits. Phylacteries must not be put on before one is decently covered and has put on his garments. If a person is carrying a burden on his head, he must remove the phylactery from his head, and may not put it on till he has removed the burden. Even a kerchief [alone] may not be put upon the head when one is wearing phylacteries. But he puts his cap over the phylactery.&quot;, &quot;24. In a room where there are phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, marital intercourse may not take place, till these have been taken out, or placed in a receptacle which itself is enclosed in another receptacle not assigned to the use of phylacteries or a scroll of the Law. If the latter receptacle has been so assigned, and even if there be ten such receptacles, they are all regarded as one receptacle. If he placed the sacred articles in two receptacles, one within the other, they may be put for security under his pillow between the bolster and the coverlid\\u2014not however exactly beneath his head. This may be done even if his wife shares his couch.&quot;, &quot;25. The sanctity of phylacteries is a high degree of sanctity. As long as phylacteries are on a man\&#39;s head and arm, he is humble and God-fearing, is not drawn into frivolity and idle talk, does not dwell on evil thoughts but occupies his mind with thoughts of truth and righteousness. A man should therefore endeavour to wear phylacteries the whole day, this being the right way of fulfilling the precept. It is said of &lt;i&gt;Rav,&lt;/i&gt; the disciple of our Sainted Teacher (R. Judah, the Prince), that throughout his life no one saw him, without Torah, Tzitzis (fringes on his garments) or phylacteries.&quot;, &quot;26. Although the proper mode of fulfilling the precept is to wear phylacteries the whole day, it is especially a duty to do so during the recital of prayers. The sages say, \\&quot;Whoever reads the &lt;i&gt;Shema&lt;/i&gt; without wearing phylacteries is regarded as testifying falsely in his own person.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*He recites the Commandment to wear &lt;i&gt;Tephillin&lt;/i&gt; and does not fulfill it.&lt;/i&gt; Whoever does not wear phylacteries at all violates eight affirmative precepts, since in each of the four sections, the command is set forth to lay phylacteries on the head and on the arm. Whoever wears phylacteries regularly will be blessed with longevity, as it is said, \&#39;The Lord is upon them: they shall live\&#39;\\&quot; (Isaiah 38:16).&quot;], [&quot;1. How is the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**Sections of Scripture placed on doorposts.&lt;/i&gt; written? Two sections of the Pentateuch, those beginning, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4) and, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13) are written in a single column on one slip of parchment. A space of half a nail\&#39;s breadth is left as a margin above and below the column. If the Pentateuchal sections were written in two or three columns, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use. They must not however be written in the shape of a tail (broad at the top line and gradually narrowing to a point), or of a circle, or of a tent (narrow at the top and broadening to the base). A &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; written in any of these forms is unfit for use. If the text was written out of order, for example, if the second section was in front of the first, it is unfit for use. If it was written on two slips of parchment, even though these were sewn together, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use. A Scroll of the Law that has become worn out or phylacteries that are worn out may not be used for a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Nor may margins cut off from a scroll of the Law be so used; for anything dedicated to a sacred purpose may not be degraded from a higher to a lower degree of sacredness.&quot;, &quot;2. It is a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (an act of piety) to separate the section beginning, \\&quot;Hear, O Israel\\&quot; from that beginning, \\&quot;And it shall come to pass\\&quot; by a \\&quot;closed\\&quot; space (blank of nine letters). If the division between the two sections was an \\&quot;open\\&quot; one (the second section beginning a new line), the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is fit for use, as, in the Pentateuch, the second section does not immediately follow the first. Special heed should be paid to the tittles in the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; The following are the tittles which are made in the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;3. In the first section, there are seven letters, each of which should have above it three upright lines in the shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Zain.&lt;/i&gt; They are the &lt;i&gt;Shin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ayin&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Shema; Nun&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nafshecha;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Totafoth.&lt;/i&gt; The second section has six letters, each of which should have above it three &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt;-shaped lines. They are the &lt;i&gt;Gimel&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Degancha;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mezuzoth;&lt;/i&gt; the two &lt;i&gt;Teth&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Totafoth;&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;Tzadi&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Ha-aretz.&lt;/i&gt; If the tittles were omitted or if they are more or less than those specified, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; has not been rendered unfit for use. But if it was written without the lines having been ruled, or if the scribe paid no heed to &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; letters, or if he added in the text even a single letter, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;4. It is a universal custom to write the word &lt;i&gt;Shaddai&lt;/i&gt; (Almighty) on the other side of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; opposite the blank space between the two sections. As this word is written on the outside, the practice is unobjectionable. They, however, who write names of angels, holy names, a Biblical text or inscriptions usual on seals, within the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; are among those who have no portion in the world to come. For these fools not only fail to fulfill the commandment but they treat an important precept that expresses the Unity of God, the love of Him, and His worship, as if it were an amulet to promote their own personal interests; for, according to their foolish minds, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is something that will secure for them advantage in the vanities of the world.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*A reproof to those who sell Mezuzoth to be worn as amulets !&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;5. It is a &lt;i&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/i&gt; (act of piety) to write &lt;i&gt;Al Ha-aretz&lt;/i&gt; (the last two words) on the last line, either at the beginning or in the middle of the line. All the scribes follow the custom of writing the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; in twenty-two lines, and (the last two words) &lt;i&gt;Al Ha-aretz&lt;/i&gt; at the commencement of the last line. The following are the words in order, which begin each of the lines: (See the Hebrew text on the corresponding right-hand side, page 127b.)&quot;, &quot;6. When the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is folded, it is rolled up from the end of the line to the beginning, so that anyone opening it is able to read it from the beginning to the end of the line. After it has been rolled up, it is placed in a cylinder of reed, wood or other material, which is attached to the doorpost with a nail; or else a cavity is hollowed out in the doorpost, into which the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is inserted.&quot;, &quot;7. Before one affixes it to the doorpost, he recites the blessing, \\&quot;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us to affix the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah\\&quot;.&lt;/i&gt; No blessing is recited at the time when it is written, because the affixing of it constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.&quot;, &quot;8. If one suspended it on a staff, it is unfit, for this is not affixing it (to the doorpost). If one placed it behind the door, he has not fulfilled the precept. If he perforated the door and forced the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; into it like a nail, as a bolt is inserted in the staple-ring, it is unfit. If it was placed in a hollow of the doorpost at a depth of a hand-breadth, it is unfit. If one cut a stick, put a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on it, attached this stick to other sticks and made of them all a doorpost, it is unfit, because the affixing of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; preceded the erection of the doorpost.&quot;, &quot;9. The &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; of a private dwelling is examined once every seven years; that attached to a public building twice in the Jubilee (fifty years). The object is to ascertain whether a letter has been torn away or obliterated; because owing to the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; being affixed to walls, it is liable to decay.&quot;, &quot;10. The fulfillment of the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is incumbent upon all Israelites, including women and slaves (of Israelites). Children under the age of thirteen years are trained to affix the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; to their rooms. One who rents a dwelling outside the Holy Land, or lodges at an inn in the Holy Land is exempt from the obligation of affixing a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; for a period of thirty days after beginning his occupancy. But if one rents a home in the Holy Land, the duty of affixing a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; devolves immediately.&quot;, &quot;11. If one lets a dwelling to another person, the duty devolves upon the lessee to bring a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; and attach it, even if he has to pay for doing so, for the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is the personal obligation of the occupant and not an obligation attaching to the structure. When he surrenders possession, he must not, on quitting the premises, remove the Mezuzah. But if the owner is a non-Israelite, the Jewish tenant, when leaving, takes it away.&quot;], [&quot;1. There are ten conditions which must exist in a dwelling, to put the occupant under an obligation to affix a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If one of these is absent, he is exempt. These are as follows: The dwelling must have a superficial area of four cubits by four cubits or more; it must have two door-posts, a lintel, a roof and doors; the entrance should be ten hand-breadths high or more; it must be a secular (not a sacred) structure; it must have been erected for human occupancy, for honored use (not a lavatory), and built for permanent habitation.&quot;, &quot;2. A dwelling, the superficial area of which is less than four cubits by four cubits does not require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If its area is equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits, even if it is circular in shape or has five angles, or, needless to add, if its length is greater than its breadth, it requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; provided that it covers an area equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits.&quot;, &quot;3. A porch, that is a place with three walls and a roof, even though it has two uprights on the fourth side does not need a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; the uprights serving to support the roof and not as doorposts. Thus too, a roof without walls that rests on pillars on either side, even if it presents the appearance of a dwelling is exempt from the obligation of having a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; on account of its having no doorposts\\u2014the pillars having been erected to support the roof.&quot;, &quot;4. A dwelling with posts on either side (of the door), and in the place of the lintel an arch in the shape of a bow, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; provided that the posts are ten hand-breadths high or more. If they are not ten hand-breadths high, there is no such obligation, as the dwelling has no lintel.&quot;, &quot;5. A dwelling without a roof does not require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Where part of it is covered with a roof and part uncovered, it seems to me that if the portion over the entrance is roofed, the structure requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; After the doors are set up, the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is affixed.&quot;, &quot;6. The Temple Mount, its chambers and courts, synagogues and houses of study which have no residences are exempt, because they are sacred. A village synagogue in which transients lodge requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; So too, a city synagogue which has a dwelling house attached to it, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; None of the Temple entrances had a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; except the Gate of Nikanor, and the gate within that gate, and the entrance to the Chamber of Parhedrin, because this chamber was the High Priest\&#39;s residence during his seven days of seclusion (prior to the Day of Atonement).&quot;, &quot;7. A hayloft, a cattle-shed, a wood store and a barn are exempted from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because of the phrase, \\&quot;thy house\\&quot; (in the text \\&quot;thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house\\&quot;), which means a dwelling assigned to thy use and excludes the aforementioned and similar classes of buildings. Hence, a cattle-shed, where women stay adorning themselves, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because it also serves as a human habitation. A lodge or porch\\u2014either rectangular or circular\\u2014leading to a garden, a garden and a sheepfold are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because they are not constructed to serve as residences. If dwellings requiring a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; open to these places, the latter must also have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;8. Hence, entrances, whether leading to courtyards or to passages, and gates of districts or cities, must each have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because dwellings which require a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; open on to them. Even where ten rooms open one to the other, each requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; just as the innermost room requires it. This is the reason for the rule that a gate opening from the garden to a courtyard requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;9. A privy, bath-house, ritual bath-house, tannery and similar places are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; because they are not erected to serve as dwellings for honored use. The tabernacle for the feast of Tabernacles, and a room in a ship are exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; because they are not made for permanent occupancy. Of two potter\&#39;s booths, one leading to the other, the exterior is exempt from the obligation of a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah,&lt;/i&gt; because it is not permanent. Shops in market places are exempt, because they are not intended to be used as residences.&quot;, &quot;10. A dwelling with several doors, although only one is regularly used for coming in and going out, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; affixed to each door. A small door between a dwelling (below) and the attic needs a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; Every room in a dwelling, even a room within a room, must have a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; at the entrance of the inner chamber, of the outer chamber and of the house, for they all serve the purpose of residence and are permanent.&quot;, &quot;11. A door between a house of study or synagogue and a private house, if used habitually for entering and leaving, requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt; If a door is between two dwellings, the position of the hinge determines the side on which the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is to be fixed. The side on which the hinge is visible is regarded as the dwelling in reference to which the position of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; is decided.&quot;, &quot;12. Where is the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; to be fixed? Within the width of the doorpost, a hand-breadth from the external edge at a height of a third of the elevation of the entrance, counting from the top. If placed higher it is fit in position, provided that it is a hand-breadth lower than the lintel. It should be fixed on the right side of one entering; if placed on the left side, it is unfit for use. A house owned by partners requires a &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;13. A person should pay heed to the precept of the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah;&lt;/i&gt; for it is an obligation perpetually binding upon all. Whenever one enters or leaves a home with the &lt;i&gt;Mezuzah&lt;/i&gt; on the doorpost, he will be confronted with the Declaration of God\&#39;s Unity, blessed be His holy name; and will remember the love due to God, and will be aroused from his slumbers and his foolish absorption in temporal vanities. He will realize that nothing endures to all eternity save knowledge of the Ruler of the Universe. This thought will immediately restore him to his right senses and he will walk in the paths of righteousness. Our ancient teachers said: He who has phylacteries on his head and arm, fringes on his garment and a Mezuzah on his door may be presumed not to sin, for he has many monitors\\u2014angels that save him from sinning, as it is said, (Psalms 34:8) \\&quot;The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them\\&quot;.&quot;], [&quot;1. It is an affirmative precept binding upon every individual Israelite to write a scroll of the Law for his own use, as it is said, \\&quot;Now therefore write ye this Song for you\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:19). As the Torah is not written in separate sections, this text means, \\&quot;Write for yourselves the Torah in which this Song is contained.\\&quot; Even if one\&#39;s ancestors have left a person a scroll, it is a religious duty to write a scroll at his own expense. If he wrote it with his own hand, it is accounted to him as if he had received it from Sinai. If one does not know how to write a scroll, he should get others to write it for him. He who corrects a scroll, even a single letter of it, is regarded as if he had written it completely.&quot;, &quot;2. A king has the duty of writing for himself another scroll of the Law, in his capacity as sovereign, in addition to the scroll which he owns in his private capacity, as it is said, \\&quot;And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law, etc.\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:18). This copy is corrected by comparison with a scroll kept in the temple court, and under the authority of the Supreme Judicature. The scroll which the king had possessed when he was a private individual, he places in his archives. The one that he wrote or had written for him when he became king, should always be with him. If he goes to war, the scroll is to be with him. When he enters his home, it is to be with him. When he hears a cause (tries a case) it is to be with him. When he sits down to a meal, it is to be placed before him, as it is said, \\&quot;And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 17:19).&quot;, &quot;3. If he possessed no scroll before he came to the throne, he has to write, after his accession, two scrolls of the law, one of which he places in his archives, while the other is to be always with him. It must never be away from him, except at night, or when he goes to the bath or the lavatory or lies down on his couch to sleep.&quot;, &quot;4. A scroll of the Law that has been written without having been ruled, or that has been written partly on parchment made of whole hide and partly on that made of the inner half of split hide is unfit for use. It must be entirely written either on the former or on the latter. How is a scroll of the law to be written? The scribe is to use the correct script and it should also be exceedingly fine. Between one word and another, he is to leave the space of a small letter; between one letter and another (in the same word) the space of a hair\&#39;s breadth; between one line and the next the space of a line. The length of each line is to be thirty letters, wide enough to write the word Le-Mi-Sh-Pe-Ch-O-S-E-Che-M&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Ten consonant letters printed here in capital letters. See also below.&lt;/i&gt; three times. This is to be the width of each column. No line shall be shorter, so that the column shall not look like an epistle. Nor should any line be wider so that the reader\&#39;s eyes should not have to wander across the sheet.&quot;, &quot;5. He should not diminish the size of the characters in order to leave a space between one paragraph and another. When he comes (at the end of a line) to a word of five letters, he must not write two within the column and three outside the column; but he is to write three letters within the column and two outside the column. If there is not enough space left at the end of the line to write three letters, he is to leave it blank and begin at the commencement of the next line.&quot;, &quot;6. If at the end of a line, he has a word of two letters to write, he may not place it between the columns (that is, outside the column) but he writes it at the beginning of the next line. If, before the line is filled up, he has a word of ten letters, more or less, to write and there is not enough space left on the line to write it all within the column, if he is able to write half the word within the column and half outside the column, he may do so. If he cannot do this, he leaves the space blank and writes the word at the beginning of the next line.&quot;, &quot;7. Between each book and the next, he leaves a space of four lines, no more and no less, blank without any writing, and starts the next book at the beginning of the fifth line. When completing the Torah, he is to finish it in the middle of the line at the end of the column. If several lines of the column would be left, he shortens the lines, so as to begin at the beginning of the last line of the column and not complete it, and also so plans the lines that the final words &lt;i&gt;Le-\\u00e9n\\u00e9 Chol Yisrael&lt;/i&gt; (\\&quot;in the sight of all Israel\\&quot;) shall be in the middle of the line at the end of the column.&quot;, &quot;8. He should pay careful attention to the letters that are written large or small, to the letters that are punctuated with dots above them, to the letters that are written differently to the others, such as the letter P\\u00e9 and the letters that are curved, in the way the scribes have carried on the tradition. He is to pay attention to the tittles&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*lines over each of the letters &lt;i&gt;Shin, Ayin, Teth, Nuen, Zayin, Gimel, Tzadi&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; and the number of them in each case\\u2014one letter having above it a single tittle, another having seven tittles. All the tittles have the shape of the letter &lt;i&gt;Zain&lt;/i&gt; and are to be thin as a hair.&quot;, &quot;9. All these provisoes are only stated in order that the duty of writing a scroll shall be observed in the most perfect way. If, however the scribe made changes in the method here set forth, was not careful in regard to the tittles, writing however all the letters correctly, or if he wrote the lines close together or far apart, extended the lines or shortened them\\u2014since he did not join any letter to another, omit aught or add aught, mar the form of any letter, nor make any variation in regard to which paragraphs should be open and which closed, the scroll is fit for use.&quot;, &quot;10. There are other rules mentioned in the Talmud which the scribes observe as a tradition handed down from one to another. They are as follows: The number of lines in each column shall not be less than forty-eight and not more than sixty; the blank spaces between one section and another shall be such that nine letters, e.g., A She R, A She R, A She R, can be written in it. The five lines preceding the Song at the Red Sea (Exodus 14:28, 29, 30, 30, 31) shall begin respectively with the words &lt;i&gt;Habaim, Bayabashah, Hashem, Mes, Bemitzraim.&lt;/i&gt; The five lines after it shall begin respectively with the words &lt;i&gt;Vatikach, Achareha, Sus, Vayetz\\u00eb\\u00fc, Vayav\\u00f6\\u00fc&lt;/i&gt; (Exodus 15:20, 20, 21, 22, 23). The six lines before the Song of Moses beginning &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) shall respectively commence with the words &lt;i&gt;Veaeedah, Achar\\u00e9, Haderech, Beacharith, Lehacheeso, Kehal&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 31:28, 29, 29, 29, 29, 30); and the five lines after the Song of Moses shall begin with the words &lt;i&gt;Vayabo, Ledabber, Asher, Hazoth, Asher&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:44, 45, 46, 46, 47). All these points of observance are to enable us to fulfill the duty in the best way. Variations in these particulars do not render the scroll unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;11. But if the scribe wrote &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; a word that should be &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or vice versa; or a word traditionally pronounced differently to the way it is written, according to the traditional pronunciation, for example, if he wrote &lt;i&gt;Yishkevenoh&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Yishgelenoh,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Oovatechorim&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Oova-apolim,&lt;/i&gt; etc.; or if he wrote an \\&quot;open\\&quot; section as if it were a closed section or vice versa; or if he wrote one of the Songs like the ordinary prose text, or an ordinary section in the form of one of the Songs, the scroll is unfit for use as a scroll of the Law. It has not the sacredness of a scroll of the Law, but is like any one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught.&quot;, &quot;12. A scroll of the Law, which has not been examined for correctness may not be kept longer than thirty days. It must either be corrected or segregated.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*put away and not be used.&lt;/i&gt; A scroll of the Law which has three errors in each column should be corrected. If there are four, it must be put away. If the greater portion has been found to be correct, and the remainder has four errors in each column, but there is even one column in this erroneous portion with less than four errors, corrections could be made.&quot;, &quot;13. This rule only applies to cases where the scribe wrote &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; words that should be written &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; so that he would be under the necessity of inserting the letters that he forgot between the lines. But if he wrote &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; words that are &lt;i&gt;defective,&lt;/i&gt; even if every column contains several errors, he corrects them, as he only erases and does not have to insert letters between the lines.&quot;, &quot;14. It is permitted to write the Pentateuch, each book in a separate scroll. These scrolls have not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law that is complete. One may not however write a scroll containing some sections. Such a scroll may not be written for a child\&#39;s instruction. This is permitted, however, where there is the intention to complete the remainder of the book. If one wrote such a scroll with three words on each line, this is permitted.&quot;, &quot;15. The Pentateuch, the Prophets and the Hagiography may be put together in one volume. In such a case, a space of four lines is left blank between each book of the Pentateuch and the next; a space of three lines between each of the major Prophets and the next; and a space of three lines between each of the twelve minor prophets and the next, so that he can, if he wishes, separate any book. The order of the prophetical books is as follows: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah, the Twelve Minor Prophets. The order of the books of the Hagiography is: Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel, Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.&quot;, &quot;16. None of The Holy Scriptures may be written except on ruled lines, even if they are written on paper: Three words of Scripture may be written without ruling the line, but to write more is forbidden. A volume containing the Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiography has not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, but of a single book of the Pentateuch. The scroll which contains more than the entire Pentateuch is in the same class as that which contains less than the entire Pentateuch, on the principle that excess is similar to deficiency.&quot;], [&quot;1. The &lt;i&gt;open&lt;/i&gt; section has two forms. If the previous section ended in the middle of a line, the scribe leaves the remainder of the line blank and commences the open section at the beginning of the next line. This only applies to the case where, after the conclusion of the previous section, there is left sufficient space on the line to write nine letters. But if the space left is less, or if the previous section was completed at the end of the line, the next line must be left blank, and the open section is begun at the commencement of the third line.&quot;, &quot;2. A &lt;i&gt;closed&lt;/i&gt; section has three forms. If the previous section ended within the line, the scribe leaves a blank space for the required dimension (enough to write nine letters) and begins the closed section at the end of the line, provided that there is a blank space between it and the preceding section. If the completion of the previous section did not leave space for the blank of the required breadth and for writing (at least) one word at the end of the line, the scribe should leave the remainder of the line blank, leave a little space at the beginning of the next line blank, and begin the closed section within the line. If the previous section ended at the close of the line, he leaves a blank space of the required breadth (nine letters), at the beginning of the next line, and begins to write the closed section within the line. Hence, you may say that an open section always begins within the line.&quot;, &quot;3. A scroll which is inaccurate in regard to words that are written &lt;i&gt;plene&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;defective&lt;/i&gt; can be made good by being corrected, as already explained. But if the scribe made a mistake in the spacing between the sections, and wrote an open section as if it were a closed section, or a closed section as if it were an open section or left a space where a section does not end, or continued writing without leaving a space where a section ends, or deviated from the form in which the Songs are written, in all these cases, the Scroll is unfit for use and there is no remedy except to remove the entire column in which the mistake occurs.&quot;, &quot;4. As in all the scrolls I have seen, I noticed serious incorrectness in these regards, while authorities on the Massorah, who write treatises and compilations with the aim of pointing out the sections that are closed and those that are open, differ according to the variations in the scrolls on which they rely, I deemed it fit to write here a list of the sections which are closed and those which are open, as also the forms in which the Songs of the Pentateuch are written so that all the scrolls may be corrected from, and compared with them. The copy on which I relied is the well-known Egyptian codex which contains the twenty-four books of the Scriptures and which had been in Jerusalem for several years\\u2014used as the standard text for the examination of scrolls. Everyone relied upon it because it had been examined by Ben Asher who closely studied it for many years and examined it again whenever it was being copied. This codex was the text on which I relied in the scroll of the Law that I wrote according to the rules.&quot;, &quot;(Here follow lists of open and closed sections which are in the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 131b to 136b.)&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF GENESIS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 43; of closed sections 48; total 91.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF EXODUS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 69; of closed sections, 95; total 164.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 52; of closed sections, 46; total 98.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF NUMBERS&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections is 92; of closed sections, 66; total 158.&quot;, &quot;THE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY&quot;, &quot;The number of open sections of this book is 34; of closed sections, 124, total 158. The number of open sections in the entire Pentateuch is 290; of the closed sections, 379; total 669.&quot;, &quot;The form of the Song &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43). Every line has a blank space in the middle, like that preceding a closed section. Hence, every line is divided into two parts. The song is written in 70 lines. The words at the beginning of the lines are as follows:&quot;, &quot;(See the Hebrew text on the right hand side page 136a)&quot;, &quot;All these are the words at the beginning of the lines. And the following are the words at the beginning of the latter half of the line which are in the middle of the column.&quot;, &quot;(See the Hebrew text on the right hand pages 136a and 136b)&quot;, &quot;The Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15:1-19) is written in thirty lines, the first line in the ordinary way; the other lines, one with a blank space in the middle, the next with blank spaces in two places, so that the line is divided into three parts and so a blank space corresponds to writing (above and below it) and vice versa as follows.&quot;, &quot;See the Hebrew text on the right-hand side 136a, 136b and 137a as it should be written in the scroll. The English pages should be blank.&quot;, &quot;Throughout the Torah, in the Songs as well as in the rest of the text, the scribe should aim to write all the letters of each word close together, taking care that no letter should be joined to another, and that no letter should be so far away from the next as to make the word seem two words. The interval between the letters in one word should be a hairbreadth. If the scribe wrote one letter so far apart from the other that it would appear to a child who is not familiar with the text like two words, the scroll is unfit for use till he makes the correction.&quot;], [&quot;1. The length of a scroll of the Law should not exceed the circumference, nor should the circumference exceed the length. What is a suitable length? Where parchment of a whole hide is used, six hand-breadths, that is twenty-four finger-breadths taking the thumb as the standard. Where the parchment of the external half of the hide is used, the length may be more or less than this dimension, provided only that the length is equal to the circumference. So also in the case of parchment of a whole hide, if the scribe made the length less than six hand-breadths and wrote in a small hand or longer than six handbreadths and spread out the writing so that the length of the column is equal to the circumference\\u2014this too is correct.&quot;, &quot;2. The extent of the lower margin is four finger-breadths; of the upper margin, three finger-breadths; between one column and another, two finger-breadths. Hence, on the right and left of every sheet of parchment, the scribe has to leave a margin a finger-breadth wide and enough beside for sewing; so that, when the sheets are sewn together, there will be throughout the scroll a blank space of two finger-breadths between the columns. The scribe must leave in addition enough margin at the beginning and end of the scroll to fold a blank column round the rollers. All these dimensions are to be observed in order to fulfill the precept properly. But if the scribe exceeded or fell short of them, he does not render the scroll unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;3. How shall one proceed so that the length of the scroll shall turn out equal to its circumference. The parchment sheets are made evenly rectangular; each sheet being six handbreadths wide, all of the same dimensions. They are rolled evenly into one bundle tightly rolled up. And skins are added and tightly rolled till the circumference is six handbreadths, which is the width of the sheets. This is measured with a thread of wool which is placed round the bundle.&quot;, &quot;4. The scribe then fashions a straight ruler, forty or fifty finger-breadths long; one of these finger-breadths, he marks in two, three and four equal parts so as to be able to measure off a half, a third and a quarter of a finger-breadth and similar fractions. With this, he measures each sheet, so as to ascertain the number of finger-breadths it contains and so determine how many finger-breadths there are in the entire bundle.&quot;, &quot;5. He then takes two or three other sheets of parchment, to test the size of the characters, and writes on them one column. The length of a column of writing is obviously seventeen finger-breadths as a margin must be left, of three finger-breadths above and four finger-breadths below. The width of the column will depend on the handwriting, whether it is large or small. So also, the number of lines will vary according to the handwriting, as between each line and the next, the space of a line must be left.&quot;, &quot;6. Having written the column which he uses as a test as he pleases, he measures its breadth by means of the finger-breadths of the ruler, and adds two finger-breadths for the margin between column and column. He then calculates how many columns of such writing would fill the sheets in the bundle he had made up. Having ascertained the total number of columns, he will then see how much of the entire Pentateuch is in the column which he wrote as a test. He will make the estimate with the aid of the scroll which serves him as a copy, and calculate accordingly. If the number of columns of the kind of writing which he wrote is sufficient for the whole Torah\\u2014well and good. If the calculation showed that there are more columns than are required for the whole Torah, he will enlarge the writing, so as to diminish the number of columns, and he will make a test with another column. If the calculation shows that for the writing of the Torah more columns will be required than are contained in his sheets, he will use smaller characters and so secure a larger number of columns. He will make the test with column after column till the calculation comes out exact.&quot;, &quot;7. Once he knows the width of the column and the size of the characters, he can begin writing the scroll with that bundle of sheets. He then divides the parchment (sheets) into columns by ruling them off,\\u2014each column of the same width as that which his tests and calculations showed to be the right size. If three or four finger-breadths are left over beyond the last column, he should leave one finger-breadth and enough besides for sewing the sheet to the next, and cut off the rest, and need feel no apprehension, for at the end, more sheets will be added to make up for the superfluous strips that he cut off from each sheet. Nor need he make any calculations in regard to this, for the writing will be according to the number of columns.&quot;, &quot;8. So too, if one wishes to make the width of the scroll more or less than six handbreadths, he makes his calculation in the same way; and the length will be exactly equal to the circumference neither more nor less, provided that no mistake has been made in the calculation.&quot;, &quot;9. The finger-breadth in all the dimensions here and in the rest of the Torah is that of the medium sized finger. On careful examination, we find it to be the breadth of seven medium sized barley corns placed close together, this being equal to the length of two barley corns measured liberally. The handbreadth, wherever mentioned, is equal to four such finger-breadths. A cubit is six handbreadths.&quot;, &quot;10. The scroll which I wrote had a width of four finger-breadths to each column. The columns containing the Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15.1-18) &lt;i&gt;Haazinu&lt;/i&gt; (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) were each six finger-breadths wide. The number of lines in each column were fifty-one. The number of columns in the whole scroll were 226 columns. The length of the entire scroll was 13366 finger-breadths approximately.&quot;, &quot;11. The six finger-breadths left over were for the margin at the beginning and end of the scroll. The parchment skins on which we wrote were ramskins. Whenever you desire to write a scroll and follow these measurements completely or approximately, you need not weary yourself to make a calculation if you have one, two or three columns less or more; you will find that the length will be equal to the circumference.&quot;, &quot;12. No sheet should have less than three, nor more than eight columns. If a sheet is wide enough to contain nine columns, it is cut into two parts, one to contain four columns, the other to contain five columns. This rule applies to the beginning and middle of the scroll. But at the close, even if there is only left one verse to write on a column, that column is prepared on a separate sheet and sewn on to the other sheets.&quot;, &quot;13. For sewing the sheets together, only the sinews of a clean beast domestic or wild, including those that are &lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Terefah&lt;/i&gt; (literally torn), flesh of a beast that had suffered from a mortal lesion.&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Nevelah&lt;/i&gt;\\u2014flesh of a beast that had died or had not been slaughtered, or had been slaughtered by an unqualified or disqualified person.&lt;/i&gt; may be used. The law here is the same as in regard to phylacteries. This rule goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. Hence if the sheets have been sewn together but not with sinews or with sinews of an unclean animal, the scroll is unfit for use till the stitches are taken out and the sewing is done according to rule.&quot;, &quot;14. When the sheets are sewn together, they are sewn entirely from top to bottom, but a small portion is left above and below without being stitched, so that the scroll, when it is rolled up, may not be torn in the middle. Two wooden rollers are prepared, one for either end. The unwritten margins of parchment at the beginning and at the end are brought round the rollers and sewn with sinews, so that the scroll can be rolled over them; a clear space being left between the margin and the writing in the columns.&quot;, &quot;15. In case a scroll of the law had one of its sheets torn, the rent is sewn up, if it extends to two lines; if it extends to three lines, it is not sewn up. This rule applies to a scroll the gall dressing of which is no longer perceptible. But if the parchment still shows that it has been dressed, then, even when the rent extends to three lines, it is sewn up. So too, a rent between columns or between words is sewn up. For the stitching of the rents, the same kind of sinews are used as for the sheets. And wherever there is a rent, the scribe should make sure that no letter is missing or altered in form.&quot;], [&quot;1. You thus find that there are twenty factors, any one of which disqualifies a scroll of the law. If any of these occurs, the scroll is like one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught. It does not possess the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, and is not used for reading in public worship. They are as follows:&quot;, &quot;1) If it was written on the skin of a beast of an unclean species;&quot;, &quot;2) or on the skin of a beast of a clean species, which had not been tanned;&quot;, &quot;3) If the skin had been tanned but not for the express purpose of being used as a scroll of the law;&quot;, &quot;4) If it was written on the wrong side; in the case of parchment of whole hide on the side next to the flesh; in the case of parchment of the outer half of a split hide, on the side adjacent to the hair;&quot;, &quot;5) If it was written partly on parchment of whole hide and partly on that made of the outer half of split hide;&quot;, &quot;6) If it was written on the inner half of a split hide;&quot;, &quot;7) If it was written without the lines having been previously ruled;&quot;, &quot;8) If it was written with a dark writing fluid that does not make a permanent impression;&quot;, &quot;9) If it was written in other languages;&quot;, &quot;10) If it was written by a heretic (Epikouros) or other disqualified persons;&quot;, &quot;11) If the scribe wrote the names of God without special concentration of mind;&quot;, &quot;12) If a single letter was omitted;&quot;, &quot;13) If a single letter was added;&quot;, &quot;14) If one letter touched another;&quot;, &quot;15)\\tIf a single letter was so marred that it cannot be read at all, or resembles another letter, whether the defect is in the writing, or is due to a perforation, rent or smudge;&quot;, &quot;16)\\tIf the scribe wrote letters so far apart or so closely together that one word looks like two words or two words look like one word;&quot;, &quot;17)\\tIf he altered the form of the sections&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=\\&quot;footnote\\&quot;&gt;*Wrote an \\u201copen\\u201d section as if it were a \\u201cclosed\\u201d section or vice versa.&lt;/i&gt;;&quot;, &quot;18)\\tIf he varied the form of writing the Songs;&quot;, &quot;19)\\tIf he wrote any other portion in the form of a Song;&quot;, &quot;20)\\tIf he did not sew the sheets with sinews of a beast of a clean species.&quot;, &quot;The other conditions stated are recommended as the best way of performing the duty of writing a scroll. Their non-observance does not render it unfit for use.&quot;, &quot;2. A scroll of the law that is fit for use is to be regarded as an object of extreme holiness and treated with great reverence. A person is forbidden to sell a scroll of the law even if he has nothing to eat, and even if he owns other scrolls. He may not even sell an old scroll, to buy a new one. A scroll may only be sold for one of two purposes, to provide means to enable one to study Torah or to marry\\u2014and then only if the owner has nothing else that he can sell.&quot;, &quot;3. If a scroll of the law has become worn out or been otherwise rendered unfit for use; it is placed in an earthenware vessel and buried beside the remains of deceased scholars. This is the appropriate method of \\&quot;concealing\\&quot; it (putting it away). Folders of scrolls that have become worn out are used as shrouds for the dead (found on the road) whose interment is a duty binding on all. This is the appropriate method of \\&quot;concealing\\&quot; them.&quot;, &quot;4. A case specially made for a scroll of the law and in which it has been placed, bands around the scrolls, the chest or structure in which it is deposited even though the scroll is in its case, as also a bench specially made on which to place a scroll of the law, and on which a scroll was placed are all subsidiaries of that which is sacred, and may not be thrown away. When worn out or broken, they are \\&quot;put away\\&quot;. The platforms, however, on which the Reader of the congregation stands and holds the scroll and tablets on which (scriptures) are written for a child\&#39;s instruction have no sanctity. Golden and silver pomegranates and other such ornaments, made for the embellishment of a scroll of the law are subsidiaries of that which is sacred; and it is forbidden to part with them to be used for secular purposes, unless they were sold with the intention to purchase with their proceeds a scroll of the law or a book of the Pentateuch.&quot;, &quot;5. It is permitted to place one scroll of the law upon another scroll, or, needless to add, upon single books of the Pentateuch. Single books of the Pentateuch may be placed upon books of the Prophets or Hagiography. But the books of the prophets and of the Hagiography are not placed upon single books of the Pentateuch; nor the latter on a scroll of the law. No sacred writings, not even Halachas or Hagadas (Legalistic or Homiletic works) may be thrown away. Amulets which contain scriptural matter, must not be taken with one into a lavatory (privy) unless they are covered with a skin.&quot;, &quot;6. A person may not, while bearing a scroll of the law in his arms, enter a bath-house, lavatory, or cemetery, even if the scroll is swathed in folders and placed in its case. A person must not read in it till he has moved away four cubits from the dead body (bath house) or lavatory. One may not hold a scroll of the law when nude. It is forbidden to sit down on a couch on which there is a scroll of the law.&quot;, &quot;7. Cohabitation is forbidden in a chamber where there is a scroll of the law, till it has been removed or placed in a receptacle which is itself placed in a receptacle not specially assigned to the scroll. If it has however been so assigned, even ten receptacles within each other, are regarded as a single receptacle. If a partition, ten handbreadths high, has been constructed for the scroll, cohabitation may take place if there is no other room. It may not take place, if there is another room, till the scroll has been removed.&quot;, &quot;8. All who are ritually unclean, even women in their menstruating period, and even a non-Israelite, may hold a scroll of the law and read in it, for the words of the Torah do not contract uncleanliness, provided that the holder\&#39;s hands are not dirty or soiled. They must therefore wash their hands and then they may touch it.&quot;, &quot;9. Every one who sees a person carrying a scroll of the law and proceeding with it must stand up before it; and all persons continue standing till the bearer of the scroll stops, having carried it to its appointed place, or passes out of sight. They are then permitted to resume their seats.&quot;, &quot;10. It is a duty to assign a fixed place for a scroll of the law, and to show it extreme honor and courtesy. The words in the tables of the covenant are in every scroll of the law. One may not expectorate before a scroll of the law, nor indecently expose oneself before it, nor stretch out one\&#39;s feet before it; nor place it upon the head in the way in which a burden is carried; nor turn one\&#39;s back to it unless it is at an elevation of ten handbreadths above the person.&quot;, &quot;11. If one is travelling from place to place and had a scroll of the law with him, he is not to put the scroll in a sack, place it on the donkey\&#39;s back and ride upon it. If, however, he is afraid of thieves, he may do so. When there is no such apprehension, he places it in his bosom close to his heart, and continues his journey, riding. Any one, sitting before a scroll of the law, should be inspired with a sense of earnestness, awe and reverence, for it is a faithful witness concerning all who come into the world, as it is said, \\&quot;It shall be therefore a witness against thee\\&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:26). All possible honor should be shown it. The ancient sages said, \\&quot;Whoever treats the Torah with contumely will be treated with contumely by his fellow-creatures. Whoever honors the Torah, will receive honor from his fellow creatures\\&quot; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:8). End of the laws concerning the scroll of the Law by the Grace of God.&quot;]], &quot;versionTitle&quot;: &quot;The Mishneh Torah by Maimonides. trans. by Moses Hyamson, 1937-1949&quot;, &quot;versionSource&quot;: &quot;http://primo.nli.org.il/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=NLI&amp;docId=NNL_ALEPH002108865&quot;, &quot;language&quot;: &quot;en&quot;}&#39;</pre></td>
