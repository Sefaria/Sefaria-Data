<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Then should I not be ashamed, when I have regard unto all Thy Commandments&#x201D;. (Ps. 119.6.)</p>
<p>All of the commandments which were given to Moses on Sinai were given together with their oral explanation for, it is said: &#x201C;And I will give thee the tables of stone, and the Torah and the commandment&#x201D; (Ex. 24.12.); the Torah, is Holy Writ; and the commandment, its oral explanation.</p>
<p>Moreover, He commanded us to observe the Torah by the word of the commandment; thus it is this commandment which is called Oral Torah.</p>
<p>The whole Torah was written by Moses our Master, before his demise, by his own hand; and he gave a Book to each and every tribe, and one Book he deposited in the Ark as testimony, even as it is said; &#x201C;Take this Book of the Torah and put it by the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there as a witness against thee&#x201D; (Deut. 32.26.); but the commandment, which is the oral explanation of the Torah, he did not reduce to writing, but he charged the Elders and Joshua and the rest of all Israel concerning its observance, even as it is said: &#x201C;All the word which I command you, that shall ye observe to do&#x201D; (Ibid. 23.1.); therefore, is this word of the commandment called, Oral Torah.</p>
<p>Although the Oral Torah was not reduced to writing, Moses our Master gave instructions in its full scope at his tribunal-seat, to seventy Elders. Eleazar, Phinehas and Joshua, all the three of them received it from Moses; yet, unto Joshua, because he was the disciple of Moses our Master, he transmitted the Oral Torah and charged him concerning its observance. Joshua likewise continued throughout his lifetime to study it orally; and many Elders received it from Joshua. Eli received it from the Elders and from Phinehas; Samuel received it from Eli and his tribunal; David received it from Samuel and his tribunal; Ahijah the Shiloite<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> who was among those who went forth out of Egypt, and a Levite, heard Moses expounding it; but, as he was an infant in the days of Moses, he became the recipient from David and his tribunal; Elijah received it from Ahijah the Shiloite and his tribunal; Elisha received it from Elijah and his tribunal; Jehoiadah the priest received it from Elisha and his tribunal; Zechariah received it from Jehoiadah and his tribunal; Hosea received it from Zechariah and his tribunal; Amos received it from Hosea and his tribunal; Isaiah received it from Amos and his tribunal; Micha received it from Isaiah and his tribunal; Joel received it from Micha and his tribunal; Nahum received it from Joel and his tribunal; Habakkuk received it from Nahum and his tribunal; Zephaniah received it from Habakkuk and his tribunal; Jeremiah received it from Zephaniah and his tribunal; Baruch son of Neriah received it from Jeremiah and his tribunal; Ezra and his tribunal received it from Baruch son of Neriah and his tribunal. The members of Ezra&#x2019;s tribunal are called Men of the Great Assembly, namely: Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, Azariah, Nehemiah son of Hacaliah, Mordecai, Bilshan<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup>, Zerubbable and many other scholars with them, totaling the number of an hundred and twenty Elders. The last surviving Elder of among them was Simeon the Just, who was included among the one hundred and twenty, and received the Oral Torah from all of them, and succeeded Ezra to the High Priesthood. Antigonus of Soko and his tribunal, received it from Simeon the Just and his tribunal; Jose son of Joezer of Zereda and Joseph son of Johanan of Jerusalem and their tribunal, received it from Antigonus and his tribunal; Joshua son of Perahya and Nittai of Arebela and their tribunal, received it from Jose son of Joezer and Joseph son of Johanan and their tribunal; Judah son of Tabbai and Simeon son of Shetah and their tribunal, received it from Joshua son of Perahyah and Nittai of Arebela and their tribunal; Shemaiah and Abtalion the Just Proselytes and their tribunal, received it from Judah and Simeon and their tribunal; Hillel and Shammai and their tribunal, received it from Shemaiah and Abtalion and their tribunal; Rabbin Johanan son of Zakkai and Simeon son of Hillel the Elder<sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup>, received it from Hillel and (Shammai) and their (his) tribunal(s). Rabbin Johanan son of Zakkai had five disciples who were the greatest among the scholars to receive it from him, they are: Rabbi Eliezer the Great<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup>, Rabbi Joshua<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup>, Rabbi Jose the Priest<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup>, Rabbi Simeon son of Nathaniel, and Rabbi Eleazar son of Arak. Rabbi Akiba son of Joseph received it from Rabbi Eliezer the Great, and his father Joseph was a just proselyte; Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Meir<sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup> son of the just proselyte, received it from Rabbi Akiba; Rabbi Meir and his Associates, however, received it also from Rabbi Ishmael. These are the names of Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s Associates; Rabbi Judah<sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup>, Rabbi Jose<sup><xref rid="fn9">9</xref></sup> Rabbi Simeon<sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup>, Rabbi Nehemiah<sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup>, Rabbi Eleazar son of Shamua, Rabbi Johanan ha-Sandler, Simeon son of Azai and Hananajah son of Teradion. The associates of Rabbi Akiba also received it from Rabbi Eliezar the Great. The associates of Rabbi Akiba are: Rabbi Tarphon Master of Jose the Galilean, Simeon son of Eleazar and Johanan son of Nuri. Rabbin Gamaliel the Elder received it from Simeon son of Hillel the Elder; his son, Simeon received it from him; from him, his son Rabbin Gamaliel<sup><xref rid="fn12">12</xref></sup> received it; from him, his son Rabbin Simeon received it; and Judah, the son of this Rabbin Simeon, is he who is called our Holy Master; and he received it from his father, and from Eleazar son of Shamua and from Rabbi Simen<sup><xref rid="fn13">13</xref></sup> his Associates.</p>
<p>Our Holy Master compiled the Mishna. From the days of Moses our Master till our Holy Master no text book of the Oral Torah for public instruction had been issued, the practice theretofore being for the president of a tribunal or a prophet who flourished in a given generation to keep privately written memoranda of his Masters&#x2019; oral teachings, out of which he, in turn, instructed the public orally. Like practice was resorted to by each and every individual scholar to write down, according to his ability of understanding the exposition on the Torah and its laws, as he heard it. So was also the practice in preserving new acts in each and every generation which were not based on tradition but upon one of the thirteen hermeneutical rules, to which the Great Tribunal had assented.</p>
<p>This procedure was followed continuously until the advent of our Holy Master, and he collected all traditional precedents, judicial pronouncements, expositions and explanations, whether they were traditionally attributed to Moses our Master or whether they were so instructed by the tribunals in each and every generation, the scope of which embraced the whole Torah, and from it all he compiled the Book of the Mishna, out of which he gave public instruction to scholars, and its fame reached to all Israel, and written copies of it were made universally, and its circulation reached everywhere, so that the Oral Torah be not forgotten from the midst of Israel.</p>
<p>But why did our Holy Master thus, and did not leave the matter as it was heretofore? Because he observed that the number of students continued to decrease, whereas the volume of oppression continued to increase with renewed strength; that the Roman Empire continued to spread out its boundaries in the world and conquer, whereas Israel continued to drift aimlessly and follow extremes, he, therefore, compiled one book, a handy volume for all, so that they may study it even in haste and not forget it. And his whole lifetime, he sat together with the members of his tribunal and gave public instruction in the Mishna. And these are the great scholars who were members of our Holy Master&#x2019;s tribunal, and who received it from him; Simon and Gamaliel his sons, Rabbi Aphos<sup><xref rid="fn14">14</xref></sup>, Rabbi Hanina son of Hama, Rabbi Hiyya<sup><xref rid="fn15">15</xref></sup>, Rab<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup>, Rabbi Yannai<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup>, Bar Koppara<sup><xref rid="fn18">18</xref></sup>, Samuel<sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup>, Rabbi Johanan<sup><xref rid="fn20">20</xref></sup>, and Rabbi Hoshaia<sup><xref rid="fn21">21</xref></sup>. They were the principal scholars who received it from him, but along with them were thousands even tens of thousands of among the rest of his contemporary scholars.</p>
<p>Although all of these eleven scholars received it from our Holy Master and regularly attended his lectures, Rabbi Johanan was then in his minority, and thereafter became the disciple of Rabbi Yannai from whom he received the Oral Torah. So did Rab<sup><xref rid="fn22">22</xref></sup> receive it from Rabbi Yannai; but Samuel<sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup> received it from Hanina son of Hama.</p>
<p>Rab compiled the Sifra and Sifre to elucidate and proclaim the principles of the Mishna; Rabbi Hiyya compiled the Tosefta to elucidate the treatises of the Mishna; Rabbi Hoshaiah and Bar Koppara compiled the Braitot to elucidate the texts of the Mishna; and Rabbi Johanan compiled the Jerusalemean Talmud in Eretz Yisrael, close to the third century after the destruction of the (Second) Temple.</p>
<p>Among the principal scholars who received the Oral Torah from Rab and Samuel were: Rab Huna, Rab Judah, Rab Nahman and Rab Kahana: and among the principal scholars who received it from Rabbi Johanan were: Rabba Bar Bar Hana<sup><xref rid="fn24">24</xref></sup>, Rab Ami, Rab Assi, Rab Dimi, and Rab Abin. Among the scholars who received it from Rab Huna and Rab Judah were: Rabba<sup><xref rid="fn25">25</xref></sup> and Rab Joseph; among the scholars who received it from Rabba and Rab Joseph were: Abayya and Raba, yet both of them received it also from Rab Nahman; among the scholars who received it from Raba were: Rab Ashi and Rabina; and Mar the son of Rab Ashi received it from his father and from Rabina.</p>
<p>Consequently there are forty intervening generations from Rab Ashi till Moses our Master, peace be to him! namely: (1) Rab Ashi received the Oral Torah from Raba; (2) Raba from Rabba; (3) Rabba from Rab Huna; (4) Rab Huna from Rabbi Johanan and from Rab and Samuel; (5) Rabbi Johanan and Rab and Samuel from our Holy Master; (6) our Holy Master from Rabbi Simeon his father; (7) Rabbi Simeon from his father Rabbin Gamaliel; (8) Rabbin Gamaliel from his father Rabbin Simeon; (9) Rabbin Simeon from his father Rabbin Gamaliel the Elder; (10) Rabbin Gamaliel the Elder from his father Rabbin Simeon; (11) Rabbin Simeon from his father Hillel and from Shammai; (12) Hillel and Shamai from Shemaiah and Abtalion; (13) Shemaiah and Abtalion from Judah and Simeon; (14) Judah and Simeon from Joshua son of Perahyah and Nittai of Arbela; (15) Joshua and Nittai from Jose son of Joezer and Joseph son of Johanan; (16) Jose son of Joezer and Joseph son of Johanan from Antigonus (17) Antigonus from Simeon the Just; (18) Simeon the Just from Ezra; (19) Ezra from Baruch; (20) Baruch from Jeremiah; (21) Jeremiah from Zephanaiah; (22) Zephanaiah from Habakkuk; (23) Habakkuk from Nahum; (24) Nahum from Joel; (25) Joel from Micha; (26) Micha from Isaiah; (27) Isaiah from Amos; (28) Amos from Hosea; (29) Hosea from Zachariah; (30) Zachariah from Jehoiadah; (31) Jehoiadah from Elisha; (32) Elisha from Elijah; (33) Elijah from Ahijah; (34) Ahijah from David; (35) David from Samuel; (36) Samuel from Eli; (37) Eli from Phinehas; (38) Phinehas from Joshua; (39) Joshua from Moses our Master; (40) Moses our Master from the Word of Almighty. Thus it is established that all of them received it from the Lord God of Israel.</p>
<p>All of the hereinabove named scholars were the greatest men in their respective generations; some were heads of schools, others exilarchs, and still others heads of the Great Sanhedrin; and with them were their contemporaries in each and every generation numbering in the thousands, even tens of thousands who heard the Oral Torah being expounded together with them, or received it from them.</p>
<p>Rabina and RabAshi flourished at the close of the era of Talmudic scholars. Rab Ashi is he who compiled the Babylonian Talmud in the land of Shinar about a century after Rabbi Johanan compiled the Jerusalemean Talmud.</p>
<p>The scope of both Talmudic works comprises an exposition defining the text of the Mishna, elucidatory commentaries upon its complexities, and a survey of the legal precedents established by the succeeding tribunals during the intervening period between our Holy Master and the compilation of the Talmud. And, out of both Talmudic works, the Tosefta, Sifra, Sifre (and Additions), from it all is derived what is forbidden and what is permitted, what is polluted and what is clean, what is guilt and what is innocence, what is disqualified and what is fit, all as it was transmitted orally from man to man, from the mouth of Moses our Master, even from Sinai.</p>
<p>Therefrom are also derived the edicta issued by the scholars and prophets in each and every generation to safeguard the Torah itself, as they heard it clearly from Moses, saying: &#x201C;Therefore shall ye keep my charge&#x201D; (Lev. 18.30.), which means, &#x201C;Build a fence around My Guard&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn26">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Likewise are the customs and by-laws, which were inaugurated and enacted in each and every generation, by authority of the tribunal of a given generation derived therefrom. Moreover, it is forbidden to deviate from them, even as it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall declare unto thee, to the right hand, nor to the left&#x201D; (Deut. 17.11.). Similarly are derived therefrom such laws and judicial pronouncements, otherwise not accredited by tradition to Moses, but legislated by a tribunal of a given generation upon authority of the rules by which the Torah is expounded, and were passed upon their merits by the Elders, who decided that such should be the law. The entire scope of it all, extending from the days of Moses even to his day, Rab Ashi compiled.</p>
<p>In addition, the scholars of the Mishnaic period compiled divers works of exegesis on the text of the Torah. Rabbi Hoshaia, a disciple of our Holy Master, compiled an exegetical work on the Book of Genesis; Rabbi Ishmael compiled a work of commentaries extending from Exodus till the end of the Torah; this work is called Mehilta; Rabbi Akiba, too, compiled a Mehilta; and other scholars, in a later period, compiled Midrashic literature; but all of those were edited prior to the compilation of the Babylonian Talmud.</p>
<p>Consequently, Rabina and Rab Ashi and their Associates were the last of the great scholars in Israel who edited the Oral Torah, issued edicts, enacted statutes and established customs; and their edicts, statutes, and customs were universally accepted by Israel in all the places of their habitation.</p>
<p>After the tribunal of Rab Ashi, who compiled the Talmud, which was completed in the days of his son<sup><xref rid="fn27">27</xref></sup>, the extent of Israel&#x2019;s dispersion throughout the lands became more general, its extreme points reaching out to distant isles, in the midst of which universal unrest became alarming, making the highways unsafe on account of military operations, as a result of which the study of the Torah was neglected, and the sons of Israel ceased flocking to their schools in the thousands and in the tens of thousands as theretofore, save only the gathering of a remnant few, who ever hear the call of God in each and every city and in each and every country and study the Torah and understand all the works of the scholars and learn to know therefrom the path of the law as it is. Thus, every tribunal, founded during the post-Talmudic era in each and every country which issued edicts, or enacted statutes, or established customs, either for the inhabitants of its own country alone or for the inhabitants of many countries, did not have its authority extended throughout all Israel, because of the great distances between their habitations and the unsafe condition of the highways. Moreover, as the tribunal of a given state consisted of individual scholars only, for the Great Tribunal of seventy one had ceased to be many years before the compilation of the Talmud, the people of one state could therefore, not be forced to inaugurate the custom of another state; neither could one tribunal be told to issue edicts similar to the edicts issued by another tribunal for its own state. Likewise, if one of the Gaonim instructed concerning a given law in a particular way, and it became clear to another tribunal which rose up after him, that such was not the way of the law according to the text of the Talmud, the first one is not supported but the one whose interpretation is based upon sound reasoning, whether he be the first one or the last one.</p>
<p>These rules apply only to laws, edicts, statutes and customs which were inaugurated during the post-Talmudic era; but all matters named in the Babylonian Talmud itself, are mandatory upon all Israel to follow, and each and every community and each and every state must be forced to inaugurate the customs which were promulgated by the Talmudic scholars, to proclaim their edicts and to obey their statutes, because to all such matters so named in the Talmud, all Israel assented. Moreover, those scholars who enacted statutes, issued edicts, inaugurated customs or made judicial pronouncements and instructed that such was the law, constituted all, or a majority of the scholars in Israel, and they were the recipients of the traditional interpretation of the precepts of the whole Torah, generation after generation, even unto Moses our Master, peace be unto him!</p>
<p>All of the scholars who rose up after the compilation of the Talmud and builded upon it, thereby gaining fame for their scholarship, are called Gaonim. All the Gaonim who flourished in Eretz Yisrael, in the land of Shinar, in Spain and in France studied searchingly the path of the Talmud, and brought to light its hidden mysteries, and clarified its treatises, for its path is an extremely deep path, Moreover, being written in Aramaic, blended with other languages, a vernacular understood by the inhabitants of Shinar when the Talmud was compiled; whereas in other places, and even in Shinar during the period of the Gaonim, no man understood that language unless he received special instructions therein. In addition the people of each and every city propounded many questions to their contemporary Gaonim for the elucidation of impenetrable texts in the Talmud, to whom the latter responded according to their wisdom, and such interrogators collected the responsa in book form, out of which they gained understanding. The Gaonim in each and every generation compiled also exegetical works on the Talmud, some of among them interpreted particular laws; of among others particular chapters which had been the subject of inquiry in his days, and of among still others, whole Tractates and Orders. They also compiled treatises on judicial decisions concerning that which is forbidden, or permitted, guilt or innocence, matters which were the need of the hour, so as to keep in touch with education, even he who is not capable of penetrating the depths of the Talmud. Of such was the Godly work of the Gaonim in Israel from the close of the Talmud even till this time, which is in the eighth year after the eleventh century since the destruction of the (Second) Temple, and which is also the year four thousand nine hundred and thirty-seven since the creation of the world.</p>
<p>In this age, with afflictions mightily intensified, the pressure of the hour weighing heavily upon everybody, when the wisdom of our wise did perish and the prudence of our prudent was hid, all commentaries, treatises, and responsa which the Gaonim compiled and considered by them as clear text are preplexities in our day and only a select few comprehend the subject matter thereof, not to speak of the Talmud itself, both the Babylonian and the Jerusalemean, the Sifra, Sifre and Tosefta, which require a broad understanding, a soul endowed with wisdom and lengthy reflection whenafter one may find the right path therein, to ascertain the things which are forbidden and the things which are permitted, or to fathom the how and why of the other laws of the Torah.</p>
<p>Therefore, have I, Moses son of Maimon, of Spain, girded up my loins, and, supporting myself upon the Rock, blessed be He! made a comprehensive study of all those books and minded myself to construct out of all these compilations a clear summary on the subject of that which is forbidden or permitted, defiled or clean along with the other laws of the Torah, the whole scope in pure language and concise style, so that the Oral Torah be entirely methodical in the mouth of everybody, without query and without repartee, without the contentious thus of one and such of another, but clear text, cohesive, correct, in harmony with the law which is defined out of all these existing compilations and commentaries from the days of our Holy Master till now; so that all laws b open to young and old, whether they be laws concerning each and every commandment or whether they be laws concerning matters instituted by scholars and prophets. The main object of the matter being, that no man shall have a need of any other compilation in the world for any law of the laws of Israel, but this compilation shall be a cyclopedia of the whole Oral Torah together with a code of the statutes, customs and edicts which were enacted since the days of Moses our Master until the close of the Talmud, even as they were interpreted for us by the Gaonim in all their compilations which were compiled by them since the Talmudic era. Therefore, have I named this compilation Mishnah Torah; for, when one studies Holy Writ first and thereafter reads this Work, he obtains herefrom<sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> a complete knowledge of the Oral Torah, having no need to read any other book in between them. I have also minded myself to divide this work in treatises, each treatise comprising a given subject; the treatises were subdivided into chapters, and the chapters into small sections, so that it may serve as an index suitable to memorize it by heart. The range of the treatises of each and every subject varies; some embrace only the laws of a single commandment, as for example, a commandment around which much traditional matter was constructed, which is in reality a subject by itself; other treatises embrace the laws of many commandments, if they are commandments concerning one subject; because the division of this compilation is according to subjects, not according to the number of commandments; as it appears plainly to the reader. The number of the commandments of the Torah, which are established for all generations, is six hundred and thirteen, of which two hundred and forty eight are mandatory; a numerical comparison to the members in a human body, and three hundred and sixty-five prohibitive, a numerical comparison to the days of the solar year.</p>

Moreover, there are matters concerning which the Gaonim disagree, comes this author and selects the opinion of one in preference to another; why should I rely upon his choice, when the opinion does not please me, or when the contending authority is unknown to me, even whether or not he is competent to contend aught against another?

<li>That a ruler of Israel shall not have an unduly large quantity of silver or gold. Deut. 17.18.</li>
</ol>

<ftnote id="fn29"><sup>1</sup>&#x201C;This is not of the number, but is intended solely as an admonition not to swear by another god. Peradventure he did say so because a prohibitive derived from a mandatory is considered mandatory&#x201D;. The Maimonides attitude that it is mandatory to swear by His Name when an oath is imperative is justified seeing that it is a prohibitive commandment not to swear by His Name in vain. C.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn30"><sup>2</sup>&#x201C;But wherefore did he omit the commandment to build the altar of unhewn stone?&#x201D; Maimonides contends that the commandments to build a Temple includes every part thereof. C.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn31"><sup>3</sup>&#x201C;Wherefore did he omit the commandments about the incense-cups and the eating of show bread&#x201D;? Maimonides contends that the incense-cup or the eating thereof is not mandatory; only that when it is eaten, it must be eaten in the Sanctuary. C.</ftnote>
<title><small>BARD&#x2019;S CRITICISM</small></title>
<ftnote id="fn32"><sup>4</sup>&#x201C;No reason to include this; save for the peradventure that a prohibitive derived from a mandatory is mandatory&#x201D;. Maimonides placed it here for this very reason. C.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn33"><sup>5</sup>&#x201C;Why does he not count it as two commandments, the contamination and cleansing?&#x201D; Maimonides assumes that as both the contamination and purification comes about from the same water, it can be counted as one mandatory commandment only. C.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn34"><sup>6</sup>&#x201C;He has no reason for numbering this one among the commandments, unless it be that a prohibitive derived from a mandatory, is mandatory&#x201D;. When one desires to eat meat he must slaughter the animal, therefore, it is a mandatory commandment. C.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn35"><sup>7</sup>&#x201C;There is no reason for all such invetigations, save for the peradventure that a prohibitive derived from a mandatory is a mandatory.&#x201D; Maimonides considers it mandatory because it is derived from a prohibitive, as it is forbidden to eat these without investigation. C.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn36"><sup>8</sup>&#x201C;Such is not found in the text of the Sifre saying: &#x2018;To the idolater lend on usury, is a mandatory commandment&#x2019;; save because of the prohibitive derived from the mandatory, to an idolater but not to an Israelite&#x201D;. Maimonides maintains that the text clearly makes it mandatory, for if it only be permissive, no prohibitive could be derived therefrom, as it is needed to deduct that usury to an idolater is permitted. C.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn37"><sup>9</sup>&#x201C;Why should these not be counted as two or three commandments&#x201D;? No repartee was noted by Cairo on this query. The reason is obvious; Maimonides only enumerates the commandment ordering the judges to judge in cases of theft, without regard to the several kinds of theft for which divers punishments are ordered. G.</ftnote>
<title><small>BABD&#x2019;S CRITICISM</small></title>
<ftnote id="fn38"><sup>1</sup>&#x201C;Here are four prohibitive commandments more, the rounder, the roundee, the destroyer and the destroyee&#x201D;. Maimonides only enumerates the prohibitive commandments, and does not at all enter into guilt or innocence of the several parties to the act. C.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn39"><sup>2</sup>&#x201C;This is merely an expression of assurance, and not a prohibitive commandment&#x201D;. The text indicates the intention of a charge, not to fear the enemy; on the contrary, it is surprising that the <small>RABD</small>. should wander away from the common meaning of the text. C.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn40"><sup>3</sup>&#x201C;This is no commandment at all, seeing that one may change his pleading after judgment was rendered&#x201D;. The commandment is rightly placed as a fundamental difference in procedure between capital and other cases, and refers to the midst of a trial only. C.</ftnote>

<title>OVERVIEW OF MISHNEH TORAH CONTENTS</title>
<p>According to the Order of Treatises</p>
<p>B<small>Y OUR</small> M<small>ASTER</small> M<small>OSES</small> B<small>EN</small> M<small>AIMON</small> The Memory of the Pious be Blessed.</p>
<p>These are the six hundred and thirteen commandments which were transmitted orally to Moses on Sinai; they and their general, and their particular, and their precise exposition. All those general, particular and precise expositions of each and every commandment constitute the Oral Torah, which was received orally by one tribunal from another tribunal. There are, however, still other precepts, enacted after Revelation, and sustained by prophets and scholars, which spread throughout all Israel, for instance, such, as reading the book of Esther, Hanukah lights, fasting on the Ninth of Ab, carrying things and walking on the Sabbath (Erubin), and washing of the hands before meals, each and every one of these precepts having divers interpretations and suggestions, all of which will be elucidated in this compilation.</p>
<p>All of these newly-proclaimed precepts we are obliged to accept and observe, even as it is said. &#x201C;Thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall declare unto thee, to the right hand, not to the left&#x201D; (Deut. 17.11.), and they are not additions to the commandments of the Torah. If so, wherefore did the Torah charge us saying: &#x201C;Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it&#x201D; (Deut. 13.1.)? That refers to a prophet not to permit him to invent something and claim that the Holy One, blessed is He! ordered him to add a commandment to the commandments of the Torah, or to diminish one from these six hundred and thirteen commandments. But if a tribunal together with a prophet who flourished in a given period added a commandment in the form of a statute, or judicial decision, or edict, such is not an addition to the Torah. For, behold, they have not said that the Holy One, blessed is He! commanded to make an Erub, or read the Megilah on time; indeed, had they said so, they would have been adding to the commandments of the Torah; but what we do say is, The prophets together with the tribunal enacted it and commanded to read the Megilah on time, so as to remember the praiseworthiness of the Holy One, blessed is he! and the salvation which He brought about upon us by His nearness to us at the time of our supplication, so as to bless Him, and give thanks unto Him, and to proclaim to future generations the truth of what He assured us in the Torah, saying: &#x201C;For what great nation is there that hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is whensoever we call upon Him&#x201D; (Deut. 4.7.). In this way every precept, instituted by the words of the Sophrim, whether mandatory or prohibitive, came to pass.</p>
<p>And, I have looked into the matter and divided this compilation in fourteen books, as follows:</p>
<p>B<small>OOK</small> I. Comprises all the commandments which are the basic foundation of the Religion of Moses our Master, peace be upon him! and it is essential that man learn them before everything else, as, for example, concerning the Unity of God, blessed is He! and the prohibitive laws concerning idolatry. And, I have named this book: Book of Knowledge.</p>
<p>B<small>OOK</small> II. Comprises all the commandments which are in constant practice, as we were charged to observe them in order to express our love for God, and to remember Him continuously, for example, the reading of the She&#x2019;ma, prayers, phylacteries, priestly blessings, and mainly circumcision because it is a token upon our flesh, in order to be conscious of Him when we have no phylacteries, or fringes or the like on our bodies; and I have named this book: Book of Love.</p>
<p>B<small>OOK</small> III. Comprises all commandments which are observed during certain times, for example, Sabbaths and holidays; and I have named this book: Book of Times.</p>
<p>B<small>OOK</small> IV. Comprises all commandments concerning conjugal relationship, as for example, marriage, divorce, betrothal of sister-in-law, when a brother dies childless (Yibum), the performance of the rite Halizah by a sister-in-law when the brother-in-law refuses to marry her and build a name for his deceased brother, and I have named this book: Book of Women.</p>
<p>B<small>OOK</small> V. Comprises all the commandments concerning forbidden sexual relations, and the commandments concerning forbidden food; because in these two subjects we were sanctified by Almighty and separated by Him from the idolaters, and of both it is said; &#x201C;And have set you apart from the peoples&#x201D; (Lev. 20.26.); and, &#x201C;Who have set you apart from the peoples&#x201D;. (Ibid. &#x2013;24.); and I have named this book: Book of Holiness.</p>
<p>B<small>OOK</small> VI. Comprises the commandments concerning the obligations one acquires by spoken words, for example, oaths and vows; and I have named this book: Book of Separation,</p>
<p>B<small>OOK</small> VII. Comprises the commandments concerning agriculture, for example, Sabbatical and Jubilee years, tithes, heave-offerings and other laws mainly connected therewith or of a kindred subject; and I have named this book: Book of Seeds.</p>
<p>B<small>OOK</small> VIII. Comprises the commandments concerning the building of the Temple and the regular public offerings; and I have named this book; Book of Service.</p>
<p>B<small>OOK</small> IX. Comprises the commandments concerning private sacrifices; and I have named this book: Book of Sacrifices.</p>
<p>B<small>OOK</small> X. Comprises the commandments concerning purification and contamination; and I have named this book; Book of Purification.</p>
<p>B<small>OOK</small> XI. Comprises the commandments concerning man and man, where there is either pecuniary or bodily damage on the face of the dispute; and I have named this book: Book of Torts.</p>
<p>B<small>OOK</small> XII. Comprises the commandments concerning selling and buying; and I have named this book: Book of Bargaining.</p>
<p>B<small>OOK</small> XIII. Comprises the commandments concerning disputes between man and man in civil laws, where there appears no damage on the face of the dispute, as for example, trustees, debtors, contentions and denials; and I have named this book: Book of Civil Law.</p>
<p>B<small>OOK</small> XIV. Comprises the commandments which the Sanhedrin are to enforce, such as the death penalty, evidence, naming of a king, and his making of wars; and I have named this book: Book of Judicial Procedure.</p>
<p>And now I shall, with the help of God Almighty, begin to summarize all laws derived from each and every commandment, and all the regulations each embraces in its respective subject, according to the order of the treatises.</p>

<chapter>
<title>THE TREATISE CONCERNING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE TORAH</title>
<h1><p>CHAPTER I.</p></h1>
<p>1. The foundation of foundations and firmest pillar of all wisdom is, To know that there is a First Being, that He caused all beings to be, and that all beings from heaven and earth, and from between them, could not be save for the truth of His Own Being.</p>
<p>2. Thus, supposing that He is not, none else could have been called into existence.</p>
<p>3. Conversely, supposing all other beings, save He alone, non-existent, His Being alone remains; for, He does not cease to be because of their non-existence, as all beings are dependent upon Him, but He, blessed is He! is not dependent upon them nor upon a single one of them; therefore, the truth of His Being is incomparable to the truth of any other individual being.</p>
<p>4. This is as the prophet says: &#x201C;But the Lord God is the true God&#x201D; (Jer. 10.10); He alone is the Truth, and no other being possesses a truth similar to His Truth, even as the Torah says: &#x201C;There is none other like unto Him&#x201D; (Deut. 4.39), meaning, there is no other true being, besides Him, like unto Him.</p>
<p>5. This Being is the God of the universe, Lord of the whole earth, who guides the sphere with an infinite force, a force of perpetual motion; for the sphere revolves continuously, which would be impossible without some one causing it to revolve; and it is He, blessed is He! Who causes it to revolve without hand and without body.</p>
<p>6. To know this matter is a mandatory commandment, saying: &#x201C;I am the Lord thy God&#x201D; (Ex. 20,2); therefore, whosoever supposes that there is another god besides This One, (1) violates a prohibitive commandment, saying: &#x201C;Thou shalt have no other gods before me&#x201D; (Ibid. &#x2013;3), and is an atheist, denying the great principle upon which everything depends.</p>
<p>7. This God is One God; He is neither two nor more than two but One to whose Unity there is no comparison among the individual units in the universe; not like the unit of a genus which embraces many individual units, nor like the unit of a body which is divisible into parts and particles, but a Unit to Whose Unity no other unit in the universe is like. Supposing that there are many deities is equivalent to an admission that they are corporeal, because like individual beings do not differ save in chance traits characteristic of bodies and material things only. Thus supposing the Creator to be corporeal and material would force a conclusion that He is finite, for, it is impossible to imagine a body which does not end in dissolution; but our God, blessed is His Name! beholding that His power is infinite and uninterrupted, for lo, the universal sphere continuous to revolve forever. His power is positively not a physical power. And, because He is Incorporeal, none of the chance traits, characteristic of bodies, so as to be divisible or an offshoot of another being, can be attributed to Him. Therefore, the impossibility for Him to be but One. And, the knowledge of this doctrine of Monotheism is a mandatory commandment, saying: &#x201C;The Lord our God is One God&#x201D; (Deut. 6.4).</p>
<p>8. Behold, it is clearly indicated in the Torah and in the Prophets that the Holy One, blessed is He! is Incorporeal for it is said: &#x201C;That the Lord, He is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath&#x201D; (Deut. 4.39); a corporeal being is incapable of being in two places simultaneously; and it is also said: &#x201C;For ye saw no manner of form&#x201D; (Ibid.&#x2013;15); and it is moreover said: &#x201C;To whom will ye liken me, that I should be equal?&#x201D; (Isa. 40,25); had He been corporeal He would be like other bodies.</p>
<p>9. If so, wherefore is it written in the Torah, &#x201C;And there was under his feet&#x201D; (Ex. 24,10), &#x201C;Written with the finger of God&#x201D; (Ibid. 31,18), &#x201C;The hand of the Lord&#x201D; (Ibid. 9,3), &#x201C;The eyes of the Lord&#x201D; (Deut. 11, 12), &#x201C;The ears of the Lord&#x201D; (Num. 11,18) and more like expressions? All such terminology is in accordance with the conception of sons of man who cannot recognize aught but corporeal things, and the words of the Torah is like human speech, but they are all attributes; for example, it is said: &#x201C;If I whet My glittering sword,&#x201D; (Deut. 32. 41.); Hath He a sword, or doth He slay with a sword? But it is a metaphor, so is all metaphorical. As testimony thereto, one prophet says that he saw the Holy One, blessed is He! &#x201C;His raiment was as white snow&#x201D; (Dan. 7,9), and another saw Him &#x201C;With crimsoned garments from Bozrah&#x201D; (Isa. 63,1); Moses our Master himself saw Him at the Red Sea &#x201C;as a hero engaged in battle,&#x201D; (Ex. 15.3) and upon Sinai as &#x201C;a garbed minister of a congregation (Ibid. 19.19.), to say: He hath neither form nor image, but all is a vision of prophecy and a mirage, the absolute truth of the matter no human mind comprehends or is able to fathom it or penetrate it. It is even this what it says in Scripture: &#x201C;Canst thou find out the deep things of God? Canst thou attain unto the purposes of the Almighty?&#x201D; (Job. 11,7).</p>
<p>10. What was it then that Moses our Master sought to attain when he said: &#x201C;Show me, I pray Thee, Thy glory&#x201D; (Ex. 33,18)? He desired to know the truth of the existence of the Holy One, blessed is He! with a thorough knowledge within his heart, even as he would know a certain person whose countenance he saw and whose likeness was imprinted upon his heart, so that he could find him in his mind&#x2019;s vision separated from other persons; even so did Moses our Master seek to establish the existence of the Holy One, blessed is He! separated within his heart from other beings, until he would know the truth of His existence as it is. And He, blessed is He! answered him, that it is not within the intellectual power of the living man, who is a composite being of body and soul, to reach the pure truth of this matter; but He, blessed is He! imparted to him that which no man before him did nor no man after him shall know for, he fathomed the subject of the true existence of the Holy One, blessed is He! even so that He became separated in his mind&#x2019;s vision from other beings; as, for instance, he could separate in his mind a certain person, whose back and body and clothes he saw from bodies of other persons. And, concerning this matter the Passage points, saying: &#x201C;And thou shalt see My back; but My face shall not be seen&#x201D; (Ex. 33,23).</p>
<p>11. Since it is clear that He is Incorporeal, it clearly follows that none of the corporeal changes happen to Him; no joining and no separation, no place and no measure, no ascent and no descent, no right and no left, no face and no back, no sitting and no standing; neither is His being dependent on time to attribute to Him either a beginning, or an end, or number of years; nor is He undergoing any change as there is naught to cause any change in Him; He is neither subject to death nor to life similar to the life of a living body; to Him cannot be attributed either folly or wisdom similar to the wisdom of a wise man; no sleep and no awakening, no anger and no laughter, no joy and no sadness, no silence and no speech similar to human speech; and likewise have the sages declared: &#x201C;Above there is neither sitting down nor standing up, no backward nor forward&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn41">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. Now, since the matter is so, all such and other similar expressions in the Torah and in the words of the Prophets are merely proverbial and figurative; for example, it is said: &#x201C;He that sitteth in heaven laugheth&#x201D; (Ps. 2,4), &#x201C;They have provoked Me with their vanities&#x201D; (Deut. 32,21), &#x201C;As the Lord rejoiced&#x201D; (Ibid. 28, 63), and like verses. Concerning all these the wise men said<sup><xref rid="fn42">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;The words of the Torah is like human speech&#x201D;. It is, moreover said: &#x201C;Do they provoke Me&#x201D; (Jer.7,19), whereas it has been said: &#x201C;For I the Lord change not&#x201D; (Mal. 3,6 6); if He could sometimes be angry and sometimes mirthful, He would be subject to changes. Indeed, such and all kindred attributes are not present in any save in darkened, lowly bodies, inhabitants of houses of clay, whose origin is of dust; but He, blessed is He! in blessings is exalted above all this.</p>
<h1><p>CHAPTER II.</p></h1>
<p>1. It is mandatory to love and fear this Glorified and Awe-inspiring God, for it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God&#x201D; (Deut. 6,5); and as it is said: &#x201C;The Lord thy God thou shalt fear.&#x201D; (Ibid. 6, 13).</p>
<p>2. But how may one discover the way to love and fear Him? When man will reflect concerning His works, and His great and wonderful creatures,<sup><xref rid="fn43">1</xref></sup> and will behold through them His wonderful, matchless and infinite wisdom, he will spontaneously be filled with love, praise and exaltation and become possessed of a great longing to know the Great Name, even as David said: &#x201C;My soul thirsts for God, for the living God,&#x201D; (Ps. 42,2); and when he will think of all these matters,<sup><xref rid="fn44">2</xref></sup> he will be taken aback in a moment and stricken with awe, and realize that he is an infinitesimal creature, humble and dark, standing with an insignificant and slight knowledge in the presence of the All Wise, as David said: &#x201C;For when I see Thy heavens, the wonderful works of Thy fingers, of what use is man that Thou mayest remember him?&#x201D; (Ibid. 8,4). And, in harmony with these matters, I elucidate great, general principles of the works of the Lord of the universe, so that they might serve as an opening for one who understands by which to love the Name, as some sages said on the subject of love: &#x201C;Out of it thou wilt recognize the One who spoke, and the universe was called into existence.&#x201D;</p>
<p>3. All that which the Holy One, blessed is He! created in His world, is divided into three types: (a) Composite creatures of matter and form; they are beings which undergo constant changes, as the bodies of man, beasts, plants and minerals; (b) Composite beings of matter and form which do not undergo changes of either body or form as the former, but their forms remain forever set in their body unchanged; they are: the planets and the stars around them; their matter is unlike other matter and their forms are unlike other forms; (c) Beings possessed of forms but of no matter whatever; they are the angels; for the angels are incorporeal but varied forms.</p>
<p>4. And, what is this that the prophets say that they saw the angel as of fire and winged? This all is in prophetic vision and enigmatical, emphasizing that the being is incorporeal and has no gravity as other massive bodies, as, for instance it is said: &#x201C;For the Lord your God is a burning flame,&#x201D; (Deut. 4,24). Who is not of fire but it is merely a figure of speech; and, for further instance, it is said: &#x201C;He maketh His angels of winds.&#x201D; (Ps. 104, 4).</p>
<p>5. Not being corporeal, in what do these forms vary one from the other? In that that they are not alike in their being, but each one of them functions in a lesser degree than the other, and each one derives his being from the power of the one above him; but all of them derive their being from the Power and Goodness of the Holy One, Blessed is He! and from His munificence, which is as Solomon in his wisdom pointed at and said: &#x201C;For One higher than the high watcheth.&#x201D; (Ecc. 5,7).</p>
<p>6. What we said &#x201C;in a lesser degree than the other,&#x201D; does not mean a degree in place, as one man sits a degree higher than the other, but as it is said of two scholars that one is greater than the other in learning, who is of a degree higher than the other, and, as we speak of the cause as of a higher degree than the thing to which it gives being.</p>
<p>7. The variation in the names of the angels is based upon their degrees; they are therefore called: Holy Living Creatures, which are above all others, Wheels, Valiant Ones, Electrum, Flying Serpent, Angels, Gods, Sons of Gods, Chariot Bearers, and Men. All these ten names by which the angels are called designate their respective ten degrees; the degree which has nothing higher than itself, save only the degree of God, blessed is He! is the degree of the form which is called Living Creatures; thus it is spoken of in prophecy as being beneath the Throne of Glory. And the tenth degree is the degree of the form known as Men, which are the angels who speak with the prophets and appear to them in the vision of prophecy. Therefore they are called Men, as their degree approaches the the degree of the intellect of the sons of man.<sup><xref rid="fn45">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. All of these Forms are alive and recognize the Creator, and know Him with an extreme power of intelligence, each Form according to its degree, not according to its size. But even the Form of the first degree cannot attain the truth of the Creator as He is, for, its intelligence falls short of such attainment and knowledge; nevertheless, it attains and knows more than the Form beneath itself knows and attains. Likewise are they all, from each and every degree, even till the tenth degree, which Form also knows the Creator with an understanding which is not within the power of the sons of man, who are composite beings of matter and form, to attain and know. And, all of them do not know the Creator as He Himself knows His Own Being.</p>
<p>9. All beings, save only the Creator, from the First Form to the smallest moth which might be in the center of the earth, came into being by the power of His truth; and because He knows His Own Being, and recognizes His Own greatness, Glory and Truth, He is All-Knowing, and there is not a matter concealed from Him.</p>
<p>10. The Holy One, blessed is He! recognizes His Own Truth and knows it as it really is; and He does not know with an intelligence which is apart from Himself, as we know, for, we and our intelligence are not one, but the Creator, may He be blessed! and His Intelligence and His Life are One from every lateral, angle and manner of Unity. Since but for this, He would live a life and understand with an intelligence apart from Himself, then there would be many gods, He, His life and His Intelligence; and it is not so, for He is One from every lateral, angle and manner of Unity. Consequently you must say that, what He knows, and that by which He is known, and the Intelligence itself are all One. But this matter the mouth has no power to express, nor the ear to perceive, neither is it within the heart of man to see it clearly. Therefore, it is spoken of, &#x201C;the life of Pharoh&#x201D; (Gen. 42,5) and &#x201C;the life of thy soul&#x201D; (Sam. 1.26), and it is not spoken of &#x201C;the life of God,&#x201D; but &#x201C;the living God,&#x201D; (Judg. 8.19) because the Creator and His life are not two, as are the lives of living bodies, or as the lives of angels. Wherefore, He does not recognize the creatures nor knows them because they are creatures as we know them, but by reason of knowing His Own Self does He know them. Therefore, because He knows His Own Self, He knows all; for, all depend upon Him in being.</p>
<p>11. These matters we spoke of on this subject in these two chapters, are but a drop in the ocean of what it ought to be expounded in this subject; and the exposition of all the principles in these two chapters, are known as the Works of the Chariot. (Ezek. 1).</p>
<p>12. The ancient sages have commanded not to sermonize concerning these matters;<sup><xref rid="fn46">4</xref></sup> save only to one man at a time, if he be wise, possessed of an intelligence of his own, whenafter to him might be transmitted the headlines of the chapters and acquaint him with a fraction of the matter so that he be able to understand its conclusion by his own intelligence and fathom its depth. These matters are extremely deep matters indeed, and not each and every intelligence is prepared to suffer them. And concerning them Solomon in his wisdom metaphorically said: &#x201C;The lambs will be for thy clothing&#x201D; (Prov. 27,26); so have the sages interpreted this metaphor: &#x201C;matters which are covering the universe shall be for thy garment,&#x201D; meaning they are a garment for thee alone, but thou shalt not sermonize them before the multitude. And, concerning them he further said: &#x201C;Let it be for thee alone and for no strangers with thee,&#x201D; (Ibid. 5,17). And concerning them he, moreover, said: &#x201C;Milk and honey shall be beneath thy tongue;&#x201D; (Song of Songs, 4,11); so have the early sages interpreted it: &#x201C;Matters which are likened to honey and milk shall remain beneath thine own tongue&#x201D;.</p>
<h1><p>CHAPTER III.</p></h1>
<p>1. The celestial spheres are called heaven,<sup><xref rid="fn47">1</xref></sup> firmament, habitation and nebula, and there are nine such spheres; the sphere nearest to us is the Moon; the second above it is the sphere wherein is set the star Mercury; in the third sphere above it is Venus; in the fourth sphere is the Sun; in the fifth sphere is Mars; in the sixth sphere is the star Jupiter; in the seventh is Saturn; in the eighth sphere are set all the stars which are seen in the firmament; the ninth sphere is the sphere which traverses daily from east to west, and encompasses and encircles all. And, what you see all stars as if they all are in one sphere, although they are set one above the other, is because the spheres are pure and transparent as glass or sapphire, therefore the stars which are in the eighth sphere, seem to be beneath the first sphere.</p>
<p>2. Each and every one of the eight spheres wherein are the stars is divided into many spheres one above the other, in the manner of onion-peelings. Some are spheres, revolving from west to east, and others are revolving from east to west, as is the ninth sphere, which traverses from east to west; but among them all there is no blank space.</p>
<p>3. All the spheres are neither light nor heavy; they have not the color of red, and not the color of black, and not any other colors; and what we see them in the color of blue is only an optical illusion according to the height of the horizon. Likewise have they no flavor and no odor, as these characteristics are not found save only in bodies beneath them.</p>
<p>4. All of these spheres which encircle the universe, are round as a globe, and the earth is suspended in the center. Some few of the stars have small spheres which are set stationary within them, and such spheres do not encircle the earth, for the small, fixed sphere which does not encircle, is set in the large sphere which does encircle.</p>
<p>5. The number of all the spheres which encircle the universe is eighteen; and the number of the lesser spheres which do not encircle the universe is eight; and from the travel of the stars and the knowledge of the distance covered by their cycle each day and each hour, and from their deviation from south to north and from north to south, and from their distance from and nearness to the earth, the number of these spheres, the form of their travels and the way they circle is known. This is the science of cycles and constellations concerning which the Greek scholars wrote many books.</p>
<p>6. The ninth sphere which encircles them all, the ancient scholars divided into twelve segments, for each and every segment they invented a name after the name of this image you see in it as a reflection of the stars beneath it, which are set immediately under it. They are the Zodiac: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces.</p>
<p>7. The ninth sphere itself is not segmental and not of a form resembling any forms of these, and not a star. But, in conjunction with the stars of the eighth sphere, is that which can be seen in the large stars wherein appear the likeness of these forms, or the resemblance thereof. These twelve forms were not set directly opposite those segments save only during the ante-diluvian period, when these names were invented for them; but in these times they have long ago reclined a little, because all the stars in the eighth sphere revolve similar to that of the sun and the moon, only they revolve heavily; and the distance covered by the sun and the moon in one day, it will take each star of them to cover almost seventy years.</p>
<p>8. Among all the visible stars there are some small stars than one of which the earth is bigger, and some large stars each of which is bigger than the earth manifold. The earth is bigger than the moon about forty times, and the sun is bigger than the earth one hundred and seventy times; consequently, the moon is approximately 1-6800 part of the sun. Among the stars there is no star bigger than the sun and none smaller than the star in the second sphere.</p>
<p>9. All of the stars and spheres are beings, endowed with a soul, intelligence and understanding; they continue a purposeful life and are conscious of the existence of Him Who spoke and the universe sprang forth. Each and every one, according to his greatness and degree, extol and glorify the Creator as do the angels; and to the extent that they recognize the Holy One, blessed is He! they also know their own selves and the angels above them. But the intelligence of the stars and spheres is lesser than the intelligence of the angels, but greater than the intelligence of man.</p>
<p>10. Beneath the sphere of the moon, God created a certain body which is not like the body of the spheres, and He created four forms for this body which are unlike the forms of the spheres; and each and every form was set in part of this body. The first form is the form of fire, which was coupled with part of this body and their issue is the body of fire; the second form is the form of air which was coupled with part of this body and their issue is the body of air; the third form is the form of water, which was coupled with part of this body and their issue is the body of water; the fourth form is the form of the earth, which was coupled with part of this matter, and their issue is the body of the earth. Consequently, beneath the expanse there are four dissimilar bodies, one above the other, and each of these encircles the one immediately beneath it on all sides, sphere-like. The first body nearest the sphere of the moon is the body of fire; beneath it the body of air; beneath it the body of water; beneath it the body of the earth, and in between there is no blank space whatever without a body.<sup><xref rid="fn48">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. These four bodies are not endowed with a soul, they do not know and do not recognize but are dead bodies. And each and every one of them has a law which it knows not, and which it can not attain, and which it can not change. Of this David said: &#x201C;Praise the Lord from the earth, ye sea-monsters, and all deep, fire and hail, snow and vapor&#x201D; (Ps. 148. 7&#x2013;8). The explanation of the subject of these words is: &#x201C;Sons of men, praise Him in His mightiness which ye behold in flame and in hail, and in other creatures which ye see beneath the expanse, for their power is perpetually manifest to small and big&#x201D;.</p>
<h1><p>CHAPTER IV</p></h1>
<p>1. These four elements, namely: fire, air, water and earth, are the elements of all the creatures beneath the expanse; all that be whether of man, beast, fowl, creeping thing, fish, vegetation, minerals, precious stones, pearls, structural stones, mountains and glaciers, the body of each and every one is the joint issue of these four elements. Consequently all bodies beneath the expanse, save only these four elements, are joint issue of matter and form; and the body of each is the joint issue of these four elements; but each of these four elements is not the composite of aught else save of body and form only.</p>
<p>2. It is the nature of fire and air to go upwards, from the center of the earth upwards towards the expanse; and it is the nature of water and earth to direct their movements beneath the expanse toward its center, as the center of the expanse is the lowermost point, than which there is nothing lower. Their course is not due to their intelligence and not to their desire, but to a rule fixed in them, and to nature which was engendered in them. By nature fire is warm and dry and, therefore, lighter than all of them; and the air is warm and moist; and water is cool and moist; and the earth is dry and cool, and it is heavier than all of them; water is lighter than it, therefore is its place above the earth; the air is lighter than water; therefore is its place above the water; and fire is lighter than air. And because they are elements for all bodies beneath the expanse, it is found that each and every body, whether of man, beasts, animal, fowl and fish, or whether of plant, mineral and stone, its unformed matter is a fusion of fire, air, water and earth. The four elements, too, fuse together so that each one of them loses identity when such fusion takes place, so that the fused element of the four of them becomes unlike one of them when it is by itself. And, in such fused body there is not even one particle which is actual fire, or actual water, or actual earth, or actual air, for all were transformed and made into one body. And in each and every such fused body of the four there is coolness, heat, moisture and drought combined. Nevertheless, there are among them certain bodies in which the element of fire is strongest, as in living creatures, therefore the element of heat is more apparent in them; and there are among them bodies wherein the element of earth is strongest, as in stones, therefore the element of drought is most prominent in them; and there are among them bodies wherein the element of water is strongest, therefore the element of moisture is more apparent. In this manner it happens that one warm body is warmer than another warm body, and one dry body more dry than another dry body. So are found bodies wherein the cold alone appears, and bodies wherein the moisture alone appears, and bodies wherein the cold and the drought appear evenly balanced, or the cold and the moisture evenly balanced, or the heat and the drought evenly balanced, or the heat and the moisture evenly balanced, according to the size of the quantity which was the fundamental element for the fusion will the action of that element and its nature appear in the fused body.</p>
<p>3. All things fused of the four elements terminate in dissolution. In some instances, the dissolution will be in but few days; in others, such dissolution will come to pass after many years; but all that which was fused by them can not avoid dissolution back into them. Even gold and platinum cannot avoid termination and a return to the elements. The process of such return is, part to fire, part to water, part to air and part to dust.</p>
<p>4. Since all that must terminate dissolve into these elements, wherefore was it said to Adam: &#x201C;And into dust shalt thou return&#x201D; (Gen. 3.19)? Because the greatest part of his structure is dust. And, not all that undergo dissolution, when they dissolve return at once to the four elements; for they dissolve gradually, one thing will be turned into another, that other into still another one, and in the end those things return to the elements, and thus it is discovered that all things turn in a circle.</p>
<p>5. The four elements perpetually change one into another, partially, and not bodily. How so? Part of the earth nearest the water breaks and changes and becomes water; so does part of the water nearest the air evaporate and change and become air; so does part of the air nearest fire shift and change and become fire; so does part of fire nearest air shift and change, solidify and become air; so does part of the air nearest the water change, solidify and become water; so does part of the water nearest earth change, clots and becomes earth. But the change is little by little, in proportion to the lapse of time. Neither does an element change completely so that all the water will become air, or all the air fire, because it is impossible that one of these four elements should be entirely nullified; but part of the fire does become air, part of the air does become fire, and so between each and the other, and thus the change will be found among the four, and so it turns in a circle forever.</p>
<p>6. This change is made possible by the revolution of the sphere, and by the force of its revolution the four elements derive power of fusion, and out of them are other bodies, sons of man, living creature, plant, stone and mineral. To each and every body God gives a due form through the Angel of the tenth sphere, the Intelligence called Men.</p>
<p>7. You never see a body without a form, or a form without a body; it is only the heart of man which divides a given body conceived in his mind and knows that it is fused of matter and form; he also knows that there are bodies whose unformed matter is fused of the four elements and bodies whose unformed matter is plain, unfused and of but one element. The forms which are not of matter are not visible to the eye, but are known to the heart&#x2019;s eye as we know the Lord of all without seeing Him with the eye.</p>
<p>8. The soul of all flesh is the form which God gave unto him, and the high intelligence which is found in the soul of man is the form of the man who is perfectly intelligent. Concerning this form it is said in the Torah: &#x201C;Let us make man in our form after our image&#x201D; (Gen. 1.26), as if saying, that he should possess a form which knows and attains the Intelligences which have no body, as angels, which are forms without a body, thereby being like unto them. But this is not spoken of a given form which is recognized by the eyes, as the mouth, the nose, the cheek-bones, or any other description of the body, for such is the name of its shape; neither does it apply to the life of living creatures by which it can eat, drink, reproduce, feel and ponder; but it is concerning the Intelligence which is the form of the soul, for it is about the form of the soul that the Verse speaks&#x2014;&#x201C;in our form after our image&#x201D;. Often times this form is called soul and breath of life, and, therefore, it is necessary to take care in naming them, so that man will not err in such, but each and every name one will learn from the subject thereof.</p>
<p>9. The form of this soul is not composed of the elements to be separated and become part of them, and it is not an offshoot of the power of the soul to be dependent upon a soul as well as the soul is dependent upon a body. But this form is from the Lord, from Heaven. Therefore, when the body which is composed of the four elements dissolves and the spirit of life is lost, because it is non-existing save only when in the body, and is dependent upon a body in all its functions, this form will not be cut off, for it is not dependent upon a soul in its functions, but doth know and attain all Intelligences which are independent of matter, and knows the Creator of all, and lives forever and throughout all worlds to be. This is what Solomon in his wisdom said: &#x201C;And the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit unto God Who gave it.&#x201D; (Ecc. 12.7).</p>
<p>10. All these matters we spoke of on this subject are but a drop in the bucket, and they are very deep matters; but are not of the same depth as the subject in chapters I and II. The exposition of all these matters in chapters III and IV is called Cosmogony. Thus did the ancient sages charge not to sermonize on these matters before the multitude, but to impart them to one man and instruct him therein.<sup><xref rid="fn49">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. And, wherein is the difference between the subject of Works of the Chariot and the subject of Cosmogony? The subject of Works of the Chariot shall not be imparted even to an individual unless he be a scholar endowed with a reasoning power of his own, and then only the epitomes of each chapter may be transmitted to him; whereas the subject of Cosmogony may be imparted to an individual, even though not endowed with a reasoning power of his own, and it is permissible to teach him all that he is capable of knowing concerning these matters. If so, why not give public instructions therein? Because not every man is endowed with broad understanding to construe the explanation and elucidation of all the text correctly.</p>
<p>12. When man contemplates concerning these things, and perceives all creatures, whether angel, sphere, or man the likeness of himself, and discovers the wisdom of the Holy One, blessed is He! in all beings of form and in all creatures, his love for the Omnipresent increases and his soul and body thirst and yearn to love Him, blessed is He! and, fear and terror, because of his own insignificance, shortcomings and levity seize him when comparing himself to one of the great and holy bodies, verily so to one of the pure forms, separated from bodies of clay, which never joined a body of clay. He then will find himself likened to a vessel full of shame and disgrace, empty and wanting.<sup><xref rid="fn50">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. The subjects in these four chapters of these five commandments, are the same which the early sages speak of as Vineyard, saying: &#x201C;Four entered the vineyard&#x201D; (Haggigah 14), who, though great men in Israel and great scholars, not all of them had the intellectual power to know and grasp all these matters clearly; and I say that no one is deserving to promenade in the Vineyard unless he be filled with intellectual bread and meat, that is to say: one must know what is forbidden and what is permitted and similar to these of the rest of the commandments. And, although these matters were pronounced by the sages as of lesser importance, for they said: &#x201C;A great matter is the Works of the Chariot, and a small matter is the controversies of Abyia and Raba,<sup><xref rid="fn51">3</xref></sup> Nevertheless, they have precedence as a study because they commence to compose man&#x2019;s mind; moreover, they are the store of great good which the Holy One, blessed is He, hath provided for the social existence of this world, so that the life of the world to Come may also be inherited, and be accessible to all, little and great, men and women, to one of broad understanding as well as to one of lesser understanding.</p>
<h1><p>CHAPTER V.</p></h1>
<p>1. It is mandatory upon the whole house of Israel to sanctify this Great Name, for it is said: &#x201C;And I shall be sanctified among the children of Israel&#x201D; (Lev. 22.32). They are also charged not to blaspheme Him, for it is said: &#x201C;And ye shall not profane My holy Name&#x201D; (Ibid.). How are these commandments to be observed? If an idolater will force an Israelite to transgress one of the commandments of the Torah and threaten him with death for disobedience, it is mandatory that he transgress the commandment and be not put to death, for it is said concerning the commandments: &#x201C;That which a man may do and live by it&#x201D; (Ibid. 18.5)&#x2014;&#x201C;live by it, but not die for it&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn52">1</xref></sup>Thus, if he chose death and did not transgress, his blood be upon his own head.</p>
<p>2. Whereat are these words directed? Concerning all other commandments, save idolatry, adultery and blood-shed. For respecting these three commandments, if one will say to him: &#x201C;Transgress one of the three, or die,&#x201D; he shall die, and not transgress. Whereat are these words directed? When the idolater intends to have a personal enjoyment, as when he forces an Israelite to build his house, or cook his meals on a Sabbath, or when he forces a Jewish woman, and in like matters; but if he merely intended to make him violate commandments, then, if it happen between themselves, and there be no ten Israelites present, it is mandatory to transgress and not die; but if he forces him to go astray from one of the commandments in the presence of ten Israelites, he must suffer death and not transgress, even though the idolater did not intend to lead him astray save from one of the rest of the commandments.</p>
<p>3. And all these words are directed at a time which is not under pressure of arbitrary edicts, but at a time of arbitrary edicts such as when a wicked king, like Nebuchadnezzar and his associates arise and issue an edict against Israel to violate their religion, or one of the commandments, then he should die and not transgress even one of the other commandments, whether he is forced to do the transgression in the presence of ten, or whether the compulsion will be between himself and the idolater.</p>
<p>4. Whosoever, of whom it is said that he shall transgress and not die, if he die and did not transgress, the guilt thereof be upon his soul;<sup><xref rid="fn53">2</xref></sup> and whosoever, concerning whom it is said that he shall die and not transgress, and he did die and did not transgress, he sanctified the Name of God; and if this happened in the presence of ten Israelites, he sanctified the Name of God among many, even like unto Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah and Rabbi Akiba and his associates, who have been slain by decree of a tyrannical government to which degree of martyrdom there is no parallel, concerning whom it is said: &#x201C;But for Thy sake we are killed all the day; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter&#x201D; (Ps. 44.23); and concerning whom it is moreover said: &#x201C;Gather my saints together unto me, those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice&#x201D; (Ibid. 50.5). And whosoever, concerning whom it is said that he shall die and not transgress, did transgress and did not die, blasphemed the Name of God, and if he did this in the presence of ten Israelites, he blasphemed the Name of God in the presence of many, violated the mandatory commandment of the sanctification of God, and transgressed the prohibitive commandment of blasphemy. Nevertheless, because he committed the transgression in duress, he is not lashed, needless to say that no punishment of death is inflicted upon him by a tribunal, even though he commit murder in duress; for no punishment of either lashes or death is inflicted unless one commits the crime willfully in the presence of witnesses, and received a warning not to do it, even as it is said of one who sacrifices his children to Mollech: &#x201C;And I will set my face against that man&#x201D; (Lev. 20.3), which is traditionally understood to mean that that man was not under duress, nor in error, nor in ignorance. Now, if idolatry, which is the capital offense of them all, yet whosoever worships it in duress, is not guilty to be cut off from among his people, not to say of being put to death by a tribunal, a minori ad majus that an offense against the other commandments enumerated in the Torah should remain as the major premise. Furthermore, concerning adultery it is said: &#x201C;But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing&#x201D; (Deut. 22. 26).<sup><xref rid="fn54">3</xref></sup> But if he can save his life and flee from the jurisdiction of such a wicked king, and he does it not, he is likened unto a dog that returneth to his vomit, and is called a willful worshipper of idolatry, and is deprived of the world to come, for he will descend into the nethermost level of the Gehenna.</p>
<p>5. If idolaters will demand one of a group of women, saying: &#x201C;Yield us one of among you and we will defile her, if not we will defile you all&#x201D;, let all be defiled, rather than surrender to them one soul in Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn55">4</xref></sup> Likewise, if idolaters will say to a group of men: &#x201C;Yield us one of you and we will kill him, if not we will kill you all&#x201D;, let all of them be killed rather than surrender to them one soul in Israel. If, however, they single out the one, saying: &#x201C;Give us that man, if not we will kill you all&#x201D;, if he be guilty of a capital crime, as, for example, Sheba son of Bichri<sup><xref rid="fn56">5</xref></sup>, they may surrender him to them, but it is not commendable to advise them to do so; if he be not guilty of a capital crime, they all must submit rather than surrender them one soul in Israel.</p>
<p>6. As they said on the subject of duress, so they said of sickness. How so? For example: One who takes sick and his life is despaired of, and doctors prescribe a remedy for him consisting of a certain thing which is forbidden, the doctor&#x2019;s orders are followed. Healing is effected by everything that the Torah forbids, where there is danger of death<sup><xref rid="fn57">6</xref></sup>, save only idolatry, adultery and murder, which even in case of danger, must not be employed as means of healing. If he transgress and be cured by such means, the tribunal may visit upon him due punishment.</p>
<p>7. Whence do we know that even when life is in danger, none of these prohibitive commandments may be violated? From what it is said: &#x201C;And thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might&#x201D; (Deut. 6.5), even though He taketh thy life.<sup><xref rid="fn58">7</xref></sup> And, the taking of one life in Israel to give healing to another life, or to save a man from an assassin is a thing which reason dictates not to do, for one life must not be sacrificed for another life. As for adultery, it is likened unto life itself, as it is said: &#x201C;For as when a man riseth against his neighbor and slayeth him, even so is this matter&#x201D; (Ibid. 22.26).</p>
<p>8. Whereat are these words against using other forbidden things as remedies, save where there is danger of life, directed? When given in a manner to enjoy it, as for example, feeding a sick person oysters or frogs, or leavened bread on Passover, or any food on the Day of Atonement; but when administered not in a manner to enjoy it, as, for example, to apply a plaster or poultice of leaven on Passover, or of uncircumcized fruit,<sup><xref rid="fn59">8</xref></sup> or a drink containing a mixture of forbidden ingredients of food, which is not at all palatable, is permissible, even when there is no danger, save only of grafted fruit from a vineyard, and milk together with meat, which are forbidden even when not enjoying them. Therefore, healing therewith is forbidden even in a manner not to enjoy it, unless there is danger of death.</p>
<p>9. One who coveted a certain woman and became dangerously sick so that his life was despaired of, and the doctors declared that for him there was no remedy save that she be with him, he shall die even though she be not wedded and even though the remedy be for him to talk to her from behind a screen, no permission shall be given to him; let him die<sup><xref rid="fn60">9</xref></sup> but no permission be given him to talk to her from behind a screen, so that the daughters in Israel shall not be without protection, and thereby become accustomed to consider unchastity lightly.</p>
<p>10. Whosoever willfully, without duress, will transgress one of the commandments of the Torah, because he despises it and does so spitefully, behold, he is blaspheming the Name. Therefore, it is said of false swearing: &#x201C;Thou hast hereby defiled the name of thy God; I am the Lord&#x201D; (Lev. 19. 12). And if he commits the offense in the presence of ten Israelites, he is guilty of public blasphemy. Conversely, if one abstains from sin, or fulfills a commandment without ulterior motive, not because of terror or fear, nor in pursuit of honor, but merely for the sake of the Creator, blessed is He! Even as Joseph the Pious did resist the temptation of his master&#x2019;s wife, behold, he doth sanctify the Name of God.</p>
<p>11. There are other things included in blasphemy, although they are not of themselves either among the mandatory or prohibitive commandments, as for example, when a great man, famed for his learning and piety, will do something that the public will suspect him on account thereof, even though such deeds be not transgressions, yet he has committed blasphemy, as for example: if he makes a purchase and does not pay for it at once,<sup><xref rid="fn61">10</xref></sup> although he has the money and the vendors are claiming it and he delays them; or if he indulges in frivolity, or doth eat and drink with and among the ignorant,<sup><xref rid="fn62">11</xref></sup> or if his speech with his fellow men be not polite, or if he does not receive them pleasantly, but acts as one looking for strife and shows anger. In such and like matters, all measured by the standard of the greatness of such scholar, he must take particular care, and act exceedingly better than the law requires. Conversely, if the scholar restrains himself, speaks politely to his fellow men, and when among them acts like one of them, and receives them pleasantly, takes abuse from them but never gives abuse to them in return, respects them, even those who do not respect him, acts in business honestly, does not remain in company with the unlearned, nor visits their assemblies, and is rarely seen otherwise than to be engaged in the study of the Torah, wrapt in the prayer-garment and adorned with phylacteries, and performs his duties exceedingly more than the law requires, provided he does not go to extremes and does not act so ridiculously, so that all praise him and love him and crave to imitate his actions, behold he doth sanctify the Lord, and concerning him, the verse speaks, saying: &#x201C;And He said unto me, thou art my servant, Israel, in whom I am glorified.&#x201D; (Is. 49.3).</p>
<h1><p>CHAPTER VI</p></h1>
<p>1. Whosoever willfully destroys an inscription of any of the Holy and Pure Names by which the Holy One, blessed is He! is called, <sup><xref rid="fn63">1</xref></sup>is guilty of a sin punishable under the laws of the Torah with flogging. For, behold, it is said of idolatry: &#x201C;And ye shall destroy their name from that place, but ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God&#x201D; (Deut. 22.3&#x2013;4).</p>
<p>2. There are seven such names:<sup><xref rid="fn64">2</xref></sup> Tetragrammaton, but written to be pronounced Lord, All Powerful; God; God of the universe; God of our Fathers; Almighty; and Hosts. Whosoever erases even one letter of these seven Names is flogged.</p>
<p>3. All affixes to any of these Names such as the letter Lamad, meaning <italic>to</italic> or the letter Beth, meaning <italic>from</italic> God, may be erased, but the suffixes, such as the letter Caph at the end of the Name meaning <italic>thy</italic> God, or the letters Caph and Mem at the end of the Name, meaning <italic>your</italic> God, and like letters must not be erased, for they are as sacred as the other letters of the Name, because the Name itself hallows them. Nevertheless, whosoever erases one of these suffixes, is not flogged, but punished after the manner of a rebel.<sup><xref rid="fn65">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. <sup><xref rid="fn66">4</xref></sup>If the Aleph-Lamad of the Name of God of the universe, or Yod-Heh of the Tetragrammaton be written, they must not be erased; needless to mention the Yod Heh of the Tetragrammaton as together they constitute a Name by itself, in addition to being part of the Tetragrammaton; but the Shin-Dalat of the Name Almighty, or the Zadi-Beth of the Name Lord of Hosts, may be erased.</p>
<p>5. All other attributes by which the Holy One, blessed is He! is praised, such as Graceful, Merciful, Great, Powerful, Awe-inspiring, Faithful, Jealous, Mighty and the like, are like other words of Holy Writ which may be erased.<sup><xref rid="fn67">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. A vessel with a Name inscribed thereon, the part whereon the Name appears must be cut out and hidden.<sup><xref rid="fn68">6</xref></sup> Even when a Name be engraved on a vessel of metal or glass, if he deliberately recasts the vessel he is lashed, for the engraved part should be cut out and hidden. Likewise, if one had a Name written upon his flesh, he shall not wash, anoint himself or remain in unclean places; if he must undergo a mandatory emersion, he shall cover it with a leaf or, when no leaf is to be found, with part of his garments, yet must he not fasten it lest it be obstructive to the emersion, as it was not said to cover it save only because it is forbidden to remain nude in the Presence of the Name.<sup><xref rid="fn69">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. He who wilfully destroys even one stone of the altar, or of the Temple, or of any other part of the Court, is lashed; for it is said with respect to idolatry: &#x201C;For their altars must ye demolish,&#x201D; and it is written: &#x201C;Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God&#x201D; (Deut. 12.4)<sup><xref rid="fn70">8</xref></sup>; Likewise, if one willfully sets fire to trees intended for sacred use is lashed, for it is said: &#x201C;And their sacred trees ye shall burn in fire,&#x201D; and it is also written: &#x201C;Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God&#x201D; (Ibid).<sup><xref rid="fn71">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. All the Holy Scriptures and their exegesis and commentaries, must not be burned or otherwise willfully destroyed, and whosoever willfully destroys them is punished by being smitten as a rebel. Whereat are these words directed? Only with respect to sacred writings which were written in sacredness by an Israelite; but if an atheist, even though an Israelite, wrote a Book of the Torah, such book must be burned together with the mentioned Names therein, because he believes not in the sacredness of the Name, and surely did not write it in His name, but thought of it merely as of secular matters, and because his mind was such, no Name therein was sanctified. Moreover, it is mandatory to burn it so that there be left no monument either to the infidels or to their works. But if an idolater wrote the Name, it shall be hidden. Likewise, volumes of the Holy Scriptures which became moth-eaten, or which were written by an idolater, shall be hidden.<sup><xref rid="fn72">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. All the Names mentioned in connection with Abraham, are sacred, even this one, saying: &#x201C;My Lord, if now I have found grace&#x201D; (Gen. 18.3), is sacred. All the names mentioned in connection with Lot are profane, save this one: &#x201C;Not so my Lord, I pray Thee, behold if now Your servant has found grace&#x201D; (Ibid. 19. 18.19). All the Names mentioned in connection with Geboth Benjamin (Judg. 20) are sacred. All the names mentioned in connection with Micha (Ibid. 17) are profane. All the Names mentioned in connection with Naboth (I Kings 21.3) are sacred. Every Solomon mentioned in Song of Songs is sacred, and it is like the other Attributes, save only the one saying: &#x201C;Thou, O Solomon, shall have the thousand&#x201D; (Song of Songs VIII, 12). Every mention of King in Daniel is profane, save this one where it is said: &#x201C;Thou art the King of Kings&#x201D; (Dan. 2.37),<sup><xref rid="fn73">12</xref></sup> and it is like the other Attributes.</p>
<h1><p>CHAPTER VII</p></h1>
<p>1. It is a fundamental part of religion to acknowledge that God bestows prophecy upon the sons of men. But prophecy does not descend<sup><xref rid="fn74">1</xref></sup> save upon a wise man, eminent in wisdom, of sterling character, never subdued by worldly passion, but conquering it by an ever-present will-power, broadminded and settled to the highest degree. A man, endowed with all these moral principles, of sound physique, when he enters the Vineyard and is carried away with the current of these great and remote subjects, and possessed of a mind ready to understand and attain, he continuing to gain in saintliness, separated from the general public which follows the dark paths of the times, continuing to take care of himself, training his soul to heed no thought in idle affairs nor in the vanities and phantasies of the time, but his mind be constantly ready and directed Upward, connected to the Throne Beneath, to understand the Holy and Pure Intelligences and to penetrate the scope of Wisdom of the Holy One, blessed is He! from the First Intelligence even unto the summit of the earth to know from them His greatness &#x2014;immediately the Holy Spirit will rest upon him. And, when the Spirit will rest upon him his soul will be mingling with the Angels of the degree of the Sphere called Men, and will be transformed into another being, and will understand his own intelligence that he is not as he was, but that he was elevated above the degree of other wise sons of man, as it is said of Saul: &#x201C;And thou shalt prophesy among them and thou shalt be turned into another man&#x201D; (I Sam. 10.6).</p>
<p>2. Prophets are of various degrees. Even as there is in wisdom, one wise man greater than his fellow, so it is in prophecy, one prophet is greater than another prophet. But all of them do not see the vision of prophecy save in a dream, in a vision by night, or during the day when a deep slumber falls upon them, as it is said: &#x201C;I become known to him in vision; I speak to him in a dream&#x201D; (Num. 12.6). And they all, when they prophesy, tremble in all their limbs, the strength of their bodies gives way, their thinking power becomes unbalanced, the sense of understanding alone remains open to grasp what it will see, as it is said of Abraham: &#x201C;And behold, a great trembling and darkness befell upon him&#x201D; (Gen. 15.12); and as it is said of Daniel: &#x201C;For my comeliness was turned into corruption, and I retained no strength&#x201D; (Dan. 10.8).</p>
<p>3. The matters concerning which a prophet is informed by vision of prophecy, are imparted to him allegorically, but the interpretation thereof is engraved upon his heart simultaneously with the vision and he knows what it means, as the vision of the ladder which Jacob our father saw: &#x201C;The angels of God were ascending and descending upon it&#x201D; (Gen. 28.12); which was a parable, the interpretation of which is the rise and fall of kingdoms, or as the Living Creatures which Ezekiel saw (Ezek. 1. 1&#x2013;27), or the Seething Pot and the Almond Rod which Jeremiah saw (Jer. 1.12&#x2013;13), or the Scroll of Parchment which Ezekiel saw (Ezek. 2.9), or the Measure which Zechariah saw (Zech. 2.5). And so with the rest of the prophets; some of them relate the parable and its interpretation as these; others relate the interpretation alone; and still others relate the parable only without the interpretation, as parts of the prophecies of Ezekiel and Zechariah, but all of them are prophesying in parables and metaphors.</p>
<p>4. All the prophets do not prophesy every time they may desire, but they must prepare their minds, rest in a state of exultation and hearty contentment, and in undisturbed solitude; for, prophecy does not rest upon any prophet either when he is in a state of melancholy or in a state of indolence, but when he is in a state of delightfulness.<sup><xref rid="fn75">2</xref></sup> Therefoer, the disciples of the prophets had before them the harp, the timbrel, the flute and the violin when they were seeking the spirit of prophecy, whereof it is said: &#x201C;And they strove to prophecy&#x201D; (I Sam. 10.5), meaning, they followed the path of prophecy until they did prophesy, as one says: &#x201C;Yonder is one aspiring to become great.&#x201D;</p>
<p>5. They that seek the spirit of prophecy are called disciples of the prophets, and, although they train their minds well, it is uncertain whether the Shekinah will rest upon them or whether it will not.</p>
<p>6. All the things hereinof spoken is the path of prophecy for all prophets, First and Last, save Moses our Master, the Master of all prophets. And what division is there between the prophecy of Moses and that of all the other prophets? All the other prophets prophesied while in a dream, or in a vision, but Moses our Master prophesied while awake and standing up, as it is said: &#x201C;And when Moses went into the tent of meeting that He might speak with Him, then he heard the Voice speaking unto him&#x201D; (Num. 7.89); all other prophets received it through an Angel, they therefore saw what they did see in the form of allegory and riddles, but Moses our Master did not receive it through an angel, for it is said: &#x201C;With him do I speak mouth to mouth&#x201D; (Ibid. 12.8), and it is also said: &#x201C;and the Lord spoke unto Moses face to face&#x201D; (Ex. 33.11); and it is further said: &#x201C;And the similitude of the Lord doth he behold&#x201D; (Num. 12.8); which is to say that there is no manner of parable, for he sees the matter in its clearness without riddle and without parable, which is as the Torah testifies concerning him: &#x201C;Even manifestly, and not in dark speeches&#x201D; (Ibid.); he does not prophesy in dark speech but by sight for he sees the matter in its clearness; all prophets are awe-stricken, trembling and faint, but Moses our Master is not so, which is as the Verse says: &#x201C;As a man speaketh unto his friend&#x201D; (Ex. 33.11), meaning, that as no man trembles to hear the words of his friend, so was the power of the mind of Moses our Master to understand the words of prophecy, he remaining upright at his post unaffected; all other prophets could not prophesy any time they wanted, but not so Moses our Master, who at any time he desired, the Holy Spirit covered him, and prophecy rested upon him, and he needed not to prepare his mind, or be in readiness to meet it, as he was prepared and ready constantly like unto the ministering Angels. He, therefore, prophesied at all times, even as it is said: &#x201C;Stand ye and let me hear what God will command concerning you&#x201D; (Num. 9.8). Moreover, in this, Almighty assured him, saying: &#x201C;Go and say to them, &#x2018;Return ye to your tents&#x2019; and, as for thee, remain standing with me here&#x201D;(Deut. 5.30&#x2013;31). Herefrom we learn that all other prophets, when the spirit of prophecy departs from them, return to their tent for their bodily needs, they all, like unto the rest of the people. Therefore, do they not remain separated from their wives. But Moses our Master returned not again to his erstwhile abode, he therefore separated himself forever from his wife and from like matters; his intellect became apprenticed to the Rock of the Universe; glory never departed from him; his countenance became adorned with rays of light, and his saintliness was like that of Angels.</p>
<p>7. A prophet may possess the spirit of prophecy for his own sake alone, to broaden his mind and increase his knowledge so that he may know that which he did not know of certain great matters, or he may be sent to a nation of among the nations of the world, or to the inhabitants of a city, or to a government to establish them righteously, to instruct them what to do, or to restrain them from the evil deeds on their hands; and when he is so sent he is given a token or miracle so that the people may know that he is in truth the messenger of God. Nevertheless, not every one who delivers a token or performs a miracle should be believed to be a prophet; for only such man whom we knew heretofore to be worthy of prophecy, both by his wisdom and by his conduct, in consequence whereof he was above all his associates, and walked in the requisite ways of prophecy, in its holiness and self-denial, if, thereafter, he came and delivered a token and performed a miracle and said that he is a messenger of God, it is a mandatory commandment to hearken unto him, for it is said: &#x201C;Unto him ye shall hearken&#x201D; (Deut. 18.15). And yet, it is even possible that one such will deliver a token and perform a miracle and not be a prophet; as for the token, it might contain some doubtful matter; notwithstanding this, it is mandatory to hearken unto him; for, seeing that he is a great man, wise and worthy of being a prophet, he must be sustained on the presumption that he is a prophet. In this we were commanded to do as we were commanded to base a legal decision upon the testimony of two proper witnesses, even though they may have testified falsely, yet, because we consider them to be proper, their testimony must stand upon their fitness, and concerning this and like matters it is said: &#x201C;The secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children&#x201D; (Deut. 29.28); and it is said: &#x201C;For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart&#x201D; (I Sam. 16.7).</p>
<h1><p>CHAPTER VIII</p></h1>
<p>1. Moses our Master was not believed in by Israel because he delivered tokens, for whosoever bases his belief contingent upon tokens retains suspicion in his heart, for it is possible that the token was delivered by means of enchantment and witchcraft. But all the tokens delivered by Moses in the wilderness were responsive to necessities, and not as testimony for prophecy. When it became necessary to have the Egyptians sunk, he divided the sea and drowned them therein; when our need was food, he brought down for us Manna; when they became thirsty, he split open the rock for them; when the Korah confederacy denied him, the earth swallowed them up. Likewise came to pass all the other tokens. Wherein, then, did they believe in him? In being present at Mount Sinai; for our own eyes saw and not through a stranger&#x2019;s, and our own ears heard and not that of another; the flame, the thunder and lightning, and he drew near the thick cloud and the Voice speaking unto him, we listening, saying: &#x201C;Moses, Moses, go and tell them thus and such,&#x201D; for so he also said: &#x201C;The Lord spoke with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of fire&#x201D; (Deut. 5.4); and it is moreover said: &#x201C;The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us&#x201D; (Ibid. &#x2013;31). Whencefrom do we know that the standing at Mount Sinai alone is the evidence which makes his prophecy true without a shadow of suspicion? Because it is said: &#x201C;Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak unto thee, and may also believe thee forever&#x201D; (Ex. 19.9). Evidently, hitherto they did not believe in him with an everlasting belief, but with a belief wherein there is after-thought and reflection.<sup><xref rid="fn76">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Consequently they to whom he was sent are the witnesses by whom the truth of his prophecy is established, wherefor he needed no other token to deliver to them, as they and he witnessed it together, and as when two witnesses see one thing together each one testifies for the other that he speaks the truth, and neither needs other testimony for the other. Thus, Moses our Master, all Israel are his witnesses since their presence at Mount Sinai, and there was no need for him to deliver to them any token. This is what the Holy One, blessed is He! spoke unto him, when he commenced to prophesy, at the time He endowed him with the tokens to be delivered in Egypt, saying to him: &#x201C;And they shall hearken to thy voice&#x201D; (Ex. 3.18). Moses our Master knew that whosoever believes on the testimony of tokens retains in his heart suspicions and continues to think and reflect; and he endeavored not to go, saying: &#x201C;But, behold, they will not believe me&#x201D; (Ibid. 4.1). Then it was that the Holy One, blessed is He! made known to him that these tokens were of no need save until they go forth out of Egypt, but after they go forth, when they will stand upon this Mount the suspicious thoughts which they might be thinking after thee will disappear, for I am herewith investing thee with a token which they will know in truth that it was I Who sent thee from the very start, so that there be left no suspicion in their heart. And it is this what the Verse says: &#x201C;And this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain&#x201D; (Ibid. 3. 12). Consequently, it must be said that in every prophet who rises up after Moses our Master, we do not believe because of the token alone, so as to say: &#x201C;If he deliver a token we will hearken to all of his prophesying&#x201D;; but because of the commandment which Moses commanded in the Torah and said, if he do give a token, &#x201C;Unto him ye shall hearken&#x201D; (Deut. 18.15). Even as he commanded us to render decision in a matter on the testimony of two witnesses, although we do not know whether they have testified truth or falsehood, so it is mandatory to hearken to such prophet, notwithstanding our lack of knowledge whether the token is true or whether it was delivered by witchcraft and enchantment.</p>
<p>3. Therefore, if a prophet arose and performed great tokens and miracles, and thereby seeks to deny the prophecy of Moses our Master, we must not hearken unto him, for we know clearly that those tokens are of enchantment and witchcraft, because the prophecy of Moses our Master is not based upon the tokens so as to make a comparison between the tokens of this one and the tokens of that one; for with our own eyes we saw it, and with our own ears we heard it even as he himself heard. This is rather to be compared to witnesses who testify before a man concerning a matter which he saw with his own eyes that it is not as he saw it, who does not hearken to them, but certainly knows that they are false witnesses. Therefore it is said in the Torah, if even the sign or the wonder come to pass: &#x201C;Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet&#x201D; (Ibid. 13.3). Behold, this one comes to thee with token and wonder to deny that which thou didst see with thine own eyes; whereas we do not believe in a miracle save because of the commandments which Moses commanded us, how will we accept this token which is brought to deny the prophecy of Moses which we saw and heard?</p>
<h1><p>CHAPTER IX</p></h1>
<p>1. It is a clear and manifest principle concerning the Torah that as a Law it is permanently established forever and evermore; and that it is not subject to mutibility, nor to diminution, nor to amendment; for it is said: &#x201C;All this word which I command you, that shall ye observe to do; thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it&#x201D; (Ibid. 13.1); and it is further said: &#x201C;But the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law&#x201D; (Ibid. 29.28). Herefrom we learn that according to all the words of the Torah we are commanded to do forever. It is, moreover, said: &#x201C;a statute forever throughout your generations&#x201D; (Num. 15.15); and again it is said:<sup><xref rid="fn77">1</xref></sup> &#x201C;It is not in heaven&#x201D; (Deut. 30.12); herefrom we learn that no prophet is thereafter permitted to make any innovation. Therefore, should a man rise up, whether he be from among the Gentiles or whether from among Israel, and deliver a token and perform a miracle saying, that God hath sent him to add a commandment, or to diminish a commandment, or to interpret a certain commandment of among the commandments with such interpretation as we have not heard by tradition from Moses; or he said, that these commandments with which Israel was charged are not forever and throughout all generations, but that they were commandments in keeping with those times only, behold him, he is a false prophet, seeing that he came to deny the prophecy of Moses; and his punishment is death by strangulation, because he wilfully spoke in the name of God concerning that which He did not charge him; for He, blessed is He! commanded Moses, saying, that this enactment was &#x201C;unto us and unto our children forever&#x201D; (Deut. 29.28); and, &#x201C;God is not a man that He should lie&#x201D; (Num. 23.19).</p>
<p>2. If it be so, wherefore is it said in the Torah: &#x201C;I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethern, like unto thee&#x201D; (Deut. 18.18)? Indeed, not to establish a religion is he to come, but to command concerning the words of the Torah and warn the people not to transgress it, as the last of among them said: &#x201C;Remember ye the Torah of Moses My servant&#x201D; (Mal. 3.22). Likewise if he command us concerning secular things, for example: Go ye to yon place, or do not go; join battle this day, or do not join, construct this fortress, or do not construct it, it is mandatory to hearken unto him, and whosoever deliberately disregards his words has forfeited his life to Heaven, for it is said: &#x201C;And it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto My words which he shall speak in my Name, I will require it of him&#x201D; (Deut. 18.19).<sup><xref rid="fn78">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. Likewise, a prophet who violates his own words, or who witholds his prophecy forfeits his life to Heaven, and of the three it is said: &#x201C;I will require it of him&#x201D; (Ibid.). Moreover, should a prophet, who is known to us as a prophet, charge us to violate one of all the commandments spoken of in the Torah, or many commandments, whether minor or major, it is mandatory to hearken unto him, if it be a need of the time. Thus did we learn traditionally from the early sages: &#x201C;In all matters, if the prophet tell thee to forego the words of the Torah, even as Elijah on Mount Carmel did, hearken unto him, save only in idolatry&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn79">3</xref></sup> Provided, however, that the violation be temporary as, for example, Elijah on Mount Carmel, who sacrificed a burnt-offering without, whereas Jerusalem was chosen the only place therefor, and whosoever sacrifices without is guilty and suffers excision. And, because he is a prophet, it is mandatory to hearken unto him, for even in this it is said: &#x201C;Unto him ye shall hearken&#x201D; (Deut. 18.15). Had they at that time asked Elijah, and said unto him: How can we abolish that which it is written in the Torah: &#x201C;Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest&#x201D; (Ibid. 12.13)? He would have replied: &#x201C;This is not spoken of save against the one who sacrifices without continuously who is guilty and suffers excision, even as Moses hath commanded; but I am sacrificing this day without, because God wills it, so as to deny the prophets of Baal.&#x201D; In such manner, if all the prophets command to violate aught temporary, it is mandatory to hearken to them; but if they say that the matter be abolished forever, the one saying so is punished with death by strangulation, for the Torah said: &#x201C;Unto us and to our children forever&#x201D; (Ibid. 29.28).</p>
<p>4. In like manner, if he abolish aught of the things which we did learn by tradition, or if he say concerning a given law of the laws of the Torah that God charged him to interpret the law thus, and that the law should be decided in favor of that man, behold, he is a false prophet, and shall be strangled, even though he delivered a token; for, lo, he came to refute the Torah wherein it is said: &#x201C;It is not in heaven&#x201D; (Ibid. 30.12). Nevertheless, if his charge be of a temporary nature, we must hearken unto him in everything.</p>
<p>5. All these matters were said only concerning the rest of the commandments, but concerning idolatry he must not be listened to, even it be temporary, and even if he delivered great tokens and performed great miracles and said that God commanded him that idolatry should be worshipped this day only, or this hour only; for, lo, this one spoke perversion against God, and concerning such one Holy Writ commanded, saying: &#x201C;And the sign and the wonder come to pass&#x2026;Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet&#x2026;Because he hath spoken perversion against the Lord your God&#x201D; (Ibid. 13. 2.4.6); and, lo, he came to refute the prophecy of Moses, we therefore know of a certainty that he is a false prophet, and all that which he did was done by enchantment and witchcraft, and he shall be strangled.</p>
<h1><p>CHAPTER X</p></h1>
<p>1. Every prophet who will arise among us and say that he is the messenger of God, is not obliged to deliver a token like unto one of the tokens of Moses our Master, or Elijah, or Elisha, wherein there is a change in the natural laws of the universe. But his token should be by foretelling things which are to come to pass in the world, and his words come true; as it is said: &#x201C;And if thou wilt say in thy heart: &#x2018;How shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken?&#x2019; When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him&#x201D; (Deut.18.21&#x2013;22). Therefore, if a man, fit for prophecy, come as a messenger of the Name, and he comes not to add to nor diminish from but to advocate the service of God according to the commandments of the Torah, it is not said to him: &#x201C;Divide the sea before us, or resurrect the dead, or perform like miracles, and then only shall we believe in thee&#x201D;. But it shall be said unto him: &#x201C;If thou be a prophet, fortell things which are to come to pass&#x201D;. If he, indeed, foretells, we wait to see whether his words will come to pass or whether they will not come to pass, when, if even a minute detail be wanting it is certain that he is a false prophet. But if all of his words come to pass, he must be in our eyes trustworthy.</p>
<p>2. The examination must be continued many times; if all of his words be found true, 10, this is a true prophet, as it is said of Samuel: &#x201C;And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-Sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord&#x201D; (I Sam. 3.20).</p>
<p>3. Are not the necromancers and astrologists foretelling what is to come to pass, what, then, is the difference between a prophet and such as they? Forsooth, necromancers, astrologists and their like, some of their words are established and some of their words are not established, as the subject is spoken of: &#x201C;Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from <italic>some</italic> of the things that shall come upon thee&#x201D; (Is. 47.13); &#x2014;of <italic>some</italic> of the things are spoken, but not of <italic>all</italic> of the things, because they are not capable to foretell all of the things. Moreover, it is possible, too, that none of their words be established, for they may entirely be misled, as the subject is spoken of: &#x201C;That frustrateth the tokens of the imposters, and maketh diviners mad&#x201D; (Ibid. 44.25). But as for the prophet, all of his words are established, as it is said: &#x201C;Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the Lord&#x201D; (II Kings 10.10); again it is said: &#x201C;the prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath My word, let him speak My word faithfully, What hath the straw to do with the wheat? saith the Lord&#x201D; (Jer. 23.28), meaning that the words of astrologers and dreamers are likened to straw wherein there was mixed a few grains of wheat, but the word of the Lord is like unto wheat wherein there is no straw at all. Herein the Verse gave assurance saying, that as for the things that the necromancers and astrologers foretell falsely to the nations, the prophet will inform you in true words, and you have no need for necromancer, or astrologer, or his like, as it is said: &#x201C;There shall not be found among you anyone that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one that useth divination, a soothsayer, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer, or a charmer, or one that consulteth a ghost, or a familiar spirit, or a necromancer . . For these nations, that thou art to dispossess, hearken unto sooth-sayers, and unto diviners&#x201D; (Deut. 18. 10. 11. 14); and it is then said: &#x201C;A prophet will the Lord thy God raise up unto thee&#x201D; (Ibid. 15). Herefrom you learn that the presence of a prophet among us is for no other purpose save that of foretelling things that are to come to pass in the world such as plenty, famine, war, peace and like matters. For, even of private matters he is informed. For instance, Saul when he sustained a loss he went to a prophet to inquire for its whereabouts.<sup><xref rid="fn80">1</xref></sup> Similar matters to these the prophet may tell, not to create another religion, or add a commandment, or diminish.</p>
<p>4. Concerning a prophet&#x2019;s prediction of calamities, such one would die, or such year would be visited by famine, or war, or matters similar to these, even though his words be not established, it is not considered contradictory to his prophecy. It shall not be said: &#x201C;Behold, he spoke and it did not come to pass!&#x201D; For, the Holy One, blessed is He! is long-suffering and abundant in goodness, and repenteth Him of the evil, and it is possible that they repented and were forgiven, as did the inhabitants of Nineveh,<sup><xref rid="fn81">2</xref></sup> or that their fate was postponed, as was with Hezekiah.<sup><xref rid="fn82">3</xref></sup> But if he assured that good would come to pass, saying that it would be thus and such, but the good he promised did not come to pass, it is certain that he is a false prophet, for every good thing God decides upon, even though it be contingent, He doth not repent. And, we find no instance when He repented from a good thing save only at the destruction of the First Temple, when he assured the righteous that they would not die together with the wicked and retracted it, as it appears in Tractat Shabbat<sup><xref rid="fn83">4</xref></sup>. Herefrom we learn that a prophet is tested solely by his prophecy concerning good tidings, which is in harmony with what Jeremiah said in his reply to Hananiah son of Azzur, when Jeremiah was prophesying evil tidings and Hananiah good, saying unto him: &#x201C;If my words will not be established, it would yet not be evidence that I am a false prophet; but if thy words be not established it will be proclaimed that thou art a false prophet&#x201D;. For it is said: &#x201C;Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people: The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against many kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence; the prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him&#x201D; (Jer. 28.7&#x2013;9).</p>
<p>5. A prophet of whom another prophet testified that he is a prophet, behold, he is an established prophet and he needs no further test; for, behold, Moses our Master vouched for Joshua and all Israel believed in him before he ever delivered a token, so must it be throughout the generations. A prophet whose prophecy had already been proclaimed, and whose words were believed time after time, or if another prophet gave testimony concerning him, and he continued to follow the paths of prophecy, must not be looked upon with suspicious thoughts, or question the truth of his prophecy. And it is forbidden to test him more than necessary, or go on testing him forever for, it is said: &#x201C;Ye shall not try the Lord your God, as ye tried Him in Massah&#x201D; (Deut. 6.16), when they said: &#x201C;Is the Lord among us, or not&#x201D; (Ex. 17.7). But, since a prophet is proclaimed they should believe and know that God is among them, and not suspect nor whisper behind his back, as it is said concerning the subject: &#x201C;Yet shall they know that there hath been a prophet among them&#x201D; (Eze.2.5).</p>

<chapter>
<title>THE TREATISE OF ETHICS</title>
<p>Embraces eleven commandments; five mandatory and six prohibitive, namely: (1) to imitate His ways; (2) to cleave to His adherers; (3) to love neighbors; (4) to love strangers; (5) not to hate neighbors; (6) to rebuke; (7) not to put any one to shame; (8) not to afflict the unfortunate; (9) not to bear tales; (10) not to seek vengeance; (11) not to bear a grudge. And the interpretation of all these commandments is given in the succeeding chapters.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER I</h1>
<p>1. Each and every one of the sons of man has many innate tendencies which differ one from the other and which are extremely afar. There is one man of a feverish temperment, constantly vexed, and there is another man of a calm disposition, without angry moods whatever, and if he does show anger it is but one bit of anger in many years; one man is overmuch supercilious, and another man is extremely unobtrusive; one is sensual, whose being is never stilled by the pursuit of propensity, and one is so pure-hearted that he feels no craving even for the barest necessities of the body; one&#x2019;s being is so greedy that the world&#x2019;s money will not satisfy him, as the subject is spoken of: &#x201C;He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver&#x201D; (Ecc. 5.10); and one&#x2019;s being is so restrained that he considers enough even part of the little which is insufficient for his need and he will not pursue to attain all needs; one suffers hunger in his effort of hoarding and does not eat a cent&#x2019;s worth of his own without great torture to himself, and another wastes his money with his own hand deliberately. And of such ways are all the rest of the tendencies, as the optimist and pessimist, miser and philanthropist, cruel and merciful, coward and stout-hearted and the like.</p>
<p>2. And there are between each and every extreme tendency of an opposite vein mean tendencies one distinct from the other. Pertaining to tendencies in general, there are such tendencies which a man acquires at his birth, in keeping with the nature of his body; and there are particular tendencies to which a particular person is by nature prepared to acquire them more aptly than other tendencies; there are among them such which do not come naturally to a person at his birth, but which he learns from others, or by leaning towards them as a result of a thought invented by his heart, or by having heard that this particular tendency is good for him and proper to follow it, and he did follow it until it was set in his heart.</p>
<p>3. The two extremes in each and every tendency is not a good way, and it is not proper for a man to follow them, nor to have himself instructed in them. If one finds his nature leaning toward one of them, or susceptible to one of them, or if he already acquired one of them and followed it, he should turn himself toward goodness by following the path of the good which is the straight path.</p>
<p>4. The straight path is the mean disposition found in each and every tendency of all the human tendencies. Such tendency is removed from both extremes an equal distance, and is not nearer to one than to the other. Therefore have the wise men of yore commanded that man should ever review his tendencies,<sup><xref rid="fn84">1</xref></sup> estimate them, and direct them toward the middle-path so that he will be sound in body. How may one do it? He should not be an excitable person, easily angered; nor like the dead without feelings, but adopt a middle-course, not to become indignant, save only at something big which is worthy enough to be angry at, so that the like should not be done another time. Likewise shall he not crave for aught save the things which the body requires, and without which it is impossible to be, as the subject is spoken of: &#x201C;The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul&#x201D; (Pro. 13.25). Likewise shall he not continue to fatigue himself in his affairs, save to acquire what is necessary for him to live on for the time being as the subject is mentioned, saying: &#x201C;A little that a righteous man hath is better&#x201D; (Ps. 47.16). He should not be too close-fisted, nor yet squander his money, but give Z&#x2019;dakah within the means of his hand, and lend accordingly to the needy. He should not be too optomistic and playful, nor too pessimistic and mournful, but spend all of his days in good cheer and with a pleasant countenance. So should he measure all the rest of his tendencies. And this path is the path of the wise men. Every man whose tendencies are mean tendencies of the middle-course, is called wise.</p>
<p>5. One who controls himself with increased restrictions, and distances himself even from the mean tendency,<sup><xref rid="fn85">2</xref></sup> a little one way or a little the other way, is called devout. How may one do it? One who will distance himself from the extreme point of arrogance and become exceedingly humble is called devout for, this is the tendency of piety. If one distances himself to the mean point only and practices meekness he is called a wise man for, this is the tendency of wisdom. A like pathway exists in all the rest of the tendencies. The ancient devotees diverged their tendencies from the middle-path facing the two extremes; some tendency they bent opposite to the last extreme and some tendency they bent opposite the first extreme. This is more than being within the limits of the law.<sup><xref rid="fn86">3</xref></sup> As for us, we are charged to walk in these middle-paths, which are the good and straight paths, even as it is said: &#x201C;And thou shalt walk in His ways&#x201D; (Deut. 28 9).</p>
<p>6. In explaining this commandment the sages taught thus: Even as He is called gracious, be thou gracious; even as He is called merciful, be thou merciful; even as He is called holy, be thou holy.<sup><xref rid="fn87">4</xref></sup> In this wise did the prophets attribute to God all such terms as long-suffering, abundant in benificence, just and right, perfect, mighty and powerful and others like these, to proclaim that they are good and straight paths, and that man is obligated to lead himself in them, and to be like unto Him in proportion to his power.</p>
<p>7. And how may a man inure himself in these tendencies so that they be permanent with him? He should try once, repeat it, and do a third time the things he is called upon to do in harmony with the tendencies of the middle-course, and repeat the practice continuously until the doing it will be accomplished with slight effort, and they will not be burdensome upon him, then will the tendencies be a fixed part of his being. And because the Creator is termed by these attributes which are the middle-way, this way is called the Lord&#x2019;s way. And, it is even in this that Abraham our father instructed his sons, saying: &#x201C;For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, that they shall keep the way of the Lord&#x201D; (Gen. 18.19). And he who walks in this way brings goodness and blessing upon himself, even as it is said: &#x201C;In order that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken concerning him&#x201D; (Ibid.).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER II</h1>
<p>1. To the physically sick the bitter tastes sweet, and the sweet bitter. Of among the sick there may be one who craves and desires food which is unfit for cunsumption, for instance, dirt and coal, and despises good food such as bread and meat, according to the seriousness of the disease. Even so are people whose souls are sick; they desire and love the evil tendencies, and hate the good way, and are lazy to follow it, for it becomes a very heavy load upon them, in proportion to their ailment. Even so does Isaiah speak of such people: &#x201C;Woe unto those that say of the evil it is good, and of the good it is evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter&#x201D; (Is. 5.20). Respecting their like it is said: &#x201C;Who leave the path of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness&#x201D; (Prov. 2.13). And what is the corrective measure for the soul-sick? Let them go to the wise who are doctors of the souls and they will heal their disease with tendencies wherein they will instruct them until they will bring them back to the right way. And they that are conscious of their evil tendencies and do not go to the wise to be cured by them, concerning them Solomon said: &#x201C;Wisdom and instruction fools alone despise&#x201D; (Ibid. 1.7).</p>
<p>2. And how may their cure be? He who is of a hot temperment should be taught to demean himself this wise: If he be smitten and cursed, he must not feel the insult at all. and follow this way a long time until anger will be completely rooted out from his heart. And he who was arrogant should accustom himself to a life of extreme self-abasement by occupying the lowermost seat of everybody, and dress in such rags which shame those that wear them, and do such in like matters until the haughtiness of his heart will be rooted out of him, when he will return to the middle-way, which is the good way. But when he will return to the middle-way he should follow it throughout his lifetime. And this line he should follow in all the rest of his tendencies; if he had distanced himself to the extreme point of one he should remove himself to the extreme end of the other and follow it up a long time until he may return to the good way, which is the middle-standard in each and every tendency.</p>
<p>3. And, yet, there are certain tendencies which man is forbidden to follow in the middle-way, but must distance himself from extreme to extreme. The good way is not merely that man be meek, but that he should be humble-spirited, then his spirit will be extremely lowly. This is the reason why it is said of Moses that he was very meek (Num. 12.3) and not merely meek. This is also the reason why the sages commanded saying: &#x201C;Be exceedingly humble of spirit&#x201D; (Pir. Ab. iv. 4). They, moreover, said: &#x201C;He who is of a haughty heart denies the head principle&#x201D; (Sotah, 4b), even as it is said: &#x201C;Thine heart be then lifted up, and thou forget the Lord they God&#x201D; (Deut. 8.14); and they also said: &#x201C;Isolated be he in whom there is a haughty spirit, even a little thereof&#x201D; (Sotah. 5a). So is anger an extremely evil tendency and it is proper for man to remove himself from it to the other extreme. One should teach himself not to get angry, even over a matter which befits anger. If one desires to engender awe in his children and his household, or in the public, if he be at the head of a community, even if he desire to get angry at them so as to bring them back to the good way, he should only act angry in their presence so as to reprove them, but his disposition must remain calm within himself, even as a man imitates, who is angry when the time calls forth anger but in reality he is not angry. The sages of yore said: &#x201C;He who yields to anger is as if he worshiped idolatry&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn88">1</xref></sup> They also said: &#x201C;Whosoever yields to anger, if he be a wise man his wisdom leaves him, and if he be a prophet his prophecy leaves him.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn89">2</xref></sup> Verily the life of irritable persons is no life.<sup><xref rid="fn90">3</xref></sup> They have, therefore, commanded to be afar from anger, so that one will train himself not to mind even the things which do cause irritation, for such is the good way. The conduct of the just is to take insults but not give insults, hear themselves flouted but make no reply, do their duty as a work of love, and bear affliction cheerfully. Concerning them the Verse says: &#x201C;But may those that love Him be as the rising of the sun in his might&#x201D; (Judg. 5.31).</p>
<p>4. Ever let man multiply silence, and not speak aught else save in a matter of wisdom or of things which he needs for the sustenance of life in his body. Of Rab, the disciple of our Holy Master, it was said, that he never in his life uttered idle talk<sup><xref rid="fn91">4</xref></sup>. Verily, such is the talk of a majority of the people, whereas, even of the necessities of the body man should not multiply words. Concerning this the sages admonished, saying: &#x201C;Whosoever propogates words generates sin&#x201D; (Pir. Ab. 1.17). And they, moreover, said: &#x201C;I found nothing better for the body than silence&#x201D; (Ibid). Likewise in words of Torah and in words of wisdom shall man&#x2019;s words be few but the thought therein sagacious, which is what the sages charged saying: &#x201C;Ever let the master instruct his disciples concisely&#x201D; (Hullin. 63b). But if the words be many and their meaning insignificant it is but stupidity, concerning which it was said: &#x201C;For a dream cometh through a multitude of matter, and the voice of a fool cometh with a multitude of words&#x201D; (Ecc. 5.3).</p>
<p>5. Silence is the boundary of wisdom; therefore shall one not reply in haste, and not propogate speech. One shall instruct his disciples with forebearance and calmness, without vociferation and without circumlocution. That is what Solomon said: &#x201C;The words of the wise men, spoken quietly, are heard&#x201D; (Ibid. 9.17).</p>
<p>6. It is forbidden for man to demean himself by the use of the language of flattery and allurement; and he shall not be one thing with his mouth and another with his heart; but his inner and outer being must be the same, for the subject of the heart is the matter of the mouth. And, it is forbidden to steal the mind of people, even the mind of the alien. For example? One shall not sell to an alien meat of a beast that died of itself or that was improperly slaughtered (Nebelah) and represent that it was meat of an animal that was slaughtered properly; or shoes of the hide of a beast that died of itself and represent that it was of a slaughtered beast; one shall not urge his friend to dine with him, when he knows that he would not eat; nor over-burden him with offerings when he knows that he would not accept; nor open a barrel, which he must open for his trade, to talk in his friend that he opened it in his honor, and so other like deceptions. Even one word of allurement and stealing of mind is forbidden. But man must be of true lip, steadfast spirit, and pure heart, free from all travail and clamor.<sup><xref rid="fn92">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. Man shall not be frivolous and sarcastic, nor sad and pessimistic, but of good cheer. Thus said the wise men: &#x201C;Frivolity and light-headedness train man for prostitution&#x201D; (Pir. Ab.3). And they have commanded: Man shall not be boisterous in laughter, nor sad and forlorn, but receive every person with a kind expression upon his face.<sup><xref rid="fn93">6</xref></sup> And so should he not be a man of an over-ambitious soul rushing for wealth, nor despondent and idle from work; but a being with a goodly eye, engage in affairs but little and be occupied in the study of the Torah, and in that little portion of his he shall rejoice. He shall not be contentious, envious, covetous or vain-glorious. Thus have the wise men said: &#x201C;Envy, covetousness, and vain-gloriousness remove man from life&#x201D; (Pir. Ab. 4.25). As a general rule of the matter he should follow the tendency of the middle-course of each and every disposition to the end that all of his tendencies will be firmly in the center, which is as Solomon said: &#x201C;Balance well the track of thy foot, and let all thy ways be firmly right&#x201D; (Prov. 4.26).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER III</h1>
<p>1. Peradventure man will say: Seeing that envy, desire and vainglory and like tendencies are evil tendencies and remove man from life, I will separate myself from them exceedingly and reach their remotest extreme. Until he will eat no meat, drink no wine, marry no woman, dwell in no comfortable quarters, dress in no proper clothes but in a sack and coarse wool, and the like, as for instance the idolatrous priests do. Even such is an evil way, and it is forbidden to follow it. He who follows this way is called a sinner, for it is said of a Nazarite: &#x201C;And make an atonement for him, because he hath sinned against the soul&#x201D; (Num. 6.11), whereupon the sages said: &#x201C;If the Nazarite, who did not separate himself from aught but wine must have atonement, he who deprives himself from each and every thing how manifold must his atonement be&#x201D; (Baba Kama. 91b)!<sup><xref rid="fn94">1</xref></sup> Therefore did the sages command, saying: A man shall not deprive himself of ought save the things which the Torah itself deprived him of; nor shall he bind himself by vows and oaths to abstain from things which are permitted. They have even said: &#x201C;Is it not enough for thee what the Torah has forbidden, that thou doest forbid thyself even other things&#x201D; (Yeru. Nedarim. 7.37)? And in this rule are included such who are continuously fasting, for they are not in the good way, and the sages prohibited one from punishing himself with fast days. Concerning such and like matters Solomon admonished saying: &#x201C;Be not righteous overmuch; neither show thyself wise; why wouldst thou destroy thyself&#x201D; (Ecc. 7.16).</p>
<p>2. It is necessary for man to set his heart and all his efforts solely to know the Name, blessed is He! so that his sitting down, his rising up and his speech shall be facing this goal. How may he accomplish it? When he will buy, or sell, or do work for wages, he should not have in his heart the accumulation of money only but he should perform these duties as a means to acquire the necessities of the body, as food, drink, dwelling-place and marriage; likewise when he will eat, drink, or lead a family life, he should not set his heart upon these things for the sole enjoyment thereof, until, as a consequence he will not eat and drink save that which is sweet to the palate, and marry to gratify his sensuality only. But he shall set his heart to eat and drink solely in order to keep his body and limbs in good health. He, therefore, should not eat everything his palate craves for like a dog or an ass, but partake of the things which are wholesome to the body whether bitter or sweet; and he shall not eat food which is bad for the body even though it be sweet to the palate. For example? One whose body was feverish shall not eat meat, nor honey, and drink no wine, as the subject was proverbally expressed by Solomon: &#x201C;To eat too much honey is not good&#x201D; (Prov. 25.27); he should rather drink cichorium intybus, even though it is bitter, as a consequence whereof he will eat and drink solely as a remedial means so that he may become healthy and stay healthy, seeing that it is impossible for man to sustain life save by food and drink. Likewise<sup><xref rid="fn95">42</xref></sup> in connubial relation there shall be no coition save when it is of benefit to health, or to sustain species. One should, therefore, not yield to every urge, save when knowing that emission of semen is a helpful means medically or to sustain species.</p>
<p>3. He who follows the medical directions, but sets his heart merely to keep his body and limbs healthy and beget children to do his work and strive for his needs, such is not the good way. But he should set his heart to have a sound and strong body so that his soul be tranquil to acquire the knowledge of the Lord; for, it is impossible that one should comprehend and improve himself in scholarship when he is hungry, or sick, or when one of his limbs pains; but he should set his heart to have a son who, perhaps will be a great sage in Israel Consequently, one who follows such way all of his life, is constantly in God&#x2019;s service, even when he is buying and selling, even when he performs the grossest duty, seeing that his thought beneath it all is to find enough to satisfy his wants, so that his body be sound, ready to serve God. Even when one sleeps, if his sleep be purposeful so that his mind be rested, and rests his body so as to prevent himself from becoming sick and be unable to serve God as a result of sickness, it will be found that even his very sleep is part of his service to God, blessed is He! And on this subject the sages commanded and said: &#x201C;And let all thine actions be with devotion to the Name of God&#x201D; (Pir. Av. 2.17); and, concerning this Solomon in his wisdom said: &#x201C;In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He will make level thy paths&#x201D; (Prov. 3.6).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IV</h1>
<p>1. Seeing that the maintenance of the body in a healthy and sound condition is a God-chosen way, for, lo, it is impossible that one should understand or know aught of the divine knowledge concerning the Creator when he is sick, it is necessary for man to distance himself from things which destroy the body, and accustom himself in things which are healthful and life-imparting. These are: never shall man partake food save when hungry, nor drink save when thirsty; he shall not defer elimination even one minute, but the moment he feels the need to evacuate urine or feces he must rise immediately.</p>
<p>2. Man shall not eat his stomach-full, but should reduce about one fourth of the quantity which would sate him; nor shall he drink water during the meal, save a little mixed with wine; but when the food will commence to be digested in his bowels, he may drink whatever quantity he needs, nevertheless, he should not drink over-much water even after the food was digested. He shall not eat before a thorough examination of self whether there is a need for elimination. Man shall not eat without warming his body either by walking before mealtime, by some manual labor, or by some other form of exercise which will tire him. As a general rule, he shall exercise his body and tire it every day during the morning so that it will commence to perspire, when he shall rest a little until his spirit will be calm then eat. If he take a warm bath after hard exercise it is still better, after which he should rest a little then eat.</p>
<p>3. Ever after a man eats, he should remain for a time sitting in his place, or leaning on his left side; he shall not walk, ride horseback, tire himself, exercise his body, or ramble about ere the food in his stomach is digested; and he who does ramble about or tires himself after eating invites upon himself bad and serious ailments.</p>
<p>4. The day and the night consist of twenty-four hours. It is enough that a man should sleep a third of it, which is eight hours. But it should terminate at the end of the night, so that from the time he commences his sleep till sun-dawn will be eight hours. As a consequence whereof he will arise from his bed before sun-up.</p>
<p>5. Man shall not sleep with his face downward, nor with his face upward, but on his side; at the beginning of the night on his left side, and at the end of the night on his right side. He shall not sleep immediately after meals, but wait about three or four hours after eating. He shall not sleep in the day-time.</p>
<p>6. Things which soften the bowels, as grapes, figs, morus nigra, pears, cucumis melo, cucumis sativus, or cucurbita, man shall eat before partaking of the principal dishes, and not mix it with the other food, but wait a bit till it leaves the esophagus, then take his meal; and things which stiffen the bowels as pomum granatum, quince, apples, or persicum he may eat right after the meal. But of these he should not eat in large quantities.</p>
<p>7. When man desires to have fowl and beef in one meal, he should eat the meat of the fowl first; eggs and poultry in one meal, he should eat eggs first; meat of the flock and meat of the herd in one meal, he should eat the meat of the flock first; he should ever eat the lighter food first and the heavier food last.</p>
<p>8. During the summer season he should eat his food cold, and not much spices, and partake of vinegar; during the rainy season he should eat his food warm with a liberal dose of spices therein, and partake of some mustard and asafetida. And, in this way he may continue to do in cold zones and in warm zones, in each and every place that which is fit for it.</p>
<p>9. There are some extremely bad foodstuffs and it is proper that man should not eat them at any time. For instance, the large, salted, old fishes; or stale, salted cheese; or cummin and mushrooms; or old, salted meat; or unfermented wine; or stale odorous victuals; and likewise all kinds of food of a bad smell, or of extremely bitter taste, are to the body like poison. And there are some foodstuffs, while bad, are not as deadly as the former; it is, therefore, advisable for man to partake of them but little, and at long intervals; nor shall he accustom himself to make of them his staple food, or to partake of them constantly along with his staple food. For instance, large fishes, cheese, or milk older than twenty-four hours; meat of big oxen and big rams; beans, lentils, pease, bread made of barley, unleavened-bread, cabbage, leek, onions, garlick, mustard and raddish are all bad food, and it is inadvisable for man to partake of these save only a very small quantity, and during the rainy season only. But during the summer season he should not eat of them at all, save, however, beans and lentils are unfit to eat, neither in summer season nor in rainy season. Pumkins should be eaten during the summer season.</p>
<p>10. There are still other foodstuffs which are bad, but not as bad as these. They are: water fowl, young pigeons, dates, bread toasted in oil, or bread kneeded in oil, fine meal wherein no trace of bran was left, brine and herring-brine. Of these it is unfit to eat much. A wise man, who can control himself, and not be carried away by his desires, who would not eat of the named foodstuffs altogether, save when he needs them as a drug, behold, he is a strong man.</p>
<p>11. Man should ever avoid himself from fruits of trees, surely not to partake overmuch thereof, even dried, not to mention fresh; but unripe fruits are daggers to the body. Likewise are Carobs ever bad to eat. And all citrous fruits are bad, and must not be eaten but in small quantities during the summer season, or in warm zones. But figs, grapes and almonds are ever good to eat, whether dry or fresh; of them man may eat all he is in need of, but he should not make them part of his diet permanently, notwithstanding that they are better than all other fruits of the trees.</p>
<p>12. Honey and wine are bad for the young but food for the old, particularly in the rainy season. A man needs during the summer season but two-thirds of the food he consumes during the rainy season.</p>
<p>13. Man should ever endeavor to have his bowels soft, near a bit to looseness. Here is a general rule in medicine: As long as there is either complete constipation or the voiding comes with great effort, it is a warning of impending serious ailments. What with shall man cure his bowels if they be somewhat constipated? If he be young, he shall eat every morning salted things, scalded, spiced with olive oil, brine and salt, but without bread; or drink hot extract of spinach, or of Carob mixed with olive oil, brine and salt; if he be old, he should drink in the morning honey in warm water, and wait about four hours, then he may eat his breakfast; this way he shall continue one day or, if needed, three or four days, until his bowels will become soft.</p>
<p>14. And yet another rule was laid down with respect to the health of the body; As long as a man works, and tires himself out to the extreme, and does not eat to his full satiety, and his bowels are soft, no ailment will visit him, and his strength will increase, even though he partakes of foods which are considered bad.</p>
<p>15. But whosoever sits idle and takes no exercise, or who witholds eliminations of his bowels, or whose bowels are constipated, even though he will eat only good food and keep himself up after the prescribed medical rules, he will suffer pain all his life, and his strength will fade away. Ravenous eating is as deadly to the body of every man as poison, and is the base of all sickness; for, most diseases which visit man are not possible save either because of bad food, or because he fills up his bowels with overmuch food, even though the food be of good quality. Concerning this Solomon in his wisdom said: &#x201C;Whoso guardeth his mouth and his tongue guardeth his soul against distresses&#x201D; (Prov. 21.23), meaning, that whoso guards his mouth against bad food and ravenous eating, and his tongue from speaking aught but of the things he needs, guards his soul against distresses.</p>
<p>16. The way of proper bathing: A man should bathe once every seven days, but never at meal-time, nor when hungry, only when the food will commence to be digested. His whole body one should wash in warm water of a temperature which does not scald the body; save the head on which he may use water of a temperature which would scald the body. Then he should wash his body in lukewarm water, then in water of a temperature lower than that, until he should finish washing his body in cold water. But upon his head he shall use neither lukewarm nor cold water. During the rainy season he should not bathe in cold water. He should not bathe before he will perspire and tire out his whole body; neither should he remain long in the bath-house, but as soon as he will perspire and tire his body he should wash freely and depart. He should examine himself before he enters the bath-house and after his departure if there be a need for elimination of the bowels. Likewise one should examine himself that way continuously before and after meals, before and after coition, before and after exercise, before and after sleeping, totaling ten times.</p>
<p>17. On leaving the bath-house he shoud dress and cover his head in the outer room, so as not to expose himself to a draft, the precaution being necessary even during the summer season. After he departs from the bath-house he should linger a while till he be composed in spirit, and rested in body, and be rid of the warmth, after which he may eat. If he sleep a while, after leaving the bath-house, before he partakes of a meal, it is very good. He should not drink cold water immediately after leaving the bath-house, needless to say that he should not drink while in the bath-house. If he be thirsty when leaving the bath-house, and is unable to restrain himself he should mix the water with wine or honey and drink. If he massaged himself with oil while in the bath-house, in the rainy season, after taking a plunge, it is wholesome.</p>
<p>18. Man should not make a constant practice of blood-letting, and he should not let blood save when there is an extraordinary need for it. He should not let blood either during the summer season or during the rainy season, but a little in the spring (during the days of Nisan) and a little in the fall (during the days of Tishri). After his fiftieth year he should never let blood. Neither shall he let blood and go to a bath-house on the same day, nor let blood and start on a journey, nor on the day he returns from a journey; and on the day of blood-letting he should eat and drink less than his accustomed portion. On the day of blood-letting he should rest and not tire himself, nor take exercise, nor walk about.</p>
<p>19. Semen is the vigor of the body, its very life, and the light of the eyes, and its too frequent emission sets decay in the body, wastes its strength, and ends life itself, which is as Solomon in his wisdom said: &#x201C;Give not unto women thy vigor&#x201D; (Prov. 31.3). Whosoever indulges in sensuality ages before his time, his strength fails him, his eyes become dim, a foul odor issues from his mouth and from underneath his arms, the hair of his head, eye-brows, and eye-lids fall out; the hair of his beard, under his arms and his feet grow heavier, his teeth fall out, and many more ailments besides these come upon him. Doctors of medicine said: &#x201C;One in a thousand die of other diseases, and the rest of the thousand from overindulgence of sex. Therefore, must man be careful in this matter, if he desires to lead a good life. He should not yield to an urge save if his body be in good health and exceedingly vigorous, with involuntary erection despite diversion, and a pressure on the genitocrural arteries accompanied by warm wave over his body, when there is a hygienic need of relief. But he should not still an urge when sated and not when hungry, but after the food in his bowels be digested. Care should be taken, before and after, whether there is a need of elimination. Neither standing nor sitting; neither in the bath-house nor on the day of bathing; neither on the day of blood-letting nor on the day of departing for or returning from a journey; neither preceding nor following all these.</p>
<p>20. Whosoever trains himself in these ways which were pointed out, I assure him that he will encounter no sickness all of his days, until he will die of old age; he will need no doctor; his body will be sound and well preserved throughout his life, unless his body be bad from its very formation or if there be a visitation of a pestilence or famine upon the world.</p>
<p>21. But all of the aforesaid good rules none but the healthy should follow. One who is sick, or he who has a diseased limb, or one who followed bad habits for many years, for each of such there are different ways of cure and rules of conduct, according to the nature of his ailment, as it is more clearly stated in the book of medicine. As a rule a change in routine of life is the germ of disease.<sup><xref rid="fn96">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. Wherever there is no doctor of medicine to be found, whether one is healthy or whether one is sick, it is not advisable for any one to deviate from the rules of conduct laid down in this chapter, for each of these leads to a good goal.</p>
<p>23. In any city where these ten conveniences are not found a disciple of the wise is not permitted to live: a physician, a surgeon, a bath-house, a comfort-station, running water, as a river or spring, a house of worship, a school teacher, a recorder, a collector of charity, and a tribunal with police powers.<sup><xref rid="fn97">1</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER V.</h1>
<p>1. Even as the wise man is recognized by his wisdom and ideas, whereby he is distinguished from the rest of the public, so it is necessary for him to be distinguished in his conduct, eating, drinking, sexual relations, elimination, speech, rendevous, dress, temperate in words, and in his business relations. All these deeds should be aesthetic and exceedingly cultured. A disciple of the wise must not be voracious, but eat proper food to strengthen his body; but even of such food he shall not partake a large quantity, nor be after eating in order to have a full stomach, as those who fill themselves up with food and drink until their bellies swell, concerning whom it is traditionally commented saying: &#x201C;And I will spread dung upon your faces&#x201D; (Mal. 2.3) refers, according to the sages, to those people who eat and drink and act as if determined to make of their lives a continuous feast.<sup><xref rid="fn98">2</xref></sup> And, it is they that say: &#x201C;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we must die&#x201D; (Is. 22.13), which typifies the way wicked people eat, and it is such festive tables which were shamed in the verse saying: &#x201C;For all tables are full of vomit, of filthiness, there is no place clean&#x201D; (Ibid. 28.8). But the wise does not eat save one or two dishes, and of that he eats only enough to sustain his life and is satisfied, which is as Solomon said: &#x201C;The righteous eateth to satisfy his soul&#x201D; (Prov. 13.25).</p>
<p>2. When the wise eats the little that is proper for him, he should not eat it elsewhere than in his own house, at his own table. He should not eat either in a restaurant or on the street, unless because of an extreme need, so that he be not dishonored before people; nor should he eat together with the uncivilized, and indeed, not at those tables which are filled with vomit filthiness; nor should he take his meals too frequent in outside places even in company of the wise.<sup><xref rid="fn99">3</xref></sup> He should not eat at banquets where the gatherings are large. It is improper for him to eat in public, save at a mandatory feast, such as feasts of engagements and weddings, and then only when a disciple of the wise takes to wife the daughter of a disciple of the wise. The righteous and the pious of yore never partook of a meal which was not of their own.<sup><xref rid="fn100">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. When the wise drinks wine he partakes only enough to moisten the food in his bowels; but whosoever intoxicates himself is a sinner, contemptible, and brings about the loss of his wisdom. If he intoxicates himself in the presence of the uncivilized, behold, this one blashphemed the Name. It is forbidden to drink wine at noon, even a small quantity, save it be included in the meal; for, drink which is part of the meal is not intoxicating. However, no warning is needed, save from wine after meals.<sup><xref rid="fn101">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. Though one&#x2019;s wife is ever lawful to him, it is proper that a disciple of the wise should demean himself with sanctity, and not be like a rooster;<sup><xref rid="fn102">6</xref></sup> a Sabbath to Sabbath visitation,<sup><xref rid="fn103">7</xref></sup> if there be no physical reason to the contrary, not in the beginning of the night<sup><xref rid="fn104">8</xref></sup> when in a state of satiety, nor at the end of the night when hungry, but about midnight after the food in his bowels be digested, unaccompanied by either exceeding boisterousness or profanity of mouth with vain words, even between themselves. Behold, it is traditionally said that the Verse, &#x201C;And he declareth unto man what his language is&#x201D; (Amos. 4.13), the sages interpreted: &#x201C;Even on account of indecent conversation a man carries on with his own wife, he will have to render an accounting&#x201D; (Hegigah. 5b). Both of them shall not be intoxicated, nor sluggish, nor in mourning; nor either of them in such state; nor when she be asleep, nor by overpowering her contrary mood; but with the consent and happy mood of both, with few pleasant and light-hearted words to please her being, stilling his urge diffidently and not impudently and dissociate immediately.</p>
<p>5. He who follows such conduct will not only sanctify his soul, and live in a state of purity, and improve his ideas, but if he will father children they will be refined and modest, prepared for wisdom and piety; but he who follows the conduct of the rest of the people who walk in darkness will father children in their likeness.</p>
<p>6. The disciples of the wise conduct themselves with an abundance of privacy. They should not degrade themselves; and they should not uncover their heads and not their bodies. Even when entering a lavatory he should act decently, not to bare himself before sitting down nor use his right hand to dry himself, and remove himself from every human being and use an inner room, or an inner cave, and if it be behind a trench he should distance himself so that his neighbor will not hear him, and if it be on a plain, distance himself so that his neighbor will not see him; and not talk when voiding even if there be great need. And, in the self-same decent manner he follows by day he should follow by night; but one should train himself to have elimination morning and evening, to avoid the need of distancing himself.<sup><xref rid="fn105">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. A disciple of the wise should not be noisy and loud like cattle and animals when talking, nor even raise his voice overmuch, but converse calmly with all people; nevertheless, in speaking calmly he should not overdo it lest he resemble the overpoliteness of the arrogant. He should be first to greet every person, so that their spirit be pleased with him He should judge every person favorably, telling the praiseworthy things about his friend and not at all about the blameworthy things; love peace and pursue it. If he can see his words acceptable he may speak, if not he should be silent. For instance? He should not appease his friend when the latter is moody; nor question him concerning his vow at the time the vow was made, but wait until his friend&#x2019;s mind will be composed and collected; he should not offer condolence while the remains of the deceased are in the presence of his friend, because he is upset until after the remains are buried, and so in other matters of a like delicate nature. He should not call upon his friend while the latter is down through a failing, but keep his eye off of him. He should not change his word, nor add to or diminish from it, unless it be for the sake of peace and similar worthy objects. As a general rule, he should not speak much else save words of wisdom, or charity and the like. He should not carry on a conversation with a woman on the street, even though she be his wife, or his sister, or his daughter.<sup><xref rid="fn106">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. A disciple of the wise shall not walk about with his head high up in the air and neck stretched out, the subject of which was denounced, saying: &#x201C;And they walk with stretched necks and wanton eyes&#x201D; (Is. 3.16); nor overslow as bringing heel to toe like some women and the arrogant, the subject of which was denounced, saying: &#x201C;Walking and measuring as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet&#x201D; (Ibid.); nor run about after the fashion of the mad, nor bent as if hunch-backed, but looking downward as if in praying position, and as if occupied and going on some errand of business. Even from the way a person walks it is apparent whether he is wise and sensible or foolish and imprudent. For even so did Solomon in his wisdom say: &#x201C;Yea also, when a fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool&#x201D; (Ecc. 10.3), meaning that he himself proclaims to everybody that he is a fool.<sup><xref rid="fn107">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. The disciple of the wise should wear becoming and clean clothes, and it is forbidden to have a spot or grease or anything of a like unclean nature, found upon his garment. He should not wear clothes fit for a king such as trimmed with gold or purple which attract everybody&#x2019;s gaze, nor the clothes of a pauper which put the wearer to shame, but average garments of becoming style. He should not wear transparent garments as, for example, garments made of very fine linen which are made in Egypt; nor should they be too long, trailing upon the ground, like the garments of the arrogant, but it may reach to the heel, and the sleeves to his finger-tips. He should not permit to trail his fringed garment, as it appears arrogant, save only on the Sabbath, if he has no other to change. He should not wear patched-up shoes, patch upon a patch, in summer time; but in winter time it is permitted if he be poor. He should not go out on the street perfumed, nor with perfumed garments, nor put perfume in his hair; but if he puts perfume upon his skin to remove perspiration there is no rule forbidding it. Likewise should he not go out alone at night, unless he had set a specified time to go out to his studies. All these ethical rules are so as not to cast any suspicion upon the disciples of the wise.<sup><xref rid="fn108">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. A disciple of the wise adjusts his affairs judiciously: he eats, drinks and supports his family within his capital and material success; but he should not overburden himself more than necessary. The wise men command a worldly custom that a man should not eat meat save when craving it, even as it is said: &#x201C;Because thy soul desireth to eat flesh&#x201D; (Deut. 12.20). It is enough for a healthy person to eat meat from Friday night to Friday night. If, however, he be rich enough to eat meat daily he may eat. The wise men commanded and said: &#x201C;Ever let a man eat less than what his financial means allow, dress within his means, but honor his wife and children with more than his means allow&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn109">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. The way of sensible people: A man should first select a permanent vocation out of which to derive a livelihood, then buy a home, and after that take unto himself a wife, as it is said: &#x201C;And what man is there that built a new house and hath not dedicated it, And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not used the fruit thereof, And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her&#x201D;. (Deut. 20.5&#x2013;7).<sup><xref rid="fn110">14</xref></sup> But fools reverse it by taking a wife first, and after that, if he be able, purchase a home, and after that, in his declining years, he will turn about looking for a vocation, or be supported on charity. Even so is it reversed when pronouncing adversity: &#x201C;Thou shalt betroth a wife, thou shalt build a house, thou shalt plant a vineyard&#x201D; (Deut. 28.30), meaning, thy actions shall be reverse so that thou be unsuccessful in thy ways. But of a blessing it is said: &#x201C;And David acted wisely in all his ways, and the Lord was with him&#x201D; (First Samuel. 18.14).<sup><xref rid="fn111">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. A man is forbidden either to give away or to make holy all of his property and burden society for his support. He should not sell a farm and buy a house, or a house and buy moveables; or engage in merchandise with the proceeds of his house; but he may sell moveables and buy a farm. As a general rule in such matter, he should set his mind to increase his property successfully and exchange the thing which is perishable for the thing which is lasting; he should not direct his intention to find a bit of temporary joy, or enjoy for a while and thereby sustain great loss.<sup><xref rid="fn112">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. The business conduct of the disciple of the wise must be accompanied by truth and good faith; he must say: no, when it is no, and yea, when it is yea; restricting himself in accounting to others, but liberal in giving to and benevolent when receiving from others and place no restrictions upon them; he should make payment immediately after the bargain is made; he should not become surety for others, nor act as trustee, or agent; he should not oblige himself in matters of business in instances where the Torah made it not obligatory upon him, so that he be able to keep his word and not change he obtain judgment by law against others, he should grant them delay, be forgiving to them, aid them with a loan and be gracious to them. He must not go down after the trade of his neighbor, nor ever in his life oppress any one in the world. As a rule he should be among the pursued and not among the pursuers, among the insulted and not among the insulting. For, a man who does all such deeds or their like, of him the Verse says: &#x201C;And He said unto me, &#x2018;thou art My servant, Israel in whom I will be glorified&#x2019;&#x201D; (Is. 49.3).<sup><xref rid="fn113">17</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER VI</h1>
<p>1. It is a natural tendency of man to be influenced in his ideas and conduct by his fellows and associates, and to follow the usage of the people of his state. Because thereof, it is necessary for man to be in the company of the righteous, and to sit near the wise, in order to learn from their conduct, and to distance himself from the evil-doers who follow the path of darkness, in order not to learn from their conduct; for of such Solomon said: &#x201C;He that walketh with wise men shall be wise; but the companion of fools shall smart for it&#x201D; (Prov. 13.20); and it is also said: &#x201C;Happy is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked etc. (Ps. 1.1.). Likewise, if a man be in a state where evil customs prevail and where the people are not following the righteous ways, he should go to a place where the inhabitants are righteous and follow the way of the good. If all the states known to him, or of which intelligence reached him, be followers of a path which is not good, even as it is in our own times, or if he be unable to migrate to a state whose rules of conduct are good, either on account of military operations or on account of sickness, he should isolate himself and live in seclusion, even as it is said on the subject: &#x201C;Let him sit alone and keep silence&#x201D; (Lam. 3.28). And, if the inhabitants of his state be evildoers and sinners, who deny him the right of residence in the state unless he become assimilated with them, and follows their evil conduct, he should go forth and dwell in caves, or cliffs, or deserts, but not accustom himself in the way of the sinners, even as it is said on the subject: &#x201C;Oh that I were in the wilderness,<sup><xref rid="fn114">1</xref></sup> in a lodging place of wayfaring men&#x201D; (Jer. 9.1.).</p>
<p>2. It is a mandatory commandment to cleave to the wise and their disciples, in order to learn of their deeds, even as it is said on the subject: &#x201C;And to Him shalt thou cleave&#x201D; (Deut. 10.20). Is it possible to cleave to the Shekinah? But even thus the wise men commented upon in interpreting this commandment, saying: &#x201C;Cleave to the wise men and their disciples&#x201D; (Ketubot, 111b). Man shall, therefore, find the necessary means to take to wife the daughter of a disciple of the wise, and to give his daughter in marriage to a disciple of the wise; to eat and drink with the disciples of the wise, to do business for and with the disciples of the wise, and to associate with them in every form of companionship, even as it is said, &#x201C;And to cleave to him&#x201D; (Deut. 11.22). Even so have the wise men commanded, saying: &#x201C;Sit amidst the dust of their feet, and drink their words with thirst&#x201D; (Pirke Abot. 1.4.).<sup><xref rid="fn115">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. It is mandatory upon every man to love each and every one of Israel even as he loves his own self, for it is said: &#x201C;But thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself&#x201D; (Lev. 19.19.). One is therefore, obliged to speak in praise of his neighbor, and to be considerate of his money, even as he is considerate of his own money, or desires to preserve his own honor. &#x201C;But whosoever glorifies himself in disgracing his neighbor has no share in the world to come&#x201D; (Yerushalmi, Hegigah. 2.1).<sup><xref rid="fn116">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. The love for the proselyte, who came and embraced the protection beneath the wings of the Shekinah, rests upon two mandatory commandments, one because he is included in the commandment concerning a neighbor, and the other because he is a stranger, and the Torah charged us, saying: &#x201C;Love ye therefore the stranger&#x201D; (Deut. 10.19.). He commanded on the love for the stranger as He commanded concerning the love for Himself, saying: &#x201C;And thou shalt love the Lord thy God&#x201D; (Ibid. 6.5.). The Holy One, blessed is He! loves the strangers Himself, even as it is said: &#x201C;And (He) loveth the stranger&#x201D; (Ibid. 10.18).<sup><xref rid="fn117">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. Whosoever hates any one of Israel within his heart, violates a prohibitive commandment, even as it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart&#x201D; (Lev. 19.17.); but the punishment of flogging is not pronounced for violating this prohibitive commandment, as no act was committed, for, the Torah did not admonish save by hatred within the heart. Moreover, he who smites his fellow, or besmirches him with words, although forbidden to do so, there is no violation of the prohibitive commandment of &#x201C;Thou shalt not hate&#x201D; connected thereto.<sup><xref rid="fn118">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. If one man commit a sin against another man, the one sinned against shall not remain in silent hate against the sinner, as it is said of the wicked: &#x201C;And Absalom spoke unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon&#x201D; (Second Samuel. 13.22); but, on the contrary, it is obligatory upon him to make known to him and say unto him: &#x201C;Why have you done to me thus and such, and wherefore have you sinned against me in that particular matter?&#x201D;; for, it is said: &#x201C;And thou shalt indeed rebuke thy neighbor&#x201D; (Lev. 19.17). And, if the sinner did repent and begged to be forgiven by him, he must forgive him; and in doing so he should not be cruel, for it is said: &#x201C;And Abraham prayed unto God&#x201D; (Gen. 20.17).<sup><xref rid="fn119">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. He who beholds his fellow stooping to sin or following an unrighteous path, is obliged to return him toward the good, and to let him know that he is actually sinning against himself in pursuing wicked deeds for, it is said: &#x201C;And thou shalt indeed rebuke thy neighbor&#x201D; (Lev. 19.17). He who rebukes his fellow, whether it be regarding a sin committed between man and man, or whether it be regarding matters between man and God, it is essential that the rebuke be administered only between them both; and he shall speak to him calmly, employing soft language, telling him that he does not speak of it to him, save for his own good, to bring him to a life in the world to come. If he receive it attentively from him, it is well; if not, he should rebuke him a second, even a third time. So is the constant duty of a man to continue to rebuke his fellow, even until the sinner strike him, and say unto him: &#x201C;I will not listen&#x201D;. He in whose power it is to prevent sin and does not take the means to prevent it, he himself is ultimately overtaken by their sin, since it was possible for him to prevent them.<sup><xref rid="fn120">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. He who rebukes a friend, at the beginning, no hard words should be used against him to shame him, for it is said: &#x201C;And thou shalt bear no sin upon him&#x201D; (Lev. 19.17). Thus did the wise men say: &#x201C;Understand it not by rebuking him thou mayest cause his countenance to change expression; for, it is said: &#x2018;And thou shalt bear no sin upon him&#x2019;&#x201D; (Ibid.; Arakin, 16b); herefrom we learn that it is forbidden to put an Israelite to shame, needless to say publicly. Although he who does put his fellow to shame is not flogged, it is a grievous sin. Even so did the wise men say: &#x201C;He who publicly puts his fellow&#x2019;s countenance to shame has no share in the world to come&#x201D; (Pirke Abot, 3.15). A man is, therefore obliged to guard himself against putting his fellow to shame publicly, regardless of whether he be young or old; not to call him by a name of which he feels ashamed, nor tell aught in his presence of which he is ashamed. However, all these refer to matters touching the relationship between man and man; but if it concern heavenly matters, if the sinner does not repent after being rebuked privately, he should be shamed publicly, and his sin should be proclaimed, and harsh words should be used in his presence, and he should be shamed and cursed till he repent and take up the good path, even as all of the prophets in Israel did with the wicked.<sup><xref rid="fn121">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. He against whom a fellow sinned, who did not want to rebuke him, nor to speak aught to him, because the sinner is extremely common, or possessed of a distorted mind, but within his heart forgave him, and lodged no hatred against him, though he rebuked him not, behold, such is a pious conduct for, the Torah did not concern itself with aught save against hatred.<sup><xref rid="fn122">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. A man is obliged to watch out for orphans and widows, for their soul is very lowly, and their spirit humble even though they be wealthy in money, even though they be the widow and orphans of a king, we are charged concerning them, for it is said: &#x201C;Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child&#x201D; (Ex. 22.22.). What, then, are the rules of conduct toward them? One must not speak to them save in soft words; not to treat them in any way, save in an honorable way; not to pain their body with labor, nor their heart with hard words; to be careful with their money more than with the money of one&#x2019;s own self. He who worries them, or vexes them, or pains them, or masters them, or causes the loss of their money, violates a prohibitive commandment, needless to mention one who smites them or curses them. This prohibitive commandment, notwithstanding that the punishment of flogging is not inflicted for its violation, behold, the punishment therefor is plainly stated in the Torah: &#x201C;My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword&#x201D; (Ibid. 22.23). Moreover, He Who spoke and called the universe into being, made a covenant with them, that whenever they will cry out against violence, they shall be answered, even as it is said: &#x201C;For if they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry&#x201D; (Ibid. 22.22). But all these warnings are applicable when one afflicts them out of a selfish motive; but if the master who, in order to instruct them in the Torah, or teach them a trade, or lead them in a righteous path, does inflict punishment upon them when they are contrary, behold, such he may do. Nevertheless, he should not follow the rules of other people in dealing with them but conduct himself toward them differently, to lead them slowly, with great mercy and honorable consideration, even as it is said: &#x201C;For the Lord will plead their cause&#x201D; (Prov. 22.23). Whether it be a fatherless orphan or a motherless orphan, the treatment to be accorded to them must be identical. Now, until when are such called orphans for the purpose of the subject treated herein? Until they will have no need to lean upon a grown-up person to rear them and support them, but each one be able to take care of all his personal needs even as all other adults do.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VII.</h1>
<p>1. He who bears tales against his fellow violates a prohibitive commandment, saying: &#x201C;Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people&#x201D; (Lev. 19.16.); and although the punishment of flogging is not inflicted for violating this charge, it is a gross iniquity, and is the cause of the slaughtering of many souls in Israel; it is because thereof, that following this commandment is this Verse: &#x201C;Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbor&#x201D; (Ibid.). Now, go ye and learn of that which happened to Doeg the Edomite.<sup><xref rid="fn123">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Who is a sycophant? One who loads himself up with matters, and goes from this one to that one, saying to each, such did that man say, thus and such have I heard concerning that man, even though it be true, behold him, he destroys the universe. There is yet an extremely grosser iniquity, which, too, is included in this prohibitive commandment, and that is, the evil tongue, one who spreads scandal about his fellow even though he be telling truth. If he be lying, he is called a maligner who invents an evil name against his fellow. The owner of an evil tongue<sup><xref rid="fn124">2</xref></sup>, behold him, he sits in company and relates, saying: thus and such did that certain party, thus and such were his parents, and thus and such I did hear about him and of course, he relates scandalous matters. Of him, the Verse says: &#x201C;May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaketh proud things&#x201D; (Ps. 12.4).</p>
<p>3. The wise men said: &#x201C;There are three transgresssions which call forth retribution from the man who perpetrates in this world, and disinherit him from a share in the world to come. They are: idolatry, adultery, and bloodshed; but the evil tongue outweighs them all&#x201D; (Arakin, 16b). The wise men, moreover, said:<sup><xref rid="fn125">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;He who speaks with an evil tongue is like an atheist, for it is said: &#x2018;Who have said, Our tongues will we make mighty, our lips are with us, who is Lord over us&#x2019;&#x201D;? (Ps. 12.5.). And, again, the wise men said: &#x201C;The evil tongue kills three persons, the one who speaks it, the one of whom it is spoken, and the one who receives it&#x201D;. In fact, the greatest harm comes to the one who receives the evil report.<sup><xref rid="fn126">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. And, there are certain kinds of words which are the grinding of the evil tongue. For example: One will say, &#x201C;Who will tell that person to be as he is now&#x201D;? Or he will say: &#x201C;Hold your peace concerning that person, I am disinclined to relate what happened, or what was&#x201D;, or like such expressions. Even he who tells the good qualities of his fellow in the presence of his fellow&#x2019;s enemies is making grinding of an evil tongue, because he calls forth his fellow&#x2019;s shame from the mouths of his enemies and concerning this subject Solomon said: &#x201C;He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him&#x201D; (Prov. 27.14). Out of his goodness for him, he brings about evil to him. Likewise, he who tells with an evil tongue under the guise of a joke, or lightheadedness, that is, he does not speak it in tones of hatred, even of him Solomon in his wisdom said: &#x201C;As a madman who casteth firebrands, arrows and death; so is the man that deceiveth his neighbor and saith, &#x2018;Am not I in sport?&#x2019;&#x201D; (Ibid .26 18&#x2013;19.). Among such is also the one who uses an evil tongue deceitfully, relating innocently, as if ignorant that his speech be words of an evil tongue, but when there is a protest against what he says, he avers that he does not know that such tale is evil speech, or that such was really the conduct of that person.<sup><xref rid="fn127">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. Regardless of whether the slander is spoken in the presence of his fellow, or in his absence, or if the slander spread from mouth to mouth cause harm to his fellow, to his body, or property, even to cause him anguish, or fear to his soul, behold this is the iniquity of an evil tongue. If such evil be spoken in the presence of three persons, the matter is thereby considered public. Thus, if one of the three who heard it repeat it to others no sin of an evil tongue is found therein, provided that in re-telling it he had no intention to spread the rumor and advertise it still more.<sup><xref rid="fn128">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. All such are owners of an evil tongue, in whose neighborhood it is forbidden to dwell, needless to say to be in their company and listen to their words. The doom against our fathers in the wilderness was not sealed for aught else, save for that of an evil tongue.<sup><xref rid="fn129">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. He who takes vengeance of his fellow violates the prohibitive commandment of, &#x201C;Thou shalt not take vengeance&#x201D; (Lev. 19.18.); and, even though he is not flogged for the violation, it is an extremely evil tendency. Forsooth, it becomes man to be indulgent in his ethical conduct in all temporal matters, for, to those who can reason all worldly matters are vanity and absurdity, unworthy to call forth vengeance on their account. How is the sin of taking vengeance established? Said his friend to him: &#x201C;Lend me your ax&#x201D;. Answered he: &#x201C;No, I will not lend it to you.&#x201D; On the morrow, he needs to borrow an ax himself. Says he to his friend: &#x201C;Lend me your ax.&#x201D; Answered his friend: &#x201C;No, I will not lend it to you, even as you refused to lend it to me when I asked for it.&#x201D; Behold, this one takes vengeance. For when one comes to lend aught of the other, he should give it to him whole-heartedly, and not to deal with him as he was dealt with by him. And so in all like matters. Even so David expressed it in his good ethical ideas: &#x201C;If I have requited him that did evil unto me, or spoiled mine adversary unto emptiness etc.&#x201D; (Ps. 7.5).<sup><xref rid="fn130">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. Likewise, whoso bears a grudge against one in Israel, violates a prohibitive commandment, saying: &#x201C;Nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people&#x201D; (Lev. 19.18.). How is the sin of bearing a grudge established? Said Reuben to Simeon: &#x201C;Lease me this house, or lend me this ox.&#x201D; Simeon refused. After an interval comes Simeon to Reuben to lease or lend aught from him. Said Reuben to him: &#x201C;Here, you may have it, behold, I am lending it to you, for I am not as you are, I will not pay you as you deserve.&#x201D; He who does so violates the prohibitive commandment of, &#x201C;Thou shalt bear no grudge.&#x201D; For, he should blot the thing out of his heart completely, and not lodge it therein. Forsooth, as long as he bears the matter and remembers it, he might be tempted to take vengeance. It is on account of this that the Torah is particular concerning the bearing of a grudge to blot such sin out of his heart and not remember it at all. This, is the proper ethical idea which makes possible the stability of organized society and the business relationship between man and man upon earth.<sup><xref rid="fn131">10</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>THE TREATISE CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH</title>
<p>Embraces two mandatory commandments, namely: (1) To study the Torah; (2) To honor those who study it and those who know it. And the interpretation of these two commandments is given in the succeeding chapters.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<p>1. Women, slaves, and infants are absolved from the study of the Torah; but the father is obliged to instruct his infant son in the Torah, for it is said: &#x201C;And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them&#x201D; (Deut. 11.19); but a woman is not charged to teach her son, for only one obliged to study is obliged to instruct.<sup><xref rid="fn132">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Even as man is obliged to instruct his son, so is he obliged to teach his son&#x2019;s son, for it is said: &#x201C;But make them known to thy sons and thy sons&#x2019; sons&#x201D; (Ibid. 4.9); and, not alone to his son and his son&#x2019;s son, but each and every scholar in Israel is commanded to instruct all who desire to be his disciples, even though they be not his sons, for it is said: &#x201C;And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children&#x201D; (Ibid. 6.7.), which is traditionally interpreted<sup><xref rid="fn133">2</xref></sup> to include one&#x2019;s disciples; for disciples, too, are called children, as it is said: &#x201C;And the sons of the prophets came forth&#x201D; (Second Kings, 2.3.). If it be so, why then was one commanded to teach his son and his son&#x2019;s son? To permit the precedence of one&#x2019;s son to one&#x2019;s son&#x2019;s son, and his son&#x2019;s son to the son of his fellow.<sup><xref rid="fn134">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. One is obliged to engage a teacher for the instruction of his son; but his fellow&#x2019;s son he is not obliged to teach, save when there is no expense to himself.<sup><xref rid="fn135">4</xref></sup> He whose father failed to instruct him, when he becomes conscious thereof, is obliged to educate himself, as it is said: &#x201C;That ye may learn them, and observe to do them&#x201D; (Deut. 5.1). Thus, you will find it a universal rule, that study precedes conduct, because study brings about proper conduct but conduct does not bring about study.<sup><xref rid="fn136">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. One who was ambitious to pursue learning, and, at the same time, has a son whom he is obliged to instruct, his own study comes first; if his son be diligent and intellectually more capable to grasp his studies than himself, his son comes first. Nevertheless, he shall not completely abandon his own study, his son&#x2019;s precedence notwithstanding; for, even as he is commanded to teach his son, so is he under command to study himself.<sup><xref rid="fn137">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. Let man ever study the Torah and thereafter take a wife unto himself; for, if he takes a wife first, his mind will not be as clear to study. If the urge of marriage will over-burden him, even finding his heart not free to understand his studies, he should marry first and thereafter study the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn138">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. Whenceonward is his father obliged to teach him the Torah? When he commences to speak, he should teach him the Verses of, &#x201C;Moses commanded us a law&#x201D; (Deut. 34.4), and of the Shema (Ibid. 6.4); thereafter he imparts to him little by little other Verses till he be six or seven years old, all, of course, depending upon his physical condition; thereafter he brings him under the care of a beginner&#x2019;s instructor.<sup><xref rid="fn139">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. Where the custom of the state is to pay a beginner&#x2019;s teacher, he should give him his wages, and the obligation to pay for his son&#x2019;s education continues until he is through reading all of the Holy Writ. In a place where the prevailing custom is to teach the written Torah for pay, one may instruct for pay; but to instruct the Oral Torah for wages, is forbidden, as it is said: &#x201C;Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as the Lord my God commanded me, etc.&#x201D; (Deut. 4.5.), which means; &#x201C;Even as I was instructed free so have you received instruction from me free; likewise when you will give instruction throughout the generations, instruct free even as you were instructed by me.&#x201D; (Nedarim, 37a; Bekorot, 29a). If he find not one who is so willing to teach him gratuitously, he may hire one for wages to be instructed by him, as it says: &#x201C;Buy the truth&#x201D; (Prov. 23.23.) Peradventure, one will deduct herefrom that he may instruct others for wages? The Verse, therefore, teaches us, saying: &#x201C;But sell it not&#x201D; (Ibid.) Herefrom you learn that one is forbidden to instruct others for hire although his master taught him for hire.</p>
<p>8. Every man in Israel is obliged to study the Torah, whether he be poor or rich, whether he be physically healthy or ailing, whether he be in full vigor of youth or of great age and weakened vitality; even if he be dependent upon alms for his livelihood, or going around from door to door begging his daily bread, yea, even he who has a wife and children to support is obliged to have an appointed time for the study of the Torah, both during the day and at night, for it is said: &#x201C;But thou shalt meditate therein day and night&#x201D; (Joshua, 1.8.).<sup><xref rid="fn140">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. Some of the great scholars in Israel were hewers of wood, some of them drawers of water, and some of them blind: nevertheless they engaged themselves in the study of the Torah by day and by night. Moreover, they are included among those who translated the tradition as it was transmitted from mouth of man to mouth of man, even from the mouth of Moses our Master.</p>
<p>10. Until what age in life is one obliged to study the Torah? Even until the day of one&#x2019;s demise; for it is said: &#x201C;And lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life&#x201D; (Deut. 4.9.) Forsooth, as long as one will not occupy himself with study he forgets what he did study.<sup><xref rid="fn141">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. One is obligated to divide his time of study by three; one third for the study of Holy Writ, one third for the study of the Oral Torah, and one third for thinking and reflecting so that he may understand the end of a thing from its beginning, and deduct one matter from another, and compare one matter to another, and reason out by the hermeneutical rules in which the Torah is expounded to the end that he may know which are the principal rules and how to deduct therefrom that which is forbidden and that which is permitted, and other like matters which he studied from oral tradition. This subject of study is called Gemara.<sup><xref rid="fn142">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. For instance? If one was a craftsman and engaged himself three hours daily to his work and to Torah nine hours, of those nine hours he should devote three hours to the study of Holy Writ, and three hours to the Oral Torah and the last three hours to mental reasoning, to deduct one matter from another. Matters pertaining to tradition are included in Holy Writ, but their oral explanation is included in Oral Torah. The subjects designated as Pardas<sup><xref rid="fn143">12</xref></sup> are included in the Gemara. These rules are spoken of man&#x2019;s beginning of study, but when he matures in wisdom and has no need either for further study of Holy Writ or for continuous devotion to the study of Oral Torah, he should read Holy Writ and traditional matters at appointed times merely so as not to forget any matter pertaining to the laws of the Torah, and turn his attention to a continuous study of Gemara, of course, in proportion to the broadness of his heart and peacefulness of his mind.<sup><xref rid="fn144">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. A woman who studied the Torah has a reward coming to her but it is incomparable to the reward of a man because she was not commanded to do so, and whosoever does something which is not mandatory upon him to perform receives not a hire equal to the hire of him who is commanded to perform it but less than he. And, although she has a reward coming the sages commanded that a man shall not instruct his daughter in the Torah, because most women have no set mind to be instructed therein, but, on the contrary, are apt to divert matters of the Torah to nonsensical matters, of course, in proportion to the inferiority of their mind. The sages said: &#x201C;Whosoever instructs his daughter in Torah does no better than if he instructed her in matters of profanity.&#x201D; (Sotah, 21b). These matters are thus spoken of only concerning the Oral Torah, but respecting Holy Writ it is best not to begin to instruct her therein but if he did instruct her it is not as if he instruct her in profanity.<sup><xref rid="fn145">14</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER II</h1>
<p>1. It is mandatory to appoint school teachers for small children in each and every state, in each and every province, and in each and every city. Any city wherein there are no children flocking to a master&#x2019;s house, the inhabitants thereof should be excommunicated until they do appoint teachers for the school children, if they then make no such appointment an excommunication should be pronounced against the city itself; for the world cannot endure save only by the fervent recitation of school children in the house of their master.<sup><xref rid="fn146">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Children should be enrolled for instruction at the age of six or seven years, in proportion to the strength of the child and his physique. A child under six years should not be sent to school. The teacher may inflict punishment upon the school children that they may fear him; but he must not smite them with hatred and cruelty; he should, therefore, not strike them with rods or sticks but with a small strap. He should instruct them during the entire day and part of the evening, so that they be brought up to study by day and by night. Children should not stop school at all save on the eves of Sabbaths and holidays, and during holidays. On the Sabbath no new lessons should be given but lessons may be repeated. School children should not be rendered idle even for the sake of building the Holy Temple.<sup><xref rid="fn147">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. A teacher of school children who leaves the children and departs from the school, or who engages himself in another kind of work while he is with them, or who is negligent in teaching them, behold, he is included among those of whom it is said: &#x201C;Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord with a slack hand&#x201D; (Jer. 48.10). It is, therefore, improper to appoint any teacher save one who is God fearing, diligent in reading and grammar.<sup><xref rid="fn148">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. He who has no wife shall not instruct small children on account of the mothers who come to visit their children; and a woman shall not instruct small children on account of the fathers who come to visit their children.<sup><xref rid="fn149">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. Twenty-five children should be the maximum number for one teacher to instruct. If there be more than twenty-five children but not exceeding forty, an assistant should be appointed to help him in giving them instructions; if the number exceeds forty children, two teachers should be appointed.<sup><xref rid="fn150">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. A school child may be transferred from one teacher to another one who is more diligent than he either in reading or in grammar. This rule is given when both teachers live in one city and there was no river between them, but from one city to another or from one side of the river to the other even in the same city, a child should not be transferred save where there was a strong bridge constructed across the river, a bridge which will not easily topple over</p>
<p>7. One of a given neighborhood who desires to become a teacher, even one sharing a common courtyard with others, cannot be prevented by neighbors from doing so; likewise, if a teacher comes and establishes a school to instruct small children alongside the school of another teacher, whether his intentions are to get pupils from others, or whether his intentions are to get pupils from that very school, such teacher cannot prevent him from opening such a school, for it is said: &#x201C;The Lord was pleased for his righteousness&#x2019; sake, to make the Torah great and glorious&#x201D; (Is. 42.21).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER III</h1>
<p>1. The people of Israel were crowned with three crowns: the crown of Torah, the crown of priesthood and the crown of sovereignty. The crown of priesthood was acquired by Aaron, even as it is said: &#x201C;And it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of everlasting priesthood&#x201D; (Num. 25.13); the crown of sovereignty was acquired by David, even as it is said: &#x201C;His seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before Me&#x201D; (Psalms 89.37); but the crown of the Torah, behold it, there it lies ready within the grasp of all Israel, even as it is said: &#x201C;Moses commanded us a Law, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob&#x201D; (Deut. 33.4), Whosoever wants it may come and take it. Peradventure, you will say that those other two crowns are greater than the crown of the Torah, behold, it is said: &#x201C;By Me kings reign, and princes decree justice; by Me princes rule&#x201D; (Prov. 8. 13&#x2013;14), herefrom be instructed that the crown of the Torah is greater than both of the others.<sup><xref rid="fn151">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. The sages said: &#x201C;One born out of wedlock if he be a scholar, takes precedence over an ignorant high priest&#x201D; (Horayot, 13b); even as it is said: &#x201C;She is more precious than rubies&#x201D; (Prov. 3.15),<sup><xref rid="fn152">2</xref></sup> meaning, more precious than a high priest who enters the innermost place of the Temple.</p>
<p>3. You have not a single commandment among all the precepts to balance the one concerning the study of the Torah, but the precept to study the Torah stands out against all the rest of the commandments, because study leads to practice. Therefore, in every instance study precedes practice.<sup><xref rid="fn153">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. One confronted with both the performance of a commandment and the study of the Torah, if the commandment can be performed by proxy he should not interrupt his study; if not, he should perform the commandment and go back to his study.<sup><xref rid="fn154">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. The judgment of man in the world to come commences with no other than the question of the study of the Torah, whereafter concerning the rest of his deeds.<sup><xref rid="fn155">7</xref></sup> Therefore the wise men said: &#x201C;Let man ever pursue the study of the Torah, whether for its own divine purpose, or not for its own divine purpose, because studying it for non-divine purpose he will attain its own divine purpose.&#x201D; (Pesahim, 50b; Sotah, 22a; Nazir, 23b).</p>
<p>6. Whosoever is ambitious to establish this commandment properly and to become adorned with the crown of the Torah must not divert his thoughts to other matters, nor set his heart to acquire the knowledge of the Torah and wealth and honor simultaneously. The way leading to the knowledge of the Torah is such: &#x201C;a morsel of bread with salt thou shalt eat, and water by measure thou shalt drink, upon the ground thou shalt sleep, and a burdensome life thou shalt live while thou toilest in the Torah.&#x201D; (Pirke Abot, 6.4; 21). Nevertheless, it is not obligatory upon thee to complete it, nor art thou free to exclude thyself from its study, for if thou hast increased thy study of the Torah thou also hast increased thy reward, as the reward is equal to the pain.</p>
<p>7. Peradventure, one will say, I will interrupt my study of the Torah until I will accumulate wealth when I will again return to it, or until I will acquire sufficient substance to supply all my needs when I will retire and return back to it; if such a thought will penetrate thy heart you will never acquire the crown of the Torah. But make thy study of the Torah paramount and thy secular work incidental, and do not say, when I will be unoccupied then I will study, lest you will never be unoccupied.<sup><xref rid="fn156">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. Holy Writ says: &#x201C;It is not in heaven &#x2026; neither is it beyond the sea&#x201D; (Deut. 30.12&#x2013;13) it is not in heaven, that is to say, the Torah is not found among the arrogant nor is it found among the travelers beyond the sea.&#x201D; (Erubin, 55a). The sages, therefore said: &#x201C;Not he who engages himself over-much in commerce is wise.&#x201D; (Pirke Abot, 2.6). The sages, moreover, commanded: &#x201C;Engage thyself but little in worldly pursuits and pursue the study of the Torah&#x201D; (Pirke Abot, 4.12).</p>
<p>9. The words of the Torah are likened unto water, even as it is said: &#x201C;Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye for water&#x201D; (Is. 55.1), which is to teach you, even as waters do not gather in steep places, but flow by gravity and gather in a well, so are the words of the Torah, they are not found among the high spirited nor in the heart of all haughty but in the humble and meek spirited who embraces the dust of the feet of the wise and removes the passions and the pleasures of the age from his heart and does a little work daily for his living, if he happens to be unprovided with food, and the rest of his days and his nights he pursues the study of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn157">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. Nevertheless, whosoever sets his heart to pursue the study of the Torah but do no secular work at all, and permits himself to be supported by charity, behold him, he blasphemed the Name, and degraded the Torah, and shadowed the light of religion, and caused evil to be brought upon himself, and deprived his own life from its share in the world to come; because it is forbidden to enjoy aught in this world in return of the study of the words of the Torah. The sages said: &#x201C;Whosoever enjoys aught in return of the study of the words of the Torah takes his own life away from the world&#x201D; (Pirke Abot, 4.7). They have, moreover, commanded and said: &#x201C;Thou shalt not make them a garland by which to be considered great nor a spade to dig with them&#x201D; (Ibid.). Again they have commanded and said: &#x201C;Love manual labor and hate rank&#x201D;. (Pirke Abot, 1.10); whosoever studies the Torah and does not acquire at the same time a manual trade his knowledge of the Torah will be nullified and bring about sin&#x201D; (Ibid. 2.2.). The end of this will be that he will rob people for his living.<sup><xref rid="fn158">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. He who supports himself by the labor of his own hands attains a high degree. It is an ethical conduct of the pious man of yore. Therewith one acquires all honor and good that is in this world and in the world to come, even as it is said: &#x201C;When thou eatest the labor of thy hands happy shalt thou be and the good shall be with thee&#x201D; (Ps. 1.28); happy shalt thou be in this world, and the good shall be with thee in the world to come, which is entirely good.<sup><xref rid="fn159">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. The words of the Torah do not remain permanently with one who is indolent in acquiring them, nor with such who study the Torah in an environment of luxury and amidst eating and drinking, but with one who sacrifices his life for them and constantly suffers his body and does not yield sleep to his eyes nor dozing to his eyelids. Said the wise men symbolically: &#x201C;This is the Law, when a man dieth in a tent&#x201D; (Num. 19.14); the Torah does not remain with any save with him who sacrifices his life in the tents of the wise. And so did Solomon in his wisdom say: &#x201C;If thou fall in the day of adversity thy strength is small indeed&#x201D; (Prov. 24.10); and he, moreover, said: &#x201C;Also my wisdom stood me in stead<sup><xref rid="fn160">12</xref></sup> (Ecc. 2.9); only the wisdom which I studied in trouble stood me in stead&#x201D; (Shabbat, 83a). The sages said: &#x201C;There is an established covenant that he who endures hardship in studying the Torah in the Beth Hamedrash will not easily forget it; but he who endures the hardship of his studies privately by himself becomes wise, even as it is said: &#x201C;But with the lowly is wisdom&#x201D; (Prov. 11.2). He who during his study reads the words audibly, his study remains with him; but he who whispers out his words speedily forgets them.<sup><xref rid="fn161">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. Although it is mandatory to study by day and by night, no man acquires most of his wisdom at any but during night-time. Therefore, whosoever desires to attain the crown of the Torah should take care of all of his nights, not to spend even one of them in sleeping, eating, drinking, conversation, or in like matters, but in study of the Torah and in matters of wisdom. The sages said: &#x201C;The voice of the Torah cannot be heard save at night, as it is said &#x2018;Arise and speak loud in the night&#x2019;&#x201D; (Midrash Raba, Song of Songs, 5.11; Erubin, 65a; Lam. 2.19. Whosoever pursues the study of the Torah by night has a thread of God&#x2019;s lovingkindness drawn upon himself by day, as it is said: &#x201C;By day the Lord will command His lovingkindness and in the night His song shall be with a prayer unto the God of my life&#x201D; (Abodah Zarah, 3b; Ps. 42.9). Any house wherein the words of the Torah are not heard by night, fire consumes it, even as it is said: &#x201C;All darkness is laid up for his treasures, a fire not blown by man shall consume him&#x201D; (Sanhedrin, 92; Job. 20. 26). &#x201C;Because he had despised the word of the Lord, is one who hath not at all observed the words of the Torah&#x201D; (Num. 15. 31; Sanhedrin, 99a). Likewise, he who has the means to pursue the Torah and does not pursue it, or he who studied and became proficient in the Torah but separated himself from it for the sake of the vanities of the world and abandoned his studies and deserted them is included among those who &#x201C;had despised the word of the Lord.&#x201D; The sages said: &#x201C;he who abandons the Torah because of wealth will end up by abandoning it because of poverty, but whosoever continues to study the Torah in poverty will in the end continue its study in wealth&#x201D; (Pirke Abot, 4.11.). This subject is, moreover, defined in the Torah, for, it says: &#x201C;Because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joyfulness and with greatness of heart by reason of the abundance of all things: therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy&#x201D; (Deut. 28.47&#x2013;48); and it is furthermore said: &#x201C;That He might afflict thee to do thee good at thy latter end&#x201D; (Deut. 8.16).<sup><xref rid="fn162">14</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER IV</h1>
<p>1. No instructions in the Torah should be given to any but a fit student of proper conduct, or to one indifferently known; but if one followed a way which is not good, we first must bring him back to goodness and lead him in the path of righteousness and scrutinize him, after which we may admit him to the Beth Hamedrash and give him instructions. The sages said: &#x201C;He who instructs an unfit disciple is likened unto one who serves Mercury by casting a stone upon him, as it is said: &#x201C;As a small stone in a heap of stones, so is he that giveth honor to a fool&#x2019;&#x201D; (Prov. 26.8; Hullin, 133a). There is no honor save in the Torah as it is said: &#x201C;The wise shall inherit honor&#x201D; (Prov. 3.35). Likewise, a Rabbi who does not follow the good way, though he be a great scholar and all of the people stand in need of him no instruction should be received from him until his return to goodness, as it is said: &#x201C;For the priests&#x2019; lips should keep knowledge and they should seek the Law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts&#x201D; (Mal. 2.7). Thereupon the sages said: &#x201C;If the Rabbi be like unto the messenger of the Lord of Hosts then shall they seek the Law at his mouth, if not, they shall not seek the Law at his mouth.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn163">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. In what manner should instruction be given? The master sits at the head and the disciples sit in a garland shaped semi-circle before him so that all can see the master and hear his words. The master shall not sit on a chair and his disciples on the ground, but they should sit either all on the ground or all on chairs. In the days of yore the custom was for the master to sit and the disciples to stand during instructions, but before the destruction of the Second Temple, the universal rule was inaugurated to instruct with the disciples sitting.<sup><xref rid="fn164">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. If the master instructs the disciples personally he should give the instructions direct, but if he instructs through an interpreter, the interpreter stands between him and the disciples, then the master speaks to the interpreter and the interpreter in turn, recites the lessons to all the disciples. When the disciples ask questions, they ask of the interpreter, he repeats the question to the master, the master answers the interpreter, and the interpreter answers the questioner. The master shall not raise his voice above the voice of the interpreter, nor shall the interpreter raise his voice when he repeats the question to the master, above the master&#x2019;s voice. <sup><xref rid="fn165">3</xref></sup>The interpreter is not permitted to diminish from or add to, or change, aught in the master&#x2019;s lesson unless the interpreter be either the father of the master, or the master&#x2019;s master. The master says to the interpreter: &#x201C;so was I instructed by my master or so was I instructed by the master, my father,&#x201D; and when the interpreter repeats these words to the audience, he speaks in the name of the master and mentions the name of the master&#x2019;s father or of the master&#x2019;s master, and he says, &#x201C;thus was said by the master named so and so&#x201D;, although the master himself did not pronounce the name of the master of whom he heard it, as it is forbidden to call by name either one&#x2019;s master or one&#x2019;s father.<sup><xref rid="fn166">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. When a master gave a lesson which the disciples did not understand, he should not get angry at them and be moody, but go over it again and repeat it even many times, until they will understand the depth of the treatise. Likewise, a disciple shall not say, I understood, and he did not understand; but he should repeat and ask even many times. If the master angers at him and becomes moody, he may say to him: &#x201C;Master, it is Torah, and I need instruction, but my mind is short of understanding&#x201D;!<sup><xref rid="fn167">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. A disciple shall not feel ashamed before his fellows who mastered the subject the first or the second time, whereas he did not grasp it until after hearing it many times, for if he will be ashamed of such a thing, he will find himself coming in and going out of the Beth Hamedrash without any instructions at all. The sages, therefore, said: &#x201C;He who is bashful cannot be instructed and he who is in an angry mood cannot instruct.&#x201D; (Pirke Abot, 2.6). Whereof are such things said? In instances when the disciples did not understand a subject because of its depth or because their mind is short; but if it appears to the master that they are indolent to study the words of the Torah, and sluggish in acquiring them, because of which they did not understand, he is obliged to rebuke them and shame them with words in order to make them energetic. And on this subject the sages said: &#x201C;Cast gall amongst the disciples.&#x201D; (Ketubot, 103b). It is, therefore, unbecoming for a master to conduct himself light-headedly in the presence of the disciples, not to amuse himself in their presence, nor eat or drink with them, so that they will stand in awe before him and receive instructions from him diligently.<sup><xref rid="fn168">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. The master should not be asked any question upon his arrival in the lecture room, not until his mind will be tranquil; nor should a disciple commence to ask questions as soon as he comes in, not until he will be rested and his thoughts composed. Two students should ask no question simultaneously. No question on a different subject should be asked of a master, but limit it to the subject under discussion, so that he be not put to shame. The master may circumvent his questions of the students and his demeaner when in their presence in order to test and energize them, and to know whether they remember what they have learned or whether they do not remember it. Needless to say that he has authority to ask them questions regarding other subjects which are not under discussion so as to have them take care of all their lessons.<sup><xref rid="fn169">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. No question should be asked standing and no replies given standing; not from a higher place and not from a distance and not from behind the elders. No questions should be asked of the master save on the subject of the lesson then being recited, and the questioning should not be in any but in a profound mood, and each student should not ask more than three questions on a given subject.<sup><xref rid="fn170">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. Concerning two who ask questions. One asked on the subject and the other asked not on the subject, attention should be paid to the subject; about a rule of practice and about a matter not touching practice, attention should be paid to practice; law and homiletics, attention should be paid to law; homiletics and legend, attention should be paid to homiletics; legend and inference from minor to major, attention should be paid to minor and major; inference from minor to major and inference from a similarity of phrases, attention should be paid to the inference from minor to major. If, of the two questioners, one was a master and the other a student, attention should be paid to the master; a student and an ignoramous, attention should be paid to the student; if both were masters, or both students, or both ignoramouses, or both ask two treatises, or two responses, or two questions concerning two rules of practice, the interpreter has discretionary powers under such circumstances.</p>
<p>9. It is not permitted to sleep in the Beth Hamedrash, and whosoever drowses in the Beth Hamedrash, his wisdom becomes torn rags; for even so Solomon in his wisdom said: &#x201C;And drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags&#x201D; (Prov. 23. 21). No conversation is permitted in the Beth Hamedrash save in words of Torah. Even one who sneezed, it is not said to him: &#x201C;May it be a cure to you,&#x201D; in the Beth Hamedrash; needless to mention other kind of conversation. The sacredness of the Beth Hamedrash is of greater force than the sacredness of synagogues.<sup><xref rid="fn171">9</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER V</h1>
<p>1. Even as a man is under command to honor his father and fear him, so is he obliged to honor his master, but fear him yet more than his father; his father brought him to life upon this world but his master who taught him wisdom, brings him to life in the world to come. If he chances upon a lost article of his father and a lost article of his master, reclaiming that of his master precedes the one of his father. If his father and his master are burdened with a load, he should unburden the load of his master first and then that of his father. If his father and his master be incarcerated in a prison, he should free the master first and afterward free his father. If his father was a disciple of the wise, he should free his father first. Likewise if his father be a disciple of the wise, even though not weighty alongside his master, he should reclaim the lost article of his father first and after that reclaim the lost article of his master. There is no honor greater than the honor due a master, nor awe greater than the awe due a master. The sages said: &#x201C;The awe of thy master is likened to the awe of Him Who is in heaven.&#x201D; (Pirke Abot, 4.15). They have, therefore, said: &#x201C;He who differs with his master is likened unto one who differs with the Shekinah, even as it is said: &#x2018;When they strove against God&#x2019;&#x201D; (Num. 26.9; Sanhedrin, 110a). Whosoever strives with his master is like unto one who strives against the Shekinah, even as it is said: &#x201C;Where the children of Israel strove with the Lord and He was sanctified in them&#x201D; (Ibid. 20.13); and whosoever murmurs against his master is like unto one who murmurs against the Lord, even as it is said: &#x201C;Your murmurs are not against us, but against the Lord&#x201D; (Ex. 16.8); and whosoever has suspicious thoughts against his master is like unto one who has suspicious thoughts against the Shekinah, as it is said: &#x201C;And the people spoke against God and against Moses&#x201D; (Num. 21. 5).<sup><xref rid="fn172">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Who is considered differing from his master? It is he who establishes by himself a school and settles down to preach and instruct without having authority from his master to do so, and his master is living, even though in another state. It is even forbidden to render a decision in the presence of one&#x2019;s master, and whosoever renders a decision in the presence of his master is guilty of an offense punishable by death.<sup><xref rid="fn173">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. If the distance between one and his master be twelve miles, and a man asked him a question, he is permitted to answer it. To separate one from committing a forbidden act, one may decide even in the presence of his master. For instance? Suppose he saw a man doing something which is really forbidden, because he did not know that it is forbidden, or because of his wickedness, he has authority to prevent him from doing it, and say to him: &#x201C;This act is forbidden,&#x201D; even in the presence of his master, and even though his master did not give him the authority to act, for wherever there is a likelihood that the Name would be blasphemed, no honor is meted out to a master. Whereat are these words said? Only in matters which come to pass incidentally, but for one to establish himself for the purpose of rendering decisions, and to sit in a master&#x2019;s chair and render decisions to everyone who may ask of him, even though he be in one end of the world and his master be in the other end of the world, it is forbidden to do so prior to his master&#x2019;s demise, unless he obtained authority from his master. But not everyone whose master died may occupy a master&#x2019;s seat and teach the Torah, save if he be a disciple who attained judicial rank.<sup><xref rid="fn174">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. A student who did not attain judicial rank but renders decisions behold him, he is a wicked, arrogant fool, of whom it is said: &#x201C;For she hath cast down many wounded&#x201D; (Prov. 7.26). Likewise a sage who attained judicial rank but does not render decisions, behold him, he is withholding the Torah, and distributes obstacles in the path of the blind, concerning whom it is said: &#x201C;Yea, many strong men have been slain by her&#x201D; (Ibid.). Those petty students who have not increased their knowledge of the Torah as they should and yet are seeking to appear great before the ignorant, and among their towns-people, jumping forward to occupy a front seat to judge and instruct among Israel, are the ones who multiply strife, and the ones who destroy the world, who extinguish the light of the Torah, and despoil the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts, concerning whom Solomon in his wisdom said: &#x201C;Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards&#x201D;. (Song of Songs, 2.15.).<sup><xref rid="fn175">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. A student is forbidden to call his master by name even out of his presence, provided the name be of note that whosoever hears it will know that it is he; neither should he mention his name in his presence, nor even call others whose name are identical with the name of his master, even as one does with respect to the name of his father; but he should always refer to them with a pseudonym even after their demise. He must not salute his master or return salutation in a manner companions give and return among themselves. The manner to salute a master is to bow before him and say to him in tones of awe and respect: &#x201C;Peace be unto thee, my master!&#x201D; If his master saluted him first, he should answer him: &#x201C;Peace be unto thee, my lord and my teacher.<sup><xref rid="fn176">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. So should he not remove his phylacteries in the presence of his master, and not lean but sit as if he were sitting in the presence of a king. He should not pray in front of his master, back of his master, or by the side of his master; needless to say, that he is forbidden to walk beside him. But he should distance himself behind his master, yet not straight back of him, when after he may pray. He should not enter a bath-house together with his master, and not sit in his master&#x2019;s place, and neither decide an argument in his favor when he is present nor destroy his argument. He should not sit in his presence until he will tell him to sit down, nor stand up before him until he will tell him to stand up or until he will obtain permission to stand up. When he is to take leave from his master he should not turn around with his back to his master, but step backwards, his face toward his master&#x2019;s face.<sup><xref rid="fn177">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. He is obliged to rise up before his master when he will behold his approach from as far a distance as his eyes can see and remain standing until his master&#x2019;s figure will disappear; but he must not behold his full figure pass by and immediately thereafter sit down. A man is obliged to visit his master on a holiday.<sup><xref rid="fn178">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. No deference should be given to a student in the presence of his master unless it was the custom of his master to treat him with deference. All manner of work which a man servant does for his master a student should do for his master. If, however, he happened to be in a place where he is unknown and he had no phylacteries on himself, fearing lest he be mistaken for a slave, he is not obliged to buckle on or remove his master&#x2019;s shoes. Whosoever prevents his disciples from rendering him service, deprives him of loving kindness and unyokes him of the fear of Him Who is in heaven. Any student who makes light of aught of all things pertaining to the honor of his master, causes the Shekinah to be removed from among Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn179">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. If one beholds his master transgressing the words of the Torah, he should say to him: &#x201C;Our master, you have instructed us such and thus.&#x201D; Whenever he quotes a lecture in the presence of his master, he should say: &#x201C;So have you, our master, instructed us.&#x201D; He must not repeat aught of his master&#x2019;s teachings unless he mentions the name of the one who said it. At the demise of his master, he should rend all of his garments until his chest be exposed, and he should never mend the garments. Whereat are these words directed? Only respecting his true master, of whom he learned most of his wisdom; but if he did not learn from him most of his wisdom, behold, he is no more to him than a fellow student and is not obliged to honor him in all the aforesaid matters. Nevertheless, he should rise before him, and at his demise, he should rend the garment even as he does rend at the demise of all whose loss he mourns. Even if one did not learn from his master but one word whether of great or of small importance, he should rise before him during his life-time and rend his garments at his demise.<sup><xref rid="fn180">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. Moreover, every disciple of the wise, of proper ideas does not speak in the presence of him who is greater than himself in wisdom, although he learned nothing at all from him.<sup><xref rid="fn181">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. An accredited Rabbi who desires to forego all of these attentions pertaining to his honor, or one of them, either to all of his disciples or to one of them, the discretion is in his own power. Nevertheless, the disciple is obliged to adore him even at the very time when he foregoes all honor due to him.<sup><xref rid="fn182">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. Even as the students are obliged to honor the master, so is the master obliged to treat his disciples with deference and to draw them near himself. Thus said the sages: &#x201C;Ever let the honor of thy disciple be dear unto thee even as thine own.&#x201D; (Pirke Abot, 4.15). And it is essential for a man to care for his disciples and to love them, for they are the sons who make life enjoyable, both, in this world and in the world to come.</p>
<p>13. The students increase the master&#x2019;s wisdom and broaden his heart. The sages said: &#x201C;Much wisdom have I learned from my masters, more than that from my colleagues, but from my disciples more than from all of them combined.&#x201D; (Ta&#x2019;anit, 7a). Even as a little fagot kindles the big one, so a small disciple sharpens the mind of the master to the end that he brings forth from him by his questions a beautified wisdom.<sup><xref rid="fn183">13</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER VI</h1>
<p>1. It is mandatory to respect every disciple of the wise even though he be not one&#x2019;s master, for it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head and honor the face of the old men&#x201D; (Lev. 19.32); the old man herein spoken of is, the old man who acquired wisdom. Whence-onward is the obligation to rise before him applicable? From the time he will approach within four ells until he will pass by from in the front of him.</p>
<p>2. There is no rising up in a bath house, nor in a lavatory, for it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt rise and honor&#x201D;, a rising up which is accompanied by honor. Working men are not obliged to rise up before the disciples of the wise, during their working hours, for it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt rise up and honor&#x201D;, even as doing honor does not cause a loss to the purse, so must the rising up be without loss to the purse. Whence do we know that one is forbidden to close his eyes at the approach of a wise man so as not to see him at the time when he is obligated to rise before him? From what it is said: &#x201C;And thou shalt fear thy God&#x201D; (Ibid.), herefrom we infer that of everything which belongs to one&#x2019;s heart, it is said: &#x201C;And thou shalt fear thy God&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn184">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. It is improper for a wise man to be troublesome to the public by timing himself to appear in their presence so that they may rise up before him, but he shall take the shortest path in passing them by and arrange it so that they may not see him, and not be troubled to rise up. The wise men of yore did round out their walks and follow the outer path where their acquaintances do not frequent, so as not to burden them.<sup><xref rid="fn185">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. One who is riding is entitled to the same deference as the one who is walking, and as it is obligatory to rise before one who is walking, so it is obligatory to rise before one who is riding.<sup><xref rid="fn186">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. When a company of three are walking on the way, the master shall be in the middle, the better scholar on his right, and the lesser one on his left.<sup><xref rid="fn187">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. He who sees a wise man approaching does not rise before him until he will be within four ells, and as soon as he passes by, he may sit down; he who sees a dean of a tribunal passing by must rise before him as soon as his eyes behold him from a distance and not sit down until he will pass him by and be back of him four ells; he who sees the president of the tribunal approaching he should rise before him as soon as his eyes behold him and not sit down until he will take his seat, or until he will walk away out of his sight. The president of a tribunal who renounces all these attentions of honor, his renunciation thereof is valid. When the president enters, the whole audience rises and do not sit down until he will tell them, &#x201C;Be sitted.&#x201D; When the dean of a tribunal enters, two lines are formed in his honor and the people on either side remain standing until he enters and sits down on his place, but the rest of the audience remain sitting in their places.<sup><xref rid="fn188">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. When a Rabbi enters, every one whom he passes by within four ells rises before him, so that one rises up and another sits down, until he reaches and sits down on his place. The sons of the wise and the disciples of the wise, when the public stands in need of their services, may step by the elders of the people and take their own places; but it is no praise for the disciples of the wise to arrive last. When the wise man leaves, as he has a need to, when he has a need, he may return to his own place. The sons of the wise, when they have ability to understand are seated facing their fathers, but if they have no ability to understand, they are seated facing the audience.<sup><xref rid="fn189">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. A student who is continuously in the presence of his master, is not permitted to rise up before him save morning and evening, so that his master&#x2019;s honor should not appear to be greater than the honor of Him Who is in Heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn190">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. For one who is old and distinguished in age, though not a scholar, it is obligatory to rise up; even a young scholar should rise before an old man distinguished in age; but the obligation is not to rise before him in full height, only enough to honor him. It is proper to honor with words even the aged Kuthean and to give him a leaning hand, as it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head&#x201D;, the inference being that it includes all hoary heads.<sup><xref rid="fn191">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. The disciples of the wise do not go forth personally to work with the rest of the population on construction and digging for the state, or like labor so as not to expose themselves to be degraded by the ignorant people. They should not be levied upon for the erection of a wall, repairing of the gates, wages for the watchman and the like, nor for the king&#x2019;s gift-fund. They should not be obliged to contribute to taxes, whether it be a fixed tax levied upon the inhabitants of the city, or whether it be a fixed tax upon every individual, for it is said: &#x201C;But even though they should spend gifts among the nations, now will I gather them and they shall be humbled a little through the burden of the king and princes&#x201D; (Hos. 8.10). If a disciple of the wise had merchandise to sell, he should be permitted to be first to sell it, and no one else in the market should be permitted to sell until he will sell out. Likewise, if he had a trial, and he was standing among many others who had law suits, he should have precedence, and given a place to sit down.<sup><xref rid="fn192">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. It is a grievous sin to disgrace the wise or to hate them. The destruction of Jerusalem did not come about until the disciples of the wise in its midst were disgraced, even as it is said: &#x201C;But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets&#x201D; (II Chron. 36.16), as if saying, they despised those who instructed His words. Such is also the meaning of the words of the Torah in saying: &#x201C;Thus if ye so reject My statutes&#x201D; (Lev. 26.16), those who instruct My statutes ye so reject. He who disgraces the wise has no share in the World to Come and is in the category of such of whom it is said: &#x201C;Because he hath despised the word of the Lord&#x201D; (Num. 15.31).<sup><xref rid="fn193">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. Although he who disgraces the wise is deprived of a share in the World to Come, if witnesses testify that one did disgrace him even with words, the offense is punishable by excommunication, if he be found guilty, the tribunal should excommunicate him publicly, or fine him a gold pound in every instance and give it to the scholar. He who disgraces the wise by words, even after the latter&#x2019;s demise, the tribunal should excommunicate him, but it may, when he will repent, remove the stigma from him. But if the wise man be living, the tribunal has no authority to remove the stigma from him until the one for whose sake he was excommunicated will consent to it. The wise man himself may likewise pronounce an excommunication to defend his honor against an ignoramus who acted irresponsibly toward him, and he needs no witnesses and no warning, and the stigma should not be removed from him until he will apologize to the wise man. If the wise man dies, a tribunal of three may assemble and remove the stigma from him. However, if the wise man desires to forgive him and not ostracize him, the discretion is in his hands.<sup><xref rid="fn194">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. A master who pronounced an excommunication in defense of his honor, all his disciples are obliged to follow the customs of ostracism against the one so ostracised; but if a disciple pronounced an ostracism in defense of his honor, the master is not obliged to follow the manners of ostracism against the one so ostracised, but the public is obliged to follow the customs of ostracism against him. Likewise, one who is ostracised by the president of a tribunal is ostracised to all Israel, but one ostracised to all Israel is not ostracised to the president; one ostracised in his own community is ostracised to every other community, but one ostracised in another community is not ostracised to his own community.<sup><xref rid="fn195">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. All of these apply only against one who was ostracised because he insulted the disciples of the wise, but one who was ostracised on account of other matters which carry a penalty of ostracism, even though the ostracism was pronounced by the smallest one in Israel, both the president and all Israel are obliged to follow the custom of ostracism against him until he will repent himself from the thing on account of which he was ostracised, when the stigma may be removed from him. On account of twenty-four different offenses the punishment of ostracism is inflicted upon a person, whether it be man or woman. They are: (1) he who disgraces the wise even after his demise; (2) he who disgraces a messenger of a tribunal; (3) he who calls his fellow a slave; (4) he whom a tribunal summoned to appear and set a date for his appearance and he did not come; (5) he who scoffs at a matter enacted by the scribes, needless to say, a matter mentioned in the Torah; (6) he who did not carry out a judgment of a tribunal is ostracised until he will comply; (7) he who keeps in his premises something which may cause damages, such as a bad dog, or a broken step ladder, is ostracised until he will remove the damaging article; (8) he who sells his immovable property to an idolater is ostracised until he will assume responsibility of any mishap that may be brought about by the idolater against his fellow, the Israelite, his erstwhile adjoining neighbor; (9) he who testifies against an Israelite in the idolatrous court, and judgment is obtained against him as a result of his evidence to pay money contrary to the laws of Israel, is ostracised until he will make restitution; (10) a priest who is a butcher and does not separate the priestly gifts and give them to another priest is ostracised until he will give; (11) he who disgraces the second day of a holiday in Diaspora, even though it is but a custom;<sup><xref rid="fn196">13</xref></sup> (12) he who does servile work during the afternoon of Passover Eve; (13) he who mentions the Name of Him Who is in heaven in vain or takes oath by the Name in non-essential matters; (14) he who causes many to commit blasphemy against the Name; (15) he who causes many to eat holy food without<sup><xref rid="fn197">14</xref></sup>; (16) he who calculates years and appoints months in Diaspora<sup><xref rid="fn198">15</xref></sup>; (17) he who causes the blind to stumble<sup><xref rid="fn199">16</xref></sup>; (18) he who deprives many of performing a mandatory commandment; (19) a butcher who underhandedly deals out terefah; (20) a Sho&#x2019;het who practices She&#x2019;hita without having his slaughtering knife examined by and obtained authority from a Rabbi; (21)he who consciously brings on erection; (22)he who divorced his wife and then forms a partnership between himself and her, or establishes a business which brings them together, when they appear before a tribunal, they should be ostracised; (23) a scholar of a universally evil reputation<sup><xref rid="fn200">17</xref></sup>; (24) he who excommunicates one who was not guilty of an offense punishable by excommunication.<sup><xref rid="fn201">18</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER VII</h1>
<p>1. A wise man aged in wisdom, or a president, or a dean of a tribunal who committed an unsavory act should never be excommunicated publicly, unless he imitated Jeroboam son of Nebat and his associates<sup><xref rid="fn202">1</xref></sup>; but if he commit any other sin, the punishment of lashes should be administered secretly, even as it is said: &#x201C;Therefore shalt thou stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night&#x201D; (Hosea, 4.5), even though he stumbled, cover it with darkness as the night. However, he should be told: &#x201C;Honor yourself and remain in your house&#x201D;. And even so, when a disciple of the wise be found guilty of an offense punishable by excommunication, it is forbidden to jump to conclusions hastily and excommunicate him; it is rather commendable to run away from such thing, and avoid it. The pious among the wise prided themselves that they were never numbered among those who excommunicated a disciple of the wise, although it is permissable to be counted in to inflict lashes if he be guilty of an offense punishable by lashes, and even be counted in to inflict upon him scourge of rebellion.<sup><xref rid="fn203">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. How is the excommunication pronounced? The authority says: &#x201C;That one (naming him) should be in seclusion.&#x201D; If the excommunication is in the presence of the offender, he says to him: &#x201C;This one (naming him) is in seclusion&#x201D;. An excommunication of exclusion is pronounced in this way: &#x201C;That one (naming him) is excluded&#x201D;. An excommunication of separation is pronounced as follows: &#x201C;He is accursed; the oath of cursing is in him; there is forswearing in him&#x201D; (Shebu&#x2019;ot, 36a).</p>
<p>3. How is the bond of excommunication or ostracism released? The authority says to him: &#x201C;Thou mayest (come back), thou art forgiven&#x201D;. If he releases him in absenta he says: &#x201C;That one (naming him) may (come back), and he is forgiven.&#x201D;</p>
<p>4. What regulations should one under sentence of separation follow himself, and how should others act toward him? One under sentence of separation is forbidden to shave and wash, as one in mourning, all the days of his separation. He must not be counted in among three to bless God after meals, or among ten in any religious service which requires ten adults, and no one is permitted to sit within four ells of him. Nevertheless, he may give instruction to others and others may instruct him, and others may hire him and he may hire others. If his demise occurs while under sentence of separation, the tribunal has a stone sent which is deposited upon his coffin, as if saying that he is being stoned because he had to be separated from the community. Needless to say that no mourning is permitted after him, and that his hearse is not followed.<sup><xref rid="fn204">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. Of greater punishment than he is the one excluded, who is forbidden to instruct others or be instructed by others (although he may study by himself so as not to forget his learning) either to hire himself out or hire others, either to give or to receive in business, with none to deal with him, save for the barest necessities of his support.<sup><xref rid="fn205">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. He who remains thirty days under sentence of separation and appears not for release, another sentence of separation is pronounced against him. If he again remains thirty days and seeks no release, a sentence of exclusion is pronounced against him.<sup><xref rid="fn206">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. How large a personnel does it require to release the bonds of separation or exclusion?<sup>6</sup> Three, even uneducated. An individual scholar may release the bond of separation or exclusion by himself. A student is authorized to release the bonds of separation or exclusion, even instead of the master.<sup><xref rid="fn207">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. If three pronounce an excommunication against one and depart, meantime the offender repents of the sin on account of which sentence was imposed, three others may come and release him.<sup><xref rid="fn208">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. One ignorant as to who imposed the sentence upon him, should go to the president who may release him.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>10. If a conditional sentence was imposed upon him, even on his own evidence, he must receive release. A disciple of the wise who imposed a sentence of separation upon himself;<sup><xref rid="fn209">10</xref></sup> even the sentence was based upon the opinion of another, and even if it be on account of a matter which carries the punishment of separation, he may release the bond by himself.<sup><xref rid="fn210">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. He who dreamt that a sentence of excommunication was pronounced upon him, although he remembers the one who made the pronouncement, must have ten men who are capable of studying treatises to release him. If he finds them not, he should walk a mile to find them; if such can not be found, even ten who study Mishnah may release him; if such can not be found, ten who can read the Torah may release him; if such can not be found, even ten who can not read at all may release him; if there be no ten adults in his place, even three can release him.<sup><xref rid="fn211">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. One against whom a pronouncement of excommunication was made in his presence, is not released save when he is present. If the pronouncement was made in absenta, the release may be given, both in his presence and in his absence. There is no interval necessary between pronouncement and release; a bond of separation may be imposed, and, if the offender doth repent himself, he may be released the same minute. Yet, if the tribunal see fit to leave one under ban many years, he may be so left, all depending upon his wickedness. Likewise, if the tribunal see fit to first exclude one and then exclude whomsoever that will eat with him, drink with him, or stand within four ells of him, such exclusion should stand so as to punish him, and so as to make a guard around the Torah which the sinners will be unable to break. Although a scholar is vested with authority to excommunicate to preserve his honor, it is not good taste for a disciple of the wise to accustom himself to do such thing, but conceal his ears from the gossip of the ignorant people, and pay no attention to them, as the subject was spoken of in Solomon&#x2019;s wisdom: &#x201C;Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken&#x201D; (Ecc. 7.21). So was the way of the pious of yore: they heard themselves maligned, but made no reply; moreover, they pardoned the traducer and condoned him. Great scholars prided themselves in their becoming conduct and related that they have ever declined to pronounce an excommunication of separation or exclusion against a man for the sake of their honor. Such way of disciples of the wise is proper to follow. Whereat are these words directed? When one abused him maligned him secretly; but a disciple of the wise, who was abused or maligned by a man publicly, is forbidden to pardon an offense against his honor, and if he does pardon it he is punished in the end, for it is disgraceful to the Torah; he must avenge it and beat it in his heart serpent-like until the traducer will beg his pardon, when he should forgive him.<sup><xref rid="fn212">13</xref></sup></p>

A master who decided that a woman whose husband fell in unending waters may re-marry; likewise every tribunal that would pay attention to the request for relief of one who violated his vow is ostracised, and there are many others.&#x201D; This is no criticism. The laws mentioned by R<small>ABD</small>., Maimonides mentions in their proper place; here he only enumerates the transgressions for which man and woman are excommunicated. Moreover, he was loathe to add to the number because of the universal aversion among scholars to pronounce ostracism against a scholar, even against one of a universally evil reputation, saying that one of such character long ceased to be counted in among scholars.

<ftnote id="fn201"><sup>18</sup>&#x201C;He who excommunicates one not guilty of an offense punishable by excommunication. This law he derived from the incident of Simeon Ben Lakish (Mo&#x2019;ed Katan, 17a), who kept a vineyard etc. By the life of my head there is no Pilpulistic inference here, for the matters he enumerates, the tribunal is obliged to ostracise him, but in such instance the tribunal would not pay attention to Rabbi Simeon Ben Lakish; on the contrary, the one whom he excommunicated, in defending his honor, the excommunication should stand&#x201D;.

<p><sup>4</sup>&#x201C;How large a personnel etc. This is not so; but an equal number to the tribunal pronouncing the excommunication, and of equal scholarly standing is required for release. Possibly this refers to a release during the period of sentence, but at its expiration any three or one scholar may release him. Or, when one not a scholar pronounced the excommunication on account of a transgression, after the expiration of the time of sentence, any three or an individual scholar may release him; but if many made the pronouncement, an equal number of like standing is required&#x201D;.

Maimonides contends that a scholar releases himself even in a matter where separation is justified, basing his decision on Mo&#x2019;ed Katan 17a, and Nedarim, 7a. The apparent contradiction of Judah, is no contradiction at all, as Judah bound himself to bring Benjamin back, which is a bond to perform a definite thing, in which case Maimonides does not sanction the release by one&#x2019;s own self. Jacob did not release him, because Judah brought Benjamin back and delivered to Jacob, which was sufficient ground to believe that there was no need for a release. C. G.</ftnote>

<h1>CHAPTER I</h1>
<p>1. In the days of Enosh, the sons of man erred exceedingly, the advice of the wise man of that generation was nullified, and even Enosh himself was among the victims of that folly. Their mistake was this: Seeing, said they, that God created these stars and planets to rule the world, that He placed them high above to share honors with them, for they are ministers who render service in his presence, it is proper that they be praised and glorified and honored, this is the will of God, to exalt and honor him whom He exalted and honored, even as a king desires to honor those who stand in his presence, for such is the honor of the king. As soon as this matter was rooted in their heart, they commenced to erect temples in honor of the stars, to offer sacrifices to them, to praise and glorify them in words, and bow down to them in order to reach the will of God by this evil idea. This was the groundwork for the worship of stars. Thus was the statement of its adherents who knew the principles thereof; not that they asserted that there was no God save a particular star. This is as Jeremiah says: &#x201C;Who would not fear Thee, O King of the nations? For it befitted Thee; Forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royalty, there is none like unto Thee. But they are altogether brutish and foolish; the vanities by which they are instructed are but a stock&#x201D; (Jer. 10.7&#x2013;8). As if saying: All know that Thou art Alone; but their mistake and foolishness is in supposing that this vanity is Thy will.<sup><xref rid="fn213">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. In the long process of time, there arose among the sons of man false prophets, who asserted that God commanded them saying: &#x201C;Worship yon star, or all of the stars, and offer sacrifices to it, and compound for it thus and such, and erect a temple for it, and hew its image so that all of the people, women and children and the rest of the populace included, bow down to it&#x201D;. He, moreover, describes for them a form which he invented and tells them that this was the image of yon star which was pointed out to him in his prophecy. In this manner they commenced to draw images in temples, beneath trees, upon mountain-tops and elevated places, where they congregated to bow down to them and sermonize to the people, saying: &#x201C;This image has it in its power to do good and evil, and it is proper to worship it, and be in awe of it.&#x201D; Their priests, moreover, say unto them: &#x201C;By this worship you will increase and succeed; do thus and such, but not that and this&#x201D;. Then still other frauds rose up to assert that the star itself, or the planet, or the the angel spoke to them and instructed saying: &#x201C;Worship me thus and such&#x201D;, and thereat made known to them the way to worship them, instructing them, &#x201C;Do so but do not do so&#x201D;. In this manner this thing spread throughout the world, and the worship of images with varied ceremonies, to sacrifice to them and to bow down to them was inaugurated. After the lapse of a long time the Glorified and Awful Name was forgotten to be mentioned by the mouth of all substance and blotted out from their consciousness, so that they gave Him no recognition, as a consequence whereof all the people of the earth as well as women and little children knew not save the image of wood and stone, the stony temple wherein they were brought up from their infancy to bow down to it, to worship it and to swear by its name. As for their wise man, for example, their priests and their like, they supposed that there was no God save the stars and planets for whose sake, and in whose likeness, those images were made; but the Rock of Ages not a man was there to recognize Him or know Him, save some individuals in the whole world, for example, Enoch, Methuselah, Noah, Shem, and Eber. And, on this path the world continued its course of circuity until the birth of the firmest pillar of the world, Abraham our father.</p>
<p>3. As soon as this giant was weaned he commenced to busy his mind, in his infancy he commenced to think by day and by night, and would encounter this enigma: How is it possible that this planet should continuously be in motion and have no leader&#x2014;and who, indeed, causes it to revolve, it being impossible that it should revolve itself? Moreover, he neither had a teacher nor one to impart aught to him, for he was sunk in Ur of the Chaldeans among the foolish worshipers of stars, and his father, and his mother, like all the people, worshiped stars, and he, although following them in their worship, busies his heart and reflects until he attains the path of truth, and, by his correct thinking, he understood when he finally saw the line of righteousness. He knew that there is One God; He leads the planet; He created everything; and in all that is there is no god save He. He knew that the whole world was in error, and that the thing which caused them to err was, that their worshiping the stars and the images brought about the loss of the truth from their consciousness. <sup><xref rid="fn214">2</xref></sup>And, when Abraham was forty years old he recognized his Creator. After he came to this comprehension and knowledge he started to confute the sons of Ur of the Chaldeans, and to organize disputations with them, cautioning them, saying: &#x201C;This is not the true path that you are following&#x201D;, and he destroyed the images, and commenced preaching to the people warning them that it is not right to worship any save the God of the universe, and unto Him alone it is right to bow down, to offer sacrifices, and compound offerings, so that the creatures of the future shall recognize Him. Moreover, it is right to destroy and break in pieces all of the images, so that the whole population of the future be not led to an error like unto these who imagine that there is no God save these images. When he had them subdued by his well supported contentions, the king tried to put him to death, but he was saved by a miracle, and went hence to Haran. There he stood up anew and called out in a great voice to the whole world, to let them know that there is One God for the whole universe, and unto Him it is proper to render service. And thus he went onward with his proclamations from city to city, and from government to government, until he attained the land of Canaan amidst his outcry, even as it is said: &#x201C;And called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God&#x201D; (Gen. 21.33). When the people who congregated about him asked him concerning his preachments, he replied by imparting knowledge to each and every one according to his mentality, to the end that he was able to turn him to the path of truth, until there congregated about him thousands, even tens of thousands, and they became the people of Abraham&#x2019;s household, in whose heart he implanted this great cause, concerning which he compiled books, and which he imparted to his son Isaac.<sup><xref rid="fn215">3</xref></sup> Isaac, from his seat of learning, gave instructions and admonitions. And Isaac, in turn, imparted it to Jacob and appointed him head master, who, at his seat of learning, gave instructions and supported all who flocked to him. And Jacob our father instructed all his sons, but separated Levi and appointed him head master, and established him in a seat of learning where to instruct in the path of the Name and in the observance of the charges of Abraham. He, moreover, commanded his sons not to interrupt the succession of the sons of Levi to the presidency of the school so that the learning be not forgotten. So did the movement advance intensely among the sons of Jacob and their followers that the world saw a God-knowing nation called into existence, until Israel spent a long time in Egypt, when they turned to be instructed in their practice and to worship the stars as they did, save only the tribe of Levi, which remained faithful to their ancestorial charge; for the tribe of Levi at no time worshiped stars. Verily, in but a short space of time, the root which Abraham had planted would have been uprooted, and the sons of Jacob would have turned to the universal error and wandering; save because of the Lord&#x2019;s love for us, and because He observes the oath of covenant with Abraham our father, He appointed Moses our Master lord of all prophets, and made him His messenger. After Moses our Master was endowed with prophecy and the Lord chose Israel as an inheritance, He crowned them with commandments, and made known to them the way to serve Him, and what will be the judgment rendered against idolatry and all its erring devotees.<sup>3</sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER II</h1>
<p>1. The primary warning concerning worship of stars is, not to reverence any among all creatures, no angel, no planet, no star, none of the four elements nor any of their offspring, though the worshiper be conscious that the Lord is God and, he be worshiping a given being as at the inception of the worship of Enosh and the people of his generation, behold him, he worships idolatry. It is respecting this very subject that the warning in the Torah was given, saying: &#x201C;And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which, the Lord thy God hath alloted unto all the peoples under the whole heaven&#x201D; (Deut. 4.19.), that is to say, lest thou spread out in thy mind&#x2019;s vision, beholding that these are guiding the universe, and that God portioned them out to all the world to live in perpetuity and not wane as the course of the universe is, and then say that to such it is right to bow down and to worship; even on this very subject He commanded and said: &#x201C;Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived&#x201D; (Ibid. 11.16.), that is to say, do not fall in error by the thought of your heart to worship these, to make of them a mediator between yourselves and the Creator.<sup><xref rid="fn216">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. The idolaters compiled many books of worship, defining its principle manner of service, its works and its laws; but the Holy One, blessed be He! charged us not to read those books at all, not to think of idolatry generally nor of aught of its details. Moreover, to look at it is forbidden, as it is said: &#x201C;Turn ye not unto idols&#x201D; (Lev. 19.4.); and of thinking on this subject it is said: &#x201C;And that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their god&#x201D;? (Ibid.), which is a warning that thou shalt not inquire concerning its manner of practice, though thou art not worshiping it, for this very inquiry causes a turning after it and to imitate their practice, as it is further said: &#x201C;Even so will I do likewise&#x201D; (Ibid.).<sup><xref rid="fn217">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. All of these prohibitive commandments are concentrated on one subject, namely: Not to turn after idolatry, and whosoever does turn after it by doing aught resembling its practice is guilty of an offense punishable by lashes. And, yet, not turning after idolatry alone in one&#x2019;s thoughts is forbidden, for even concerning all thought which causes man to delete a principle of the fundamentals of the Torah are we charged not to offer it to our heart, not to concentrate our mind thereon and reason it out and be drawn after the swerving fancies of the heart. Preceding all, behold, the short-coming of man&#x2019;s intelligence, more particularly that not all minds can attain the purity of truth. Now, if every man be drawn away after his heart&#x2019;s fancies, he will be discovered demolishing the world to fit in the shortsightedness of his intelligence. For example: some of the time he will search after idolatry, and some of the time he will meditate about the Unity of the Creator, perhaps He is, and perhaps He is not, what of above and what of below, what of the beginning and what of the end; some of the time he will meditate concerning prophecy, perhaps there is, and perhaps there is not, and some of the time about the Torah, perhaps it is from heaven and perhaps it is not. Whereas, he knows not the standard of thinking wherewith to discover the knowledge of pure truth, as a consequence whereof he goes without to atheism. Even on, this subject there is a warning in the Torah, for it says therein: &#x201C;And that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray&#x201D; (Num. 15. 39.), as if saying: &#x201C;Let not any of you be drawn after his short-sighted intelligence and imagine that his fancy attains the truth&#x201D;. Thus did the wise men say: &#x201C;After your own heart&#x201D;, is a warning against atheism; and &#x201C;After your own eyes&#x201D;, is a warning against prostitution (Berakot, 13a). But the violation of this prohibitive commandment, although it causes man&#x2019;s disability to share in the World to Come, is not punishable by lashes.<sup><xref rid="fn218">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. The precept concerning idolatry balances all other commandments, for it is said: &#x201C;And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which the Lord hath spoken unto Moses&#x201D; (Num. 15.22), which was traditionally instructed that the Verse speaks of idolatry. Herefrom you deduct that whosoever admits idolatry denies the whole Torah, all of the prophets, and all in that which the prophets were instructed since Adam even till the end of time, as it is said: &#x201C;From the day that the Lord gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations&#x201D; (Ibid. 15.23). But whosoever denies idolatry admits the whole Torah, all of the prophets, and all in that which the prophets were instructed since Adam even till the end of time. Thus it is the outstanding commandment of them all.<sup><xref rid="fn219">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. An Israelite who worshiped<sup><xref rid="fn220">5</xref></sup> idolatry, behold him, he is in everything to be judged as an idolater, and not as an Israelite who violates a prohibitive commandment punishable by stoning. A convert to idolatry, behold him, he is rebellious against the whole scope of the Torah. Likewise are infidels of among Israel not to be judged in aught as Israelites, nor should they ever be received as penitents, for it is said: &#x201C;None that go unto her return, neither do they attain unto the paths of life&#x201D; (Prov. 2.19). The infidels are they that absorb themselves in the swerving fancies of their heart about the brutish matters hereinabove spoken of, as a consequence whereof they transgress by stepping upon the vitals of the Torah with spite, soul-sickening and high-handedness, and proclaim that therein lies no iniquity. It is forbidden to converse with them, and to answer any argument concerning them, as it is said: &#x201C;And come not nigh the door of her house&#x201D; (Ibid. 5.8). As a rule the thought of an infidel drifts toward idolatry.<sup><xref rid="fn221">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. Whosoever admits idolatry as truth, although he be not a worshiper thereof, behold him, he is shaming and blaspheming the Glorified and Awful Name. The idolater&#x2019;s corpse is, therefore hung, even as that of the blasphemer&#x2019;s, and both offenses are punishable by stoning. It is even for this reason that I included the law of the blasphemer in the treatise concerning idolatry, for both of them deny the source of everything.<sup><xref rid="fn222">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. And, these are the laws concerning the blasphemer: The guilt punishable by stoning is not pronounced against a blasphemer unless he actually pronounces the Particular Name of four letters, Aleph, Dallat, Nun, Yod, and blaspheme Him in a Name of the Names which are forbidden to erase, even as it is said: &#x201C;And he that blasphemed the name of the Lord&#x201D; (Lev. 24. 16). By naming the Particular Name he is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning, but by naming all other Attributes he is guilty of an offense punishable by stripes. There is some authority who asserts that he is not quilty save on pronouncing the Name Yod, Hei, Vov, Hei. But I maintain that he is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning in pronouncing either of the Particular Names.<sup><xref rid="fn223">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. Whence do we derive a prohibitive commandment against the blasphemer? It is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt not revile God&#x201D; (Ex. 22.27). Each and every day, during a trial for blasphemy, the witnesses are examined and they give testimony not repeating the Name pronounced and words used by the defendant, but an alias, such as &#x201C;Let Jesse smite Jesse&#x201D;, indicative that four letters were pronounced and that the words were abusive. When the enquette is concluded, the public is ordered out of court, and the elder of the witnesses is examined, saying: &#x201C;Now, repeat what you have heard in identical language&#x201D;; he repeats, while the judges remain standing on their feet, and when they hear the actual blasphemy repeated, they rent their garments which they never mend. Their second witness merely states: &#x201C;Even I heard identically as he repeated&#x201D;. If there were many witnesses it is necessary for each and every one of them to repeat identically as had heard it from the blasphemer.<sup><xref rid="fn224">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. A blasphemer who repented his statement the moment he made it, can not put it up as a defense, but having blasphemed in the presence of witnesses the punishment of stoning is inflicted upon him. He who blasphemed the Name by pretending that he reviles idolatry, jealous people may challenge him and be put to them by them; but if jealous people did not put him to death and he was brought to justice before a tribunal, he is not stoned, for such sentence is pronounced only when he blasphemed by a name of the Particular Names.<sup><xref rid="fn225">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. Whosoever hears the Name being blasphemed is obliged to rend his garments; even when an alias is used in blaspheming, if the reviler be an Israelite, he is obliged to rend his garments. He who hears the blasphemy direct or he who hears it from a witness, both, are obliged to rend their garments. But he who hears it from an idolater is not obliged to rend his garments. As for Eliakim and Shebnah<sup><xref rid="fn226">11</xref></sup>, they rent not their garment save because Rab-shakeh was a converted Israelite. All the judges and witnesses in a blasphemy case, successively put their hand upon the head of the blasphemer, each one saying to him: &#x201C;Thy blood be upon thy head, thou alone hast brought it upon thyself&#x201D;. Of all upon whom a tribunal pronounces the sentence of death there is none upon whose head the hands of the judges and witnesses are put, save upon the blasphemer, even as it is said: &#x201C;And let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head&#x201D; (Lev. 24.14).<sup><xref rid="fn227">12</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER III</h1>
<p>1. Whosoever worships idolatry, of his own free will, wantonly, is guilty of an offense punishable by excision; but if the worship took place in the presence of witnesses, and he was duly warned, he is sentenced to be stoned. If the worship was committed in ignorance, he should bring a standard sin-offering.<sup><xref rid="fn228">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. The idolaters fixed many kinds of service for each and every image and form, and the service of one is unlike the service of the other; for example, Peor, whose mode of worship it is for one to have himself exposed before it, or Mercury, which is worshiped by having stones thrown at it or from it, and many more like services were inaugurated to images. Therefore, if one reverses the service by exposing himself to Mercury or by throwing stones at Peor, he is not guilty, for he must worship it after the manner of its service, as it is said: &#x201C;How used these nations to serve their gods? even so will I do likewise&#x201D; (Deut. 12.30). The subject being such, and because thereof, a tribunal, judging cases of idolatry should know the modes of its worship, seeing that no punishment of stoning is pronounced on idolaters unless they know that the mode of worship is identical with the testimony presented at the trial.<sup><xref rid="fn229">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. The prohibitive commandment concerning such worship is deducted from what Holy Writ says: &#x201C;Nor serve them&#x201D; (Ex. 20.5; Deut. 5.9). Whereat are these words directed? At all other manner of worship, save bowing down, slaughtering sacrifice, burning incense, and compounding drink offering; for whosoever employs any of these kinds of worship to revive any form of idolatry, is guilty, although it be not the particular manner of its worship. For example? If one offered a drink offering to Peor, or slaughtered a sacrifice to Mercury, he is guilty, as it is said: &#x201C;He that sacrificeth unto the gods, save unto the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed&#x201D; (Ex. 22.19.). Inasmuch as slaughtering sacrifices was included in worship generally, why was it singled out and separated from other modes of service? To teach you, even as slaughtering sacrifices is a particular manner of service dedicated to the Name, and whosoever offers sacrifices to another god is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning, whether its mode of worship was to slaughter sacrifices for it or whether it was not, even so every service which is dedicated to the Name, if he employed it in his service to another god, whether its manner of worship be so or not, is guilty. Even because thereof it is, moreover, said: &#x201C;For thou shalt bow down to no other god&#x201D; (Ex. 34.14), to prescribe guilt for bowing down to idolatry even if its mode of service be not so. So is also the law pertaining to offering incense and drink-offering, forsooth, stone-casting and pouring drink offering is one and the same thing.<sup><xref rid="fn230">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. One who smears feces over it, or who compounded urine as a drink-offering for it, is guilty; if he slaughtered a locust as a sacrifice to it,<sup><xref rid="fn231">4</xref></sup> he is not guilty, unless its manner of service be so. Likewise, if he slaughtered a crippled animal as a sacrifice to it, he is not guilty, unless its manner of service be so. An idol which is worshiped by a rod, if he broke the rod by striking at it, he is guilty, and if it be the first service offered to such idol it becomes forbidden property; if he cast the rod at it, he is guilty, but it does not become forbidden property, for casting the rod is unlike sprinkling of blood because the rod remains whole as it was whereas blood is spread in drops. He who proclaims one of all kinds of idolatry as his god, is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning; even if he lift up a brick and said to it: &#x201C;Thou art my god&#x201D;, or to all like in such expression. is guilty, although he repent and the moment he was through proclaiming he said: &#x201C;No, this is not my god&#x201D;, his repentence is null and he is stoned.<sup><xref rid="fn232">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. He who worships idolatry in its usual mood of worship, even in a manner to disgrace it, is guilty. For example? One who exposes himself to Peor in order to show his contempt for it, or casts a stone upon Mercury so as to shame it, is guilty, because such act is its real mode of worship. If he commits an act of this kind in error, he should bring a sin-offering.<sup><xref rid="fn233">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. One who worships idolatry out of love, for instance, he coveted a given image because it was made superbly beautiful, or he worshiped it out of fear lest it perpetrates harm against him, as its devotees imagine that it can do good and evil, if he accepted it as a god he is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning; but if he worshiped it after its mode or worship,<sup><xref rid="fn234">7</xref></sup> or with one of the four kinds of worship<sup><xref rid="fn235">8</xref></sup> either because of love for art or because of superstitious fear, he is guiltless. He embraces an idol, or kisses it, or who prostrates himself before it, who washes it, anoints it, puts shoes on it, or does any other like service of honor violates a prohibitive commandment, for it says: &#x201C;Nor serve them&#x201D; (Ex. 23.24.), and, of course, such attention is included in service. Nevertheless, no lashes is inflicted upon him for doing any of these, seeing that none of them are mentioned in detail.<sup><xref rid="fn236">9</xref></sup> If, however, one of these attentions was a mode of service and he did it in order to worship it, he is guilty.<sup><xref rid="fn237">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. One who had a splinter stuck in his foot and he happens to be before an idol, should not bow down to take out, as it will appear that is bowing down to it. If his coin be scattered before it, he should not bow down to collect it, as it will appear that he is bowing down to it, but he may sit down and then collect it.<sup><xref rid="fn238">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. Water-fountain figures, placed before an idol, in drinking water therefrom one should be careful not to touch his mouth to their mouth, as it will appear that he kisses an idol.<sup><xref rid="fn239">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. One who has an idol made for himself, even though he made it not by his own hand and did not worship it, is striped;<sup><xref rid="fn240">13</xref></sup> because it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any manner of likeness&#x201D; (Ex. 20.4; Deut. 5.8). Even so, if one makes by his own hand an idol for others is striped, though he made it for an idolater; because it is said: &#x201C;Nor make to yourselves molten gods&#x201D; (Lev. 19.4). Therefore, he who makes an idol for himself, by his own hand, is lashed twice.<sup><xref rid="fn241">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. It is forbidden to make images for beauty&#x2019;s sake, even it be not for idolatry; for, it is said: &#x201C;Ye shall not make with Me&#x201D; (Ex. 20.23), as if saying; images of either silver or gold, though they be no more than works of artistic beauty, ye shall not make, so that the erring will not err and imagine they are dedicated to idolatry. But the admonition against it is not applicable to any save to form the image of man. Therefore, the image of man should not be formed in wood, nor in lime, nor in stone, provided, however, that the image be protruding, as for instance, the figure or the laver in a palace; but if the image was homaloid, or a delineated form, such as the forms upon boards and tablets, or the forms woven in a rug, behold, such is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn242">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. A ring whereon the image of a man is engraved as a seal, if the image be protruding, he is forbidden to keep it in his hand, but is permitted to have the idolator make an impression on wax therewith; if the image be inwardly engraved he is permitted to keep it in his hand, but forbidden to have the idolator make an impression on wax therewith, because the inwardly engraved image will appear protruding from the wax seal. It is likewise forbidden to sketch the image of the sun,<sup><xref rid="fn243">16</xref></sup> of the moon, of the stars, of the planets, and of angels; for, it is said: &#x201C;Ye shall not make with me&#x201D;, that is to say: ye shall not make images like unto My ministers, who minister before Me Above, not even upon a tablet. Images of cattle and other living creatures, save man, and images of trees and plants and the like, one may sketch, even though the image be protruding.<sup><xref rid="fn244">17</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER IV.</h1>
<p>1. The seducers of a city in Israel, behold them, they are stoned, although they themselves did not worship idolatry but seduced the citizens of their city to worship it; but the seduced people of the city are beheaded by the sword, provided they worshiped idolatry, or made it their god. Whencefrom is the prohibitive precept against a seducer deducted? It is said: &#x201C;Neither let it be heard out of thy mouth&#x201D; (Ex. 23.13.)<sup><xref rid="fn245">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. No city is pronounced a seduced city unless its seducers be her own citizens, of the same tribe even as it is said: &#x201C;From the midst of thee, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city&#x201D; (Deut. 13.14.), numbering two or more than two even as it is said: &#x201C;Certain base fellows are gone out&#x201D; (Ibid.), having seduced up to a majority of the citizens, the majority being more than one hundred even to the majority of the tribe, but if an actual majority of the tribe was seduced they are judged as individuals, for it is said: &#x201C;the inhabitants of their city&#x201D; (Ibid.) which means neither a village nor a large city, and every place of less than one hundred citizens is a village and of a majority of a tribe is a large city. Likewise, if women or small children seduced it, or it was seduced by an individual person, or only a minority of its citizens was seduced, or they themselves brought about the seduction, or its seducers were outsiders, the law of a seduced city is not applied to it, but they are judged as individuals who worshiped idolatry, and whosoever did transgress is stoned, and their property is inherited by their lawful successors as the law is concerning all upon whom the tribunal pronounces a sentence of death.<sup><xref rid="fn246">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. A seduced city is not judged by any save by a tribunal of Seventy-One; for, it is said: &#x201C;Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, who have done this evil thing, unto thy gates&#x201D; (Deut. 17.5.), herefrom we deduct that individual worshipers of idolatry are sentenced to death by the tribunal of each and every gate, but many are not sentenced to death by any save by the Great Tribunal.<sup><xref rid="fn247">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. None of the cities of escape is adjudged a seduced city<sup><xref rid="fn248">4</xref></sup>, as it is said: &#x201C;Within any of thy gates&#x201D; (Deut. 17.2); nor is Jerusalem adjudged a seduced city as it was not divided among the tribes. A buffer city must not be adjudged a seduced city, lest the idolaters enter through it and destroy Eretz Ysrael. A single tribunal should not adjudge three cities, one alongside the other, seduced cities,<sup><xref rid="fn249">5</xref></sup> but if they be far apart it may be done.<sup><xref rid="fn250">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. No city is adjudged a seduced city unless its seducers employed plural language in seducing it, saying to them: &#x201C;Let us go and we will worship&#x201D;, or: &#x201C;Let us go and we will offer sacrifices&#x201D;, or: &#x201C;Let us go and we will burn incense&#x201D;, or: &#x201C;Let us go and we will compound a drink-offering&#x201D;, or: &#x201C;Let us go and we will bow down&#x201D;, or: &#x201C;Let us go and we will accept it as a god&#x201D;, and they heard it, and worshiped it in its proper mode of worship, or in either of the four particular kinds of worship<sup><xref rid="fn251">7</xref></sup>, or accepted it as a god. A city charged with seduction, but the evidence showed that not all of the conditions were substantiated either against its inhabitants or against its seducers, how is it to be treated? A warning is given to each and every one of them, and evidence is taken against each and every one of them individually, and any one of them who did worship idolatry is stoned as an individual who worships idolatry, and their property is inherited by their lawful successors.<sup><xref rid="fn252">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. How is the legal procedure against a seduced city instituted? When the information shows that it really deserves to have a pronouncement of a seduced city made against it, the Great Tribunal appoints a commission who investigate and take evidence until they are convinced by clear testimony that the whole, or a majority of the city was really seduced and turned to the worship of idolatry; thereafter two abecedarians are commissioned to warn them and to bring them back to the fold; if they turn and repent, it is well,<sup><xref rid="fn253">9</xref></sup> but if they hold on to their evil, the tribunal instructs all Israel to wage war against them, and they lay siege and array battle with them until the city is broken open, whenafter courts are established and they are put on trial. Each one against whom two witnesses testified that he worshiped idolatry after he received a warning, is separated. If all those who did worship constitute but a minority of the citizens, they are stoned and the rest of the citizens escape punishment. If it be found that a majority worshiped idolatry, they are all taken before the Great Tribunal, where their trial is finished, and all those who are found guilty of having worshiped idolatry are put to death by the sword. If the whole population of the city worshiped idolatry, all of them, women and children included, are put to death by the edge of the sword. Whether the entire city was seduced, or whether only a majority thereof, its seducers are stoned, and its entire booty is gathered in its main street. If it has no such street, it is mandatory to construct such street. If its street was without its boundary-line, a wall should be constructed beyond it, so as to incorporate it within its boundary-line, even as it is said: &#x201C;Into the midst of the broad place thereof&#x201D; (Deut. 13.17). Then, everything that liveth should be put to death, and all of its spoil, together with the property of the whole district should be burned in fire. And it is mandatory to burn it; for, it is said: &#x201C;And shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof&#x201D; (Ibid.)<sup><xref rid="fn254">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. The substance of the righteous therein, who are the rest of the population of the city which was not seduced together with a majority thereof, is burned among its general spoil, because they continued to dwell there their property is forfeited. And, whosoever enjoys aught of the spoil thereof, is lashed, even as it is said: &#x201C;And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thy hand&#x201D; (Ibid, 13.18.).<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>8. If the witness against a seduced city were impeached, whosoever held possession of any of its property enjoys right of ownership thereto, seeing that there was no testimony to destroy it. But wherefore does one acquire the right of property therein? Because after the testimony was given and sentenced pronounced each and every inhabitant yielded his right to his property and rendered it ownerless. A seduced city is never rebuilt, and whosoever rebuilds it is lashed; for, it is said: &#x201C;It shall not be built again&#x201D; (Deut. 13.17.); but in its place it is permitted to lay out gardens and plant vineyards, as the Verse says, &#x201C;it shall not be built again&#x201D;, which means not to rebuild it as a settlement of people as it was heretofore.<sup><xref rid="fn255">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. Tourists who chanced to a city which was pronounced a seduced city and joined the rest of the population in the worship of idolatry, if they lived there thirty days prior to the seduction they are put to death by the sword and their property is destroyed, if not they are stoned and their property belongs to their heirs.<sup><xref rid="fn256">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. Property belonging to another district which had been stored in a seduced city, although the inhabitants of the latter assumed responsibility for its loss, is not burned, but returned back to its owners, as it clearly states &#x201C;the spoil of it&#x201D;, and not the spoil of its neighboring town. Property of the evildoers who were seduced which were stored away in another district, if it can be gathered that day together with its own property, it shall be burned among its spoil, if not, the distance being too far to gather it on the selfsame day, it is not destroyed, but given to their heirs.<sup><xref rid="fn257">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. An animal, half of which was the property of a seduced city and the other half that of another city, is forbidden to be eaten; but dough in a similar state is permitted to be eaten, because it is possible to divide it.<sup><xref rid="fn258">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. An animal of a seduced city which was slaughtered is forbidden, and nought thereof must be enjoyed, even when one slaughters an ox which had been adjudged to be stoned. The proceeds of the hair from the head of either man or woman is permitted to be enjoyed; but cut hair is included among the spoil, and must not be enjoyed.<sup><xref rid="fn259">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. Fruit on the trees therein is permitted; for, it is said: &#x201C;shalt gather&#x201D; and &#x201C;shalt burn&#x201D; (Deut. 13.17.), such should be destroyed as require only gathering and burning, whereas fruit on the trees require gleaning, gathering and burning. This is also applicable to hair on one&#x2019;s head. Needless to say that the trees themselves are permitted, and are, of course, the property of the heirs. The devoted things therein are dealt with as follows: the devoted animals of the altar<sup><xref rid="fn260">17</xref></sup> should be destroyed; &#x201C;The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination&#x201D; (Prov. 21. 27.); the devoted things for the repair of the Temple should be redeemed, and thereafter burned, for it says, &#x201C;Spoil of it&#x201D; (Deut. 13.17.) but not spoil of heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn261">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. The firstborn and the tithes of animals therein, if they be unblemished they are as devoted things of the altar, and they shall be put to death; the blemished are included in its cattle and must be destroyed as spoil. The heaveoffering therein, if the priest already had taken possession thereof it shall be left to rot away because it is his property, but if it be as yet in the hand of the Israelite, it shall be given to a priest of another territory, because it is property of heaven and the devotion thereon is a bodily devotion.<sup><xref rid="fn262">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. Second tithes, the redemption money of second tithes and the sacred writings therein should be treasured away.<sup><xref rid="fn263">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. Whosoever carries out an execution against a seduced city is like one who sacrifices a burnt-offering, even as it is said: &#x201C;Every whit, unto the Lord thy God&#x201D; (Deut. 13.17). Moreover, he removes the fierceness of God&#x2019;s anger from among Israel, even as it is said: &#x201C;That the Lord may turn from the fierceness of His anger&#x201D; (Ibid. 13.18), and brings upon them blessing and mercy, even as it is said: &#x201C;And show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee&#x201D; (Ibid.).<sup><xref rid="fn264">21</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER V</h1>
<p>1. He who entices a single person in Israel, whether man or woman, is stoned, although neither the enticer nor enticed worshiped idolatry, for he taught him to worship; and regardless of whether the seducer was a layman or whether he was a prophet, whether the enticed was an individual, man or woman, or whether there were several individuals, his punishment is death by stoning.<sup><xref rid="fn265">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. One who entices a majority of the people of a city, is not called enticer but seducer. If such one who seduced a majority of the city be a prophet, his punishment is death by stoning, but the seduced are not judged as are the people of a seduced city, unless a minimum of two will commit the seduction. Regardless of whether a prophet said: &#x201C;The idol charged me to serve it&#x201D;, or whether he said: &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He! charged me to worship idolatry&#x201D;, behold him, he is a seductive prophet, and if a majority of the city be seduced by him, he shall be stoned. The enticer, whether he entices by employing plural or singular language, is stoned. For instance? One who says to his friend: &#x201C;Come, I will worship, Come, I will go and officiate at the worshiping; let us both go and worship by performing a certain service by which that particular branch of idolatry is worshiped; stand by, I will sacrifice; follow me, I will go and sacrifice; let us both go and sacrifice; stand by I will burn incense; follow me, I will go and burn incense, let us both go and burn incense; stand by I will compound a drink-offering; follow me, I will go and compound a drink-offering; let us go and compound a drink-offering; behold, I will bow down; follow me, I will go and bow down; let us go and bow down&#x201D;, behold him, he is an enticer. If he enticed two, both of them are witnesses against him, who bring him before the tribunal and testify that such was his statement to them, and he is stoned.<sup><xref rid="fn266">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. There is no legal requirement to give the enticer a warning. If an enticer speaks to one, that one should say to him; &#x201C;I have friends who desire it&#x201D;, and in this way maneuver to have him entice two, so that they may testify against him, and have the sentence of death imposed upon him. If the enticer refuses to entice two at a time, it is mandatory to spy on him. Against none of those who might be envolved in crimes punishable by death is spying permitted, save against this one. How is the spying conducted against him? The enticee brings two witnesses, whom he hides in a dark place, so that they can see the enticer and hear his words, but he can not see them, and he says to the enticer: &#x201C;Now, tell me what you already told me privately before&#x201D;; if the seducer repeats it, the seducee replies to him, saying: &#x201C;How can we abandon our God in heaven, and go and worship wood and stone?&#x201D; If the seducer did repent, or remained silent, he is guiltless; but if he replies to him, saying: &#x201C;Such is our duty, and so it is becoming for us do&#x201D;, the two witnesses who stand from afar bring him before a tribunal and the pretence of stoning is pronounced against him.<sup><xref rid="fn267">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. It is mandatory that the hand of the seducee shall slay him, even as it is said: &#x201C;Thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death&#x201D; (Deut. 13.10). The seducee shall not be-friend the seducer, as it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt not consent unto him&#x201D;. Moreover, think not because it is said of thine enemy, &#x201C;Thou shalt surely release it with him&#x201D; (Ex. 23.5.) thou shalt also aid this one, remember to learn another saying: &#x201C;Nor hearken unto him&#x201D; (Deut. 13.10.); think not because it is said: &#x201C;Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbor&#x201D; (Lev. 19.16.), thou shalt also not stand idly by the blood of this one, remember to learn another saying: &#x201C;Neither shall thine eye pity him&#x201D; (Deut. 13. 9.). The seducee is forbidden to state aught in his favor, as it is said: &#x201C;Neither shalt thou spare&#x201D; (Ibid.). If he knew aught about his guilt, he is not permitted to be silent about it, as it is said: &#x201C;Neither shalt thou conceal him&#x201D; (Ibid.). Whence do we deduct the prohibitive against a layman who is an enticer? From what it is said: &#x201C;And all Israel shall hear, and fear&#x201D; (Ibid. 13.12.)<sup><xref rid="fn268">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. One who entices others to worship him, saying to them: &#x201C;Worship me&#x201D;, if they did worship him, he is stoned; but if they did not worship him, although they received his request attentively and said, Yes: he is not stoned. But if he enticed them to worship another man, or other kinds of idolatry, if they received his request attentively and said: &#x201C;Yes, we will go and worship&#x201D;, though no actual worship took place, both the enticer and the enticee are stoned, even as it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him&#x201D; (Ibid. 13.10); thus if he did hearken and consent, he is guilty.<sup><xref rid="fn269">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. How is a prophet, prophesying in the name of idolatry, proved to be such? It is he who says: &#x201C;That idol, or that star told me that it is mandatory to do thus and such, or not to do it,&#x201D; though he chanced to aim properly at the law, to contaminate that which is unclean and to purify that which is clean, if he received a warning before two witnesses, he is put to death by strangulation, even as it is said: &#x201C;Or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die&#x201D; (Deut. 18.20). The prohibitive against the practice of such a prophet is derived from what it is said: &#x201C;And make no mention of the name of other gods&#x201D; (Ex. 23. 13).<sup><xref rid="fn270">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. It is forbidden to enter into a disputation with one who prophesies in the name of idolatry, and he is not asked to bring a token or perform a miracle. If he does so of his own account, no attention should be paid to him and no afterthought given to it; and whosoever meditates about his tokens, lest they be true, violates a prohibitive commandment, saying: &#x201C;Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet&#x201D; (Deut. 13.4). So is the punishment of the false prophet by strangulation, though he be prophesying in the name of God and neither added to or diminished from the Torah, even as it is said: &#x201C;But the prophet, that shall speak a word presumptuously in My name&#x2026; that same prophet shall die&#x201D; (Deut. 18.20)<sup><xref rid="fn271">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. Whether one prophesies that which he heard not by vision of prophecy, or whether he overheard his fellow-prophet&#x2019;s words and says that they were spoken to him, and he is posing as a prophet therewith, is a false prophet, and his death is by strangulation.<sup><xref rid="fn272">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. He who witholds himself from pronouncing a sentence of death against a false prophet, because of the latter&#x2019;s qualities, seeing that he follows the ways of prophecy, violates a prohibitive commandment, saying: &#x201C;Thou shalt not be afraid of him&#x201D; (Deut. 18.22); likewise is the one witholding himself from testifying against him, or who is afraid of him and dreads his words, included among those who violate the commandment of, &#x201C;Thou shalt not be afraid of him. A false prophet is brought to trial only before a tribunal of Seventy-One.<sup><xref rid="fn273">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. He who vows by the name of idolatry, or swears by it, is lashed, even as it is said: &#x201C;And make no mention of other gods&#x201D; (Ex. 23.13), whether the oath be for himself or for the idolatry. It is forbidden to give an oath to idolater by that which he fears. Even to mention the name of the different kinds of idolatry is forbidden, though it be not in the manner of an oath, for it is said: &#x201C;Make no mention&#x201D; (Ibid.).<sup><xref rid="fn274">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. One man should not say to another: &#x201C;Wait for me alongside that idol, or like expression. But all forms of idolatry mentioned in Holy Writ one may name, for instance: Peor, Baal, Nebo, Gaad (Fortune) and the like. It is also forbidden to cause others to vow and take oath by the name of idolatry. But none is punished by lashes<sup><xref rid="fn275">11</xref></sup> save he who vows, or sustains himself, that is swears, by its name.<sup><xref rid="fn276">12</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER VI</h1>
<p>1. He who practices enchantry or spiritualism of his own free will, wantonly, is guilty of a sin punishable by excision; if there be witnesses, and he received due warning, he is stoned. If he erred, he should offer a standard sin-offering. How is enchantry practiced? One stands and burns a kind of incense<sup><xref rid="fn277">1</xref></sup> known to such practicioners, holding in his hand a myrtle-branch which he waves, the while uttering in a murmur words known to such practicioners, so that the supplicant thinks that he hears one conversing with him and answering his questions in words that appear to be coming from beneath the earth uttered in a very low voice, which is scarcely audible to the ear but rather perceptible to the mind. Or, one who holds a skull of a deceased person, and burns incense to it, and divines by it, so that it becomes evident as if an extremely low ventriloquous voice makes reply. All such are practices of enchantry, and whosoever practices one such, is stoned.<sup><xref rid="fn278">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. How is spiritualism practiced? One puts a bone of a bird known to such practicioners in his mouth, burns incense and performs other manipulations until he falls into a fit resembling epilepsy, when he speaks out of his mouth happenings of the future. All such are forms of idolatry. Whencefrom is the warning against such practices derived? From what it is said: &#x201C;Turn ye not unto the ghosts, nor unto familiar spirits&#x201D; (Lev. 19.31)<sup><xref rid="fn279">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. He who gives of his children to Molech of his own free will, wantonly, is guilty of an offense punishable by excision. If he erred, he should offer a standard sin-offering. But if he did not in the presence of witnesses, and was given due warning, his punishment is stoning; for, it is said: &#x201C;Whosoever&#x2026; that giveth of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death&#x201D; (Lev. 20.2). Whencefrom is the warning against him derived? From what it is said: &#x201C;And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to set them apart to Molech&#x201D; (Ibid. 18.21); and it is further said: &#x201C;There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire&#x201D; (Deut. 18.10). How was the practice thereof? One builds a big fire, and takes a part of his children and turns them over to the fire-worshiping priests; those priests, after a child had been turned over to them by the father to pass him through the fire by the father&#x2019;s consent, return the child back to the father, and it is the father of the child who passes his child through the fire by the consent of the priests, and the passing through thereof is by walking the victim from one side to the other in the midst of the flame. The practice was not to burn children to Molech outright after the manner of those who burned their sons and daughters to another kind of idolatry,<sup><xref rid="fn280">4</xref></sup> but only by passing through the flame was the service of this idol which is called Molech. Therefore, he who performs such service to another idol, save Molech, is not guilty of worshiping Molech.<sup><xref rid="fn281">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. He is not guilty of either excision or stoning, unless he handed over his child to Molech, and led him through the flame walking on his feet. If he handed him over and led him not through, or if he led him through and did not hand him over before, or if he handed him over but led him over not after the manner of leading, he is not guilty, Neither is he guilty unless he hands over only part of his children and leaves behind the rest; for, it is said: &#x201C;Because he hath given <italic>of</italic> his seed unto Molech&#x2014;<italic>of his seed</italic>, but not <italic>all of his seed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn282">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. Whether the seed be lawful or illicit, whether his own sons and daughters or their children and granchildren, even all that come forth out of his loins, because they are his seed, he is guilty; but if he led through his brothers, or his sisters, or his parents, or he permitted himself to be let through, he is not guilty. If he led through one of his children who was asleep, or blind, he is not guilty.<sup><xref rid="fn283">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. The pillar forbidden by the Torah, is a building where everybody assembles, even to serve God therein is forbidden, for in such manner was idolatry worshiped; for, it is said: &#x201C;Neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar&#x201D; (Deut. 16.22). And, whosoever sets up a pillar is lashed. The same applies to a figured stone spoken of in the Torah, although one bows down to it for the sake of God, he is lashed; for, it is said: &#x201C;Neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it&#x201D; (Lev. 26.1), because such was the practice of idolaters, to deposit a stone before it, upon which to bow down to it; therefore, shall it not be so in the worship of God. But he is not lashed, unless he spread his hands and feet upon the stone, so that he be bodily lying on it, for such is the kind of bowing down spoken of in the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn284">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. Whereat are these words directed? At other places, but in the Temple it is permitted to bow down on the stones, even as it is said: &#x201C;In your land&#x201D; (Lev. 26.1)&#x2014;in your land you shall not bow down upon the stones, but you do bow down upon the cut stones of the Temple. Because of this, it became the custom throughout Israel to spread matts, or straw, or stubble on the stone-laid flooring of the synagogues so as to separate their countenance, when they bow down, from the stone. If there could be found no substance to form a separation between himself and the stone, he should either go to another place and bow down, or bow sidewise, with his face turned away, so as not to connect his countenance with the stone.<sup><xref rid="fn285">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. Whosoever bows down to God upon the cut stones, without, however, spreading his hands and feet thereon, is not striped, but is lashed as a rebel; whereas idolatry, whether he bows down with spreading hands and feet or whether without spreading hands and feet, as long as he touches his countenance on the ground he is stoned.<sup><xref rid="fn286">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. He who plants a tree near the altar, or anywhere in the entire Court, whether a bare tree or a fruit tree, although he did it to adorn the Temple and beautify it, even such as he shall be striped; for, it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt not plant thee an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of the Lord thy God&#x201D; (Deut. 16.21), because this is the custom of idolaters; they plant trees beside the altar of the idol so as to attract the people to congregate there.<sup><xref rid="fn287">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. It is forbidden to make wooden entrance-passages in the Temple, such as are made in courtyards, the wood being built in and not planted, and the removal from the forbidden appearing to be overmuch, notwithstanding, because it is said: &#x201C;Any kind of tree&#x201D;(Ibid.). But all corridors<sup><xref rid="fn288">12</xref></sup> and cornices which were protruding from the walls of the Temple were of stone, not of wood.<sup><xref rid="fn289">13</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER VII</h1>
<p>1. It is a mandatory commandment to destroy idolatry, and everything used in its service, and everything that is made for its sake, even as it is said: &#x201C;Ye shall surely destroy all the places&#x201D; (Deut. 12.2), and it is, moreover, said: &#x201C;But thus shall ye deal with them&#x201D; (Ibid. 7.5). Within the boundaries of Eretz Yisrael it is mandatory to pursue it, until we destroy it from the whole of our land; but outside of Eretz Yisrael we are not commanded to pursue it, save that any place which we may conquer we should destroy idolatry therefrom, even as it is said: &#x201C;And ye shall destroy their name out of that place&#x201D; (Ibid. 12.3)&#x2014;in Eretz Yisrael thou art commanded to pursue them, but thou art not commanded to pursue them without Eretz Yisrael.<sup><xref rid="fn290">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Idolatry, its articles of service, that which is offered to it, and all that is made for its sake, nought thereof should be enjoyed, even as it is said: &#x201C;And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house&#x201D; (Ibid. 7.26); and whosoever enjoys aught of one of these is striped twice; once, because it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt not bring&#x201D; (Ibid.) and once more because it is said: &#x201C;And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thy hand&#x201D; (Ibid. 13.18).<sup><xref rid="fn291">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. It is forbidden to derive any profit of a cattle which was wholly sacrificed to idolatry, even its manure, bones, horns, hoofs and hide, of all and any no enjoyment shall be derived. Therefore, if there be a mark in the hide by which it is known that such hide is of a sacrifice to idolatry, for instance, they used to make a round cut opposite the heart in order to get the heart out, it is evident that all hides which are so cut are forbidden property to enjoy aught thereof, and so are all the like of this.<sup><xref rid="fn292">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. Wherein is the difference between an idol that belongs to an idolator and an idol that belongs to an Israelite? The idol of an idolater is forbidden property to enjoy aught thereof the moment it becomes an idol; it is said: &#x201C;The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire&#x201D; (Ibid. 7.25), the moment they became graven images it became a god to the idolater; but that of the Israelite does not become forbidden property until it is worshiped, as it is said: &#x201C;And setteth up in secret&#x201D; (Ibid. 27.15), until matters of secrecy will be done to it, which are its form of worship. But everything used in the service of idolatry, whether it belong to an idolator or to an Israelite, does not become forbidden property until they will be used during services to idolatry.<sup><xref rid="fn293">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. One who makes idols for others, though he is striped, may enjoy his wages, even if he made it for an idolater, which becomes forbidden property before worshiping it, because it does not become forbidden until it is completed, and the moment he gives the last stroke which finishes it his interest therein is not even a penny&#x2019;s worth. One who purchased antiques from an idolater and found idols therein, if he paid for it but took no delivery, he may return them to the idolater; likewise if he took delivery but did not pay for it, although delivery in dealing with an idolater consummates the deal, for here is an apparent purchase by mistake. If he gave money and took delivery, he must cast them in the dead sea. And so shall it be when an idolater and a proselyte fall heirs to the property of their idolatrous father; the proselyte may say to the idolater: &#x201C;You take the idols and I will take coin; you take compounded wine and I will take fruit&#x201D;. But after the forbidden articles came under control of the proselyte he is forbidden to make such exchange.<sup><xref rid="fn294">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. Figures made by an idolater for beauty&#x2019;s sake are permissive property, but figures made for idolatry are forbidden property. How can it be indentified? All figures found in the rural districts are forbidden property, because they are presumed to have been made for idolatry; and those that are found in urban districts, if they were placed at the gate of a city and there was alongside the figure an emblem of a rod, or bird, or globe, or sword, or wreath and ring the presumption is that it was dedicated to idolatry and is forbidden property, if none of these be there the presumption thereof is that it was for beauty&#x2019;s sake only and is permissive property.<sup><xref rid="fn295">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. Cast-away images of idolatry found on the streets, or among cast-off articles, are permissive property, needless to mention broken images; but if one finds a cast-away hand of a star or planet, or its foot or one of its limbs it is forbidden property, because he has certain knowledge that such member is from an idolatrous figure which is worshiped and, therefore, remains in its forbidden status until he find out that idolatrous worshipers made it impotent.<sup><xref rid="fn296">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. One who finds vestments with engravings of the sun and the moon and dragons thereon, if they be of silver, or gold, or tapestry, or if such were engraved upon nose-bands or rings they are forbidden property; but on all other kind of vestments it is permissive property as the presumption is that it is for beauty&#x2019;s sake. Likewise are all other images which are found on all kinds of vestments under the presumption of being there for beauty&#x2019;s sake, and it is permissive property.<sup><xref rid="fn297">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. Idolatry, everything used in its service, and everything that is made for its sake, even a particle thereof renders everything it is mingled with and its identity lost therein forbidden property. For example? An idol which was mixed up with figures of beauty, even one in many thousands, all of it must be cast in the Dead Sea. Likewise if a cup of idolatry was mixed up with many other cups, or a piece of idolatrous meat in many pieces of other meat must be cast in the Dead Sea. Likewise if a heart-cut hide was mixed up with many other hides, all become forbidden property. If one did transgress and sold idolatry, or an article used in its service, or that which is made for its sake, even the proceeds thereof is forbidden property and a particle thereof renders all other things wherewith it is mixed up forbidden property, for it is as idolatry itself, even as it is said: &#x201C;Nor take it unto thee, lest thou be desolate as itself&#x201D; (Deut. 7.25)<sup><xref rid="fn298">9</xref></sup>; herefrom you deduct that everything you take in from idolatry from the things which are for its service, and from that which it is made for its use is like unto itself.<sup><xref rid="fn299">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. The ashes of an idol or Asherah which was burned is forbidden property. A glowing ember of a burning idol is forbidden property, but the flame is permissive because it has no substance. Doubtful idolatry is forbidden property; a doubt contingent upon another doubt is permissive. For example? An idolatrous cup that fell in a receptacle full of cups all are forbidden property, because idolatry and the things made for its service, even a particle thereof disqualify all. If one cup from all with which the idolatrous cups was mixed up became separated and fell among two other cups all are permissive property. If a ring belonging to idolatry<sup><xref rid="fn300">11</xref></sup> became mixed up with many other rings, and then two of the lot fell overboard into the ocean, all the remaining are permissive property, for it can be said that the ring belonging to idolatry was one of the two which fell overboard. If it became mixed up with a hundred other rings, which were subsequently separated into two groups, forty in one place and sixty in another place, and the group of forty fell among a lot of other rings, all are permissive property, for it can be said that the forbidden ring is in the major group of sixty.<sup><xref rid="fn301">12</xref></sup> But if the sixty fell into a group of other rings all are forbidden property.<sup><xref rid="fn302">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. An Asherah, whether it was an object of worship itself, or whether there was an idol beneath it, the shadow of the full height of its stem is forbidden ground to sit under; but it is permitted to sit beneath the shadow of its branches and leaves. If one can avoid it by another road he is forbidden to pass beneath it, if there be no other road he should pass beneath it running.<sup><xref rid="fn303">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. Birds in a nest which are no longer in need of their mother are permissive property; but birds and eggs which need their mother<sup><xref rid="fn304">15</xref></sup> are forbidden property, seeing that the Asherah is the basis of their existence. The nest itself on its top<sup><xref rid="fn305">16</xref></sup> is permissive, because the bird brings his building material from another place.<sup><xref rid="fn306">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. If one took wood thereof, it is forbidden property; if he heated the hearth with it, it shall be cooled off and thereafter heated with other wood, when he may bake therein. If he did not cool it off and baked bread therein, the bread is forbidden property. If it be mixed up with other bread, he should cast the price of that bread in the Dead Sea and the other loaves are permissive property.<sup><xref rid="fn307">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. If he made a shuttlecock thereof and wove a garment therewith, that garment is forbidden property; if it be mixed up with other garments he shall cast the price of that garment into the Dead Sea and the rest of the garments are permissive property. It is permitted to plant vegetables beneath its shadow, whether it be in summer when the shadow is essential to it or in the rainy season, because the shadow of the Asherah, which is forbidden premises and the ground which does not become forbidden property, both cause such vegetables to sprout, and, it is a rule that whenever a forbidden thing and a permissive thing contribute jointly to a cause it is permissive everywhere. Therefore, if a field was fertilized with fertilizer which belonged to idolatry, it is permitted to be seeded; or if a cow was fattened with lentiles which belonged to idolatry it may be eaten, and so like thereto.<sup><xref rid="fn308">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. Meat, or wine, or fruit which one prepared to be offered to idolatry, do not become forbidden property, although he had already delivered it to the house of idolatry, not until he should offer it to the presence thereof. When he did offer it to the presence thereof, it becomes a thing made for the sacrifice thereto, and even though he take it out again, it is forbidden property forever. Moreover, everything which is found in a house of idolatry, even salt and water is forbidden property by the Torah, and whosoever partakes a particle thereof is lashed.<sup><xref rid="fn309">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. One who finds a garment or a vessel, or coin upon the head of an idol, if he finds it deposited in a shameful manner it is permissive property, but if he finds it deposited in an honorable manner it is forbidden property. For example? He found a bag hung about its neck, a folded garment lying upon its head, or a vessel leaning upon its head, that is permitted property, because it is there in a shameful manner; and so it is with all like thereto. If he found aught the like of which is used as sacrifice on the altar of the Temple, it is forbidden property. Whereat are these words directed? At things found without the place of its worship, but if he found it within, whether it be in an honorable manner or whether it be in a shameful manner, whether it be a thing fit for the altar or whether it be a thing unfit&#x2014;all that which is found within is forbidden property, even water and salt. As for Peor and Mercury, all that which is found with them, whether within or without is forbidden property. So are the stones of Mercury, even a stone apparently belonging thereto, is forbidden property.<sup><xref rid="fn310">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. If a house of idolatry owned a plunge or park it may be enjoyed if its priests derive no favor therefrom, but it should not be enjoyed if its priests do derive a favor therefrom; if it owned it jointly with others, it may be enjoyed even if its priests do derive a favor therefrom, save only nothing should be paid for it.<sup><xref rid="fn311">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. If there be an idol in a bath-house, it is permitted to bathe therein, because it was placed there for beauty&#x2019;s sake and not for worship, even as it is said: &#x201C;Their gods&#x201D; (Deut. 7. 16), when they conduct themselves toward them after the custom of godliness and when they shame it, for instance, this one which stands at the pool and everybody micturating before it. However, if its mode of service was such, it is forbidden to enter therein<sup><xref rid="fn312">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. If one slaughtered an animal with a knife used for idolatry, such animal is permissive property, because he inflicts a damage, If it was a dangerously sick cattle, it is forbidden property, because he repairs a possible loss therewith, and the repair is enjoyed from an instrument dedicated to the service of idolatry. It is likewise forbidden to cut meat therewith, because he repairs something; but if he cuts it in a manner to cause a loss, or as if destroying it, it is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn313">24</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER VIII</h1>
<p>1. All that which can not be seized by the hand of man, and man made it not, although it is being worshiped, is permissive property. Therefore, idolaters who worship mountains, hills, trees originally planted for fruit-production, public springs, or cattle, all such are permissive property, and the fruit worshiped at the place of its growth, and such cattle may be eaten; needless to say that a cattle designated to idolatry may be eaten, regardless of whether it was designated to be worshiped or sacrificed, for such is permissive property. Whenceonward is it said that a cattle does not become forbidden property? Prior to any act done to it in the name of idolatry; but after the least act was done to it, it becomes forbidden thereby. For example? If he severed one of its carotides in the name of idolatry. If he made barter therewith to use the proceeds thereof for idolatry, he made it forbidden property, and so is also the proceeds out of that barter, because it becomes the capital of idolatry. Whereat are these words directed? At his own cattle<sup><xref rid="fn314">1</xref></sup>; but if he slaughtered his neighbor&#x2019;s cattle to idolatry, or exchanged it, it does not become forbidden property, because no man can make forbidden property out of something which is not his. One who bows down to ownerless land, does not make it forbidden property; if he dug therein wells, pits, or caves to the worship of idolatry, it does become forbidden property.<sup><xref rid="fn315">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Water carried out of a stream by a wave,<sup><xref rid="fn316">3</xref></sup> if one bows down to it, he does not make it forbidden property; if he take out the water by his hand and bows down to it, he does make it forbidden property. Stones of a mountain which became loosened and one worshiped them at their original place, are permissive property, as there was no seizure of man&#x2019;s hand on them.<sup><xref rid="fn317">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. If an Israelite placed a brick erect to bow down to it but did not bow down to it, and then came an idolater and did bow down to it, he made it forbidden property, as placing it erect is an overt act. Likewise if he place an egg erect and an idolator came and bowed down to it, he made it forbidden property. If he cut a pumpkin, or its like, and bowed down to it, he made it forbidden property. If he bowed down to one half of a pumpkin<sup><xref rid="fn318">5</xref></sup> and the other half is connected thereto even that half is forbidden property, because of the peradventure, lest this half serves as a base for the half which is the object of worship. A tree which was originally planted to be worshiped, is forbidden property; of such is the Asherah mentioned in the Torah. If a planted tree was cut down and dedicated to the name of idolatry, though he propagated its trunk by grafting and crossing and it budded and branches grew upon it, he merely cuts off the branches, which are forbidden property, but the rest of the tree is permissive property. Likewise is a tree worshiped by an individual, although its trunk did not become forbidden property, all branches, leaves, boughs and fruit which it brings forth as long as it is worshiped are forbidden property. A tree, the fruit of which was guarded by idolaters, saying that they are preparing to make thereof strong drink for a given house of idolatry, and they do make strong drink thereof and drink it on their holiday, is forbidden property, because it is plain that it is an Asherah, for they therefore treat its fruit in such manner, as that is the method of the Asherah.<sup><xref rid="fn319">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. A tree, beneath which an idol is erected, as long as it is beneath it, it is forbidden property; if it be removed from beneath it it becomes permissive property, because it is not the tree itself which is worshiped. A house which was originally built by idolaters for the sake of worshiping it, and similarly if a built house is worshiped, it is forbidden property. If a built house was plastered and decorated anew and dedicated to the name of idolatry, all that which was added to it for its renovation may be removed, and the material thereof is forbidden property because it was made for the purpose of worship, but the rest of the house is permissive property. If one brings an idol into a house, as long as it is there, the house is forbidden property; if he removed it the house becomes permissive property. Likewise is a stone, originally hewn to worship it, forbidden property. If the stone was hewn, and thereafter it was tattooed and painted for worship, even if the tattooing and decorating were done on the body of the stone itself, the renovation may be removed, and that is forbidden property as it was made for the sake of worship, but the rest of the stone is permissive property.<sup><xref rid="fn320">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. A stone whereupon an idol was placed, as long as it remains upon it, it is forbidden property; if the stone was removed from thereunder, it becomes permitted property. If a house near a house of idolatry fell in, its owner, is forbidden to reconstruct it. What can he do to save his property? He moves on his own line and builds his house, and the space between he either fills in with thistles or makes a lavatory thereon, so as not to yield space to a house of idolatry. If the wall was of joint ownership the law of half and half should be applicable thereto, his half is permitted property and that of the idolatry is forbidden property, including everything, even its stones, wood, sand and all accessories thereof is forbidden property.<sup><xref rid="fn321">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. How is one to destroy idolatry and all other property forbidden on its account, such as things made for its service or for offerings thereto? He either pulverizes it and strews it to the wind, or burns it and casts the ashes into the Dead Sea.<sup><xref rid="fn322">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. Something which no human hand can seize that was worshiped, for instance mountains, cattle, or tree, although the object itself is permitted property, the decoration thereof is forbidden property, and whosoever enjoys aught thereof is striped; for it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt not covet the silver or gold that is on them&#x201D; (Deut. 7.25). And, all decorations of idolatry are included among the things made for its service.<sup><xref rid="fn323">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. An idol, the owner whereof was an idolater, which was nullified by him before it came into possession of an Israelite, even such is permitted property; for, it is said: &#x201C;The graven images of <italic>their gods</italic> shall ye burn with fire&#x201D; (Ibid.); such shall be done when they reach our hands as they follow the custom of <italic>godliness</italic> toward them; but if they were nullified by them they are permitted property.<sup><xref rid="fn324">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. An idol, the owner whereof is an Israelite, can never be nullified, even when an idolator had a partnership therein will his nullification be of no aid, but it remains forbidden property forever, and must be hidden. Likewise an idol, the owner whereof was an idolator, which came into the hand of an Israelite, after which the idolater nullified it, his nullification is of no aid but it remains forbidden property forever. An Israelite can not nullify idols, even with the consent of an idolater. An infant, or insane idolater can not nullify idols. An idolater, who nullified an idol, whether it was his own or the property of another idolater, under duress, though it be an Israelite who forced him thereto, the nullification stands, provided, however, that the idolater who nullified be himself a worshiper of idols, for the nullification of him who does not worship idols himself is no nullification. One who nullifies an idol its paraphernalia, too, is nullified; but if he nullifies its paraphernalia, they are permitted property but the idol itself is forbidden property as theretofore until he will nullify it. That which was designated as offering to idolatry can never be nullified.<sup><xref rid="fn325">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. How does the idolater nullify it? If he cut off the tip of its nose, the tip of its ear, the first joint of its finger, or if he squeezed in its face though he diminished it not, or if he sold it to a goldsmith who is an Israelite, such are acts of nullification. But if he pawned it, or sold it to an idolater, or to an Israelite who is not a goldsmith, or if debris fell upon it and he did not clean it, or if robbers stole it and he made no effort to recover it; if he expectorated before it, or micturated before it; dragged it, or cast feces at it, such are not acts of nullification.<sup><xref rid="fn326">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. An idol whose worshipers abandoned it at a time of peace is permitted property, for it is evident that they nullified it; but in war time it is forbidden property, because they did not abandon it save on account of the war. An idol which was broken of itself, its fragments are forbidden property until it will be nullified. Therefore, whosoever finds fragments of idols must know that they are forbidden property, lest the idolator did not nullify it. If the fragments consisted of joints and a non-artisan can restore them, each and every joint needs nullification, but if he can not replace,<sup><xref rid="fn327">14</xref></sup> as soon as one of its joints was nullified all fragments were nullified.<sup><xref rid="fn328">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. An altar of idolatry which was damaged, continues to be forbidden property until most of it will be demolished by the hand of an idolator; if a pedestal was damaged it becomes permitted property. What is a pedestal and what is an altar? A pedestal is made of one stone, and an altar of many stones. How are Mercury stones nullified? As soon as they were used as material in a building, or plastered roads with them, or other like utilization, they become permitted property. How is an Asherah nullified? If he lops off a leaf or casts away a twig, or takes cane or rod therefrom, or if he pruned it when it had no need for it, such do nullify it. If he pruned it for its own sake, it remains forbidden property but its prunning is permitted property. If it belong to an Israelite, whether it was its own sake or not for its own sake, both it and its prunning are forever forbidden property, because no idol owned by an Israelite can ever be nullified<sup><xref rid="fn329">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IX</h1>
<p>1. Three days before an idolaters&#x2019; holiday it is forbidden to either buy from or sell to them any article which is endurable; to either loan from or lend to them; to receive payment from or make payment to them on loans which were either secured by note or pledge; but a verbal loan may be collected from them, because it is as if he saves it from their clutches. It is permitted to sell them perishable goods, such as vegetables and cooked food, till their holiday. Whereat are these words spoken of? In Eretz Yisrael, but in other lands it is not forbidden to do all these save on their holiday itself. If one transgressed and did all these transections with them during the three forbidden days, the proceeds may be enjoyed; but he who deals with them on their holiday the proceeds thereof is forbidden to enjoy.<sup><xref rid="fn330">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. One is forbidden to send a present to a Samaritan (Kuti) on his holiday, unless it is known of him that he does not profess idolatry nor worship it. Likewise, if a Samaritan, on his holiday, sent a present to an Israelite, he should not accept it from him; if he fears enmity, he may take it, if the Samaritan is present, but he should not enjoy it until he will be informed that this Samaritan does not worship idolatry, nor profess it.<sup><xref rid="fn331">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. If the holiday of a particular group of idolaters lasted many days, even three, or four or ten days, all such days are to be considered as one day, and thereon and on the three days preceding it dealing with the idolaters is forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn332">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. The day on which idolaters congregate to appoint a king, and they offer sacrifices and give praise to their gods, is holy time to them, and is, like the rest of their holidays, forbidden time to deal with them. But an individual idolater, who appoints a day as holy time to himself,<sup><xref rid="fn333">4</xref></sup> and confesses to his star, and praises it on his birthday, or the day he shaves his beard or his queue, or the day he landed from an ocean trip, or when he is liberated from a dungeon, or the day he made a feast for his son, or like festivals, only on that particular day and with the particular idolater is it forbidden to have any dealings. Likewise the funeral day on the demise of one of them they make a holiday, on that particular day, with those particular people it is forbidden to deal. After every demise when vestures are burned and incense offered it is indicative that there is idolatrous worship connected therewith. No holiday is forbidden time save in so far its worshipers are concerned. But those who participate in its joyousness, and eat and drink and observe it as a custom or in honor of the king, yet they themselves do not profess it, with such it is permitted to deal.<sup><xref rid="fn334">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. Things which are of particular services to a particular kind of idolatry in a given territory are forever forbidden goods to be sold to such worshipers of such idolatry in such given territory. Things which are not of particular service to it, should be sold simply as merchandise. If the idolater mentions that he makes purchases of such things for idolatry, it is forbidden to sell it to him, unless it was rendered unfit to be offered to idolatry, because no favor should be offered to idolatry.<sup><xref rid="fn335">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. If specified things were mixed together with non-specified, for instance pure frankincense with black frankincense, one may sell simply as merchandise, without fearing lest he separates the pure frankincese for idolatry; and so in every like thing.<sup><xref rid="fn336">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. Even as it is forbidden to sell to idolaters things which uphold their hands to idolatry so it is forbidden to sell them things wherein there is a menace to the public, for instance, bears, lions, weapons, iron fetters, and chains; it is likewise forbidden to sharpen their weapons for them. And, everything which is forbidden to sell to an idolater is also forbidden to sell to an Israelite who is under suspicion that he might resell it to an idolater. It is likewise forbidden to sell instruments of harm to robbers who profess to be Israelites.<sup><xref rid="fn337">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. Israelites living among idolatrous neighbors, with whom they made a covenant of peace, are permitted to sell weapons to the king&#x2019;s servants and militia, because they conduct war therewith against the country&#x2019;s enemies to save it, as a consequence whereof they protect the Israelites who dwell among them. A city wherein there is an established house of idolatry,<sup><xref rid="fn338">9</xref></sup> one is permitted to pass by it without its boundaries, but is forbidden to enter it; if the idolatry is established without its boundaries he may enter it.<sup><xref rid="fn339">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. A traveller is forbidden to pass through a city wherein there is an established house of idolatry. That is to say, when the road is the only one leading to that place; but if there is another road<sup><xref rid="fn340">11</xref></sup> and he merely chanced to take this one, he is permitted to enter it.<sup><xref rid="fn341">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. It is forbidden to assist an idolater in building a shrine wherein the idol is kept; if he transgressed and did build, his wages is permitted property. But he may build the palace or courtyard where the shrine is without scruple.<sup><xref rid="fn342">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. A city wherein there is an established house of idolatry, and therein be decorated shops and non-decorated, of all that there is in the decorated shops it is forbidden to enjoy aught, because the presumption is that they were decorated for the sake of the idolatry; but of the non-decorated it is permitted to enjoy. It is forbidden to lease shops belonging to idolatry, because thereby one patronizes idolatry.<sup><xref rid="fn343">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. One who sells a house<sup><xref rid="fn344">15</xref></sup> to convert it into a house of idolatry, the proceeds thereof is forbidden property, and he should cast it into the Dead Sea. But if idolaters belabored an Israelite and robbed his house and erected an idol therein, he may file a written complaint against them in the idolatrous courts and the proceeds thereof, when he collects on them, is permitted property<sup><xref rid="fn345">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. It is forbidden to play a funeral march on the flutes used by idolaters. It is permitted to visit the Fair of idolaters, to buy from them cattle, slaves, maidservants in their idolatrous state, houses, fields and vineyards, and employ the scribes of and file suits in the idolatrous courts to enforce contracts with them, for it means escape from their power. That is saying, when the purchase is made from a private owner who pays no tax to idolatry, but to make purchase from one of their merchants is forbidden, because they do pay taxes, and the taxes goes to idolatry, as a result of which idolatry is patronized. If he transgressed and did buy from a merchant, if it was a cattle he shall sever its arteries from the knee-joints down,<sup><xref rid="fn346">17</xref></sup> and if it be garments or utensils let it decay. If he purchased money and metal utensils he shall cast it in the Dead Sea. If he purchased a slave, he should neither be aided from nor cast into a pit.<sup><xref rid="fn347">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. It is forbidden to partake of a wedding feast which an idolater makes for his son or his daughter; even to eat or drink one&#x2019;s own is forbidden to an Israelite, as it would be eating in company of idolaters. Whenceonward is it forbidden to eat with such an idolater? From the commencement of preparation for the feast, the entire duration of the feast, and thirty days thereafter. If the idolater make a special feast in honor of such nuptials, even after the lapse of thirty days, it is forbidden to eat with him until the lapse of twelve months. All this distant separation is ordained because of idolatry, even as it is said: &#x201C;And one call thee, and thou art of his sacrifice. And lest thou take of his daughters unto thy sons&#x2026;. and when his daughters go astray after their gods&#x201D; (Ex. 34.15&#x2013;16).<sup><xref rid="fn348">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. A daughter of Israel shall not nurse a son of an idolater, because she is rearing a son for idolatry; neither act as midwife to a idolatrous alien woman, though she may act as such for hire to prevent prejudice. An idolatrous alien woman may act as midwife to a daughter in Israel and nurse her son, provided the daughter in Israel gives her consent to it, lest the idolatrous woman murder her son.<sup><xref rid="fn349">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. With those who are going to services at the idolatrous houses it is forbidden to deal, but with those who are returning from services it is permitted to deal, provided they come not locked in their arms, for if they do appear so it is indicative that they intend yet to return. An Israelite who is going to a house of idolatry it is permitted to deal with him, perhaps he will repent; but when he returns therefrom it is forbidden. With a converted Jew it is forbidden to deal whether going or returning.<sup><xref rid="fn350">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. An Israelite who went to an idolatrous Fair it is forbidden to deal with him when he is returning, lest he sold idols there, and the proceeds of idolatry in the hand of an Israelite is forbidden property; but the proceeds of idolatry in the hand of an idolater is permitted property, wherefor it is permitted to deal with an idolater upon his return from the worship-places of idolatry. No business is transacted with an Israelite who returns from such idolatrous places, and with a converted Israelite neither when going to nor upon his return from such places.<sup><xref rid="fn351">22</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER X.</h1>
<p>1. It is forbidden to make a covenant of peace with the seven Canaanite nations, such peace as would permit them to continue the worship of idolatry, even as it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt not make any covenant with them&#x201D; (Deut. 7.2). They shall either repent themselves of their worship, or be slain. It is moreover, forbidden to have mercy upon them, as it is said: &#x201C;Nor show mercy unto them&#x201D; (Ibid.). Therefore, if one saw one of them lost or drowning, he should not bring him up; if he sees him dying, he should not save him; but to destroy wantonly or to push him into a pit, or the like is forbidden, as long as he wages no war. That is saying concerning the Seven Canaanite nations; but as for informers and infidels of those times the war was to destroy them by one&#x2019;s own hand and to lower them to the nethermost pit of destruction because they persecuted Israel, and turned the people from following God.<sup><xref rid="fn352">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Herefrom you are instructed that it is forbidden to give medical aid to an idolater even for hire. But if the doctor feared them, or if he feared their enmity, he may give them aid for hire, but free aid is forbidden. An alien inhabitant among the idolaters, because it is mandatory to afford him a living, the doctor may give free treatment.<sup><xref rid="fn353">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. No houses or fields shall be sold to them in Eretz Yisrael, but in Syria houses may be sold to them but not fields. It is permitted to lease houses to them in Eretz Yisrael, provided no idolatrous settlement is established by them, and no settlement is considered such if there are no three houses therein; but it is forbidden to lease fields unto them. In Syria it is permitted to lease to them fields too. Wherefore has a field been considered the major? Because therein are found two reasons: (a) the idolater removes the obligation of tithes therefrom, and (b) the Israelite shows mercy in giving land to an idolater. But an Israelite who owns land without Eretz Yisrael may sell them there both, house and fields, because it is not the Promised Land.<sup><xref rid="fn354">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. Even in the places where the leasing of houses to them is permitted, it is not for dwelling purposes that the permission was granted, as it would bring the abomination of idolatry into it, against which it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt bring no abomination into thy house&#x201D; (Deut. 7.26); but one may lease houses to<sup><xref rid="fn355">4</xref></sup> them for storage. It is forbidden to sell them fruit on the trees, or grain on the stalk; but he may sell it after it be harvested, or sell to one on condition that he harvest it, and when he does harvest it the purchase is binding. But wherefore is it forbidden to sell it to them? Because it is said: &#x201C;Nor show mercy unto them&#x201D; (Ibid. 7.2)&#x2014;given them no permanency on land, for by having no land their settlement will be but a temporary one.<sup><xref rid="fn356">5</xref></sup> It is also forbidden to speak in praise of idolatry, even to say: &#x201C;How beautiful is this idol&#x2019;s facial features&#x201D;. From this minor premise the major premise can be deducted that it is forbidden to speak in praise of the performance of idolatry, or to love any of its parts even as it is said: &#x201C;Nor show mercy unto them&#x201D; (Ibid.), they should have no grace in thine eyes,<sup><xref rid="fn357">6</xref></sup> for it will be a cause to cleave to it and learn its evil deeds. It is, moreover, forbidden to give them a present outright, but it is permitted to give a present outright to an alien sojourner, even as it is said: &#x201C;Unto the stranger that is in thy gates canst thou give it, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien&#x201D; (Deut.14. 21.) &#x2014; to an alien by selling it to him, and not by presenting it to him.<sup><xref rid="fn358">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. The poor of among the idolaters are supported alike with the poor of Israel as a peaceful measure. The idolatrous poor should not be disturbed when gathering the gleanings, or a forgotten sheaf from, or the corners of the field, also as a peaceful measure.<sup><xref rid="fn359">8</xref></sup>. It is also proper to greet them, even on their holiday, as a measure of peace, Never should the greetings be repeated twice, or call in the house of an idolater on his holiday to extend greetings to him. When meeting him on the street, greetings should be extended to him softly and seriously.<sup><xref rid="fn360">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. All of these liberal treatments are not ordained save when Israelites are sojourning among idolaters or when the idolaters have overpowered Israel in his own land; but if the government of his land be in his own hand, it is forbidden to permit idolaters to settle therein, for even<sup><xref rid="fn361">10</xref></sup> if one of them merely desires to sojourn or pass from place to place with merchandise he must not pass through Eretz Yisrael before he obligates himself to live up to the seven Noaitic commandments,<sup><xref rid="fn362">10</xref></sup> even as it is said: &#x201C;They shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin against Me&#x201D; (Ex. 23.33)&#x2014;not even dwell therein temporarily. If an idolater obligated himself to observe the Seven Noaitic commandments he is a sojourning alien. The tribunal does not accept a sojourning alien save during the Jubilee year, but during the interval<sup><xref rid="fn363">11</xref></sup> none save a just proselyte is accepted.<sup><xref rid="fn364">12</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER XI</h1>
<p>1. It is forbidden to follow the customs of the idolaters, or to imitate them neither in dress nor in hair-trimming and like customs, for it is said: &#x201C;And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation which I cast out before you&#x201D; (Lev. 20.23), and it is also said: &#x201C;And in their customs shall ye not walk&#x201D; (Ibid. 18.3), and it is, moreover, said: Then take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them&#x201D; (Deut. 12.30)&#x2014;all of which pertain to one subject admonishing them not to be like unto them. Forsooth an Israelite shall be separated from them, and be recognized by his clothes and in his conduct as he is different than they are in education and tendencies. For even so it is said: &#x201C;And have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be Mine&#x201D; (Lev. 20.26). An Israelite shall not wear a garment of a design particularly adopted by idolaters, nor raise hair-locks as their hair-locks; not shave the sides and leave the hair in the middle, such as is called a queue, nor shave the hair opposite his face, from ear to ear, and leave the locks at the back of his head as they do. He shall not build public places<sup><xref rid="fn365">1</xref></sup> of the same design and architecture as are the palaces built for idolatry in order to attract a crowd as they do.<sup><xref rid="fn366">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. An Israelite, giving a hair cut to an idolater, should refrain from cutting the hair within three inches of his queue.<sup><xref rid="fn367">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. An Israelite of an idolatrous king&#x2019;s circle, who must sit in council together with their kings, and he feels ashamed to appear different than they, may wear their kind of clothes and shave opposite his face as they do.<sup><xref rid="fn368">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. It is forbidden to practice enchantment as the idolaters do, even as it is said: &#x201C;Nor shall ye use enchantment&#x201D; (Ibid. 19.26). How is enchantment practiced? For instance, those who say: &#x201C;Seeing that the bread fell out of my mouth&#x201D;, or, &#x201C;my cane fell out of my hand I shall not go to-day to that place, for if I do go, my desire will not be fulfilled; seeing that a fox passed by my right hand I shall not leave my door step to-day, for if I do leave a false person will encounter me&#x201D;. Likewise those who hear the chirping of a bird say: &#x201C;It will be so, but not so; it is good to do that thing and bad to do the other thing&#x201D;. So are those who say: &#x201C;Kill this rooster, he crowed during the evening; kill that hen, she crows like a rooster&#x201D;. So, too, is one who sets certain signs<sup><xref rid="fn369">5</xref></sup> for himself to regulate his actions, saying: &#x201C;If such thing will come to pass I shall do that thing, but if it will not come to pass I shall not do it&#x201D;, even as Eliezer, Abrahams servant did. And so are all like practices of such things forbidden. And whosoever commits an act as a result of any one of such practices, is lashed.<sup><xref rid="fn370">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. One who said: &#x201C;This dwelling which I built was of good prefigurement, this wife of mine which I betrothed was a blessing to me, this cattle which I purchased brought wealth to me&#x201D;, and, likewise, one who asks a child, What Verse art thou studying? if he mentioned to him a Verse of the blessings, he may rejoice and say: &#x201C;This is of good omen&#x201D;. All such and the like is permitted;<sup><xref rid="fn371">7</xref></sup> seeing that he neither regulated his actions nor withheld himself from performing them by these signs, save that he made for himself a mark of a thing which already had come to pass, observe, this is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn372">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. Who is practitioner of divination? He who occupies himself with purposeless actions so as to divert his thoughts from all relevancy, thereby preparing himself to prognosticate, and, then, foretells, saying: &#x201C;That thing will come to pass,&#x201D; or, &#x201C;it will not come to pass&#x201D;, or he will say: &#x201C;It is proper to do so, but beware from doing otherwise.&#x201D; There are some soothsayers who use sand or stones as a medium, and there others who spread themselves out on the ground and fall in convulsions and cry out; there are some who look into an iron mirror or goblet and imagine things and say them, and there are others who carry a cane in hand upon which to lean, wherewith a process of knocking is continued as a diversion until the mind is ready, then the speaking starts. Upon such the prophet proclaims, saying: &#x201C;My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them&#x201D; (Hosea, 4. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn373">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. It is forbidden to practice divination or ask counsel of a soothsayer; only the consultant of a soothsayer is punished after the manner of a rebel, but the soothsayer himself, if he committed an overt act of any of its practices or their like, is striped, in accordance with what it is said: &#x201C;There shall not be found among you one who useth divination&#x201D; (Deut. 18.10).<sup><xref rid="fn374">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. Who is an observer of times? They that point at times, saying astrologically: &#x201C;That day is a good one, that day is a bad one; that day is fit to do that particular work, but that year, or that month, is bad for that particular thing.<sup><xref rid="fn375">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. It is forbidden to be an observer of times, though no act be committed, save to make known the lies to such fools who believe them to be true speech of the wise. Moreover, he who does aught because of the signs of astrology, and times to do his work or go on his mission on the very time, set by the heaven-gazers, even he is striped, for it is said: &#x201C;Nor observe times&#x201D; (Lev. 19. 26).<sup><xref rid="fn376">12</xref></sup> Likewise, one who deludes the eyes by performing some act alleging it to be wonderful, but in truth makes no performance at all, even he is included among observers of time, and his punishment is stripes.</p>
<p>10. Who is a charmer? He who utters words which are not of the vernacular of the people, and which have no significance but supposes in his credulous mind that those words are of help, until others are led to say; &#x201C;If he pronounces thus and such against a serpent or against a scorpion it will not harm; and if he says such and thus against fire it will do no damage&#x201D;. Among them there is such who, while talking holds in his hand a key, or a rock; such and other similar artifice the whole of it is forbidden. As for the charmer himself, either if he held aught in his hand, or if he committed any act along with his utterance, even if he merely pointed with his finger, is striped, as it is said: &#x201C;There shall not be found among thee.&#x2026; Or a charmer (Deut. 18.10&#x2013;11). But if he merely uttered his prattle, and moved neither hand nor head, holding nothing in his hand; and so the individual, over whom he delivered himself of those noises, who sits before him and appears to derive joy of the performance, should be punished as a rebel because he became a party to the silliness of the charmer. All such chatter and ridiculously obscene nomenclature are harmless but without the least good about them.</p>
<p>11. For one who was bitten by a scorpion or sneak it is permitted to charm cunningly upon the injured spot, even on the Sabbath, so as to compose the mind of the patient and strengthen his heart, although the thing is of no help yet because the patient is in a dangerous condition it is permitted for his sake to prevent his mind from being disconcerted.<sup><xref rid="fn377">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. He who delivers a prayer of charm upon a wound and reads also a verse of the Torah thereon, likewise one who reads a Verse so that a babe shall suffer no fear, or who puts a Sepher Torah or phylacteries upon a child so that he might fall asleep, such are not alone included among the enchanters and charmers but are even included among those who deny the Torah, for they are employing the words of the Torah as a cure for the body, whereas they are not so but only remedies for the soul<sup><xref rid="fn378">14</xref></sup> even as it is said: &#x201C;And they will (shall) be life for thy soul&#x201D; (Pro. 3.22). But a normally healthy person who reads Verses of the Torah or chapters of the Psalms, so that the righteousness of reading it shield him to escape suffering and accidents, lo, this is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn379">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. Who is a necromancer? He who starves himself and then proceeds to lodge on the cemetery so as to bring the dead up in his dream and make known to him what he would ask him for. And there are others who clothe themselves with certain garments, utter certain words, and burn certain incense, and sleep alone so that a certain deceased person come to converse with him in his dream. As a general rule in this matter: Whosoever commits an overt act in order to have the dead come and give him information is striped, for it is said: &#x201C;There shall not be found among you&#x2026;. or a necromancer&#x201D; (Deut. 18.10&#x2013;11).<sup><xref rid="fn380">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. It is forbidden to consult a solicitor of ghosts or a solicitor of familiar spirits, for it is said: &#x201C;There shall not be found among you&#x2026;. or one that consulteth a ghost or a familiar spirit&#x201D; (Ibid.). Find thyself instructed that a solicitor of ghosts or a solicitor of familiar spirits, themselves suffer the punishment of stoning, but their communicant violates an admonition who is punished after the manner of a rebel, unless he appointed his actions and did according to their charge, when he is striped<sup><xref rid="fn381">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. A sorcerer is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning, provided he committed an overt act of witchery but if he merely deludes the eyes by make-believe action which in reality is but juggling he is punished after the manner of a rebel, seeing that the prohibitive commandment against sorcery is included in the charge of, &#x201C;There shall not be found among you etc.&#x201D; (Ibid.), which is a prohibitive devoted to admonish those who are put to death by a tribunal for the violation of which no stripes is inflicted, and that the punishment for an overt act is death is deducted from what it is said: &#x201C;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live&#x201D; (Ex. 22.17)<sup><xref rid="fn382">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. All of these things are false and spurious, and it was with such that the ancient idolaters misled the peoples of many lands so that they be following them. And it is unbecoming to Israel who are exceedingly wise to be attracted by these absurdities, nor to even imagine that they are of any consequence, even as it is said: &#x201C;For there is no enchantment with Jacob, neither is there any divination with Israel&#x201D; (Num. 23.23); and it is again said: &#x201C;For these nations that thou art to dispossess, hearken unto soothsayers and unto diviners, but as for thee the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee so to do&#x201D; (Deut. 18.14). Whosoever believes in these matters, and their like, and suppose that there is wisdom and truth in in them, save that the Torah disallowed them, such are none other save from among the foolish and ignorant and are to be included among women and children whose mind is not sound. But wise and sound-minded people know that all these matters which the Torah disallowed are not matters of wisdom but formless nonsense followed by senseless people for the sake of which they abandoned every path of truth. Even because thereof the Torah, in admonishing against all these vanities, commanded, saying: &#x201C;Perfect shalt thou be with the Lord thy God&#x201D; (Ibid. 18.13).<sup><xref rid="fn383">19</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER XII</h1>
<p>1. It is forbidden to round the corners of the head, as the idolaters used to do, even as it is said: &#x201C;Ye shall not round the corners of your head&#x201D; (Lev. 19.27). Guilt is attached to the rounding of each corner; therefore, if one shaves the corners of both sides of his head even at one time, and after only one warning, is striped twice. Regardless of whether one shaves the corners and leaves the hair of the whole head, or whether he shaves the hair of the entire head at one time, he is striped, seeing that he shaved the corners. That is saying concerning the male barber, but the male who is shaved<sup><xref rid="fn384">1</xref></sup> is not striped unless he aided the barber. One who rounds the corners of an infant is striped.<sup><xref rid="fn385">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. A woman barber who shaved the corners of the head of a man, or had her own corners rounded is not guilty, for it is said: &#x201C;Ye shall not round the corners of your head, neither shalt thou destroy the corners of thy beard&#x201D; (Ibid.)&#x2014;whosoever is concerned with regard to destroying the beard is also concerned with rounding of the corners, but a woman not being concerned with regard to destroying, having no beard, is, therefore, not concerned with regard to rounding the corners. Wherefor, servants because they have a beard, are forbidden to round.<sup><xref rid="fn386">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. Both men and woman are obliged to observe all of the prohibitive commandments in the Torah, save destroying a beard, rounding the corners of the head, and a priest&#x2019;s contamination for the dead which refer only to men; and, pertaining to mandatory commandments, every such commandment the performance of which takes place only at stated times, and not continuously women are exempted, save the sanctification of the Sabbath day with words of prayer, eating of Mazzah on the first (two) night(s) of Passover, the eating of the Paschal lamb, its slaughter, to be present when all Israel assemble once in seven years, and rejoicing on the festivals wherein women&#x2019;s participation is obligatory.<sup><xref rid="fn387">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. A gynander and androgyne, beings of doubtful sex, have the major responsibilities of both, men and women, of all commandments and are obliged to observe them all; nevertheless, if they violate any of them no stripes are inflicted.<sup><xref rid="fn388">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. Although a woman may round the corners of her own head,<sup><xref rid="fn389">6</xref></sup> she is forbidden to shave the corners of a man&#x2019;s head, even that of a minor.<sup><xref rid="fn390">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. For this lock, which must be left at the corners of the head, the scholars designated no particular size, but we did hear from our elders that one should not leave less than forty (four) hairs. It is permitted, however, to clip the corners with a pair of scissors, for the prohibitive commandment applies only against destroying it with a razor.<sup><xref rid="fn391">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. It was the custom of the idolatrous priests to destroy their beards, because of this the Torah disallowed to destroy the beard. There are five corners (locks) in the beard: (1) upper cheek, (2) lower cheek on the right side; (3) upper and (4) lower cheeks on the left side, and (5) the stem of the beard. For destroying each and every one of the corners, the punishment is lashes; thus if he destroyed all of them at one time he is lashed five times. No guilt is carried with respect thereto unless he destroyed it with a razor, even as it is said: &#x201C;Neither shalt thou destroy the corners of thy beard. Therefore if one should mar his beard with a pair of scissors he is not guilty. The one who is shaved is not guilty unless he assisted in the work. A woman is permitted to destroy her beard, if she has a growth of hair on her chin. If she shaved the beard of a man, she is not guilty.<sup><xref rid="fn392">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. It is permitted to shave the mustache, that is the hair on the upper lip; likewise the hanging hair off the lower lip; nevertheless, it is not the custom of Israel to shave it, but to trim its ends so as not to inconvenience eating or drinking.<sup><xref rid="fn393">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. The removal of hair from other parts of the body, as from beneath the arms and organic region, is not forbidden by the Torah but by edicta of the Scribes, and the one who mars it is punished after the manner of a rebel. That is saying concerning a district where only women are practicing it, to prevent men from imitating the practice of women; but in a district where both men and women resort to the practice, no punishment is meted out to men therefor. It is permitted to remove the hair with a pair of scissors from all other limbs.<sup><xref rid="fn394">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. A women shall not adorn herself with man&#x2019;s adornment, such as a mitre, or a helmet, or a coat of armor, and the like, or cut the hair of her head man-fashion; neither shall a man adorn himself with the adornment of a women, for instance to wear loud-colored garments or golden ornaments in a territory where such clothes are not in style for men to wear or where such ornaments are not put on by any save women, all depending on the custom of the land. A man who adorned himself with woman&#x2019;s ornaments, or a woman who adorned herself with man&#x2019;s ornaments, are striped. One who picks white hairs from his head or beard,<sup><xref rid="fn395">12</xref></sup> after he had picked the first hair thereof is guilty and is striped, because he adorned himself with woman&#x2019;s ornaments. Likewise if he dyed his hair black, after he had dyed the first white hair he is guilty and is striped. A gynander, or androgyne is forbidden to either wrap his head like a woman or shave it man-fashion; but if he did either of the two he is not striped.<sup><xref rid="fn396">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. The etched-in writing against which it is spoken of in the Torah is, not to make an incision in one&#x2019;s flesh and fill in the incision with paint, or ink, or any other dyes which enface. This was an idolatrous custom, to make themselves to idolatry, proclamatory that every one of them is a sold slave to it, and indentured in its service. And, from the moment one will enface with any kind of dye which enfaces, after making an incision in any place of the body, whether it be done by man or by woman, he or she, is striped. If one wrote but did not enface with dye, or if he did enface with dye but did not write in the incision, he is not guilty; for he must do both, write by incision and etch-in with dye, even as it is said: &#x201C;And any etched-in writing shall you not fix on yourselves&#x201D; (Lev. 19. 28). This is to say against the one who does the writing, but he who upon whose flesh the etched-in writing was done is not guilty save if he assisted in a manner to constitute it an overt act; but if he contributed nothing to the work itself he is not striped.<sup><xref rid="fn397">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. One who makes a single incision in his flesh for the dead is striped, for it is said: &#x201C;And for the dead shall ye not make any incision in your flesh&#x201D; (Ibid.), regardless of whether a priest or lay-Israelite does it. If one made a single incision for five dead people, or five incisions for a single dead person, he is striped five times, provided warning was given him in each instance.<sup><xref rid="fn398">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. Cut-making and incision on one&#x2019;s flesh over the dead are identical idolatrous practices, for the idolaters, even as they made incisions on their flesh over the dead because of their sorrow so did they wound themselves in their frenzy for their dieties, as it said: &#x201C;And cut themselves after their custom with knives and spears&#x201D; (I. Kings, 18.28). Even this was forbidden by the Torah, for it is said: &#x201C;Ye shall not cut yourselves&#x201D; (Deut. 14.1), with this distinction, however, if it be over the dead there is no difference whether he made the incision by hand or by instrument he is striped, but if it be for idolatry, with an instrument he is guilty and is striped, but by hand he is not guilty.<sup><xref rid="fn399">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. Included in this prohibitive commandment is also a warning that there shall not be two tribunals in one city, one following one set of customs and the other following another set of customs, for such practice causes great divisions, even as it is said: &#x201C;Ye shall not cut (divide) yourselves&#x201D; (Ibid.), ye shall not multiply divisions.<sup><xref rid="fn400">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. One who makes himself bald between his eyes for the dead, is striped, for it is said: &#x201C;Nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead&#x201D; (Ibid.). Whether one is a lay-Israelite or a priest if either made himself bald between his eyes over the dead he is striped only once. One who makes himself four or five bald spots over one dead person, is striped according to the number of bald spots he made, provided he received warning before he made<sup>9</sup> each one of the bald spots. Whether one makes the baldness by hand, or by poison, or whether he dipped his fingers in poison and put them all at one time in five places of his head, seeing that he made five bald spots, although he had but one warning, he is striped, five times, because they all were made simultaneously. One is as guilty in making baldness anywhere on his head as he is when he makes it between his eyes, even as it is said: &#x201C;They shall not make any baldness upon their head&#x201D; (Lev. 21.4). What size must the baldness be? So as to make a bald spot, bare without hair, as big as a split grain.<sup><xref rid="fn401">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. One who makes a bald spot on his head, or an incision on his flesh over his house that fell in, or over his ship that sunk in the ocean is not guilty, for he is not striped save over the dead alone, or if he makes an incision over idolatry. One who makes baldness upon his neighbor&#x2019;s head, or makes an incision in his friend&#x2019;s flesh, or makes etched-in writing on the flesh of his friend, and his friend did lend assistance to him, as long as their joint action was purposeful both are striped; if one erred and the other did it purposely, the spiteful of the two is lashed but the erring one is guiltless.<sup><xref rid="fn402">19</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn213"><sup>1</sup>Maimonides bases his contention on Gen. 4.26. G.</ftnote>

<p>&#x201C;And when Abraham was forty years old etc. There is an Agadah (folktale) that he was three years old, as it is said: &#x2018;Because that Abraham hearkened unto My voice&#x2019; (Gen. 26.5.). Hebrew for &#x201C;Because&#x201D; is &#x2018;EKB, which in numerals represent 172. Thus God says: &#x2018;EKB, or 172 years, that Abraham hearkened unto My voice. Abraham lived 175 years; deducting the three years before he recognized God, leaves 172.&#x201D; This is no criticism at all, as Maimonides herein outlines that Abraham commenced thinking of God as soon as he was weaned; at forty he had mastered the subject and commenced proclaiming it to the world. C.G.</p>

<ftnote id="fn214"><sup>2</sup>&#x201C;And thus he went onward with his proclamation etc. until he attained the land of Canaan amidst his outcry, even as it is said: &#x2018;And called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God&#x2019;. But I am amazed, behold, there were there Shem and Eber, how have they refrained from raising a protest? Possibly they did protest, but did not chance upon images to destroy them, because they were concealing it from them, until Abraham came and destroyed his father&#x2019;s images&#x201D;. The amazement is out of place. Abraham was in Babylon and Shem and Eber in Canaan, where, Abraham, when he reached there, broke no images but made proclamations that there is but One God. Shem and Eber instructed their disciples the path of God, but made no further efforts, wherefore Abraham is considered greater than they. The assertion that they were concealing the images from Shem and Eber, is not an argument, for Nimrod and his entire government practiced idolatry openly, and people were selling images in stores, even Terah was a dealer in images.

<ftnote id="fn231"><sup>4</sup>&#x201C;If he slaughtered a locust as a sacrifice to it, he is not guilty, unless it be a mode of its worship. One&#x2019;s mind can not accept all this. Can one imagine that the slaughtering of a locust or of a crippled animal is less dignified that casting of feces or compounding of urine? But the text in the Talmud (Abodah Zarah, 50b&#x2013;51) indicates this: The scholars who maintain that slaughtering of a locust carries no guilt, also maintain that idolatry worship has no offshoots; so is the opinion of the one who maintains that a crippled animal, carries no guilt. But Rab Judah and Rab Nahman on behalf on Rab (Abba Ariha) follow Rabbi Judah and the instructor concerning feces, and so is also the law that anything resembling slaughtering or casting of a substance which is breakable is guilty, even though its mode of worship is not so. Moreover, Rab Judah, in maintaining that an idol who is worshiped with a rod shall not be by breaking it or casting it but by another manner, teaches an innovation, that although its mode of service is with a rod, if he casts it he is guiltless, because its service is not by casting and because its substance does not break up&#x201D;. Maimonides herein decides in harmony with the highest authorities. It is not a question of the act being dignified. On the contrary, the act of slaughtering was a practice in the Court of the Temple, yet, because such species were not to be offered, he is held guiltless. As for the practices mentioned herein by Maimonides, it is a verbatim quotation from Abodah Zarah, 50b 51a, and is of historical and of academic importance, particularly to the student of comparative religions in the ancient times. Neither is there even a trace of exaggeration in the Talmudic portraiture of possibilities and eventualities. Idolatry during the ancient times was so grossly practiced, and the populace and their ignorant and deceiving priests so stupid as some people in modern times are steeped in lewdness, and sunk in the mire of prostitution.

Evidently, the <small>RABD</small>. did not have the correct text of Maimonides&#x2019; work, for both &#x201C;love and fear&#x201D; are herein plainly stated. As for the meaning of &#x201C;love and fear&#x201D;, the interpretation of Maimonides is correct. Fear for man would mean duress, and if it be so, Raba&#x2019;s opponent, Abadya, would not pronounce guilt (Sanhedrin, 61a). Of course Maimonides decides as Raba against Abyya. C.G.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn240"><sup>13</sup>&#x201C;One who has an idol made for himself etc. The question I ask is this: Why is he striped, is not the prohibitive precept a general one? Do we not say when one embraces or kisses an idol that he is not striped because the prohibitive precept is a general one, embracing many kinds of worship under the admonition &#x201C;Nor serve them&#x201D;, even so are all images under one general prohibitive precept? I further question: This very decision about one who embraces and kisses etc. that he is not striped is contradicted by the Tosefta, Makkot, (Ch. 4.5) which includes the one who anoints, cleans, (embraces?) or combs an idol among those who are lashed? The first question may, perhaps, be answered, that the many forms of worship, because no such was excercized within the Court of the Temple, and because they were separated from slaughtering, concerning which it is said: &#x2018;He that sacrificeth unto the gods, save unto the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed&#x2019; (Ex. 22.19), and all of them were included in one general prohibitive precept, saying: &#x2018;Nor serve them&#x2019;, is really a general prohibitive precept, whereas the subject of graven images and manner of likeness in idolatry is an individual prohibitive precept.&#x201D; <small>RABD</small>. answered his own first question. As for the second, the Gemara does not quote the Tosefta; evidently upon it we do not rely. Moreover, <small>RABD</small>. quotes the Tosefta incorrectly, as the word &#x201C;embrace&#x201D; does not appear therein. C.G.</ftnote>

If you will say: Because it is discoursed, its image protruding, it is forbidden to be kept in hand, but if it be flat it is permitted, say it till the end: its image sunk in, it may be kept, but if it be flat it is forbidden (Abodah Zarah, 43b)? The end of the argument being that an Israelite is forbidden to make in any way, but if the idolator made it for him, the protruded he is forbidden to keep but the idolator may seal with it for him, and the sunk in he may keep but the idolator is forbidden to seal it for him, and whether it be the image of man or the image of the ministers Above the law is alike to both, and so it is in principle&#x201D;. Maimonides makes no distinction between protruding and flat, or sunk-in images of the ministers Above, as they are never seen protruding; they are not protruding even from the sphere, but appear to-be sunk-in. But the image of man, which is always seen protruding, the prohibitive against making is, therefore, regarding a protruding image only. C.G.</ftnote>

Samuel, 11.1) to their contention. Knowing what punishment there is in store for them and their children, the possibility of a city becoming a seduced city was very remote, and the fact that almost fourteen centuries of national life in Palestine did not produce a single instance where the necessity of making this law operative is in itself evidence that the prescribed severity, as interpreted by Maimonides had a great deal to do with it.

And, in this way he outlines the laws herein; the dependents of a layman are the same to him as the subjects of a king, which he mentions in the third category. The <small>RABD</small>&#x2019;s criticism, being based on the interpretation of the text of the Mishnah, by which his intention is to point out that the three days before a holiday is inapplicable as regards subjects, falls short of contradicting Maimonides.

The Verse which he quotes speaks only of settlement, but not of passing through, and refers only to the seven Canaanite nations&#x201D;.

Neither does Maimonides forbid the idolater to assume the obligation of the seven commandments; he merely states the law that the tribunal does not receive him, which does not at all prevents his residence in Eretz Yisrael.

<ftnote id="fn369"><sup>5</sup>&#x201C;So, too, is one who sets certain signs for himself etc. This is a gross error, for such thing is, indeed, permitted. Perhaps the text (Hullin, 95b) misled him, as he saw there, saying:&#x201D; Such divination which is not like the divination of Eliezer(Gen. 24. 13&#x2013;14) and Jonathan (I. Samuel, 20. 21&#x2013;22) is not considered divining&#x201D;, and he evidently thought that the subject there is concerning a charge against such practice. Whereas it is not all so, for the meaning thereof is this: It is not proper to depend upon it. I wonder how he could think that way of such righteous men. Indeed, had they been present when he said it, they would have applied tongues of fire to his face&#x201D;. Maimonides does not quote the text verbatim, as he omits Jonathan. Eliezer was of the sons of Noah, against whom no charge of divination holds. He really acted in full reliance upon the sign he set for himself by giving her the presents without inquiring as to who she was. Such is forbidden to an Israelite. Jonathan merely set a sign to caution his lad. He did not practice divination, as he was righteous in his observance of the laws of the Torah. The text (Hullin, 95b) does refer to a charge against such practice, what Jonathan did, if one believes it divination. Maimonides deserves no tongues of flame in his face; here as everywhere he shines like a beacon of light. C. G.</ftnote>

Maimonides interprets this concerning matters which already had come to pass, not of what is to happen in the future. Even the interpretation of Rashi (Ibid. q. v.) is not free from amazement regarding &#x201C;suckling&#x201D; mentioned in the text, which he claims that it refers to a newly-born babe. C.

<p>And the interpretation of this commandment, and the principles around it, and emanating from it, is given in the succeeding chapters.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER I</h1>
<p>1. All commandments of the Torah, whether they be mandatory or prohibitive, if a man violates any one of them, either presumptuously or erroneously, when he will repent himself and turn away from his sinful way, he is obliged to confess before God, blessed is He! even as it is said: &#x201C;When a man or woman shall commit any sin..&#x2026; Then they shall confess their sin which they have done (Num. 5.6&#x2013;7), which is a confession of words. Such confession is a mandatory commandment. How is the verbal confession made? The sinner says thus: &#x201C;I beseech Thee, O Great Name! I have sinned; I have been obstinate; I have committed profanity against Thee, particularly in doing thus and such. Now, behold! I have repented and am ashamed of my actions; forever will I not relapse into this thing again.&#x201D; This is the elementary form of confession; but whosoever elaborates in confessing and extends this subject is, indeed, praise-worthy. Likewise all those who bring sin-offerings or trespass-offerings, when they offer their sacrifices, whether for their errors or for their spitefulness, find no atonement in their sacrifices, unless they repent, and deliver themselves of a verbal confession, even as it is said: &#x201C;He shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing&#x201D; (Lev. 5.5) So, too, are the guilty upon whom the tribunal pronounced either a sentence of death or of stripes, who find no atonement either in their death or in being lashed unless they do repent and make verbal confession. Even he, who injures his friend or causes him damages in money matters, although he makes restitution of what he owes him, finds no atonement, unless he makes verbal confession and repents by obligating himself never to repeat this again, even as is said: &#x201C;Any sin that man commits&#x201D; (Num. 5.6).<sup><xref rid="fn403">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. The Azazel-goat, because it is atoning for all Israel, the High-Priest confesses over it in the speech of all Israel, even as it is said: &#x201C;And confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel&#x201D; (Lev. 16.21). The Azazel-goat, moreover, atones for all transgressions mentioned in the Torah, both, minor and major, whether one committed it in spite or whether he committed it in error, whether it was done by him knowingly or unknowingly&#x2014; for all the Azazel-goat atones, provided the sinner did repent. But if he repenteth not, the Azazel-goat atones not save for his minor sins. And, what are the minor and what are the major sins? The major sins are such as carry the guilt of death or excision, included among which are also vain and false swearing, although they do not carry the guilt of excision; and all other prohibitive or mandatory commandments which do not carry the guilt of excision are the minor.<sup><xref rid="fn404">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. At this time, when the Temple is not established and, therefore, no altar to atone for us, there is nothing else left for us but repentance. Repentance atones for all sins. Even one who was an evildoer all his life but repented in the end, not a thing of the wickedness is held out against him, even as it is said: &#x201C;As for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness&#x201D; (Ez. 33.12). Even the Day of Atonement itself atones only for those who did repent, even as it is said: &#x201C;For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you&#x201D; (Lev. 16.30).<sup><xref rid="fn405">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. Even on the presumption that repentance atones for all sins, and the Day of Atonement as such, too, atones, there are yet certain sins which are wiped off at the time, and certain other sins which are are not wiped off but after a lapse of time. For example? If a man violated a mandatory commandment which does not carry the guilt of excision and did repent, he moves not from the place of prayer before he is forgiven. Of such it is said: &#x201C;Return, ye backsliding children and I will heal your back-slidings&#x201D; (Jer. 3.22). If he violated a prohibitive commandment which carries neither excision nor death by a tribunal, and did repent, the repentance suspends punishment, whereafter the Day of Atonement wipes out the sin. Of such it is said: &#x201C;For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you&#x201D; (Lev. 16. 30). If he sinned in matters which carry excisions and deaths by a tribunal and did repent, repentance and the Day of Atonement suspend punishment, and the pain which he suffers thereafter complete the atonement for him. Forsooth, no complete atonement ever comes to the penitent before he has a visitation of suffering. Of such it is said: &#x201C;Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with strokes&#x2019;&#x201D; (Ps. 89.32). That saying is concerning a sinner who did not blaspheme the Name in connnection with his transgression, but whosoever blasphemes the Name even he did repent, and the Day of Atonement did come and he still be a penitent, and sufferings did visit him, no complete atonement is granted to him till his death, for, repentance, the Day of Atonement and sufferings suspend punishment, and only death atones for him, even as it is said: &#x201C;And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of hosts. Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die&#x201D; (Is. 22.14)<sup><xref rid="fn406">4</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER II</h1>
<p>1. What is complete repentance? He who once more had in it in his power to repeat a violation, but separated himself therefrom, and did not do it because of repentance, not out of fear or lack of strength. For example? One who knew a woman sinfully, and after a process of time he met her again privately, and he still loving her as theretofore, and he being in a state of potency, and the meeting is in the same land where the sin was first committed, if he parted without sinning, he has attained complete repentance. Of such Solomon said: &#x201C;Remember then thy Creator in the days of thy youth&#x201D; (Ecc. 12.1). Even if he made no reparation save in his old age, at a time when it was already impossible for him to repeat his misdeeds, although it is not the best repentance, it still is of help to him and he is considered a penitent. Moreover, though he continued a life of sin but did repent on his dying day, and did die a penitent, all of his sins are forgiven, even as it is said: &#x201C;While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain&#x201D; (Ibid. 12.2), yea, that is the day of death. Deduct herefrom that if he remembered his Creator and did repent ere he died, he was forgiven.<sup><xref rid="fn407">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. What is repentance? The sinner shall cease sinning, and remove sin from his thoughts, and wholeheartedly conclude not to revert back to it, even as it is said: &#x201C;Let the wicked forsake his way&#x201D; (Is. 55.7); so, too, shall he be remorseful on what was past, even as it is said: &#x201C;Surely after that I was turned, I repented&#x201D; (Jer. 31. 19). In addition thereto he should take to witness Him Who knoweth all secrets that forever he will not turn to repeat that sin again, according to what it is said: &#x201C;Say unto Him.&#x2026; neither will we call any more the work of our hands our gods&#x201D; (Hos. 14.3&#x2013;4). It is, moreover, essential that his confession shall be by spoken words of his lips, and all that which he concluded in his heart shall be formed in speech.<sup><xref rid="fn408">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. He who confesses by speech but has not his heart&#x2019;s consent to abandon his erstwhile conduct, behold him, he is like one taking an immersion of purification and in his grasp is an impure creeping thing, when he knows the immersion to be of no value till he cast away the impure creeping thing. Even so it is advised to do, saying: &#x201C;But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall shall obtain mercy&#x201D; (Pro. 28. 13). In confessing to God, it is obligatory to name the sin, even as it is said: &#x201C;Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them a god of gold&#x201D; (Ex. 32.31).<sup><xref rid="fn409">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. Among the ways of repentance are, for the penitent to continue to cry out in tearful supplication before the Name, to bestow alms according to his means, and to distance himself exceedingly from the thing wherein he sinned, to have his indentity changed, as if saying: &#x201C;I am now another person, and not that person who perpetrated those misdeeds&#x201D;, to completely change his conduct for the good and straight path, and to exile himself from his place of residence, for exile atones iniquity, because it leads him to submissiveness and to be meek and humble-spirited.<sup><xref rid="fn410">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. The penitent who confesses publicly is praiseworthy, and it is commendable for him to let the public know his iniquities, and to reveal the sins between himself and his neighbor to others, saying to them: &#x201C;Truly, I have sinned against that man, and I have wronged him thus and such, but, behold me this day, I repent and am remorseful&#x201D;. But he, who is arrogant and reveals not but covers up his sins, is not a wholehearted penitent, of whom it is said: &#x201C;He that covereth his sins shall not prosper&#x201D; (Prov. 28.13). But that is saying solely concerning sins between man and man,<sup><xref rid="fn411">5</xref></sup> but sins between man and God, the penitent need not make public, on the contrary it would be impudent of him to reveal them. He, however, should repent before God, blessed is he! and before Him he should detail his sins; and then make public confession upon them by simply saying: &#x201C;I have sinned&#x201D;. Such procedure is, indeed, for his own good, even as it is said: &#x201C;Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered (Ps. 32.1).<sup><xref rid="fn412">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. Although it is ever well to cry out and repent, but during the space of the ten days&#x2019; time between Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom ha-Kippurim it is exceedingly better, and the supplication is presently accepted, even as it is said: &#x201C;Seek ye the Lord while He may be found&#x201D; (Is. 55.6). But that is saying solely concerning an individual, but a community every time they cry out a whole hearted repentance they are answered, even as it is said: &#x201C;As the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for&#x201D; (Deut. 6.7).<sup><xref rid="fn413">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. Yom ha-Kippurim is the time set aside for repentance for all, the individual as well as the many; for it is the goal of exoneration and quittance in Israel. Because thereof all are obliged to make reparation and confession on the Day of Atonement. The commandment to confess on the Day of Atonement obliges every one to commence it during the afternoon on the ninth day of Tishri, before the evening meal, lest he be sufficated eating his meal before he confess. And, though he did confess before his meal, one is obliged to confess gain during the night prayer of the Day of Atonement, and to repeat the confession during the Morning, Addition, Oblation, and Closing Prayers. At what part of the prayers is the confession made? Every individual delivers it after the silent Benedictions, but the public Reader in the midst of his prayers, after the Fourth Benediction.<sup><xref rid="fn414">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. The accepted confession of all Israel contains this verse: &#x201C;But all of us have sinned&#x201D;, which is the component part of the confession. Sins which he had made confession of one Day of Atonement, one should repeat and make confession on every other Day of Atonement. though he continues to be a penitent, even as it is said: &#x201C;For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me&#x201D; (Ps. 51.3).<sup><xref rid="fn415">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. Neither repentance nor the Day of Atonement atone for any save for sins committed between man and God, for instance, one who ate forbidden food, or had forbidden coition and the like; but sins between man and man, for instance, one injures his neighbor, or curses his neighbor or plunders him, or offends him in like matters, is ever not absolved unless he makes restitution of what he owes and begs the forgiveness of his neighbor. And, although he make restitution of the monetory debt, he is obliged to pacify him and to beg his forgiveness. Even he offended not his neighbor in aught save in words, he is obliged to appease him and implore him till he be forgiven by him. If his neighbor refuses a committee of three friends to forgive him, he should bring to implore and beg of him; if he still refuses he should bring a second, even a third committee, and if he remains obstinate, he may leave him to himself and pass on, for the sin then rests upon him who refuses forgiveness. But if it happened to be his master, he should go and come to him for forgiveness even a thousand times till he does forgive him.<sup><xref rid="fn416">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. It is forbidden for man to be ill-natured and unforgiving, for he must be easily appeased but unwidely to wrath; and when a sinner implores him for pardon, he should grant him pardon wholeheartedly and soulfully. Even if one persecuted him and sinned against him exceedingly he should not be vengeful and grudge-bearing, for such is the path of the seed of Israel and of their excellent heart. Only the idolaters are not so, they are of uncircumcised heart, and their wrath is ever-watchful; and, because the Gibonites were unforgiving and unappeasing, that of them it is said: &#x201C;Now the Gibonites were not of the children of Israel&#x201D; (II. Samuel, 21.2).<sup><xref rid="fn417">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. One who committed a sin against a friend, and the friend died before he asked his forgiveness, should bring ten adults at his grave and there say: &#x201C;I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel and against this man (naming him), and I have done against him thus and such (naming the sins). If he was indebted to him he should return the money to the heirs; if he knew not of his heirs he should leave the amount with the tribunal, whenafter his confession should be delivered.<sup><xref rid="fn418">12</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER III</h1>
<p>1. Each and every one of the sons of man has virtues and vices. He whose virtues exceed his vices is a just man, and he whose vices exceed his virtues is an evildoer; if both are evenly balanced, he is mediocre. Even so is a state. If the virtues of all of its inhabitants exceeded their vices, it is, indeed, a just state; but if their vices exceeded, it is, indeed, a wicked state. Even such is a standard for the whole world.<sup><xref rid="fn419">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. A man whose vices exceed his virtues presently dies in his wickedness, even as it is said: &#x201C;For the multitude of thine iniquity&#x201D; (Hos. 9. 7). So is a state whose vices exceed presently destroyed, even as it is said: &#x201C;Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorroh is great (Gen. 18. 20). So, too, is the whole world, if their vices exceeded their virtues they are presently destroyed, even as it is said: &#x201C;And God saw that the wickedness of man was great&#x201D; (6. 5). But the weighing of this is not according to the number of virtues and vices, but according to their magnitude. There is a virtue that overbalances many vices, even as it is said: &#x201C;Because in him there is found some good thing&#x201D; (I Kings, 14. 13); and there is a kind of vice which overbalances many virtues, even as it is said: &#x201C;But one sinner destroyeth much good&#x201D; (Ecc. 9. 18). Moreover these are not weighed by anyone, save only in the knowledge of the All-knowing God, for only He knoweth the estimate of virtues versus vices. (<xref rid="fn420">3</xref>)</p>
<p>3. One who renounces his observance of the commandments, and recants his virtues, saying in his heart: &#x201C;In what have I advanced by observing these, fain would I not have observed them&#x201D;!, he, indeed, lost the virtues of all of them, and by no virtue in the world should he be remembered, even as it is said&#x201D;. The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression&#x201D; (Ezek. 33. 12); on no other can this be said than on him who recants his first virtues. And, even as man&#x2019;s virtues and vices are weighed at the time of his death so are the vices and virtues of each and every one who cometh on this earth weighed on the holy time of Rosh ha-Shanah. He who is found righteous is sealed for life; he who is found wicked is sealed for death, and the midiocre is suspended till the Day of Atonement, if he did repent he is sealed for life, if not he is sealed for death.<sup><xref rid="fn421">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. Notwithstanding that the blowing of the ram&#x2019;s horn trumpet on Rosh ha-Shanah is a Scriptural statute, its blast is symbolic, as if saying: &#x201C;Ye that sleep, bestir yourselves from your sleep, and ye slumbering, emerge from your slumber, examine your conduct, turn in repentance, and remember your Creater! They that forget the truth because of the vanities of the times, who err all of their years by pursuing vanity and idleness, which are of neither benefit nor of salvation, care for your souls, improve your ways and your tendencies, let each one of you abandon his evil path and his thought which is not pure! It is, therefore, necessary for every man to behold himself throughout the whole year in a light of being evenly balanced between innocence and guilt, and look upon the entire world as if evenly balanced between innocence and guilt; thus, if he commit one sin, he will overbalance himself and the whole world to the side of guilt, and be a cause of its destruction; but if he perform one duty, behold, he will overbalance himself and the whole world to the side of virtue, and bring about his own and their salvation and escape, even as it is said: &#x201C;But the righteous is an everlasting foundation&#x201D; (Prov. 10. 25), it is he, by whose righteousness he overbalanced the whole world to virtue and saved it. And, because of this matter, it became the custom of the whole house of Israel to excel in alms-giving, in good conduct and in the performance of duties during the intervening days of Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom ha-Kippurim above what they do during the whole year. It also became a universal custom to rise early during those ten days, to deliver in the synagogues prayers of supplication and ardor till the dawn of the day.<sup><xref rid="fn422">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. When the vices and virtues of man are weighed neither the first nor the second time is taken into consideration, but from the third time onward;<sup><xref rid="fn423">6</xref></sup> if his vices from the third time onward exceed his virtues, then those two transgressions, too are added, and he is tried on all; but if his virtues balance his vices from the third transgression onward, all of his transgressions are wiped off one by one, as the third transgression is counted as the first for the two long since had been forgiven, so is the fourth considered thereafter first, as the third long since had been forgiven, and this way till end of the transgressions. That is saying concerning an individual, of whom it is said: &#x201C;Lo, all these things does God work, twice, yea thrice, with a man&#x201D; (Job. 33. 29): but concerning a congregation, the first, second and third transgression is held suspended over them, even as it is said: &#x201C;Thus saith the Lord: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not reverse it&#x201D; (Amos. 2. 6) and when the reckoning comes up, the reckoning is made even in this manner, i. e. from the fourth transgression and onward. The intermediary category, if there be among the half of their transgressions such sins as never having put on phylacteries, each one is judged according to his transgressions, but has a share in the World to Come. Even so are the wicked whose vices are more than their virtues judged according to their transgressions but have a share in the World to Come; for all Israel have a share in the World to Come, even as it is said: &#x201C;Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever&#x201D; (Is. 60. 21). So, too, do the righteous of among the nations of the world have a share in the World to Come.<sup><xref rid="fn424">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. And, the following are they that have no share in the World to Come but suffer excision and loss of identity, and are damned for ever and ever for their exceeding wickedness and sinfulness: atheists, infidels, traducers of the Torah, dissenters of resurrection and the coming of a Redeamer, apostates, enticers of many to sin, seceders from the congregation, a public perpetrator of sins emulating Jehoiakim,<sup><xref rid="fn425">8</xref></sup> informers, leaders who cast fear upon the congregation not for the sake of God, shedders of blood by defaming people in public, evil-tongued people, he who abolishes circumcision.<sup><xref rid="fn426">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. There are five categories of atheists;<sup><xref rid="fn427">10</xref></sup> (1) he who says that there is no God and no Omnipotence; (2) he who says that there is an Omnipotence but that there are two or more such; (3) he who says that there is One Lord;<sup><xref rid="fn428">11</xref></sup> but that He is corporeal and has a form; (4) Likewise one who says that He alone is not the First Cause<sup><xref rid="fn429">12</xref></sup> and Creator of all; (5) likewise he who worships a star, or planet, or any other as a mediator between him and the Lord of the universe; every one of these five is an atheist.<sup><xref rid="fn430">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. There are three categories of infidels: (1) he who says that prophecy is altogether an invention, and that no knowledge reaches the heart of the sons of man from the Creator; (2) he who denies the prophecy of Moses our Master; (3) and he who says that the Creator knoweth not the affairs of the sons of man; every one of these three is an infidel. There are three categories of Torah traducers: (1) he who says that the Torah is not God given, even if he says that a single Verse or one word thereof was spoken by Moses on his own authority is, indeed, a traducer of the Torah; (2) he who denies its Oral explanation, that is the Oral Torah, or its exponents, even as Zaduk and Bythos did;<sup><xref rid="fn431">14</xref></sup> (3) he who says that the Creator commuted this Duty for another duty and that the Torah had been nullified long ago though it really was God given; every one of these three is a traducer of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn432">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. There are two categories of apostates in Israel: (1) an apostate against one commandment; (2) an apostate against the whole Torah. The apostate against one commandment is; one who emboldens himself to transgress a given commandment consciously so that it becomes his habit of doing it publicly, even it be of the minor commandments, for instance, he persistently wears garment mixed of wool and flax, or rounds the corners of his head, as a consequence whereof it appears that such commandment no longer exists in his world, such one is, indeed, an apostate in this matter, if he does such spitefully. An apostate against the whole Torah is, a convert to the religion of the idolaters,<sup><xref rid="fn433">16</xref></sup> for instance, at a time when they issue arbitrary edicts and he cleaves to them, saying: &#x201C;Of what profit is there for me to cleave to Israel who are down-trodden and persecuted; it is rather best for me to cleave to these in whose hand lies the power&#x201D;, he, assuredly, is apostate against the whole Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn434">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. How are they that cause the public to sin identified? All of the following are of one kind: whether one causes the public to sin in a major matter, as for instance, Jeroboam, Zaduck and Bythos did,<sup><xref rid="fn435">18</xref></sup> or whether he causes the public to sin in a minor matter, even to nullify one mandatory commandment; whether one causes others to sin by force as Manasseh did, for he slew the people of Israel unless they worshiped idolatry, or whether he deceived others and enticed them.<sup><xref rid="fn436">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. One who secedes from the paths of the congregation, although he committed no transgressions, but remains separated from the congregation of Israel, observes no commandments together with them, does not include himself in their troubles, nor afflicts himself on their fast-days, but follows his own path as the rest of the people of the land, acting as if he was not one of them, he has no share in the World to Come. One who commits transgressions high-handedly like Jehoiakim,<sup><xref rid="fn437">20</xref></sup> whether his acts were against minor or against major commandments, he has no share in the World to Come. Verily, he is one of whom it is said: &#x201C;He reveals a face in the Torah not according to law&#x201D;, seeing that he hardened his forehead, exposed his face and is not ashamed to disobey the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn438">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. There are two categories of informers: (1) he who informs against his neighbor so that he be turned over to an idolatrous hand either to be put to death or to be maltreated; (2) he who informs against his neighbor so that his money be turned over to an idolatrous hand, or to the hand of a robber, who is like an idolater; both categories of such have no share in the World to come.<sup><xref rid="fn439">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. They that cast fear upon the public for ungodly purposes are limited to one category; it is he who rules over the public by strong hand, and they fear and dread him, whereas his own objective is, self-aggrandizement, and all of his desires are not to glorify Heaven. An example of such, behold the idolatrous rulers.<sup><xref rid="fn440">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. Each and every one of the enumerated twenty-four different categories of persons, Israelites though they be, have no share in the World to Come. And, there are yet lesser transgressions than those referred to concerning which the sages, nevertheless, said, that he who makes a practice to violate them has no share in the World to Come, and that they are of sufficient importance to be kept at a distance, and to watch out against them. They are: he who gives an alias name to his friend; he who calls his friend by his aliases; he who shames his friend publicly; he who glorifies himself by disgracing his friend; he who insults scholars; he who insults his masters; he who despises holy times; he who profanes holy objects. That is saying, that none of these will have a share in the World to Come, if he dies without repentance; but if he repent from his wickedness and died in a state of repentance, he is, indeed, of the sons of the World to Come, as there is not a thing to stand in the way of repentance. Even if one who denied the existence of God all of his life but in the end repented, has a share in the World to Come, for it is said: &#x201C;Peace, peace, to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the Lord; and I will heal him&#x201D; (Is. 57.19). All of the wicked, and apostates and their like who turned in repentance, whether publicly or secretly, should be accepted back into the folds of Israel, even as it is said: &#x201C;Return ye backsliding children&#x201D; (Jer. 3.22)&#x2014;though he still be backsliding, for, 10, he repented secretly and not publicly, yet is his repentence accepted.<sup><xref rid="fn441">22</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER IV</h1>
<p>1. Twenty-four different transgressions withhold the acceptance of repentance, four of these are of great iniquity, and whosoever commits one of them, the Holy One, blessed is He! provides no means for him to repent, measured, of course, with the monstrosity of his sin. They are: (1) he who leads the public to sin, by which is also included one who witholds the public from performing a commandment; (2) he who diverts his neighbor from the good path to an evil one, for instance, a seducer and an enticer; (3) he who beholds his son cultivating bad habits and does not protest against it, for, his son being under his control, probably, by having protested, he could have separated him therefrom, as a consequence whereof it is as if he himself led him to sin; by which is also included the iniquity of every one who has a possibility to protest against others, whether individuals or many, and does not protest against them but leaves them to their stumbling; (4) he who says: &#x201C;I will sin and repent&#x201D;; by which is also included one who says: &#x201C;I will sin and the Day of Atonement will atone&#x201D;.</p>
<p>2. Among this group of twenty-four are five transgressions which block the way of repentance against the sinners, they are: (1) he who secedes from the community, for he would be absent at the time they repent and could not acquire aught in their virtuous performance; (2) He who opposes the decisions of the sages, for his opposition to them brings about his own separation from them, and he knows not the path leading to repentance; (3) he who disdains the precepts, for as they appear debased to him he does not pursue after them nor perform them, and without performance what virtue can he attain? (4) he who insults his masters, for such conduct brings about his displacement and repudiation, even as it happened to Gehazi<sup><xref rid="fn442">2</xref></sup>, and being repudiated he will not find a teacher to guide him to the path of truth; (5) He who despises criticism for he, indeed, left no path open for repentance, as it is criticism that begets repentance. Forsooth, when a man is informed that his sins are known, and that he should be ashamed of himself for his wrongdoings, he does repent. For example: it written in the Torah: &#x201C;Remember, forget thou not, how thou didst make the Lord thy God wroth in the wilderness; from the day that thou didst go forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the Lord&#x201D; (Deut. 9.7), and: &#x201C;But the Lord hath not given you a heart to know&#x201D; (Ibid. 29.3), and: &#x201C;A foolish people and unwise&#x201D; (Ibid. 32.6); and Isaiah, likewise, rebuked Israel and exclaimed: &#x201C;Ah sinful nation!&#x201D; (Is. 1.4) and, &#x201C;The ox knoweth his owner&#x201D; (Ibid. &#x2013;3), and, &#x201C;Because I knew that thou are obstinate&#x201D; (Ibid. 48.4). Almighty, too, charged him to rebuke the sinners, saying: &#x201C;Cry aloud, spare not&#x201D; (Is. 58. 1). In like manner did all of the prophets criticise Israel until they turned in repentance. It is, therefore, necessary to appoint over each and every community in Israel a great scholar of mature age, God-fearing since his early youth, and loved by them, people, to preach to the public and turn them to repentance. But he who despises criticism does not come to hear the preacher and does not pay attention to his words, he, therefore, holds on to his sins, which to his eyes appear to be good.<sup><xref rid="fn443">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. And, again, there are among this group of twenty-four, five transgressors, each of which, block the path of complete repentance for the one commits it, because they are sins between man and man, and the sinner does not know the neighbor against whom he sinned, to whom to make restitution or of whom to beg forgiveness. They are: (1) he who curses the public and did not curse a single man in particular to whom he might plead for pardon; (2) he who shares spoils with a thief, because he knows not to whom the stolen goods belong, for the thief steals at large and brings it to him and he becomes the fence, thereby adding to the iniquity by upholding the thief and leading him on to further sin; (3) he who finds a lost article and does not advertise it so as to restore it to its owner, thus after a process of time when he would repent he knows not to whom to make restitution; (4) he who partakes of an ox<sup><xref rid="fn444">4</xref></sup> which is the property of the poor<sup><xref rid="fn445">5</xref></sup>, the orphans or the widows, for such people are languid, unknown and un-heralded, wandering from city to city without a friend, and he, therefore, would not know to whom such ox belongs if he desired to make restitution; (5) he who takes bribery to pervert justice, for he knows not the extent of the perversion, or what its power is, as such matter has auxiliary factors, and, therefore, could possibly not estimate the amount of restitution; and he, moreover, is supporting the evil hand of the bribe-giver and thereby leads him on to sin.<sup><xref rid="fn446">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. And, there are, furthermore, five transgressions among this group of twenty-four, the presumption of one who commits each and every one of them being against his inclination to turn toward repentance, because the majority of people consider them of minor importance, as a consequence whereof one stoops in sin imagining that what he does is no sin at all. They are: (1) he who dines at a table knowing that the meal is of insufficient quantity to satisfy even the appetite of the host, for such is an offshoot of robbery, whereas he imagines, saying: &#x201C;Have I not eaten with the consent of the host?&#x201D; (2) he who makes use of a poor man&#x2019;s pledge, for a poor man&#x2019;s pledge is none else save an article such as an axe or plough, whereas he will say in his imagination: &#x201C;Nothing thereof was diminished, I have not robbed him&#x201D;; (3) he who wantonly stares at the opposite sex, for he thinks that it is of no matter, saying: &#x201C;Have I stilled an urge, or even been near her&#x201D;? whereas he remains oblivious to the fact that purposeful eye-staring is a great iniquity and begets actual unchastity, even as it is said: &#x201C;And that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes&#x201D; (Num. 15.39); (4) he who acquires honor by disgracing his neighbor, for he thinks that he committed no sin, as his neighbor stood not by, and did not feel the shame, as he did not insult him personally, save by comparing his own good conduct and his own education against the conduct of his neighbor or his education so that the audience may infer that he is honorable and his neighbor disgraceful; (5) he who casts suspicion upon the upright, for he thinks within his heart that he sinned not, saying to himself: &#x201C;What have I done to him, is there anything more to it than mere suspicion? perhaps he did it, and perhaps he did it not;&#x201D; whereas he does realize that this is an iniquity to place an upright man in his mind on the same level with an evil-doer.<sup><xref rid="fn447">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. And among this group of twenty-four there are five such transgressions that whosoever commits them is continuously pursuing them, so that it becomes hard for him to separate himself from them. It is, therefore, necessary for a man to beware of them, lest they become part of his habits, for they are all extremely evil tendencies. They are: (1) sycophancy; (2) an evil tongue; (3) ill temper; (4) bad thoughts; (5) companionship with the wicked, for he learns his conduct and his actions become indited in his heart. Of such Solomon said: &#x201C;But a companion of fools shall be shattered&#x201D; (Prov. 13.20). Regarding this, we have already elucidated in the &#x201C;Treatise of Ethics&#x201D; how a man of the average should conduct himself, deduct the major from the minor for a penitent.<sup><xref rid="fn448">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. All the enumerated transgressions and their like, though they withold the sinners from turning to repentance they should not be prevented from doing so, for if a man did turn away from these in repentance, lo, he is a penitent, and he will inherit a share in the World to Come.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER V</h1>
<p>1. Every man was endowed with a free will; if he desires to bend himself toward the good path and to be just it is within the power of his hand to reach out for it, and if he desires to bend himself to a bad path and to be wicked it is within the power of his hand to reach out for it. This is known from what it is written in the Torah, saying: &#x201C;Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil&#x201D; (Gen. 3.22), that is as if saying: &#x201C;Behold, this species, man, stands alone in the world, and there is no other kind like him, as regards this subject of being able of his own accord, by his reason and thought, to know the good and the evil, and to do whatever his inclination dictates him with none to stay his hand from either doing good or evil; and, being that he is so, &#x2018;Lest he put forth his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever&#x2019;&#x201D; (Ibid.)<sup><xref rid="fn449">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Permit not your thought to dwell upon that which ridiculous fools of other peoples and a majority of asinine individuals among the children of Israel say, that the Holy One, blessed is He! decrees at the very embryonic state of every man whether he should be just or wicked. The matter is not so. Every man is capable of being as just as Moses our Master or as wicked as Jeroboam, wise or incony, merciful or human, miser or philanthropist, and so in all other tendencies. There is none to either force things upon him or to decree things against him; either to pull him one way or draw him another way, but he alone, of his own free will, with the consent of his mind, bends to any path he may desire to follow. It is concerning this that Jeremiah said: &#x201C;Out of the mouth of the Most High proceedeth not the evil and the good&#x201D; (Lam. 3. 38),<sup><xref rid="fn450">2</xref></sup> which is as if saying, the Creator decrees not that man should be either good or bad. Now, this being so, the consequence hereof is that the sinner alone brought harm upon himself. It is, therefore, meet that he should lament and shed tears because he sinned, and because of what he did to his soul and rewarded it with evil. Even this is the meaning of the succeeding Verse: &#x201C;Wherefore doth a living man complain, or a strong man? Because of his sins&#x201D; (Ibid.)<sup><xref rid="fn451">3</xref></sup> Again, he continues, in the succeeding Verse seeing that it all is in our power, and we did all the evil of our own free will and accord, it is, indeed meet for us to turn in repentance and abandon our wickedness, for our free will is in our hands now as well as at the time we committed the sins saying: &#x201C;Let us search and try our ways, and return to the Lord&#x201D; (Ibid.&#x2013;40).<sup><xref rid="fn452">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. And, this matter is a great and component part, the very pillar of the Torah and its precepts, even as it is said: &#x201C;See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil&#x201D; (Deut. 30.15), and it is, moreover, written: &#x201C;Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and curse&#x201D; (Ibid. 11.26). This is as if saying, the power is in your hand, and whatever human activity man may be inclined to carry on he has a free will to elect either good or evil. And, because of this very subject it is said: &#x201C;Oh, who would grant that they had such a heart as this, to fear Me, and to keep all my commandments at all times&#x201D; (Ibid. 5.26). This is as if saying, that the Creator forces not the sons of man, and makes no decrees against them that they should do good or evil, but that it all is in their own keeping.<sup><xref rid="fn453">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. Had the decree of God prompted man to be either just or wicked, or had there been a fundamentally inborn something to draw man to either of the paths, or to any one branch of knowledge, or to a given tendency of the tendencies, or to particular act of all actions as the astrologists maintain by their foolish inventions, how did He charge us by the prophets, to do thus and not to do such, improve your ways, and do not follow your wickedness, whereas man from his embryonic state already had a decree of his conduct issued, or his inborn nature draws him toward a given path of conduct from which he can not deviate? Moreover, what need would there be, under such circumstances, for the Torah altogether? And by what law, and under what system of justice could the wicked be punished, or the just rewarded? Shall the judge of the whole earth not exercise justice? Now, do not wonder and ask: &#x201C;How is it possible for man to do what his heart desires, and have his entire course of action lodged within himself seeing that he can not do aught in the world without the permission of his Master and without His Will, even as the Verse says: &#x201C;Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that hath He done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps&#x201D; (Ps. 135.6)? Know all that man does is in accordance with His Will, although our actions are really in our own keeping. For example? Even as it is the Creator&#x2019;s Will that fire and air shall ascend upward, and that water and earth shall descend downward, or that the sphere shall revolve in a circle, and that other creatures of the universe should likewise follow their respective natural laws, as it was His Will for them to be, so was it His Will that man shall have the free choice of conduct in his own hand, and that all his actions should be lodged within him, and that he should be neither forced or drawn, but he, of his own free will and accord, as God endowed him with, he exercises in all that is possible for man to do. He is, therefore, judged according to actions; if he did good, his is rewarded with good; and if he did wrong, he is punished. This is in harmony with what the prophet said: &#x201C;This hath been of your own doing&#x201D; (Mal. 1.9); and: &#x201C;According as they have chosen their own ways&#x201D; (Is. 66.3); and of this very subject Solomon said: &#x201C;Rejoice O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment&#x201D; (Ecc. 11. 9); as if saying: &#x201C;True, it is within the power of thine hand to do so, but thou art to render an accounting on the day of judgment&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn454">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. Peradventure, thou wilt ask: &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed is He, does he not know what it will be before it will come to pass? Did he know whether a certain person will be either just or wicked, or did He not know it? If he knew that he would be just, then it would be impossible for him not to be just? If thou wilt say that He did know that he would be just but that it is possible for him to be wicked, lo, He did not know the matter clearly? Know, that the answer to this question is longer in measure than the earth and broader than the sea, and many great elements and ranking mountains are suspended thereon; but it is essential that you know this fundamental matter which I outline. In the second chapter of the treatise of Fundamentals of the Torah it was already elucidated that the Holy One, blessed is He! does not know of things with a knowledge which exists outside of Himself, like, for instance, the sons of man do, for they and their knowledge are two separate things; but, He, may His Name be exalted! and his knowledge are One, and it is not within the power of the knowledge of man to attain this matter clearly, and even as it is not within the power of man to attain and find the truth of the Creator, even as it is said: &#x201C;For man shall not see Me and live&#x201D; (Ex. 33.20), even so it is not within the power of man to attain and find the knowledge of the Creator. This is even what the prophet said: &#x201C;For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the Lord&#x201D; (Is. 55.8). This being so, it is not within our intellectual power to know in what manner the Holy One, blessed is He! knows all the creatures and their actions,<sup><xref rid="fn455">7</xref></sup> but we do know without a doubt that man&#x2019;s behavior is in the hand of man, and that the Holy One, blessed is He! neither draws him nor issues edicts against him to do as he does. And, not solely because of having accepted the religion do we know that there is no predestination, but even by clear evidence of the words of wisdom. Because thereof it is said in prophecy that man is judged for his actions according to his actions, whether they be good or evil, and this is the very foundation upon which all the words of prophecy depend.<sup><xref rid="fn456">8</xref></sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER VI</h1>
<p>1. There are many verses in the Torah and in the texts of the prophets which appear to contradict this principle, and most people are stumbling thereby, and therefrom they suppose in their mind that the Holy One, blessed is He! predestines for man either to do evil or good, and that the heart of man is not his to bend it to his own will. Wherefor, behold, I am making clear a great principle, out which thou shalt know the explanation of all those verses. When an individual or a people of a state do sin, and the sinner transgressed consciously and of his own free will, as we have already made known in the preceding chapter, it is meet that retribution is visited upon him, and the Holy One, blessed is He! knoweth how to inflict the punishment. There is a category of sin for which justice demands that punishment should be visited upon the sinner in this world, on his body, or his property, or on his infant children, for the little children of man, who have not yet reached the age of intelligence nor attained the age when they are included among those who are obliged to observe the precepts, are considered man&#x2019;s own acquisition, even as it is written: &#x201C;Every man shall be put to death for his own sin&#x201D; (Deut. 24.16)&#x2014;he suffers for his own sins when he reaches the age of man;<sup><xref rid="fn457">1</xref></sup> and there is a category of sin for which justice demands that punishment should be visited upon the transgressors only in the World to Come, and the sinner suffers no harm whatever in this world; and there is still another category of sin for which punishment is inflicted upon the sinner both in this world and the World to Come.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>2. That is saying concerning a sinner as long as he did not repent; but if he did repent, repentance to him is then a coat of armor against punishment. And, to the same extent that man sins consciously and of his own free will, he should turn to repentance consciously and of his own free will.<sup><xref rid="fn458">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. And, it is possible that a man should commit either one grievous iniquity or a multitude of sins so that the Judge of Truth will decree against him that, whereas this sinner committed those sins of his own free will and consciously, repentance should be witheld from him altogether, and grant him no leave to repent, so that he might die and perish in the iniquity he committed. Even this is what the Holy One, blessed is He! said through Isaiah: &#x201C;Make the heart of this people fat, and make their eyes heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they, seeing with their eyes, and hearing with their ears, and understanding with their heart will return and be healed&#x201D; (Is. 6.10). It is, moreover, said: &#x201C;But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words and scoffed at His prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against His people till there was no remedy&#x201D;. (II Chro. 36.16)&#x2014;as if saying: &#x201C;They sinned of their own free will and they have multiplied iniquities, until their guilt carried the punishment to withold repentance from them, which is the remedy&#x201D;. It is, therefore, written in the Torah; &#x201C;And I will harden Pharaoh&#x2019;s heart&#x201D; (Ex. 14.4), because at the beginning he sinned of his own free will, and meted out evil to Israel who sojourned in his land, even as it is said: &#x201C;Come, let us deal wisely with them&#x201D; (Ibid. 1.10). Thereat justice demanded to withold repentance from him, so that due punishment might be visited upon him. Wherefor, the Holy One, blessed is He! hardened his heart. If it be so, then why did He delegate Moses to him, charging him to let Israel go forth and turn to repentance seeing that the Holy One, blessed is He! long since told him thou wilt not let them go forth, saying: &#x201C;But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord God&#x201D; (Ibid. 9.30), and again saying: &#x201C;But in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee My power, and that My name be declared throughout all the earth&#x201D;(Ibid. &#x2013;16)? To demonstrate to the future generations whenever the Holy One, blessed is He! witholds repentance from a sinner he can not repent, but must die in the original evil which he perpetrated of his own free will. Sihon, too, by the measure of his iniquity became guilty of an offence which carried the punishment to have repentance witheld from him, even as it is said: &#x201C;For the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate&#x201D; (Deut. 2.30). Likewise the Canaanites, according to their abominations, did He withold repentance from them so that they engaged Israel in battle, even as it is said: &#x201C;For it was of the Lord, to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed&#x201D; (Joshua, 11.20). Even so was with Israel in the days of Elijah, because of the multiplied iniquity repentance was witheld from the gross evildoers, for it is said: &#x201C;For Thou didst turn their heart backward&#x201D; (I. Kings, 18.37)&#x2014;as if saying: &#x201C;Thou didst withold repentance from them&#x201D;. Thus, as a consequence hereof, we must say: God&#x2019;s predestination prompted not Pharaoh to wrong Israel, nor Sihon to sin in his land, nor the Canaanites to be abominable, nor Israel to worship idolatry; for they all sinned of their own free will and accord, and, therefore, were they all guilty of an offence which carries along the punishment to withold repentance from them.</p>
<p>4. Even on this very subject do the righteous and the prophets supplicate and pray that the Lord may help them to discover the truth. As David said: &#x201C;Teach me Thy way, O Lord, that I may walk in Thy truth&#x201D; (Ps. 86.11), as if saying: &#x201C;let not my sins withold the way of truth, by which I may discover Thy way, and the Oneness of thy Name&#x201D;. Likewise, this Verse: &#x201C;Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and let a free spirit uphold me&#x201D; (Ibid. 51.14), is as if saying: &#x201C;Grant leave to my spirit to do Thy will, and let not my sins be a cause to withold repentance from me; but let the power be in my hand until I will turn, and understand and know the true way&#x201D;. And, in such way all other like verses are interpreted.</p>
<p>5. But what is this that king David said: &#x201C;Good and upright is the Lord; therefore doth he instruct sinners in the way. He guideth the humble in justice; and He teacheth the humble His way&#x201D; (Ibid. 25. 10.11)? This is a reference to the prophets who were sent to make the ways of God known, and to turn the people to repentance. Moreover, He endowed them with a power to study and understand, as it is the tendency of every man to pursue wisdom and righteousness as long as he is trained in the ways of wisdom. This is in harmony with what our Masters, of blessed memory! said: &#x201C;He who comes to be cleansed receives aid&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn459">3</xref></sup>, as if saying: &#x201C;He will find himself aided in the matter he strives after. Now, reverting back to the subject of predestination is it not written in the Torah: &#x201C;Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them&#x201D; (Gen. 15. 13)<sup><xref rid="fn460">4</xref></sup>, lo, here is a decree against the Egyptians to do evil? And it, moreover, written: &#x201C;And this people will rise up, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land&#x201D; (Deut. 31.16), lo, here is a decree against Israel to worship idolatry, then why visit retribution upon them? Because He did not decree that that particularly known person shall be the one to go astray. Forsooth, every individual of those who did go astray to worship idolatry, had he not done so to worship of his own free will, he would not have worshiped. And God made known no more than custom of the world. This is like to one who says: &#x201C;Among this people will be righteous and wicked&#x201D;. Not because of this will the wicked one say that it had long since been decreed that he should be an evildoer, seeing that God made known to Moses that there will be wicked people among Israel. Or, this is like the subject of poverty, of which it is said: &#x201C;For the poor shall never cease out of the land&#x201D; (Ibid. 15.11). Llikewise the Egyptians, if each and every one of those who vexed and wronged Israel had no desire so to wrong them, he had it in his power to refrain from doing it; for, He did not decree against a particular man, but made known to Abraham that in the end his seed will be enslaved in a land which is not theirs. But we have already stated that it is not within the power to comprehend the foreknowledge of the Holy One, blessed is He!</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VII</h1>
<p>1. Because every man was endowed with self-will, as we have elucidated, it is meet that man shall strive to repent, to confess his sins by word of his mouth, and to dust off his hands from his sins, as a preparation for death after repentance, so that he may acquire life in the World to Come.</p>
<p>2. Ever should man look upon himself as if he is nigh to death, lest he die during the interval, as a consequence whereof he will be outstanding in his sin; he should, therefore not tarry but repent presently. He should not say: &#x201C;In old age I will repent&#x201D;, perhaps he will die before old age overtakes him. To this Solomon in his wisdom pointed, saying: &#x201C;Let thy garments always be white&#x201D;. (Ecc. 9.8).<sup><xref rid="fn461">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. Do not say that no repentance is needed save on sins to which action is attached, for example: prostitution, robbery, or theft. For even as it is necessary for man to repent from such, so it is necessary for him to search his bad tendencies, to turn in repentance from anger, from hatred, from jealousy, from deceit, from pursuing after wealth, honor, feasting and such like these; yea, from all of these it is necessary for him to turn in repentance. Indeed these iniquities are more grievous and more difficult for a man to be separated from than those which require action, for on such the prophet Isaiah said: &#x201C;Let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts&#x201D; (Is. 55.7).</p>
<p>4. Let not a penitent man imagine that he is removed at a distance from the degree of the righteous on account of the iniquities and sins which he had committed. It is not so, forsooth, but the Creator considers him beloved and desirable, as if he had ever known of no sin. Moreover, his reward is great; for, after having partaken of the taste of sin, he separated himself therefrom and conquered his passion. The sages said: &#x201C;The place whereon the penitent stand the wholly righteous could not stand;&#x201D; as if saying: &#x201C;their degree is above the degree of those who ever did not sin, because it is more difficult for them to dubdue their passion than for the others.<sup><xref rid="fn462">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. All of the prophets commanded concerning repentance; Israel will not be redeemed save by repentance. Indeed, the Torah long since assured us that in the end, at the close of the period of exile Israel will turn to repentance and be momentarily redeemed, even as it is said: &#x201C;And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessings and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt bethink thyself among all the nations, whither the Lord thy God had driven thee, and shalt return unto the Lord thy God, and hearken to His voice according to all that I commanded thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul; that then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee&#x201D; (Deut. 30.14).<sup><xref rid="fn463">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. Great, indeed, is repentance for it brings man nigh to the Shekinah, even as it is said: &#x201C;Return, O Israel, unto the Lord thy God&#x201D; (Hosea, 14. 2); and it is further said: &#x201C;Yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith the Lord&#x201D; (Amos, 4.6); and it is yet again said: &#x201C;If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, yea, return unto Me&#x201D; (Jer. 4.1), as if saying: &#x201C;If thou wilt turn in repentance ye will cleave unto Me&#x201D;. Repentance brings near the far apart. But yesterday this sinner was hateful to the presence of God, scorned, ostracized and abominate, and to-day he is beloved, desirable, companionable and a friend. Thou findest, moreover, that in the very language God employs to distance the sinners He employs to bring nigh unto Him the penitent whether the individual or the many, even as it is said: &#x201C;And it shall come to pass that, instead of that which was said unto them, &#x2018;Ye are not My people&#x2019;, it shall be said unto them: &#x2018;Ye are the children of the living God&#x2019;. And, again it is said of Jeconiah: &#x201C;Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days, (Jer. 22.30) though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon My right hand yet would I pluck thee thence&#x201D; (Ibid. &#x2013; 24); but when he repented, being in exile, it is said of his son Zerubbabel: &#x201C;In that day, saith the lord of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the Lord, and will make thee as a signet&#x201D; (Haggai, 2.23).<sup><xref rid="fn464">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. How superior is the degree of repentance! But yesterday was this sinner separated from the Lord God of Israel, even as it is said:&#x201D; But your iniquities have separated between you and your God&#x201D; (Is. 59.2); cries, but received no answer, even as it is said:&#x201D; &#x201C;Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear&#x201D; (Ibid. 1.15); does obey commandments, but they are thrown back in his face, even as it is said: &#x201C;Who hath required this at your hand, to trample My courts&#x201D;? (Ibid.&#x2013;12), and, &#x201C;Oh that there were even among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on Mine altar in vain!&#x201D; (Mal. 1.10). But to-day he is connected with the Shekinah, even as it is said: &#x201C;But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day&#x201D; (Deut. 4.4); he cries and receives answer momentarily, even as it is said: &#x201C;And it shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer&#x201D; (Is. 65.24); he observes commandments, and they are received with pleasure and joy, even as it is said: &#x201C;For God hath already accepted thy works&#x201D; (Ecc. 9.7); moreover, his works are pleasurably anticipated, even as it is said: &#x201C;Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years&#x201D; (Mal. 3.4).</p>
<p>8. It is the custom of the penitent to be exceedingly lowly and humble. If fools insult them by reminding them of their former conduct, saying: &#x201C;But yesterday you did thus and such; yesterday you said thus and such&#x201D;, it is best to have no feelings against them, for this very insult is meritorious for the penitent. Indeed, as long as they feel the shame of their past conduct, and the reproach thereof, their virtue increases and their degree grows. But it is, nevertheless, a grievous sin to say to the penitent: &#x201C;Remember your erstwhile conduct&#x201D;, or to remind them in his presence so as to put him to shame, or to mention things and subjects similar to them so as to remind him of what he did. All such is forbidden, and comes under the general law of deceiving one with words, concerning which the Torah did give warning, even as it is said: &#x201C;And ye shall not deceive one another&#x201D; (Lev. 25.17).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VIII</h1>
<p>1. The hidden good in store for the righteous is, life in the World to Come, which is a life connected with no death and a kind of good connected with no evil; such as is described in the Torah: &#x201C;That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest prolong thy days&#x201D; (Deut. 22.7), which was traditionally deducted to mean, &#x201C;That it may be well with thee&#x201D; in a world which is entirely good; &#x201C;and that thou mayest prolong thy days&#x201D;&#x2014;in a world existing forever; and this is the World to Come. The reward of the just is, that they will acquire the sweetness thereof, to be in such goodness; and the punishment of the wicked is, that they will not share in such life, but will suffer excision and eternal death. And, whosoever does not earn such life, is to be dead, without coming to life forever; for he is severed from life by his iniquity and goes to oblivion like a cattle. This is the meaning of excision described in the Torah, saying: &#x201C;That soul shall utterly be cut off&#x201D; (Num. 15.31), which was traditionally deducted to mean, &#x201C;utterly cut of,&#x201D; both in this world and in the World to Come.<sup><xref rid="fn465">1</xref></sup> as if saying: &#x201C;That soul which was separated from the body in this world shares not in the life of the World to Come, for even from the World to Come is it cut off&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn466">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. The World to Come harbors neither body nor aught of a concrete form<sup><xref rid="fn467">3</xref></sup>, save only the souls of the righteous divested of body as are the ministering angels. Inasmuch as it harbors no concrete forms there is no need there for eating, drinking, or other of the bodily necessities of the sons of man in this world; neither will any of the many things which happen to bodies in this world come to pass there, as, for instance, sitting down, standing up, sleep, death, sadness, mirth or the like. Thus did the ancient sages say: &#x201C;In the World to Come there is no eating, no drinking, and no family life, save that the righteous are sitting, graced with garlands upon their heads, and indulge in feasting upon the luminousness of the Shekinah&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn468">4</xref></sup> Herefrom, 10, it is clear to you that no body exists there, seeing that there is neither eating nor drinking. That expression of &#x201C;sitting&#x201D; herein employed, is figurative, as if saying that they are there without effort or fatigue, and the phrase they employed, saying: &#x201C;graced with garlands upon their heads&#x201D;, means that they have conscious knowledge of the reason why they have merited to be in the World to Come, and this is their crown of garlands, as, for example, Solomon said: &#x201C;The crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him&#x201D; (Songs. 3.11). Moreover, it was said: &#x201C;And everlasting shall joy be upon their heads (Is. 35.10); now joy is not a body to rest upon one&#x2019;s head, even so the crown spoken of by the sages refers to knowledge. But what is the meaning of the phrase, &#x201C;and indulge in feasting upon the luminousness of the Shekinah&#x201D;? It is that by which they know and attain part of the Truth of the Holy One, blessed is He! something they do not know while in the dark, low body.<sup><xref rid="fn469">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. The term soul employed on this subject refers not to the breath of life necessary for the body, but the form of the soul which is the intelligence by which it attained knowledge of the Creator&#x2019;s Being according to its intellectual power, and by which it attained knowledge of the non-concrete intelligences and other works of God, even it is the form which we have explained in the fourth chapter of the treatise concerning Fundamentals of the Torah, and it is called soul for the purpose of this subject. The life herein spoken of, because there is no death connected with it, seeing that death is only incidental to the happenings which befall a body, and as there exists no body, is called a collection of life, even as it is said: &#x201C;Yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life&#x201D; (I. Sam. 25.29). And, this reward is such that there is no reward higher than it, and the kind of good after which no other good exists, and it is for it that all of the prophets craved.<sup><xref rid="fn470">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. And this reward is known by many figurative names: The Lord&#x2019;s Mountain; His Holy Place; Holy Path; the Lord&#x2019;s Courts; the Lord&#x2019;s Graciousness; the Lord&#x2019;s Tent; the Lord&#x2019;s Temple; the Lord&#x2019;s House; and the Lord&#x2019;s Gate. And the sages, figuratively, named<sup><xref rid="fn471">7</xref></sup> this Good which is in store for the righteous, Banquet. But its universal name is, the World to Come.</p>
<p>5. The vengeance, than which there is none greater is, that the soul will be cut off and will obtain no share in that life, even as it is said: &#x201C;That soul shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him&#x201D; (Num. 15.31). As for hell, it is what the prophets call figuratively by different names, such as, pit of destruction, burning flame, leech, and by every word which means decay and destruction is it called, because it is an expression of terminating decay from which there is no regeneration and a loss which remains forever unreturned.</p>
<p>6. Peradventure you will consider this Good lightly, and imagine that no reward for observing the precepts and for man to be following wholly the paths of truth is of any worth save if he be eating and drinking good food, enjoying beautiful faces, dressing in garments of embroidered linen, lounging in tents of ivory, being served in dishes of gold or silver, and similar things, as these stupid, silly, licentious Arabs imagine. But scholars and sensible people should know that all such things are idle and vain, wherein there is nothing consequential, and if they are considered of the greatest good by us in this world, it is because we are owners of bodies and concrete forms, and all such things are bodily necessities, and the soul neither craves nor desires for them save because of bodily necessity, so that it may satisfy its desire and remain normal. But when there is no body, all these things are found to be completely nullified. But as to the great Good in which the soul will be in the World to Come, there is no way in this world to attain or know it, for in this world we know of no other good, save that of the body, for which we crave; but that Good is exceedingly exalted and has no estimate alongside the good of this world save as a figure of speech; but by the way of truth to draw a comparison between the Good in store for the soul in the World to Come and the good of the body by eating and drinking in this world is impossible. Forsooth, that Good is so great that by no search can it be attained, and by no form of estimate and comparison can it be comprehended, even as David said: &#x201C;Oh how great is Thy goodness which Thou hast treasured up for those that fear Thee&#x201D; (Ps. 31.19).</p>
<p>7. How David longed and craved for the life in the World to Come! even as it is said: &#x201C;If I had not believed to look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living&#x201D; (Ibid. 27.13). We were long since informed by the ancient sages that it is not within the power of man to attain clearly the good of the World to Come, nor to know its grandeur beauty and quantity, save only the Holy One, blessed is He! and that all the good the prophets did prophesy for Israel are none else save corporeal matters, of which Israel will enjoy during the Messianic era, when government will be restored to Israel; but as the good in the life of the World to Come has neither estimate nor comparison, the prophets did not compare it to aught so as to not lessen it by comparison. This is what Isaiah said: &#x201C;Neither hath an eye seen a God besides Thee, Who worketh for him that waiteth for Him&#x201D; (Is. 64.3), as if saying: &#x201C;The good which the eye of a prophet had not seen, and none save God saw it, did God make for man who waits for Him. The sages declared: &#x201C;All of the prophets combined prophesied not save concerning the Messianic era, but the World to Come no eye saw, O God, besides Thee&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn472">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. As for the reason why the sages called it &#x201C;the World to Come&#x201D;:<sup><xref rid="fn473">9</xref></sup> it is not because it is not now in existence, so that it might be inferred that this world will be destroyed and thereafter will come that world; the matter is not so, for that World is and ready, even as it is said: &#x201C;Oh how great is Thy goodness, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee; which thou hast wrought for them that take their refuge in Thee&#x201D; (Ps. 31.19&#x2013;20). They called it not World to Come, save alone because that life comes to man after the life of this world wherein we exist with a body and soul, and this life is found by man first.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IX</h1>
<p>1. Now, after it is known that the reward and the good which we will acquire for observing the precepts and the way of the Lord according to what it is written in the Torah consist of life in the World to Come, even as it is said: &#x201C;That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days&#x201D; (Deut. 22.7), and that the punishment inflicted upon the wicked who abandoned the righteous paths described in the Torah consists of excision, even as it is said: &#x201C;That soul shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him&#x201D; (Num.15.31), what is this which it is written throughout the Torah, if ye will hearken you will be overtaken by thus, but if ye will not hearken you will be met with such, and all those things are in this world, for instance, plenty, famine, war, peace, government, oppression, permanency in the land, exile, success in undertakings, its failure, and other similar text in the Covenant? All those things were and will be true, and as long as we observe the precepts of the Torah all the good of this world will overtake us, and as long as we transgress them we will be met by those evil things described therein. Nevertheless, neither are those good things the end of the reward for observing the commandments nor are those evil things the end of the punishment to be inflicted upon one who violates the precepts. For so are all these matters balanced: The Holy One, blessed is He! bestowed upon us this Torah as a tree of life, and whosoever conducts himself after the prescribed order therein, and studies to know it with a complete and upright knowledge, he acquires therewith life in the World to Come. And, in the measure of his works and wisdom he obtains his acquisition. We were moreover, assured in the Torah that if we will observe it in joy and out of goodness of soul, and constantly meditate in its wisdom, He will detach from us all such things which prevent us from observing it, such as sickness, war, famine and the like. He will, in addition thereto, be bountiful unto us by giving us all good which sustain our hands to observe the Torah, as plenty, peace, and an increase in silver and gold, so that we be not occupied all of our days in the things that are of bodily need, but, instead, be at leisure to study wisdom and observe the precept in order to acquire life in the World to Come. Even so it is said in the Torah: &#x201C;And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments, before the Lord our God, as He hath commanded us&#x201D; (Deut. 6.24&#x2013;25). He made likewise known to us, that if we will purposely abandon the Torah, and busy ourselves with the vanities of the times, as the subject is spoken of, saying: &#x201C;But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked (Ibid. 32.15). The True Judge will detatch from the forsakers all the good of this world which had strengthened their hands so that they kicked, and bring upon them all the evil to prevent them from acquiring the World to Come, so that they be lost in their wickedness. This is as it is written in the Torah: &#x201C;Because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things; therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy who the Lord shall send against thee&#x201D; (Ibid. 28. 46&#x2013;47) Consequently, the interpretation of all those blessings and curses is this way: As if saying, if you have served the Lord with joyfulness and observed His way, he will bestow in abundance these blessings upon you and set at a distance the curses from you, so that you be at leisure to grow wise in the wisdom of the Torah, and to busy yourselves therein, and so that you will merit life in the World to Come, and to do you good in the world which is all good, and prolong your days in the world which is unending, and you will find yourselves acquiring two worlds, to good living in this world, which will bring to a life in the World to Come, for if one does not acquire wisdom and good works here he has nothing else to acquire it with, even as it said: &#x201C;For there is no work, no device, no knowledge nor wisdom in the grave (Ecc. 9.10). But if you have forsaken the Lord, and did err in eating drinking and prostitution, and their like, he will bring upon you those curses and detach from you all blessings until you will end your days in confusion and dread, and your will have neither a heart of leisure nor a sound body to perform the precepts, so that you lose the life in the World to Come, as a consequence whereof you will have lost two worlds; for, as long as a man is occupied in this world with sickness, war and hunger he can not be engaged either in wisdom or in precepts, by which to acquire the World to Come.</p>
<p>2. Because of this, all Israel their prophets and their scholars craved for the Messianic era so that they may rest up from tyrannical government which do not give them the tranquility to study the Torah and observe the precepts as they ought to, and so that they may find the peacefulness of mind to increase wisdom in order to acquire life in the World to Come. For, in those days knowledge and wisdom and truth will increase, even as it is said: &#x201C;For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord&#x201D; (Is. 11.9); and it is again said: &#x201C;And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother&#x201D; (Jer. 31.34); and it is yet again said: &#x201C;And I will take the stony heart out of your flesh&#x201D; (Ez. 36.26), as that king who will arise from the seed of David will be gifted with wisdom more than Solomon, and great in prophecy nigh unto Moses our Master. He will, therefore, teach the whole people and point out to them the Lord&#x2019;s path, and all nations will come to listen to him, even as it is said: &#x201C;And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord&#x2019;s house shall be established in the top of the mountains&#x201D; (Is. 2.2). Nevertheless, the end of the whole reward, and the last good which has neither interruption nor diminution is life in the World to Come. As for the Messianic era, it is in this world, and the world goes on after its fashion, save only that Israel will again have a government. Indeed, the ancient sages have long since said: &#x201C;There is no difference between this world and the Messianic era, save alone in the oppression of government.<sup>1</sup></p>
<h1>CHAPTER X</h1>
<p>1. Let no man say: &#x201C;Behold, I perform the precepts of the Torah, and engage myself in its wisdom so that I will receive all the blessings described therein, or so that I will merit the life in the World to Come; and I will separate myself from the transgressions against which the Torah gave warning so that I will escape the curses described therein, or so that I will suffer excision from the life in the World to Come&#x201D;. It is improper to serve the Lord in such way, for whosoever serves the Lord in such way, he is a worshiper because of fear, which is neither the degree of the prophets nor the degree of the sages. And the Lord should not be worshiped that way, save only by ignorant men, women and infants who are trained to worship because of fear, until their knowledge increases when they will worship because of love.</p>
<p>2. The worshiper because of love, engages himself in the study of the Torah and the observance of precepts and follows the paths of wisdom on no account in the world, neither for fear of evil nor in order to inherit the good; but he does the true thing because it is true, and in the end the good comes because thereof,. That degree is a great degree, indeed and not every scholar attains it; for such was the degree of Abraham our father, whom the Holy One, blessed is He! called His beloved, because he worshiped not, save because of love, and it is, furthermore, the degree concerning which the Holy One, blessed is He! commanded through Moses, saying: &#x201C;And thou shalt love the Lord thy God&#x201D; (Deut. 6.5); for, when man will love the Lord with a proper love, he will momentarily perform all of the commandments because of love.</p>
<p>3. And what is the proper love? He shall love the Lord with an exceeding great and very strong love so that his soul be tied to the love of the Lord, finding himself in a constant tremor, as if he were suffering of lovesickness, when his mind is free because of love for that woman, being continuously agitated about her, whether he sitting down, or whether he is standing up, even when he is eating and drinking. More than this should the love for the Lord be in the heart of those who love him, meditating therein constantly, even as He commanded us: &#x201C;With all thy heart and with all thy soul&#x201D; (Ibid.). This is what Solomon allegorically said: &#x201C;For I am love-sick&#x201D; (Songs 2.5). And, the whole book, Song of Songs, is an allegory on this subject.</p>
<p>4. Said the ancient sages: &#x201C;Peradventure you will say, behold, I study the Torah so that I will become rich, so that I will be called Rabbi, or so that I will receive reward in the World to Come, learn from what it is said: &#x201C;That thou mayest love the Lord&#x201D; (Deut. 30.20), all that you do, you shall not do save because of love. The sages, moreover, said: &#x201C;For his commandments crave exceedingly, but not for the reward of His commandments&#x201D;. And the great sages likewise commanded particularly their intelligent and progressive disciples: &#x201C;Be not like servants who minister to their master on condition of receiving a reward; but be like servants who minister to their master without condition of receiving a reward&#x201D;; for, because he is the master it is proper to minister to him, as if saying, minister because of love.</p>
<p>5. He who engages himself in the study of the Torah in order to receive a reward, or in order to prevent himself from being overtaken by punishment, is one who studies the Torah not for its own sake. But he who studies it neither because of fear nor because of reward, but because of love for the Lord of the whole earth Who commanded concerning it, is one who studies it for its own sake. Therefore when instructions are given to infants, to women and the ignorant in general, they should not be instructed save to worship because of fear, until their knowledge will increase, and they will became wise in wisdom, when this secret is revealed to them little by little, and get them acquainted with this subject slowly, until they will attain and know it, when they will serve Him because of Love.</p>
<p>4. It is a known and clear matter<sup><xref rid="fn474">2</xref></sup> that the love for the Holy One, blessed is He! does not become tied up within the heart of man unless he will constantly feel its proper tremor, and abandon everything in the world save that alone, even as He commanded: &#x201C;With all thine heart and with all thine soul&#x201D; (Ibid. 6.5). No one loves the Holy One, blessed is He! save by the measure of knowledge that he knows Him. According to that knowledge will that love be; if it be small, the love will be small; if it be abundant, the love will be abundant. It is, therefore, necessary for man to dedicate himself to understand and acquire intelligence in the sciences and reasonings which make known to him his Owner, in the measure of power that man possesses to understand and attain it, as we have elucidated it in the treatise concerning the Foundations of the Torah.</p>

But the meaning of &#x2018;Sealed instantly&#x2019; is, that they will not complete their days of the years alloted to them at birth. And the source of this matter is found in Yebamot, 50a&#x201D;. Virtues and vices are not measured by man, to condemn one to death, or ask why he is still living. God is the sole judge thereof. One virtue of one man, or one vice, might either save or be the cause of destruction of the whole world (See Kiddushin, 39b&#x2013;49a). Maimonides refers to Hosea, 7. 9. and to Genesis, 18. 20. to teach us that only God judges our iniquities, and whenever destruction comes to pass, His judgment should be justified. C. G.</p>

<ftnote id="fn423"><sup>6</sup>&#x201C;When the vices and virtues of man are weighed etc. This is part of the potpourri he made of the texts and imagines in his mind that both are of one subject, whereas they are of divers kind and very far apart. Because he saw in Rosh ha-Shanah (16b&#x2013;17a) &#x2018;And the Abundant in Goodness turns the scale opposite goodness &#x2018;and then (Ibid.) &#x2018;Rabbi Ishmael&#x2019;s school transmitted that He removes the sins one by one in rotation, for such is the rule. Again he saw in Yoma (85b) &#x2018;Rabbi Jose Bar Judah said: &#x2018;if a man sins, the first and the second and the third time he is forgiven, but the fourth time he is not forgiven&#x2019;, he fixed it in his mind that both these refer to one subject; but are very far apart. Rabbi Ishmael&#x2019;s transmission refers to the Great Day of Judgment, and to save the intermediary category from Gehenna, in support of the House of Hillel&#x2019;s contention, but there is no mention there of the wiping out of sin. Whereas this of Rabbi Jose Bar Judah refers to this world and to the beginning of man&#x2019;s conduct, from the day he became old enough to be punished for his sins and onward, whose first, second and third transgression which he encountered, if he did repent of them, although they be of the major sins which require both, suffering and the Day of Atonement, to be wiped off, those first do not require it, for they were entirely forgiven. This is the outline of the texts and their component part. Moreover, there is no difference in the Gemara between an individual and a congregation, and I do not know where he found such distinction&#x201D;. The text in the Talmud (Yoma, 86b) does make a distinction between an individual and a congregation. (q. v.) The <small>RABD&#x2019;S</small> copy of the Talmud evidently had it not. As for the subject matter of both quotations, Maimonides again showed a correct attitude. The <small>RABD</small> failed to quote Raba&#x2019;s provision of, &#x201C;But his own sins are not wiped off&#x201D;, which supports the entire contention given in the text herein. C. G.</ftnote>

Many greater and better than he followed this opinion according to what they saw in phrases, and more particularly in the texts of the Agadot (legends of the Talmud) which misdirect opinions&#x201D;. Possibly the version of this criticism was tampered with, and should rather stand corrected in the language of the Joseph Albo (Ikkarim, 2. 41) which is much more intelligent, not to say polite: &#x201C;Although the component part of belief is so, nevertheless, he who believes His Being corporeal because he understood the language of Scriptural phrases and the Midrash literally, deserves not to be called an atheist&#x201D;. Of course, even in the version before us, the <small>RABD</small>. does not differ in principle with Maimonides.

G.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn455"><sup>7</sup>&#x201C;This being so etc. This one did not follow the custom of scholars; for no man begins a thing which he knows not how to finish it, whereas he commenced with inquiries and questions and left the matter under question and turned it around to faith. It would have been better for him to leave the matter to the innocence of the innocent, not to awaken their hearts and leave their mind in doubt, lest, during some hour, a suspicion will enter their heart concerning it. Moreover, although there is no convincing reply to this question, it is best to lean himself upon a partial answer like this, saying: If either the righteousness or wickedness of man would have been dependent upon the decree of the Creator, may He be blessed!, we would be saying that His knowledge is His decree, then would the question be to us very difficult, indeed. But now, since the Creator ceded this power from His Hand to the hand of the man himself, His knowledge can not be said to be a decree, but it is similar to the knowledge of the astrologists who know by another power what the conduct of a certain person would be. And, it is common knowledge that from the smallest to the biggest thing which happens to man the Creator transmitted to the power of the planets, only He endowed him with an intelligence to sustain himself, and be delivered from the influence of the planet, and this very same is the power endowed to man to be either good or bad, and only the Creator knows the power of the planet and its movements whether it be within the power of the intelligence of one to be delivered from its influence or not. And, such knowledge is not a decree. But even this is not a comparison&#x201D;. Maimonides deemed it best to manifest the shortcomings of man&#x2019;s mind, particularly for the benefit of such who do ask questions of this kind, to teach that the human mind has its limitations, and that because it can not attain man shall not say: &#x201C;It is not so&#x201D;, but, &#x201C;I do not know&#x201D;. As for the <small>RABD</small>&#x2019;s attempt to make a comparison between the knowledge of the Creator and that of the astrologist, it is evident that he was still under a certain influence of a school of thinkers to which, evidently, Maimonides did not belong.

<ftnote id="fn460"><sup>4</sup>&#x201C;Now.. is it not written etc. These are unseasoned, lengthy words; by the life of my head, I am tempted to say, they are childish words. Should the Creator say to the perverters: &#x201C;Why did thou turn aside, I made no mention of thy name, to afford thee the excuse of saying that I decreed it against thee&#x201D;, the perverters will say to Him: &#x201C;Upon whom then is Thy decree applicable, if on those who did not turn aside, behold, Thy decree was not established&#x201D;. But of, this Verse &#x201C;And this people will rise up, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land&#x201D;, we long ago suggested that in the subject of the foreknowledge of God there is no connection with predestination, much less can it be utilized here, seeing that even Moses said: &#x201C;For I know that after my death ye will in any wise deal corruptly&#x201D; (Deut. 31.29), and preceding this he, moreover, said: &#x201C;Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the Lord; and how much more after my death?&#x201D;. How much more, then could the Creator speak thus without it being a decree? As for the subject of the Egyptians, it is no question at all for two reasons: first, it is a known doctorine that God inflicts no punishment against a wicked man unless it be through a more wicked man than he, whenafter that wicked man will have retribution visited upon him; For, so it is said: &#x201C;O Ashur, the rod of Mine anger&#x201D;, (Is. 10.5), but, &#x201C;When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spiled&#x201D; (Ibid. 33.1); because of thy wickedness, and haughtiness of thy heart, and vain glory against Me. The Egyptians, too, were wicked and it was meet that they receive the plagues; yet, if they had listened to Moses at first and let the children of Irsael go forth, they would neither have been plagued nor drowned in the Red Sea; but the spitefulness of Pharoah, and his insulting words against the Creator in the presence of His messenger caused the punishment to be visited upon him. Second, because the Creator said: &#x201C;And they shall afflict them&#x201D; (Gen. 15.13), but they afflicted them with rigour, put some of them to death, and killed others by drowning, as the subject is spoken of saying: &#x201C;I was but a little angry, but they helped for evil&#x201D; (Zech. 1.15); they were, therefore, found guilty&#x201D;. Rabbi Abraham De Butin, too, criticises Maimonides for delving into this subject again, after he already gave his opinion that we can not comprehend the foreknowledge of God in the preceding chapter. The RiTBa, in defending Maimonides, here falls in an error regarding the <small>RABD</small>, by attributing to him knowledge of Kabalah, an attribute belonging to <small>RABD</small> I. With all the commentaries silent, it is evident that, as far as this defence of the doctorine of self-will versus predestination is concerned, it must be considered weak. The text of this paragraph, however, lends itself to very strong points. The parallelism herein contained is more than of passing strength. Of course, Maimonides establishes the ultimate point upon Faith; but his arguments are chiefly directed to offset contradictions to the Torah. In this he succeeded. The <small>RABD</small>, too, upholds the doctorine of choice of action as against predestination. C.G.</ftnote>

Chr. 36.9 is said to have been eight years old when he ascended the throne of David, and reigned three years and ten days, and in Second Kings, 24.8, is said to have been eighteen years old, and reigned three years. He was the grandfather of Zerubbabel, and was a prisoner thirty-seven years. However, in First Chr. 3.19, it is said that Zerubbabel was the son of Pedaiah, brother of Shealtiel. Maimonides, evidently did not accept this version. G.</ftnote>

The Talmud (Sanhedrin, 64b) defines &#x201C;Hikorat&#x201D; literally, being cut off of itself, to refer to this world; and &#x201C;Tikorat&#x201D;, literally, being cut off by another, refers to the World to Come.

<ftnote id="fn467"><sup>3</sup>&#x201C;The World to Come harbors neither body nor aught of a concrete form etc. This man&#x2019;s words are in my eyes nigh to such who assert that there is no resurrection to body but the souls alone. But, by the life of my head, this was not the opinion of our sages, may their memory be blessed! Behold, they have said: &#x201C;The righteous are prepared to rise up in their garments, deduct major from minor, by comparison of a grain of wheat&#x201D; (Ketubot, 111b); and they left instructions to their children, saying: &#x201C;Bury us not in either white or black garments, lest I be meritorious and be resurrected&#x201D; (Shabbat, 114b); and they have again said: &#x201C;The righteous will never again return unto dust, but remain standing in their concrete form&#x201D; (Sanhedrin, 92a); and yet again they said: &#x201C;They will rise in their deformities, but will be healed&#x201D; (Ibid. 91b). All of which is conclusive proof that the dead will arise with their bodies and remain alive. Nevertheless, it is possible that the Creator will set them in strong, healthy forms as are the forms of angels, and as is the form of Elijah, of good memory!, when the garlands, too, will be literally and naturally, not in similitude&#x201D;. Evidently the <small>RABD</small> erred in placing the World to Come instead of resurrection. <small>RAB</small> (Berakot, 17a) is authority for the contents of this paragraph in the Maimoni text, in so far as the World to Come is concerned. Of course, the <small>RABD</small>&#x2019;s words are true with respect to resurrection, but Maimonides herein speaks of the World to Come, and not of resurrection. C. G.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn471"><sup>7</sup>&#x201C;And the sages, figuratively, named etc. If this be the Banquet, no Cup of Benediction can be herein. Silence would have been best for him&#x201D;. The <small>RABD</small> refers to Pesahim. 119b, and to Psalms, 116. 13. The entire conception of the <small>RABD</small> is contradictory to the opinion of Rab (Berakot, 17a), even though it is established that he erred in placing the World to Come instead of resurrection. The accepted doctorine, according to all commentaries on Maimonides is this: The dead will be resurrected. Life will then go on for a time. Then life as we know it will cease completely, when the era of the World to Come will be inaugurated. In all there are four distinct eras: (1) this world, as at present; (2) Messianic era; (3) era of Resurrection; (4) era of the World to Come. C. G.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn473"><sup>9</sup>&#x201C;As for the reason why the sages called it etc. It appears that he denies that the world will again be without form and void, and that the Holy One, blessed is He! will renew His world, as the sages have said: (Sanhedrin 97a.) Six thousand years will this world last, and one thousand years it will be desolate, as a consequence the world after that is a new one&#x201D;. It is strange, indeed, that those who criticised Maimonides should have given so little of their thought to his text. What if this world will be desolate a thousand years, and a new one created, would that alter the life after death of which he speaks? C. G.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn474"><sup>2</sup>&#x201C;It is a known and clear matter etc. This &#x201C;tremoring&#x201D; we know at what he is pointing. We interpret this word-Shogeh-as refering to either of two subjects: singing, as &#x201C;Shiggaion&#x201D; of David (Ps. 7.1), and the other, because of its love you will &#x201C;err&#x201D; in the subjects, that is you will pay no attention to it&#x201D;. Maimonides knew his Hebrew. See Ez. 45.20; and Prov. 20. 1. G.</ftnote>
